">We influenced at least two other American families over the past 20 or so years to buy   
land and build houses in Nova Scotia, and they have contributed   
similarly to the Nova Scotia economy; they, too, are feeling unwanted

 can’t afford a tripling of their property taxes.

needs to raise money to improve health care, housing, and for other   
needs, but to do it in this short-sighted and punitive way looks like   
economic suicide for a province that depends so much on people from away  
 contributing. 

The point of the tax as I understand it isn't to raise money for healthcare. The point is to make sure locals have a chance at entering the housing market that is too hot because of outside money / remote work, etc. 

These people are going to a province and enjoying its offering, hiring its people (who have suppressed wages compared to other parts of Canada), and are acting as if this is some kind of public service. It is not. You are not entitled to override the wishes of a place because of the zero's in your bank account. I also call BS that they have contributed 750k to the economy of their VACATION HOME and claim they can't afford what is likely to be an increase of a few hundred or a thousand dollars on rural property.

"Using your example, the one property in the neighbourhood that is not a Nova Scotia resident, does not pay Nova Scotia income taxes, which are generally higher than other provinces. Because of this they pay less taxes to Nova Scotia than their neighbours who pay Nova Scotia income taxes. These additional taxes may actually result in the non-residents paying closer to the same amount as their neighbours. Also, the non resident likely makes a higher wage than their neighbours even if their houses are the same value. As you said, people that make more should pay their fair share. I live next to two lawyers on one side and a retired couple on the other. I definitely pay less income tax than the lawyers and more income tax than the retirees.

"Hey. I worked in insurance before. 

So the answer is the colour could potentially make your premium higher depending on multiple factors. 

Usually the insurance company will not make premiums higher for basic car colours (like white, black, blue, red). They will however increase the price if the colour is rare/custom and you pick insurance coverage that covers your car. For example, if you don’t like the colours the dealership offers you can ask them to make a custom colour, which in turn makes you pay more for the vehicle. Your car will be more expensive than a white car with the same feature because you added a custom colour. Since the car is more expensive, it will cost the insurance company more money to replace/fix it. The same thing too if you have a limited edition colour or after market customization. 

The best thing for OP to do is to contact a trusted broker for some options. Depending on his/her job place, school or subscription to any society they may be entitled to a discount.",t2_jr36z,elplizzie,0,1649000655.0,0,t1_i38g8ko,i38g8ko,False,Friendly-Pace-5634,t3_tvayz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tvayz7/car_insurance/,Car insurance,/r/halifax/comments/tvayz7/car_insurance/i38g8ko/,1,r/halifax,0,1

"I think we both agree almost everyone buys property with investment being somewhere in their rationale. Yes the letter writer is not the same as someone that buys ten properties or flips a property in a year. They did sell at a time when they would have made a tremendous profit and they are buying large pieces of land that could be subdivided, so yes I am skeptical. It’s kind of a people in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones kind of viewpoint. They may have their reasons and be very nice people. Bottom line is that they made an investment, it worked out, and they chose to make that investment again. That’s close enough that throwing the stone is a bad idea.

I am actually concerned about some small towns because I am aware of how seasonal residents help keep them going. That being said, I’ve seen some of these towns still lose basic resources (banks, gas stations, etc) because seasonal residents don’t create year round demand. I’ve also seen some of these towns have housing problems now because properties that would have sat on the market for years a few years ago are now selling in days for asking or over. It might have been somewhat charitable to buy in some of these places 10 years ago but that’s not the case now. I think remote work had a huge effect on that. I also just generally dislike this notion that buying a vacation home in a rural community is charitable. It’s not. It’s enjoyable and/or and investment for the owner. They may have contributed but that doesn’t give them some altruistic high ground. They don’t pay income taxes, so they can pay a higher property and/or deed tax to compensate for that. They could also sell if they really can’t or don’t want to pay. They can also move here permanently if they love the area that much.

"I am going to laugh and laugh and laugh when the unintended consequences of this tax grab comes to fruition in a couple of years.

Because there are ALWAYS consequences of broad based taxes that no one anticipated.

The affordable housing problem is lack of supply and I am very confident this property tax will not address the supply issue. 

Full disclosure - I am one of the unlucky ones that will be affected by this.  I was a long time resident of NS (raised kids) but moved away. 15+ years ago we purchased a renovated and old farmhouse in a remote area of NS that had sat empty for 10yrs. There are limited employment opportunities in the area.  

The effect of this new legislation is to triple our annual tax cost. Of course we could “rent” the property to someone to avoid the tax, then again, it’s in a remote area w limited employment opportunities, so where do we find tenants able to pay “fair market” rent values?

So what is my strategy to cope?

Simple.  Cut back in spending.  We had several renovation projects planned for this year that we will dramatically scale back or cancel all together. This contributes to the local economy, but I guess NS Govt needs that $$ more than the local contractors and suppliers. 

How else do I respond - simply speak the truth.  I travel a lot for work and when I tell people I’m originally from NS we usually get a lot of positive responses. In the past I have always encouraged this but no longer.  I will be telling everyone I meet what a shithole NS has become.  Possibly some of the worst health care on the continent - both in terms of accessibility and outcomes/results. Roads they only slightly above “third world” status but many well below and a weather climate that is consistently crappy and at best mediocre. 

And for all the people on the sub (/Halifax) that are having difficulty with rents in the city or were hoping to buy a home, i do feel for you. But this is a golden opportunity! Property values in rural NS will likely moderate some and as stated in the legislation and one of the ways a property owner can avoid this tax is to rent their property.  So perhaps those looking to purchase a home or need rental accommodation can move to the shore Brule Shore, our Ecum Secum or Parrsboro or the Margaree Valley. I’m sure there will be a number of purchase or rental opportunities available in the future.

It’s great to demonize the “other” and point the finger that they are causing the problem , but as mentioned I will have a hearty chuckle when the unintended consequences of this broad, poorly targeted tax become known.",t2_ialz1,gesk2020,0,1648994695.0,0,t1_i3830mk,i3830mk,True,ParentPregSon22,t3_tv7osd,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tv7osd/comefromaway_tax_ruins_22year_romance_with_nova/,Come-from-away tax ruins 22-year romance with Nova Scotia,/r/halifax/comments/tv7osd/comefromaway_tax_ruins_22year_romance_with_nova/i3830mk/,1,r/halifax,0,1

"I'm reading a newer econ textbook. It's interesting because it doesn't present market situations like housing as supply and demand. It presents them as dictator games. Essentially a renter goes into a market with a certain level of hours that they can allocate to housing. A landlord wants a certain price. The more insecure the renter is (eg has no fall back housing) the higher the price a landlord can get. If the renter doesn't have to take the landlord's deal then they can get a better price on housing. 

So the take away is more housing could make better conditions for renters. But at the same time you could also just increase wages (the number of hours that renters have to allocate to housing have more value). Or you could lower the population of renters (end growth is good policies). In this theory there's a point where both renters and landlords can get what they want but under conditions where a renter's hourly wage is low and they don't have housing options that they can substitute this cannot happen in a way that is fair to renters.",t2_4puyq,Erinaceous,0,1648994251.0,0,t1_i382495,i382495,False,pineconeporridge,t3_tv71i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tv71i4/fasttracked_port_wallace_development_is_like/,Fast-tracked Port Wallace development is like putting Truro in Dartmouth,/r/halifax/comments/tv71i4/fasttracked_port_wallace_development_is_like/i382495/,1,r/halifax,0,1

"Xenophobia is never a good look for a province or municipality.

While there is no doubt the people who wrote those letters are well to do and not your average redditor who believes they are perpetually hard done by, the points they raise are valid. Summer people are what keep a large part of the economy alive in places like the South Shore and Bay of Fundy coast. They are coming here with their money and spending it. They employ people to maintain and improve their properties, buy lots of things while they are here and pay 15% HST, and pay property taxes. It is unclear from the article where the extra property tax they will now be charged is going, whether to the municipality or the province, but whatever. If they get sick while they are here, they get a bill and are not a burden on the health care system. If the new taxes go to the municipality, they are contributing much more to that organization than the cost of any services they may use. This is badly misguided knee-jerk legislation designed to appeal to the infamous attitudes of many here who like to penalize people who are more successful than they are. It is not too big of a leap to equate this to legislation mandating extra taxes on people of certain faiths, skin color, or nationality because we don't like them either.

I am not effected by this tax but I am aware that the government could decide to increase my taxes since I have a property that is not my primary residence.

It is literally no different than the fact that I pay more taxes than other Nova Scotians because I make more money than them. Raising taxes doesn’t take the property away from anyone. They still have an asset and they can make a decision based on their finances whether to keep it or sell it. That is exactly what I would do.

"Yes, this makes sense. And nevertheless I am not quite ready to say this is the best we can do and let the virus do what it will. The impact is still too high. Both directly and from follow-on effects like no surgeries and ab uncertain economic and health environment in general.

How does your analysis take into account the cyclical nature of infection? I don't see this as restrictions forever indefinitely. It's during period of high prevalence in order to a) maintain healthcare and b) shorten the duration and frequency of impact. In fact this is what we've been doing all along. There were plenty of periods with no masking and wide reopening, especially here where things were well managed. In places where they weren't things reopened too but at great physical and psychological cost. If you're saying if you went back to March 2020 you'd choose to be in Florida over NS fine, but I sure wouldn't.

I think this period is especially hard because we have two waves in quick succession. And people are tired so ""just a little longer"" seems like a false promise. But I think it's reasonable to believe that we have the chance to drive things to shortly be much less prevalent again. Vs. accept the baseline being no surgeries and lots of death. Which BTW is a contagious attitude, they're already defunding vaccine development, etc. 

This is a mass giving up. There will be no ventilation improvements. No surveillance. Drug development may slow down. This strategy runs the risk of being much more expensive in the long run. Every other time we've tried it (every wave) it's been a clear mistake and made things worse. Maybe it'll be fine and it'll get milder and us all catching COVID 4x/year won't have any repercussions. To me the risk/reward balance there looks off the hook.

"Fair enough but I disagree for the reason that I provided above - maintaining ER zoning constricts the amount of land available for more dense development resulting in builds that do not meet the needs of Haligonians. ER2 is significantly less dense than the middle housing described in the link (and subsequent book) I provided above. In my opinion maintaining ER zoning conveys a hostility towards middle housing development, accelerates sprawl, drives costs, and ensures the mode of future housing development deepens the urban/suburban divide. 

  
""Upzoning"" COR, CEN or HR is great but the restrictive nature of those corridors from a land availability perspective pushes developers to build housing that does not meet the needs of the city. It's basic economics - scarce resources are inherently more expensive and drive investors to require greater returns. It's effectively a council-created deadweight loss scenario. The practical result of this artificial scarcity is small, family unfriendly and expensive units. We need a diverse cross-section in the core (young, old, families, otherwise, poor, wealthy) but what is currently being built marginalizes families and exacerbates the strain on low income earners. 

  
Needless to say we could go back and forth on this issue but I think this is an area where council is significantly out of step with the needs of the city. I also think this zoning approach makes it tougher on council. You're forced to provide improved transit in a doomed commuter system that has no viable solution within our car-dependant suburban paradigm. You're tasked with creating affordable housing which, not only isn't your mandate, isn't a problem government is capable of solving. You need to raise revenues but ER zoning is more costly to service and less profitable as a tax base. I appreciate the situation that council is in and and that it acknowledges the housing problem but I think the approach to zoning only deepens the crisis.",t2_4rp4r,bootselectric,0,1648948625.0,0,t1_i36499a,i36499a,False,wayemason,t3_tto4dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tto4dd/new_update_ukraine_provincial_planning_takeover/,"New Update: Ukraine, Provincial Planning takeover, Robie demolitions, Regional Plan review, more",/r/halifax/comments/tto4dd/new_update_ukraine_provincial_planning_takeover/i36499a/,1,r/halifax,0,1

" I'm probably going to get hate for this. But I don't agree that the back seat is in any way safer than the front for the child's long as they have met all the criteria to sit in a booster seat. Maybe back in the old days the back was safer, but not now. im  OK with putting my kid on her booster in the front. I generally don't as she messes around too much. But  on occasion, when I've had the back seats flat I've put her up front.

The booster is self locating and doesn't strap down so that's no different. The hight adjustable seat belt in the front actually fits better as I can lower it to her shoulder height. The front airbag turns itself off as she's not heavy enough for the seat sensor, also she benefits from better side impact and seat airbags and seat belt tensioner. That and her head is now under the B pillar which is probably rhe strongest pillar In a roll over. Also the car is new so sitting anywhere in it would be safer than the back seat of anything made 20 years ago.

"Well, here is a letter from head of planning to the Chamber that outlines the numbers, which have also been reported in my newsletter, and in the press.  It explains the 24,000 approved units where the developers have not yet pulled permits, and some other similar issues.  Again, all of this has been public for months.:

Given the housing supply challenges we are all facing, we wanted to identify how much development could come online quickly as development permission is enabled today.  The purpose of this analysis was to inform the Regional Plan Review and provide us with information that will guide our policy focus over the short and moderate term.  
   
To do this, we identified areas where housing could be built today without any changes to policy or land use regulations. This is shown in Table 1 on page 9 in this document.  In many instances, the housing identified in this table would be permitted as-of-right, meaning the approvals process to bring this housing online is the shortest and most efficient approval process available.  
   
The 24,000 units represents developments that have been approved, but not yet progressed to Building Permit.  An example of this type of development is a development agreement that has been approved, where the developer has not come forward and requested a building permit. Another example would be where the first three phases of a subdivision have been built, but there are still remaining phases yet to be delivered.  
   
Significant intensification in the Regional Centre has already been enabled under the Centre Plan Package A. Right now, there are an estimated 61,000 residential units (net new residential; existing units are not included) enabled in policy and about 37,000 of these are residential units that could proceed straight to Building Permit or Site Plan Approval/Building Permit.    
    
In addition to examining this existing regulatory capacity, the ongoing Regional Plan Review is focused on creating new capacity by expanding the service boundary. Specific growth areas (Sandy Lake, Highway 102, Dartmouth East, and Akoma) are being recommended for study, and a special team is being organized around this so we have a dedicated group.

"> Let me ask you quite directly: *are the approvals you are making keeping up with the rate of migration into Halifax?* Clearly, the answer is no. 

You didn't answer my question, I guess that means I was correct that you are not keeping up with demand? From the recent press release: 

> the current housing deficit in the Halifax region is estimated to be at least 17,000 units and growing 

Pretty big deficit. The sort of thing that doesn't happen overnight. 

> And the other part this dogpile is missing is we are approving far more than is being built - the construction market is lagging here. We need more trades and more businesses to help address demand.

I don't doubt it, but that's the sort of thing that happens when you wait until you're 4 years into a housing crisis to really pump the gas on your approvals. 

Since I'm just talking based on the minimal information that's out there, why doesn't council just release their data.

">with as little impact to people's lives and deaths as possible

Little impact to people's lives would mean few to no restrictions. There is more to wearing masks everywhere than just the inconvenience of having a mask on your face. It impacts social dynamics and child development; that has been proven, unquestionably. While I haven't seen relevant research, I also think that there's a significant psychological toll on individuals. And this is the restriction with the least impact on people, the others have done much more damage.

In terms of limiting deaths, we have treatments and vaccines now. We may get better treatments in the future, but we have no way of knowing that so I think we should assume this is the best we're going to get. With that in mind, I think we can only limit the rate and not the cumulative deaths over long time spans-- once again because this disease isn't going anywhere. It's for this reason that I stopped wearing a mask; I don't believe my wearing a mask is going to protect anyone who will die from COVID because I think they're most likely going to be getting COVID in time anyway. I don't believe my wearing a mask protects me either because again, I was going to be getting it in time as well (and now have, although from a member of my household, so my wearing a mask wouldn't have helped anyway). For me, I'm glad that I got it sooner with stronger vaccine protection rather than later with potentially weaker vaccine protection. I think overall, the only thing restrictions are useful for now are reducing strain on the medical system. Since there was no significant push from government to bolster that system (at least not in a way that's worth talking about), then the strain will be felt unless we keep restrictions in place indefinitely-- and those restrictions could lose effectiveness at some point anyway. For me, I'm not willing to keep restrictions in place indefinitely. I wore my mask, I limited contacts, I got three shots and will get another, and I think two years was well long enough.

>Current consensus seems to be pretend it's over and look the other way which honestly I think is basically the same attitude you're critiquing government for.

I don't think anyone is doing that. I think a lot of people consider two years to be long enough and that we're conceding that the strategy of imposing restrictions is not tenable long term and has not really been as successful as it's chalked up to be. We're two years in and we're still talking about restrictions as an effective solution. Over the short term, I think they were, but I don't see what benefit we gain from kicking the can down the road any more.",t2_r0va3,tfks,0,1648938414.0,0,t1_i35qg8x,i35qg8x,False,KennethHaight,t3_tui7xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tui7xz/how_many_people_do_you_all_know_that_caught_covid/,How many people do you all know that caught COVID after the show at the Marquee last Saturday?,/r/halifax/comments/tui7xz/how_many_people_do_you_all_know_that_caught_covid/i35qg8x/,1,r/halifax,0,1

I’m not saying there isn’t a point to rentals. What I’m saying is anyone who buys a second dwelling should be taxed heavily. I believe it would deter smaller “investors” / landlords but anyone it could deter from buying a first time home and flipping it into a three bedroom rental would be a positive for those looking to buy. Seems like you’re looking at this hypothetical as bad because it wouldn’t increase rental units or might increase a monthly rent for someone and I’m looking at it as good because it could possibly increase the amount of housing stock as it might deter local “investors” and give more first time buyers a shot at a house that’s $315k instead of it going for 400k to someone who wants to rent it out.,t2_rvlfk,casestudy89,0,1648937365.0,0,t1_i35oand,i35oand,False,Bean_Tiger,t3_tufbs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tufbs0/ns_liberal_mla_proposes_exempting_1sttime_home/,N.S.

">Hopefully they will find a way to get those cancer surgeries going again some day even under those conditions.

The government was given two years to prepare. Honestly, I don't think it's reasonable for them to get much longer than that even if two years legitimately isn't enough time. I think at this point it's clear that the government needed to start training health care professionals en masse pretty much the moment the pandemic began. I think that would have been a good strategy and I think that it could have been reasonably predicted to be a good strategy even at the beginning of the pandemic... but I don't think it happened. The highest estimate for the cost to train a doctor in Canada is $400k. The government injected [$50 billion into the mortgage market](https://financialpost.com/real-estate/ottawa-to-buy-up-to-50-billion-in-mortgages-in-move-that-harkens-back-to-2008) in response to COVID. That same investment into health care would cover training for 125k doctors. You could cut that number in half, train over 60k doctors and many, many more nurses and support staff. Obviously there are ongoing costs associated with that, but this gives an idea of the impact that government money *could* have and why I think that government putting the blame on citizens is a fucking sham. Of course, this would have taken longer than two years, but I think a lot more people would have confidence in continuing COVID countermeasures for a few more years if government messaging was that ""we are training a legion, it will take 4-6 years, but we are going to war.""",t2_r0va3,tfks,0,1648926655.0,0,t1_i351z4j,i351z4j,False,KennethHaight,t3_tui7xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/tui7xz/how_many_people_do_you_all_know_that_caught_covid/,How many people do you all know that caught COVID after the show at the Marquee last Saturday?,/r/halifax/comments/tui7xz/how_many_people_do_you_all_know_that_caught_covid/i351z4j/,4,r/halifax,0,4

"I like noodle nami or bomber chicken allot, but not sure if bomber has eat in at all anymore.

Also, cheeky neighbour is pretty great, but I don’t go there allot, because I often pick all the other places I mentioned first.
