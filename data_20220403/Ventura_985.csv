"All of this. Nothing our federal or local government is doing is making home buying attainable here for anyone but the top 10% of incomes, or those who already own large assets. All these policies are on purpose. The people in charge are wealthy landowners themselves‚Äîthey don‚Äôt work for those who aren‚Äôt wealthy or don‚Äôt already own. And the majority of voters in CA are still homeowners, though if trends continue, this will change. 

The pandemic should have caused price corrections, but our government & the federal reserve made sure it didn‚Äôt. And now we‚Äôre punished with historic inflation/outrageous bubbling instead. Add this onto the housing crisis because California refuses to build, and wealthy WFHs from out of county streaming in, and you‚Äôve got a real üí© sandwich. Local median incomes are irrelevant. 

I don‚Äôt see it getting better here any time soon. Some price reductions, ok. 2011 prices, naw. That ship has sailed, barring a disaster the feds can‚Äôt print their way out of. Some of this inflation is permanent, how much remains to be seen. 

Housing affordability is not going to get better either when gov & NIMBYs actively suppress new housing here, and make it cost prohibitive for builders to build anything except ‚Äúluxury‚Äù housing. We also need regulations on flippers and investors, but good luck with that.

I hear you but believe this sentiment is out-dated. The best hedge against inflation is taking on low long-term fixed rate debt. Of all the folks I know who purchased RE within the last 5 years not one got an adjustable rate mortgage. That was 2008. And yes cost trends keep rising. But there are still 10x more buyers than there are homes for sale. $80K/year won‚Äôt cut it for an $800K house. The 10 buyers making offers on the $800K house are making $200-500K yearly. A lot of them are coming from outside the County. I don‚Äôt believe this is a sustainability issue; I believe it is a class issue. The middle class is fracturing. $100-150K a year is fast becoming the low-middle. Enough to enjoy a decent QoL but perhaps unable to own assets that will securitize their retirement. A lot of folks buying here over the last few years are doing so because they were getting priced out of their former cities.

"That seems very far-fetched. Sure we have inflation and sure some small to medium sized businesses are struggling but that is true always. The big indicators to look for are the ones attached to the big players in the economy. The large corps are crushing it while still being able to triage labor and material costs. The stock market is healthy. The real estate market is healthy. The top 30% have loads of equity in their investments. The top 1% continues to outpace everyone else in wealth allocation. Profit and market share are growing not receding. Fundamentally leverage is healthy for the big players. Markets are now globalized so the real competition is between the big players in US, Europe, Asia. The little guys and their struggles are insignificant to the larger narrative of capital continuing to float up to the top. There is no political will in the US to restructure even small portions of our economy to level the playing field. 

IMO the only depression is mental. Believing there is an opportunity to be had in 2-3 years when things fall apart is wishful thinking. I know many friends and peers that held that opinion year after year during upturns and downturns only to price themselves out of the RE market to a point where they are now paying more on rent than they would a mortgage.

"I moved here in 2005 and housing prices were absolutely crazy. At that time I had owned a few homes over the years but was looking to buy as I was going to settle here. $750K for a shitty condo in Oxnard, $850K to live on top of each other near Oxnard airport. I didn't spend much time in Ventura then. Then the bubble burst, I bought that shitty Condo for $400K and then there was a double dip and I bought a really nice executive home in the hills above Ventura for $630K. That house is now worth $1.5M and the shitty condo is worth $750K again. This is not affordable and it will correct. All I can tell you is to be ready when it corrects- have good credit and money for down and closing cost. You can also get involved locally because your local politicians are the ones that won't allow building here - all this farm land is all blocked off from building - It's a supply and demand problem and all they do is help the demand side with loans and grants to buy - it's stupid.",t2_ftzman74,Central_Centrificus,0,1648918095.0,0,t1_i34j1nv,i34j1nv,True,Joomama420,t3_tty1t7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ventura/comments/tty1t7/how_can_you_afford_to_live_here/,How can you afford to live here.,/r/ventura/comments/tty1t7/how_can_you_afford_to_live_here/i34j1nv/,3,r/ventura,0,3
"You‚Äôre not alone. My husband & I are elder millennials with median household income for this area & can‚Äôt afford to buy anything. You basically can‚Äôt afford to buy a SFH without $200k+ income at this point, or a massive downpayment. We can ‚Äúafford‚Äù rent and to save some money after that, but we‚Äôre unable to contribute enough to 401k, and live frugally with few luxuries (aside from the luxury of living in coastal CA lol). 

Rent increases & lack of space are a constant stress. We would love a bigger place, but that strains our budget too much to also have privacy, so we‚Äôre crammed in a tiny 480 sq foot cottage, with yard access & a storage unit. (We spent a decade in paper thin wall apartments, had horror story neighbors‚Äînot going back to that. Even peace in your own dwelling comes at a premium here.)

How people afford rent: high incomes or multiple incomes in one unit, or they got in years/decades ago & have a nice landlord who‚Äôs not jacking their rent. 

No one we know in our age group (of locals) bought homes here without help. Such as: 

- generous downpayment gifts from parents (like $50-100k+)
- Parents who bought their adult child a house & they are renting to own from their parents 
- employer downpayment assistance (to retain talent or talent leaves due to unaffordable housing) 
- special loan programs based on being a protected class
- Multiple family members buying one house together 
- Living with parents for many years while working full time to save up a huge DP
- Buying a home at top of budget & renting out rooms to afford the mortgage 
- Almost everyone we know bought during the last crash (or in the 1990s) & could never afford their homes today. This includes couples working in tech & medicine pulling in $150k+. The whole market is rigged to flush Boomers & the investor class with wealth & younger generations are paying the price for it. We know blue collar dudes in their 50s who bought small SFHs in the late 90s near the beach in Ventura, for the equivalent of $193k-$375k today. The properties are now worth $800k - 1.25 million. 
- A couple we know (both doctors) who own a successful practice serving the community, could not afford to buy SFH in Ventura & had to settle for a condo 

We‚Äôre still tied to this area for a bit longer due to husband‚Äôs job, but there is no financial future for us here & we‚Äôre bailing for a different state.

( at the time we lived in santa Ynez so going to Santa Maria was common for us and never had any problems) As I was finishing with the truck about to go look for parking I see her and the kids walking towards me.

There was actually a truck that caught on fire just north of the construction but because no one slowed down like they are supposed to in the construction zones and are not skilled drivers accidents happen.  Hopefully this takes those cars off the road and lightens your commute that much more.

His peers have been really great. Everyone is incredibly kind and he‚Äôs made a ton of good friends. 


The only bummer is that for a ‚Äúscience‚Äù based school- the focus on science in the younger grades is pretty slim. Not a huge deal because we foster that at home, though.

"Okay, cool.  I'm also from West Michigan (near Kalamazoo).  Ventura is my favorite city in Southern California.  It hasn't been bourgeoised to death yet by money coming in and fucking up its character and there is plenty to do, especially if you like being outdoors, and has good proximity to Los Angeles.  Downtown is amazing.

That being said there is always going to be some culture shock that you should be prepared for.  Rent is EXPENSIVE (like unbelievably so) and it's really going to be tough to secure housing out here if you don't already have a job.  Competition is steep and you're not going to get a lot of space.  The 101 cuts right through town and is noisy as hell.

Really encourage you to visit and get a feel for the city.  Take note of available rentals and go check them out in person so you can start understanding the neighborhoods you can likely afford.

"Palermo, downtown, has a large outdoor seating area (for now at least, while Main Street is still closed to traffic). Peirano‚Äôs is more than coffee but the coffee is good and it‚Äôs a lovely space. Simone‚Äôs at Kimball and Telegraph is always nice.

To meet people, find some groups that might be interesting and follow them on social media to get a sense of what they‚Äôre like, know when they‚Äôre having some event. For me, local politics has been how I‚Äôve met most of my friends. I‚Äôm not friends with anybody your age, but I have met plenty and they‚Äôre wonderful people. It‚Äôs not like sitting around arguing about the US Senate, more people that are active about something they care about in their community. Climate change, equity, trees, bikes, beaches, homelessness, housing, whatever.

I expect most places are like Ventura in that we‚Äôre mostly creatures of habit. People here are nice, welcoming, and they have their patterns and routines. If somebody seems unwelcoming it‚Äôs often because it‚Äôs a disruption of their routine. People don‚Äôt talk to strangers much on the bus, a bit in parks and hiking trails, but quite a lot at the Harbor, Pier, Promenade, Downtown. Because that‚Äôs what you do when you go to those places.

If you hike Arroyo Verde at 4pm on Tuesdays, after a few weeks you‚Äôll be one of the 4pm Tuesday regulars. Ditto coffee at Ficelle on Sunday morning or whatever. And as somebody new to town, you can always say ‚ÄúHi, I‚Äôm new here, sorry to bother you, can I ask you something? Isn‚Äôt there a park with hiking trails somewhere?‚Äù Venturans love to talk about their favorite places.",t2_6neo9iah,MikeForVentura,0,1643339743.0,0,t1_huj7zyi,huj7zyi,True,Black_Cat_0608,t3_sedlhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ventura/comments/sedlhz/suggestions_for_meeting_people/,Suggestions for meeting people,/r/ventura/comments/sedlhz/suggestions_for_meeting_people/huj7zyi/,5,r/ventura,0,5
