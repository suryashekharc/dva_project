Santa Monica has become such a shit hole. There isn’t a neighborhood in LA that I despise more. There is often only one lane for cars and there are crazy homeless people and criminals everywhere.

There will always be people in the street living in RVs in SoCal. Homeless in RVs don’t consent to temporary housing because they have solid shelter so that’s not a solution.

"And yet you posted the total compensation for both those social workers to make a point that “it doesn’t sound too bad” and that they’re well paid in comparison to others. Most people reading your post would automatically compare that dollar figure to their own gross salary because no one knows their own equivalent “total compensation”. No one knows how much their own disability benefits or other employment costs may cost their employer. Why even throw out the total compensation figures instead of just citing their gross pay for an apples-to-apples comparison that the majority of us can make?

The issue I see with that is these folks don’t want to fund temporary/permanent housing unless there are some rules attached (no drugs for example), and the homeless/RV folks don’t really want to work with a social worker or abide with those rules. Most of them would rather be left alone.

"**[Angelyne](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelyne)** 
 
 >Angelyne (born Ronia Tamar Goldberg, October 2, 1950) is an American singer, actress, media personality, and model who came to prominence in 1984 after the appearance of a series of iconic billboards in and around Los Angeles, California that read only ""Angelyne"" and pictured her posing suggestively. These caught the attention of local media outlets, and soon she received several offers for film roles, magazine interviews, and television show appearances. The main trademark of her celebrity persona is a pink Corvette.

"I truly want to have compassion for the unhoused. But when a meth zombie climbed the wall into my backyard, tried to enter my master bedroom through the patio slider, and terrified my daughter by staring in the window and speaking a gibberish language to her — I threw up my hands. I’m finding it very hard to have compassion anymore.

(In this instance, the LAPD came, took the man out of my backyard, and let him walk off down the street. I asked them to hold him for 24 hours for trespassing, or at the very least, drive him to a different area, and they refused. They said he was so out of his mind that he wouldn’t even remember where I lived.)",t2_94mpbc0j,Prudent_Fly_2554,0,1649001182.0,0,t1_i38hhpy,i38hhpy,False,AutoModerator,t3_tv8pwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/tv8pwv/los_angeles_daily_discussion_thread_sun_apr_03/,"Los Angeles Daily Discussion Thread - Sun, Apr 03",/r/LosAngeles/comments/tv8pwv/los_angeles_daily_discussion_thread_sun_apr_03/i38hhpy/,1,r/LosAngeles,0,1

These people were fine but the reason they are parked here is because there is a huge homeless encampment in the foliage on side of the 90 which was not fine and was pretty dangerous. Previously they and about 20 other RVs and vehicles were parked on Mesmer under the overpass on the other side of the homeless encampment and it was pretty sketch walking with my toddler through the area everyday on my way to the park. I am glad they were all cleared out but I hope they are able to get back on their feet. Most homeless people are just trying to find a place for themselves and scrap together a life but some have profound mental illnesses and can be unpredictable and violent. I’m not sure what the right answer is but the city doing nothing and letting these camps build up is just putting the responsibility onto citizens to deal with it on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis.,t2_33dv4,bentreflection,0,1648999881.0,0,t1_i38efjf,i38efjf,False,Cannabace,t3_tuyz98,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/tuyz98/antirv/,Anti-RV,/r/LosAngeles/comments/tuyz98/antirv/i38efjf/,1,r/LosAngeles,0,1
"Yeah, you have to dig your own car out. Also really sucks if the snow plow buried your car under a three foot snow drift.

There is zero sympathy for being late to work or school because you had to dig your car out, and if you live in an apartment building with lazy management who doesn't shovel the parking lot, then everyone's car is gonna get stuck if you get 1-2 feet of snow accumulation. You gotta shovel that shit quick before it becomes compacted and you literally cannot separate it from the pavement.

Everyone has a shovel by the door and usually a couple shovels in the trunk of their cars, along with road sand, salt, and defroster. If there's a big snow overnight and you have to be at work by 8, you know for damn sure nobody is going to be clearing out your building lot anytime soon so you wake up at 5am and start digging your car car out, and hand shoveling a path to the street for your car, and then maybe even shovel some of the street so your car can build up enough forward momentum to launch itself over the snowbank and then slippy slide its way to the highway.",t2_h5u7c,HoneyGrahams224,0,1648999711.0,0,t1_i38e18q,i38e18q,False,Cannabace,t3_tuyz98,https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/tuyz98/antirv/,Anti-RV,/r/LosAngeles/comments/tuyz98/antirv/i38e18q/,1,r/LosAngeles,0,1

After a big snow (one to two feet) it can take 30 to 45 minutes of fairly hard labor to clear off your car and shovel out a path to the street. Smaller snows it might take ten minutes.

> What if you have to go to a place?

You either dig yourself out or you don't go to that place. On big snow days people are generally pretty understanding if you're late or cancel due to the weather. 

> Does everyone have shovels like in their closets?

Yep. In your closets or in your garage or in the trunk of your car. If you're smart all three.

Walmart allows people to park and sleep in all of their parking lots, btw.

Also, van lifers travel and sleep in cities all over the country and somehow they have the decency to find commercial/designated areas that are NOT neighborhoods to do so. Most people that want to park their beat up RV with mechanical problems and not move them for months tend to be the ones who are suffering some kind of mental issue.

"> The report was an “all of the above” report, which recommended many changes beyond just a restructure of bureaucracy. Most notably was the finding that there is not one right answer, and that we need a combination of new housing, safe overnight parking, park policing, and a number of other measures.

It is amazing how quickly misinformation spreads. I assume you half-read the summary and then half-read the posts by the other user here who then misread it themselves.

This is absolutely ***not*** what the report said. This report was entirely about restructuring the bureaucracy. I have gone over that report a few times now and the summary a lot more times and nothing you are saying is in there.

I can only assume you are talking about the ""one-size-fits all approach"" that is mentioned in the summary and in the report. This is about LAHSA applying a ""one-size-fits all approach"" when it comes to delivering their services and how a more localized response should take over many of these responsibilities. See page 39, 43, etc. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything you mentioned.

Here are easy to access links for you to read the summary and the report

"First let me say that I don’t support/condone these asshole RVs parking on residential streets and taking up all of the spots…

Now that that’s clear… I need to vent about this whole “holding parking spots” thing:

I hate when people do this… in ALL forms.

I had to deal with that shit ALL OF THE TIME when I lived in KTown and got home from work at 10pm. My apartment building had no designated parking and there wasn’t any permit parking on the surrounding streets where I lived so I was SOL. I still remember parking 5 blocks away at times or spending 20 minutes looking for parking after driving home.

"Assuming by ""skytrain"" you mean elevated tracks, it'd actually be more expensive since you'd have additional infrastructure (i.e. elevated guideway) costs.

Also, LA Metro wouldn't have operational jurisdiction over all the lines.  Even though it's greater LA, transit operations are county-confined (LACMTA, OCTA, RTA, SBCTA).

Lastly, a lot of the lines would probably be deemed infeasible from a demand perspective.  Assuming that the routes are drawn to capture as many ""social centers"" (malls, parks, etc.) as possible, a lot are already covered by bus transit, so redundancy becomes wasteful.
