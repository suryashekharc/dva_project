"Haha. I'm well aware of the few historical accounts of hangings here. I've done a LOT of research on the matter. I've long kicked around the idea of doing a documentary about it, actually. And - sure - I'm also aware of the *claim* the hangings ***may not*** have been racially motivated, but: 

a) Modern travelers through the area couldn't/shouldn't be expected to understand that. They simply see the name and the adornment of nooses all over. People of color understandably mostly associate nooses with the KKK, after all. Considering we heavily rely on tourism, is that the best town branding strategy? 

b) Why would we want to embrace such a morbid and exceedingly small slice of our local history? We were only nicknamed Hangtown for *maybe* 5 years before church leaders at the time urged for a more neutral name and is why we were incorporated as Placerville.

c) Prior to that, it was also more popularly known as Old Dry Diggings—another highly historical (yet much more neutral) name which has all but been forgotten. Why, if it's truly about ""remembering our history""? The miners here called it such and that spanned a lot longer than the duration of these macabre hangings, of which there are only scant historical details of anyways.

All in all, it's something we should be remissed to talk about—not proud of, and certainly not hang nooses all over. The more you historically explore the subject the more one has to conclude there is definitely an element of white supremacy involved in fighting so vociferously to keep it around. (Fun fact: the dummy hanging on main street was overtly [dark skinned](https://miro.medium.com/max/995/1*jo1n4SE4saRpQyvMkBfKjg.jpeg) until replaced with more of a ""white man"" when I was a kid!

"A couple of points:

As someone who used to work for the county (in the mental health department). There are not a lot of resources for the homeless. Maybe better than in some areas but in general the resources are limited. The county has a good transitional housing program (but it's for mental health clients) but they keep cutting funding for it.

While I think what you say is correct about ""moderates"" we have some real numbers to look at. Trump won by almost 10 points in 2020 in El Dorado county. The majority of voters voted Yes on the gubernatorial recall election. El Dorado County is represented by Tom McClintock who takes the usual conservative stances on things like repealing the Affordable Care Act, was against same-sex marriage, is skeptical of human-caused global warming, opposes mail-in voting, etc.

I can't speak to Placerville proper (even though I lived in the city limits for 10 years I don't want to conjecture) but the county leans pretty solidly conservative.",t2_pkcun,anna_or_elsa,0,1635094761.0,0,t1_hhvq2jv,hhvq2jv,False,[deleted],t3_qegqd9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Placerville/comments/qegqd9/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Placerville/comments/qegqd9/deleted_by_user/hhvq2jv/,2,r/Placerville,0,2

"It depends on why you are moving. 

Family living? Amazing. You get comfort and convenience. Comfortably away from the bigger cities, but conveniently close enough to them to take advantage of what they offer. 

Schooling: Education is as good here as it is anywhere. In terms of athletics, that’s another question. 

Safety/homelessness: Crime is pretty dang low here! People mind their own business, but are also friendly. 

Drugs: I’d say it’s less widespread here than other places, and more so used under the radar by folks you wouldn’t expect. It’s nothing like Sacramento or The Bay. You don’t see it all over the streets, and it mostly likely won’t affect your daily quality of life. 

Insurance: This is something I’m more familiar with than most considering I’m a Realtor in El Dorado County and I get this question all the time. The answer is a little complicated so it’s best to have someone guide y out through this as you go because there’s no cookie cutter answer. Most areas in Pollock are destined to be with the CA Fair plan. Camino is hit or miss. Placerville has some reasonable areas, but forget it if you’re living in the Rescue area. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help here in the future!

">- How is it raising a family there?

Pretty decent, although it's a very conservative, not very diverse and mildly racist community. Hell, people were up in arms when the city counsil recently voted to remove the noose from our city seal. They started a campaign to remove these elected officials which, to my knowledge, never gained much traction. Our town nickname is Old Hangtown and nooses are all over. It seems to be an intentional deturrant to non-whites and zero care or concern is given to how offensive it is to them.

>- How are the schools?

El Dorado High was (is?) supposedly ranked very high in the nation. I'd gone to junior and high school here and I'd say it was pretty adequate.

>- How is the community? Are there lots of events?

Ha! No. You have the occasional event on main street but by and large this is a very boring place to live. We're like 45 mins from Sacramento though (as it sounds like you're aware) and there is always stuff going on down there.

>- How’s the homeless problem there?

Historically it's worse now than it's ever been. There are literal homeless camps here - the largest on the side of Broadway just outside of the ""main town"" with DOZENS of tents (easily 100+ people in this one camp alone). There are others scattered throughout the woods on the outskirts of town. I volunteer to feed the homeless and it's truly sad that the city ""good ol boys"" who own the vast majority of stuff here will not allow a homeless shelter to be built. Yes we have city's permission to, but if you're trying to rent/buy property and disclose your intentions, you get a quick ""oh hell no."" Sure, it's not as bad as Sacramento in overall magnitude but I'd wager to bet that per capita it's probably worse here. The number of homeless for our rather small population is astonishing to me.

>- Is there lots of drug users around?

Yes. This is a biproduct of an appalling local economy combined with nothing to do and few social services available. Meth and heroin abuse run rampant.

>One thing I can’t seem to get a clear answer on is how bad the insurance is there since it’s in a somewhat high risk fire area.

Many people are refused fire insurance and those who do have it have been grandfathered in after having it for a very long time. So if you can even get it, yes, it's mighty expensive I'm sure.

>If you live in town I would love to hear what you pay for insurance with fire protection.

We gave up trying to find it years ago so I cannot comment.

>Do you have a real fear of fires or is it mostly up the hill that’s in risk?

This will greatly depend on how wet this winter is. This summer it was terrifying to be very honest with you. I have ""go bags"" on the ready if that tells you anything. The further into the wilderness you live, the higher the stakes in this regard.

"Hello. 

I’ve been to Lincoln and it’s a great place (several years ago). It’s truly stunning here. 

Placerville is a great area but the zip code covers more than just the city of placerville. There is smaller towns around and lots of very different areas. 

Fire insurance can be expensive but it depends on where you buy and what you do to mitigate the issues on your property. Your risk will vary based on the conditions of the property you purchase. 

The community is incredible. The caldor fire really showed how much people care. 

People helped keep other homes safe, offered resources to those who were evacuated and helped take care of animals. 

The county sheriff offered his ranch up for people to keep their livestock. 

The county animal control came out and fed the barn/feral cats that couldn’t be evacuated. They also keep animals for you in their shelter until the evacuation orders were called off. 

People are still rescuing cats and dogs displaced by the fire, helping wildlife and making plans to clear some of the brush prior to the next fire season. 

While their are homeless we don’t see what Sacramento does. Due to the inclement weather they won’t survive up here the same way. Also fewer people to beg resources off of. The mentally ill and drug addicted are probably up here but you don’t see them like you do in Sacramento. 

I absolutely love it here. 



There are constant community events.

Downsides are if you want a diverse amount of cultural food you probably gotta head to Sacramento for supplies.

"I am. I didn't rush to get the vaccine when I was first able to, but when it came time to get it or potentially face scrutiny or worse at my job (IT at an engineering firm), I didn't really have a problem getting it. It actually wasn't that bad at all. Mildly sore arm for a day or two, but that's it. When I was working at a healthfood store in my early 20s, one of the people that worked there had a completely unvaccinated relative come back from India with measles. The CDC had to come out and contact trace us all. Kinda sucked worrying if I had contracted it, but that is a bit different than what we are dealing with now.

 I was/am a Bernie supporter, but after seeing the DNC do him dirty 2 election cycles in a row I got kinda bitter with them. I voted for Biden, but I'm not very happy with how that ticket is performing, and that's not to say I was happy with how Trump did. At least the media shut up a bit and we don't have a scandal of the week coming from that cheesy used car salesman. If there were an RNC candidate that seemed worthy I'd consider it. If Cheeto and someone like DeSantis were to run together next cycle, I certainly wouldn't vote that way.

I just think there were better candidates that were running. I'm non-party affiliated so I've no allegiance to either. 

Also the ""Let's go Brandon"" meme is pretty humorous to me because of how it started, and the fact that it did away with using the F word where children may be present. 

I just figure if you want the vaccine, get it (I don't judge anyone for that). If you don't, then don't (I don't judge anyone for that). I don't really see a need for it to be mandatory, and cut people off from goods/services/jobs that were available to those with the means (of which the socioeconomic factors are abundant) just 2 years ago. There's a reason the African American community is skeptical of this sort of thing, and I can see it becoming another form of segregation, of which I am wholeheartedly against.

I totally get why you don't believe me though.

*edit* Well to be perfectly honest I've edited it a number of times. But here's my addendum;  

I don't know that the down vote that I got came from this specific poster, it just seems odd to be down voted for open mindedness and inclusion. All of us down here in the bottom 99% are facing struggles that include keeping food on the table, and a stable place to live. There are those of us that were at the Occupy Wall street (For me in the Bay Area) protests saying we need to unite and take down these 1% F-wads and restore economical equality for all of us that keep the machine running. You've got to realize that the real fight isn't right vs left, its upper vs lower. Both political sides are looking to decimate us just to line their own pockets.

"There are plenty more off the beaten path worth looking at, but only a handful with lunch options. Picnicking is almost always welcome, though!

Near Pollock Pines, try Mirafores for excellent reds, Sierra Vista for a beautiful setting, an excellent fumé blanc, and a trippy tasting-in-a-bubble experience. When Smokey Ridge opens back up, they have a great summer rosé and a cute tasting that comes in test tubes with a little flower by it (they’re truly a local family business, they live across the street!). Lewis Grace also has a great Albariño and a nice rosé, and their tasting patio has plenty of shade and spots to sit in the grass right next to the vineyards.

My favorite part about wineries up here, besides the excellent wines, low tasting fees, and beautiful properties, are the people. I’ve randomly met owners while dining out, been invited to barrel taste by winemakers, am on first-name basis with folks in tasting rooms, got tons of off-menu pours, and even got advice to help me through hard times that had nothing to do with wine.

"Starfield is beautiful, has a decent lunch menu, and you can take a walk on their property afterwards with a glass of whatever you liked. The wines are decent, but nothing blows me away.

Nello Olivo has ok wines and an attached brewery/restaurant with ok food and good beer, but it’s not a vineyard tasting experience, it’s more like a tasting room.

Nearby, Myka Cellars has a nice kitchen with limited, albeit delicious options. Their wines are decent, but the winery that was there before, Jodar, was absolutely top notch.

If you bring your own lunch, Boeger and Lava Cap both have excellent wines and beautiful grounds to picnic at.

Near Shingle Springs, Ceilo has a charcuterie board, but no lunch options, however the whites/rosés are fantastic. Their reds are decent.


If you head to Plymouth, give Helwig a try; beautiful views, nice lunch restaurant, and good wines.

"Good catch. But after seeing my error I came up with 1.0967647059

I'm a first responder and the I base that statement on are Sacramento counties stats. The Crime statistics based on monthly totals. Usually those numbers are combined with other counties in the state to formulate the Crime statistics you'll see in 2021. 

It's also in the volume of calls, type of calls and increase in the number of calls pertaining to the situations I listed above. 

Last week alone a came across three families and four individuals who were newly homeless. They ALL stated shut downs as to why they lost their jobs.  Sure, I'm certain there were other factors involved. However, my point being.. it's causing a huge impact that is causing families a major hardship. 

I've also seen a huge increase in property crimes.  Seasonal,  maybe. Often around this time of year property crime take an upturn however this upturn has been going on now since June. 

You won't see good statistics posted until well after the year, but the trends are posted.

The first time I visited Placerville to go white water rafting I thought to myself this is where I'm going to grow old. That was 20 years ago. 

If you like doing things outdoors it's a hard place to beat. Whitewater rafting, mountain biking, Snowsports, fishing, off-roading, hiking, etc. Need a little nightlife? Sac is a half-hour away and Tahoe with its casinos is an hour away. And it's motorcycling heaven. You can spend days and days riding and never touch a 4 lane highway. And I'm gonna add that Yosemite is only 4 hours away.

Politically it's a conservative area, but it's also still CA.

It's kind of hot during the summer but usually 10 degrees cooler than nearby Sacramento. It only snows a couple of days a year and night time temps are almost never lower than 40 degrees.

I think if you have the chance to move here for the short term it's definitely worth trying it out to see how you like it.",t2_pkcun,anna_or_elsa,0,1597988317.0,0,t1_g2aryvb,g2aryvb,True,spankyassests,t3_idh9u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Placerville/comments/idh9u5/is_placerville_a_nice_place_to_move_tolive/,Is Placerville a nice place to move to/live?,/r/Placerville/comments/idh9u5/is_placerville_a_nice_place_to_move_tolive/g2aryvb/,3,r/Placerville,0,3
"As a younger person myself who grew up there, i can say that placerville has a lot of fun outdoor stuff, but but everything is a bit of a drive. people on here are playing down the racisim but it is for sure more racist than other places I've been in california. On multiple occasions that I'd been out with a black friend of mine we got racial slurs yelled at us. obviously thats a minority of people in the county but its not a place that punishes that type of behaviour. Even if it doesn't promote it. Along with gun nuts saying they are going to shoot protesters on facebook, it's not really a place for not being a white conservative.

Basically it's an alright place to live but there isnt much there unless you like the river and hiking. People in the town can ruin the experience but not everyone is like that, at the very least they tainted the place for me.

"I have lived all over the country in cities and beach communities from the east coast to the west coast and in the Rockies.  Placerville is a great place to live if you do not have to commute anywhere.  We lived there for 5 years within walking distance of town, but moved 15 minutes up the hill into the forest where it is often 10-15 degrees cooler and we get snow in the winter (which we love).  Placerville has a mix of restaurants and bars from standard redneck type joints to hipper new places opening up in recent years.  The annual Hangtown Music Festival is also pretty great, and I love the Farmers' Markets, Apple Hill Farm Markets, proximity to Tahoe, the El Dorado National Forest, and the American River.  The first year we lived there I saw the sun coming through storm clouds and lighting up Main Street on a winters day and commented to my wife that it the town looked like a Thomas Kincade painting.

"I’m comfortable enough in the doctors around Placerville that even without tests being available, they have been on the lookout for people showing even minor symptoms. Now that the testing can start we are likely to find someone with the virus. We can only hope that the sick have been following the guidelines that everyone has been given.

They did not choose correctly years ago, but had no idea how big a mistake it was going to be. That’s old news and doesn’t really matter. What does matter is that they are trying to make up for that now.

"Would it be wierd if I asked if you were married/long term relationship? And how old you are?
I'm married and nearly 27, no children. Also a tiny female lol, my home town we used to walk around a lot but it has since changed to having a lot of dangerous transients so we dont feel comfortable. I mean, it's not a dealbreaker for moving there, we just keep going for somewhere we can go for good walks at night.

I dunno where I saw it but at some point I saw the was like a Halloween ball of sorts? Is that there, or am I mistaken? 

What is it like for women around there? I'm not like, feminist or anything but this area I'm in now is just rather annoying with the ""women should stay at home and pop out kids"" mentality. Plus they're all trump followers and still get a kick from his sexist comments and actions. Lemmie tell ya, it's really awkward when a customer comes up saying all you're good for is a pussy grab. Sadly, it's just something I'm already used to.

To be honest I enjoy working customer service, especially when its tourist time. And placerville sounds like I'll get a lot of that no matter the time of year for the Tahoe travelers, no?

"Well, as far as night life goes, there are about 10 bars in Placerville. Main Street has a really good restaurant/bar called Public House where they do live music, there’s a lot of live music on Main Street. We have a library, it’s pretty decent. We’ve got a Walmart, Safeway, McDonald’s, Subway, Bean Barn (really good local coffee). We’re really close to Tahoe so there’s a lot to do there. Apple Hill is really fun during the fall if you like amazing apple cider and the scenery. I don’t feel safe walking around at night but I am a small female. Just down the hill is Cameron Park, with another Safeway, starbucks, Fork Lift (nugget grocery store). Best donuts in NorCal are in Cameron Park by the way. Sacramento is about 40mins - 1 hr away which has plenty of nightlife. It’s quiet up here, but there’s plenty to do. Drive 3 hours to Santa Cruz, Yosemite.

"Unless you're going to be making a good bit more money that you can parlay into a career elsewhere, I'd stay in tahoe. I moved from tahoe to placerville in 2010 and have since moved to sacramento. I'm just trying to find a way to move back to the mountains while making enough money. It was a nice change for a few years but it has nothing on the activities that tahoe has. I know the transient nature of tahoe can be a wear, but unless you're bringing an SO to settle down with there really isn't much happening in placerville.

"There is a facebook page dedicated to this. It's called the Mother load mystery booms. 

Most popular theory is the ammunitions depot in Nevada and the landscape terrain from there to here makes the booms loud here in El Dorado County.

Here's the page:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/290611704417119/

Glen White, a science instructor at Columbia College, published a report online in September 2014 explaining the mysterious loud noises were likely coming from a U.S. Army ammunition storage depot more than 100 miles away in western Nevada.
In recent days, White's report has gained attention from regional media organizations.
Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada says it destroys obsolete or excess munitions for the Department of Defense year-round, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Methods of disposal include blowing up explosives.
""They're using explosives to destroy explosives,"" White said. ""They want the explosion so big it actually vaporizes the metal.""
White determined the depot as the probable origin of the booms after a chance meeting last August with researchers from Southern Methodist University in Texas, who installed a sensor at Columbia College as part of a larger project to monitor nuclear and conventional bomb detonations in other parts of the world.
""This was just another tool to detect nuclear and other large bombs that someone might be testing far away,"" he said.
White found out SMU researchers have been working with the Hawthorne base for over a decade, using explosions at the site to help calibrate their sensors, which is one of the reasons they chose Columbia College as a location.
While the team was installing the sensor last summer, White said they actually heard and felt the booms themselves.
""They said it was so loud it shook the enclosure where their instruments are kept,"" he said.
Mother Lode residents have long questioned the origin of the so-called ""mystery booms"" sometimes heard throughout the region, but one local scientist believes he may have stumbled upon the explanation.
The booms have long intrigued White, a geologist. He set up a Facebook group in 2014 called ""Mother Lode Mystery Booms"" where residents can share their experiences.
White said he's heard many theories about the origin of the booms, with some blaming them on seismic activity, mining operations, top-secret military aircraft testing and even aliens.
""If it's secret military testing or secret mining, they're not doing a very good job at keeping it a secret,"" he said. ""These are awful big booms.""
White also dismissed the idea of the loud noises being caused by seismic activity or movements in tectonic plates, due to the lack of a coinciding earthquake.
Many on White's Facebook page have reported hearing the noises midday during the workweek, which coincides with the Hawthorne base's ammunition disposal schedule.
White said the noises could be traveling so far because of the energy waves from the explosions bouncing off atmospheric layers. They are typically heard during the summer months when conditions are just right, he added

"We play stuff like Dominion and Ticket To Ride, the ""Euro"" style games. But on Wednesday we usually end up playing things that are a little lighter, mostly because of time.

"The H.Art Lounge is a wine bar, so we usually see only people over the age of 21, but other than that we've had a big range of people of all ages. I'm not 100% certain of the rules for H.Art Lounge, they may not be able to allow anyone under 21 for legal reasons. I'm almost certain it says on the door, so you can stroll by and see before Wednesday if that's a problem.

The ages that usually come are pretty diverse I think. We have a lot of folks in the 20's and 30's range, but several of our regulars are in their 50's or up. It's really any age that's old enough to be there.",t2_9ac8n,dementomstie,0,1455475713.0,0,t1_czzsbfq,czzsbfq,False,thatonegirlfrom96,t3_45n32i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Placerville/comments/45n32i/looking_for_activities/,Looking for activities,/r/Placerville/comments/45n32i/looking_for_activities/czzsbfq/,1,r/Placerville,0,1
