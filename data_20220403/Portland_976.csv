"That is not what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm saying that if someone asks you to move back, you should politely do so. 

I‚Äôm also reminding people that disabled people are not an inconvenience to society nor disposable. I didn‚Äôt ask to get an autoimmune disease that affects my ability to breathe. I certainly don‚Äôt want to be put on a ventilator or go into a flare that prevents me from working for taking care of myself for a week or longer. I think the disabled at least deserve some compassion and awareness as everyone else gets to go back to normal. 

COVID is deadlier than the flu.

Also it has stressed our health care symptom that those of us who are chronically ill are not getting the same level of care we received before the pandemic. I was actually told By my Kaiser doc that couldn‚Äôt see a pulmonologist to help me get a diagnosis because all of them were too swamped with COVID cases. That delayed me getting treatment for my illness for another six months. I know people who can‚Äôt get the materials they need for their central line ports (needed for the infusions they have to get every week or so) and so they keep getting infections. Not only can those infections kill you on their own, but every time our immune systems are activated by any sort of infection, we often go into a flare. For someone with myasthenia gravis, these flares can mean the muscles that control our diaphragm stop working and we cannot breathe. That means we die or are put on a ventilator. 

So yeah‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think politely asking someone to step back would be inappropriate. I‚Äôm not asking all of society to mask forever. I‚Äôm reminding people that high risk immunocompromised and disabled people exist, matter, and deserve kindness.

"I'm surprised Zentner doesn't mention [the cause of the clockwise rotation](https://www.gsoc.org/field-trips/2018/5/11/ray-wells). The Juan de Fuca plate off our coast subducts obliquely, meaning that it's going north in addition to down. Under coastal Oregon, it's still coupled to the continental plate, so it tends to drag coastal Oregon northward a bit, causing a clockwise rotation centered near Pendleton and Le Grande. In addition to causing many of our hills and shallow faults, the northward component of the subduction also causes the northward bend in the Columbia River between Portland and Astoria. I'm also surprised he doesn't mention the fact that the direction of the Willamette River in Portland is controlled by the Portland Hills Fault and a parallel fault in inner SW Portland. 

FWIW, the Portland Hills Fault [likely continues](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/cfusion/qfault/show_report_AB_archive.cfm?fault_id=864&section_id=) up the Clackamas River.

"My opinions on the far Left were formed by watching hundreds of hours of their protests and speeches live streamed (until Antifa and the Red House Gang became so woke that they cancelled freedom of the press.) I do not watch TV.

It's not that Portlanders agree with letting this guy go, or with any of the far left bullshit, they don't and that's the point. Extreme leftist bullshit has had an out sized voice on twitter, on reddit, and in local government. Not that our government is made up of mostly useless irresponsible leftists (though there are a couple) but rather that our government felt the need to make gestures to these people, for funding and votes. Those gestures often took the form of, say, letting people go with no bail and no jail...

That's all changing now though. They're realizing that kissing the asses of the 'defund' movement is going to cost them all their jobs. People, the vast sweeping majority of people, want order. ""Black lives matter,"" is a sentence that couldn't be more true. BLM the organization, on the other hand, is a pile of grifter lies. Like Riot Ribs x1000. It's a sad state.

"I disagree.  People for Portland is a bipartisan group, one cofounder is a Democrat, the other is a Republican.   They want to end the inhumanity of street camping and do it with the urgency it deserves. I‚Äôm a Democrat and have made a small donation to them.  Here are their goals.  They seem very reasonable to me.

1. **End the Humanitarian Crisis on Our Streets**

Transition homeless Portlanders from inhumane, dangerous camps to safe, sanitary temporary housing solutions with access to mental health and addiction services

**2) Strengthen Accountability & Justice**

Require body cameras on all police to ensure transparency and accountability for those who enforce the law and those who break the law

**3) Reform & Reinvest in Public Safety**

Expand the Portland Street Response to engage those with mental health and addiction challenges; add more police for neighborhood patrols and to reduce rising violent crime

**4) Restore Cleanliness & Pride**

Initiate immediate government action for sustained citywide clean-up of garbage, dangerous waste, and graffiti

2) The severity of the crime is only one factor in bail decisions.  Today, we let murderers out on bail in many cases. The proposal is simply to eliminate money as a factor when considering bail.

If you previously would have been allowed bail with money, you're still allowed bail, you just don't have to pay anything.

If you were previously disallowed bail, you're still not allowed bail.

"We went on the market with our 2br 1ba detached condo that we bought in 2019 for 220, sold it for 325 this January. Unfortunately everything else in our range had also dramatically appreciated in value so the equity we gained was almost meaningless. We had a really hard time finding things that weren't total fucking teardowns, and when we did we would immediately get outbid, especially since our bid was marred by being contingent. We were becoming really concerned about the possibility that we would have to either rent or move back with family out of state. 

Luckily we found an awesome little 2br 2 ba with a 1/3 acre lot out near David Douglas that was being undersold and jumped on it right away. We put all of our chips in and our agent kicked some serious ass in getting us this house. Sometimes finding the right people is what makes all the difference.

"Our society has stigmatized mental illness so heavily, there still are many many people, especially over the age of 30 who will not admit to needing help or are simply just not self aware enough due to being shamed for crying, sharing that they feel depressed, etc by parents and peers. There are also social workers and therapists who are toxic, condescending, manipulative and are just in the professions to boost their own ego and do some seriously abusive shit to their patients. Psychiatric hospitals can be super traumatizing for some folks. Medications can cause pretty severe side effects that aren't worth taking.

 Others who do want treatment but are homeless have very little ability to engage in services due to not having transportation to appointments or internet or phone service, not being able to track what day and time it is, health insurance lapsing, not knowing where to pick up prescriptions, their prescriptions getting lost or stolen, and folks whose psychosis is so bad where they are extremely agitated/aggressive simply are barred from receiving treatment because no one wants to deal with them.

There are many reasons that people aren't able to get treatment, or flat out refuse it. The huge majority of the time it's not just simply because they don't want help, that's just the easiest reason to point at, but it's almost always more complex than that.

">why isn‚Äôt his mugshot available?

Because elected Oregon Democrats decided they didn't want the public to be able see booking photos. You can read about the legislation they passed to block the release of those photos here:

https://www.opb.org/article/2021/11/02/oregon-mugshot-law-booking-photos-released/

The real question is: *why* don't they want the public to see the photos?

And the answer to that is: because they don't want people like Andy Ngo to release the booking photos of antifa-types when they get arrested, that's why.

Here is some of the testimony that the Democratic reps used to justify passing this legislation. It explicitly cites Andy Ngo:

https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021R1/Downloads/PublicTestimonyDocument/9269

Here is an article in WW about the legislation and the motivations behind it. It also cites Andy Ngo:

https://www.wweek.com/news/state/2020/10/26/oregon-lawmakers-consider-making-it-a-crime-to-dox-someone-and-banning-law-enforcement-from-posting-mugshots/

"You are not understanding this correctly.  We are on a month to month lease and have been for years, we would not be breaking a lease by giving our notice and leaving.  In Portland, when a landlord terminates a lease for a Landlord Qualifying Reason (renovation is one of them), he is by law required to give the tenants 90 days notice and provide them with a designated amount of money for relocation assistance.  Our landlord is currently prepping our rental to sell, and the house needs extensive repairs.  Most people would say ""hey, we need access to the property for lengthy repairs, here is your notice, best of luck"" and pay the fees required by law.  Ours is playing a game of chicken with us by starting the renovations with no notice and hoping that we put in our notice first because living through a renovation is awful.

>Or, maybe you would still be upset no matter what because you might believe people should be entitled to relocation fees when an owner sells a house- but that's simply not how it works.

Actually, it is.  Once he accepts an offer on the house, he would have to give us 90 days notice and the relocation fee if the buyers intend to occupy the house.  If they intend to keep us on as tenants and raise the rent more than 10%, which would be highly likely if they kept us, they would be obligated to pay the relocation fees if we choose not to stay.",t2_15yxwp,Hellisia,0,1648954576.0,0,t1_i36ftp5,i36ftp5,False,Hellisia,t3_tuy3y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/tuy3y5/landlord_woes/,Landlord woes,/r/Portland/comments/tuy3y5/landlord_woes/i36ftp5/,0,r/Portland,0,0

"If I'm reading what you wrote correctly, you are upset with the condition the house has been in over the years, and you don't want to live in the house while it is being repaired and shown to potential buyers for a future sale. Because you are upset with those things, you believe the owner should do you a solid by terminating your lease early with a 90-day notice, instead of simply waiting for you to move out when the lease ends. 

  
Despite the insane real estate market in Portland, you believe no bank will finance a mortgage for a potential buyer, and you have not considered that the landlord could easily make the sale of the house be contingent on you and your boyfriend staying in the house until the lease is fulfilled- which is common. 

You stated that you brought up the topic of the 90-day landlord-issued notice with the owner, and you mentioned that he is fully aware that this would trigger relocation funds issued from him to you and your boyfriend. You said he didn't seem to even entertain that as a possibility, and countered by ""offering"" you and your boyfriend to break your lease penalty-free with a 30-day notice issued by you guys to him.

Did I get that right? I didn't bring up the security deposit issue because it's not really relevant. It's a crappy situation, but I think it's pretty common. I think you're finding yourself so upset because you have to deal with all this *and* the house is shitty. If it were a nice house with an extremely friendly landlord/owner, you might not be so upset. Or, maybe you would still be upset no matter what because you might believe people should be entitled to relocation fees when an owner sells a house- but that's simply not how it works.

"Gee, I wonder if you are my neighbor‚Ä¶except they just got new tenants after putting new lipstick in the interior to cover up the mold and rot, due to having waited 10 years too long to replace the roof. And even when they did, they didn‚Äôt fix the gutters. So the rainwater just flows down the house and leaks out the ceilings, but the renters don‚Äôt dare ask for it to be repaired for all the same reasons. 

The bathroom ceiling collapsed on the tenants, so they came in and replace the sheet rock but didn‚Äôt touch the damn broken down spout 5‚Äô away. 

When the basement floods and destroys the tenants items in the advertised basement storage, the landlord just tells them that they should know better than to store things on the basement floor. 

They hire the shadiest people do to work on the house, obviously no one is licensed or insured. They have some truly terrifying plumbing and venting work for the gas water heater. I hope the city actually inspected the structural changes they had to make when they got busted for having an illegal 3rd apartment in the attic (a 3rd ‚Äúapartment‚Äù that is accessed by walking *through* the 2nd apartment).

I keep hoping that they‚Äôll put a fresh coat of paint on it and sell the place, as it would be better for everyone involved (other than the buyers, perhaps).

"‚ÄúTo change unions, you have to submit a petition to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) signed by at least 30% of the members of your bargaining unit which may include workers in other plants. The NLRB will then hold an election. You have to get workers to sign a petition seeking to be represented by the new union; otherwise the only choice members will be given on the NLRB ballot will be between the old union or no union at all. To be successful, the new union will have to win the majority of the votes cast. The election results can then be challenged. The whole process can take months or even years.‚Äù

"Hi I work in a dispensary. I have recommendations for high tolerance users

1) RSO/FECO (2 names, 1 thing) it's an ethanol based extract with very high potency. Can be taken directly or mixed into home edibles. 

2) cheap edibles. Most large dispensaries now have a proprietary brand with 100mg thc for under $10 per pack. Nectar for example. 

3) tinctures. Sure there are droppers of oil (siskyou sungrown), but there's also flavored syrups some people prefer. The adabinol brand offers 1000mg thc syrup that can be had straight or mixed into a drink or something. Cannabull is another brand offering 150mg, 250mg, 500mg strength bottles the size of a 5hr energy drink. I recommend you do not buy Hush or other budget quality brands offering thc syrups.

"A couple points.

1. The best way to fight homelessness is to prevent homelessness. Getting someone off the street and integrated back into society is an incredibly expensive proposition (spoiler alert: a shelter bed ain't enough). We need to keep people from ever becoming homeless in the first place. Whether it's job training, drug and alcohol counseling, mental health services, or rental assistance for those facing housing insecurity, we need to attack it early and stop the cycle before it starts. People on this subreddit love to cite misleading statistics about how much money we're spending per homeless person while completely overlooking all the housing assistance for people that aren't actually on the street yet. Taking away that money is not a good thing.
2. This just feels like an attempt to ban homelessness while still holding on to the moral high ground. More shelter beds would be great but it's not the end all solution. Maybe we should let the experts decide how the money is spent instead of letting political operatives strong arm the city into a specific budget.",t2_bavbb,definitelymyrealname,1,1648933591.0,0,t1_i35gei0,i35gei0,True,3fjn3t,t3_tuaaox,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/tuaaox/ballot_measure_would_divert_homeless_funding_to/,Ballot measure would divert homeless funding to shelter beds,/r/Portland/comments/tuaaox/ballot_measure_would_divert_homeless_funding_to/i35gei0/,-2,r/Portland,0,-2

"From what I can research,  the 2 felonies or even the A Misdemeanor is the requirement for booking.   So he was booked.

Then the sheriff?  recognizance officer at the jail can set the bail at 0 before arraignment.  The article seems to explain this pretty well.  It is not the jail is full then release someone matrix,  it is the do you set bail before arraignment matrix?

Seems the presiding county court judge could tweak this.

The other extreme is putting an unpayable 1,000 bail on someone accused of stealing a back pack and holding them in Rykers for 6 months until they suicide or die.
