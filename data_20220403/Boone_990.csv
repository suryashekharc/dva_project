"I‚Äôve been living here for about 10 years and love the local restaurants so sorry if this list is too long! 

I spend most of my time downtown (on king street), there‚Äôs not as much happening as in Asheville but it‚Äôs cute and has some good stores to explore. You could check out the Jones house, they usually have art exhibits inside or on first fridays (the first Friday of the month) sometimes they will have live music out in the yard around 5. If you‚Äôre here on a Saturday you could check out the farmers market at horn in the west drive. When it comes to restaurants or other local coffee places, here are a few of my favorites: 

Our Daily Bread (sitting in the window area and watching downtown is fun here), COBO for sushi, casa rustica or Basils for pasta, and coyote kitchen for a little something different. Troy‚Äôs diner for a classic American burger with a retro atmosphere. The cardinal is also a good place for a burger or salad but is more modern and they have a good porch area in the back of the restaurant. For breakfast I would go to Melanies on king street or sunrise grill, or Troy‚Äôs diner. Melanies has the best atmosphere if you‚Äôre eating outside. Other really good king street adjacent restaurants are Proper, The local, and lost province for wood-fired pizza as well as a brewery. 

For coffee you could also check out Espresso News (on Howard street right next to king street) or the Local Lion.",t2_khaim6uq,eminem-is-here,0,1647098671.0,0,t1_i0dkncv,i0dkncv,True,Acciomidnight824,t3_tcb9ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/boone/comments/tcb9ae/5_year_anniversary_trip/,5 Year Anniversary Trip,/r/boone/comments/tcb9ae/5_year_anniversary_trip/i0dkncv/,4,r/boone,0,4
"\-Hike Rough Ridge. It's a pretty quick one-mile hike with absolutely the best views around. Pretty easy to get to, just take the BRP. Little strenuous, but super worth it and honestly not that bad.  


\-Hike Boone Fork Trail. Longer hike, 5 mile loop. Features a big ol' waterfall (one of the cascade-down-a-bunch-of-rocks type, though, so don't be expecting anything too dramatic. It's still hella fun to run around on the rocks though) and an absolutely gorgeous mountaintop meadow. Definitely tackle this one expecting to be exhausted at the end.  


\-Drive the BRP. Just grab some snacks, roll down the windows, and cruise. It's absolutely wonderful, especially if you go near sundown.  


\-Check out Blowing Rock. Lots of shopping and food.  


\-Come Back Shack. Best burgers around. Try the blackening seasoning on your burger, it'll change your life. Their shakes don't suck either.  


\-Art Crawl. Don't remember when it is but it's a specific date each month (first friday of the month or something like that). Lots of shops on King Street stay open late, have snacks and wine, etc, or have little events. I used to do tarot at Dancing Moon for them and it was always a blast.

&#x200B;

\-App Cookie Co. Best dang cookies around.

&#x200B;

\-Craft Beer. Handful of breweries in the area, Booneshine is my favorite but the others are solid too.

"Controversial take, but Boone is not the liberal oasis it thinks it is. I grew up there, lived there for 18 years and moved away. I moved back in 2016 and just recently moved away in December.

Boone loves to tout itself as this open minded place but they actively are working to only uplift the school and anyone adjacent to it. Any upward mobility is based solely in nepotism.

People often describe it as ‚Äúsafe‚Äù but what they truly mean is that it‚Äôs White. After the police shooting last year the town was overrun with state authorities offering no help, only creating a frothing, jingoistic fervor throughout the county.

"It‚Äôs a mixed bag.

I grew up in a rural area outside of Blowing Rock near the parkway for all of my early life. My family was composed of life long Democrats. Given my narrow view of the world at the time, I thought most people in Watauga County were like that. I was in for a big surprise when I turned into a conservative, religious nut and old enough to drive on my own. I found most religious conservatives at any Baptist church along with the Alliance church. I performed a lot of house calls for people that needed computer repair work, so I started noticing way more conservative Republicans in more poor, remote areas along with stupid wealthy people in their remote, million dollar vacation homes.

If you go in town near the ASU campus, you‚Äôll run into more liberal people.

"Yes.

Edit: I was replying to the tagline not the post. Tried and failed to be funny. 

Absolutely not. You would be in no danger. 


Boone is super liberal as far as businesses and bars go, mostly because all of those businesses are related to the college. 

There is a stark contrast with a ton of trump flags and other representations but I feel like that‚Äôs more because the liberal side is so visible here. Any time one side is ‚Äúloud‚Äù the other side raises its voice too. 

The result is a ton of bumper stickers yard flags etc showing what people think but honestly I rarely hear actual politics even being discussed in town. 


Assuming you are 37/38 based on the 85 at the end of your username. It can be hard to find your place here as a non local and non student. It‚Äôs doable for sure but tough in my experience as a 30 y/o. But if you‚Äôre active you should be able to find a group of some sort!

Also the housing market is super aggressive so if you don‚Äôt have build a new house money or good enough money to find a good house, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend buying here.

"It looks like off-campus college students might be affecting poverty rate calculations. On-campus students are excluded, but not necessarily off-campus students.

This piece attempts to remove off-campus college students from poverty figures and finds a dramatically lower poverty rate for several college towns, including Boone dropping from 60% poverty rate to 20%.

"College population is not figured in for the most part.

A huge reason why is that when you fill out the Census, there is a portion to fill out if you are not currently at your permanent residence (IE, at college for most of the year, but live somewhere else).

Both State surveys of the same, which specifically exclude students, as well as studies done by App State have both come up with similar numbers. We know the Census poverty data is correct.

But it is more than that, this data for Boone has been consistent for decades. It has one of the most disproportionate distributions of wealth of any municipality in the US, and one of the worst Gini coefficients.

"Gamekeeper- rustic and down to earth/accessible fine dining? I guess that could describe it. The emu steak and the wild game appetizer sampler is amazing. 

The Cardinal- local burger place with a nice twist of speciality ""wild game"" burgers and some great appetizers.

Proper- more like southern honestyle food. They have some amazing collard greens and pinto beans.

Cobo -sushi and cocktails

Lost Providence- wood-fired pizzas, appetizers, etc and a brewery.

Carolina Pizza Co is also really good and has some incredibly unique pizzas. My favorites are their taco pizza and their sum yung guy pizza. 

Eleven80 Eatery (in the mall)- place is underrated due to location. Good appetizers and sandwich style eats. Koren bbq pork tacos are the heat.

If you have the time or you live there, keep checking out local joints.

"Appalachian Management bought the shitty 1950s studio I had rented just before I moved in, and immediately tried to charge us for parking in violation of the original lease we'd signed with Holton (fortunately he backed down but I'm sure they started the next year).

Suspiciously they removed the carbon monoxide alarm that was in my apartment shortly after I moved in. They also sent people in to install a new bathroom fan without telling me. Near the end of the lease they were showing people the apartment constantly, often without telling me beforehand. And if I wasn't home when strangers were being brought into my apartment, they'd usually leave my lights on and the door unlocked.

That summer I was gone for 6 weeks for study abroad, and I specifically asked and left a note on the door saying I'd be gone and please don't leave my door unlocked. So when I came home, it of course was - with the lights on, I don't even know for how long.

For months I had to deal with construction right outside my door - he was installing water meters so that he could stop including water in rent starting the next year. I also reported black mold to them, of course they just painted over it.

"I'm always going for ""on the cheap"" when it comes to food. IMHO, China Wok is surprisingly good. Couldn't bring myself to try the ""China Buffet"" by the Boone Mall. Will let someone else speak to that.

Yea, Boone and Asheville.... ummmm, well, I've lived in Boone for 15 years and I wouldn't trade it for 5 Ashevilles -- with the exception of the major tourist times when they've got the roads basically blocked because they've got no idea where they're going or how to get there. And the clogging of the lane by the Starbucks for the folks who absolutely have to have their $9 cup of sweeteners and dairy products is enough to make me pull my hair out.

Apartments are going to be based on availability, of course. I've never rented, so I won't try to recommend rental agencies. If you look at Appalachian Classifieds on Facebook, you can ask questions there about rental companies and get some good responses. Of course, be prepared for the outpouring of hatred for rental prices in general. It's a college town and that drives the prices.

"Theres a new market shopping center with grocery, convience, movie theater, few restaurants, coffee shop, and a few retail stores. There is a boone mall which has a pretty slim selection of stores but has things like tj maxx for cheap basic clothing. Blowing rock has a tanger outlets with a couple of outlet stores that are good if you like the brands/retailers that are there. And then the area in boone where the walmart is has several restaurants(chinese, japanese, sports grill, coyote kitchen which is a eco friendly healthy Caribbean type restaurant) and then a couple retail stores. Boone is definitely a town for people who enjoy more outdoor orientated activities as theres not a whole lot going on as far as shopping and entertainment.

Definitely get a cinnamon roll with cream cheese frosting at Stick Boy. Other recommended places to eat -- Wild Craft Eatery, Vidalia, Proper, Coyote Kitchen, Black Cat and Stick Boy Kitchen (different location than Stick Boy Bakery). Don't bother with Macadoos or The Local (my opinion only). China Wok and Osaka are your best bets for Asian. Cobo for sushi. Mint for Indian. Clearly you'll learn a lot more living here than you'll see in a day, but there ya go. Also -- if you have never driven in snow and ice, just don't.

"üëã Hi so, correct on this being the Art of Living Retreat Center property. It used to be a yoga-based spiritual retreat center run by the same teacher who taught the Beatles meditation in the 60s-70s. The property remained empty for a while and is now run by The Art of Living Foundation. This is a highly transparently run org with a goal of providing workshops which teach breath techniques. The spa has been rated #1 in the country a couple years ago. You can think of the retreat center as similar to The Omega Institute up in the Berkshire Mountains - offering a place to learn wellness workshops. 

Art of Living Retreat Center does get targeted as being called a cult by well meaning people who have just heard stories and gossip. I assure you, there isn‚Äôt any truth to it. Yoga classes in the west are mainly relegated to gyms and yoga studios, where people often focus on bodily exercise. The retreat center here in Boone goes beyond, offering weekend workshops and retreats which provide healthy food, meditation to calm the mind from stress and a positive-mindset. The idea of weekend yoga retreats more than a one-hour yoga class is still new to many folks in our part of the world, hence there is that reaction. But if you look further into it, the techniques can really effectively reduce stress.

"I did Doordash for a year+ here in Boone. I have a regular job so was total gig option. It was great at first. Has gotten progressively worse. DD has changed base pay to like $2.50.

And always turn down $0 tip orders on principle. Now, DD will pause your dash if you turn down too many orders in a row in an effort to try to incentivize taking garbage orders. They also stack orders ‚Äî typically one ok order and one no-tip crap order. All in all, it‚Äôs just getting harder to cherry pick and make it profitable. You still can, you just have to hang tough.

"Anecdotal? Look at the data out of the UK or Cornell which are both highly vaccinated populations. Compare them to the data from SA which is a low vaccinated population. I recommend checking out Dr. John Campbell on YouTube for the raw data breakdowns and make your own conclusions instead of being spoonfed disinformation by demogogues. 

This politician is doing two things dishonestly: 1) Overhyping the ""danger"" of Omicron; mild symptoms include fatigue, sniffles, headache for the vast majority of patients. And 2) steelmanning the vaccines which the data shows this variant is evasive of spike protein-based immune response which is what the vaccines rely upon.

The data increasingly suggests that Omicron will displace the delta variant very soon, and likely become endemic, ending the pandemic as we know it and being added to the list of seasonal illnesses. It's within politicians' best interests to keep the pandemic going as long as possible but it's already the beginning of the end.

"Knowing your black letter law is good but doesn‚Äôt make a lawyer. 

Poker isn‚Äôt a game of chance, but of skill which exempts it from this. That‚Äôs why you can find poker (and slot) machines that you put money in and can make money from. These are common in gas stations and dive bars across NC. 

In the case for slots they had to add the option to move a column of the slot machine one space up or one space down, giving it a ‚Äúskill‚Äù component. 

In holdem you can argue you pick the 3 of the cards from the flop/turn/river to make the best hand, meaning there is decision, therefore skill. There are arguments for skill in other forms of poker as well.

It is legal to have poker games for money as long as a third party isn‚Äôt making money from it (typically in the form of a rake).

"I agree.  Air service comes at a cost.  Part of the appeal of Boone is that it is quiet.  The bigger an airport gets the louder it gets. Though Boone is no secret, it‚Äôs out of the way enough such that the type of people who live in towns to pose in the right place with the right people wearing the right clothes and driving the right vehicle normally don‚Äôt view it as worth it. Well, except for a day trip, or they go to Blowing Rock. I would encourage you to keep it that way.

I‚Äôm from the Rocky Mountain west which is loaded with ski towns full of posers like I described. Most of the famous ones have an airport adjacent to or about 30 minutes from town. Posers who live in those places need an airport. It‚Äôs part of the image. I currently live in the suburbs of a large city about 7 miles from a busy regional airport which makes huge amounts of noise day and night. During fire season they launch tanker aircraft from it, and, because they are loaded up full of fire retardant or water, they gain altitude slowly and you hear hear them. It‚Äôs necessary, but it‚Äôs loud. About 20 miles away is a large international airport which also produces a lot of noise despite the distance.  There are ways to have a nice, economically well developed community without air service. Boone a quiet friendly place. ‚ÄúImproved,‚Äù air service would ruin it in my opinion.",t2_a5078s8o,ErrorZealousideal532,0,1639155176.0,0,t1_ho083lu,ho083lu,False,TheBigYellowOne,t3_rcs1ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/boone/comments/rcs1ge/wouldnt_it_be_awesome_to_have_an_air_bus_type_of/,Wouldn‚Äôt it be awesome to have an air bus type of thing fly out of the Boone Airport?,/r/boone/comments/rcs1ge/wouldnt_it_be_awesome_to_have_an_air_bus_type_of/ho083lu/,2,r/boone,0,2

"Check out the local rental agencies for house rentals ‚Äî we used Hidden Creek Management for two years to rent a pretty nice house before we could buy‚Ä¶ we dodged the covid bullet tho and bought a couple years before the pandemic. The rental market resets in August when students move in, but things start filling up quickly in the Spring. I‚Äôd say ask the agencies what will be becoming available and plan a trip to visit and do some walk through and see the areas around March/April.  I wouldn‚Äôt bother with apartments if you can afford it. Like others have said, they‚Äôre almost exclusively student housing and overpriced accordingly.

The housing market is insane right now, but it‚Äôs that way everywhere. The house we bought for 325k in 2018 is worth 550k now, and I know first hand the homes in our neighborhood are selling like hot cakes for 20% over asking. We‚Äôd sell if we had anywhere else to go lol. There are several areas outside Boone that are basically still Boone: deep gap, meat camp,  blowing rock, foscoe, valle crucis, Zionville. Don‚Äôt rule them out because they aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúBoone‚Äù. 

If you are able to find a place, I think the city would satisfy your other preferences. It‚Äôs a small city for sure, and population drops abut like 1/3 when school is out (which we definitely consider a good thing).

"The Mysterium Escape Room on King St comes to mind. Elwood's Hatchet House, too!

There are also hiking trails on campus, up above the football stadium. You can start on the stairs that go up behind Bowie and Eggers, and then there's another trail that goes up the mountain past Greenwood Lot. 

Another trail near campus that's kind of cool: from Rivers St (near the Ale House/Cafe Portofino), there's a little house that's owned by the town of Boone (150 Clay House Dr). The trail goes up the hill behind the house, and it leads to a tree that's recognized as being the largest of its species (poplar? I think?) in the area. It's fenced off and there's a plaque and everything. It's probably only a quarter mile or so, but it's pretty steep.

I‚Äôve seen substantially more black widows - but only when we have a super warm year. Black widows are actually shit and will chase you. I usually try to safely relocate them to hell.

Also please note I‚Äôm super super outdoorsy so I‚Äôm out in their habitat constantly.

"Can vouch for Booneshine. As mentioned by another commenter, their menu does lean more towards apps/small plates but I just get a bunch of those for my meal. Lots of outdoor seating and they have live music some nights!

Lost Provence is another good brewery/restaurant; they do specialty pizza as well as usual bar fare. They also do charcuterie but I haven‚Äôt tried that yet. Heads up, they don‚Äôt do reservations and it can get crowded on the weekends.

A ‚ÄúBoone Staple‚Äù is Dan‚Äôl Boone Inn. Some people think it‚Äôs overrated but imo it‚Äôs delicious. It‚Äôs a family-style all-you-can-eat restaurant, which if you wanna spend $20 to do that, go ahead, BUT a less commonly known secret is that they do dinner takeout boxes. For $12 (iirc), you get two pieces of fried chicken, two sides, two ham biscuits, a plain biscuit, and a small serving of dessert. I have never eaten inside DBI and just get that dinner box and it‚Äôs plenty to eat.

My fave hiking trails around Boone, listed from Easiest to Moderate: Beacon Heights, Cascades Trail, Boone Fork at Julian Price, Flat Top Mountain trail at Moses Cone, Green Knob loop at Julian Price, Elk Knob summit trail. I do recommend Rough Ridge, but parking for that trail can get crazy on the weekends and there are other trails along the parkway that don‚Äôt get as crowded and are just as nice.",t2_qu9yd,MacaroniMacarons,0,1632535864.0,0,t1_he65aqf,he65aqf,True,Woahbikes,t3_pure4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/boone/comments/pure4q/i_will_be_in_town_next_week/,I will be in Town Next Week!!!,/r/boone/comments/pure4q/i_will_be_in_town_next_week/he65aqf/,1,r/boone,0,1

"You're very welcome.

I mention the proof of vaccination because not a lot of people are just carrying that around with them.

Boone is a super tiny college town, so you'll find plenty of places for drinks - there are a couple of breweries here.

Traffic will suck since classes are in session and the tourists are here for fall colors. Speed limit town-wide is 35, and the cops rarely have more to do than give out speeding tickets, so don't haul ass through town.

No matter where you go, though, parking will be a problem, so try to limit the amount of vehicles you use around town.

Also, if you don't have Verizon as your cell service provider, you'll lose service often. It's basically the only one that works up here in the mountains.",t2_8gklrvxt,michelle_thetvaddict,0,1632517683.0,0,t1_he5152b,he5152b,False,Woahbikes,t3_pure4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/boone/comments/pure4q/i_will_be_in_town_next_week/,I will be in Town Next Week!!!,/r/boone/comments/pure4q/i_will_be_in_town_next_week/he5152b/,1,r/boone,0,1

"General Boone info: 

* Mask mandates inside any public place in Boone town limits
* Fall/Winter has already arrived - it was 41\* when I woke up this morning - it's supposed to be warmer than that this weekend and absolutely beautiful.
* Some places are requiring proof of vaccination before letting you in

Boone's ""downtown"" is like a 1/4 mile of King St. Parking is a pain in the ass, but if it's the weekend, you can park on App State campus without any problem.

The Cardinal has the best burgers in town (in my opinion), but they are one of the places requiring proof of vaccination (whether you sit inside or outside).

Boonshine is super awesome - tons of outside seating and good inside seating - right next to a nice park. I wouldn't depend on them if you're wanting to eat, though. They have snack food, but no meals.

Best pizza in town (in my opinion) is Carolina Pizza Company.

The Local has great food and drinks and is downtown so very close to lots of other great places.",t2_8gklrvxt,michelle_thetvaddict,0,1632516125.0,0,t1_he4xf2z,he4xf2z,True,Woahbikes,t3_pure4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/boone/comments/pure4q/i_will_be_in_town_next_week/,I will be in Town Next Week!!!,/r/boone/comments/pure4q/i_will_be_in_town_next_week/he4xf2z/,6,r/boone,0,6

Animal hospital of Boone is an excellent emergency vet but of course emergencies are pricey. They have saved my dog‚Äôs life and my moms dog as well.

"You may have a hard time getting an appt on the day of in Boone, as such, I would recommend getting up and starting to call around at 7 or 8am when they open.  I live in Boone and had to take my cat to emergency vet Sat night for same thing.  They tried calling in meds for him because he is belligerent and has to be sedated but the meds did not help and he was miserable by Sat night.  The total bill was $600 which included visit fee, X-ray, bloodwork, needle urine sample, sedation and his meds.  If you can‚Äôt get him in and have to go emergency route, opt to have them start by checking urine, likely the cheapest way and if infected, they know UTI and how to treat.  Also, as a long time cat owner, always be sure they can still pass urine as a blockage can quickly become fatal, esp for males.  If I can provide further info, please let me know, happy to help and hope he/she is better soon!",t2_5tiztywk,rayanneroche,0,1631580610.0,0,t1_hcrfzbq,hcrfzbq,True,problyfake,t3_pns2w0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boone/comments/pns2w0/i_need_vet_recommendations_for_the_morning/,I need vet recommendations for the morning.,/r/boone/comments/pns2w0/i_need_vet_recommendations_for_the_morning/hcrfzbq/,4,r/boone,0,4
