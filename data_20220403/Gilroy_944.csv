"I was about to recommend this nice little place.  My wife's mother would stay here.  It's quite decent.  She always had good things to say about it.

Gilroy Gardens is best for little kids.  It has its charm but don't expect Disneyland.

Another poster mentioned the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and yeah: that's wonderful.  If you're a foodie, Haute Enchilada in Moss Landing is about halfway there and is amazing.  (NOT the Whole Enchilada, a half-block away.)  Reservations are needed.  The Fish Hopper on the water in the Monterey cannery district is great too.  Foodies will also find plenty to like in Gilroy.  Garlic City Cafe is wonderful and Old City Hall has something for everyone in a nifty old building, and there are many others.

Then there's Santa Cruz with its boardwalk area and nice beaches, and Great America another 30 minutes north in Santa Clara.  And for grown-ups, wine tasting galore right here-- this is California's oldest wine region.",t2_5nr0p3jo,scjcs,0,1648186302.0,0,t1_i2156ib,i2156ib,False,Detronyx,t3_tn6vkj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/tn6vkj/where_to_stay_hotels/,Where to stay?

Even more local to Gilroy is the trails around Christmas Hill Park and just that park in general is awesome with a lot of amenities and easy access.

"In terms of?

Food:

* BBQ152 in Gilroy - great (depends on the day) bbq imo, especially compared to the shit offerings SJ/SC offer. Prob not a hidden gem locally as it’s pretty well known, but def a hidden gem in the Santa Clara county as a whole. Rib sandwich w/ onions and slaw is my fav. 
* Cozy Cup Cafe in Hollister - Tied for my personal favorite breakfast spot. Recommend the SF Joe or basically any of their scrambles. Super delicious potato’s, huge portions, great prices, lovely atmosphere. 
* Beach St. Cafe in Watsonville - my other personal favorite bfast spot. Rec the Meat Lovers scramble. Portions are a little smaller but any of the plates are top notch. Both these places are vastly, vastly superior to OD’s, sorry Gilroy peeps but that place is donkey balls. 
* Calavera Coffee in Hollister - Great coffee shop serving artisan made coffees. Also sells lots of other stuff such as store merch, Vinyls, and packaged to go coffees. Very cool shop, workers are super cool, interior space is designed very well. Try their signature drink called The Villian if you ever go. 
* Mangias Italian Restaurant in Hollister - I’ve tried a lot of Italian cuisine in the Tri county area, this spot is probably my favorite. Great pasta and other dishes, my favorite has to be their Penne Bolognese. Owner is always there working and is super helpful if you have any questions. 
* Inaka in San Juan Bautista - new sushi spot in SJB. Prob the best sushi in the MH/Gilroy/Hollister/Watsonville area imo. A fairly traditional Japanese menu with some fun rolls mixed in. Fish quality is prob the best in area. Chefs Sashimi special mix is prob the highlight and is a great price considering you get a buttload of fish to sample on

Places

* Byrne-Milliron Forest in Watsonville - Some great options for if you want to spend time in nature but are somehow limited time. Also features a hidden 1000yr old 250 foot tall redwood deep into the park. 
* Pinnacles National Park - listing this here as I think this park is MASSIVELY underrated considering it’s such a close distance to us Tri County folk.  The High Peaks trail is a very rewarding trail both physically and visually. 
* Fremont Peak State Park in San Juan Bautista - a fairly small park that packs such a cool view. Climbing to the peak via the main trailhead is rewarding but if you want to have extra fun you can reach the peak via the West face for a more hands on “approach”, don’t get it twisted though it’s nothing too crazy. At the top you’ll find the best view of the Tri County area. On a clear day you’ll be able to see SC, Salinas, Monterey, Gilroy, and Hollister at the very top. WARNING AS THIS NEXT PART MAY GET YOU IN TROUBLE.  Along the west face of the park you can however climb over a fence and explore more towards the west but be warned you are trespassing on private property. Haven’t seen or heard of anyone getting in trouble but YMMV. Anyways if you continue going west you’ll climb along a “knifes edge” of rocks but again nothing crazy but definitely fun. The highlight of this extra side trip is a fairly decently sized cave area. Depth unknown to me, but judging from what I’ve seen it goes deeeep.

Beer

* Sante Adairius Rustic Ales (SARA) in Capitola - this is a craft beer cult favorite. One of the best breweries in the entire nation. Don’t want to spoil too much but this place is a must try 1000%.",t2_8635g,fpsdr0p,0,1646732779.0,0,t1_hztipg8,hztipg8,True,benjlz,t3_t9b9mq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/t9b9mq/hidden_gems/,Hidden gems,/r/Gilroy/comments/t9b9mq/hidden_gems/hztipg8/,11,r/Gilroy,0,11

"I grew up going to church w/Jeff at South Valley Community Church in Gilroy, CA. I was looking for a new job in 2020 and interviewed with Jeff at his insurance company as a receptionist/clerk. During the interview he asked me a question that I had never been asked before during an interview. He asked if I had ever taken a personality test (like the Myers Briggs). I told him that I had when I was a teenager and that I didn't remember all the letter that I had gotten but I do remember that I had gotten I (for introvert) and N (iNtuitive) I couldn't remember the 3rd letter but the last letter was a J (Judging or Justice). 

I didn't get the job. He hired someone else and within one month the person he hired quit. It always seemed to me very odd that he would ask that question. However... when I had heard of what he had done it made sense. 

If you study personalities like he had, (why would you ask that question other wise?) It was a sneaky way of trying to figure out, ""will that person talk if I try something""?

When I heard what he was arrested for, it hit me like a ton of bricks. It all made sense. I knew he asked me that question for a reason. And it always just boggled my mind and I would have to pass by his office everyday on my way to work and I would always think, ""what a weird question."" I'm 41 years old and I have had my share of interviews and I've never been asked that question before. 

I thank God I didn't get that job.",t2_djik9a3e,Harley_Kole,0,1644811047.0,0,t1_hwvavpy,hwvavpy,True,lklein94,t3_okazp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/okazp7/gilroy_dispatch_jeffrey_guenther_found_guilty_of/,Gilroy Dispatch: Jeffrey Guenther found guilty of sexual assaults,/r/Gilroy/comments/okazp7/gilroy_dispatch_jeffrey_guenther_found_guilty_of/hwvavpy/,1,r/Gilroy,0,1

"The bottom line is until they actually dig up the ground and lay down the actual fiber infrastructure what they are claiming to be fiber is partial at best, meaning they have fiber in their building and potentially down to the street, where it is connected to coax or ""broadband"" which is the copper twisted pair or DSL. So when you look at it, who ever has the biggest pipe ""copper wire"" which IS Spectrum, Comcast and who ever else is sending data over those lines by way of renting leasing ""piggy backing"" on whom ever actually owns those coax lines. Now AT&T and a host of others are still using the good old fashioned phone lines that have been in place for decades or even longer and simply because they connect fiber to those phone line/twisted pair/DSL etc. etc. they somehow are allowed to claim ""FIBER"" which is essentially glass wire. Then there are those who have a monopoly in the rural areas who use antennas of sorts to broadcast immorally expensive wifi internet from customer to customer and are only capable of providing a minimal Mbps to their over charged captured customers like those yahoos over at garlic dot con (I left out the ""M"" on purpose. Heh). I have found Comcast to be the most reliable as well as the fastest and believe it or not, I really can't believe i'm saying this , some of THEE BEST Customer service I have experienced in a long time from a big company like that. And forgive me for saying this but many of the customer service agents don't speak with an accent other than those you would encounter here in the good ol' US of A. This one woman had the cutest southern draw etc. etc. you get my point. This is not to say Comcast is completely absent from that but still hands down THEE BEST Customer Service around.

Christopher might not be doing anything wrong as far as law goes yet it's pretty clear that he doesn't care about fairness of supply chain where they are buying from as long as they get lowest price. This is where most problems start - being indifferent towards anything that happens lower on the supply chain. The fact that Harmoni is one of largest players in the market and conveniently is not hit by dumping taxes while everyone else does - doesn't seem right. And whole prisoners labor thing and how they managed to escape allegations on this question.

Few years late but just finished watching series. That couple was the the least likeable people in whole series. Typically people who clearly know that they are on the wrong just don't show up for comments. Others might find them selves on the unlikable side but simply follow what they believe in. But these two clearly fabricated up whole tale. If they would have had truly found them selves in in-fighting of mega corporations that they didn't want to take part in as they said it to be - instead of changing alliances they would have had simply dropped out of the whole thing. Instead what they did was clearly changing alliance with a side that came in with attractive cash offer. The irony of their tale is how they accepted cash offering to fabricate a story that they got involved in pay-to-play scheme.,t2_49ryqqv6,SnooHedgehogs7477,0,1641156305.0,0,t1_hqzbjgu,hqzbjgu,False,brianozi,t3_7rclmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/7rclmw/netflix_documentary_rotten_garlic_mafia_or_not/,"Netflix documentary ""Rotten"" Garlic Mafia or Not?",/r/Gilroy/comments/7rclmw/netflix_documentary_rotten_garlic_mafia_or_not/hqzbjgu/,1,r/Gilroy,0,1

"I have Frontier Fiber now just over 60 days. I went with their gig service for 69.99 after auto pay. Price guaranteed for two years.  I live at Mantelli / Hirasaki.

The speeds are great.   But be warned the support service from Frontier is terrible.   I had an outage and it took six days before service was restored.  When we called to report outage they did not have a tech available for six days latter.  When the tech arrived he found someone had disconnect our service at their hub near Longmeadow. Took him all of five minutes to restore service.  Seems like some other tech didn't know what they were doing and disconnected our service.  Apparently Frontier doesn't have fiber service techs in area, hence the delays in getting someone out.

"Cool. I just got off the phone with Frontier. They claim their Gilroy fiber slots are ""85% full today"", and one must purchase a ""Reservation Account"" or be a current customer to guarantee a slot.

Here's their somewhat-shady pitch right now to be put into a ""Top Priority Account"" for fiber install. Call their number at 1-877-266-2897, and:

1. Sign up for a ""Reservation Account"" for their 3mbps DSL service.
2. Schedule an install date. This involves things like giving them your full name, date of birth, and social security number for a soft-pull on credit. I asked if I could just pay cash or give them a credit card and they refused. Credit check required.
3. They guarantee a fiber install date within 60 days (in my area) from the initial call (e.g. ""today""). So for me calling on November 3, that means that if I don't have fiber after January 3, I might cancel unless fiber is really super close to being done.  So I'd be out around a hundred sixty bucks for trying this experiment... worth the risk to me. 
4. When the tech calls to work out the details of the DSL install, inform them that it's a Reservation Account for a Fiber Install. The tech may reschedule as a result, or may proceed with the DSL install.
5. The fiber install will occur at no charge within that 60 day period of my call.

It should be good for both gigabit and 500 megabit service. The installation fee is $85, and the first month's service is $37.99. So the first bill Net 30 Days after install is $117.99 including installation and activation, and $37.99 thereafter for the 3mbit service. Once I upgrade it to gigabit fiber, it's $74.99 per month for 36 months: a $2,700.00 commitment with an early termination fee.

I have a decent edge router, so I'll just set up the slow DSL service as a fallback for my faster Charter service temporarily while the fiber is being brought up.

Hopefully this all works out as they say :D",t2_jh5lk,txgsync,0,1635972102.0,0,t1_hj73oz9,hj73oz9,False,[deleted],t3_qm1txm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/qm1txm/does_gilroy_have_high_upload_speed_internet/,Does Gilroy have high upload speed internet?,/r/Gilroy/comments/qm1txm/does_gilroy_have_high_upload_speed_internet/hj73oz9/,3,r/Gilroy,0,3

"*bush rafting— I meant bushcrafting. But yeah Fashion and interior designing huh?Cool cool cool who’s your favorite fashion designer/ why? Or what kind of interior styles do you like?— I took a costume designing class recently and one of my biggest takeaways was how important sketching consistently to work in the muscle memory and refine how to model 3D forms onto paper is for creative designing. There are loads of tutorials on yourube where you can search for excercise a and practices and I would encourage you to rotate a daily excercise into a sketchbook to flesh out some thoughts. It’s very pleasing when designers can share a snippet of their creative journey visually! 

On a side note, if you and a parent are generally available this Saturday 10/23 I’m not sure what time (you may want to call and check about the event details) I know that the Neon Exchange on Monterey and 7th ish area is hosting some mixer for what I think is a Santa Clara county arts non profit that is aiming to get more in touch with the gilroy community to figure out ways on how to get funding to art programs in gilroy. I heard about it in a town hall meeting and it sounds like a great place for you to check out a beautifully designed shared workspace incubator, mingle with civic leaders and creative folk in your city, and potentially learn of ways you could get involved in things that would satisfy your boredom.... maybe...

The goal is to promote a better understanding and partnership between the department and the community.  Participants will meet police personnel and experience some of their duties.

During the 14 weeks, participants will receive information in a variety of interesting topics. There will be a mixture of lectures, power point presentations, a tour, demonstrations and hands on activities in a safe and controlled environment. The weekly sessions are not intended to train participants to be law enforcement professionals, but rather produce more informed citizens. Each session will be taught by police personnel. Topics vary each week.

Some of the topics included are:

    Patrol Operations
    Communications

"Human interest stories often grab me.

* The legacy of the Gilroy Garlic Festival massacre.
* Commercial real estate values and sales amidst the pandemic.
* Growth statistics contrasted with mass transit and road capacity.
* The impact of the new ""no single family zoning allowed"" California law on SC County.
* Progress on the high-speed rail line that's supposed to come through Gilroy with a stop here.
* Old businesses that have shuttered and new ones that have opened in the area.
* The impact of the big new housing complex on the Gilroy economy.
* Upcoming commercial projects in the Glen Loma Ranch subdivision.
* Fire risks in the area.
* Recent updates to the Levee Trail and opening dates for new sections.
* Increase of murals throughout the city and who the artists are.
* The return of a live music scene to the city, suspended since the Garlic Festival Massacre.
* Impact of the drought on area farmers & garlic crops.
* State of the Anderson Dam seismic retrofit: what problems lie ahead, scheduling challenges, that kind of thing.
* Impact of the empty Uvas reservoir on local wildlife and recreation.
* The expensive Levee retrofit and its apparent ineffectiveness at preventing burrowing rodents from damaging the trail. Does this increase the risk of flooding?
* Impact of the increasing amount of rooftop solar in the area.
* Bridging the divide between the ""Old Gilroy"" -- largely agricultural -- and growing bedroom-community Bay Area tech worker communities.
* Crime rates at the Outlet Malls.
* Planned changes to the local hospital.
* Fifth Street Coffee holding its own despite the city being overrun by 7 Starbucks and First Street Coffee's closure.
* Chronic understaffing problems at local restaurants including Pineapple Village.
* Impact of the 55% chance of La Nina on Gilroy & the Santa Clara Valley.
* The growing Gilroy skateboarding scene.
* What is being done about Friday night & Sunday night traffic jams on the 101.
* The effect of the pandemic on Caltrain to Gilroy, and what the typical commute is like now.
* The rise of contactless payment with retailers.
* Gilroy's unique tectonic risks in the event of another earthquake at the scale of Loma Prieta... and how prepared (or unprepared) residents are when the next big one hits.
* Gilroy high school pool closure and expected reopening schedule.
* The lack of a public pool in the town.
* Bustling business at charming Sandy's Cafe, O.D.'s cafe, and Black Bear Diner: lines out the door on Saturday & Sunday mornings.

I don't think the smell makes me nostalgic or anything though no.

"No, and yes.  

I grew up in Gilroy in the 1980’s and left for college in the mid 1990’s.  If you remember the chiropractor at first and Carmel, that was my mom.  

The garlic smell thing is sort of true.  

While Steinbeck said that Gilroy is the only place in the world where you can marinate a steak just by hanging it out on the line - there are caveats. 

First - it isn’t the smell you associate with cooking garlic.  It is garlic in the fields - or being harvested and processed.  It has a much more earthy smell.  

And it isn’t year round.  It happens at a few times of year - and is noticeable - but I never considered it overpowering or unpleasant.  It is more like the smell of your own home after you come back from vacation.  Noticeable but you go nose blind to it quickly.  

I visited in the early 2000’s and remember smelling it.  

I always thought the tomato canneries were much more pungent and objectionable.  

And yes - I do find the earthy smell of growing / harvesting garlic to be nostalgic.  I live in the flyovers now and there is a city an hour or so away that is trying to get a garlic festival going.  I have been a few times - but it is always a disappointment.  They can’t make a decent pepper steak or scampi to save their lives.  Mostly just a craft fair with a very lose garlic theme.

We've actually found Gilroy to be a decent foodie's mecca, especially when combined with the occasional jaunt to Ladera Grill just down the street in Morgan Hill.  We moved here from Alamaden, and the restaurant selection is much, much broader and generally better.

Also, for a quick but excellent burger, try the new Brew City Grill, near West Side Grill and same family ownership, so you know the quality will be excellent.  Great for dine-in/patio dining or take-out, and they have a drive-through.

Pinnochio's for pizza, of course.  Corner of Welburn and Church.

Ginger Cafe for Chinese food.  Mmm.

Annnnd don't forget all our great wineries for wine-tasting, picnicking and sometimes music events (for example, at our favorite, Sarah's Winery).  Some (like Sarah's) offer light snacks of their own.",t2_5nr0p3jo,scjcs,0,1621624040.0,0,t1_gyz4prc,gyz4prc,False,cwx149,t3_nhemwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/nhemwm/restaurants/,Restaurants,/r/Gilroy/comments/nhemwm/restaurants/gyz4prc/,2,r/Gilroy,0,2

"Garlic City Cafe - has an amazing menu. Be patient as the chefs are pushing out plates as fast as possible but boy is it worth the wait. The seating/dining isn't the best but if you're looking for good food, you won't be disappointed.

West Side Grill - really good food and a fair dining experience. 

Cielito Lindo - is really good Mexican food.

BBQ 152 - good BBQ and a nice outdoor seating arrangement.

Milias Restaurant - Good food, music on Thursday nights (I think...if COVID isn't being too restrictive.) 

Ninja Sushi & Sushi Omakase - go to sushi places depending on how close you are to either.

Old City Hall - decent food, better patio. Kareoke on Friday and Saturday nights.

"If you’re looking for mountain bike trails check out Henry Coe. The trails at Harvey bear in San Martin connect with the trails at the Mendoza entrance in Gilroy. There are also a bunch of longer steeper trails connected to hunting hallow and around the Gilroy hot springs. 

Road routes are great too. I like taking the levee bike path to the end at 152 then crossing over to burchell road. Ride burchell to Watsonville road and you can go either left and go up redwood retreat or go right and take watsonville road as far as you want. Watsonville to Day Road is a good loop, you can go as far as Santa Theresa and loop back, or you can go left and go on uvas if you’re looking for a longer ride.

"We came from Ohio! We have young children as well. Dependent on your finances:

* Oakland Zoo - it isn't as good as the Columbus Zoo, but it's better than Happy Hollow, Happy Hollow Zoo is a waste of money to be honest.
* Monterey Bay Aquarium - Best aquarium, on par with the Georgia aquarium.
* Gilroy Gardens - Great for youngsters (<6 years old), after 6, you can still take them but the excitement dwindles.
* Rock 'n Jump is a great trampoline jumping area - bring the kids there for two hours and they'll be worn out by the time you leave.
* The Chuck e Cheese in San Jose is actually great and doesn't smell like stinky feet like literally every single other one. I believe it's the first one, ever, and it's jam-packed, always tons of people there.
* Santa Cruz boardwalk - there is a similar thing to Dave and Busters there, there's tons of things you'd associate with a themepark there like bumper cars, roller coasters, various other rides, similar to Gilroy Gardens but a little more pricey (I have three kids and usually spend \~60$ each trip, $20 on each generally).
* Uvas Canyon is a short trip and an amazing place - you need reservations but there's tons of little waterfalls and a really cool creek for the kids to run around in and hike around. We bring little nets and try and hunt for little fish and other things in the water for a couple hours.
* Pinnacles National Park has a great cave that you can go with the kids but plan on wearing water shoes because the start(or end, depending on which direction you go) has these little stepping stones which you'll probably slip and get wet from.
* Yosemite is a day trip away (2-ish hours?). That speaks for itself.
* Mt Madonna is close by but not the greatest, we still go there for cookouts and stuff regularly and let the kids run around and find salamanders and banana slugs and stuff.
* Get a State park pass and as long as you go once a month to any state park it pays itself off - it helps especially with going to the beaches around Aptos and also the forests near Big Basin, while Big Basin itself has burned, there are still areas in and around there with amazing redwood forests.
* The Exploratorium is cool in SF, in and around the piers. Land's ending, the golden gate parks on the south side of the bridge and north side (Rodeo beach is cool too which is just a little north of the golden gate, it's got ""black"" pebble sand which makes its beach unique among all others in the entire area).
* Christmas Hill Park along Uvas Creek is a daily trip - if you have dogs, it's a great dog run (I go end to end round trip which is basically 4-ish miles, about an hour).
* Wilder Ranch state park has a great beach and it's an amazing walk right along the cliffs, but be aware that there's no safety - you're walking along a wet cliff that is 50 feet straight down to waves which will show no remorse. I wouldn't let go of my children when walking along there. It also is probably the best location to see sea lions as close as you can.
* Carmel by the Sea is a little small tourist trap town which is fun to walk around with the kids. Similarly with Monterey.
* Tahoe is a trek, so get a cabin for a week there when you need a break. Especially in the winter. It beats any ski resort in the midwest. We take our kids every winter and make snowmen etc.
* Cheap trips - San Diego, Las Vegas / Phoenix for Grand Canyon - with them so close, if you're willing to fly for $100 or less per person, they represent nice, cheap getaways.
* Half Moon Bay is a great town, bit of a trek. They have farms there like the Lemos Farm which has horses and random stuff kids can do that they can't do anywhere else. The beaches there are great, too. Lastly, if you go to the docks during crab season (they come on Sundays in the evening last I checked), you can go and get crabs directly off the boats (cheap snow, king, and dungeness crab as fresh as you can imagine).
* If your children are 6+ years old, you can rent horses with them anywhere - the beach or in the forests, and do some really cool horse trips together. You can also sign them up for horse riding lessons which are generally cheap compared to the midwest since horses here aren't as rare.
* Big Sur is about 1.5 hours south. It has the most picturesque bridges and some of the most unique scenery. Pfeiffer Beach is also amazing, couldn't recommend it enough.

A quick note on the beaches - the waves and rip tides are lethal. Every year, we hear of children getting swept and drowning, and similarly, adults. When you go to the beach with young kids, please watch them and teach them to be alert - a rogue wave can come and sweep them in a heartbeat. It's especially important for young ones. It isn't like Florida with 3 foot waves, here can have huge 12 foot waves dependent on the beach. Additionally, the water is super cold all year round - wetsuits for everybody to swim in the ocean. Lastly, look at the tides - if you go to the beach during low tide, you can walk up to some of the distant areas and check out crabs, starfish, and tons of other stuff! Low tides also are generally the safer times too, it feels like.",t2_5miiu,lawlscoptor,0,1619153837.0,0,t1_gvj7y55,gvj7y55,True,moptop34,t3_mwmoml,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/mwmoml/we_are_moving_to_gilroy/,We Are Moving to Gilroy,/r/Gilroy/comments/mwmoml/we_are_moving_to_gilroy/gvj7y55/,22,r/Gilroy,1,22

To legally place a sign on a utility pole, it must:

Be less than 11 inches in height

No higher than 12 feet from the ground

Conform to the shape of the pole

Be attached with non-adhesive material such as twine, string or other non-metal banding material

Include a legible posting date in the lower right hand corner

Be removed after 10 days, if the sign is promoting a date specific event

Be removed within 70 days of the posting date

Not be installed on historic street light poles*, traffic signal poles or traffic directional sign poles.",t2_3ihmj5i3,TheHouseAIwaysWins,0,1618810178.0,0,t1_gv1tydz,gv1tydz,True,[deleted],t3_mtrf0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/mtrf0u/laws_regarding_placing_posters_around_town/,Laws regarding placing posters around town?,/r/Gilroy/comments/mtrf0u/laws_regarding_placing_posters_around_town/gv1tydz/,0,r/Gilroy,0,0

Haven't done it myself, but based on observation you should anticipate an aggravatingly long permit process.  Depending on the type of business you're planning, there will be various obstacle-courses you will need to run.  I'd suggest chatting with current business owners to see if any have an attorney they'd recommend to help you run the gauntlet.  Attorneys, of course, are not free, but delaying your opening by months because you were unfamiliar with some nitpicky process or requirement could easily be more costly.

"Gilroy is probably the least safe city to live in Santa Clara County because it's the least expensive with the most parolees. But Santa Clara County is among the safest counties in the USA. 

You might encounter a panhandler or tweaker at the bus stop from time to time. Usually just passing through. Shoplifting at the outlet malls ends up in the police blotter. The owner of Pinnochio's Pizza was shot a couple of years back. Unlocked cars sometimes get opened to check for valuables. Fistfights at high schools between rivals is fairly common (less so during the pandemic). Your recycle bin will be regularly dug through by industrious people looking for cans or bottles to redeem for 5c each. And of course the Garlic Festival Massacre occurred last year at Christmas Hill Park; I was there selling sodas to support the high school and having my children shot at -- and one of their nearby friends shot -- was terrifying.

Obviously the above is a mixed bag of horrifying and trivial.

Overall I still really like it here.

"Normal traffic days: M-Th assuming you leave before 530, traffic isn't so bad, but the closer you are to 6 the worse it gets. Coming back will usually take a bit longer. Fridays are generally the worst days coming from Sj back to Gilroy as traffic can start piling as early as 130-2pm, expect HUGE backups coming into and out of MH.

If you can, TRY NOT TO MOVE TO HOLLISTER. Granted the properties over here are wonderfully priced however the added time to commute extends greatly if you plan to live in Hollister. The 25 will start having traffic as early as 0530.

The Hollister route is A LOT easier than Gilroy's.  With the Hollister route they take you on very simple roads and stops; Gilroy's route is nearly the same however I know the test drivers will always take you through downtown and there they'll try to trick you on one specific turn near OD's that has a huge blind spot if there is a lot of parking downtown.,t2_8635g,fpsdr0p,0,1603182185.0,0,t1_g9eyate,g9eyate,True,__tysonnn__,t3_jbgqj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gilroy/comments/jbgqj9/anyone_take_the_hollister_driver_test/,Anyone take the Hollister driver test?,/r/Gilroy/comments/jbgqj9/anyone_take_the_hollister_driver_test/g9eyate/,2,r/Gilroy,0,2

"We like the north side of \[Manresa State Beach\]([https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page\_id=545](https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=545)).  It's a 40 to 45-minute drive from Gilroy.  You can take the 101 around the mountain, or Hecker Pass for some magnificent views on a windy road to get there.  Plenty of parking, 4 bathrooms, and beach access that's a quick walk down some stairs instead of a half-mile hike past the campground.  It's a beach break, so the surfing tends to be a little unpredictable. However, the skimboarding & bodyboarding is consistently pretty good after high tide (but keep an eye out for the rip currents!).  There's a KOA almost across the street if you want to camp in a cabin, or there are highly-in-demand campgrounds a 5-minute walk from the ocean.  Rent some wetsuits, rent a body board, and go experience it!  October & November are the best months for the ocean in this area.  If you're not used to cold water I'd suggest either a fullsuit wetsuit in 3mm/2mm thickness, or a ""shortie"" summer suit (no arms or legs) in 4mm/3mm if you just plan to stay very close to the beach while you play in the water.

Also, check out [Gizdich Ranch](https://www.gizdich-ranch.com) when you have a few minutes after hitting Manresa. It's a Watsonville fixture, selling lots of fresh-baked pies a la mode, sandwiches, and a fresh apple cider (non-alcoholic) that's amazingly tasty.  We really like the Apple Slush Float: like a fresh-pressed apple slushie/icee with vanilla ice cream.  They also have ""u-pick"" fruits: pay a flat fee to eat all you like from the fields, and pay for the stuff you take away.  The pie shop & antique store close promptly at 5PM, and Mama Gizdich has no remorse about showing you the door when they're done cleaning up for the day.

If you go to Watsonville on a Friday, you'll enjoy a farmer's market downtown.  It's less a farmer's market and more a giant weekly celebration of Latino culture... with lots of good fruits & veggies for sale :D

If you go to Morgan Hill on a Saturday morning, you'll enjoy a farmer's market by the Caltrain station.  It's a much smaller & more chill market than Watsonville. Usually just one lone musician playing away for tips in the corner.

Finally, Friday nights also offer [a concert series at Christmas Hill Park](https://visitgilroy.com/upcoming-events/). They just re-opened the park this morning (September 3, 2019).

"Google Maps will tell you that the fastest way from Gilroy to Monterey is US-101 to CA-156 to CA-1.  But if you have an extra 20 minutes or more, CA-152 to CA-1 is a much more interesting drive.

">Might is Right is so far very much focused on throwing out conventional morals for a set that allows one to exercise power indiscriminately as long as you can handle the consequences of doing so.

And what does that specifically have to do with fascism?

For some reason, people - especially people on reddit who believe they're really really smart - have to be reminded time and again that Musolini didn't walk around twirling his moustache saying ""*Ho Ho! I am the bad guy. Today I think it shall please me to dominate and abuse people solely to slake my thirst for power!*"" To the extent that the author of this book wrote something approaching that, it is suspected that he was satirizing that mentality. 

This is a better read for you at this moment: [George Orwell's *What Is Fascism?*](http://orwell.ru/library/articles/As_I_Please/english/efasc)

>It will be seen that, as used, the word ‘Fascism’ is almost entirely meaningless. In conversation, of course, it is used even more wildly than in print. I have heard it applied to farmers, shopkeepers, Social Credit, corporal punishment, fox-hunting, bull-fighting, the 1922 Committee, the 1941 Committee, Kipling, Gandhi, Chiang Kai-Shek, homosexuality, Priestley's broadcasts, Youth Hostels, astrology, women, dogs and I do not know what else.
>
>Yet underneath all this mess there does lie a kind of buried meaning. To begin with, it is clear that there are very great differences, some of them easy to point out and not easy to explain away, between the régimes called Fascist and those called democratic. Secondly, if ‘Fascist’ means ‘in sympathy with Hitler’, some of the accusations I have listed above are obviously very much more justified than others. Thirdly, even the people who recklessly fling the word ‘Fascist’ in every direction attach at any rate an emotional significance to it. By ‘Fascism’ they mean, roughly speaking, something cruel, unscrupulous, arrogant, obscurantist, anti-liberal and anti-working-class. Except for the relatively small number of Fascist sympathizers, almost any English person would accept ‘bully’ as a synonym for ‘Fascist’. That is about as near to a definition as this much-abused word has come.
>
>But Fascism is also a political and economic system. Why, then, cannot we have a clear and generally accepted definition of it? Alas! we shall not get one — not yet, anyway. To say why would take too long, but basically it is because it is impossible to define Fascism satisfactorily without making admissions which neither the Fascists themselves, nor the Conservatives, nor Socialists of any colour, are willing to make.
