"“…and freedom means a lot to us.”

I am unclear what you are implying here. Am I to infer that you believe that freedom doesn’t mean as much to islanders as it does to you? That you are somehow more American than residents of Massachusetts because you avoided vaccination and dislike masks? 

The ego. How quaint.

In case it’s unclear, “freedom” means every bit as much to us as it does to anyone in Florida or any other part of the United States. If you recall, the war that started this beautiful country that exists to defend the “freedom” you care so much about started in our little state. 

We’re also, for the most part, a small community who values our fellow citizens enough to sacrifice a portion of our own comfort for health.

The answer about what to do out on Martha’s Vineyard is, “It depends.” Where on the Island are you going to work? Do you have housing confirmed?

"Good evening, just wanted to chime in to reassure you that the vineyard is a widely accepting community. From time to time I've run into the occasional bigot but bigotry is frowned upon for the most part around here. 

I am a 33 y/o white female and have lived on island my entire life. i understand that you are specifically asking about racism against Asians, but if it makes you feel more comfortable i will say that MV is historically a vacation spot for the black community. Well- known figures such as Malcom X and Dr MLK Jr were said to have vacationed here and the vacation home is part of the island's African American heritage trail and i believe that has attracted the black tourism for a long time. Now Pres Obama and his fam own a home here which now attracts a lot more black tourism. Additionally there is a large year-round Brazilian community here. All of that said, there is not a large Asian community, but i do believe it's growing. If you would feel more comfortable in a more diverse part of the island, i would go to oak bluffs, but you will be fine in any town on the island, unless you get really unlucky and run into a particularly awful person.

Is this travel for business or pleasure? Will your stay be very long? Would it make you feel more comfortable if i were to put you in contact with asian friends?",t2_jnj09dxq,notsointoeverything,0,1644876120.0,0,t1_hwyn3eq,hwyn3eq,True,[deleted],t3_seo9k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/marthasvineyard/comments/seo9k8/racial_tolerance_towards_asian_females/,Racial tolerance towards Asian females,/r/marthasvineyard/comments/seo9k8/racial_tolerance_towards_asian_females/hwyn3eq/,1,r/marthasvineyard,0,1

"You won't have any issues, there is no reason to worry.  Are you coming here for vacation or for work?

I've been traveling there for 35 years and actually haven't personally seen or heard of any racism.  It does exist, as I have have read stories that seem to be corroborated, but it is few and far between and extreme isolated.  

MV is a lovely place.  You probably don't want it, but I'll only mention it because when I'm far from home, I get comfort in comfortable foods.  To my knowledge, there is no authentic Chinese on the island.  There is Americanized-Chinese which is actually pretty good, and I say that living in New York.  Fresh fish is one of MV's obvious treasures.  My wife loves the sushi there because of just how fresh the fish is, and again I'm 8 miles from the ocean where I live so that says a lot of about the quality on MV.

"Yes.  If you are traveling with children then the bigger ferries are probably a better bet with lots of opportunities to wander (with an adult!) and observe.  But it is under an hour so just fine if kids are with you on the freight boat too…just maybe not as much fun.

If you are traveling at sunrise or sunset the freight can be especially nice I think.  Get there early and be at the front of your line.  You might get lucky and be at the back of the boat and have a great view from the comfort of your own car.

All the boats have mechanical mishaps from time to time but they run many times a day and you aren’t likely to be on one that does.  The freights may be more prone to it but I don’t really know.  I worry about lots of things I probably shouldn’t and I just tend not to worry about the ferry having a genuinely dangerous problem.  Maybe I should but I suggest you enjoy it as part of the adventure.

"There is no safe oceanfront anywhere on the Vineyard.  It amuses me that billionaires think it's a good idea to move to an island when global warming is already starting to bite.  Rising sea level is happening, there are already king tides that wash over beach road,  and how secure is the the Vineyard's water supply against salt intrusion?  What are the odds that a hurricane will track north and wipe the island down with salt and wind?  It happened in the 1600's.   New England is overdue for another bad storm.  But sure, buy some oceanfront property.

Might also go bowling in OB.  Definitely check out the gingerbread cottages there for a walk or you can even drive through much of it.

"I dunno.  Maybe it is the deaths and delimbings of so many innocent naive tourists.  We could ask the last big operator of these but he passed out of an OD off island in a fast food drive through and died a short time later.

Maybe it is the knowledge that these guests have a fantasy expectation of not being followed closely by impatient and often intoxicated drivers while negotiating sharp turns covered in sand.  

These moped operators know they sell death and dismemberment and just collect the fantasy money for an island that doesn’t exist for anyone on a budget.

The first responders and witnesses to these scenes are forever impacted, but not like the loved ones of those left behind.  All for a few quick bucks.

"If you both love pasta you have to check out Jimmy Seas Pan Pasta in Oak Bluffs, it’s one my my wife and I’s favorite restaurants on the island. And while you’re in Oak Bluffs, you can walk over to Circuit Ave which is basically one street lined with dozens of fun shops on both sides. Next to the shops you are also in walking distance of the Gingerbread Houses, and Ocean Park which are really fun to walk around! Oak Bluffs Town Beach is right across the street too, if you want to combine activities. 
Other good food places there are The Lookout Tavern for seafood, and Offshore Ale Co. for some amazing pizza! 

Also I almost forgot, you need to have a donut from Backdoor Donuts. At night the lines are crazy, but you can grab one during the day from the main entrance. 

I second taking the drive out to the Aquinnah cliffs, it’s  the most beautiful sight on the island (including the drive out to it). I may be a little biased though because I proposed to my wife there haha. 

In Edgartown, there’s shops and restaurants all down Main St and the surrounding streets. Lots of good places to eat too as it’ll be closer to where you’re staying! 
 
P.S if you guys like fudge, I highly recommend grabbing some from one of the Murdick’s Fudge locations (they have one in both towns)!

Vineyard grocer has an interesting mix of health foods and Brazilian specialties.

You didn’t ask about gardening stuff but we have a number of extremely good nurseries especially up in West Tisbury.

Be sure you sign up for the excursion fare on the ferry.  Huge discounts.  I agree electronics are an off island or online purchase. 

Enjoy.  It takes some getting used to but we have found after many years here that we rarely miss the big box stores.  As a rule we try to buy local even if it means paying a bit more but with Amazon and even Walmart delivery you can get just about everything you could want.

When I got turned around at Alleys yesterday afternoon I had a bad feeling. Happened almost in the same spot a man lost his life in a moped accident a few years ago. There’s just not enough room on the roads for these things. People who have never ridden a moped are being sketchily passed by people who have never had to pass a moped before. Tragedy. Really should ban renting them here but it’ll never happen unfortunately.

"BAN MOPEDS.  


Here is my rant about the island:

The ferry should not charge for bicycles.. charge the cars more to cover the $4 bike tax.  
Ferry parking in Falmouth/Wareham/Plymouth should be \_very\_ cheap.. again, charge the cars going over more to cover this. Put a parking lot on the other side of the bridge with coach busses in the peak season. Getting in a bus is a pain whether its near or far..  
Buses on MV should be free and there should be an increase in schedules and routes, not a decrease. It takes time for everyone to pay, for everyone to figure out rates and costs and destinations, to queue in a line. Free public transportation that is readily available will transform the island.  
Finish the bike paths. The island bike paths are EPIC and amazing, but need more consistent upkeep and even more expansion.  
BAN mopeds, because people die. This hurts tourism and is incredibly sad because it is so easily preventable.  
Enforce speed limiters on electric rental bikes. These electric bikes can transform someones vacation and get non-bikers from town to town, replacing the need for moped, but the speed limiters need to be enforced otherwise these are dangerous for everyone.  
Ok.. now with these simple things we have encouraged more people to visit more towns with more of their money to spend on local businesses while reducing pollution + congestion + and making it easier for locals to get to work. This is how the island can scale up its revenue per person. Cars need to be highly discouraged and taxed heavily, and unlike NYC we have a simple way of doing that already!",t2_c8m66,mightyferrite,0,1630244564.0,0,t1_hasvnub,hasvnub,True,AlrightJanice,t3_pduysh,https://www.reddit.com/r/marthasvineyard/comments/pduysh/lexus_driver_strikes_moped_killing_the_smaller/,"Lexus driver strikes moped, killing the smaller vehicle's passenger",/r/marthasvineyard/comments/pduysh/lexus_driver_strikes_moped_killing_the_smaller/hasvnub/,12,r/marthasvineyard,0,12

"I am really sorry you are in this situation!  This place is fundamentally out of balance when hard working people like you want to stay here, are willing to pay a lot of money to do it, and are willing to live communally with people you don’t know well.  Meanwhile, employers are desperate for workers like you.  I will be honest with you…I don’t think you are likely to find a place unless you find an employer that will provide housing.  And I don’t think it is right that people should have to have their housing tied to an employer because it gives way too much leverage to that employer.  It is like “company towns” from way back when.  I don’t know why you feel the urgent need to live here and nowhere else, but respect your motives.  You won’t be able to change the politics of this all in time to find safe decent housing.  Leave if you can.  If you can’t, reach out to employers, clergy (I am not religious myself at all but they go the extra mile here to keep people safe and fed) and most of all, I wish you the best of luck!

The Port Hunter in Edgartown for lunch/drinks.  Go to the Chappy Ferry and go up that viewing area where everyone is fishing and take a look for 10 mins.

"You won't have time nor ease to get to Gay Head Cliffs.  There are no facilities or refreshments at South Beach, so you'll have to pack an insulated bag and pick up drinks in OB, and pack a towel.  

You could go straight to South Beach for a few hours - bus to EDG, then switch to South Beach bus.  Come back to EDG and have a nice lunch and walk around town.  Options for lunch: The Atlantic (sit outside along the pier), Roxanna at the Harborview Hotel's pool (great property to explore), Behind the Bookstore. Cheaper options: Among the Flowers, Seafood Shanty (I dislike the food there but fun for drinks on the roof patio).  

Take bus back to OB and shop around there. Look at the Gingerbread houses/Camp Meeting Association.  Have drinks on the pier.  Coop de Ville for long beer list, no hard liquor.

 Alpacas hum. Some say it is from contentment but it seems to be broader than that. Humming is an outward display of emotions.

If you haven’t been you might want to take her to the alpaca farm.  Those things are seriously cute and the people who run it are really nice (no affiliation, not even friends of mine).  Nice gift shop with a lot of cuddly things at not too high a sticker price.  

Flying Horses is open again.  And some new owners took over the Katama restaurant by the airfield.  Lots of small planes taking off and landing including a red biplane.

Can go watch people fish off the dock in OB or off big bridge on the way to Edgartown.  Or maybe the big kids will be jumping off the bridge.  Either way it could be good amusement.

"Oddly enough it doesn’t matter that much.  The value is in the ability to put a house on it.  It is nowhere near a linear relationship...a quarter acre isn’t worth a quarter of an acre lot assuming both are buildable under zoning.  More like a quarter acre is worth ninety percent or more.  Obviously this is a generalization and different neighborhoods command different prices.

"I’m all for it! More than happy to share my views.

Sorry to hear about the issues of your partner’s work. The neighbor should try to strike a deal with the farm  instead of trying to get something for nothing.

If you want to reach out and meet people, most people here use Facebook. The Islanders Talk group is a crapshoot because you’ll have people on there that have nothing to do with the island, but if you read through the posts and comments, you might see some obvious clues about who’s hi. There are a lot of nutty people here and elsewhere who are obsessed with this place.

I’d like to add that I don’t have an issue with anyone who wants to move here and be part of the community. Nor do I take issue with people who want the luxury of owning a second home, on principle, but the later is a privilege and needs to be paid for. Lots and lots of people want to be here. That’s fine, but Locals being forced out of if their communities due to housing costs and very little work to compete is unacceptable.

All of that said, I don’t believe that MV will ever be what it once was. That magic is gone. I’m planning to leave myself, but I’m at the very beginning stages of planning for that. The kinds of people buying property here are the hedge fund manager types. They do work long hours and they do not have much of a life. I respect that. It’s just really too bad that the needs of people who were part of something that was established long before the wealthy seasonal homeowners arrived are given less importance than the wants of people who only view owning property here as a status symbol.",t2_a1ind3b6,SmashinCetacean,0,1617330366.0,0,t1_gt3ocv1,gt3ocv1,False,Many_Face7064,t3_mi28w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/marthasvineyard/comments/mi28w7/grad_student_mv_community_investigation_input/,Grad Student- MV Community Investigation- INPUT NEEDED!,/r/marthasvineyard/comments/mi28w7/grad_student_mv_community_investigation_input/gt3ocv1/,4,r/marthasvineyard,0,4
