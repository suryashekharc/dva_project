"Might want to consider clover.

Crabgrass/Bermuda grass took over the most sun beaten portions of my yard last year. In the fall I decided to do a little experiment and just tossed a bunch of clover seed in big spot that had been practically reduced to dirt. The clover sprang up quickly last fall and survived the winter. It's now the only nice green looking section of my lawn. I'm surprised at how well it did through the winter (mild winter, though) and how nice it looks. Seems to hold up pretty well with foot traffic.

Clover seems to have outcompeted crab/bermuda grass where I threw seed down. Where I didn't, crab/bermuda grass took over. This past weekend I dethatched and aerated and then today I overseeded the shit out of my whole lawn with clover seed. Fingers crossed.

I think I'm throwing in the towel on directly fighting with crabgrass and other annoying grasses. My plan is to keep overseeding in both spring and fall with clover on the hope that it'll fill the lawn in and make life harder for the other annoying grasses. As a bonus it's supposed to need less water. Maybe a clover/crab/bermuda mix is optimal in this climate. Should stay pretty green on low water.",t2_lmz53,zipzapbloop,0,1648518810.0,0,t1_i2ihky1,i2ihky1,False,eclipsedrambler,t3_te6yq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/te6yq8/preemergent/,Pre-emergent,/r/ogden/comments/te6yq8/preemergent/i2ihky1/,1,r/ogden,0,1

"If you haven't already, look into getting a realtor for buying a home. The housing market in Utah is pretty cut throat and it was incredibly difficult for my wife and I to find a place as first time home buyers. 

You're most likely going to have to put an offer on something without seeing it in person, over asking price around 30 to 40k, with an appraisal gap and potentially a non refundable clause essentially paying someone to accept your offer. 

If that's a lot it may be a good idea to find an apartment or something for 6 months or so in the area so you can get settled in with your new job and learning the area and what part of town you'd like to live in. 

Typically homes along the Wasatch front are on the market for only a couple of days before they go under contract. If there's an open house over the weekend expect that home to receive 15-20 offers to choose from.

"True. 

I wouldn’t know what to do with an unrepentant kid if I had one. But I’m thinking there are probably professionals in our community that have the knowledge and authority to do something for this bunch. 

I doubt splashing this all over Reddit will do anything to help the attitude problem, or the behavior problem. And it seems incredibly invasive to post this stuff instead of just showing it to the relevant adults in the situation (principals, parents, cops, whoever).

Honestly I was a shitty kid sometimes. I don’t know if I was ever this bad, but I know that when adults responded with righteous indignation I immediately thought they were self-important twats and didn’t listen to anything they said. If they had outright attacked me or my parents, I would have been thunderstruck, but it would also have just further entrenched my belief that they were assholes who didn’t know anything.

"Yeah, he can post if he wants. Doesn’t mean it’s a good idea. 

Do you honestly think kids like this should go to jail? Do you have any idea what prisons are like?

I’m genuinely curious where all of the anger on this post is coming from. Because to me, that kind of punishment mindset is incredibly extreme and tends to result in worse and worse damage. Unless someone’s truly a danger to others, there’s no point in having a torches and pitchforks reaction. If your real goal is to prevent property damage, public and private, online harassment isn’t going to help. 

It’s not that the destructive behavior isn’t shitty. It is. But IT HAPPENS. People make BAD DECISIONS. Especially when they’re young.

"Make sure you are checking the dates on the neighborhood and apartments reviews. Several historic apartments have been renovated, and the influx of higher income people has drastically affected the crime.

8 years ago, my sister and I each moved into super cheap homes in bad neighborhoods. There was, for example, a shooting in my neighborhood literally once a month. (24th St, East of the library). Open sale and use of drugs abounded.  Anything left on the porch or in the bed of our truck was stolen.

Now, my neighborhood is completely safe. Meth labs were demolished or bought/renovated by the city. Amazon packages remain safe in open view on our porch. A new school was built a couple years ago. Kids play safely in front yards. It's completely different from the reviews in 2015.

"I forget her name, but there's a gal in the garden center at IFA that's a great resource for everything plants. 

Their 4 step fertilizer is decent too and lists a general time frame for application. 
But to my general understanding, getting pre-emergent in the fall helps a lot the next spring because it gets watered in over the winter. 

One of the troubles with pre-emergent in the spring is ensuring it gets watered in properly. If you're on secondary water, it's too late by the time they prime the system for a pre-emergent to be effective. And rainstorms can be tricky to catch or don't dump enough.

I homeschooled my boys until high school. If your parents are uncomfortable with you participating with one of the public schools, perhaps they would feel you are safe joining clubs at one of the charter schools? If they are liberal/diversity-friendly, then Davinci has a ton of ten clubs: anime, robotics competition, art, theater, and service. If they are religious/conservative, then Ogden Prepatory could be a good choice?

The bike collective is a nice community too. In addition to getting a bike, you can learn skills and make friends there.

Ogden's community centers used to offer a lot of free or cheap classes and activities for elders and teens. We went to the Marshall White Center for swimming, jewelry making, and service. They also have basketball, table tennis, etc. 

At your age, you could also talk to your parents about taking a class or joining a club or service organization at Weber or the OWATC.

"It is from public databases, but they are subscription based to access remotely. 

https://www.webercountyutah.gov/Recorder_Surveyor/abstract_title_reg.php

They are free to access if you physically go to the Weber County Recorder's office(except for copies and printouts of course). Unfortunately if you don't know what you are doing it is not very user friendly and county employees can only help you so much. They are limited in what they can do because of liability.

Researching a property prior to 1981 can be done, but is much easier with help from somebody who does this for a living. It involves reading the handwritten abstracts that are kept in the recorder's vault. 

The Utah Business Entity Search is free for basic use, it's a few bucks if you want/need to dig in deeper. 

https://secure.utah.gov/bes/index.html

One of my favorite completely free resources is: 

https://parcels.utah.gov/

You can use this to drill down to specific addresses or tax serial numbers and get a decent overhead by turning on the hybrid view in the top right. You can also just scroll to zoom into whatever you are looking for. Keep in mind that this only shows basic ownership lines and is sometimes out of date. There are **no** easements shown. 

The county courts are also available for a small monthly fee on xchange:

Utah - Smith Lc did sell the land/building to Swift Port Inc back in March of 2000. But the Utah Business Entity search discloses that Swift Port was just another Smith owned company.

Swift Port Inc then sold the property off to National Federal Lands Conference, A Utah Non Profit, but [surprise, surprise, surprise,](https://c.tenor.com/1N-RSV0yQ0IAAAAd/gomer-surprise-gomer.gif) that too is owned by Smith.

Pine View and the ski resorts (Snow Basin, Powder Mountain, and Nordic Valley) could all be options while you're in town, but we have had very little snow this year.

You'll find cheaper housing in Ogden, but not as much diversity as SLC. However, more diversity than in Davis or Utah county. Overall, it's a good mix in my opinion. More of a small town feel but still a good amount of bars, restaurants, and activities around town. I'm a real estate agent in the area, feel free to PM me if you have any questions. Even if you've already made connections with an agent, happy to just provide you general info about the area and can suggest some Mortgage Lenders/Brokers that you can connect with.

I’ve stayed at all of them and the vibe at Hampton was best and the room was most comfortable. Parking was a fee for Valet. Marriott use the be the overall winner based on price and location and parking but had prices themselves out of the running last time I checked. Still all of the bars and restaraunts are just out your door for the busier section of 25th. You can’t go wrong with any of these recommendations they are spot on.  You could really skip the car and take trax and just uber if you don’t have many places to be because it’s very walkable.,t2_iq23h4c,SweetHeatherBeee,0,1646294511.0,0,t1_hz5py7u,hz5py7u,True,_0x0_,t3_t5c39p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/t5c39p/visiting_ogden_for_business_need_hotel_suggestions/,"Visiting Ogden for business, need hotel suggestions",/r/ogden/comments/t5c39p/visiting_ogden_for_business_need_hotel_suggestions/hz5py7u/,1,r/ogden,0,1

"Hi there!

Downtown Ogden is fun. It's known as 25th street. There are bars, restaurants(if you like pizza and beer, try Slackwater on 24th or Lucky Slice on 25th), coffee shops, and some small shops that are fun to peruse. There's a fun (but small) train museum to check out. 

The art district is under a ton of construction right now, but it's still fun to see local artists and their art. 

We have our own minor league baseball team that plays at Lindquist Field (a block away from 25th street.) We also have an amphitheater that hosts live bands, local musicians all throughout the summer. The music vibes  range from acoustic (think Iron & Wine) to pop. 

The farther east you go, you'll be in the mountains and almost every road ends in a hiking/biking trail head that boasts great views of the Ogden Valley. Most of the hiking is easy, but make sure you take water with you. It can get incredibly hot incredibly quickly. 

We're a short drive to a couple ski resorts, and Pineview Dam is about half an hour away by car and is fun for swimming or boating. 

Every July (July 24th), we celebrate our statehood anniversary. There are always rodeos going on along with fireworks. (The fireworks are dependent upon how dry the state is at the time.) There's usually a parade and carnivals galore.

What model is your dryer and when you say loud, what exactly do you mean? Squeaky? thumping? grinding? 

Replacing dryer parts is way easier than you might think, and theres usually a youtube video out there to help you out.

Other than that though, it's a great place to live. Small town feel, an hour away from SLC for those big city amenities, close to the outdoors, and less than an hour from two great ski resorts. However, one thing I've noticed is that home prices have been skyrocketing. In the last year, our home's value has appreciated by at least 30% (current market value is approx 130% of purchase price), hence why we are planning to move in a few years instead of right now (i.e. to avoid a huge capital gains tax).",t2_xxtjv,Reno83,0,1644880693.0,0,t1_hwyu1pk,hwyu1pk,True,sillydustbunny,t3_srywfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/srywfh/what_are_the_positives_and_negatives_of_living_in/,What are the positives and negatives of living in Ogden?,/r/ogden/comments/srywfh/what_are_the_positives_and_negatives_of_living_in/hwyu1pk/,3,r/ogden,0,3

"I'm a transplant that lived in Layton for a year, then Ogden for the last 5. 

Weber County is the most racially diverse area in Utah (backed by census data). That being said, I wouldn't necessarily say it's not racist. It's still Utah, unfortunately. There's also great LGBTQ+ support. 

The public schools are also rated very poorly across most of the area, particularly beyond elementary. The best are charter/private schools, so have fun with that.

Housing. What can we say about housing. As someone that is in process of selling, I'm really happy to be getting out right now. My house doubled in value in five years. Ogden and SLC are both in the top ten of overvalued housing markets in the US; Ogden at 3, SLC at 9. You're likely to find more house for your money up here, but depending on what you're looking for, potentially more ""value"" in SLC. I work on the north side of SLC, with a 38 mi one way commute. Even with bad traffic, the trip is rarely over an hour. The train can also be very convenient if you need to use it. 

As far as jobs go, Utah wages are getting better depending on where you look, but they're largely not on track with the exploding inflation for the area.

"I went to the NDI program there last year and it was great, it was right next to the Composites program so I was able to see a lot of work they did every class.

Have you researched the college a bit? It's different from Weber State because it's a hand on technical college where you learn at your own pace. It's probably the same for the Composites program but for the NDI program we had to watch videos through an approved accredited site that would help acknowledge the online learning when we graduated for an employer.

I would expect you would watch videos for each unit you're on and then you would do the lab portion of it. 

The school is honestly amazing and I would have gone there sooner had I not had every single person tell me to get a bachelors degree from a university, no one bothered to ever tell me about doing a trade instead.

Because of the education I received from the OWACT I was actually offered a job up here in North Carolina for $26 an hour starting and they even helped me move out here with a moving expense, Composites is one of the top up and coming careers so do it and be ready to get a lot of hands on experience!",t2_hlq11,dabrothergoose,0,1644334715.0,0,t1_hw3come,hw3come,True,jimmyroberts_cats94,t3_shdw58,https://www.reddit.com/r/ogden/comments/shdw58/moving_back_to_ogden_area_this_spring_opinions_on/,Moving back to Ogden area this spring.

"Who wrote the comments ? Do they live in America? Utah? I would assume they don't, because their opinions seem to come entirely out of their imagination.
Currently the status of the hotsprings is , they are amazing and a treasure, I live within a couple miles and enjoy them as often as possible, I don't want to attract more ppl as they are fairly popular but can still find yourselves alone enjoying it a to yourself. Late fall of 2021 locals did a nice job improving the narrow path that meanders above and along the river as well as reorienting and recreating the lower pools that are at river level and along side the river damned and divided off by rocks that get washed and scrambled up every spring and summer as the rivers level rises and drowns them till the fall, the 3 tubs above the river level are awesome I wish I could thank and know more of or about the people who made some of the initial efforts building the pool rock tubs they did a terrific job and I feel lucky to have such a awesome retreat that's not developed into some regulated steril unnatural commodity.  To sit in the moonlight down a dirt path listening to the river flowing by out in nature has a feeling you cannot recreate in an development nor can you retain it through development, it will be gone , that feeling or experience I can't define exactly but it's not just the water the warmth the night sky open air or the river sounds its all of the mixed in with the raw sensations you get only from nature , the sometimes sketchy icy narrow turns you confront with risk if 20 plus foot drop down to rocks a d river, or the idea that ya maybe some creeper could be out there in the dark , or maybe a mountain lion or whatever it is , the point is the fact its not a paved trail with bright lights and a concessions stand  is the most valuable attributes of the place.   Many know exactly what I mean without my bad description and grammer, those who don't are missing out on what I consider the best things in life simple experiences in nature that keep me acquainted with my connection of my body to the earth to the universe , without that nourishment  I would be join the growing numbers of the walking dead.

If I knew any Italian I’d meet up with you. The extent of my Italian is learning a single phrase from back in the early 90’s when language programs started showing up on the desktop computer.

"Often Xfinity is the only decent option unfortunately. Century link and wireless are slow. But yeah Xfinity has lots of issues. I set up an internet monitoring raspberry Pi to track because I used to have frustrating frequent outages (out for 7-10 minutes several times a day at random) and their techs couldn't find any problems and had no suggestions other than trying to get me to rent the official Xfinity modem Rather than the netgear equipment I'd purchased. After a major outages across Roy and West Haven in October I quit having random frequent outages so whatever they fixed must have helped. But there have been several other hour plus outages over a wide area since October. I subscribe to 200 mbps and have had no issues with the speed (verified by the raspberry Pi) it either works great or not at all, no in between.

"Dunno. I wish that were the case. If it were just me, it might be fine, but both my partner and I wfh and have to be on zoom, etc, so we need higher than 20mb upload. I checked and that is literally the soft cap on their service, you cannot buy a residential plan with higher. The download is fine when it's working.
