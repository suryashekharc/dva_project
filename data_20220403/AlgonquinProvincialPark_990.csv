"totally agree, we were on opeongo south when i had some experience canoeing but none with canoe camping. The day started beautiful, nice stops on sandy beaches, got cocky, decided to try checking out bates island and up around it,  then the weather really quickly turned and we got caught in awful wind / rain before we could make it back to the calmer narrow south part.  I'll take a portage over fickle weather on a big lake any day, imo, easy decision, at least portages are somewhat predictable, you can stop and rest, take multiple trips, etc.",t2_i5qnme3v,squeakyToasterOven,0,1649002679.0,0,t1_i38l2qq,i38l2qq,False,Technical_Meringue,t3_tutb1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/tutb1o/which_lake_to_camp_at_for_beginner_back_country/,Which lake to camp at for beginner back country?,/r/algonquinpark/comments/tutb1o/which_lake_to_camp_at_for_beginner_back_country/i38l2qq/,1,r/algonquinpark,0,1

"Most well-built canoes should be durable and last a lifetime. Durability vs. weight is usually an inverse relationship, but modern materials make it so that a lot of weight can be shed while still maintaining a ton of strength. Looking at the materials can be a bit tricky because sometimes a very similar equivalent can be called different names depending on the manufacturer. For example, Nova Craft uses Aramid which is very similar to Kevlar from other manufacturers

&#x200B;

>Aramid is a type of fiber that is known for its strength and durability. Kevlar is essentially a subclass of Aramid because it uses a para-aramid structure, and it’s related to other types of Aramids. Kevlar is also very strong and durable. At first glance, you may confuse Kevlar and Aramid for being the same type of material, and essentially they are equivalent, but they do have minor differences. A lot of the differences are very technical and small, so they aren’t really substantial for the average person.

There's also a lot of material blending nowadays to reap the benefits of a combination of materials, like a Carbon Kevlar.

All of the big manufacturers will have several options that fit what you're looking for.

*""enough room for 2 people, packs, and a medium sized dog""* just means you'll be looking at tandem boats (2 seats) in the 16'-18' range.

*""light for portages \~60lbs or less""* just means you'll need to look at the lightweight material options available

Basically, each manufacturer will be able to fit your requirements so you should be comparing some other factors like pricing, aesthetic, add-ons (foot brace, skid plates, optional finishes, etc.), availability (going to be very tough if you want something for this summer season).

Swift and Nova Craft are good options as others have mentioned. You should take a look at H2O as well, but don't let their website fool you (very outdated), they'll be updating their online presence very soon. They're becoming more popular with outfitters in the park because their boats are very strong, very light, and a bit cheaper than equivalent boats from Swift. All their boats are made-to-order and they're one of the only manufacturers that use epoxy resin instead of gelcoat.",t2_tpajv,sketchy_ppl,0,1649001656.0,0,t1_i38imef,i38imef,True,eu-jeansnake,t3_tvbdri,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/tvbdri/investing_in_a_canoe/,Investing in a Canoe,/r/algonquinpark/comments/tvbdri/investing_in_a_canoe/i38imef/,3,r/algonquinpark,0,3

"They're both great in terms of what they offer, customer service, etc.

Portage Store is popular because of its location, but they have the highest prices.

Algonquin Outfitters is cheaper, but will require delivery, or pickup on the way (it's literally right off the highway 10min before the access point).

If you don't mind the very minor inconvenience, go with Algonquin Outfitters to save $$. One exception to this would be if you want the lightest tandem canoe possible; the Portage Store carries the H2O Pro Lite weighing approx. 33lbs and I don't believe Algonquin Outfitters, or any other outfitter in the park really, has a comparable tandem boat in terms of weight. It will cost a decent bit more money to rent, but if you want the lightest possible then that's your best choice.

*""I’m thinking we can just paddle from Canoe to Smoke????""*

It's a short walk over, about 200m (2min). It's not a paddle. There's car parking at Smoke Lake so all your gear can be driven directly to the launch, it would just be the canoe you would want to walk over since it wouldn't be worth the time it takes to strap to the top of your car when it's only a 2min walk.

"I've mostly solo tripped for about 5 years now in a 16ft prospector with 21-23 day solo trips the last 3 years. I also use it on tandem trips on long weekends. On the longer trips I'll have a 115L slogg pack and a small barrel. I used a 55L random dry bag as an adjustable water ballast bag when solo depending on the wind. This is the game changer for wind IMO more than a foot of length.  I've done this on 3 week trips in algonquin (including the meanest link) as well as a Wabakimi trip last summer. 

All that said I just upgraded from my 16ft silver creek kevlar prospector to 15ft Nova Craft tuff stuff prospector (mainly for material). The shorter canoe actually has 50lbs more capacity (850 vs 800) due to being a deeper shape. The Nova craft 16ft only has 150lb more capacity. 

I'm a bigger guy and with 3 weeks gear and food am probably at 350 lbs of load. This doesn't fully double even with a 2nd person, so think about if the difference in capacity will really make a difference in your intended usage.

">**Solo Canoe**: A solo canoe has one seat situated in the middle of the boat. This is the ideal spot to paddle from and you can choose to either sit on the seat, or kneel in front of it on the bottom of the boat. Since the seat is situated in the middle of the boat, there will be no yoke permanently attached to the boat. If you’re renting a solo canoe, make sure it includes a detachable yoke.  
**Pack Canoe:** A pack canoe is almost identical to a regular solo canoe, however the seat is on the bottom of the canoe. Since you are lower in the canoe while paddling, you need to use a double-blade paddle (ie. kayak paddle) rather than a single-blade paddle. Pack canoes can be more stable on the water and help you travel faster, but personally I prefer the overall experience of paddling a regular solo canoe much better.

15 Tips to Help Plan Your Solo Canoe Trip: [https://algonquinbeyond.com/blog/15-tips-to-help-plan-your-solo-canoe-trip/](https://algonquinbeyond.com/blog/15-tips-to-help-plan-your-solo-canoe-trip/)

Pack boat will offer more stability (lower centre of gravity) and let you travel faster, but it strips away part of the traditional canoeing experience. Like others have mentioned, the main difference is the seat up high vs seat on the ground. A kayak paddle is needed for a pack boat, but optional for a regular solo canoe. Using a kayak paddle will give you more speed at the cost of control and maneuverability. For big lakes many people prefer pack canoes because it lets them cross the lake faster. But for your trip down the Tim River, you'd be better off using a regular solo canoe with a single blade paddle. You don't need speed going down a river, but you do need maneuverability.",t2_tpajv,sketchy_ppl,0,1648908617.0,0,t1_i33ydat,i33ydat,True,Pai467,t3_tuhjis,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/tuhjis/solo_paddling_canoe_vs_pack_boat/,Solo Paddling Canoe vs Pack Boat?,/r/algonquinpark/comments/tuhjis/solo_paddling_canoe_vs_pack_boat/i33ydat/,2,r/algonquinpark,0,2

"A solo canoe has a standard canoe seat, whereas a pack boat has a kayak seat which sits on the floor of the boat.  Typically you would use a canoe paddle with a solo canoe, and a kayak paddle with a pack boat, but you can use a kayak paddle with a solo canoe as well, you just won't have the luxury of the backrest and foot support for leverage.

Depends what you want to do.  I personally prefer a solo canoe to a pack boat because I feel much more relaxed and enjoy the stroke of a canoe paddle than using a kayak paddle.

"I think you've gotten some good recommendations here.

I would echo both the other comments quickly; that it's easy and no rush to double carry all the portages from canoe Lake to burnt island, and that for 2 people it's often easier to just split the food between your 2 packs.

Just to add some new information to the mix:
If you don't have a harness for the food barrel, it really limits your single carry ability, which is already limited with two kayaks.

One option, if the kayaks are fairly lightweight you can have one person carry both kayaks, one on each shoulder, and have the other take the food barrel. Each takes their own pack too. They are easy portages, very well maintained and quite short.

Another option, if your kayak is fairly rigid and has a front + rear handle, each of you put on your pack, you can leave the food barrel in one of the kayaks, then one of you takes the front handles of each kayak and one takes the back handles of each kayak. If your food barrel is super heavy or your kayak is an ultralight thing, you may cause damage to your kayak this way, so keep that in mind.",t2_16p7wl0o,StefOutside,0,1648862322.0,0,t1_i3228fn,i3228fn,True,Dylancoulson,t3_tu51om,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/tu51om/advice_for_carrying_a_food_barrel_while_portaging/,Advice for carrying a food barrel while portaging?,/r/algonquinpark/comments/tu51om/advice_for_carrying_a_food_barrel_while_portaging/i3228fn/,5,r/algonquinpark,0,5

"Be respectful of nature.  Pick up after yourself.  Stay hydrated, even on cool days.  Keep on the lookout both to spot animals, but also to stay safe, especially since many hikes can be muddy, slick and slippery this time of year.  Wear good hiking boots if you have them.

This time of year and into May, moose can often be seen in the ditches on the side of highway 60 because they're attracted to the road salt that leeches into the water when everything melts.  Best times to see them is say about 1/2 hour before dawn to say about an hour after dawn, and then also 1/2 hour or so on either side of sunset.

BUT BE CAREFUL AND STAY VERY ALERT!!!!!!

Moose, especially males, can be HUGE, and if they're out in the ditches, they're also crossing roadways.  If you hit a moose going 70 km/h or so, you will not win that battle.

Also, don't be idiotic like sooooo many park visitors.  Moose may seem extremely docile just drinkin' water and eating lilies in the ditches and swamps, but they can be spooked or angered.  They can outrun most cars in the park and crash through forests so they can definitely cover the space between you and them in a couple of seconds.  Don't try to get up close.  It's dangerous, and is disrespectful and stressful to the animals.  Keep a safe distance and either in or close to your vehicle.

"I've done Opeongo > Lake la Muir (through Big Trout) > Big Crow > Lavielle, and Opeongo > Dickson (as sections of two different trips).  What you are proposing can and has been done in seven days, though two rest days may be tricky (assuming you travel at a similar pace).  There are a couple of difficult parts, but you would pass through some beautiful and remote parts of the park.  I'd recommend extra time on Lavielle, and perhaps la Muir or Hogan, both of which have a nice remote feel.  I remember the 2590m portage between Big Trout and La Muir being one of the easier 2k+ portages if you don't want to repeat Longer lake.

I don't think it would matter which way you go about it.  I have perhaps a slight preference for ""clock-wise"" if only to travel downstream on the Crow river, but I don't think there would be that large a difference.

For reference: I'm not a fast traveler, and like to keep travel days below 20km / 5hrs moving time.  We single carry every portage. The pace gives me and my paddling partners lots of time to explore what we come across, relax, and soak things in (which means our ""elapsed"" travel time is often longer than what Jeff's Map predicts).  

Another suggestion to consider: Start at Cedar Lake, and move through Catfish, Burntroot, La Muir, Hogan, Philip, and Radiant.  I've done this one clockwise.  I would recommend counter-clockwise to (hopefully) hook up with the prevailing winds on the larger lakes, and go with the current on the Madawaska (especially near Radiant).",t2_7havohkb,shaggycanoeist,0,1648838011.0,0,t1_i30kpvx,i30kpvx,True,rawb_dawg,t3_traqg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/traqg0/ideas_for_a_good_7_night_canoe_trip/,Ideas for a good 7 night canoe trip?,/r/algonquinpark/comments/traqg0/ideas_for_a_good_7_night_canoe_trip/i30kpvx/,1,r/algonquinpark,0,1

Either way the magnetewan access is super nice.

"My fall trips usually revolve around...

i) Starting from an access off Hwy 60 because the drive down Hwy 60 in the fall is breathtaking. Plus, it's nice to take advantage of the busiest area of the park when it's not very busy

ii) Building in a hike at some point in the trip... Booths Rock Trail, Skymount Lookout, etc. The best view of fall colours is from above.

iii) Base camp and take it easy. Days are shorter and the cold temps outside mean you'll spend more time doing chores (mainly collecting/processing wood).

I do harder trips earlier in the season. When fall colours come around, I like taking it easy and enjoying the backcountry with an easy trip for one last time before packing it in for the season.

If you did want to do an actual route instead of base camping, I'd recommend something like Smoke > Big Porc > Phipps > Head x2 > Smoke, or the popular Rock > Pen > Welcome > Louisa x2 > Rock. Both of those options start off Hwy 60 and let you build in a hike if you want.

You can't go wrong with whatever you choose.

edit: if you're new to fall tripping and/or if you're going solo, I'd probably avoid the Canoe to Burntroot suggestion.

"Thanks for the reply! Big Trout loop up to Burntroot is also my favourite and I will be doing it again this October. I was shocked how much poison ivy there actually was on the portage between Longer and Red Pine the first time I did it. I prefer to go through Lake la Muir to avoid it. Very unfortunate because I really prefer the Longer route.

I already have a similar Smoke lake trip booked through Louisa (Smoke>Big Porcupine>Louisa>Head>Smoke) this May so I have that covered.

The Magnetawan trip is a good idea. I've only taken it to Misty so it would be nice to link it all the way to White Trout.

I'm pretty eager to try the Opeongo region. What do you think of my proposed loop?

It is only me and 1 other in a tandem canoe. Single carry. Priorities are to cover lots of the park and stay on nicer looking lakes. Fishing is a plus.

"Solo or with a group? Single carrying or double carrying portages? Priorities for the trip (campsites, fishing, etc.)?

I really love Canoe up to Burntroot and back.

The 'up' part of the route would be Canoe > Otterslide > Big Trout > Burntroot and then the way back down you could either retrace your steps, go through McIntosh, or go through Sunbeam.

Canoe > Otterslide > Big Trout > Burntroot > White Trout > McIntosh or Sunbeam > Canoe

All of those lakes would be great choices for a rest day too (other than Otterslide, personally wouldn't rest day there on this type of route).

The route has great campsites, beautiful lakes, a mix of river and lake travel, the opportunity to paddle Grassy Bay early morning which is a personal favourite, and it's very easy portage wise for a 7 night trip.

"I have a solo Wenonah Wilderness 15.5', my buddy has a tandem Wenonah Prospector 15'. Both work well for solo paddling, he had his bow seat moved back a little to make soloing better. I've never noticed an issue in the bow while tandem so I think it was a good choice considering he's often paddling solo. 

My boat is a race car compared to his. Even if I'm single blading it I can literally paddle circles around him. It does ride high and the wind can catch it, but that's a bonus for longer trips as I can load a tonne of gear into it. I've considered adding a couple of dry bag to my kit to add weight. Fill them with water, on the bow, one in the stern. Then I could weigh it down for paddles and drop the extra weight for portages, but honestly the wind really isn't much of an issue unless it's very high or the boat is completely empty. I imagine a 14' wouldn't have that problem. 

If I could only have one boat I'd go for the tandem, it's more versatile, but my buddy stores his boat on my backyard rack so I have both. If you really are mostly paddling solo a proper solo boat is wonderful. I did a 4 day solo trip on the French and I was able to fly through the large sections with motorboats and really enjoy the quiet parts.

"Yeah with care I don’t see why it wouldn’t last forever. Swifts are a great brand, same with nova craft, h2o and Langford. 

We went with h2o because we had used them before as rentals from outfitters in the park and liked them. It was also about 1500 dollars less for a similarly weighted product. I think it ended up taking about 6 months for production time as their orders skyrocketed with covid.

"I really don't think you'll need to worry about portaging the 3400, or the 1580 or 2065 before it, even with fairly new canoeists. The first like 100m of the 3400 is class II, but otherwise that whole section is just fun, bouncy class I. All you need is to pay attention and have the basics of how to maneuver. Have your group spend some time watching videos of how to canoe whitewater (Bill Mason's videos are great resources) and do some practice on flatwater, but you'll be fine.

"The beaches on Traverse are glorious. Highly recommend you take the first afternoon to lounge out. The three on the north shore, east end, but before the three in a tight triangle are all stellar.

We pushed hard the first day and made it to the Natch. If you've done any research on your route, you'll know the ones under it are grand. Best is the right one to the left of the cliff face, but it tends to get taken pretty early in the day though. Of the five around the Natch, the one to the south around the bend is by far the worst. Avoid if possible.

I really like the site at the NE of Whitson. Have camped on it a few times. None of the sites on Smith are particularly great (or if any are, it's back from the waterline). McManus is busier, but has nicer sites than Smith.

"> 1) Do you have a dedicated solo boat or do you paddle a tandem solo? If so what kind of tandem?

I paddle a 15' Swift Keewaydin Pack canoe. I've paddled solo in a regular solo canoe, and in the pack, and the pack is far easier to handle as a solo. Especially with a kayak paddle (though, as has been mentioned, you need a pretty long one for a pack canoe).

> 2) Do you single or double carry portages?

I single all my portages. On a 10 day trip, my pack comes out to ~60lbs with food, so with the canoe, paddle, lifejacket, etc. I'm carrying ~100lbs (over half my body weight). Be aware of what you can carry when making this decision, though. If you're contemplating single carrying, definitely recommend going around the neighbourhood with everything to see how it feels.

> 3) Do you use a single blade or double blade paddle?

As mentioned, I use a double blade. I find it far easier to steer with, and it's worth it's weight in gold when it's windy on the larger lakes. I've put some kayak clamps on my yoke so I don't actually have to carry it on the portage, too. Single portaging everything with hands free is very nice.

"1. Always a dedicated solo boat when tripping solo. I've paddled a tandem boat solo many times but it's way less comfortable and efficient to paddle solo compared to a dedicated solo boat. If you've never paddled a solo boat before it will feel tippy at first, but you'll get used to it very quickly. It's also way more fun to paddle since each stroke has stronger influence / the boat is more maneuverable with each stroke
2. I double carry portages but that's because I'm a small guy and the full weight of all my gear including food, canoe, camera gear, etc. is more than 75% of my bodyweight. It's less about the boat you have (solo vs. tandem) and more about the total weight of your gear relative to your carrying ability. I've single carried while travelling solo before, but for my size relative to my gear weight, it's just not worth it. Although like u/Gunner22 you'll want to pay attention to the seat placement to make sure you can comfortably portage all your gear at once if you plan on doing single carries (but this largely depends on your pack size and shape as well).
3. Always a single blade. I brought a double blade on my first few solo trips and it definitely helped in windy conditions, but I much prefer paddling with a single blade and I'm at the point where I'm comfortable enough with a single blade in all safe paddling conditions.

">1) Do you have a dedicated solo boat or do you paddle a tandem solo? If so what kind of tandem?

I paddle a tandem prospector 15 solo.  I was looking at solo canoes, but after lots of test paddling I decided a prospector 15 was the best fit for me, regardless if I was going to be solo or not.


>2) Do you single or double carry portages?

Single.  Another reason why I bought a tandem.  If you have a full pack, single carry is very uncomfortable as your pack will push up on the seat while you portage, thus pushing the bow of the canoe down.

"If you're going on a weekend in the summer months and want to do an easy trip without too many portages, it's going to be hard to avoid the crowds.

Magnetawan to Ralph Bice or Little Trout is a good option with pretty lakes and lots of nice sites to choose from. It will be busy though.

Source to Bruce is good if you want something quick and easy, and you would have Bruce to yourself.

I really like Ragged Lake and think it would be a great choice. You're right that Smoke can get choppy but if you get on the water right after sunrise you'll avoid the worst of the winds and more importantly, the worst of the crowds.

Shall to Shirley is another good option with only one portage (though it's longer than the option options at 1km). Shirley won't be too busy with through traffic and has plenty of nice campsites, most with a beachfront, and they're spaced away from each other so there's a feeling of remoteness.

I mostly travel solo and have plenty of trip reports on my website [algonquinbeyond.com](https://algonquinbeyond.com) you can check out for some route ideas.

"The route is better done clockwise but there's no reason you can't do it the other way.

If you go counterclockwise you'll be doing the longest 3km portage on Day 1 with your heaviest load (all of the food weight), and then you'll be paddling west on Louisa against prevailing winds.

There's a steep incline at the Louisa end of the 1.7km so you'll be climbing that at the start of the portage and it will drain you for the rest of the trail.

Those are pretty much the only negatives, so it's really not a huge deal. If you have the luxury of choice, go clockwise, but if things are booked and counterclockwise is the only option, definitely still do it.

"This is all excellent advice. The one point I would make is that your paddling times while solo will vary greatly depending on weather. Much more so than tandem. You can get wind bound much more easily if you’re a novice (or even experienced for that matter). If it’s your first time solo plan a very manageable route.

"A kayak paddle helps for when the winds pickup. Personally I prefer one to a traditional paddle when out solo, just find it more efficient. 
Routes would depend on which access point you're willing to travel to. 
Safety recommendations: take your time, don't be in a rush. Plan an extra day in case you get windbound on a large lake or it's unsafe to cross it.  I'd recommend leaving the axe and hatchet at home, and just bring a small folding saw especially if you're accident prone like me.",t2_6zbi8,onceuponaninterweb,0,1646697470.0,0,t1_hzrtl4g,hzrtl4g,True,Pai467,t3_t925jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/t925jf/first_time_solo_canoeing_advice/,First time solo canoeing advice,/r/algonquinpark/comments/t925jf/first_time_solo_canoeing_advice/hzrtl4g/,2,r/algonquinpark,0,2
"I mostly solo trip, you can check out my trip reports for a lot of details re solo tripping: [algonquinbeyond.com](https://algonquinbeyond.com)

But to summarize some tips...

\- Paddling solo is very different than tandem, but it depends what type of boat you have or will be renting. You can paddle a tandem boat by turning it around and sitting in the front seat facing backwards (if the boat has a symmetrical design). But the boat is still likely longer and wider than a dedicated solo boat, and you won't be exactly centred, so overall you won't move as fast and you will have less control of the boat especially in windy conditions. If you can get a proper solo canoe, do that. It will feel more 'tippy' at first but you'll get used to it quickly

\- It's a good idea to bring a backup paddle, and if it's your first time and you aren't sure about your abilities, make one of your two paddles a double blade paddle. It will help you in windy conditions if needed

\- Lots of solo trippers are choosing 'pack boats' these days where you sit on the ground instead of an elevated seat, and you use a double blade paddle only. I personally do not like these but you can look into pack boats vs. regular solo boats and see which you prefer

\- Stay close to shore, especially in windy conditions. Doing a self-rescue with a flipped boat when you're by yourself is extremely difficult. You probably won't flip, but if you do, you don't want to be in the middle of a huge lake.

\- Once your gear is out of the boat and at the campsite, if you want to go for a paddle and there's any chance of it being windy on the water, make sure you add weight to the boat to help with control and prevent the wind from bullying you. Some heavy rocks and/or firewood in the bow and stern of the boat will do the trick.

\- Keep a GPS communication device on you at all times, ideally one with two-way communication. Not just in the boat but literally on your body somewhere. I personally use and would recommend an InReach Mini.

\- Assume you will be double carrying all of your portages. Even if you think you can single carry, plan your timing around double carrying. You don't want to plan a trip expecting to single carry, and once you're out there you find out it's not possible and you need to double carry, but now your route is way too long and not doable.

\- Give yourself extra buffer time for every single task. Setting up a tent, collecting firewood, prepping and cleaning dinner... everything takes longer when you need to do it by yourself. Until you get comfortable with all chores and know exactly how long it will take you, assume it will take 1.5x longer than normal.

\- I won't give route advice here because there are just so many options, but the trip reports on my website (linked above) should be some good inspiration and give you some ideas. Plus, you never mentioned how long your trip is going to be so no one can really give route advice without that info.

\- Always err on the side of caution. Always. Don't do any cliff jumping while swimming, don't try and be superman on the portages carrying your bodyweight worth of gear and end up injuring yourself, etc. You're by yourself and if something goes wrong, no one is there to offer immediate help. Be smart about everything you do.

\- Plan a rest day in the trip, or at the very least a couple really easy days. Take some time to appreciate the environment and being alone out there. It doesn't always need to be a constant hustle. Wake up for the sunrise and go for a paddle, stay up late to stargaze, etc. Those will be your favourite memories.

I'll probably take this comment and turn it into a blog post for my website with the amount I just wrote lol",t2_tpajv,sketchy_ppl,0,1646696679.0,0,t1_hzrrsfn,hzrrsfn,True,Pai467,t3_t925jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/t925jf/first_time_solo_canoeing_advice/,First time solo canoeing advice,/r/algonquinpark/comments/t925jf/first_time_solo_canoeing_advice/hzrrsfn/,39,r/algonquinpark,1,39

"Start small and spend enough time preparing the proper materials.  Find some decent sized logs to use as a base to start the fire on.  Then get your birch bark.  Then small branches (dead spruce branches work great).  Get a bunch of small sticks about the diameter of your index finger.  Then pieces that are slightly bigger.  Find a nice dead standing hardwood.  Cut it down and split it into appropriate sizes.  Dead standing is crucial because it doesn't absorb water so it won't be frozen.  Once you get the fire going good enough there should be no issue keeping it going.  It does take some patience to get it going well though.

I like to test my skills and see if I can get a fire going in the winter with just the materials around me and a ferro rod.

You can get your wood from the forest.  I wouldn't bother buying wood to carry in.  It's heavy and not needed.  You will need to get wood anyways because a bag won't be sufficient for 3 days.

I haven't done it personally but lots of people climb up the cliffs on Hogan for a view over the lake, so that could be a good rest day activity.

"On mobile but…I went to Camp Ahmek on canoe lake as a kid and did a lot of tripping in the park from 7-14 years old. Late 90’s early 2000’s. There were so many ghost stories they told about Tom Thompson and others. The scariest though were always about stairs in the woods. Tripping through the park and other wilderness sometimes you’d come across random sets of stairs in the middle of nowhere off a portage or game trail. All styles of stairs like they were just removed from a house. You were never, ever supposed to touch them. Stories ranged from getting bad luck or dying, haunted houses they used to be attached to where the inhabitants were eaten by bears or murdered etc. They were nothing but spooky stories until one day on a 7 day trip when I was about 11, this kid in my group climbed one. All the way to the top and jumped off. Everyone, even the councilors were a bit upset , freaked out and superstitious about him doing that. Well that evening while we made camp, that kid took an axe to cut some dead branches off a downed tree and he slipped and nearly cut his damn big toe off!! They had to duct tape the dangling toe on and one adult and the biggest kid tossed him in a canoe and paddled hard to the closest road to hitch hike to a hospital while the rest of us stayed with the one other adult. Never saw the kid again. I kind of blocked out the memory until a few years ago when there was series of posts on r/nosleep where a search and rescue officer told some stories including one about random stairs in the woods.

"We hiked for about 6 hours along the western uplands trails in late fall. We started later in the day and barely made it to our camp site. We arrived at our site about 30 mins after sunset. I was extremely exhausted, wet and chilly. The first thing we did was pitch our tents. The two other guys I was with finished up before me and went scrounging for wood.

I went about  laying my sleeping mat and bag in the tent. I turn around to reach into my backpack to get my flashlight to make sure everything was set up properly and I point it at the head of the sleeping bag and I see this face staring at me with a wide eye smile.

"It's almost impossible to say what the water will be like on the day you go. 

I haven't done that specific trip, but have done plenty of paddling in Georgian Bay near the French river as well as further south.  

Georgian Bay is big water, and the winds can whip up pretty rough water, even in relatively sheltered areas.   That being said, some days can be like glass. 

So I think that trip is easily do-able.  If you're experienced paddlers, then I think you'd be fine, just allow for some flexibility in routes and stay on shore if the wind is really bad.",t2_t9oef,satchmo780,0,1644789994.0,0,t1_hwtz8f5,hwtz8f5,True,alanmudge,t3_srsqs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/srsqs4/killarney_experience/,Killarney experience?,/r/algonquinpark/comments/srsqs4/killarney_experience/hwtz8f5/,8,r/algonquinpark,0,8

"I recommend it. Spent a fair amount of time there this summer during a 3 week trip. It’s a nice “town”. I had an injury and was helped by Jake at Brent outfitters. Rangers are nice and friendly. There are people who live there, I think they’re leases? That means there’s motor boats but it’s no issue at all. There is a public dock and a nice beach. I recommend renting a canoe if you’re not bringing one (can paddle and stash it at your site) Check out the mouth of the nipissing, good opportunity to see moose in the weedy shallows and marsh.

"Have you thought about a park other than Algonquin? 
Kawartha highlands is great, I did my first backcountry there a couple summers ago from the bottle lake access point. They have campsites right on the lake, and you can portage deeper if you want. We went swimming on our campsite but it’s not a beach, just rocky. I believe some sites on the end of the lake have small beaches which might be good. 

There’s also Bon Echo, which is probably a bit busier but has more sites on the lake. I’ve never been so I can’t comment on the swimming part of it or the how busy it is. 

I really did enjoy Kawartha highlands as a first trip so keep it in mind. Also you book the specific site you want instead of the lake like Algonquin.

"Almost every lake will be good for swimming, it's the specific campsite that matters more. Since campsites are first-come-first-serve on a given lake, it's kind of impossible to answer the question. Rock Lake for example has paddle-in campsites (ie. no portaging) and some of them will be great for swimming, but some others may not. 

If swimming is your main priority I'd recommend choosing a lake like Rock Lake where there are plenty of campsites, as you'll likely find one available that suits your needs.

It also depends where you're coming from. If you want to start a trip from Hwy 60, Rock Lake is your best option for the reasons I mentioned, considering that Canoe Lake, Smoke Lake, Cache Lake, and Source Lake (some of the other access points off Hwy 60) all don't have campsites on them so you'll need to do at least one portage.

"Access 2 into Rosebary and the surrounding area for 2 nights is a good one.

Access 8, 2 night loop out of Cache through Harness, Pardee, Phipps, Delano etc. back to Cache. 

Access 9, Rock, Louisa, Penn, Rock

Access 1 offers some short loops from North Tea into Lost dog, sisco, lorne.  Or you could grab a site in the west arm of NT and do some day tripping.

Access 9 Rock to Penn or Clydegale, then Galeairy and back out through Rock.  Very historical area, busy in the summer but beautiful none the less. 

Access 3 into any of the surrounding lakes, Bice, Little Trout, Queer, etc.  I would suggest Paddling into Queer night 1, then port down to little Misty and head to Daisy for night 2.  This area has become very popular but for a reason, beautiful area. 

Don't let anyone convince going south of 60 is any less good than the more Northern access points.

"Yes and no on the snow shoes.

On the way in there was a trail that was pretty packed down by previous Hikers.  It was rather thin, and snow shoes may or may not have been good.

On the way out, a groomer had gone by on some of the trail, which fluffed up the snow a fair amount and made it a little more difficult for travel.  Snow shoes would have been helpful here.

"Hey there.

It went well! A good time was had. 

I don't have the exact list of sites we stayed at on hand, but we did start at Access Point 22 and leave via Squirrel Rapids. I think I'd recommend that, because Barron Canyon is very nice. If you really wanted to come and go from the same place, I'd say make that near Squirrel Rapids. 

All this said, the amount of Portaging on one of our days hit our limit. We were 4 guys in our 30s, and the day of the most portaging was also the day it rained.

"If they are all ambitious and can handle adversity and paddling/portaging in bad weather without it ruining their trip,  then you should be good.

If they are hesitant to that prospect then less camp moves make it a lot easier to keep the trip fun and comfortable for inexperienced campers if you do run into that rainy weather.

"Don't take this the wrong way as I'm totally not trying to be an elitist or anything and just want to give you the best recommendations, but how experienced are you with a canoe route like this yourself? 

Dry bags aside, with all the other stuff you need to bring everyone else is going to need a pack of some kind, so it's probably an easier arrangement just to have everyone carry their own stuff plus spreading of the shared items.  If you want to keep the dry bags separate in another large dry pack for double insurance, it really depends on your gear and how much stuff you are putting in dry bags. If it's just an emergency pair of clothes for everyone sure. If you are trying to cram everyone's clothing and sleeping bags in there then probably not.

September weather can be anything really, hot and dry, or rainy and quite cool. If you run into multiple days of rain and cool weather and have to tear down and set up camp multiple times in that weather, you better have a plan and the right gear to keep sleeping pads, bags and clothing dry or it's going to get miserable fast.

"I don't think it's the best route, especially for first-timers. I would choose lakes with nicer campsites and more expansive views, it's more likely to impress people if it's their first trip. Start from #3 just north and loop from Mag > Ralph Bice > Little Trout > Queer > Little Misty > Daisy > Mag

There's only one long portage but if you can snag a reservation on Little Misty, then you can take your time on the portage because you know exactly which campsite you're getting (only one permit on the lake).

Something like Little Trout x2 > Little Misty > Daisy. A mix of travel days and rest days is great for first-time trippers to really let them enjoy the peacefulness of the park. You can always day trip on the rest day if you want to explore, or just relax around camp.

Ralph Bice x2 > Daisy x2 would be a really easy option that would be good for first-timers as well.

"There's lots of good advice here so I'll keep it to a minimum.

First aid knowledge and supplies are really not optional for backcountry camping. Prepare for the worst.

For a first-time trip, ten people seems like way, way too much — considering that no one in the group has experience. I would *strongly* recommend building your skills and gear with a smaller, more manageable group before undertaking a large trip like this. I have over twenty years of backcountry experience and I would still be very, very hesitant to travel with such a large group, even if it was only a minority who had no experience.

I can't speak to the hiking sites, but 9 is the maximum number of people who are allowed to stay on any paddle-in backcountry sites.",t2_b9795,eachfire,0,1642434646.0,0,t1_ht1sj0f,ht1sj0f,True,[deleted],t3_s64mhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/s64mhg/first_time_backcountry_camping_tips/,First time backcountry camping.

"Other advice, coming from a Scouter - you're going to want to divide yourself up into smaller groups/teams for food and cooking. Large stoves are not practical for backcountry camping. With 10 people, you might want to do 5 groups of 2, each with a jetboil type stove, or you could maybe do 4 groups (2 of 3, 2 of 2), each with a small stove. If you have something like a dragonfly stove (bigger jet type stove) you can cook for 4 people, BUT then you'll need bigger (and bulkier!) pots.  


Agree with others on water - I personally like gravity filters, but you do need to have some time to let them do their thing. You can also get filters that fit on water bottles (Lifestraw makes one that fits on a Nalgene and a few other brands) and then have a couple packets of aquatabs as a backup. You should ALWAYS have two methods of water purification on hand.  


Also, with a group that size doing a backcountry hike, I would HIGHLY recommend that you have at least 1-2 people with some first aid training and that you carry a decent size first aid kit and a basic supply of common meds (benadryl FOR SURE, chewable aspirin in case of heart attack, basic pain/fever relief like ibuprofen, and then immodium/pepto). Think about the most likely things to happen on a hike - twisted ankles, scrapes, infected bug bites, burns, sunburn, heat exhaustion, etc. - and make sure you have some supplies for those. BTW, nuun electrolyte tablets are awesome for dehydration and also make (filtered!) lake water taste better.  


I could go on, but others have shared lengthy lists, but as someone who spends most of their time before trips thinking about what could go wrong and how to react if that thing does go wrong, make sure you did a little advanced planning for different scenarios. Some sort of emergency beacon would be a good idea for a novice group of that size (most areas of the park have no cell service) - not 100% necessary, but a nice-to-have.  


And last, for food, remember that there are lots of foods available in grocery stores that are dried and shelf-stable. You just might need to repackage them - stuffing mix, instant mashed potatoes, ramen noodles, mac and cheese, freeze dried hashbrowns (costco!), just-add-water pancake mix, beef jerky, shelf-stable pepperettes, oatmeal, powdered milk, instant coffee etc. You don't have to just get the pricey foods from MEC. For backpacking, you'll want to look at calories per ounce and only bring foods that are worth their weight. :)",t2_8oi5fgz3,grumpytocks,0,1642433771.0,0,t1_ht1qetg,ht1qetg,True,[deleted],t3_s64mhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/s64mhg/first_time_backcountry_camping_tips/,First time backcountry camping.

">what do we do about water?

Bring ""Aquatabs"" water tablets. You drop a tablet into your water, wait 30min, then it's safe to drink. Or bring a filter; there are tons of different options available if you search ""water purification"" on any of the major outdoors websites (MEC, Sail, Atmosphere)

"For that amount of people and first time backcountry camping I would highly recommend a gravity filter for producing drinkable water. People can get dehydrated easily, especially if consuming alcohol. Here are some options:  
[https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5035-528/GravityWorks-4-0L-Filter-System](https://www.mec.ca/en/product/5035-528/GravityWorks-4-0L-Filter-System)

A filter of this nature may seem expensive but is extremely valuable. If needed you could divide that price by 10 and get a really reasonable dollar per person ratio.

You should know that you likely won't have to poop while squatting in the bush unless en route. Most (if not all) campsites have a ""thunderbox"". Bring TP in a waterproof container. A Ziploc bag is easily accessible and lightweight. While travelling to your destination you can always stop at a campsite (preferably unoccupied) to use the ""thunderbox"".

If travelling by water, for a group of this size and without experience, I'd suggest choosing a single site to stay all three nights as opposed to a route where you stay at a different sites each night. If you want, day trips from a base camp will allow you to see more of the park. This is my preference when travelling with a big group. As you/the group gain experience, picking a route with multiple sites might become an option.

Lists! Make lists! Provide list to others. Forgetting things suck. The best way to make sure you bring the items you want is to make a list and check off as packing.

This is a great bannok recipe and video with instruction. A lightweight, fun option for meals.  
[https://www.greenmoxie.com/campfire-bannock-recipe/](https://www.greenmoxie.com/campfire-bannock-recipe/)

If anyone has initiative, it's very helpful to learn a few knots. Helps for bear hang, setting up a tarp, tying canoe to a vehicle, etc. Not everyone needs to go to this effort but maybe someone in the group has interest. Knots to know would be: end of the line bowline, ,truckers hitch or modified truckers hitch, and a clove hitch.

"Its great you folks are interested in backcountry camping.

First and foremost, I recommend doing some reading beyond reddit and the internet. Pick up a copy of Kevin Callan's *The Happy Camper: Essential Guide to Life Outdoors*, which will cover all the basics you should know before you go.

To answer your questions:

* You can bring water purification tablets and/or a gravity filter. I usually rely on the tablets, but have also used a filter.
* I have a dehydrator and I dehydrate all meals before the trip, but you can buy freeze dried meals from MEC.
* In Algonquin, there are toilets called ""thunder boxes"" at every campsite. Its best to avoid pooping in the woods if you can (though sometimes on a portage, it has to happen)

Some tips:

* Read about bear safety. Its important to know how to hang your food/garbage at night, keep a clean campsite, and not have any scents in your tent (snacks, tooth paste, etc)
* Don't clean your dishes in the lake, clean them at your campsite and dump the food scraps in a hole in the woods far from your tents.
* If you're planning on canoeing, choose a very easy route for your first time. Maybe even stay at one campsite for all the nights 1-2 portages away from the access point.
* Ensure you are prepared for the weather. You should all have good rain gear, warm sleeping bags, etc.
* Bring a saw instead of an axe. With 10 people an axe is just an accident waiting to happen.
* ALWAYS leave the campsite cleaner than you found it.

10 people might make for a pretty hectic back-country trip. It should be noted that you're only allowed 9 people per site in Algonquin.

"When I went I set up my cot/tent combo (Teton XXL w/ quick tent - awesome system) I mounded snow around all sides to create an air space underneath and cut down on wind sucking out heat. I also used a wool blanket, with thermarest pad on top, and then my winter rated bag. Boiling water in an HDPE nalgene was still warm in the morning after -20 temps.

"The exact opposite is true here.  When in a hammock or a cot, the air gap between you and the ground is too big to retain any heat.  The heat circulates too much and is continuously pulling heat out of you and your sleeping system.

An underquilt creates a smaller air gap that is easier to heat up, with your body and that Boiled Nalgene bottle. This is what sleeping pads do on the ground, create a small air gap.

This site says exactly what you said about being off the ground as the ground pulls heat.  BUT only in the initial summary... it goes on to say you need 1. 2. 3....

"True, but I think the idea is that although you need the hammock pad and some basic insulation, it takes significantly less insulation than if you're in a traditional tent because the air between you and the ground is a terrible conductor (great insulator) compared to, you know, the ground. 

I've never hammock camped myself, but I did use a fold-up cot when I winter camped because of the same premise; to get me off the ground.

"Did Tim river last July and I’m also really interested in the spring conditions… Our trip went like this…
The water level was so low that everyone was turning back after the 2nd beaver dam on Tim river (after Tim Lake). I’m estimating about 6 inches of water above the mucky bottom at best. We were dragging bottom the whole way and it took 7 hours to “paddle” to Rosebary. Half of the time I was using my foot to essentially turn the canoe into a water scooter (like skateboarding the canoe down the river) There were 12 Beaver dam’s to cross, each one lowering the water level beyond. The bugs were bugs. We were 1 of 2 canoes to make through that weekend as everyone else had turned back. So we decided to stay at Rosebary and cut our trip short a few lakes.

That being said it was one of the best trips I’ve done in the park. The Rosebary beach is a small paradise. The campsite to the east of the beach is one of the best I’ve seen in Algonquin. We saw a Moose along the Tim near the beginning.

It wasn't a fun paddle and I personally would have no interest in doing the whole length. The Nipissing was a much better river to paddle IMO.",t2_913ms,PrimevilKneivel,0,1642268651.0,0,t1_hssghr3,hssghr3,False,AMGpower,t3_s4k72e,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/s4k72e/tim_river_may_conditions/,Tim River - May Conditions,/r/algonquinpark/comments/s4k72e/tim_river_may_conditions/hssghr3/,1,r/algonquinpark,0,1

You could do a Barron Canyon loop from Grand Lake. Most people do it in 3 days so making it a 4 day trip would make it a bit more relaxing .,t2_b4vquk8f,NefariousnessTop9029,0,1642264697.0,0,t1_hss6bl4,hss6bl4,True,rababoulou,t3_s4majo,https://www.reddit.com/r/algonquinpark/comments/s4majo/4_day_loop_recommendations/,4 day loop recommendations,/r/algonquinpark/comments/s4majo/4_day_loop_recommendations/hss6bl4/,9,r/algonquinpark,0,9
