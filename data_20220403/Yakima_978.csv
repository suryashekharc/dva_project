A lot of gun violence. Legends of the mythical hole come from those days. Eventually crack freakonomics collapsed, police funding came in, the last time a runner ran up to my car to see if i was there to buy drugs was 1982, the year after we moved to Yakima. It was like driving around on a different planet compared to now. 90s were bad, true, years in a row where the number of funerals for young men dying in the street peaked dramatically every August.

"Yakima's crime is due to there being a large number of poor people.  Yakima has a lot of wealth disparity and it's been that way forever.  It's because of the agriculture-driven economy.  We are one of the largest producers of Apples and Cherry's as well as Hops.  These are labor-intensive crops for very short periods of time.  So there have always been the rich fruit moguls and the poor field workers.  This drives the social-economic relationships in Yakima.  There are many other industries and businesses around, but ultimately, agriculture is what built and still defines the Yakima Valley.

"Hey there. Lived in Bend for 10 years (born and raised in Yakima). 

Yakima is much more spread out than Bend. “Yakima” consists of Yakima proper (I like to think of this as 48th to the Yakima River, some may see it differently), West Valley, East Valley, Union Gap, and Selah (actually separate towns just south and north of Yakima respectively). 

Since you’re most likely accustom to Bend “culture”, you’ll find a small bit of it here. With Yakima’s hop producers, microbrews are becoming more prevalent but still nowhere near Bend levels. Still, Yakima offers a slowly growing downtown which hosts several events throughout the spring and summer (you’ll get no festivals like Bend here though). 

Crime. Well, it ain’t Bend. But than again, Bend has a different kind of crime. Well hidden from the public eye since Bend is heavily reliant on tourism. Yes break ins happen here but they also occur in Bend. Violent crime is down (statistically) but you’ll get the occasional drive by / murder in the valley. 

As far as enjoying a drink in downtown Yakima and then walking about to see the historic buildings say, after 7 pm… meh, I wouldn’t. Like Bend, Yakima has a growing homeless / mental illness issue they are currently working on (Camp Hope east of town is one of a few potential solutions which is helping to alleviate this issue). 

All in all, Yakima isn’t too bad. It’s home for me. The schools from what I know are decent. 

Don’t get me started on the food. Yakima food is so so. Bend is awesome. I miss me some Pho Viet, Noi Thai, Jackson’s Corner. Ugh!",t2_5emdiot9,YAK_ASSASSIN,0,1647316741.0,0,t1_i0pj3g6,i0pj3g6,True,Accomplished-Seat142,t3_te9lrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yakima/comments/te9lrz/new_to_the_area/,New to the area,/r/Yakima/comments/te9lrz/new_to_the_area/i0pj3g6/,13,r/Yakima,0,13
"It’s nothing like Bend. At all. The only similarity is the population size.

There is a new YMCA with a very nice pool but it’s often very crowded. 

There is a long “Greenway” multi use bike path, but it follows the highway and is lined with homeless camps

It’s close to good skiing (White Pass) and decent mountain biking (Rocky Top, Cowiche Canyon)

It’s a very close to some great wineries. Several breweries in town, a couple are actually good.

There is a small downtown core with some decent restaurants and bars. 

It’s not like Bend in that the new development in Yakima is in the West Valley. The downtown isn’t being improved much, despite local efforts. There is no outside money investing in Yakima, unlike in Bend

Bend has its unhoused. Yakima has more. And more drugs, gangs, drive by shootings, homicides. 

As another person mentioned, there are problem areas and you can avoid them. Look for housing in the west part of the city or surrounding towns.

"It's not like Bend. It's a decent sized city, but has mostly big box stores. Although it has a cute few blocks downtown and there are definitely some up and coming breweries. 

Otherwise, it's heavily an old agriculture town full of poor republicans. Sorry for the opinion, but I bet the census would back that up. 

That being said, I would say it's becoming more like Bend then less like Bend. 

There are actual gangs and dangerous parts so learn those areas ASAP when you get there and you'll probably never come into contact with crime other than reading about it. 

It has tremendous outdoor opportunities and the ability to make that into a fantastic place to live.

">with how people tip around here

I was amazed at how many non tip orders come up.  I always wondered how anyone could get top dasher status here in Yakima since there is no way I could keep 70%  or above unless I was accepting non tip orders. I started talking to other dashers and noticed that almost all of them were retired age people and they accepted every single order. $3 non tip order for the outskirts of Moxee? They accept those. $4 non tip order from Yakima Ave to North Selah? Yep they accept those too. I declined a Rinconcito order for $3 for 6 miles going to north Selah but got another (decent) order from Rinconcito a few minutes later.

"It's been pretty bad(for profit and minimum wage) since February.  It's a hit and miss thing depending on what you're wanting to accomplish.  I'm not top dasher because I choose not to work for under minimum wage per hour, I get around 3-4 orders offered every half hour on a regular weekday. I'll have to make $18 an hour running at $1 a mile at the end of the run to have made $13 hr I get to keep(after taxes and expenses) and with how people tip around here I'm not even able to see it as a reliable part time job.

"I'm not super familiar with apartments between 16th and 40th. But if you look at Craigslist there may be some nice couple renting out their basement or something like that.

Apartments are tough to find. Yakima has a vacancy rate of 1% right now. The apartments owned by the Borton's are probably the nicest in town. Probably a long waitlist, but worth calling and asking. They are nice and most of them do 6 month leases. Check em out at RentYakima.com

Have you checked with hospital admin? They might be able to help you find housing.

Bad things happen in Yakima. This is true. It is not Ellensburg. However, I also think this town is not as bad as it used to be, but the stigma remains. The police dept has a crime map, murder map, and DV map you can look at to get a feel for which areas are higher crime than others. Ask your coworkers when you get here for tips on where to go and what to do. You can PM me, too, if you want more specific advice about which areas of town to avoid or check out.

"Randall park is full of pedestrian traffic, it's pretty open, but they've done what they can.  It plays fast and pretty easy, provided you aren't waiting on pedestrians.

Most holes in Fulbright are in the wide open and it has several in the back under a freeway overpass.

You can play River Ridge in Selah for $5, but you have to schedule a tee time, the course isn't very well marked and ball golfers will play regardless of whether they will hit you or not.

Mostly, Disc Golf in Yakima is disappointing in my opinion.  It would be really cool if they developed Rotary Lake or Sportsman to have a nice course.  The others work, but are somewhat disappointing.  I suppose it depends on what kind of disc golf you enjoy and what you are used to.

There are too many variables for a good answer. Depending on how far from existing power line you might just need cable to a masthead. If you gotta drop a pole or multiple poles it can get expensive fast. Which part of the yakima valley are you looking at putting a well in?  Some areas are restricted from having new wells. Flat lowland on Ahtanum might have a 50 foot well and do fine.  Out a bit and on a hill? 300-500 feet to good water. The last well my parents put in was $30k….

"I lived on the east coast (Connecticut) for two years for Grad school. Welcome!

Yakima is a small city with a very small town feel.

Downsides for me:
It's really conservative, which isn't in line with my beliefs.
Crime isn't low. I see people scared you about gangs. Live in a safe area and I've literally never once had a problem. We have had theft issues (things stolen from our carport, something stolen from our car when we accidentally left it unlocked). Nothing major. The type of stuff you'd honestly find anyway.
There isn't as much to do in town as there are in other cities.

Pros:
There may not be a ton to do in town, but we are only 2.5 hours from Seattle, 3.5 from Spokane. So many outdoor activities. Hiking, skiing, and the skiing is AMAZING.
Housing is reasonably priced compared to other areas.
We have great weather imo. Though it is really hot I in the summer.

Seriously don't let people scare you. Yakima has a bad reputation. It isn't bad.

"Selah; housing non existent and expensive.. VERY conservative...BIG Trump/Fox news town. 

Naches, Gleed, Moxee Selah are small communities. Whole area is mainly agricultural:: Culture shock is a big factor here if move from a Metropolitan area. there is a community College and several""trade""schools and D.O. medical school i  Terrace Heights ( suburb east of downtown.)

Big Hispanic population and great Mexican food.   However only 4-5 ""gourmet"" restaurants in whole Valley.

Yakima Valley produces 70%of ALL Hops in USA;  Apple also big crop, some ch3rries, grapes for wine production...Great hunting, fishing country and one hour to Mt Rainier National Park

Last spring & summer there were DAILY killings, mostly downtown area  described by some posters as ""bad"" areas and drug related. .several.""drive-by"". one outside convenience store,  Seem to be lots ""car break-ins"" not just in downtown area...

I'm told the school system is good especially in West Valley ,Naches and Selah.

Weather; definitely 4 seasons..HOT  in Summer:  and snow in winter..Related to""snow"" --not a lot but does cover the ugly sage brush on adjacent hills. Frustrating factor for me is that snow often closes the 2 mountain passes that allow access to Seattle area (What locals call ""West Side"".)

"There are many good places to live nearby.

Ellensburg is a beautiful city. The downtown is very walkable and has great restaurants. It is very close to outdoor activities and the scenery is gorgeous. The college ensures there is plenty of youthful energy in the town, lots of musical events, and theater to attend. Jobs are a little thin unless you can work for the college. Best time of my life was living there.

Selah has some very nice views, a well respected school system, and is so close to Yakima that one almost runs into the other. Selah Heights has views to die for.

West Valley has been suggested by many and I agree. Their schools are rated well and it is beautiful. It doesn't have it's own downtown though so there is zero entertainment options unless you are willing to drive into town.

Yakima itself has some nice areas. The rule of thumb used to be anywhere west of 16th avenue but these days I'd say it's further west. We've been seeing some shootings even as far west as 72nd which is disturbing. Yakima's school system scores very low so that is an issue if you have children.

"Exactly this. My husband and I grew up in this area, moved for school and then moved back as young professionals. It's pretty hard to find another area with decent jobs where I could buy a house, be close to mountains and have access to amazing quality, local beer and wine! I miss night life of bigger cities, but aside from that we have maker spaces, great coffee, two farmers markets, several breweries and wineries. I love the contrast here. The dry hills contrasted with the lush hop fields. The industrial blocks contrasted with the spacious arboretum. The blistering heat of summer and the sleepy freeze of winter. It's a great place to live but there's a leftover narrative from decades ago that people play on repeat.

"I missed yesterday I guess. I love it here - so does our extended family. I grew up here, moved away, and have come back. It’s a fabulous place for families - we’re 3 to 4 hours to Seattle, Portland, and Spokane. There’s air service here or in Pasco (just about an hr away). We’re an hour from the mountains & snow skiing/boarding, and an hr from any lake you wanted to water ski at. There is world class fishing less than 30 min away. So much hunting, hiking, camping, etc. Mount Rainier is just an hour & a half away!! The ocean is a long drive but I’ve been crazy enough to make it a day trip (it was a long day and I was itching to go). Don’t believe everything you read. Every area has its pros and cons, life is what you make of it. Housing is inexpensive if you can buy, the rental market is tight and spendy (like you’d find in a bigger city); but our taxes are low, utilities are really inexpensive, and it’s sunny 300 days a year!!

"I lived in Yakima for five years and the small town vibe is there. They fly the flag there if you know what I mean… Proudly. 

It’s a mainly white and Hispanic city with plenty of field work if your into that. The hourly wage is lower as well as every thing else compared to Seattle. 

I enjoyed the nights there especially…so quiet and peaceful. You could yell and feel like your disturbing the peace.

"In fairness comparing most of Mass to Central WA isn't a fair comparison given the difference in population density. Yakima is a fairly small city compared to basically all of Mass. So the things that come with that simply don't exist, sometimes because people haven't been motivated to do so (meetup groups) and sometimes because there just isn't enough people interested.

I moved around a bit, started a few meetups to help fill needed gaps and it was a great way to make friends. Haven't done so here mostly because I'm in a different space of life and then covid on top of that.

I'd say cities like Yakima have less established to take advantage of but at the same moment plenty of opportunities to create your own adventures. Like you I also haven't felt unsafe, there are bad areas for sure, but I also don't go out for night life often these days either so it's not saying much.

So, really my tips for moving to a less population dense area is to put a greater effort to get yourself out there and meeting others.

"I moved to Yakima from Massachusetts. 

Pros: 
MUCH lower housing costs, very easy to get a job, exceptional outdoor recreation activities close by. 

Cons: 
Extreme heat/smoke in summer (I never encountered wildfire smoke on the East Coast— it fucking sucks).  

Winters are cold but not as snowy as New England (it is a desert after all). They consider a few inches to be a huge snowstorm here. I like snow, so I put that in the con category. 

Social activities seem almost nonexistent compared to the places I lived back east. I have yet to find active boardgame groups, running clubs, book clubs, etc.

"It all really depends on what you're looking for, what your interests are, etc. My wife grew up in Yakima and I always made the joke that I'd never move here, but when housing prices went up on the Westside of the state and family came back to Yakima, it suddenly made sense.  

The cons are definitely that it's a city with a small town feel. For the size and population of Yakima, it really lacks some things I'd expect of a place it's size. The city also has some seedy parts to it, but doing some quick research will let you know where to avoid (like any city). The education system is fine, but not great. As others have stated, the housing costs are going up but that's unavoidable anywhere you go. 

The benefits are that it's close to great hiking, camping, fishing, outdoors stuff. There are plenty of sports leagues (although finding them and signing up can be a struggle), the spring and summer are wonderful, the beer/wine scene is great, the downtown has had a resurgence, and it's a 20 minute drive from one side of Yakima to the other.

"I remember writing a letter to the editor of the YHR about the lack of recycling in Yakima...in 1999.

You can take some recycling to the church near 48th and Chestnut.

Apparently the Terrace Heights landfill has it, but it is/was convoluted. After our wedding reception I got my dad to take all the cans to their recycling.

Also: a dirty little secret of the recycling industry is that even municipalities which allow for glass collection (which are fewer and fewer) will still sometimes send glass to the landfill. Especially if it’s single-stream collection.

Other than that the naches, tieton, and Yakima are full of great spots. You can find great holes every hundred yards in all of them.

They said he had to take each can/bottle and feed it through a little hole in the bin. They had to do it this way so people wouldn't throw trash in. He asked them if they could just take it and showed them the insides of the bags. Nope, he had to do each one. He naturally said ""no"" and threw the bags back in his truck and dumped them with the regular garbage.

"I was born in Toppenish and grew up in Union Gap (basically apart of Yakima). I’m Mexican and can tell you we have a huge Mexican population over the whole Yakima Valley and the culture shows depending on the neighborhood you go. Drive 6 minutes from your home in Terrace Heights and you will be in the east side of Yakima where there are carnecerias (Mexican meat/butcher shops) & panaderias (pastry shops) everywhere, you’ll find the best tasting meats and pastries in town inside of those shops. I love heading up to Little Naches, Rim Rock or bumping lake. It’s badass have having nice evergreen forests 35 minutes away from our comfortable, sometimes hot, desert hop-country. Good restaurants range from “Atmospheric” to “greezy yet super delicious” .. they include Norms, Cowiche Canyon, Mels, Miners, Peppermint Stick, Xochimilco, Puerto Escondido, El Mirador, Old Town Station, Waffles Cafe, Tony’s Steakhouse, Last Frontier, Ozeki Japanese, Majors etc etc 

Also, We have a lot of country/rural areas around here.. so I usually just use my cousins property to shoot guns 😎 FYI Bi Mart has very good prices on anything from a HiPoint to Glocks depending on what they have in stock lol we have a few of those stores in the Yakima Valley, so I like to shop around to the different locations before I buy anything firearm related 

Edit; a lot of spots on The Greenway have been overtaken by the homeless due to Camp Hope
Being placed on the greenway trail between Moxee & Yakima, just outside of the Arboretum.. last time I took my little brother fishing at the Union Gap spot, a homeless man kept screaming at us from across the pond.

"Do you know which area of town you will be living in?

As others have mentioned there is a nice indoor gun range.  The Range. https://www.therangellc.com. There are also some areas you can do outdoor shooting but there are limits due to weather, fire danger etc. 

Both dog parks mentioned are basic but fenced and near other green spaces. The west side one is Randal dog park and it’s adjacent but not connected to the neighboring city park by the same name. Randal park has a large field, walking path, and climbing toys in 2 locations. It also has a pond with ducks year around and is very natural feeling. 

Yakima has an extensive biking/walking trail called the Greenway. https://www.yakimagreenway.org/map  it is great for daytime as a family. There are areas with homeless so I would say be cautious in regards to unaccompanied minors or individual ladies. I never  have trouble but I’m a big dude. 

The surrounding has lots of hiking and biking. I like the Cowiche canyon trails as they are 5 minutes away from town. https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/cowiche-canyon. 

As others have said the mountains due west have lots of activitites. White pass ski resort, Rimrock and Clear lake, camping and fishing etc. lots of things to do with the family. 

It’s a red area for sure. Heavy agricultural history and that’s the primary industry still. Generally speaking I find most people are good, with outliers on both ends of the spectrum.

"There are some great providers in Tri-Cities. I have an ongoing hand issue after a bad break.  Kadlec has been accommodating and very helpful to work with.  I personally came from Seattle Ortho after a fracture repair, several surgeries to clean that up, a stint of poor/misdiagnosis and frustration with a side order of chronic pain.  This was a very easy transition referral wise, and it’s been leading to very obvious (positive) results.  Looks like Cigna is widely accepted/highlighted as well. 

Could be a good option to explore. Best of luck as back pain is exceptionally annoying and painful.  I hope you find some relief.

Orthopedics Northwest is pretty much the only show in town and they are through Memorial so I would assume they are in network for Cigna but I'm not sure. They have several doctors there. I've seen Rue and Kennedy for knee issues but you probably won't get either of those for back stuff. They were both ok but I wouldn't say I recommend either of them.

"You have a few options.

Spectrum - Probably the best choice for most of Yakima. Speeds up to a gigabit which is nice. This is what I have currently and I haven't had any problems in the last couple of years.

Centurylink - I'd avoid this unless you live somewhere that offers their fiber service. Their DSL is so-so and really depends on where you live.

Fixed wireless providers - Theres a few of them here and this is a last resort. I would shop around for places to live and take this it as a major downside if this is the only internet available for the place you want to move into. 

Starlink - Its a great alternative if you are out in the sticks.

Nope.  My mum and dad were here for 30 years plus.  But I was away from WA for 25 years or so and only just moved back with my own family.  So now we are all here.  I personally never did live in thus area. Grew up on the west side of the mountains but visited here a lot as a kid.,t2_cksm1mtu,theurbanpoppy,0,1636494126.0,0,t1_hjzldjh,hjzldjh,False,theurbanpoppy,t3_qoh6oe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yakima/comments/qoh6oe/new_here/,New Here,/r/Yakima/comments/qoh6oe/new_here/hjzldjh/,1,r/Yakima,0,1
