"That's so cool.  I know a retired dentist whose office was in there.  It was rough before they closed it down apparently.

Hope they can get in touch with the top floor owner: Floors one through 15 of the building were purchased by VIPA Hospitality Management, a company founded by Patel’s father, Dr. Vijay Patel. They were unable to secure ownership of the top 16th floor due to no response from the owner, but are hopeful to acquire it in the future.

"For food: Diablos for Mezcal, SQZBX & Grateful Head for pizza & beer, both are good dine in locations, but we enjoy sitting on the outdoor patio on side of mountain at grateful head. Rockys Corner for Italian/American & Sports bar, Fishermans wharf for seafood, and we like Freddys for on the go. Little Italy for real Italian. Arlington hotel has a good buffet for brunch & then dinner with good seafood & crab legs i think on select Sundays.
Experiences: Petting zoo/alligator farm is close by bathhouse row. Cheap, quick, and cool walk through, and owner is a cool dude involved with all animals. Bathhouses famous for spa/massages. Gangster museum & wax museum are cool for a one time thing but expensive for experience imo. Skip the duck tours. Going up in the observation tower is a good experience if not cloudy/foggy. There is a Shortest St. St. Patricks parade on i think the 16th or 17th is a pretty cool event. Staying at the arlington is an experience in itself if not yet made travel reservations. Has a mountain side pool and hot tub if in season. 
Hiking: Walking trails behind bathhouse row for quick hike & easy access. I agree with above user north woods park has nice trails & nearby Hot Springs National park access areas have some small trails next to a creek/river, and one up a mountain thats challenging but has a big cave and look over. Lake Catherine has some more difficult hiking trails, and there is one that leads to a small waterfall area. You can either hike the way that is somewhere around a mile and some change & up and down a good bit, or the other trail that is half a mile with less elevation to reach it easier. Lake Ouachita is also a beautiful park on the lake, but the water was a little low last time we went. Still beautiful and worth seeing. In season & i believe it may be just starting you can rent kayaks, paddle boats, and pontoon boats for real cheap and explore around the bay in Lake Ouachita. We like to tent camp there on the peninsula & do so. 
Shopping: Lots of lil shops on bathhouse row. Souvenir shops etc. Everything is expensive being its a tourist location. We have a sweet tooth & like the sugar shoppe even though overpriced. Love the macaroons. Its about rocks for crystals/souvenirs owner is cool.

"If you like beer, then you have to try Superior Bathhouse Brewery. 

North woods park has fantastic hiking/biking trails. If you hike them, watch for bikers in both directions and stand to the side to let them pass. 

Lake Catherine State Park has really scenic trails with lake views that are hiking only. Not the most challenging, but great if you are looking for peace, quiet, and relaxation. 

Lots of shopping options all over the city, but downtown has some really fun options, and it’s completely walkable so feel free to park your car and explore everything.

Some of the bathhouses are museums that can be toured, Lamar Bathhouse has a gift shop, Quapaw and Buckstaff baths are in operation, and Fordyce bathhouse has the visitors center. 

Do take time to walk the grande promenade. It’s not a challenging hike or anything, but the view of bathhouse row is fantastic, and it’s in general super fun. 

Oaklawn racetrack is also a ton of fun, whether you prefer horse racing or casino gambling. Seats can be ordered online, and are only $5 per seat. Free admission.

And I know there’s a fishmonger in LR, but I’ve never been and haven’t even called. But I’m guessing that’s gonna be the *best* option of the three.
For what it’s worth, I do know farmed salmon and tuna should generally be okay to eat raw. That doesn’t mean the quality is what you’d want… I also have a 4 year old, so I’m more cautious than if it were just me and my husband.

"Sure! I'm a realtor out there. 

Basically you have two options: you can call and fill in wherever Members haven't already, or you can become a Member and set up your time easier and for cheaper. The rates typically split in half so, random numbers, a guest's 9-hole round might be $40 and a Member's would be ~$20.

Its a bit of a mixed bag and all comes down to how much you golf. Say you own/buy a vacant lot, which you can buy cheap enough (~$3,000), well then you get a gate card, discounted rates, etc. However, you then pay $40/mo in POA fees until you sell the lot, on top of the discounted golf you play. You'll totally still save money even if you just golf a few times a month, however if you stop golfing as much, lots are hard to sell. 

4 Rounds ($80) + POA ($40) = $120

3 Rounds ($120) 

The vacant land lots are easy to buy/hard to sell because there's 2,100 of them or so and they're all fairly comparable. So you might be selling yours for dirt cheap and have a realtor who actually markets it (most don't), but after closing costs you will probably still owe a bit of money to the title company (~$500). 

Diamante is it's own separate animal and actually it's own corporate entity within the Village. They charge out the wazoo.

Thats the basics of it! I'm having trouble remembering off the top of my head if you can actually golf as a guest without having a Member be with you, and I'm thinking you can, but I'll update this tomorrow after I give them a call and ask.

my house (but downtown in general)

\-How easily accessible are the hot springs themselves? Which are your favorite?

they're not - at least not natural ones.  There are fountains and stuff downtown, and spigots where you can pour yourself a jug of yummy spring water (it's hot).

\-Are most park areas dog friendly?

yeah I think all of them are.  just keep it on a leash.  There's a dog park that's fenced in over on shady grove and hollywood where your doggo can run free.

"I lived in Hot Springs for 18 years and raised my daughter there. She left after high school and I moved to be closer to my job and my mom who has since passed. My daughter moved back about 6 years ago and still loves Hot Springs, but like everywhere else, it is not aa safe as it once was. I have considered moving back myself, but since staying in my childhood home after my mother passed, I am sentimental about moving. That said, I DO need a smaller place as This home is just too much for one person. I think you are the perfect age for Hot Springs. There is still a small town feel to the place, and so many interesting activities that you will not find anywhere else in the state. Lakeside Schools still has a great reputation on state rankings, but Lake Hamilton schools are also highly praised.  

You should go for a weekend and check out all the changes since you left. Plenty of Air B&B places either on the lake or downtown, and some really nice hotels downtown. The Waters is very nice. 

Hot Springs is probably one of the more liberal cities in Arkansas so I don’t think it would be a problem for you.

"Hands down the Lake Quachita Vista Trail. The debate would be which trailhead.

That's the full extent of it.  That, and saying *anything* to the mods when it happens.  They have a couple of children on the mod list, and their top mod is basically MIA, so you can fart on a Wednesday and they'll ban you.

That said, a post like that would get removed in r/LittleRock, because it has nothing to do with Little Rock, but your comment would not be removed, even though I don't like it.

"Thank you for all the input. I still want to be mainly MK Themed, but i could definitely throw in the latest consoles and let folks play what they want.   


# Here's the full idea:

When a guest walks in, they'll be greeted by Scorpion (Ed Boon) saying ""WELCOME!"" which is taken from that 1995 MK movie when Scorpion and Johnny Cage begin fighting. It will be adult oriented but kids ages 13+ are welcome to come play as there will be prizes for how far folks progress on a tower in any MK game. There would be 5 Tiers of prizes based on which tower they choose to play through.  


**Novice Tower** \- Winning half the tower then losing would award no prize.  Completing the tower would award a Tier 1 Prize.  


**Beginner Tower** \- Winning half the tower then losing would award a tier 1 prize, completing it would award a tier 1 or 2, guest's choice.  


**Champion Tower** \- Winning half the tower then losing would award a tier 1 or 2 prize. completing it would award tier 1-3 prizes.  


**Master Tower** \- Winning half the tower then losing would award tier 1-3 prizes. Completing it would award tier 1-5 prizes.  


There would be a rectangle bar in the center of the room, with a wall Separating it and the prize wall. Up against the prize wall would be the consoles - hopefully - a Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X. Here we would let folks pay the bartender to come behind the bar and play the consoles. (If you're worried about the smell of alcohol, don't be. The bar would be large enough to have the drinks at one side and the consoles at the other.)   


The installed games on the consoles would range from Mortal Kombat to even Spider-Man. Whatever someone wants to play it'll be installed. The games would rotate out based on what's popular but MK and Spider-Man would stay installed at all times. Putting the games here would give the adult guests something to watch. There would also be a television closer to where the drinks are and guests could watch whatever they like, just gotta let the bartender know and he'll change the channel.  


Tournaments would also be held at the arcade, and would take place on the consoles. If we are successful enough and get enough money, some of it could be put in the pot for the tournament, but there would be other prizes as well - such as winning a PS5 or Xbox. That is of course, depending on when this arcade gets set up lol - it could be a PS9 by that time for all i know LOL.  


Anywho  


Towards the back of the Arcade, I want to have a life size statue of Goro sitting on his throne, to add to the MK vibe. As for wallpaper, I'd rather have wall screens. You know those reflective pictures that change based on what angle you look at them? I would love to have those as a wallpaper if possible, and the picture would be that of Goro's Lair from the original Mortal Kombat, and walking through the arcade would make it seem like it's scrolling from left to right or vice versa.   


There will also be fountain drinks, and perhaps food. Likely Pizza and/or Burgers/Fries.   


Lastly - The music playing over the speakers would be the soundtrack to the first 3 MK games. If need be i'll have other arcade games, perhaps Street Fighter or something, but as I've said - the main focus would be MK. For every person who doesn't like it, there'll be another person who does :)",t2_pouzs,JockyRhonson,0,1638076475.0,0,t1_hmd7ayr,hmd7ayr,True,JockyRhonson,t3_r35nt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotSprings/comments/r35nt0/about_the_future/,About the future...,/r/HotSprings/comments/r35nt0/about_the_future/hmd7ayr/,1,r/HotSprings,0,1

"I know a lot of those “homeless junkies.” Most aren’t junkies, but most use drugs when available for the escape. First and foremost, they are people with mental health issues who don’t have places to turn. They have interesting and relatable pasts, very difficult tribulations that snowball and get worse and worse. By that I mean things like: losing an ID, trying to get a replacement ID but not having an original copy of their birth certificate, can’t get a birth certificate because they were born on an Alaskan military base and for whatever reason, it’s this whole thing requiring proof of identity without a freaking license, and trying to get by without a license. No job, no hotel rent, no pawning or selling to pawn shops. They are people who aren’t capable of taking care of themselves properly, but are otherwise oftentimes interesting, intelligent, insightful, incredibly kind-hearted. I get how it can seem, but I work where I interact with and am close with many homeless people in Hot Springs. And if I didn’t know them, I’d probably draw the same conclusion. But it’s unfortunately not as easy an issue as drug addiction. It’s mental health issues suffered by otherwise normal people like you and me.

Edit: not that addiction is easy, but that it’s easy to assume the homeless are choosing a life of drugs over safety, comfort, and stability instead of understanding that you could be in their shoes next year after a car accident and a traumatic brain injury.",t2_9qb9k,theswerve,0,1638069384.0,0,t1_hmctw2z,hmctw2z,False,[deleted],t3_py888j,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotSprings/comments/py888j/considering_a_move_to_hot_springs/,Considering a move to Hot Springs,/r/HotSprings/comments/py888j/considering_a_move_to_hot_springs/hmctw2z/,2,r/HotSprings,0,2

"My husband has always wanted to own a nickel arcade. I think an arcade with just MK would be rejecting a LOT of business. Especially that of kids and a good chunk of adults. My husband used to manage a mall arcade and both of use worked at video game stores for some time. I think most of the money an arcade makes these days is going to be from concessions. I don’t know if any local spots for rent off hand, but if you’re still saving, what’s available today likely won’t be tomorrow. I think the closer you get to bathhouse row, the more you could cash in on tourists. I don’t know if kids are as into games as they used to be (arcade specifically), so maybe catering to adults with good food and alcohol would be a better bet (with higher overhead).

"Despite what I say in this post, I personally love HS.

But....HS is a tourist town.  A resort town.

It is not a town with good jobs in clean production facilities, etc.

Take that however you wish and decide if that fits your needs.

I am visiting a city now up by the Great Lakes,  that has tons of really nice apartments  (about 20x nicer than anything HS has) (because it has tons of clean industry and lots of jobs);  people have $$ to spend and most everyone has a nice motor vehicle.   There are many county and state parkks, best dog park I have ever been to, fishing piers and bike paths.   The only problem is, it's cold in winter.

If would say if you are younger, and want to build your bank account the latter would be where to live.

Jobs in tourist towns like HS are mostly in the service/restaurant/retail industry and do not pay well.  Its a beautiful natural environment bu many of the young people I talk to here are struggling.

"Hahaha. Not too much to tell. A few weeks (months?) ago a body was found in National Park area.  There were fbi investigating and people were wondering if there was a serial killer around here.  The city released an official statement saying there was not. 

But I’m the sort that passes a certain house every day and has a little story about the people that live there. Or a car I see every day on the way to work, etc.  Back when my kids were young, a pawn shop type store near our house opened.  I’d tell the kids all about “Jim” and why he opened the store and what all he did. (Among other stories about other places and random people. They knew I just like to make up stories to pass the time while driving.).  So “Jim” and his family and the store they opened had all sorts of adventures over the next couple of years. The kids reached prime eye-rolling age and got tired of my stories over time.   One day we stopped in at the store to see if they had any cheap video games. None of us had ever been there but hey, we can’t afford new video games, maybe there are cheap ones. 

We walked in to look around just as a another person yelled out from the back “Hey, Jim, do you have any….”    The look on the kids faces was worth gold. 

Accidentally using the actual name of the owner bought me like 6 months of decreased eye-rolling.

"Heres a old post I made on a local forum:
Complaints about Resort internet seems to be a common theme here so I wanted to share my solution. I purchased instructions and a scrapped tablet IMEI off eBay here: 

https://www.ebay.com/itm/UNIQUE-AT-T-Unlimited-4G-LTE-Data-Account-ATT-20-month-YOU-OWN-IT/333824910602
 
If you already have a IMEI number from a old tablet you can message me and I’ll send you the rest of the instructions they sent with the email including the number to sign up for service.

You will also need a hotspot device. I went with the Netgear Nighthawk since it connects directly to standard WiFi routers for increased speed and spread.

It’s a bit of a pain to set up but the end result is reliable, unlimited internet ranging from 40-80mpbs with signal available all across the property. The cost is $20 a month when you choose autopay. So far I haven’t noticed any drawbacks compared to ‘traditional’ internet but your mileage may vary depending on how strong of a LTE signal your place gets.",t2_czyfg,NolaTyler,0,1634487973.0,0,t1_hh00hc7,hh00hc7,False,NutmegWolves,t3_q9ddup,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotSprings/comments/q9ddup/internet_providers/,Internet Providers?,/r/HotSprings/comments/q9ddup/internet_providers/hh00hc7/,1,r/HotSprings,0,1

"We moved here almost six years ago. We are Yankees. And liberal. It’s not a great fit for us. I disagree about HS high school - my kids are thriving there and attended Park and HSJA and 95% good experiences. We did transfer districts though, because we are in Cutter. There isn’t a lot to do, and restaurants burn out pretty quick. The weather is decent but the bugs are atrocious. It is fairly diverse here - at least for whites, blacks and Latinos. I don’t see a lot of other ethnicities. Some parts of town are sketchy, particularly those with low cost “starter homes”. I wouldn’t recommend Lake Hamilton - very white, very racist, very focused on football. Being an hour from Little Rock is nice for the airport (although not a lot of direct flights). You can fly out of Hot Springs to DFW (daily, I think) for about $100 round trip. There are not a lot of jobs here - my husband has been searching for a year and is stuck working for not a lot in the meantime. National Park community college is decent.

"Big List from another thread: 


Our best restaurants?

Budget and Must-Eat: McClard’s BBQ. Legendary and favorite of President Bill Clinton. Going for unusual? If you can handle spicy, get a tamale spread!

Splurge: 501 Prime. Taste of Home calls it the best steakhouse in the state. It’s expensive, but worth it. Looking for a cheaper option? Go for the Wednesday buck a shuck oysters or book at table at their Bourbon Bar (same cooks, cheaper menu.) Luna Bella is also great.

Best Bar/ Drinks: The Rooftop Bar at the Avenue Hotel has the best views of the city. Go after dark and get the old fashioned. The Ohio Club is the oldest bar in the state, and fabulous. They have great live music all the time. The Superior Brewery is the place for beer lovers—-it’s the only brewery in the US that uses thermal water.

Music: Arlington lobby on Saturday nights, or Maxine’s. Also check the city website to see what events might be going on when you’re here. Oaklawn Casino hosts concerts now, too.

Best pizza: SQUZBX. People will tell you that Deluca’s is the best. Don’t trust them.

Best for families: Mid America Science Museum, Garvan Woodland Gardens, Magic Springs and Crystal Falls Amusement Park, Fordyce Bathhouse Museum, Mountain Tower, our many lakes and camping areas.

Best of the National Park: Gulpha Gorge, Promenade, Bathhouse Row. Be sure to check out the free museum in the Fordyce! West Mountain overlook after dark. See if any guided ranger hikes are available when you’re here, as well.

Best Brunches/Breakfasts: Arlington Sunday Brunch is a splurge, but amazing. Best Court Cafe is incredible. Pancake Shop (fresh food, local meats) is the best overall (both in quality and price), but get there very early or you won’t get a table. You may have a wait a bit—-but I promise it is worth it.

Best Food Trucks: Try the 420 Food Truck Court for a huge selection of amazing food trucks. Outdoor dining.

Best Mexican: Quetzal. Bonus points for their adventurous, authentic menu. Order something unusual here—-you won’t regret it. Capo’s Tacos is not super authentic, but they have good tacos and excellent margaritas.

Don’t Waste Time/Money On:

The Duck Boats. Big tourist trap, very expensive, very hot, very crowded. The tour guides usually have incorrect information, and the Duck boats are a safety hazard. People have literally died on them.

The Ghost Tour: The dude is a hack and will tell you lies. If you want ghost stories about Hot Springs, message me and I’ll give you better ones for free.

Best Italian: Mama’s Little Italy or Angel’s.

Best Downtown Shops: The Bathhouse Soapery is a can’t miss for people who love to pamper themselves. They have homeade bath products that are phenomenal. The gift shop at the Ozark Bathhouse has lots of great local books. Mamoo’s Paradise Ice Cream is homeade and so good.

For Art and Craft Lovers: check out the many art galleries downtown, or book a day at one of our many painting studios.

Best Coffee Shop: Red Light Roastery, hands down. They have weird hours, but they’re a can’t miss. They roast their own beans and have delicious homeade treats. A close second place is Kollective Coffee. Still great, but not as great as Red Light.

Best Places to Enjoy the Water:

Bring your own glass bottles to the pump by the Lamar Bathhouse. Scorching hot spring water—-delicious and free.

For the grownups, you can soak all day at the Ozark Bathhouse’s communal pools for only $24. Spots fill up fast though, so get there right when they open. Bring cash for snacks and drinks. BYO swimsuit.

For the best historical spa experience, you must try the Buckstaff Bathhouse. They do things the way they were done 100 years ago. It’s a unique experience that isn’t to be missed. Get the full bathing package, but get there when they open. They’re very popular and don’t take appointments. Once you’re in, allow about an hour and a half for services. I recommend bringing your own non-skid flip flops to any bathhouse.

Feel free to ask me any other questions you have! I hope you enjoy your trip!",t2_95m1z,WhichHazel,0,1632309915.0,0,t1_hdty6s6,hdty6s6,True,lilsouthern228,t3_pt2nlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotSprings/comments/pt2nlr/visiting_in_december/,Visiting in December,/r/HotSprings/comments/pt2nlr/visiting_in_december/hdty6s6/,9,r/HotSprings,0,9

1.) If you’re here in early December, look on the Prospect/Quapaw Facebook page to see if you’re here at the same time that they do the drive-through luminary show. They usually do it the first weekend in December. It’s AMAZING. 

2.) Gingerbread house and hot cocoa in the Arlington hotel lobby. 

3.) Holiday lights at Garvan Woodland Gardens. 

4.) Walking downtown after dark to see the lights. Pro-tip: bring an insulated mug and some of your favorite cocoa/tea bag, etc. Make yourself a drink using the free hot water by the park admin building to keep you warm while you enjoy the scenery.",t2_95m1z,WhichHazel,0,1632309782.0,0,t1_hdtxzph,hdtxzph,True,lilsouthern228,t3_pt2nlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotSprings/comments/pt2nlr/visiting_in_december/,Visiting in December,/r/HotSprings/comments/pt2nlr/visiting_in_december/hdtxzph/,4,r/HotSprings,0,4

"Look at what is growing in the area?  Hot Springs as a safe, clean retirement community.  The fact that a huge amount of the area is managed by the feds as national parks, national forests and wildlife refuges means the area is under good management and isn't going to turn into a sprawling suburban dystopian landscape like Texas.

"Great insights. Agree completely. Beyond a vacation and gambling destination, I truly think the city’s organic growth life line over the next 20-30 years is capitalizing on its unique capacity to grow an outdoor industry. This industry attracts the age group that it’s missing. The age group that it’s missing is more mobile than ever in their careers, which reduces the historical geographic isolation.

"I'm really against it.  I think an outdoor amphitheater will just turn into a city-sanctioned church, with religious organizations fighting over who gets to use it.

A better use would be as some kind of public open market.  A space where people could rent stalls either for a day, or some built-up places that could be rented longer term (the way New Orleans French Market operates).     


One business that's booming in the area are flea markets and thrift stores.  Create a large public space where people can bring stuff to sell: antiques, crafts, etc.  I know there are lots of these locations already but a nice quality public space would attract a LOT of traffic.  All the time too... because while maybe on the weekends it would always be packed, there'd still be people there on the weekdays to buy/sell stuff.    


Best of all, it wouldn't cost hardly anything to set this up and maintain it.

"I think this is a great question and there is no simple answer.  It's a combination of what everybody else here has said.   I do disagree that ""crime"" is any significant deterrent.  Having lived all around the world, Hot Springs has significantly less criminal activity than most places.  


I do think there are some basic factors that are responsible for HS being where it is:  


1.  Hot Springs' grew as a city 150+ years ago because it was a special destination due to the springs and the mythology around them.  With the increases in science, the notion that the waters can ""cure"" people is more of an amusing anecdote than a serious consideration among most people - so that whole draw is much softer than it used to be.
2. Other things that caused Hot Springs to boom, like gambling and other activity during times like Prohibition, as well as the classic days of ""road trips"" and ""Route 66"" as a vacation destination, either faded out or became overshadowed by more appealing destinations.  The ""motor lodge"" era where cities popped up along the artery highways are a thing of the past, even though ironically, Hot Springs is one of the few cities that has a large amount of those remnants still in existence -- and it's one of the charming aspects of the city - it's basically been ""left alone"" since its hey-day and is like a bit of a time capsule.
3. Other sources of jobs have either dried up, been out-sourced or faded away.  There are some employment opportunities in the area, but for younger people, HS is simply not their best choice for careers and employment... this explains the regions very high average resident age -- it's more of a retirement community.  There are less young people here because there's less opportunities.
4. Hot Springs' actual location is quite isolated.   This is one of the few old major cities that is not serviced by an interstate highway.  I-30 is far away.  I-49 doesn't go up this far.   In this manner, Hot Springs has basically been ""cut off"" from the advancement of civilization  in other areas.  While this has ""frozen"" the city in time, it's also resulted in a much smaller, more intimate, quainter city, that doesn't have outrageous real estate prices.   If I-49 comes up near Hot Springs, that could be a major boon.  If 270 turned into I-35, that would be a big boost as well.

I like to look at Hot Springs as something special.  The fact that it's not as big/fancy a city as other places now makes it more unique.  We should embrace and celebrate our uniqueness.  


However, it sure would be great to attract more business and activity.  I dislike that the main efforts in this area seem to be centered around gambling and casino expansion.  This doesn't benefit the whole region as much as it enriches a smaller upper class.  


I have my ideas on developments that could bring more people and jobs.

"Our best restaurants? 

Budget and Must-Eat: McClard’s BBQ. Legendary and favorite of President Bill Clinton. Going for unusual? If you can handle spicy, get a tamale spread! 

Splurge: 501 Prime. Taste of Home calls it the best steakhouse in the state. It’s expensive, but worth it. Looking for a cheaper option? Go for the Wednesday buck a shuck oysters or book at table at their Bourbon Bar (same cooks, cheaper menu.) Luna Bella is also great. 

Best Bar/ Drinks: The Rooftop Bar at the Avenue Hotel has the best views of the city. Go after dark and get the old fashioned. The Ohio Club is the oldest bar in the state, and fabulous. They have great live music all the time. The Superior Brewery is the place for beer lovers—-it’s the only brewery in the US that uses thermal water. 

Music: Arlington lobby on Saturday nights, or Maxine’s. Also check the city website to see what events might be going on when you’re here. Oaklawn Casino hosts concerts now, too. 

Best pizza: SQUZBX. People will tell you that Deluca’s is the best. Don’t trust them. 

Best for families: Mid America Science Museum, Garvan Woodland Gardens, Magic Springs and Crystal Falls Amusement Park, Fordyce Bathhouse Museum, Mountain Tower, our many lakes and camping areas. 

Best of the National Park: Gulpha Gorge, Promenade, Bathhouse Row. Be sure to check out the free museum in the Fordyce! West Mountain overlook after dark. See if any guided ranger hikes are available when you’re here, as well. 

Best Brunches/Breakfasts: Arlington Sunday Brunch is a splurge, but amazing. Best Court Cafe is incredible. Pancake Shop (fresh food, local meats) is the best overall (both in quality and price), but get there very early or you won’t get a table. You may have a wait a bit—-but I promise it is worth it. 

Best Food Trucks: Try the 420 Food Truck Court for a huge selection of amazing food trucks. Outdoor dining. 

Best Mexican: Quetzal. Bonus points for their adventurous, authentic menu. Order something unusual here—-you won’t regret it. Capo’s Tacos is not super authentic, but they have good tacos and excellent margaritas. 

Don’t Waste Time/Money On: 

The Duck Boats. Big tourist trap, very expensive, very hot, very crowded. The tour guides usually have incorrect information, and the Duck boats are a safety hazard. People have literally died on them. 

The Ghost Tour: The dude is a hack and will tell you lies. If you want ghost stories about Hot Springs, message me and I’ll give you better ones for free. 

Best Italian: Mama’s Little Italy or Angel’s.

Best Downtown Shops: The Bathhouse Soapery is a can’t miss for people who love to pamper themselves. They have homeade bath products that are phenomenal. The gift shop at the Ozark Bathhouse has lots of great local books. Mamoo’s Paradise Ice Cream is homeade and so good. 

For Art and Craft Lovers: check out the many art galleries downtown, or book a day at one of our many painting studios. 

Best Coffee Shop: Red Light Roastery, hands down. They have weird hours, but they’re a can’t miss. They roast their own beans and have delicious homeade treats. A close second place is Kollective Coffee. Still great, but not as great as Red Light 

Best Places to Enjoy the Water: 

Bring your own glass bottles to the pump by the Lamar Bathhouse. Scorching hot spring water—-delicious and free. 

For the grownups, you can soak all day at the Ozark Bathhouse’s communal pools for only $24. Spots fill up fast though, so get there right when they open. Bring cash for snacks and drinks. BYO swimsuit.

For the best historical spa experience, you must try the Buckstaff Bathhouse. They do things the way they were done 100 years ago. It’s a unique experience that isn’t to be missed. Get the full bathing package, but get there when they open. They’re very popular and don’t take appointments. Once you’re in, allow about an hour and a half for services. I recommend bringing your own non-skid flip flops to any bathhouse. 

If you don’t mind crowds, go play the ponies at Oaklawn! It’s free to get in, and kids love to watch the horses. Don’t leave without trying a corned beef sandwich.

"I was flying a lot in the last few years before covid.   I sat next to and talked to a lot of higher level supervisors and manager types.

The deal is that employers and industry are looking to locate where people are 1) trainable;  and 2) have infrastructure that includes training and education.   3) have the infrastructure set up to actually employ them

Almost all of them were flying around to check on plants (clean industry) and the employees in those places make very good pay.......but they have traiing in robotics, software, etc.

Interestingly I was flying in to towns and cities where they were also going  ..... all places that have very good economies, lots of really nice apartment complexes, etc. (which you need for a younger workforce. )

Noe of which HS has.   So it's like 5-fold or more problem........not any one thing.

(and it did bother me when the guy kept saying ""trainable""......I guess there are places with better STEM education and tech schools and such and those are where the hiring managers are getting workers.........straight out of high schools and trainiing on the job?)  The way he talked AR and particularly HS was not exactly a gold-mine for such mining  of talent.   I know the education thing is somewhat of a red state problem ---- keep coming in like 5th from last, etc.

"It seems a big response we keep getting here is income earning potential for 20 - 40 year olds. And because there's a big gap in that age group and  earning abilities in HS, there's a cap on the level of enterprises that are willing to take the risk of starting businesses that benefit from that demographic. Some has been developed because of tourism, but it's been limited. I wonder what the city is doing to try and draw in these higher-earning tech youngsters who CAN work from anywhere. A relatively high percentage those dudes wind up starting their own gigs, which would trickle more into the local economy with job growth in that sector. 

  
It's amazing how many people leave arkansas to eventually be called back to it. I'm one of them. There are a lot of draws to it that only people who grew up here understand...to outsiders we're a bunch of rednecks, but non-natives who DO move here AND have money end up loving it.  Maybe the low-hanging fruit should be for the city to go after younger native arkansans, 30s to 40s, who have started businesses (or are at a high level) out of state, and try to lure those guys and their businesses (and their non-native higher-earning employees) back here.",t2_9ijcos1n,SUParky,0,1629419404.0,0,t1_h9lpahq,h9lpahq,False,SUParky,t3_p767es,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotSprings/comments/p767es/what_has_held_hs_back/,What has held HS back?,/r/HotSprings/comments/p767es/what_has_held_hs_back/h9lpahq/,3,r/HotSprings,0,3

Buying a home here seems affordable, even if rents are rising right along with insurance, taxes, lumber, labor, and home goods.  Our police department is professional and hard-working, with officers representing the diversity of our community.  I own a few rentals and need only ask for officers to drive-by more frequently when one of them in between renters, as unoccupied buildings are a draw for illegal activities.

"I hear you. And I agree. One of the frustrating things Im seeing is how many properties (I’ve been looking mostly at the core downtown areas inside grand and out towards the airport) owned by out of state people. And yes, if you drive down any random street, of 4-5 homes on the block, maybe one will look like it’s been maintained well. The city does need more engaged property owners, especially for homes valued in the $40-100k range and I’d be looking to fit that bill. 

Additionally, a lot of the homes that have been fixed up by investors have been turned into short term rentals, which muscles out more properties that could have been good homes for local long term renters or local home buyers. 

And the thing that attracts me to it IS the fact that it’s a very low cost place of living in such an amazing setting, and I see a ton of potential there. I think it’s just a matter of time before more outside money finds it as a place of “I want to live here” growth rather than just a resort destination town, I’d rather get some investment there now rather than later. 

Thanks for your input. I am actually trying to talk my wife into moving there.

"If you think HS is  so \*economically depressed\*, why are you looking to buy up lots of rentals in a place like that?

???

Why not come and live in the area for a few years and then may YOU can tell US what is wrong and how people investing in our great town can improve things.

RIght now this comes off as an out-of-towner who is picking the brains of the locals.  I can tell you this:   the last thing HS needs right now is any kind of gentrification, as most of the jobs here are low-wage service jobs in tourism, restaurants, and retail.   They can't afford higher rents......and there are already enough out-of-town landlords working thru management companies (or not) who are not very responsible to their tenants.  I'm a homeowner but I know these things because I ask and see.

Air service, when we have a little airport right there, would be a great start.  Hard to have ""commerce"" when you don't have a major interstate nearby or a local air field, etc.

Young and vibrant industry requires a trained workforce as well.   Not unskilled labor that doesn't pay and has no benefits.  That is another area that needs improvement here.

I'd suggest getting involved with economic development orgs here.

Also, I have learned that best way to learn about a community is thru.........**volunteerism**.  You learn a lot about the needs of a community that way.  


Your plus right now is that you seem to have an innate appreciation for HS.....put that to work and see where and how you can improve things.   Once you do that, YOUR investments will naturally do better........it's all connected\~",t2_2a9ewp0m,10MileHike,0,1629363843.0,0,t1_h9ig0l4,h9ig0l4,True,SUParky,t3_p767es,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotSprings/comments/p767es/what_has_held_hs_back/,What has held HS back?,/r/HotSprings/comments/p767es/what_has_held_hs_back/h9ig0l4/,6,r/HotSprings,0,6

"Hey this may be too late to post but what the hell (I don’t get on Reddit as often as I’d like). So yeah bar scene is where you can find nightlife activity from locals and tourists. I’m in my mid twenties and have been in Hot Springs majority of my life and it’s not very very seamless to find niche things. Ya gotta dig for it. Covid made this even more difficult than what it already was. Before covid I was aprt of a few niche things like yoga in the park on Monday nights in downtown. Starlite club held Flow arts Tuesdays where people would engage in flo arts of any kind. The two bartenders of the night would host this because of their Flow arts background. Also, Starlite would host Turntable Tuesdays where a local DJ would bring his vinyl and digital set up and would demo the art of DJing, you were encouraged to bring a flash drive or own records so you could practice yourself with his equipment. I also attended Fiber Art Fridays, where we would meet up and stitch, sew, crochet, leather work, anything really and just have snacks and hang out. These are just some examples of things that exsisted before covid and have not been reinstated since. Bar life is what’s kinda hoppin cause there’s not a lot of other groups or functions that have reconvened since. I would check out garland county library tho, I’ve attended some workshops there (free mostly). And yeah Facebook is still a hub that’s used by locals for meets ups, just start following some group pages and the algorithms will slowly trickle more recomendations. Join as much groups as you can just to get an idea what groups are doing meet-ups and such. I cycle and hike so I follow some local foraging and bike pages. Every first Friday of the month, there’s Gallery walk, great place to meet all kinds of locals, I’m introvert so it helps that there are free booze and aweomse people to make some connections. There’s also an LGBTQ group somewhere and I know they recently hosted a pic nic last month. There’s some real interesting folks out here (new,old, young, whatever) but they’re are kinda just laying low. Don’t give up. And hey you might want to start something up yourself.

"Three Hot Springs police officers are on administrative leave after a local man who was taken into custody due to his behavior during a welfare check Saturday morning reportedly became unresponsive and later died, the police department said in a news release.

At approximately 9:45 a.m., officers responded to the 3300 block of Central Avenue in reference to a welfare check and made contact with Brandon Klorik, 30, of Hot Springs, and ""due to his behavior, he was placed into custody,"" the release said.

While in custody, Klorik reportedly became unresponsive and emergency medical personnel were called to the scene to provide treatment. He was transported to a local hospital for additional treatment, but attempts to resuscitate Klorik were unsuccessful and he was declared deceased, it said.

""The Arkansas State Police were requested to investigate the incident and they assumed the investigation,"" Sgt. Patrick Langley said in the release.

It's sarcasm by the way. I don't want anyone to die from Covid. 

It's why I wear a mask where ever I go as does my family and have since last year. It's why I got vaccinated as soon as I could as did my family and it's why I self-quarantine as much as I can.
