"Cannelle/The Great Commoner is where you can go if you need an instagram-worthy pastry or lunch. I've been there three times and tried a random variety of pastries each time. Also tried their lox toast, had an cappuccino, and coffee. I believe giving places a few tries in order to make sure I know how they are to account for variation in the menu, freshness, and business.

I've been really disappointed every time I went here.

Each time I entered starry-eyed and positively overwhelmed by the amazing looking pastries and the wide variation they have, despite the growing concern over the quality-to-presentation ratio each time I went in.

I like to judge bakeries primarily based on their plain croissants, then, I will take into account everything else secondary to that. The plain croissant is quintessential of a bakery as it demonstrates their ability to bake without covering it up with any fruits, chocolate, nuts, etc. Just the essential pastry ingredients and their ability to bake it. It lets me know what they cover up in all their other goods. In the case of Cannelle/The Great Commoner, this test wasn't necessary as all their baked goods were immediately underwhelming in the quality of freshness. And yes, I went early in the mornings other than one visit during lunch, to get the freshest batch. 

The croissant was fine, albeit, a quite stale and lacked fluff. Neither of these things are deal-breakers nor are they required, however, I can get a better croissant from any grocery store's bakery section in a pre-packaged container of 12. I'd rather just not have one if I had to choose between the two. Additionally, Cannelle/The Great Commoner's croissant did have a decent amount of flakiness, and 'butteryness', but the main issue for me was the staleness. It's just, for a place that presents itself the way it does, I expected greatness, what I got was mediocrity and yes, I can make them better myself from home in large batches.

As for all of their other pastries, I tried about nine different random ones and they all had the same issue as the croissant. There's just a distinct staleness and lack of moisture in all of the ones I've tried. Some were just impractical to eat like the one with the large moon shaped chocolate crest on top - specifically, the chocolate consistency - it was rock-hard and just cracked all over the place and was an inconvenient, messy contrast to the rest of the cake it was on. It's fine to have a fancy ornament to show a little artistic touch, but make sure it's good to eat. It's basically the same situation of fondant - looks really nice but tastes the way it does.

The lox toast I got was fine. A little pricey compared to other places lox offerings, but not really a huge deal or the focus of my issue with this place. It was passable and I'd get it again if I ever go there again, but that's not likely.

The coffee is fine, but the cappuccino was burnt and beyond bitter. On top of that, I ordered for dine-in and was served the cappuccino in a normal-sized takeout paper cup, while others were getting cappuccino cups. I saw people after me get cappuccino cups and everything else I ordered was served dine-in style so it was probably an accidental mix-up and may have contributed to the poor flavor, so just wanted to note that. The workers were kind and prompt though, nothing exceptional or noteworthy. I ordered my stuff and got it fairly quickly and that was about it. No mishaps or misunderstandings other than the accident with the cappuccino cup (just seemed like a strange thing to put in a normal sized cup because it was exactly what you imagine - a normal sized coffee cup that's 1/10th full of liquid).


**TL;DR** - Cannelle/The Greate Commoner is haughty and instagram-worthy, but lacks freshness. The quality is focused more on presentation than flavor (flavor freshness, to be specific, not flavor diversity - they had plenty of flavors, they were just all stale). It's not for me, but there's definitely a market for this type of art.

**Other desserts that are good in no particular order:**

* If you want a good, fresh bakery that's also amazing looking, try Yoon's on Plymouth.

* If you want good macaroons, go to Tea Haus - almost always fresh and randomly massive.

* If you want good ice cream - it's all good, we all scream for ice cream. Go wherever: Blank slate, Michigan Creamery, any Indian restaurant that serves kulfi, any grocery store that has Jeni's.

* Most Indian restaurants have really good desserts all together.

* I also second just about every other mention in this thread other than Cannelle/The Great Commoner.",t2_smc9q,AsajjVentressBFF,0,1649008021.0,0,t1_i38y2it,i38y2it,False,MrAnnArbor,t3_tv8z9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tv8z9e/now_that_luca_pastry_is_open_on_washtenaw_lets/,"Now that Luca Pastry is open on Washtenaw, let’s make a list of the dessert places in A^2.

"Some good answers have been given here. Fruits of Recovery and the Friday night meeting both at the Northside church are LGBT oriented, and the majority of people who attend are LGBT. 

As for non-LGBT (but still helpful on other days of the week):

The Alano club is good for meetings there's usually one going all day, but the older crowd might not be your thing (it's not mine usually). 

SNOW at 242 church on Saturday nights is good, but it's not a traditional group meeting; a person shares their story for the meeting and that's it. Although a ton of people hang around before and after which is a good place to talk.

HVAI.org is an awesome place to find different meetings and I believe they have an indicator next to certain meetings if they identify as LGBT focused. 

Pretty much any meeting you go to is good for beginners. AA groups mainly exist to help the newcomer, so if you mention that you're just starting out, you will get a ton of people who will provide you with numbers, resources, and general experiences to help you out.

"Ann Arbor can barely gentrify compared to most places where it's an actual problem. It's never really been that low, so you can't get the sort of drastic turnover of flipping over a neighborhood and driving out everyone. Most university towns are also actually relatively stable, so I'm not sure the university town writ large is the best place to focus on with that issue. The last place I lived had this problem - I heard gunshots consistently, as well as street racing a block away, and could also walk to the best restaurants in my town. The violence increased and the tension was palpable as new developments went in where places were condemned, brownfield sites or former squat houses. Totally different vibe here. 

The town is getting pricier but the degree of transformation just doesn't compare to most places that have say, a historical immigrant neighborhood that all the tech folks move into and start displacing them with rising property taxes. Some towns have universities and have the problem, sure, and I'm sure it's happened here - but again it's a matter of degree.

"Nah, not everything is about prejudice. BMX'ers go faster, higher, and are on a way more dangerous object. Scooters tend to have a different sense of the etiquette, so much as there is one. BMX'ers and scooters also fall/bail way less often and so they take long ass runs that end up snaking skaters who are usually trying relatively short runs, or are even trying single tricks - so there's that issue as well.

Personally, I'm cool with whoever as long as they take the time to learn the etiquette of a spot with regards to safety and sharing (like, if you keep taking super long runs not cool), but when there are different things being ridden you get into the issue of each crew bringing in their own ways of doing things, and if it's primarily a skate park that just isn't cool. And for real, whatever makes you happy, go for it - but if it's bringing out unnecessary risk, or you're hogging space and there's a formal rule against it - like a dog off leash in a public park, then there might be some issues.

"Dawn Farm Community of Programs for sure. They have outpatient and longer term residential treatment.  
If they can get over the refusal to stay inpatient, the starting point for Dawn Farm is Spera Detox. 
I stayed there for three weeks in 2016, went to transitional housing for 6 months, and have been sober ever since. 
Definitely didn’t want to go anywhere I needed to stay 24/7 either because how was I going to get drunk in between meetings that way?! But your relative is their own person and might have success with outpatient. I do have friends who have stayed sober that way. 
Let’s remember, alcoholism is a progressive (and fatal) disease. If outpatient doesn’t stick, they’ll progress on to a stay in detox and if that doesn’t stick, they’ll progress on to a 3 month residential, etc.

I think they are a good idea if you trust your realtor. They are prone to misuse but from my very limited personal experience, they can be very useful.

Edit: the other tool I really think works well is the ""buyer will cover up to $x in repairs identified by buyer's inspector."" Inspection-related negotiations are a pain in the ass for everyone and offering to basically forgo minor squabbles over minor repairs can be very attractive to someone looking to simplify the entire selling process.

"Moved here from Boulder and its relatively inexpensive for housing. You can pretty much say that Ann Arbor is cheaper than most of Colorado these days. Ann Arbor is where Boulder was in the 90s for buying a house, but it does seem seem rent is ridiculous.

 I can see though Ann Arbor being expensive for people coming from less expensive parts to f the country. Ann Arbor is mid range expensive for housing, but you can find good deals if you keep looking and are willing to broaden your search.

The property taxes are high but there is a lot that you get for them. Great schools, no charge for trash, recycling and compost which is a huge expense, really nice parks and green spaces and a good bike transit and bus system.

Im new here but my much of my wife's family lives here or in surrounding areas. If you have kids this place is awesome.

Food prices, relative to Boulder are less expensive for comparitive standards. Way better restaurants and a greater variety too. Boulder is in no way the foodie capital that its been crowned for some reason. Ann Arbor has a great selection and variety of supermarkets, co ops and the farmers market.

Like I stated, Ann Arbor is really great if you are in the parenting stage of life, but like Boulder if you just are out of college it can be pretty tough. I stayed in Boulder through my 20s and 30s and if it wasn't for the Rocky Mountains I wouldn't have stayed like everyone else I knew. University towns are transient which may be why some people dont feel like Ann Arbor is very hospitable but for others in a different stage of life its perfect.

As for gentrification my wife says its has changed but not nearly as much as Boulder has. There is still a lot of diversity in Ann Arbor comparatively. Unfortunately gentrification is a problem all over the country especially in University towns and cities where people want to live and tech is booming.
As much as I want places to succeed and have jobs, tech bings in rich and rather uninteresting people. Namely google, apple, facebook, amazon etc. The tech boom killed everything interesting about Boulder. Its just another sterile silicon valley now. Rich coastal elites have killed everything interesting as well

Ann Arbor is still far more interesting culturally and it has a lot of great festivals and cultural celebrations. All that disappeared in Boulder.

Another great thing about Ann Arbor is the amount and diversity of health care. From western medicine to more traditional types of ""alternative"" medicine Ann Arbor is fantastic.

"As other comments have suggested, it really depends on how you consider cost of living. Coming from LA, it’s cheap. But coming from the Midwest or more rural places, it’s expensive. I think something not enough people mention is cost of living outside of actual housing. Like my apartment comes with heat and water, which is a huge saving ($1200 for 2br) and like grocery costs/food costs are low especially if you utilize the great mom & pop restaurants in the surrounding areas instead of eating downtown where the restaurants are ‘nicer’ and more expensive. They have their place but it makes it seem unaffordable. Overall if you have a decent stipend as a student or can swing a job/some loans it’s a great place to live and you’ll likely be fine. 

For reference, I live off $36000/year stipend and live in a 2br alone and have money to spend as well. It’s all about management.

"I've seen police brutalize multiple homeless people while working on Main St, and its a bit of a local secret that the police do street sweeps prior to the Art Show trying to incarcerate the homeless so tourists won't have to see them. Also seen cops throw around drunk sorority girls who are being disorderly WAY beyond anything necessary or appropriate - I'm talking like grown men throwing 19 year old girls onto pavement and kneeling on their necks bc they ""resisted."" 

Then you have campus police, who've historically and recently come under a lot of fire for racist enforcement like singling out black students as potential trespassers in dorms, or handing less severe punishments to white students vs students of color. Not to mention the often failed follow-ups to racist incidents in the dorms like writing slurs on doors, vandalizing decor/signage related to people of color, etc. 

If you're part of the ""core"" of Ann Arbor, which is the rich white populace in the city and close neighborhoods, the police leave you alone. If you're vulnerable, that's an entirely different story. It's like living in two different worlds. 

Also look up Aura Rosser and the subsequent failure to properly address the situation by the mayor.

You can find a spot, sure, but you have to sift through a lot of iffy properties to find it - the market is designed to take advantage of rich kids with no life experience. 

Ann Arbor is also incredibly white and over policed.

There's also a lot of hostility towards the homeless - the city itself does some pretty shady things while the citizens smile and act polite (worth looking into how the city preps for Art Fair, etc in terms of ""cleaning up the streets"") 

That being said, it also has access to nature and plenty of shops (except for affordable groceries - all the rich folks made sure that superstores and ""low quality"" food options were pushed out to Saline and Ypsi).

"Depends on what you're looming for. I'll list out the major pros amd cons in my opinion. For recerence I'm comparing it to Philly where I lived in my early 20s and New England where I grew up:

The good: safe+clean, very walkable, good diversity of activities (Gaming, outdoors, artsy theaters, proximity to Detroit, UofM sports), liberal political climate (not the case for many other places in Michigan), great craft beer scene, food is above average (good American/pub food but falls short of big cities for international stuff. Not that there isn't good international food, just not as much), job prospects are great (tech+UofM), winters are getting more mild.

The not great: Very expensive. It's almost impossible to buy a house unless you have a rich benefactor that can lend you hundreds of thousands in cash. The fact that rich students (median household income over 100k) will pay any price to rent downtown drives up prices. Downtown itself is kind of meh. It's not bad but it's mostly bars and restaurants so it can be boring if you're looking fir something else to do. The city is thankfully ggetting more bike/pedestrian friendly but there's still a lot of work to do in that regard especially in terms if accessibility.

"Your comment about the people has been pretty different from our experience, but it probably depends what part of town you’re in and what you’re doing. We’ve got a great neighborhood where it’s very common to strike up a random conversation with other folks, especially if your dog makes initial contact by going up to give a sniff or vice versa, or if you both have kids.

On the other hand, if one or the other is walking with headphones in… yeah, that’s become the international symbol for I don’t want to talk.

"Relatively expensive, but not if you're coming from the coasts.  Nice, clean city, stuff to keep busy but again, relative, if you're coming from a bigger city.  The nature and emphasis on walk-ability, bike-ability is nice. Pretty good selection of restaurants for a city this size. 

The real cons for me are the weather (6 months of winter as evidenced by our snow yesterday) and honestly, the people.  For whatever reason, people tend to keep to themselves, don't really say hi or make conversation, no smile and wave.  Again, maybe it's relative (if you're from NYC you're probably used to it) but the [unfriendliness](https://www.freep.com/story/life/2016/07/07/america-rudest-cities-detroit-ann-arbor/86798830/) of people here is palpable.

On the flip side, I like that I can do most things online - state farm wanted me to call them, and I know some people like the personal touch - I just want to go online, add a car, hit print, and let me go on with my day.  

Some have the “safe driver” discounts that plug in to your diagnostic port or bluetooth.   They are terrible.   The state farm one never worked, the progressive on almost caused accidents or worse when it beeped when I would try to stop - nice to make you conscious of abrupt stops, but a deer/person/car jumping in front of you to be rewarded with a loud beep is just plain dangerous.

Make sure you get rental car insurance.   Let me tell you, 3 months of no car, but making car payments - not fun.

Shop around every year.  State farm was great but would up my price every year.  I had to switch to progressive and then, only then, would state farm beat their price.  Same as cable providers, cell phones, etc - you have to constantly shop around, they make their money on loyal customers that don’t, unfortunately, rather than repaying loyalty.",t2_5rpl19yy,a2jeeper,0,1648824869.0,0,t1_i2znl49,i2znl49,True,REPSAC_,t3_tt425y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tt425y/auto_insurance_recommendation/,Auto insurance recommendation,/r/AnnArbor/comments/tt425y/auto_insurance_recommendation/i2znl49/,2,r/AnnArbor,0,2
"Ann Arbor needs more apartment buildings and townhouses since they're most affordable and best for the environment, but many voters here are viscerally opposed to that kind of housing.

Unfortunately this area is zoned for single-family homes. Building something in this spot inside US-23 would be better than building nothing, so more single-family houses is currently the only choice to alleviate the housing crisis here.

> Homes would sit on 70-foot-wide lots, in accordance with the site’s single-family zoning, with one-story ranches between 2,300 and 2,600 square feet and two-story homes between 2,600 and 3,500 square feet, according to Toll Brothers.

"With the disclaimer that bar pool is fun even on bad tables:

The tables at Sticks are in pretty bad shape unless they've done something in the last year. Bad felt, bad rails, not level, some weird spots on the felt that are probably spills. I think they're 8-footers. though, and they're pay-by-the-hour and not pay-by-the-game so that's a big plus.

8 ball is charming, the tables are in better shape than expected, and are 7-foot bar boxes. When I was in there I think it was free to play but it was like a random weeknight with like 2 people in the bar total.

Babs has a good full-sized table, a little worn but in mostly good shape. I think it might be the regulation 9' but it's been a while since I was there. Very college-y. Pretty sure I was the oldest person in there, lol.

Bobcat Bonnie's  is a 7' table that takes quarters (not sure if they ever ""open it up"" for hourly play, but it seemed like it was in good shape.

"It sounds like you enjoy music, so I would highly recommend the Blue LLama jazz club. It’s on Main Street across from the M den very close to where you’re staying. They have live music every night Tuesday-Saturday and an amazing dinner menu. Definitely make a reservation, though especially if you’re looking at a busy night. $10 cover unless it’s a larger act then they sell tickets that include dinner and a show. Also right next door to the blue llama is the Arc. No food there, but it’s a great space for listening to music. I believe you have to buy tickets ahead of time there. Both spaces have some of the best acoustics in the country.

I really like [this article](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2020/8/10/i-did-the-math-on-my-towns-cul-de-sacs) because it analyses exactly that. Scio township has plenty of culs-de-sac that are [in pretty desperate need for repair](https://maps.app.goo.gl/mBmptovcRR47xSsN6). The big box ""money makers"" [don't exactly make that much money anyway](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2018/5/9/big-box-supercenters-prize-or-curse). For example, [the Meijer on Jackson road](https://bsaonline.com/SiteSearch/SiteSearchDetails?SearchFocus=All+Records&SearchCategory=Address&SearchText=5645+Jackson&uid=127&PageIndex=1&ReferenceKey=H+-08-21-400-043&ReferenceType=0&SortBy=&SearchOrigin=0&RecordKeyDisplayString=H+-08-21-400-043&RecordKey=H+-08-21-400-043&RecordKeyType=0) is bringing in about a quarter million in overall property taxes annually on just shy of 33 acres. That's about $7500/acre. Selecting [one of the physically nearest houses](https://bsaonline.com/SiteSearch/SiteSearchDetails?SearchFocus=All+Records&SearchCategory=Address&SearchText=259+sandrock&uid=127&PageIndex=1&ReferenceKey=H+-08-28-130-021&ReferenceType=0&SortBy=&SearchOrigin=0&RecordKeyDisplayString=H+-08-28-130-021&RecordKey=H+-08-28-130-021&RecordKeyType=0), they're paying about $7200/year for 0.36 acres, or $20,000/acre. So in terms of land area, these suburbs are actually paying more per acre in property taxes. Of course, this varies dramatically by the house too, with smaller lots typically paying a higher per-acre amount (and likely having less streetfront too).

"Regarding board games:

Vault of Midnight is an AWESOME comic and game store with an excellent vibe and helpful employees. I stopped buying games online and  just have them order whatever I might be looking for. I'd rather pay a little extra to keep them in business. That said, they don't have game space. 

If you're on BoardGameGeek (or can join), check out the guild ""Great Oaks Board Game Days.""  It's located at a co-housing development on the outskirts of town and once a month they use the big common room for a game meetup. Lots of nice chill people have attended in my experience. 

Ann Arbor doesn't have a board game cafe unfortunately. There are some places that were testing out game nights (York comes to mind) but COVID put a damper on that. Maybe as things start opening up more again it'll happen. 

Places to walk - so many! 

The border-to-border trail along the Huron River, the city's system of Natural Areas (eg Bird Hills and Barton) is awesome, Gallup Park, the Arb. Driving outside of Ann Arbor, the County has a large system of Nature Preserves with Nature Trails.  Otherwise, walking a loop around downtown (Kerrytown to Main Street area, up to State Street and back) has plenty of people if you're looking to walk in a more populated environment. 

EDIT: Kayaking

You can rent kayaks from the Argo Canoe Livery (city owned) and paddle around the pond there OR continue through the argo cascades (a man-made rapids course - pretty tame) and then go all the way down the river to Gallup park. About 90 minute trip and there's a van service the city operates to take you back to Argo. 

If you want a more natural experience, Skips Canoe Livery about 20 minutes outside of town is on the Huron River and offers a variety of trip lengths. Good service too.

"Ann Arbor built the underground parking structure with a plan to build a mixed use residential/commercial building on top of it.   It was a nice plan, had a variety of housing and commercial options as well as a small plaza in front. The city council in all of their wisdom didn't really do enough to make sure it would get built.  This yutz swoops in and convinces enough people to put a measure on the ballot that would force it to be a park instead.  Somehow people voted for it - there was a big student turnout that year and many of them understandably didn't know what they were voting for but it sounded good. It's not a good location for a park - it's too small and hard to develop into anything useful.  It's not close enough to enough residential areas to be used.  The always controversial liberty plaza is right next door and has it's own issues.  The library didn't want it there because they feared it would just invite problems.  There was no actual funding to pay for any sort of park and no likelihood of that materializing given how dysfunctional that city council is.  So now it sits as a parking lot, probably forever.  There have been some ridiculous recent proposals for the park that weren't even drawn to scale and of course there's no funding for it.  And we can thank this guy for it.  I'm sure there's much more that I'm forgetting.

"Public sector salary for that role (capped): 73,000

Private sector *starting salary* for a similar role as a controller: 145,000

You have absolutely no idea what you’re talking about if you think someone will wake up and cut their salary in half, just to take up a job with a terrible salary, horrifying benefits and working conditions, and dealing with the stupid people of local government.

Read literally any reply here talking about how Scio township is full on incompetent people and corruption. 

Sorry if your feelings are hurt but this is reality, government does not keep up with the private sector.

"Unfortunately, $1500 for in-unit laundry and parking is pretty typical for Ann Arbor, so it might be tough to find something for less than that unless you're willing to look in surrounding towns. That being said, these are the ones I know of that might be slightly cheaper:

1. Woodbury Gardens- In-unit laundry and parking, starting around $1300
2. The Highlands- No in-unit laundry, but close to North Campus and starting somewhere around $1100
3. Green Briar Apartments- Studios start around $1100, including heat and water (which is a nice perk), but also no in-unit laundry I don't think
4. Manchester Flats- Starting around $1100, but no in-unit laundry
5. Ann Arbor Woods- I believe start around $1100, no in-unit laundry

If you're willing to go slightly further out, these might be more in your price range:

1. Lakestone Apartments- Still no in-unit laundry, but significantly cheaper with starting prices around $900, more on the west side of Ann Arbor
2. Willow Ridge Apartments- In-unit laundry, starting around $1200, close to WCC
3.

"I've found people sunbath all over the place without being catcalled/harrassed in my experience (I'm not female, but know plenty who sunbath around town and don't have any issues).  Popular sunbather spots in the summer:

* Elbel Field
* The Arb
* Palmer Field
* The Cascades along the shore
* On a raft/tube anywhere in the river
* The Docks near Bandemere
* Any city pool
* Any city park

If you really want more private, head down Huron River Drive and put yourself in the middle of any secluded field or somewhere along Barton Pond; or keep going an find a spot to chill in Delhi, Dexter-Huron, or Hudson Mills Metroparks.

If that doesn't work, call them & claim you just repaired your computer, please help me re-activate WIn10.   You likely will find it will just be activated right from the initial install.

"Well. You’ve found the right city. 

Kayaking - Barton/Argo ponds are nice. Also Gallup. You can do the cascades and a whole river trip. I don’t know if you have a kayak, but they rent them. 

Bubble Tea - hotly contested. You’ll have to try them for yourself. There’s Tea Ninja, Sharetea, Ding Tea, Chatime, Unitea, Quickly Boba, and Sweeting. It’s really become a thing lately.

Vault of Midnight is my game/comics store. They’re really nice over there.

Pictures can be taken all over campus/downtown and at all the nature spots.

Walking - Nichols Arboretum, Matthaei Botanical Gardens (go inside the conservatory, too), Gallup Park/BTB trail, County Farm Park. 

I don’t drink. Skeep/Scorekeepers has a repetition as an undergrad trap, though; I wouldn’t go there. 

But I love No Thai!, Blue Tractor, Detroit Filling Station/The Lunch Room, Black Pearl or Aventura for special events, Frita Batidos, Red Hawk, Big Ten Burrito/Baba Dari for fast food, TKWU, and Kanbu.",t2_2xtsreh5,Veauros,0,1648612867.0,0,t1_i2oagmn,i2oagmn,True,spashmcgrath94,t3_tr5fv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tr5fv0/moving_to_ann_arbor_in_may_need_some/,Moving to Ann Arbor in May!

Graffiti alley/towner alley same place its located on liberty (you can get to it via the other side but harder to notice) you can miss the Graffiti cool things to look at and also a homeless hangout not advised late at night alone.

Skeeps is scorekeepers. 

Circ over priced and well working in the industry I know more about that place and just best to avoid. 

Eight ball great place. 

Vault of midnight great place. 

Vegan food: First bite, lunch room, Detroit Street filling station, ann arbor coffee roasting company <tons of plant milk and vegan pastry items. 

Ant alley next to nickles arcade (real arcade not one with video games) has giant ants on the walls. 

Frank's restaurant: great local greasy spoon closes at 3pm (I think) best biscuits and gravy. 

Blimpy burger: great spot don't be intimidated by the ordering process they changed since I was a kid and they used to make u go to the end of the line to start over. 

Fleetwood diner: hippy hash is amazing 

Nypd: best pizza by the slice

The bus system will get you almost anywhere u want to go and are very reliable. 

Bubble tea: moon Cafe. Mr moon is amazing and make traditional Korean Boba. Quickly is pretty good. Chai time and there is one on state street I have heard good things about but I can't remember the name. 

Pictures: a2 has so many spots like Graffiti alley, the arboretum, state street, etc.

"I agree with what others said, you need to share the game/specs/use case and budget before you can get a reasonable answer.   Microcenter is by far the best local place.  But if a 10 year old computer is “on its last legs” but was otherwise ok for gaming any new-ish computer would be fine, or just fix it (swap to an ssd or upgrade mem?).   Or are we talking a new game that must have the best performance, etc.  Basically a new “gaming” computer is the worst investment you could ever make, worse than buying a boat.   Gaming is also a colossal waste of time.  But, like a boat, you spend the money because you like it.   It is an investment in being happy.  But don’t over buy, because whatever you get now will be immediately out of date and worth 50% (generally speaking, the market is weird now but won’t be long term).",t2_5rpl19yy,a2jeeper,0,1648577079.0,0,t1_i2le67c,i2le67c,True,TigerOrWeasel,t3_tr1pn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tr1pn5/recommendations_gaming_pc_build/,Recommendations: Gaming PC build,/r/AnnArbor/comments/tr1pn5/recommendations_gaming_pc_build/i2le67c/,1,r/AnnArbor,0,1

"I found an article about it in the Ann Arbor News from September 25, 2004. I can't link to it because it's in a protected database, but if you have an Ann Arbor District Library account you can access it online. The incident happened in 2003 to a third-grader who was developmentally impaired.

The teacher did not get fired (at least not immediately after the incident), she got a letter of reprimand and went on a paid leave of absence for the rest of the year. The parent ended up suing the district.

""The duct taping occurred on Jan. 29, 2003, in a music class taught by Penni Paul. Three students, including the plaintiff's son, caused a disruption in the class and Paul subsequently taped the plaintiff's son around the thighs to the seat of his chair, according to the suit. The other two students involved in the disruption were not punished similarly, the suit said.

Although district administrators said at the time of the incident the boy freed himself from the tape during the class, the lawsuit states that a classmate freed the boy.""",t2_335u1g4y,bringbackfax,0,1648574824.0,0,t1_i2l89ke,i2l89ke,True,Grammarnatzie,t3_tqvm3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnnArbor/comments/tqvm3r/abbot_elementary_incident_in_early_2000s/,Abbot Elementary incident in early 2000s,/r/AnnArbor/comments/tqvm3r/abbot_elementary_incident_in_early_2000s/i2l89ke/,19,r/AnnArbor,0,19
