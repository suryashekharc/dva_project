"@saraZinNYC @chellafan2016 u salty bros?

How many semi-affordable apartments do you really think are unlivable for ‚Äúlocals‚Äù as a direct result of remote workers?  The reality is, market conditions broadly caused massive increases in rent / inventory shortages - and remote workers are just one small piece contributing to the problem. 

Also‚Ä¶ many of them already owned property here and started working remote in the valley as a result of the pandemic.  So the whole ‚Äúthey‚Äôre contributing to the housing crunch‚Äù argument is suspect at best.

Remote workers help stimulate the economy here, and apart from that, why wouldn‚Äôt we welcome people who moved here to enjoy the same passions as ‚Äúlocals‚Äù? 

Everyone who lives in Aspen/RF Valley is hustling in their own way, and the fact that remote workers‚Äô hustle doesn‚Äôt involve a brick and mortar store in Aspen shouldn‚Äôt invalidate their being here whatsoever. 

Sound to me like both of y‚Äôall are salty at people who make more money than you

You may even consider Redstone. The views from Avalanche ranch are great. The town is cute but not much going on.

Also, the cabins at Chatauqua in Boulder are amazing. They even have themed ones that are historically accurate. Youd be at the base of the flatirons. Keep in mind Boulder is a busy college town. But youd have plenty of hiking and well priced meal options.

I'm just clarifying that this is an STR, vacation play but they're going to pay a market premium, since as several have noted there's not much for sale at the moment, and then sit on it for a period of years, having the property generating no income -- so they're buying STR, vacation properties but not actually participating once they own them, if I follow.
I understand the hassle factor dealing with the towns, but it seems like not doing so would affect the returns significantly -- buyer is basically assuming that there's a huge bump in the price several years down the line, sufficiently large to ignore rental income.

Cache cache has good food & is near other good restaurants Like jimmy‚Äôs. I haven‚Äôt been but know the chef & some people who work there. White House tavern is very good & very popular not your biggest splurge also a chain apparently. Matsu if you like sushi type stuff can‚Äôt go wrong but expensive. If you want adventure the Krabloonik & Pine creek are good choices. I‚Äôve grown up here & id say that Matsu seems like the most classic splurge place or if you have money a go 2.

Reason why is because of how beautiful this place is, and how accessible it can all be.  
  
All this being said, you should absolutely pursue this curiosity and see if you can develop it into a talent. Don't see the others as competition, that's a corrosive approach. Try to connect with locals who's work you aspire towards and seek advice. You're surrounded by a wealth of knowledge, it's up to you to tap into it.

"Comments on what others have said

1. pine creek- made comments below
1. cloud nine dinner-- another fun experience. The ride up/down in the cat is cool. Dress appropriately- it can be a cold trip in the cat assuming they are still using one without an enclosed passenger cabin. You will smell like diesel exhaust unless the wind is cooperative. The food is marginal unless something has changed in the last year. Definitely a fun experience, but you go for the unique nature of the experience/party, not the food. 
1. Matsuhisa-- you can have a great meal. You will want to get a reservation in the basement. If you have trouble with that, the bar/sushi bar downstairs is first come first served and is great as well. For a splurge meal, I would go elsewhere if all I could get was an upstairs reservation and didn't want to wing it for the bar.

Other options

1. Platos has outdoor private igloos. Neat place to dine, but really only good for a group. Food is okay, but not wonderful given the price point.
1. The wild fig is a more intimate experience. I enjoy the food there.
1. Aquolina is less of a 'splurge meal' but I do really enjoy the food there.  
1.

"The Pine Creek Cookhouse is worth a look. The food's been great the times I've been there, but the main selling point is the location.

"I am from Texas and only have been here 3 years so its defenitly not tons of snow driving experience that enables me to drive that way. However I defenitly know my truck at this point and how it handles on all surfaces. I defenitly am not braking in turns too often as I dont think thats safe, I perfer to pick a speed around 60mph ish and go through everything at that speed no braking unless for traffic and then I will streight line brake also utilizing engine braking if necessary. The build I have is apparently pretty comfortable taking the mild curves between Basalt and Snowmass. I will slow down to match speeds when approching slower traffic blocking both lanes and after that I assume I can only brake as much as the guy in front of me can so that alleviates any fear of someone slowing down so quickly I cant match their rate of deceleration. I have braked slightly in turns to match other peoples speed however its never a hard brake and I always avoid that.

So another theory for why the south bound is clear and the north isnt is maybe because between 6am and 11am there is heavy traffic coming into Aspen so those cars help clear some of the snow making it a cleaner drive. Then the first major wave of people leaving happens around 3pm so while they have plowed and cleared alot of the snow and ice its still not as clear as after 1000 cars drive over it.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Im not personally involved in laying down salt/sand/chemicals so I can only make assumptions here. I assume they only have a certain number of people to clear the roads and they dont want to overwork them. I would also assume they have a set level of snow/slush/ice that they deem acceptable. Also I would assume they have a certain amount of sand/salt/chemicals that are deemed acceptable for environmental impact and they spray them where they find it necessary. 

I almost feel as if you and I are driving two different hwy 82s based off the info you have provided. Ive always seen the left lane pretty clear atleast two tire tracks clear with some slush around the edges for a few days after a snow day. Ive seen alot of places where snow on the sholder is just normal durring the winter but im sure different places have different snow clearing practices. I also dont see many people crashing out or even sliding through turns (the most I saw is RWD vehicles applying too much power and spinning their tires a bit until TCS kicks in a second later). Not saying what you are experiencing isnt happening just that I havent seen that. 

I dont think they are supposed to completly clear the roads to where its basicly summer quality traction. Thats why we have signs everywhere in October and November thats like ""hey winters coming make sure you vehicle is ready"". We also have a great public transport system in this valley so you dont have to risk it on a very snowy icy day. Tbh if it starts snowing at 7pm I dont want the plow guys to get out of bed and start plowing the roads, I would perfer they enjoy their dinner ect and deal with the snow in the morning.

I know its a weird suggestion but if you have the capital and love to drive all season I would suggust you get a 2010+ toyota tacoma trd sport or better put a heavy camper shell on the back and cooper AT4 offroad tires on it.

"Well most of the people living in those multimillion dollar mansions arnt driving to glenwood very often and mostly fly in and out of Aspen only using that mansion as a second+ property. So it makes sense they wouldnt care, as for the rest of us we either use public transport, are used to driving roads that make 82 look nice even on a bad day or are going 20mph in the left lane. Its really not so much of an issue to the tax paying residents as much as it is one for the tourists/tunnel rats. Icy roads come with the territory and they really do alot to manage them just probably not as much as you may be used to. 

Either way you should winterize you BMW with AT/snow tires and maybe some sand bags in the trunk for your own safety. Maybe also go to an empty parking lot after a snowstorm and get comfortable with the feeling of sliding,  the amount of power it takes to lose traction and the braking distance durring these conditions. 

Also I would perfer the least amount of chemicals/ forign sediments going into our rivers as we are pretty close to head waters.
