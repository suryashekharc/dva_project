Second this! We live nearby and it’s an off leash area.

"I would recommend Dewey Dog Park near Midtown Crossing. They have a small and big dog section.

They have pup snacks/meals. For the parents, they have a selection of beer and cocktails. I would definitely check out their webpage and create a profile. You have to submit paperwork for your pup before you go visit them. Hope y’all have a lot of fun!

Edit: I forgot to mention to keep an eye out on the Parks and Rec section of the city public pools.

"My attorney and I reported her to the bar, too. I also eventually spoke to the court administrator. They don’t care. I’m usually very reluctant to complain, especially under those circumstances, so it tells you a lot that I spoke up. I’m convinced that she has people in her pocket, for one reason or another. 
One possibility: she’s an (ahem) “recovering” alcoholic (though people in Omaha who I’ve met that know her have a lot to say about how THAT’S going, LMAO.) 
She has done some work in the past through the courts in some capacity for people with addiction, and the court may love her for that; that she can do no wrong because she did one thing right.
Another possibility: Omaha is a big catholic town, and she is or at the time I dealt with her, she was married to or booed up with an attorney who was also a local deacon. A lot of wealthy families in Omaha are catholic, so maybe that gives her some pull. Who knows.
(I saw some of his social media, by the way, and he was about as vile as she is, just louder and less polished. He eventually ended up having his attorney’s license suspended because he forged signatures and took unauthorized and excessive fees. 
These two live/lived together. I can’t help but believe that folks who live together who share the same career have to know when the other is up to no good, and perhaps even support it.)
The last, and worst possibility, is that money or other favors are changing hands. Judging from what I saw over those eight years, the senselessness of it, and how she didn’t even try to hide her appalling behavior, and everyone behaved as if it was perfectly fine and normal, this would not surprise me.

"You’ve really got three options:

1.  The best. Yoshitomo. It’s the coolest and the best overall. It pushes the boundaries on sushi with some pretty skilled and creative techniques. I know people compare it to umami and pretend they’re  on the same level but it’s really not. If you hit their regular staple rolls? Sure. Kind of the same. The shit they do for specials is crazy. I got a roll that came with some sort of fish skin that was literally wiggling like it was alive for minutes. Creepy as fuck. Cool as fuck. It’s not just the coolest sushi restaurant in Omaha but the coolest overall. 

2. Not cool but great quality. Umami. It’s kind of like yoshitomo if you took away all the cool and edge and just want well executed sushi served out of an old godfathers pizza location that has only mildly upgraded ambiance. Not all that cool but I wouldn’t discount their quality. You also have to go to a fast food strip in Bellevue which is about the polar opposite of what you’d be looking for if you want a cool spot.

Well if you're going to use official city maps the McDonald's itself was in the yellow zone. But since you seem to think North Omaha is some sort of monolith to racism I don't think facts are going to mean much to you. North Omaha is an area with a rich cultural heritage and tons of amazing places despite a fucked up city trying to keep them oppressed. You're the only person in this thread equating crime(in the form bullet holes) in a McDonald's bathroom to being tied to North Omaha(which geographically according to city maps this area is not apart of) and also racism. Weirdly enough I'd imagine 90% of the patrons at that McDonald's are rich white kids from Creighton.

"It's not like bed bugs and roaches have an agreement to inhabit the same places, however the chance of having bed bugs is higher when there are roaches around, just because of the filth that both types of bugs prefer to breed in/around.

And yes, bed bugs are the hardest things to get rid of. A neighbor of mine had them and they eventually migrated to my apartment. They were a nightmare, and I finally got rid of them by basically throwing all of my possessions away. 

Also, there is a good percentage of people who aren't affected by bed bugs either, so a lot of the time you won't hear about them, because some people aren't bothered by them/never see them.

"Omaha has this weird little thing with 72nd St (or 84th St, or 108th St) being the dividing line between where people with a higher income level live and people with a lower income level live.  People who will tell you to not live east of 72nd St are implying there’s a higher amount of crime in that area while people who will tell you to not live west of 72nd street are implying that everybody living west of that street are rich and/or conservative assholes.  

I’ve lived here for most of my life and have found that for the most part, most of this city is safe.  And there are people that live west of 72nd St that have lower incomes than those who live east of 72nd St.  Also, there are a lot of people that live west of 72nd St who aren’t rich, entitled assholes or conservative.  

Personally, I would say some areas to kinda be leery of is pockets of NE Omaha and the area around 108th & Maple. For whatever reason, that area can be a little sketch.  Other than those areas, any area you choose to live in this city should be safe and it’s likely you’d experience few, if any, issues with crime. 

There’s nice people all over this town and there’s assholes all over this town. Neither is really segregated  by any kind of geographic feature.

"Somewhere else in this thread someone mentioned that it would have been much better to have a 16 year old deliver that message.  I think people are giving way too much credit to a significant chunk of the GOP voter base in thinking that's true.  A whole lot of Americans are simply not capable or not willing to engage in the level of introspection and reflection that most of us take for granted.  Anybody that still can be moved off the fence or over to the right side of it is not going to care about a teenager or young adult no matter what they say or how they say it.  But a crying kid is going to hit home for some of them.  She's going to be miserable off camera too, but at least now her plight isn't ""out of sight, out of mind.""


She was very brave to get up there and deliver that message.  I also think that her actions will bring her comfort when she's looking back and trying to process all of this.  She took a stand and did something productive to help her people.  That's more than any of the armchair quarterbacks in here (myself included) can say.

Follow them on Instagram: #kerticandleco

They just got a ton of intention candle kits in Next Millennium. (Intention candles are not scented) 

Each scented candle is hand poured, and highly scented to really illuminate your home. 

They're also working on coming out with bath bombs headed toward those with sensitive skin, so kid and baby safe! The Etsy will have an option to pre-order today.

These candles are great, I honestly can't rave about them enough. The Lavender Lemonade is my personal favorite, and the House To Myself scent is becoming a customer favorite as well! The spring scents are great right now with it STILL cold outside, so why not bring a little spring warmth inside?

"Well, Omaha police *did* come out today and say that this person may be connected to another sexual assault from 2021.

They made a statement saying information on social media was only rumors, but then immediately said that the two cases may be connected. So there's a whole lot of confusion on my part, are the social media rumors based in some truth, or is it just a coincidence that someone said there's a serial rapist, and this guy just so happens to maybe be related to another case?

"https://urbanplanning.cityofomaha.org/images/stories/Master%20Plan%20Elements/downtown_omaha_2030_web.pdf That's true. The ?2010? Downtown Master Plan under Suttle does state:

""Replace the W. Dale Clark Library with a new corporate tower.•
The revenue from the sale of this block could be utilized for
construction of a new high-tech, right-sized main branch
library in a new, more strategic location""

In terms of the CIP, it doesn't look like information on the downtown library replacement was included until 2018. Which included this text:

>A new downtown library will be constructed to replace the aging W. Dale Clark Library. The new facility would be constructed at or near the existing library site.
The facility would provide primary service to area residents as well as serving the downtown workforce. It could be in a mixed use setting with the public library occupying the ground floor. This project conforms with the Downtown Master Plan (2010), which recommends replacing the W. Dale Clark Library with “a new high-tech, right-sized main branch library.

"A couple things that might be worth talking about here:

*One of the things that Dawaune is referencing is that the proposed site for this project was initially two blocks ~~West~~ North on a different property. For whatever reason, it sounds like the city wouldn't have approved that site, but would approve the site where the library currently stands. (I don't really have a good source for this, however.)

*To add context to this, the mayor was generally is a proponent of moving the main branch of the library out of the urban core. Their plan to essentially rent a space for $500,000 a year instead doesn't inspire confidence in the concept of a permanent downtown branch of the library. 

*I don't really hate the use of TIF. It basically allows a tax break for 15 years at previously assessed values, after which point taxes will increase to normally assessed amounts. So 15 years after building a structure, the city would be able to make more money from it. https://planninghcd.cityofomaha.org/tif has some more information.

I believe his overall point is that instead of selling public lands and spaces that TIF should be approved if the tower was built on the initially proposed site, but not in the case of selling this particular property owned by the city.",t2_atqi2iwt,PaperHandLuke,0,1648748802.0,0,t1_i2vijej,i2vijej,True,mycatisanorange,t3_tt2lfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Omaha/comments/tt2lfb/man_performs_a_poem_for_city_council_in/,Man performs a poem for City Council in opposition of Mutual of Omaha TIF,/r/Omaha/comments/tt2lfb/man_performs_a_poem_for_city_council_in/i2vijej/,26,r/Omaha,0,26

"The issue with this is the fact that the places that ARE hiring are hiring for positions that don’t work for a lot of peoples life dynamics (working overnight/until 3-4am), only hiring part time and getting little to no hours a week, and overworking employees to a point where NO one wants to work for them. 

I’ve also seen a lot of “Now Hiring!” signs, they’re everywhere. But those signs stay up for weeks after a ton of people apply and the business either doesn’t respond/doesn’t reach out to let someone know whether they want to do an interview or not. 

I applied at Scooters two years ago and I have prior barista experience (2+ years). I got an email one month ago asking if I’m still interested.

"Not sure exactly what type of issues you want to work on, but check out the Attachment and Trauma Center, and don’t let the intense name or the smiling headshots scare you off. Their therapists deal with everything from depression, anxiety, grief, family therapy, addiction, and everything in-between. I have a favorite off the top of my head, but based on what you want to work on maybe scroll through the site and see if someone might be a good fit.

Above all else, when you find a new therapist I recommend being upfront with them and telling them off the bat that you want a no-nonsense, tough love kind of relationship to open up. It’s the same as working with a personal trainer- some people excel when they get their ass kicked, and some people do best if they get their hand held!
