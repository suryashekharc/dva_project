"As mentioned, the Bechler region is tough for obtaining backcountry permits.  There is a reason. It's an incredible area with amazing waterfalls that most people who never leave their cars get to see.

Depending on your fitness level and your willingness to get an early start, a great hike would be an out and back to Union Falls.  It's the second highest waterfall in the park and only reachable by foot. If you go, leave time for the Scout Pool as well. It's not in all the trail guide books but it's very worthwhile. It's only about a quarter mile ""out of the way.""  It's downstream from where a hot spring mixes with a creek. Sitting in that pool will give you the best massage you'll ever have. Perfect for a long trail day.

Another beautiful hike in the Bechler region is Terraced Falls.  It's a half day out and back hike with incredible waterfalls the whole way and a huge reward at the turnaround.",t2_i0n5d7om,Just_Looking_Around8,0,1649013730.0,0,t1_i39bxqj,i39bxqj,True,_kurtvon,t3_tvaw5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tvaw5q/best_spots_to_hit_in_yellowstone/,Best spots to hit in Yellowstone?,/r/yellowstone/comments/tvaw5q/best_spots_to_hit_in_yellowstone/i39bxqj/,1,r/yellowstone,0,1

"When are you going?  If you're looking for accommodations inside the park for this summer, good luck.  Everything is booked solid.  You'll have to hope for cancellations that happen to coincide with your trip dates.

Under Canvas is not in Yellowstone. Since you'll have to enter through the west entrance, you'll need to be up early to beat the crowds. According to the map, you will be an hour from Old Faithful. But that does not take into consideration backups at the entrance gate and bison jams. This year there is the added factor of lots of road construction in the park. Be aware that it could easily take 3 hours or more to get to sights like Old Faithful, especially if you don't get an early start.

As many people often say on here, Yellowstone is much larger than people realize. It can take a long time to get from one area to another.

Don't be afraid to hike more than you have indicated. With proper bear awareness and gear, you'll be fine, especially with kids. This is one of those cases where you want your kids to make lots of noise on a hike. Talking, singing, clapping and generally making constant noise will warn bears of your presence. You only have to go about a mile from any parking lot to escape 90 to 95% of the people.

"If you've never been, Yellowstone is much bigger than you think, larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined. The roads are 2 lane with a top speed of 45mph. Factor in a traffic jam anytime wildlife is by the road and you are guaranteed slow travel. Bring clothes for cooler temps, at night it will be in the 30s and frost is not uncommon. 

Summer means crowds, so you'll want to get a jump on the day to beat them. We always have breakfast in the room and eat a picnic lunch at any of the many picnic areas in the park. We take advantage of the ranger led walks at the more popular spots, Old Faithful, Mud Volcano and West Thumb are particularly good. The park newspaper you receive when you drive in will have details. At any visitor center, ask about day hikes suitable for your family, some of those are ranger led as well. This is the best way to beat the crowds, a half mile down most trails it's a different world. Read up on bear safety, there are videos on the park's website.

"3 nights in Madison for acclimation to the elevation is good.  Your day hikes will help with that process too.  

This has not been a huge snow year - below average.  Year isn't over, but it will be easier to travel at the high elevations than you think (although I'd still expect snow caps and the need for crampons and potentially more intense gear if you wanted other summits).  For example, the top of Jackson Hole is 10,500 and the base is currently about 6' of snow.  So that may make things easier.  But that snow levels can vary dramatically year from year is why a lot of books note ""it depends"" and can't tell you with certainty what is doable on a particular date. 

Yellowstone will provide a lot more updates on the backcountry in the summer: https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/situationreport.htm  
You should visit a ranger station while in Madison to finalize your hiking plans and get the latest assessment of what is open.

"Stick to the Northern side of the park. You could probably do Slough Creek to the Buffalo Fork Trail, take take that out of the park to the Buffalo Plateau trail, take the bridge over Hellroaring creek and do the Black Canyon to Gardiner from there.

I don't have a map with me right now but that should be in the 50-60 mile range and avoid most major river crossings. Black Canyon is a popular early season backpacking route for that reason, but better suited to an overnight unless you like to do sub 10 mile days.

>Also what happens if we reserve a backpacking trip and then the area is closed for some reason (bears, snow, maintenance)?

"I'm not sure of the timing but it might be best to drop them off at the horse tour and then head down to Grant with the car. Grant is at least a 3 hour drive from Gardiner though, so they'd be stuck at Roosevelt (i think I saw you post Roosevelt tour) all day. There are good hikes that leave directly from the lodge though, so that may not be a terrible thing. 

If you can book 2 different days then that would be better. Day 1- drop wife and kid off at horseback tour and then go hike or look for animals in Lamar Valley. Day 2- wife drops you and kid off at kayak tour then she and kid 2 walks West Thumb and drives up to Lake hotel area or whatever.

"This is not a bad vacation plan, please don’t ruin your family’s time in the park with a defeatist attitude.  Maybe I’m projecting, but my worst trips have been with people who didn’t want to go somewhere (and I’ve probably done it myself to others).

I would plan on a cold breakfast and lunch (I mean, something not cooked) so you won’t really need the camp stove.  You could cook your one dinner at a picnic site if you want, but given that you won’t want to stay in the park much after sunset anyway you could eat that one meal out.

"Google maps will give you an incorrect time in the winter because the road is closed.  It's about an hour drive with no traffic and no stops from West Yellowstone to to Old Faithful once you account for the entrance station.  In addition to being at Yellowstone during the peak of peak season, keep in mind that this is the 150th anniversary year and there are major road construction projects in several places in the park.  Expectation management will be key to having an enjoyable visit.  With only two days, I suggest choosing 3-5 things that you want to experience, depending on the time required for each, and focus your plan on those experiences.  Anything on top of that will feel like a bonus.  With visitation on the rise, traffic can be heavy.  For perspective, there was a weekend last summer that had a 20 mile backup going out the West Entrance in the evening, in which folks sat for 6 hours.  It is not uncommon to sit in a bison jam for 2-3 hours.  You can expect construction delays starting at 20 minutes each.  You've got the right idea bringing the camp kitchen.  The picnic areas are on the park map and don't  start getting too full until after 10 a.m.  Just keep in mind that all coolers, cookware, stoves, etc. have to be kept inside the closed vehicle when you are not using them, so make sure you're planning to have them inside and not on the roof.  I also suggest having a ""stuck in traffic for hours"" potty option at your disposal.  If you choose a major destination point like Old Faithful, while it is crowded, it is possible to park in one place for most of the day and walk to a variety of features.  Those areas will also have more accessibility options if you have need of them.  Eruption time is usually your best chance for shorter lines in the restaurants and stores, so once you've seen Old Faithful erupt, you can look at the next prediction and plan that as a time to grab an ice cream or a souvenir, or to use the restroom.

The mornings have been getting a little busier each year, as many are taking the advice to get out early.  Last summer there were a lot more folks out at 5 a.m. than I've ever seen.  As others have said, things really start getting busy by 10 a.m.  It is also worth mentioning that this was a low snow year, so the possibility for wildfire is definitely there.  Because cell service is practically non-existent when it's busy, be sure to look at the map ahead of time, and pre-plan alternate routes out of the park to your next destination in the event of a road closure.  I also suggest calling the road report line each morning so you are aware of any closures (307-344-2117), especially on your departure day.  It's awful reaching a closure point and realizing you have a 3+ hour detour to take.  This can also happen with serious car accidents, so it's good to check in from time to time as you are able.

What I typically stress to people is that during crowded times, it's important to agree upon a meet up place and time for each area should you get separated.  Children and adults alike get lost in the crowds and have difficulty finding each other when cell phones don't work.  If you need help being reunited, be sure to have a photo or description of what your family member is wearing.  These two things will take a lot of stress and worry out of your day if you do become separated.  It can also shorten the time that you are looking for each other significantly.  Just don't establish the car as a meeting stop.  There are so many nearly identical rental cars that it doesn't work well.  If you can get a distinctive windshield shade or put something obvious in the window, that helps.",t2_68ep3lef,DiminutiveDragon,0,1648507338.0,0,t1_i2hul25,i2hul25,True,SuddenlySilva,t3_tqc2l9,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tqc2l9/making_the_best_of_a_bad_vacation_plan/,Making the best of a bad vacation plan ?,/r/yellowstone/comments/tqc2l9/making_the_best_of_a_bad_vacation_plan/i2hul25/,1,r/yellowstone,0,1

"Get up *early*.  Some of the most scenic times in the park are sunrise, so there is a benefit to that.  But sunrise is about 6:10 am. 
 I don't know if there is a place to grab hot food in WY earlier than that; your better bet is to prepare the day's food the night before - bunch of breakfast bars and fruit and sandwiches and snacks for the car.  Then be at the gate for the park before 6 am.  You get up and get where you are going to before there's much traffic, and then you can spend a more leisurely time there.  Traffic will be worst after about 9:30 / 10 am - that's when the slower crews finally make it on the road, along with all the earlier risers.  

Also, with that in mind, if you can kind of get to a key area by about 10 am, you can hang out there for awhile.  So on your first day, you could hit up several of the geysers in lower geyser basin and the Grand Prismatic Spring, and then make it to Biscuit Basin / Old Faithful by 9:30 or so, and spend awhile there, and see old faithful erupt a time or two.

"Time in Yellowstone is incredible. As long as you get out early (6-7 am), you're fine. I've stayed in West multiple times. You'll get stuck in bison jams, but that's part os the Yellowstone magic.

One piece of advice, I don't think I've ever gotten from West to OF in 30 minutes. West YS to Madison Junction is one of the busiest stretches of road in the park. It's also some of the most beautiful. 

Bring your food with you, don't plan on eating in the parks. Plenty of places in West to eat dinner. Leave the park by sunset - there are too many animals on the road after dark.

"Just a little expectation management: Keep in mind that you are talking about visiting during the peak of peak season, in the 150th anniversary year, with some lingering supply shortage effects from covid.  There is also a major road construction project in the park.  

If you can get reservations, make sure you bring what you need with you from outside.  Even in West Yellowstone, the shelves can sometimes get a bit bare, and the produce in the park general stores is usually limited to iceberg lettuce, a couple of tomatoes, lemons and limes, and maybe some other fruits.  

You may want to plan activities near to where you camp, rather than risk spending a large portion of your 4 days in traffic trying to get to other areas during construction.  It really depends on your standards, but I'd say you can realistically see *some* of the major features with the time you have.   Make sure you look at the National Park Service website for the most accurate information on the road closures.  With the explosion of visitation over the last several years, much of the advice you will receive from previous travelers on ""secrets"" is outdated, so be sure you're looking at official outlets and vetting the information.  Expect heavy traffic, long delays on the road, and difficult parking.  It may be better to choose a few key activities close to your campsite, and focus on those with less time spent in the car.  It's also good to have a way for the kids to relieve themselves if you get stuck in an hours long backup, which is pretty normal for the West Entrance Road between West Yellowstone and Madison.

"Make sure you go to the park website (nps.gov/yell) to get current information.  If you're using third party sites like All Trails, know that it is not unusual for them to list trails that are closed and miss important operating dates and advisories.  With the anniversary this year, as well as construction and possibly some lingering covid restrictions, it will be important to make sure your information is up to date before setting out for the day.  Cell service is practically non-existent during the busy time of year, so make sure you're not relying on it for your safety.  I cannot stress this enough: no matter how responsible your kids are or how much you plan to stay together, set a meetup place and time for every place you go.  Know what everyone is wearing that day and be able to describe them.  It is not uncommon for families to get separated, especially in busy areas like Old Faithful, and these two things will help you get back together more quickly and with less worry.  

As for hikes, the Grand Prismatic overlook trail is very popular, and easy enough for most people.  Going early or late in the day will mean the trail is less crowded, but you will have a better view of the thermal features when the air temperature is warmer.  Cool mornings mean lots of steam, which can obscure the colors.  The Lonestar Trail will take you out to Lonestar Geyser, and it is shaded for much of the way, following along the Firehole River at an easy grade.  My kiddo did the hike out to Mallard Lake via the Mallard Lake Trail at the age of 8 and really enjoyed that.  This is a longer hike to a mountain lake, so plan an afternoon.

"I've stayed in Madison (during pandemic) and Grant (pre-pandemic).  I've never stayed in Canyon.

Madison and Grant are both nice, the main differences being related to size and amenities.  Madison has flush toilets in each camping loop, a very small store with some of the bare basics for camping and fewer sites.  It is closer to the main road, so road noise is very prevalent.  Grant has flush toilets in the campground loops plus showers and laundry facilities near the entrance.  It also has a well-stocked store (food and souvenirs), access to the lake, a pricey hotel, restaurant, better cell service (if that's important) and many sites.  It's much closer to the feeling of a typical private campground in terms of amenities.  The showers and laundry are re-opening this year.  So if those are important to you, then Grant is where you'll want to be.

Both are well-located in terms of the main attractions of the western side of the park, though there are many road closures and lane reductions throughout the park this year.  One of those lane reductions is around Old Faithful.  If you spend more time around Old Faithful and north of there, then Madison might make more sense due to the construction.  But since part of your trip includes time at Canyon, maybe the time you spend in the more southern end of the park would be best spent at Grant.  That would give you faster access to points south of Old Faithful, including the Tetons.

"The issue is bandwidth more than coverage. There is some coverage in Canyon Village (AT&T and Verizon) from a tower on Mt. Washburn, but there is extremely limited bandwidth to that tower. Using that tower at 6:38 a.m. one day in August last year while in the backcountry, I pulled 1.27 mbps download / 0.06 mbps upload, and it would have gotten worse through the day as people woke up. You don't have a prayer if you're trying to VPN into your company system.

There is absolutely no coverage, from any carrier, at Madison.

If you drive out to West Yellowstone or Gardiner, there is plenty of bandwidth and good coverage for Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile.

With the possible exception of Mammoth Hot Springs, the bandwidth issue is the same for all areas in Yellowstone with coverage (Lake, Old Faithful, Grant, and the areas that get coverage from Mt. Washburn).

As I recall, Mammoth Hot Springs has Verizon coverage from a tower that is in the park, but AT&T is via roaming on Union or weak spillover from down the hill in Gardiner. In Gardiner, AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile all have good coverage.

From Madison, you could drive about 2/3 of the way to West Yellowstone and probably have useful signal from outside the park. In normal conditions it wouldn't take more than half an hour. But if there is a buffalo on the road ... who knows.

I believe that the wi-fi at the hotels will have the same bandwidth issue, but don't know that first hand from recent experience. It was horrible when I stayed at Lake Lodge back in 2019.

Someone in the comments mentioned Cooke City. There is absolutely no cell coverage in Cooke City either. When I stayed there in 2020, I got about 2 mbps download in my hotel.

Group downvote to people who are lecturing OP on not using technology in Yellowstone. He/she explicitly stated in their post that they want to use technology in Yellowstone. Let him/her plan the trip they want to plan without the judgment.

"First, I am relatively price insensitive and we stayed at several in park lodges like old faithful and canyon. Second, the prices for groceries inside the park general stores were high enough for me to take photos of the prices. $7 butter! $12 for bacon! Selection was small. 

We brought a cooler and a portable dual propane stove along with camping kitchen gear, buying groceries outside and inside the park. We flew into bozeman and there is a costco next to a target next to a super market. 

We eat meat, but we also made pasta, omelets and pancakes, grilled cheese sandwiches, noodle soup, crepes (pre mixed at home and just add egg and water), those camping dehydrated food packs from rei, etc. Was part of the fun since then restaurants in the park last summer were sad. Every meal we bought I regretted it, including eating in the old faithful dining room. There are lots of beautiful picnic grounds. We never had issues finding a table. My wife bought a fancy tablecloth from one of the general stores.

There is also a grocery store in gardiner which is very close to mammoth so perfect from madison on your way to slough. Otherwise cody and west yellowstone are serious roundtrip drives. Jackson if you are down there also has grocery stores including a whole foods (and I am sure vegetarian friendly restaurant options).

The cowboy cookout was lovely including the horseride - but if I was vegetarian I wouldnt have been thrilled with the food. Budget permitting, there are other horse riding options. It is thrilling to ride a horse inside the park.

"Not to rain on your parade, but it sounds like a very frustrating way to experience Yellowstone.

Say you're done at 2:00.  Now it's going to be 4:00 until you get back to the things you want to see.  You'll essentially have two round trips per day.  So you'll end up commuting for work more than actually enjoying the park.

Stock up on your groceries outside the park.  A lot more limited inside.  But Madison is also very close to West Yellowstone, which has stores - you can make a run there; just time it so it isn't when there is a lot of gate traffic (I'd assume later in the afternoon is better but not sure).  

An important factor in seeing the sights is hitting the road early.  Get up and go; the traffic picks up later in the morning.  So pack easy to eat things like breakfast bars and such (or quick oatmeal to eat in the car).  But you'll be able to see all the big sights in that time frame (and get in some hikes).  Dawn (and dusk) is also the best time to see animals.

"Sounds like a good chunk of time! Madison campgrounds has bathrooms with electricity and flush toilets but no showers. Slough has vault toilets. Showers are available at Canyon campground, in Gardiner, MT at the laundromat, and the Mammoth Hotel and Old Faithful Inn used to have pay showers for campers but I'm not sure if they'll be doing that this year. You can call Yellowstone National Park Lodges reservations and ask. For a lot of folks the Old Faithful ones were convenient- just take your shower stuff and a change of clothes when you go to Old Faithful. 

Be sure to stop and get groceries outside of the park- if you're coming from the east you'll probably stop at Cody (East gate), Billings (if coming from the NE- don't wait until Red Lodge for groceries), or Livingston (closest big grocery store to the North entrance. Gardiner has a good grocery too, but Livingston has better selection) . All of those will have good grocery stores to stock up. Gardiner has a better grocery than West Yellowstone, so if you need to restock while you're in the park I would head out to Gardiner, just 15 minutes north of Mammoth Hot Springs.

"I was last there in summer 2020, so maybe the selection would be better now, but there wasn’t a whole lot in the way of fresh produce in the park.  There was always some kind of fruit, and a display of some things like tomatoes and onions.

Bread, granola bars, cheese, all manner of canned food, eggs, condiments, peanut butter and jelly etc. were all available in the park, but last long enough you should buy them outside.

I’ve never tried pro cook vegetarian in camp, but I’d probably lean on beans.  Dry beans take a long time to cook and camp gas isn’t cheap so go for canned.  Chili is an obvious choice, and you can cook cornbread right on top of the chili in a dutch oven kind of like a pot pie.  Measure out your spices and cornbread ingredients in advance (or use a box of jiffy) and bring it ready to go.

Eggs last for a long time out of the fridge too.  Hard boiled for lunch/snack if you’re into that, and obviously they work for breakfast.  I‘ve wanted to dump a jar of salsa in a pan and then crack in some eggs for a quick shakshuka, but haven’t tried it yet.

Sweet potatoes can be wrapped in foil and cooked in/by a fire, or the canned kind can just be warmed.  Canned greens are a good source of some nutrients, but try them at home first to find a recipe you like (maybe cooked with onions and tomato paste).

Mushrooms seem like an obvious choice too, canned.  Put them in the chili or whatever else.

Macaroni and cheese made with velveeta is easy too, though probably not enough protein alone.

Add extra nuts and sunflower seeds to your trail mix and I think you’d be well on your way.",t2_frz4y,Regulators-MountUp,0,1648020792.0,0,t1_i1ro4t7,i1ro4t7,False,Flewtea,t3_tklwsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tklwsx/feedback_on_tentative_plans_with_a_7_and_9yo/,Feedback on tentative plans with a 7 and 9yo?,/r/yellowstone/comments/tklwsx/feedback_on_tentative_plans_with_a_7_and_9yo/i1ro4t7/,2,r/yellowstone,0,2
We’re vegetarian but yeah a general rundown of what you ate/kinds of food available there would be super helpful! I’m hoping some basic produce and such?

"It looks like your questions about food wasn’t answered yet.

The general stores inside the park have everything you’d need at a price, so I’d highly recommend bringing as much as you can from home and stopping at the last real grocery store in Cody on your way in.  A decent cooler will keep meat cold enough for your first two days, then you can buy more at the general store or eat spam and peanut butter.  Let me know if you need any suggestions for food/meals.

The general stores also close pretty early - on our last visit we would visit the store closest to the sights we were seeing that day, rather than waiting until we got back to the one closest to our campsite.

&#x200B;

As for the other stuff - no one is going to complain about the smell, but it is nice to be able to clean up a bit.  For only 4 days I wouldn’t bother using the showers, but a washcloth can go a long way.  You definitely do not need to rent an RV and I wouldn’t put this off.

"What part of May? A lot of the park and hiking trails don't open until around Memorial Day. Expect some snow on the ground. Conditions will improve moving into June.

Late June and early/mid July are my favorite months though. Long days for hiking, the wildflowers really start to come out in full color. 

Xanterra Employee Dining Rooms (EDRs) have their ups and downs. If you're not too picky with your food you should be fine. Worst case the employee pubs sell pizzas which are decent. Bring a fridge and microwave if you're able.

Wifi is gonna suck since it's all satellite based. If you have Verizon, using mobile data / mobile hotspot is 100x better. Almost a necessity in my opinion, but if you're out socializing and enjoying the park you may forget about the online world, which is wonderful. Bring books, movies, and board games. It's easy to meet people, and the rec centers host various sports and even movie nights.

I'd ask what COVID precautions are currently in effect. There may be limitations to how many visitors can enter your dorm room. Xanterra was more strict than local governments regarding mask mandates, but I wouldn't be surprised if even they have relaxed some with CDC's guidance in the last month or so.

If you're willing to say what location/department you'll be working for, I'd be curious. I was in Mammoth Reservations but knew people in many other departments. Didn't know many NPS or Delaware North people though, just in passing. 

Many people are cynical about Xanterra but I found it alright. Short staffing in past years exacerbated issues, especially with the lack of international workers (J1 visas).

"Are you used to driving on ice covered, barely plowed two lane mountain roads that were built by the WPA in the 1930s where there is no cell reception to call for a rescue?  Tow is $700.00 and will take several hours for them to get to you, btw.

Do you have clothing and the experience to handle sub zero temperatures?

Almost everything is closed and only one road is open. And, that road is only open because it is a US Hwy that is the only way for Cooke City residents to get supplies in the winter because the Beartooth Pass is not plowed until Memorial Day -- not to give tourists a place to drive in the winter.

It's beautiful in winter and there are far less tourists. Lamar is stunning in winter, also Cooke City is a winter paradise.

It's also one of the most extreme places you can go in winter as the entire park is at altitude.  Tourists are CONSTANTLY getting in over their heads and needing to be rescued. 

I drive through the park to Cooke City every week and in three years have witnessed hundreds of cars -- including tour guides -- that have slid off or had terrible accidents.  It still blows my mind that the park lets tourists drive right by the ""snow tires required"" sign in Mammoth in bad weather in little rental cars that have no business on that road.

Unless you have lived in the mountains and have experience and the right vehicle to drive in very difficult conditions, OR have the money to hire a guide to take you through the park in their vehicle --- January is NOT the time to visit.

"I have to agree with everyone here. I don't see how this would work well. For one, as everyone who gets to the park realizes, everything is really far from everything else. So assuming you'll get back to camp by 10:30 means that you'll be needing to LEAVE the place you're at by like 9 or 9:30. I guess if you're prepared to get up at 4:30 (which, more power to you, I love it when I can pull that off in summer), you really won't have a lot of time to see the park.

You mention in another comment ""enjoying the wilderness while you work"". Unfortunately, my experience suggests that's going to be tough. As mentioned, Canyon has spotty service at best, and honestly it's a bit of an industrial campground. It's in a young lodgepole pine forest and the campers and trees themselves have reduced much of any undergrowth, so you're basically sitting in shade but visible to every other camper around.

There is no way to do this in the park. The best cell service in the park is absolutely awful. The wifi at the main lodges may be worse than the cell service.

"Me and my wife just came back from our honeymoon trip to Yellowstone about a month ago. It was so beautiful!

So in you’re set on staying inside the park, Mammoth is for sure the best option. Easily accessible from Gardiner, and you can drive to many of the attractions in the northern part of the park pretty easily. Getting to the interior of the park though would either require a snow coach tour, snow mobile tour, or cross country skiing/snowshoeing. 

If you’re not dead set on staying inside the park, I would recommend checking local Airbnbs in Gardiner. We stayed at a cozy cabin about 5 minutes from the northern entrance to the park, and it was extremely reasonably priced, it was close to town should you need groceries or toiletries, and there was a gas station nearby that was good for grabbing snacks and drinks for the road. 

As for the park itself, it is *COLD.* While we were there, the temperature never once went above freezing, and some nights and early mornings the temp (before even factoring in wind chill) was in the negative double digits. If you’re okay with that and are ok wearing 4-6 layers of clothes, you’ll love it. The park is generally sparsely populated this time of year. Sure, you will definitely see other park visitors and the occasional roadside convoy stopped to look at wildlife, but compared to how it usually is in summer, the park is dead in the winter. 

One thing we found nice about this time of year is it seemed to make it much easier to spot wildlife from a distance as they stood in stark contrast to the bright white snow.",t2_c2x6vy,Yondu_the_Ravager,0,1647914838.0,0,t1_i1m0xkn,i1m0xkn,True,matcroberts,t3_tjojc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tjojc9/my_wife_and_i_are_thinking_about_visiting_for_our/,My wife and I are thinking about visiting for our 10 year anniversary.

"It’s very cold but beautiful. My favorite time of year to visit. We snowshoe, XC ski, backpack but you don’t have to do that. Winter is a special time because there are fewer people and the wildlife come down to lower elevations so you see all kinds of wildlife. 
The road is open to Cooke City and it’s plowed once or twice a day, so I’ve never felt unsafe driving on it. 
Lamar Valley is great for watching wolves and other wildlife. 
You can take the snow coach to Old Faithful. 
There’s snowmobiling from West Yellowstone. XC and snowshoeing from many places. Sometimes we backpack and stay in the backcountry, but we are very experienced so that’s not an option for most people because Yellowstone is brutally cold in winter. 
But it’s magical. We usually stay at Gateway Yellowstone in Gardiner. Some of their units have kitchens so we cook most of our meals. Grocery store is just across the street. 
We usually fly into Bozeman and rent an SUV, and stay a night in town coming or going.  
Gardiner has limited restaurants and such in winter but there are enough open. 
We once ate nearly every meal at Wonderland Cafe when we were camping and it was cold rainy and snowing some and we were too cold to sit outside, cook & eat. They were kind and accommodating and the food was yummy.

"Sometimes there are signs at trailheads, not always -- https://www.nps.gov/yell/planyourvisit/bear-management-areas.htm

Definitely spend time in Lamar, that road is open year round.  Stay near Gardiner for easy access to the north gate. Most of the big geothermal stuff is a short walk from the road -- you are going to drive a LOT. Weather will determine where you can go and when, but the main park roads -- except for Lamar -- are on two big loops.

"2022 Spring Opening Dates  
Roads will open at 8 am on the following dates (conditions permitting):  
April 15: West Entrance to Madison Junction, Mammoth Hot Springs to Old Faithful, Norris to Canyon Village  
May 6: East Entrance to Lake Village (Sylvan Pass), Canyon Village to Lake Village  
May 11: Cooke City to Chief Joseph Scenic Byway  
May 13: South Entrance to West Thumb, Lake Village to West Thumb, West Thumb to Old Faithful (Craig Pass), Tower Junction to Tower Fall  
May 27: Tower Fall to Canyon Junction (Dunraven Pass), Beartooth Highway

(that’s from the NPS Yellowstone site)

So, from April 15 to May 6 around half of the park will not be accessible, but the big sights will be.  You’ll have to stay in Gardiner or West Yellowstone, which are the closest towns to the park anyway.  Gardiner is very close to Mammoth which has thermal features but not the big geysers, West Yellowstone is closer to Old Faithful, Grand Prismatic, and most of the other geysers.

I wouldn’t be surprised if many of the trails are still covered in snow.  The roads should be plowed, but drifts may form in some places.  The roads headed to the park equally so.

"There are a lot of good suggestions here.  One big consideration is the size of the rig you'll be driving around the park.  If you're driving your RV around, you will find parking to be extremely difficult at many areas, especially midday (10:00 - 4:00 or so).  Grand Prismatic is almost impossible with an RV.  Mammoth would be difficult.  Old Faithful probably isn't too bad because there is so much parking space.  Many pull-offs will be too crowded to fit an RV.  So if that's what you're driving  around the park, then the suggestions to be out very early are not just a suggestion but necessity.  (I don't drive an RV, so these are just my observations.)  

I'll second the comment about seeing Old Faithful at night.  I've seen two eruptions over the years during full moon and it's one of the most amazing things you'll ever see.

"As others have said, there is a lot of things to see in Yellowstone so you'll have to decide what you want to do.  The park roads are primarily a figure 8, and you'll be on the east side of the bottom loop.

From Fishing Bridge you are really close to Hayden valley - I'd do that one morning on the way to Canyon and/or Mount Washburn (I really like Mount Washburn, but maybe that's because the road was closed on my last visit so I've built it up in my memory).

Obviously you should go to Old Faithful, and probably lower geyser basin to see Grand Prismatic (hiking to the overlook, out and back from the Fairy Falls Trailhead is probably worth it).  You could either get to those by going out and back on the southern most part of the road, or make it part of doing the whole southern loop.

I like Mammoth, but it's a bit of a drive and with only 4 days I'd forgive you if you skipped it.  If you want to see loads of thermal features, Mammoth plus upper, lower, and midway geyser basins are the places to go.  There's also Mud volcano by Hayden Valley, West Thumb Geyser basin, and Norris Geyser Basin.

The Lamar Valley, reached by going North and then breaking off the figure-8 to the East, is another great place for seeing wildlife.  Hayden has tons of buffalo, but Lamar might have a bear or if you are lucky a wolf.  Go early or late for most animal sightings.

I would plan to see a sunset one day from Steamboat point or Sedge bay.  It's not too far from fishing bridge and will be nice to watch the sunset over the lake.  If you weren't staying at Fishing Bridge I wouldn't bother, and might instead see a sunrise at West Thumb or Bridge Bay.

I think if it was me I'd do:

* Southwest to Old Faithful and Grand prismatic etc
* North - Hayden in the morning, canyon middle of the day, Lamar a bit before sunset
* A hike somewhere - maybe Avalanche peak, Storm Point is very short, or a longer one to Turbid lake is all pretty close to Fishing Bridge.  Find out if any of those areas are closed for bear activity though - I think they may be in the spring (but I think Fishing Bridge Campground is closed then too).
* Mammoth - see the elk herd, some of the thermal features up there, get some park history at Fort Yellowstone.",t2_frz4y,Regulators-MountUp,0,1647599551.0,0,t1_i14xfkk,i14xfkk,True,Ok_Communication9243,t3_tgpjox,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/tgpjox/fishing_bridge_rv_park_we_have_reservations_there/,Fishing Bridge RV park.

"There is - at most - two options to get to any attraction from the Lake area.  And usually there is one that is going to be a lot more direct. 

Sunsets and sunrises in the valleys - Hayden and Lamar - are the best times to see wildlife.  Those are also times of low traffic. Mid-day is going to be the worst.  If you can, I'd say be up early and get going.  If doing Hayden valley (the closest to you), do that for sunrise, and then get to your furthest point (or possibly the one that will be most popular, so you see it with the fewest others around), and then work your way back.  If it makes sense, be back at your park at mid day and have a siesta, and then have a second shift in the afternoon / evening.

"Do you have any attractions you specifically want to see?

If it were me, I’d pick one main thing I want see each day then make it my priority to get there as early as possible. Once you get it out of the way you can kind of leisurely make your way back to home base and stop at whatever on the way. 

I would personally do something like:
Day 1: Drive through Hayden Valley and try to spot some wildlife. Hit up Canyon Village and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone since it’s relatively close. 
Day 2: Drive through Hayden Valley at dawn and continue all the up north to Lamar Valley. Stop for any cool animals or attractions on the way. Try to be in Lamar Valley for sunset but if your not comfortable making the long drive back in the dark then try to time it so you are back in Hayden Valley for sunset instead. 
Day 3: Get to Grand Prismatic as early as possible, hit Old Faithful on way back and spend rest of day walking around. 
Day 4: If you aren’t tired of driving yet, drive up to Mammoth then back down the west side of the park and stop for attractions along the way. If you’re tired of driving then just stay around the lake for a day and relax on your final day of the trip. 

It really depends if you are looking to see wildlife, landscapes, geysers or do some hiking.  I tend towards wildlife watching so my itinerary skews towards that a bit. 

If you do end up near the Tower-Roosevelt area around sunset, drive a bit west to the Petrified Tree. There is a little road to the tree and I have never failed to see a black bear there at sunset.

"Guess where Montana's laws about hunting and wildlife management came from...not the state wildlife biologists. 

And if a wolf spends 95% of its life in Yellowstone, where it is likely to become much more habituated to people (there are more people in Yellowstone than wilderness areas in the rest of the state), what would you call it? If a wolf has been collared for research in Yellowstone National Park, what would you call it? The population is doing great overall, yes. The hunting numbers across Montana are about on par with other years, yes. But 25% of Yellowstone's wolves were harvested this year. Those wolves are worth literally millions of dollars alive in terms of the scientific value they offer through research and the positive economic impact on the local tourism economy. 

Up until this hunting season, Montana had quotas in place specifically limiting the harvest in the 2 Wolf Management Units nearest Yellowstone National Park. That allowed for hunting throughout the state, it allowed for control actions outside the quota if necessary to prevent depredation, but accounted for the positive impacts those particular wolves had. Those protections are gone now, and wildlife biology will suffer from the loss of research subjects, as well as the damage done to pack dynamics in the area. I am not anti-wolf-hunting. It is an important management tool.

The Yellowstone scientists have decried this year's numbers.

"A sustainable, ethical harvest is supported by wildlife biologists, conservationists, and both parties (when those involved are familiar with hunting). However, this year the state of Montana chose to not engage in a management strategy, but an express elimination strategy. The problem this year was that as of the end of February, 8% of the wolves hunted in the entire state of Montana were wolves who spent over 95% of their lives inside Yellowstone National Park, and were hunted in an area that makes up .6% of the state. The harvest of these wolves sets back research, as many of those hunted wolves were collared and even when they are not, the severe disruption to pack dynamics that has already been seen this year has already limited the late winter study that Yellowstone biologists do every March. These animals are also worth literally millions of dollars in tourism: people come from all over the world to Gardiner, MT in the winter to wolf watch. They spend money on tours, hotels, restaurants, etc. The Yellowstone wolves are worth far more alive than dead. That also makes them more of a target for some of the hunters who are wolf haters: a Yellowstone wolf is one that will be missed, and is therefore a bigger trophy. I am emotional about this issue because the people who are supposed to represent this state and ensure an ethical, sustainable hunt are not doing their jobs, and are not listening to their constituents. I am pro-wolf hunting. It is an important management tool, and as someone pointed out in another thread, humans are part of the ecosystem too, and have been for a long time. We were historically the bison's biggest predator. But eliminating predators will lead to bigger issues with overgrazing, chronic wasting disease, young wolves without older pack members to teach them to hunt properly (which leads to an increase in depredations). Control actions taken on wolves who are harassing or in too close proximity to livestock are one thing.

"Yes. Problem is winter access is quite restricted to the tour operators.   There is a lottery for one daily pass for a non guided snowmobile group.  No idea on odds and what you might do different 

Most winter trips are set up to go from entrance to geyser basin or to the canyon.  Not many opportunities to do other trips as the roads are snow covered and facilities outside geyser basin are still closed.  

You could take a trip into the Snow lodge and then do your own skiing, hiking, snowshoeing from that lodge or take trips set up for the guests.  
However you are still paying for the trip into the park with one of the tour operators. 
Btw the snow lodge just closed for the season and they are shortly ending tours while they plow the roads — so when park reopens in April you can drive all the roads and do your own thing( within park rules 😉) and then you don’t need the tours 

However the guides know the activities of the animals and where good spots to visit, etc.  so sometimes it pays to get a tour until you make the connections.  

Good luck.

2) plan on 3-4 layers of clothing each day. Base layer = wicking fabric to take moisture away from your skin. Then (depending on how cold you tend to get) 1-2 mid layers. Even in mid-June I will take a long-sleeve thermal shirt and a fleece over it. Since I run hot, my fleece is a vest, but my wife wears a full pullover. Then, a top layer shell--preferably waterproof or at least water resistant. The idea is you can take off/don one or more layers to adapt to the potentially drastic changes in weather conditions at different times or elevations.
3) Google ""10 hiking essentials"" or something similar for recommendations on what to take hiking & decide what your trip might require
4) have a blast! You're visiting a slice of heaven 😁😁😁",t2_2zgn1i2n,piratwolf2008,0,1647202839.0,0,t1_i0j6el1,i0j6el1,True,ImaginaryEmploy9049,t3_td92sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/yellowstone/comments/td92sp/advice_for_a_beginner_hiker_going_to_yellowstone/,Advice for a beginner hiker going to Yellowstone in May,/r/yellowstone/comments/td92sp/advice_for_a_beginner_hiker_going_to_yellowstone/i0j6el1/,5,r/yellowstone,0,5
Bear spray. Also plenty of layers. warm socks. Water filter system if you plan on hiking all day it's easier than bringing gallons of water on your back. Warm sleeping bag.

"Bring snacks and water bottles.  There are a lot of water refill stations throughout the park but it's good to have a few full ones on hand.  Keep a first aid kit and bear spray with you.

Personally I'd recommend hiking boots unless you are just going to be sticking to paths that are paved or wooden (for example the paths around Mammoth Hot Springs).  You do a lot of walking at the park, even just to and from parking spots, and I've found that hiking boots make a huge difference in how your feet feel at the end of the day.  Good quality socks do as well.

You can download an official app that has a map and some other info like where to find bathrooms and gas stations.  Be sure to download it for offline use first because depending on your carrier you will get either very limited service or no service whatsoever when you're in the park.

"It's really not a good idea, bringing furry buddies into the Park.

The restrictions are tight. Which means you'll be leaving your pet locked in the car A LOT. You'll be distracted by thinking about their comfort, and cutting your experiences short. It's not a great compromise, it's a lose-lose, really.

Plus, even the slightest lapse in attention or control often leads to tragedy.

Just last fall (and this wasn't the only incident last year even) a young woman's dog got away from her at thermal parking lot. The dog died, and the last I heard (from November) she'd spent more than a month in a medically induced coma.

"My cousins and I swam in Hebgan Lake (just a few miles away from Yellowstone Lake) in the summers for my entire childhood (I'm 43).  My mom and her siblings did for decades before that.

But it was pretty cold in my childhood and we swam anyway, sometimes for hours at a time, and we never wore wetsuits, just swimsuits.

"I have hiked the CDT through Yellowstone, but it isn't really the best stretch of trail that region has to offer. Instead i would recommend looking at the CDT Big Sky cutoff alternate. That takes you along some much more interesting stretches of trail in Yellowstone.

Alternatively, you could create your own route by connecting some of the trails. An option that would take you through much of the park (and many beautiful sections) is  Slough Creek to Pebble Creek then hook up with the Thunderer (tiny road walk to connect them). Then take Cache Creek out to the Lamar River Trail, down to the Thoroughfare and out through the south of the park. Late summer and fall are most enjoyable for these areas because of mosquitos and river crossings in the earlier season.

"Such a fun project!

I know you are trying to narrow it down, but I feel bad for the coyote being left off the list! As someone who has worked as a guide in the park, people love to learn about how to tell the difference between coyotes and wolves, so a page comparing the two could be really great. 

For the birds, I would say stick to the ones that kids and novices are most likely to see- the raven, sandhill crane, bald eagle, and osprey. (Though a harlequin duck or mountain bluebird for color would be nice). People, especially kids, love to repeat-identify what they are coloring with what they have seen in real life. It all depends on what you are trying to achieve. Do you want to introduce people to the more obscure wildlife, or do you want to reinforce the connection to the animals they are most likely to see. 

I personally would include a salmon fly over any of the insects listed above, since the hatch is such a big recognized event by locals and a truly special time for anyone into fishing. I would also say the Mormon cricket is more of a standout insect for the region.

"You will want to pack for winter weather as the weather will be all over the place, plenty of chance of snow or rain and generally cold. I was there the second and third week of June in 2020 and we had many days of light rain, one day of over 2"" of snow and several warmer days. Same advice goes for pretty much every month of the summer. It's either hard winter or there's a chance of snow.

Edit: that sounds a little bleak. I have camped in the area months over the course of the past 15 years and don't recall a day of being ""rained out"", mostly just light rain that comes and goes, vs the day ending downpours we get in Florida.

Same advice for any cold weather: layers, waterproof, good sturdy shoes, avoid cotton. I really like to carry a rain jacket all the time, as they are light and great to take the chill off on a windy overlook. Plan on being outside all day.

Pack a lunch, pack drinks, pack snacks. I prefer a reusable water bottle and it's easy to find somewhere to fill up, but, I still like to carry a few gallons in a collapsible bladder or just plain old bottled gallons.

"A lot changed, not just due to covid. The hotels were understaffed at the start of the season, and it only got worse as the season went on, for a variety of reasons.

This year may be better in terms of staffing if the hotels can bring in international workers, but there is also more competition over those J1 visa folks, so they might still be understaffed. 

Additionally it's impossible to say how bad the covid situation might get this summer. If we repeat what happened last year there may not even be sit down dining available for parts of the summer. I personally wouldn't even speculate what this season might be like.
