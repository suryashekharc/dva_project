"I understand you. I wanted to be sure that I answered the question about cycling in Pensacola. Florida is consistently one of the most dangerous states to ride a bike and Pensacola has drastic room for improvement. I lived in Nor Cal in the late 80s and, even then, they had 10 times better lanes and respect for cyclists than Pensacola does now. However, it is improving. I've done several long multiple-week trips, including one from Jacksonville to San Fran and you can really feel the collective attitude for cyclists when you have people passing you for 8 -10 hours a day. Sorry to say it but, for me, the roads with the least street lights, least bike lanes, with drivers more frequently angry to share the road with cyclists are all in the southeastern US with Florida being one of the worst. This is why I left the bullet points. But, yes, to your point, try not to ride at night OR cross a random street on bike/foot in a dark area. Lastly, finding a few people to ride with is best as you look bigger in a group and are less likely to have problems. Tons of great groups to ride here with all skill levels.

"Pensacola is a set of islands connected by cars. There’s many places with high speed traffic, no bike lanes, and no sidewalks.

I’m a very casual biker. I can’t go fast. I can’t cycle on the road. I’m too scared to anyway. I just want to be able to go places. I stick to the sidewalks, but even then the sidewalks end or don’t have enough room for a bike.

"From what I understand, a local homeless person was panhandling outside of the store around 10:00 am. One of the employees asked them to move on - that they couldnt panhandle there. The woman moved on to a gas station down the street where she collected some moeny, procured a container, and purchased a small quantity of gasoline. She then proceeded back to the original place where she doused the cashier behind the counter with the purchased gasoline and proceeded to ignite her with matches. It is unknown if the cashier in question was the one that ran her off. It really got to me, the idea of my wife going to work and being burned alive. All of the chance encounters we meet, all of those people have their own lives just like me.

"As far as clubs and bars go downtown Pensacola is the place to go. There's Seville the most popular club. It's got like 7 different areas including a karaoke bar, piano bar, pool room, dance floor, balcony, and beer pong room. Another is O'Reilly's two floors. Full bar on bottom, half bar/pool tables on top. Wild Gregg's Saloon. A second floor dance club/bar. Mechanical bull. Play: a second floor bar with retro arcade games. Jordan Valley: Hookah bar/restaurant. (Food's pretty dope) Cabaret: Pretty cool gay bar with lit drag shows.
As far as daytime activities go we have the beach which has tons of stuff to do as well. There's the boardwalk with lots of cool restaurants and outside bars. There's glow paddle. Jet ski rentals. Parasailing. Obstacle course. All that jazz. We also have the Naval Aviation museum. It's pretty dope if you like looking at retired aircrafts. Pensacola lighthouse. Yes you can climb it. Fort Pickens: basically a giant pentagon shaped military fort from like the revolutionary War or some shit. Pretty dope. It's nice for photography.  Best places to eat are also downtownish some are some aren't depending on what you want or like. McGuire's Irish Pub is pretty fancy. A little pricey but it's worth it for a good steak. Lots of other high-end restaurants generally in the same area. Not so pricey but still good eats are Taqueira El Asador: awesome street tacos, burritos, quesadillas, etc. Lupita's: also has street tacos, burritos, etc, but they serve Mexican breakfast dishes. Sky's pizza: Great wings and pizza. Pizza slices are huge. Graffiti pizza downtown also has dope pizza as well as an outside bar.  Our mall is pretty cool but most people go to the outlet malls in Foley  or Destin. Both are about an hour drive so it's not far.  We have some pretty cool inner city  historic sites to. There's the ""famous"" Pensacola Bluffs. Basically a boarded hiking trail down the scenic route. Not that great but still cool at the same time. The ""famous"" Graffiti Bridge where Penske trucks and such obviously ignore the clearance height and periodically get peeled like a tuna can. That's always funny to see tho. Maybe you'll get lucky. Or if you just feel like being a delinquent and tagging shit the graffiti bridge is the place to do it at no consequence. Unless someone painted a beautiful mural(which happens often) tag until your fingers go numb. . .  Or you pass out from the fumes. Whichever is more appealing to you I guess.  Good luck.

"A bit far from you, but I have used Safe Harbor on Creighton Rd in Pensacola for many years. And I live in north Milton--it is worth the drive. I've used Scenic Hills for emergencies (2 emergencies--one dog, one cat) on the weekend and had great results and decent pricing. They are one of the few open on weekends, I think...

Animal Hospital of Pensacola on 12th--super high $$$$ but they are wonderful. Especially for complex cases. But I only used them once when I had a cat that was very sick. Staff was superb, though and I've read good things.

"I second Perdido Key Vet Clinic. 

I just had my dog spayed there, she's been seeing them since she was 3 months old. All of the puppy treatments and the spaying procedure were pretty standard as far as price (relative to other vets up North, where I'm from.) This was also confirmed by a friend of mine who's parents are both vets.

However, the one thing I'm not a huge fan of is they don't seem to approve Chewy requests (in my experience.) This means that I have to drive to the vet every 3 months to get Heartguard and Nexguard. I didn't follow up with them on this, my experience was just that the vet had never approved my prescription request and my Chewy order had to be canceled.

"While I don't think Best of the Bay is a ""scam"" per se, I don't know specifically how their voting works, so it's not impossible it could be manipulated. InWeekly seems to have some integrity, judging by their content - anyone associated with the publication can weigh in here.

What I can tell you is that those plaques you see on the walls of businesses are NOT cheap - I won one of the awards a few years back, and the paper informs you before publication and asks if you want to buy one. Given that there are a very large number of award categories, the business model feels more to me like class rings or National Honor society - it's not inherently immoral, but it definitely exists to make some money off people. That and the InWeekly issue that publishes the results is very popular - I am guessing it's their most highly circulated issue, and so generates a lot of publicity for the company.",t2_nip6p,remitroamer,0,1648524751.0,0,t1_i2it9cs,i2it9cs,True,UnionAsleep,t3_tqnwqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pensacola/comments/tqnwqw/is_best_in_best_in_pensacola_awards_a_scam/,Is Best in ‘Best in Pensacola’ Awards a scam?,/r/Pensacola/comments/tqnwqw/is_best_in_best_in_pensacola_awards_a_scam/i2it9cs/,2,r/Pensacola,0,2

Barns... There's tons around. Check out them all, don't just go with the first one you tour! 
- Ates Wedding Ranch
- Sowell Farms
- Barn at Water Oaks
- Camp Retreat 
- and there's a bunch more but I've worked at all of these venues and they're ones I think are good / great! 

Also, not beach or barn, but check out Supposey Venue, 5eleven, Live Oak Plantation, Barkley House

"Call Amore Plumbing, plumbing is a excellent trade. The thing is you have to apply yourself and actually work, get to work on time, and learn- be hungry to learn at whatever you do. I've been there in pensacola myself on the streets, its been 20 years since than but i made it thru, i have to give all Glory to God. To be honest, God is all you need. I was always searching for something or someone to help and fill this emptyness inside, drugs, sex, alcohol, just left me broke and hopeless. Jesus Loves you and God has a wonderful plan for your life, find a Church that teaches the simple truth- Jesus died for you, me, and everyone because we could never be good enough ourselves- He makes us righteous when we trust in HIS DEATH, BURIAL, AND RESURRECTION. Thats the Gospel, that is the best advice i can give you. This is coming from a man who spent most of his life on the streets and locked up in jail(to many times to count) and prison three times.

The website's not even accurate. I know there's no metered parking on Intendencia between Baylen and Spring. But the map shows metered parking. And what idiot decided to put all those parking zone numbers on the map, but not include them in the legend explaining what they are. Plus the map is only one small area. Where's the map for the port parking? Or the map for parking by Seville Square/Fountain Park?

"Just gonna paste this text from a strong towns article on the matter. 

the shoup test is a simple rule of thumb for determining what the market price of parking ought to be in your neighborhood. the answer is whatever price makes it so that there's just one space open on each block, on each side of the street, at any given time.

if we set the price to pass the shoup test, we make it so people won't cruise around the block looking for parking. if the price is right, it serves to calibrate demand so that people can find the space they need quickly, and those who are willing to walk a bit farther, carpool, bike, or take public transit are incentivized to do so. in addition, more convenient spaces (for example, right on the curb on a busy block of main street) will be priced higher than less convenient ones (for example, a couple blocks away on a side street) to reflect their higher demand, which will make them turn over more frequently. this is good for local businesses, who want those parking spaces to be available to their customers, not hogged all day by a single vehicle.

Here’s shoup on the startling costs of cruising:

A study of cruising in one 15-block business district in los angeles found that, over the course of a year, the search for underpriced curb parking created about 950,000 excess vehicle miles of travel—equivalent to 38 trips around the earth, or four trips to the moon. and here’s another inconvenient truth about underpriced curb parking: cruising those 950,000 miles wastes 47,000 gallons of gasoline and produces 730 tons of carbon dioxide. if all this happens in one small business district, imagine the cumulative effect of all cruising in throughout the united states.",t2_2q7tpgns,yallvnt,0,1648175749.0,0,t1_i20lyg3,i20lyg3,True,Corpsman223,t3_tmjqzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pensacola/comments/tmjqzd/city_is_considering_doubling_parking_rates/,City is considering doubling parking rates downtown.,/r/Pensacola/comments/tmjqzd/city_is_considering_doubling_parking_rates/i20lyg3/,3,r/Pensacola,0,3

They take the dogs out often and really interact with them during the day because it’s also a daycare. And they have a pool (that my dog was afraid of, but c’est la vie). They’re affiliated with East Hill Vet Clinic, so there’s quick access to someone if anything crazy happens.",t2_5teg97ei,yourerightaboutthat,0,1648010534.0,0,t1_i1ran9j,i1ran9j,True,sleeping24hrs,t3_tkfbu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pensacola/comments/tkfbu8/dog_boarding/,Dog Boarding,/r/Pensacola/comments/tkfbu8/dog_boarding/i1ran9j/,4,r/Pensacola,0,4
