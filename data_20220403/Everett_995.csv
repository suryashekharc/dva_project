"""EVERETT — Employees at two Verizon stores in Everett and Lynnwood are voting on forming a union, joining scores of other workers pushing to unionize nationwide.

If workers vote in favor, the stores would become the only unionized Verizon stores in the nation, aside from three in Brooklyn, New York, according to an organizer with the Communications Workers of America union.

“There’s really a movement of workers right now across the country and we’re going to be successful,” said Austin Hitch, a specialist at the Verizon stores in Everett and Lynnwood.

Workers at an Everett Starbucks store announced plans to unionize in February. And on Friday, workers at an Amazon warehouse in Staten Island, New York, voted in favor of creating the first Amazon union.

At the Verizon stores, workers want to bargain over staffing levels and pay, Hitch said. They also want advanced scheduling notice and a better work-life balance.""",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1649005261.0,0,t1_i38rb3r,i38rb3r,True,EverettLeftist,t3_tvdxq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tvdxq1/verizon_workers_in_everett_lynnwood_voting_on/,"Verizon workers in Everett, Lynnwood voting on union effort",/r/everett/comments/tvdxq1/verizon_workers_in_everett_lynnwood_voting_on/i38rb3r/,7,r/everett,0,7

"""The following is from the CWA:

EVERETT, Wash. (March 31, 2022) — After facing years of retaliation by senior management and poor working conditions including understaffing and unlivable wages, Verizon Wireless retail store workers near Seattle, Washington are voting on union representation in an official National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election. Voting officially began on Friday, March 25 when ballots were sent out to workers, and the votes will be counted on Friday, April 15. If Verizon Wireless workers vote in favor of forming a union, they will join hundreds of thousands of other telecommunications and customer service employees as members of the Communications Workers of America (CWA).

    Good morning, union kin! Our ballots are trickling in, and we are voting YES to joining with other @CWAUnion workers.

    Voting is open for a few weeks. Check back soon for updates on when the final count will be!

    — VZWUnion (@VzwUnion) March 29, 2022

Employed across two Verizon stores in Everett and Lynnwood, Wash., these workers are going up against labor laws that favor employers and aggressive anti-union tactics by the company. In fact, Verizon flew their in-house union-busting team to Seattle the day after workers publicly announced their organizing efforts and asked for voluntary recognition from Verizon on March 7.

Last week, 90% of Google Fiber retail workers in Kansas City voted to join CWA, resisting a similar union-busting campaign. As Verizon workers add to the growing labor momentum nationwide, especially amongst retail and hourly workers, and stand up against one of the most notorious anti-union U.S. companies, all eyes will be on this election and the sheer determination of these workers to organize.""",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1648822895.0,0,t1_i2zit53,i2zit53,True,EverettLeftist,t3_ttrv0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/ttrv0c/local_verizon_workers_fight_for_union_in_nlrb/,Local Verizon workers fight for union in NLRB election,/r/everett/comments/ttrv0c/local_verizon_workers_fight_for_union_in_nlrb/i2zit53/,2,r/everett,0,2

"The problem is, this kind of bloodthirsty rhetoric doesn't stay in theory: it seeps into the community, it leads to a rejection of due process, it taints potential jurors and corrupts chances for fair trials, it becomes inculcated into the police mentality itself to know that, should they decide to simply fulfill your libidnal wish for bloodshed, they will have the implicit backing and support of people who feel the way you do. It leads, for example, to justifications such as ""we felt threatened, so we had to kill him."" It also goes the other way: knowing that murder at the hands of police will be accepted, applauded, and justified, why should a criminal mitigate themselves? If they know there's a real chance they'll be summarily executed, they will be incentivized to take a maximal risk; in short, along with all the other evil it brings, this kind of rhetoric incentivizes the killing of cops.

I’m going to second the climbing gym, really neat people there who are always kind and happy to chill. The staff is super nice too. 

Toggles is a good place to meet a stranger here and there, the bartenders are usually able to give good advice on what to do. I make a new friend almost every week just by existing there. I’m always finding more people to rope into my shenanigans. 

Lucky Dime and Black Lab are fun and have sick shows, talk to the bartenders and the guests and you’ll start seeing some reoccurring faces.

Huntington Park Apartments is under new ownership through Everett Housing Authority (EHA) as of March 11, 2022. The purchase of this 381-unit multi-family complex marks another step for EHA in alignment with their strategic goal of providing affordable housing to the Everett community.

Current residents of the complex will not be affected by this transition of ownership and EHA’s hope is that they will benefit from the transaction, as the acquisition is part of a large-scale affordable housing preservation action. The property primarily services Everett’s workforce and residents will benefit from the location of this property with walkable public transportation, grocery stores, restaurants, entertainment, and schools all within a one-mile radius. This will provide multiple job opportunities and transit options for working families.

“We are excited about this and to be able to provide to those that need affordable housing in our community,” said EHA Executive Director Ashley Lommers-Johnson. “This is, by far, the largest acquisition we’ve ever made, and it has increased our housing portfolio by 25%. We wanted to make sure this housing is preserved for those in our community that need it.”

EHA worked with the KeyBanc Capital Markets’ public sector team to quickly finance the acquisition with a $118 million 100% loan-to-cost short-term debt. Simultaneously, EHA began the planning process of securing a credit rating and issuing tax-exempt bonds to secure permanent financing.

“We are proud to work with EHA to provide affordable housing for the Everett community. KeyBank has a long history of helping the clients and communities we serve to thrive.” said Tony Pass, senior vice president, KeyBanc Capital Markets.  “EHA is another forward-thinking Public Housing Authority demonstrating their ability to enhance service to its residents without the need for subsidy” added Sam Adams, managing director, KeyBanc Capital Markets. 

Huntington Park was built in 1991 and offers a range of amenities that include a fitness center, pool, dog park, and clubhouse across almost 14 acres. Future renovations over the next several years will include window replacement, parking lot repair and sealcoat, roof replacements, and unit renovations as units turn over.",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1648572125.0,0,t1_i2l145w,i2l145w,True,EverettLeftist,t3_tr7i7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tr7i7b/everett_housing_authority_purchases_huntington/,"Everett Housing Authority Purchases Huntington Park, Furthering Community-Focused Strategic Plan",/r/everett/comments/tr7i7b/everett_housing_authority_purchases_huntington/i2l145w/,2,r/everett,0,2

"My wife and I purchased our home(first for either of us) in May. We went through Bank of America and received two first time home buyer grants. One from Bank of America($10k) and another from Washington state($7500). We used most of the funds to assist with down payment and even closing costs. Our out of pocket to buy our home was nominal. We were able to immediately do minor renovations with our saved money that we would have other wise spent on closing costs. 

Two things to note, both grants had income restrictions. I believe they were around the $150k household income per year. The other thing, you will get taxed on the grants. Prepare to pay 15% in taxes on the grant money.

"This idiom originated in the ancient Mesopotamian Empire during Hammurabi’s rule in the 18th century BC. “An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth” was part of Hammurabi’s code. The full quotation from Hammurabi’s code reads,

    If a man has destroyed the eye of a man of the gentleman class, they shall destroy his eye.

This concept is also found in the Bible, specifically Deuteronomy 19:21.

    Life shall go for life, eye for an eye, tooth for tooth.

The shortened phrase, an eye for an eye, has the same meaning as the full phrase, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.


So are you a follower of Hammurabi or the Old Testament? If your answer is that you're a Christian (or any decent person, the bible got this one right), you should probably look to this:


    You have heard that it was said, ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth."" But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

"50% ami... Of the average household. Or fair market value, whatever is less. It's complicated but my point is this: low income households of 1 and parenting students are greatly impacted by the restrictions of this high barrier housing. 

It's a great improvement that will pay for itself fast, and I hope when hud is back in the green that they will invest in more mid barrier housing. Housing like 100% section 8 homes, housing choice vouchers from TLP clients, and rapid rehousing aid for street outreach programs (not just the years long 211 wait-list). 

The focus of these 50-80% ami properties is affordablity and eviction prevention. While I've only benifitted from 30-60% Ami housing, once my assistance ended I found better value per sq ft from regular rentals.

"While this is tragic it is not national news worthy unfortunately.  It has nothing to do with fitting the narrative and you don't hear about everytime a cop kills a suspect.  What you do hear about is when a cop (who is supposed ro be well trained and maintain composure in stressful situations) overreacts and take a life of a suspect.  Far too many times suspects have been killed while running away or innocents have been killed because the cops engaged in a high speed chase over something trivial, or (once again supposedly well trained officers) got jumpy and took a life.  

Once again and let me make this perfectly clear, I am not saying that what happened in Everett today is less important or less tragic than if the reverse were to happen,  but I can fully understand why someone in Maine would not care about it.

The complex at 9009 W. Mall Drive in south Everett has 381 apartments and is within a mile of public transportation, grocery stores and schools. The housing authority bought the property to keep rent prices affordable for people earning as little as half of the area’s median income, said the agency’s executive director, Ashley Lommers-Johnson. It means a single person earning at least $40,500 annually, or a four-person household earning at least $57,850, can afford to live in the complex.",t2_3m7h1y3b,flowersbloomglitter,0,1648219958.0,0,t1_i22l6v0,i22l6v0,True,flowersbloomglitter,t3_tnnn7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tnnn7p/everett_housing_authority_buys_381_apartments_its/,Everett Housing Authority buys 381 apartments — its biggest purchase yet | HeraldNet.com,/r/everett/comments/tnnn7p/everett_housing_authority_buys_381_apartments_its/i22l6v0/,11,r/everett,0,11

If you want to do something sporty then I’d recommend rock climbing. Summit I believe has groups and events and everyone seems real nice. 
There’s a wide variety of people who go roller skating at the Skate Deck but that’s closing soon. 
And of course if you haven’t been to a silvertips game yet then try giving that a shot. 
There are also running groups that do small group runs. 
There’s a pile dancing studio in downtown as well if that’s your speed. 

If you like live music then downtown Everett has several venues. Black Lab and Tony V’s tends to have 30’s/40 year olds.

"Democratic state Rep. Emily Wicks of Everett announced Monday she will not seek re-election, saying it’s time to reset how she serves the community following three satisfying yet exhausting years as a lawmaker.

The departure of Wicks and Sells sets the stage for potentially competitive primaries in a district that encompasses Everett, Tulalip and a large part of Marysville.

It’s long been a Democrat stronghold. However, it may be less so this year after redistricting added a larger piece of Marysville with its Republican-leaning voters.

“I find the 38th has a history of bleeding blue and I don’t think Republicans have a chance at either of those seats,” said Paula Townsell, chair of the 38th Legislative District Democrats.

Doug Roulstone, chair of the Snohomish County Republican Party, is confident the GOP is well-positioned for success.

“We feel like the Democrats have handed this to us on a silver platter with redistricting, and the mandates and the policies they’ve passed,” he said. “We think there is a better than 50-50 chance that we will win all three seats.”

As of Monday, Democrats [Julio Cortes](https://electjuliocortes.com/) and [Mary Fosse ](https://www.maryfosse.com/)and Republican [Mark James](https://www.electmarkjames.com/) had launched campaigns to succeed Sells.

"I'm not sure of any similar options in Everett currently, though I know of some bars in other areas trying to have board games in addition to some more dedicated board game venues trying to serve food and alcohol.

When the Broadway Alfy's reopens it should have space for such an event, but will likely only have a beer and wine license. You'd also need to organize something. The new Tapped Mukilteo or one of the area breweries such as Middleton, might have space for board games as well.

If you were looking for more traditional bar games like darts and pool along with stiff drinks and good food, there are several area bars which would meet that criteria.

"> The county’s new legislation removes prohibitions of detached ADUs (DADUs) on lots that aren’t at least five acres in the R-5 zone and 100,000 square feet in the RC zone.

I'm not feeling ambitious enough to go double-check the prior law, because it's tedious to find a specific provision in Snohomish County Code in the best of circumstances, and even worse if trying to find a previous revision.

However, I could have sworn the above is not new. I had looked it up when a big, new house was being added to a nearby property, and the existing house was being downgraded to an ADU to rent out. That example was over the 5 acre minimum, but I was fairly certain I had determined as a result of that research numerous other nearby properties smaller than 5 acres were eligible.

The rural ADU changes might be a moot concern in some areas anyways after the 2024 comprehensive plan update. Anywhere the urban growth area boundaries get expanded is of course going to be rezoned after the plan update is complete.",t2_zy16m,iamlucky13,0,1647313004.0,0,t1_i0pblcu,i0pblcu,True,LRAD,t3_tbfq9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tbfq9b/snohomish_countys_newest_backyard_cottage_law/,Snohomish County’s Newest Backyard Cottage Law Could Accelerate Exurban Sprawl | The Urbanist,/r/everett/comments/tbfq9b/snohomish_countys_newest_backyard_cottage_law/i0pblcu/,1,r/everett,0,1

"Obligatory late to the party but I just wanted to say that u/Orillious is absolutely right! The restrictions on gay and bi men are outdated and need to be repealed. It’s important to understand the origin of these restrictions so that it’s clear why we don’t need them anymore. This started in the 80s when blood banks has limited abilities to test blood. To deal with this, the FDA banned donations from gay men since they had higher rates of HIV. The technology from screening blood today has vastly improved since the 80s and now the CDC has ensured that all donated blood is tested for HIV as well as syphilis, and the hepatitis B and C virus. Obviously, this means that there is absolutely no reason for continuing with these restrictions. In 2020, the pandemic-induced blood shortage forced the FDA to modify the restriction so that a man had to abstain from having sex with another man for 3 months before he was able to donate blood. If the FDA had removed all restrictions on gay and bi men, the blood supply would have increased and we wouldn’t be facing this national blood supply crisis. You can [check out this article for more info](https://www.everydayhealth.com/public-health/blood-shortage-crisis-in-the-us-has-experts-calling-for-revision-of-policy-for-gay-men/) on how changing these restrictions would affect blood supply.   
Since the start of this pandemic, blood donations have fallen by 10 percent. Also, a lot of blood drives were earlier held at schools which has now dropped by a whopping 62 percent. The American Red Cross released a statement that it now has less than a one-day supply of critical blood types. This has forced doctors to make difficult decisions about which patients can receive life-saving blood transfusions. People often think that the blood supply is adequate because they see statistics like almost 7 million people in the US donate blood every year. This may seem like a lot but it’s only 3 percent of all eligible people. Furthermore, it’s important to realize that less than 50% of the population is eligible for blood donation – it’s currently at 37%. Approximately 29,000 units of red blood cells are needed every day in the US and according to the American Red Cross, every 2 seconds, someone in the country requires blood or platelets. It’s not just accident victims who require blood, people with diseases such as sickle cell disease depend on blood transfusions to survive. Many people undergoing cancer treatment also need blood transfusions. Blood donation generally takes about 45 minutes to an hour and you can get complete a RapidPass online through your local Red Cross to speed up the process. If you have never donated blood before, you can [check out this link](https://www.hhs.gov/oidp/topics/blood-tissue-safety/donate-blood/index.html) to the Department of Health and Human Services which covers everything from requirements, what you should do before and after your blood donation, what to expect during your visit and links to online locators to help you find a blood donation center near you.",t2_368kz76u,heatheruff,0,1647256514.0,0,t1_i0lreh4,i0lreh4,True,LRAD,t3_sajadr,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/sajadr/the_american_red_cross_is_facing_a_national_blood/,The American Red Cross is facing a national blood supply crisis – it's our worst blood supply shortage in more than a decade.,/r/everett/comments/sajadr/the_american_red_cross_is_facing_a_national_blood/i0lreh4/,3,r/everett,0,3

"It seems like Trader Joe's is paying tax on both locations according to the county assessor's records.

To make things even more confusing, Safeway used to be located where the Big Lots is now, hence the telltale wavy roof design at that location. The current Trader Joe's location is legally platted on maps as ""Food Pavilion"" aka Thriftway (presumably the Bellingham-based chain which also owned Stock Market/Cost Cutter) due to the initial use when the property was developed.

With Kroger doing a sell and leaseback of many of its Fred Meyer locations, WinCo is left as the only area grocery chain which owns the land under most of its locations.

"first. I've downvoted nobody in this comment feed, to get that out of the way.

I'm one of the people blaming serious drug issues for a lot of the problems, but victim blaming was not my intent. I'm simply saying - I can see how this is happening frequently in this area, as I've personally seen people very strung out, or potentially with serious mental illness, or both - placing themselves in very real danger... I barely avoided hitting a man who was stumbling down the sidewalk, then abruptly (without any indication he was about to, or even looking at the road at all) zig zagged his body into traffic, right in front of me. After I managed not hit him, continued to meander without a care in the world through 3 more lanes of traffic nearly causing multiple accidents.  These aren't even people ""trying to cross the street"" these are people who aren't even well enough to realize there IS a street...  


I've seen this same scene and similar play out dozens of times along that stretch of road. I think that's what most of the others are talking about as well.

Of course not every pedestrian related accident is due to this but, with it happening so frequently... its bound to cause accidents. and deaths. which is horribly sad. when I drive down that stretch of road I am always watching all the pedestrians like a hawk because there is a good chance one of them will not behave as expected, and I'm always worried one of them will just randomly step out in front of me without warning.",t2_3xtm7,snowpony,0,1646970391.0,0,t1_i075caf,i075caf,False,LRAD,t3_tb1j7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/tb1j7r/everett_police_shut_down_evergreen_way_again/,"Everett police shut down Evergreen Way again after another person hit, killed by car | KOMO",/r/everett/comments/tb1j7r/everett_police_shut_down_evergreen_way_again/i075caf/,3,r/everett,0,3

"road design helps if people are not so drugged up that they are completely unaware of their surroundings. this seems to be the biggest issue. the people i'm talking about are not bypassing safety for convenience, and trying to j-walk.. they are out of their minds wandering down the middle of a very busy street, giving absolutely zero f's about any of the vehicles around them.

"Someone else mentioned this already, but try to avoid going to the SeaTac airport at all costs. Traffic is a nightmare. The Everett airport will be much closer to you and the traffic is not quite as much of a nightmare. Just take I-5 to and from.

It's a rapidly growing city. There's a new Amazon facility being built on the border of Arlington and Marysville. A lot of new developments, especially in the area around 87th and Grove, which I'm assuming is where you'll be.

I currently live in Marysville and am in the process of moving to Everett. Overall pretty nice place. Expect a lot of rain.

"Welcome! Where are you moving from? I've been in and around Marysville a lot over the years and end up spending a lot of time there. It is quickly growing, especially in the unincorporated or newly annexed areas. Traffic can be bad if trying to commute to Everett or if one is unaware of some side streets.

Overall, Marysville is a very working class city even more so than Everett. A lot of the social life is centered around the Quil Ceda Creek and Tulalip casinos, the latter attracting a younger crowd. Cristiano's is a popular pizza and pasta restaurant that has reasonable prices. It used to have the top Golden Corral in the US, but the franchisee sold the business and the new owner wasn't able to keep the franchise agreement. There's a great taco truck on the Reservation (Tacos El Rey, which is not the truck near the freeway, but is the one about a quarter mile past the roundabout).

Typically people will either drive to SeaTac airport and park in an off-airport lot or get someone to drop them off at the Tulalip Casino to take the Bellair Airporter. The casino used to allow free parking up to two weeks for Bellair passengers, but I think that ended. Shuttle Express doesn't have the state's franchise/regulated rates for airport transportation north of the Snohomish River, so rates are even higher.

Nearby, Arlington is about 50/50 in terms of being suburban or rural. Granite Falls has a reputation for being very rural and low income (the new homes there contradict this) and Stanwood/Camano Island feels a lot more remote than it is. A lot of people forget, but there is some housing on and around the Reservation as well.

I'm happy to answer any questions you have about the area.

there is a driving range on 128th if you want to tryout golf a little or a lot.

you could join a gym, and get involved in some of their clubs for a  small nominal fee. Crossfire gyms are also a great place to meet some new folks and network.

">What many don't know, is the slow down isn't really from the ports, but from the trucks and rail used to ship the containers out.

Yes and no.   There are many factors that create bottle necks in the supply chain.  At the high level,  Supply Chains need to work in a predictable rhythm, or they can quickly overload a step in the process. 

What started the snow ball was obviously Covid. As the US economy adapted and was stimulated with cash to consumers and business, demand for goods soared. 

The Supply began to struggle when there was a sudden shortage of physical containers in China to ship goods to the US. Essentially,  more shipping companies routed their boats to run the China to US deliveries, because of the demand,  which changed the balance of how much supply could be on the water at any given time.  It's like drag racing between red lights, you get there quick,  but you're still going to wait for the green light.  

With the influx of more containers hitting the US, the inland infrastructure struggled to keep up.  Trucks, rail, 3PL warehouses, ect.  We couldn't move the containers fast enough,  which caused its own rippling effect.  Train yards in Chicago overloaded with containers, could not schedule more to come from LA/Long Beach, which meant their yards filled,  which meant boats sat in the water,  which means port congestion, which means containers not going back to China in a normal time line,  which means a shortage of containers in China,  which means Supply delays, which means companies buy more stock to cover the lead time,  which means more container demand,  which means rinse and repeat everything above.  

Sorry for the long rant,  but there has never been a Supply Chain storm like this ever, and for those who are in it, trying to calculate every possible impact,  cost,  delay, ect.... it's been wildly impossible at times given all the factors that create rippling impacts weeks later on the other side of the world.",t2_5rj4cg8t,FrontButtPunt,0,1646661194.0,0,t1_hzpbjib,hzpbjib,False,chattytrout,t3_t8h85l,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/t8h85l/port_of_everett_terminal_waiting_for_a_ship/,Port of Everett Terminal Waiting for a Ship,/r/everett/comments/t8h85l/port_of_everett_terminal_waiting_for_a_ship/hzpbjib/,4,r/everett,0,4

Peterson was trying to smoke drugs, according to trial testimony.

Meza told him to stop, thinking it could trigger a seizure. He testified this conversation went “not as planned.” He also claimed Peterson threatened to put him “to sleep.” Peterson did not threaten to use a weapon, Meza said in a police interview after the shooting.

Peterson punched him in the face, surveillance video showed. That footage was shown to jurors many times throughout the trial.

A fight ensued in the aisle.

Meza landed several blows. Peterson grabbed the other man’s hood. That blocked Meza’s vision.

The defendant felt a hand on his waist where he kept his gun. He thought it was Peterson’s hand. The security footage showed it was the hand of Peterson’s friend reaching in.

Within seconds, Meza racked the slide of his pistol and fired a shot into Peterson’s stomach. He told police the first shot was an accident.

The first 9 mm bullet sent Peterson to his knees, with his back to Meza. The defendant fired another shot down into Peterson’s back and through his right lung and liver. That bullet was intentional, Meza reportedly told police.

After the shooting, Meza could be seen on security video taking the magazine out of his gun and putting his hands in the air.

Meza said he was in fear for his life the whole time. Prosecutors argued Meza had no reason to be in fear after the first shot, but he fired a second one anyway.

Sturdivant called it a “senseless killing.”

“It’s as simple as this, ladies and gentlemen: Mr. Meza brought a gun to a fistfight,” he told the jury, adding later, “Nobody is saying Mr. Meza is a cold-blooded killer … What we’re saying is his decision to kill a man is unreasonable.”

The defense attorney, Leary, argued: “He doesn’t have to wait for Peterson to successfully further escalate the situation. He is entitled to act on appearances provided that he’s acting in good faith and on reasonable grounds.”

After a weeklong trial in front of Superior Court Judge Richard Okrent, eight men and four women convicted Meza of the lesser charge.

The jury made a special finding that Meza committed the crime while armed with a firearm. The sentence enhancement will tack on a mandatory five years to Meza’s prison time, Sturdivant said.",t2_343fh,LRAD,0,1646508493.0,0,t1_hzhif9e,hzhif9e,False,LRAD,t3_t7348r,https://www.reddit.com/r/everett/comments/t7348r/mistrial_declared_in_deadly_everett_bus_shooting/,Mistrial declared in deadly Everett bus shooting over prosecutor ‘errors’,/r/everett/comments/t7348r/mistrial_declared_in_deadly_everett_bus_shooting/hzhif9e/,2,r/everett,0,2

That second paragraph I quoted says ""the port estimates paying up to $1 million"" but then the third paragraph says ""The Lokey Group is responsible for redeveloping…"" so which is it? Hmm.

edit: Looking at the least pdf linked above, it is clear that **the port** expects to spend ""up to a $1 million"" just to get the building *ready* for the tenant to take over.

"This is a complicated question, especially since non-denominational means so many different things. People would also ask if you want to attend a church which permits women to be in the clergy or one which will perform same sex marriages, as the larger area churches are about 50/50 on the former and closer to 0% on the latter, though some will allow LGBT people to worship there.

I've known a lot of families who attended Northshore Christian Church near Boeing (it has a popular elementary school as well). The Evangelical Lutheran churches, such as the one by Forest Park, tend to be on the more liberal side, though some have an older congregation and most are big on hosting potlucks.

"Everett High alumni of ‘08 here. What I learned about our mascot, towards the end of my days there, is that the reason it’s a seagull. Back in the 40’s or 50’s (I think), they choose Sammy the Seagull to bring luck to games. They had a superstition, that whenever they saw a seagull fly over a field before a game, they had a better chance at winning the game. Even though seagulls are a plenty in Everett, but why not bring that luck everywhere you go? 

They did try and change the mascot around ‘07 or ‘08, can’t remember, and that was the story they gave. And the mascot still stands as, Sammy the Seagull.
