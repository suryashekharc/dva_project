I've done both Grubhub and Lyft in the QCA and Grubhub is way more profitable. The small volume of drivers for Uber/Lyft makes you busy but few tip. I made great money doing Grubhub.

"There's a significant difference between manufactured homes and modulars homes. I highly recommend doing your research before deciding. Manufactured homes can be placed on a foundation, however, typically are not and brought in on wheels and axel and placed on a cement slab. These can also be easily moved.

I only say covers because that’s what seems to kinda build the following/interest, draws people in ya know? Familiar music, then hit ‘em with the originals. I’ve been wanting to write some lyrics but I’m always struggling with the initial idea.. but I’m good at working off of an idea. Maybe we could write some stuff. Should come out next week to jam! I’ll be there for sure. I pop into guitar center sometimes when I can afford something I need lol, good idea for meeting people. Plus the gear discount I’m sure lol.

"Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 aka “The Peaceable Journey Law”  
This act allows a person to transport a firearm through states in which he or she does not hold a valid permit, as long as he or she may lawfully carry (whether by permit, constitutional carry, etc.) in the state of origin as well as the destination. The owner of the firearm must be in transit and not stay in the state where possession would be illegal. Furthermore, the firearm must be unloaded and contained in a locked box or out of the driver’s reach, unless state law allows otherwise. It is recommended that ammunition be in a separate, preferably locked container. In some states, the drivers must pass through the state without stopping, and in others only short stops are tolerated.

"If you want to get a jump start before you figure out where you want to get some formal training (which is a must with all the shit you actually need to know to be safe cruising down the road loaded to 80,000 lbs) you can always go to the DMV and pick up a copy of the study book and work book for the written exams.

"Downtown Davenport or Rock Island - gives you the option to walk to restaurants/bars. If you don’t drive it’s easy to hop on a bus. If you do drive and feel comfortable in the Augie area, the apartments above the old Cool Beanz building are really nice and affordable from what friends told me. Downtown Moline is pretty nice too, especially if you enjoy bike riding. The bike path out there by the river is really nice and gives good access to the rest of the QC - downtown Moline also has more grocery stores compared to Rock Island and Davenport (both are basically food deserts).    
  
Also idk, there’s very few neighborhoods around here where you’d truly be in danger (unless you’re obviously very wealthy). Most people in the QC are friendly and just trying to live their lives haha.   
  
Edit: between Brady and Harrison, on the hill but south of Van der Veer might be nice too. There’s one apartment building I don’t think I’d recommend but other than that you’d have 3 coffee shops in walkable distance, an Aldi, a laundromat if your spot doesn’t have a washer/dryer, gas stations, a couple bars, downtown isn’t far for all those benefits, and living near Brady & Harrison would make it easy to get around via car.

"Eh, overall if you've seen ""trouble areas"" before in towns big or small, you already know what and where to avoid by looking at it.  Crime can be anywhere by anyone, but QC is pretty safe from what I've experienced.  Worked for Dish for about 4 years out here and I've seen a lot of the good and the bad.

Otherwise, best pizza (to a Midwesterner from near Rockford) goes to both Poor Boys in Rock Island, or Sports Fans in Bettendorf.  Can't stand QC-style pizza.  It's weird.

Steel Plow in Moline has some good burgers, wouldn't say they're the best, but if you're celebrating something and want a memorable experience; order one of their shakes.  Insane.

Whitey's hands down has the best ice cream.  No competition. 

Soi 3 in Davenport is our go-to ramen place when we're feeling like some delicious pain (some of it is very spicy)

LeClaire has a Mississippi River Distilling Company which is absolute fire during summer.  Great seats with a river view and some of the best mixed drinks I've had.

Front Street Brewery in downtown Davenport is great, haven't tried the food (if they have any, I dunno).

I'm in a union shop and the former annoys me, and they generally have to deal with the cold shoulder after a labor dispute has been concluded, but I don't hate them. 

The later on the other hand can fuck right off, these guys give lawyers a good name. They generally are hired by specialized freelance companies who provide services to companies in the Middle of a strike, in some cases they are brought in to break up unions, then laid off later from the company. They are often times payed 2-3x what the original workers were in the short term and are usually not skilled in the trade.

"I love a lot of the food in the QC, but here's some, say, unusual things I like that people seem to get mad at every once in a while. I think if I have to die on a hill it better be a controversial choice, nobody is going to kill me over liking Lunardi's.

1. Chicken Enchilada at Rudy's - I used to work there in high school so there's a nostalgia aspect, and also it's drenched in cheese and huge. I know Rudy's is not good Mexican food but I think people miss the boat with this observation. There are plenty of places to get good Mexican, so I think Rudy (or whoever started it) decided to go completely in the opposite direction of authentic. Rudy's is so Americanized that it's now something completely different. I always think of it like the restaurant version of what my one aunt brings to a family reunion, and that's fine by me.
2. Whitey's Cherry Bon Bon Sundae is the most unique thing on their menu and is criminally underrated. They have lots of good stuff but I always tease my wife when she gets something like a Cookie Dough Shake because that kind of thing is the one way to make Whitey's taste like everywhere else. 
3. Uncle Bill's, to my taste buds, is distinct from and better than Wise Guys. It's a close race but I give it to Uncle Bill's. Yes, it's possible my brain is making me think there's a difference. Also, this opinion changes all the time so I don't know if I'd die for it.
4. I would eat at Trattoria Tiramisu over Lunardi's, it's much more interesting. At least for pasta.",t2_b1d9n,GrapheneHymen,0,1647959325.0,0,t1_i1nxzks,i1nxzks,True,P4rD0nM3,t3_tjp04n,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/tjp04n/food_that_youre_willing_to_die_on_a_hill_in_the/,Food That You're Willing To Die On A Hill In The Quad Cities,/r/QuadCities/comments/tjp04n/food_that_youre_willing_to_die_on_a_hill_in_the/i1nxzks/,3,r/QuadCities,0,3

"You would look at Google for something like ""tif report LeClair Iowa"". You do that and see that in 2018 the state of Iowa compiled a list of the tif for all localities in the state.

You then further refine your search and start looking for an updated version of that report, hopefully for 2022, but 2021 is probably more available.

While looking at that, you may notice that the DOM branch of Iowa.gov also has interesting keywords relating to TIF for a 2023 fiscal year, and then might want to start branching into those areas.


Along the way, you very well may find out that specific Iowa employees are doing specific things to tif reporting - like doing the compiling of the eastern Iowa data.

Loosen lug nuts, Jack car up, place car on jack stand, take off lug nuts, remove tire, most likely 2 bolts holding the calipers in, take those off but keep caliper in place, remove brake fluid line, remove caliper, use C clamp to make sure new caliper is all the way in, place on rotor, install new brake pads using the old caliper as a guide, install the 2 bolts, install the brake line, bleed the brakes, tire on, lug nuts on, lower car, tighten lugnuts.

Calipers are very simple, since they need to come off anyway when replacing the brakes. Most of the time, they only have a single brake fluid line attached to them.

"You're correct about the pricing by the book. That's what goes on at dealerships. Those book prices are based off what an engineer at the manufacturer says the length of time is required to accomplish whatever task at hand. 

Some independent shops use those book prices and charge like you talked about. If the book says 2 hours they'll charge for 2 hours if it only takes the mechanic 15 minutes. 

Some don't. Lots of independent wrenches charge for the time they got into whatever the job may be. They might quote you for that job from the price book though, it's always better to overestimate the cost of something and have the final bill come in lower than the quote.

Either way shop labor ain't cheap. At the very low end you're looking at $80⁰⁰/labor +parts +fluids +disposal fees. Body work cost significantly more. I also wouldn't recommend using aftermarket body parts because they usually don't fit right.

Also the markup on parts is dependent upon the shop when you go to an independent place as well.

I work on most of my own stuff. However, I refuse to mess with U-joints and drum brakes. The guys I take certain jobs like that to have no problem with me bringing in my own parts either.

"Moving out of Kimberly Club today, actually! Lol. I lived here about 3 years, and it was alright! I have a 2 bed, 1 bath, and the rent is about $845, but I was on a 6-month lease, so it was $50 more a month. Bedroom sizes are decent and the closests are a good size, kitchen is pretty small and not much room for storage. Also, no pantry, and that killed me, haha. Parking is not super great, but if only the people with parking passes park in your lot, it's not bad at all. 

You can get a garage for something like $60/month, but they're in need of a little restoring at some places. 

There are typically 2 washers and 2 dryers in each building, and each building usually has 12 apartments in it, so laundry can get busy at times. $2.00 / wash,  $0.25 / 10 mins dry time. A little expensive, in my opinion, as they just raised it from $1.00. It's one of the reasons why I'm leaving. 

They pay for heat, so living here in the winter is great! They are also pretty good about taking care of the sidewalks and parking lot with ice and snow. 

Mail is in the lowest level of the building, which is nice. But the main door to the building is locked, and FedEx rarely leaves packages anymore. Only the USPS delivery people have a key to the building. 

In the winter, my utility bills are usually less than $30. In the summer, my AC runs a lot (I've got leaky windows, too), and it's not uncommon for me to have a $80-90 electric bill. (I like the apartment at 67 at night). 

Mediacom is your only choice for internet and it's hit or miss.  

The majority of my issues were the neighbors. We have at least 1 apartment that constantly smokes weed and it just stinks up the whole building. It's a non-smoking campus in general, but when we would call to complain about the smell, nothing was ever done about it. The neighbors can make your life miserable anywhere though, so you may be totally fine. 

Noise between apartments usually isn't bad, but if there are screaming children, you're likely to hear them. 

I love how close to I-74 it is. It makes getting around town a lot faster than other places I've lived. HyVee Fast and Fresh at the intersection is a major blessing! The full HyVee is really close by too and hardly takes any time to get to it if there's no traffic on Kimberly. It's maybe 8 mins from Walmart too so it's a really nice area for getting places quickly. 

That was a lot and I'm very opinionated, but please feel free to DM me with any other questions.",t2_7tkek1l,Emmanemanem,0,1647608065.0,0,t1_i15b3ex,i15b3ex,True,Minespidurr,t3_tgypp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/tgypp9/looking_for_an_apartment_in_davenport/,Looking for an apartment in Davenport,/r/QuadCities/comments/tgypp9/looking_for_an_apartment_in_davenport/i15b3ex/,11,r/QuadCities,0,11

"I've lived at all 3 places. My favorite was winding hills. Nice area and generally quiet. The apartments are pretty nice with nice big master bedrooms.

Indian ridge had paper thin walls and we were always freezing in the winter no matter what.

Kimberly club wasn't bad, I don't have anything bad to say, other than when I lived there mys stereo got stolen out of my car, but that could probably happen anywhere. It wasn't bad, I just like the actual apartment at winding hill.

"Since ""good"" is subjective, besides ordering online from Saratoga Wine Exchange (I'm in IL and wine can be shipped here; not sure about Iowa), I've found Costco is actually the best place for wine I like. I'm an Italian red wine snob, for what it's worth, and they have DOC/G over there often, and their Kirkland brand of wine? Usually pretty good; not always, but I really like their Prosecco, Malbec for when I'm wanting something spicy, and their Pinot Grigio is pretty tasty. Again, all subjective, but I've found local wineries in the US, outside of California and Oregon, tend to use more sugar, and that's not my jam, no pun intended. :D",t2_a1j9hizr,thetimeofvalen,0,1647523501.0,0,t1_i10kiev,i10kiev,True,ProofDust1127,t3_tfzg6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuadCities/comments/tfzg6c/wine/,Wine,/r/QuadCities/comments/tfzg6c/wine/i10kiev/,4,r/QuadCities,0,4

"Because if the fit is garbage, you are going to bitch.

It’s bad enough insurance companies are putting aftermarket replacement bumpers on damn near everything. So they buy the bumper, paint it, install it, And when it doesn’t fit right, then they take pictures, send back to insurance company, to approve an actual OEM bumper, re-mix paint, paint the new bumper, and install it.

And sometimes it still doesn’t fit worth a shit, but you’re stuck with it.

If you would be open and upfront about not trying to hold them liable or drag them through the mud when your bumper doesn’t fit worth a shit, they’d likely be a lot more willing to help. Other option is they might paint it for you, and then let you take it home to put on yourself.

If we aren’t talking a bumper or fender that just bolts/clips on though, it’s a whole new ballgame.

"This is actually a really underappreciated way to meet good hearted people. Sure you get some who have to be there because of court, obligation to programs, schools and what not; but generally when you see people just help to help, they are that way in multiple ways of their lives. 

I always hate doing volunteer work but when I'm done I feel good and want to do more. It's always the issue of my time versus theirs and that's where I have to place my family value over others unfortunately. 

Now we have as a family done it. And it was fun. But as individuals, it definitely drags sometimes. 

To piggyback off you a bit more, the other huge thing is most of this type of work is low risk stuff, so you usually can talk. Great way to make friends, get to know people, and make yourself know.  

I will say, doing it for the churches feels good, but personally led me to a ton of future obligations I didn't want tied down to, and sometimes I would, sometimes I wouldn't. But everytime I wouldn't, they'd use my personality against me, guilt trip me, just always made me feel bad for saying no. But that's not all churches. 

I'm not religious either. So sometimes it makes awkward conversation to some folks. 

But, food banks are a great place. So is homeless shelters, most however don't use volunteers or when they do it's a small amount. 

Another place, and please, these people need it. Nursing homes. So many lonely old folks who want friends, and all their friends have forgotten them, moved on, visit sometimes or passed. There's a few around here where the people love young kids and adults coming. 

Ridgecrest I have sang for them during Christmas. We went to CASI for a game day, helped them play Wii Bowling. 
They love that stuff. We all should. But, I can honestly say, as I've grown, I've forgotten. And I can see why Nursing homes are kind of a dark place to be, you just have people watching you. Some care. But that feeling of being alone, being around others who you know will one day wake up dead... It's morbid. So, some young life coming in can make a huge impact on someone older. Everyone wants the best for the future, so bringing them yourself is showing them there is still caring in the future. 

My folks are getting up there in age. I don't want to see them being lonely or feel like my wife and I don't love them, so I'd hope if a situation like this was to ever happen, I could take care of them, or I could surround them with joy and love from others who could be there at times I can't. 

The older I get, and my parents, the more I see how fragile our lives really are, and what I've taken for granted. It's never too late to make the changes you want to see.
