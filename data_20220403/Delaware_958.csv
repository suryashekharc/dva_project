"Lived in Delaware for 10 years now. Kids and I can usually find something to do. They love Veterans park by the Y. It has a splash pad in the summer. Dairy Depot for ice cream, a couple other parks with soccer  and baseball fields, fishing, skateboarding, the pool. First Friday is a different themed festival every month. Farmers Market, Arts and Crafts Festival every May. There’s walking trails, and the zoo and zoombezi bay aren’t far. Schools are great too. Both my kids are in speech therapy and one in occupational therapy. The schools work with the Delaware speech and hearing center to provide both there at the school. So I don’t have to make special trips to get them to their sessions. My favorite part is the neighborhood is safe enough that I feel comfortable letting the kids ride their bikes (with friends) to any of these places. I’d never let them do that in Columbus.",t2_4h3dib2j,AsiaRedgrave,0,1648905703.0,0,t1_i33squp,i33squp,True,benditlikeslenderman,t3_tu4amm,https://www.reddit.com/r/DelawareOH/comments/tu4amm/pros_and_cons_of_living_in_delaware_v_cbus_area/,Pros and cons of living in Delaware v C-bus area,/r/DelawareOH/comments/tu4amm/pros_and_cons_of_living_in_delaware_v_cbus_area/i33squp/,3,r/DelawareOH,0,3
"I’ve lived in Delaware County for 25 years. We are just South of the city. I’ve read the other replies, and a lot of that info is pretty ridiculous. There’s a ton of stuff to do here. 15-20 minutes to the zoo. 10-15 to two large state parks/lakes. We have any food option you could want within 5-10 minutes. Very little crime, and a very desirable place to be. Schools range from good to great. One of the idiots replied that we are Trump country?! LOL. Imagine labeling an entire town based on your political ideology! What an idiot. Delaware, the city and county, has a lot to offer. Yes, we are North of Columbus, and it’ll take a bit of time to travel to the Columbus. But you can typically be anywhere in the greater Columbus area in less than 40 minutes. We offer small-town-America feel, with modern amenities.

"Between wife and mom, I have taken them to many specialists. They tend to be around hospitals. Dublin Methodist, St Anns in Westerville,  Riverside hospital. Delaware has a small hospital (Grady) with a few medical buildings close.  You can get lab work, xrays, orthopedic rehab real close. 

Delaware has access to several different highways, depending on which side of Columbus you need to go to. I've been doing it for 6 years now. No big deal. Maybe once or twice a year, there will be a wreck that holds you up. 30 to 45 mins is a normal drive to a north Columbus area doctor. When I take my wife to an appt, we usually stop in the Polaris area on the way home , to grab a nice dinner.

"It was frustrating because we lived on the west side of delaware within walking distance of downtown but for the cheapest groceries the best combo is to go to the east side of 23 to Aldi and Meijer, but the only way to get there is to go through a 2 lane (now 2 lanes with a turning lane) stretch of road through downtown that all converges with 23, 37, and 42 so it could take you 15 minutes to go 3 miles due to all of the traffic. This will only ever get worse as the population grows because the only way to fix it is to demolish some buildings and make it 4 lanes which the city will never do. If you want to go to columbus itself you're looking at a 45-60 minute drive depending on where you want to go. Delaware is obviously cheaper to live but it comes at the cost of location.

"I moved out of Columbus 6 years ago to Delaware after I retired. Really like the small town flavor. They close off the downtown for festivals in warm weather. Crime rate is out of control in Columbus, had to get out. If you are looking for peace and quiet, Delaware is the place.

Highbanks park is very nice. It is roughly 2 miles south of Shale Hollow. It has trails along the Olentangy river with lots of trails thru the woods. Also, Polaris mall area has all the shopping and stores you could want. It's about 2 miles east of Highbanks. Alum Creek state park is a short drive north of Delaware. Alot of boating and a fair beach.

I don't mind the drive, but I only have to go to the northern end of Columbus 2 days a week. Found some back roads that avoid most of the traffic.

"I lived in Delaware for about 5 years and moved to Westerville 2 years ago and I like it better for a variety of reasons. You’ll have good access to the zoo via 42 and riverside drive, but thats about it. Everything else will take at least 30 minutes to get to and thats without traffic. You have highbanks in lewis center which is a great park for hiking with kids. There’s also some good parks north of Delaware and some good apple picking farms in marion but Delaware itself has little in way of entertainment besides the outlet. The food options are hit and miss too for downtown. 1st friday is a good source of entertainment especially if you live close enough to walk. The worst thing about Delaware is how it acts as a choke point for traffic on 36, 37, and 42.

"This was difficult to listen to. Not because of any racism. Because this person has no business speaking into a microphone. This 20 minute rambling could have easily been reduced to 5 minutes of clarity. But, no. 

And I disagree with the entire premise of this complaint. The owner didn’t call the offended a N-word. He said rap songs use the term too often, and his patrons didn’t want to hear that word. He may not have expressed his belief with the most succinct words, but he wasn’t calling this guy any names at all. 

This may hurt my overall stance, but Delaware is a smaller, more old fashioned town. Rap isn’t exactly a staple of the music scene. You may think that’s racist. Whatever. I’m sure if I go to Harlem, I won’t find too many juke boxes/music apps with The Doobie Brothers or Metallica.

"EMS is a different issue than fire so a lot of your assertions about the EMS aren't completely correct. The entire County relies on DCEMS for its EMS coverage except Liberty Township and the City of Delaware who receive funding from DCEMS to provide EMS services. Think of DCEMS as the basic level of EMS coverage. Liberty and the City feel they need a higher level of EMS service so they take funding from DCEMS and then add additional funds to provide the level of service that they wish to have. But DCEMS will still roll an ambulance into those areas if needed. The only political boundary that DCEMS recognizes is the county line. 

When it comes to fire protection though, there is not a base level of protection. Each Township/City is on their own and it is the wild wild west. Some townships partnered with cities like BST&G for example which provides fire protection for Berkshire & Trenton townships along with the City of Sunbury and the Village of Galena. Cities can partner with townships if they wanted to but they give up a level of control. BST&G Fire Department (the way I understand it) has a four member board, with each township/city/village getting a representative, and that board makes the decisions for the entire zone. Sunbury who has the most dense population still only gets one vote at the table and this right here is why Delaware City won't partner with Tri-Township or the County. They want control and if it means wasting taxpayer money in the process, they are still going to do it. 

Personally I feel that the County should take on the same model for fire protection that they do with the EMS where they provide the base level of service and if specific townships/cities want a higher level, they can pay more for it. The way fire protection is done currently throughout the county is inefficient and more costly.",t2_6z087fjo,Lupis_Domesticus,0,1639944214.0,0,t1_hp7gc76,hp7gc76,False,rprz,t3_rhxhd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/,5th fire station in works,/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/hp7gc76/,2,r/DelawareOH,0,2
"Unfortunately the best solution, one combined station for all three agencies isn't likely. DCEMS is only in Berlin's Station, Tri's new station and has a Station on Radnor Twp's property because they rely on DCEMS for their EMS coverage, and of course they are willing to work with the agency that does their medic runs.

Otherwise you'll be hard pressed to get any department that does their own EMS to cooperate for a number of reasons like EMS Billing disputes, issues within the station between both agencies personel, and space issues.

DCEMS got kicked out of Genoa's station largely because of the EMS billing dispute, and Liberty Township rallied against DCEMS coming into their stations, though that was mainly due to the issue of them replacing Liberty's Medics.

As with most things politics will prevent the most efficient option.

All in all the city needed more space for Admin/Prevention and this fit the bill along with improving coverage / response times, not a total waste.",t2_9c6e7,N71FS,0,1639938119.0,0,t1_hp71do9,hp71do9,False,rprz,t3_rhxhd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/,5th fire station in works,/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/hp71do9/,1,r/DelawareOH,0,1
"And I don't argue with the need for better response times for fire and EMS. But what Chief Donahue doesn't discuss is the brand new fire and EMS station being built by Tri-Township and the County literally 1/2 mile away on Bowtown Road from the proposed location of this City fire house. Because of the road improvement project that will happen at the point where William and Central Ave come together, the existing Tri-Township fire house is being demolished. The County partnered with Tri-Township to have a shared space for fire and EMS, similar to what they have in Radnor Township. I am sure the City could have partnered with them also and built a better fire house and EMS startion that would have served both City and County residents in that area. The reason this isn't happening is because the City and the County can't agree on anything, let alone the City working with Tri-Township. The fact that they are wasting tax payer money by building two separate facilities doesn't seem to bother them at all.",t2_6z087fjo,Lupis_Domesticus,0,1639799010.0,0,t1_hp0bfwd,hp0bfwd,False,rprz,t3_rhxhd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/,5th fire station in works,/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/hp0bfwd/,1,r/DelawareOH,0,1
"Its not all about the size of the area when it comes to fire departments, the biggest thing is response time.

>Donahue stated in a summary of the proposal that responses to the area of the Kroger distribution facility have met the desired six-minute response time 16.67% of the time for emergency responses, with the 90th percentile being 10:01 minutes this year

&#x200B;

10 Minutes for a response in a suburban area is not good, Fire Departments in the US use [NFPA 1710](https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=1710) as a guideline for response times. Per NFPA your first arriving engine to a fire shouldn't take longer than 4 minutes to arrive on scene. 

With all of the Plastic and Composite materials in new houses and apartments nowadays fire's grow quicker than ever. A fire in one room can go from a small flame to a unsurvivable environment quickly.  [You have about 3 minutes to be alerted and get out of a house fire.](https://ul.org/new-demonstration-video-shows-you-only-have-three-minutes-escape-home-fire)

And that's not even getting into the EMS side of things, in the case of a cardiac arrest most people won't be able to provide 10 minutes of high quality chest compressions until Medics get on scene.

Quicker response can also lower your home insurance cost, Insurers use [ISO Ratings](https://www.isomitigation.com/ppc/fsrs/) to determine how much you pay. The better the ISO rating your department has, the cheaper the insurance.

That being said, I'm not a resident, and I don't know what the cities financial situation is like. From the outside the city seems to be doing ok, and Fire/EMS would be among the top things I would want them putting money into if I was a resident.",t2_9c6e7,N71FS,0,1639771765.0,0,t1_hoymiqp,hoymiqp,False,rprz,t3_rhxhd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/,5th fire station in works,/r/DelawareOH/comments/rhxhd6/5th_fire_station_in_works/hoymiqp/,3,r/DelawareOH,0,3

"I did not say it was a tax increase... it is not, but if you are looking to live in Delaware it is an added expense and barrier to entry... just like I stated above. Yeah you get it back when/if you move out, but that doesn't help when looking to move in. 

He mentioned being overwhelmed a couple of times but I'll see if I can find the audio for you and he missed one of the first meetings after being appointed and had the Mayor fill in for him and she mentioned that he seemed overwhelmed and couldn't make it to the meeting... I know of that one because I was there.

Yes council does not directly raise taxes, but Mr. Tackett has made that a big part of his campaign even though it's not something he can control. In fact in a recent interview with WDLR he was blindsided by a property tax issue that he apparently didn't even know about.

How is raising a deposit that you get back a tax increase?

And how does saying IF there is to be some sort of situation where we absolutely have to raise taxes that there should be a sunset clause included in the language to allow residents the right to continue renewing a tax increase a bad thing?

Staas - Brewery only, but some good drinks  
Barley Hopsters - fun place to try out beers. You can grab a single bottle and pay for it, and drink it up there. Have some homebrewing stuff too, but found it limited in that regard.  
Couple of Antique stores if you're into that.   
Honey and Abernathy   
Opa is excellent Greek. Owner is always there and is fantastic. Huge Bourbon selection as well.   
The Greater Gouda - Excellent meat & cheese shop. They also have a really good selection of hot spices / sauces. Picked up a bottle of bourbon aged maple syrup and it was AMAZING!  
Rebel Toys - all kinds of vintage / new stuff there. Definitely worth a look if your into that.   
Ciao - for Coffee and some of the most delicious canolies ever.   
Parking is a hot mess mess. Free after hours, meters during the day. There is an app to pay if you don't have change.

"Since the news referred to to the decedent as a Columbus resident and listed his age, I did a criminal records search and found a guy matching his age and description with 7 criminal cases ranging from Domestic Violence in 2003 to a charge of Assault and Domestic Violence 5/5/2021 with some Aggravated Menacing and Criminal Trespass thrown in for good measure in between.

If I were the Detective on the case I'd take a look at parties involved in those cases (especially the most recent one) and see if any of them had any commentary on his disappearance.

I'd assume that after 18 years of domestic abuse, one ends up with enemies that are less lenient than the Franklin County Court System.

"I gotcha fam:

Just one Ohio county is closing in on 60% of its population getting vaccinated for COVID-19, and the widespread immunizations are showing what living with the virus might be like after the pandemic ends.

More than 120,000 of Delaware County's roughly 209,000 residents have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, state data show. As vaccinations increased steadily in the county, cases declined dramatically.

Cases in Delaware County peaked on Jan. 4 with 241, while just eight cases were reported in the county Tuesday, the most-recent day for which data was available. Delaware County hasn't reported a COVID-19 death since April 21, state data show.

Shelia Hiddleson, Delaware Public Health District commissioner, was happy to see the vaccine so widely accepted in the county and hopes that cases continue to stay low as a result.

""The number is fluctuating a little bit, but our cases are down,"" Hiddleson said. ""We are pretty thrilled with the uptake in vaccination. … We're pretty high up there.""

Although Delaware County is still at times reporting a handful of new cases, it may be on the verge of none if vaccinations continue to increase in the county, said Dr. Joe Gastaldo, medical director of infectious diseases for OhioHealth.

Across the country, some counties are reporting few to no new cases and hospitalizations, Gastaldo said. San Francisco General Hospital in California, for instance, was reportedly caring for zero virus patients May 20 and the Bay Area as a whole has seen cases decline dramatically. 

""Good for Delaware County. They could easily get there,"" Gastaldo said. ""Delaware County could become San Francisco County. They’re on that trajectory.""

The waning pandemic appears to be putting many Delaware County residents at ease after more than a year of staying home and keeping their distance, Hiddleson said. Hiddleson has noticed more people shopping and dining at restaurant throughout the county though statewide health restrictions won't be fully lifted until Wednesday.

Delaware County is already near the threshold of 50 cases per every 100,000 residents that Gov. Mike DeWine initially set for COVID-19 restrictions to be lifted across Ohio. As of Wednesday, Delaware County had a two-week average of 53 new cases per 100,000 residents, according to the state.

The fact that infections decreased as vaccinations rose in Delaware County is a ""great sign"" and exactly what doctors hoped to see, said Dr. Mark Herbert, an infectious disease specialist for Mount Carmel Health. Though declining cases may give people more peace of mind, Herbert said they need to be careful and abide by virus safety measures.

""We know the areas where immunization rates are high and disease rates are lower. … But I think that we still need to be cautious,"" Herbert said.

In recent weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has relaxed its guidelines for vaccinated Americans. Those who have been immunized no longer need to wear a mask or socially distance in most situations while those who have yet to get a jab are asked to continue wearing face coverings, according to the CDC.

Although places like Delaware County offer a glimmer of hope, it's important that Ohioans don't get ahead of themselves, Gastaldo said.

To fully squash the pandemic, Gastaldo said, it will take several more months of vaccinations and pinpointed efforts to get people vaccinated who either don't have easy access to a shot or are skeptical of it.

Scientists and doctors have predicted that between 70% and 90% of people need to be vaccinated for COVID-19 in order to substantially slow or altogether halt transmission of the virus.

As of Wednesday, 44.74%, or more than 5.2 million Ohioans, had received at least the first dose of a vaccine. Nationally, more than 165 million, or 50% of all Americans, have gotten at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the CDC.

Until the state nears that threshold, people need to remain vigilant and do what's best for them and their family members who may or may not be fully vaccinated, Gastaldo said.

""This is not the end,"" Gastaldo said. ""This is the end of the worst of the pandemic for us. But it’s not the end of the pandemic.""",t2_mphda,0110010001100010,0,1622552494.0,0,t1_h06sv13,h06sv13,False,rprz,t3_nptb30,https://www.reddit.com/r/DelawareOH/comments/nptb30/in_delaware_county_high_vaccination_rate_offers_a/,"In Delaware County, high vaccination rate offers a glimpse at post-pandemic life",/r/DelawareOH/comments/nptb30/in_delaware_county_high_vaccination_rate_offers_a/h06sv13/,17,r/DelawareOH,2,17

"Ethanol is bad about absorbing moisture out of the air.   Eventually it gets saturated with the moisture and becomes heavier than the gas its mixed in.  This mixture of moisture and ethanol then falls to the bottom of the tank and its called phase separation.   Its normally not an issue in our cars because we use the gas up pretty quickly.  However for boats that are stored on the water, it can be an issue because their gas tanks are vented to the air and the air being directly above the water can be rather moist.  Because of this, Marinas usually have ethanol free gas, one reason gas cost more at the Marina.   

For similar reasons, its not a bad idea to use in yard equipment, especially if it is near the end of the season where you may store the equipment until summer.  

Also ethanol is hard on some rubber.  So if you have older equipment and older vehicles, it may not be a bad idea to use ethanol free.   Rubber lines and diaphragms in older vehicle gas pumps deteriorate because of the ethanol.   Today's vehicles and equipment is made to handle the ethanol and it's not an issue.",t2_9ea8dyan,1d10cracy2021,0,1619141855.0,0,t1_gvimv80,gvimv80,False,Tato-head,t3_mtpsq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DelawareOH/comments/mtpsq2/stopped_at_the_delaware_sheetz_for_the_first_time/,Stopped at the Delaware Sheetz for the first time today.

"I have only gone through the up front evaluation process with one of the trainers for a little over an hour. My vet recommended them specifically for aggression as we have a fearful 70 pound dog with several variables we need to systematically remove. They are not inexpensive but I look at it as knowledge for me forever that I can easily apply to all of my future dogs. The more aggressive cases or the more behavioral they actually board with the trainer. We are going to end up doing a mix of that. It’s very professional and in my case the trainer has a similar calm demeanor to my own so the vibe for me and the comfort was absolutely ideal. 

The training goes for ten sessions. I believe it’s universal with all their trainers but you can also do group sessions post training for free for the rest of your dogs life twice a month. It’s an investment in your dog and your canine future and in my case I have a soon to be 7 year old so this level of training is required for me. It’s 2500 dollars not including equipment and the e-collar, leather lead and other training collar are all warrantied. I’m happy to answer other questions but the level of training once complete is pretty remarkable and with a dog that has aggressive tendencies it’s again what I feel is required to move on with a happy and healthy dog and a happy and healthy family.

As far as I know they have trainers all over the country but it doesn’t feel corporate or unworthy of the money. I almost immediately felt better about my situation. If you want to dm me you can and I can give you even more specifics on a more personal level. I’m in Delaware, Ohio. Edit: you also don’t have to pay it all up front and while we are doing a-okay with the pandemic etc it’s still taken it’s toll on us financially as we own a business in food.

"I wanted to address this information, why it works and some misinformation in your post. Pardon me  if I come off snide. Directness is my forte. Dogs understand body language they thrive on boundaries, repetition and structure. The dog doesn’t think you’re his pack leader. He respects you because you provide him boundaries. Alpha theory was actually disproven by the individual who created it. The best way for your dog to respect you is to communicate with them the way they understand which you did body blocking asking for calming behaviors in your case to sit and wait developed a set of behaviors. This is considered positive reinforcement. Which is reinforcing the dog for doing the asked behavior BF Skinner developed [Operant Conditioning ](https://practicalpie.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Operant-Conditioning-1024x776.png) that contains 4 different quadrants of learning. Operant conditioning isn’t only used in dog training it’s used for all learning for humans as well. Like I said before what you taught your dog is you get the food when you perform a certain behavior.

"Hi there! Names Jess I own Jess trains dogs. My recommendation is to hand feed your GR the way you fix resource guarding is to take away whatever they’re guarding. My usual method to remedy this is to hand feed your dog/ use your dog food as training this one strengthens your bond with your dog and takes the guarding out of the situation. The dogs I’ve trained with resource guarding really benefit from this method. Feel free to ask me any questions and I’d be happy to answer.

"Even after you find a good trainer, there are steps you can do at home to help her. The best thing you can  do for her is make sure she knows you are the alpha. How I did this with my dog when we brought him home was I made him wait until I let him eat his food. I stood in the way and made sure he knew that was MY food that he was getting. Ever since those first few weeks making him know who's the top dog, he ceased being aggressive around food. I don't claim to be a dog trainer and that is just what worked for me but maybe give it a try. I have my 4 and 6 year olds feed him now and they even make sure that he sits and waits until they tell him to eat. You may not have wanted to read all this from a stranger.
