"It was more than a speakeasy, this is from rutherfordtnhistory.org:

Rainbow Cave (aka Black Cat Cave)

The John Thomas Sullivan farm straddled the Lebanon Pike just a bit north of the old Compton Road crossing.  The family home, where at least three generations had lived by the 1930s, was on the east side of the Pike. In front of the house, near the roadway, was a long bluff of exposed limestone.  Beneath the rock overhang, facing the highway, was a cave entrance.

“It was the Rainbow Cave,” remembers Marian Sullivan Webb, granddaughter of the farm owner.  “Someone had painted a rainbow on the bluff face.” Whether the name predated the painting or was prompted by the art is unclear.  In the 1920s, according to local lore, Sullivan walled in the mouth of the cave like a storefront with three doors and eight to ten windows.  The front interior of the cave was divided into three rooms.

Webb remembers that inside the cave there was a dance floor, a “big” fireplace, a small dining room and a kitchen.  The Sullivan children were not permitted in the cave, and Webb remembers stories of the cave at some earlier time being a place for “drinking, gambling and risqué women.”

In the 1930s, after the repeal of Prohibition, Sullivan leased the cave to Mrs. Pauline Lannom Neely.  “She put hardwood on the dance floor and covered the walls with cedar planks.  On Saturday nights they held square dances in the cave,” recalls Webb.

In 1937, the Sullivans sold 18 acres on the east side of the Pike to the VA, and moved to their remaining property across the highway.  Soon after the VA opened the new hospital, the highway was rerouted to the east of the cave, and Neely moved her business to an above-ground location closer to Murfreesboro.  “I don’t recall anyone else running a business in the cave after Mrs. Neely left,” says Webb.

On the west side of the cave there was a spring “near where we threshed corn under a big hackberry tree.  The spring flowed into a sink that ran into the cave,” recalls Webb.  “There was also a cave entrance on the VA side near the river.”

In 1971, the VA transferred the cave property to the city of Murfreesboro with the stipulation that the property be maintained and operated as a “public park and public recreation area.”  This use was to be “perpetual.” (See Rutherford Co. Deed Book No. 205, page 550.)  Today the entrance to Rainbow Cave, more commonly known as the Black Cat Cave, is partially filled and concealed by undergrowth. (“Black Cat” is believed to have been the name of the tavern or nightclub that operated in the 1920s.  Unfortunately, there is no reliable documentation of such cave activity during Prohibition.)

It is curious that this storied cave is not listed in either of the two Tennessee Division of Geology publications on Tennessee caves: “Caves of Tennessee” by Thomas Barr (1961) and “Descriptions of Tennessee Caves” by Larry Matthews (1971)",t2_jyl836zc,Radio-Virgo,0,1648829270.0,0,t1_i2zyjyx,i2zyjyx,False,Total_Stuff3420,t3_ttqr2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/ttqr2h/whats_your_most_favorite_murfreesboro_area_factoid/,What's your most favorite Murfreesboro area factoid?,/r/murfreesboro/comments/ttqr2h/whats_your_most_favorite_murfreesboro_area_factoid/i2zyjyx/,10,r/murfreesboro,0,10

"This man grocery shops. 

I see your wife likes the Publix sushi, but has she tried Sprouts sushi? Publix is definitely top tier supermarket sushi, not knocking it. Sprouts sushi is on a whole other level tho. The rice is so fresh. Really stands out among the other supermarket sushi rice. Even the ginger and wasabi tastes much, much fresher than the competition. 

That's just my two cents. I see that you guys shop at Sprouts already and maybe she has already tried it and wasn't a fan. I will say that the sushi at Sprouts has a slightly higher price tag. But we aren't shopping at Sprouts to pinch pennies.


Side note - I also shop at Tagz. Both old and new location. I will be honest with you. I'm not a fan of the new location. It actually feels like there is *less* produce/product to buy. It also lost its ""family"" feel to it. At least for me it did.  The ceiling is way too high and the actual walking area is too small. Parking lot can be a nightmare as well.

"Ok... so I'm all about an attempted solution to the traffic issues, but concerned about the actual use of it. The volume alone is a major factor, but the drivers come a close second to the reasons for delay; a constant stream of wrecks all along the interstate every day it seems is as much a cause as the number on the road. 

This weekend there were closures of the left lane on 24 both east and west bound near Smyrna exit- with left lane closed clearly marked for miles before, people chose to drive *all the way up* to the end of the lane, and then attempt to merge.

"My son likes the Kroger over on Lascassas Pike because it is close to home. We hit Walmart once or twice a month and Aldi once or twice a week. On some items Aldi is the best, with Costco prices in old couple quantities. I'm big on grass fed and untainted meat and I buy at both stores. UGO on Broad and Church has pork sausage that is just salt, spices and pig meat that I find to be flavorful. And if you are on a tight budget that store is worth checking out. Sprouts has some items you will not find elsewhere and while their prices are mostly high I have found some deals there. You did not say what you are looking for, low prices, best produce, HQ meat, or whatever. I am a member at both Sam's and Costco. Sam's has the best canned chicken and I like their hot dogs better than Costco. And it is nice having the gasoline savings. Off topic but Costco is the best for tires IMO. Plus they have free nitrogen for your tires. Finally, Publix has the best supermarket sushi according to my wife. And they have some items she prefers, I saw ""horseradish from Publix"" on the shopping list. They have wonderful produce, too. Today I'm going to check out Tag'z meat store on Memorial.

"Full disclosure: I am an adult male with a broad base of experiences from which to draw regarding personal safety.  I'm betting that the OP is not a person that is otherwise out to harm other people. That point is important because, in my opinion, the people that ARE out to hurt others do, in fact, deserve to feel a level of un-safety. All of that being said, I want the OP to know that she deserves to feel safe 24/7/365. Further, that 24/7/365 ideal is, perhaps, unattainable in the real world. We can, however, work on making ourselves (the only variable in life we can control) not only FEEL safer, but also BEHAVE in ways that make us measurably safer on a day-to-day basis. Simply moving to a new place that has features designed to add to our safety isn't, in the long term, going to make us safer. Consider the apartment complex that is well-lit, has gated access and perhaps a professional on-site security staff. All of those features are great so long as, when living there, you can still afford everything else you might need to be happy and healthy. I know of plenty of people that live in a veritable fortress that still don't feel safe because they have ignored their own intrinsic needs. Conversely, I know plenty of people that live in ""bad"" neighborhoods that are quite safe, happy and healthy living there because of HOW they live their lives. People need to find their own sense of balance.

People like you have no idea how capitalism works, and you’d rather just ramble of liberal talking points without even asking yourself hey how would this effect other people?

If you would do even just 2 seconds of googling you’d find out that TN has a tax surplus right now so they are trying to remove a few taxes like groceries, and gas to help the average family that lives here. Other than that there is nothing else the gov can do

"Hi guys,

We've gotten OVERWHELMING SUPPORT from the various Tennessee subreddits in working to try and defeat William Lamberth's HB-1927 that seeks to outlaw Delta-8 THC and other alternate cannabinoids in TN. 

If you haven't seen my original posts about contacting state representatives about this bill, please visit my profile and you'll see posts from me in the Memphis, Knoxville, Chattanooga, Nashville and Murfreesboro subs.

I spoke with the **Tennessee Growers Coalition** who are lobbying to defeat this bill that is getting voted on next **Wednesday, March 30.**

The Tennessee Growers Coalition in the process of hiring an ADDITIONAL lobbying team to directly defeat this bill. They told me that if we donate to the link above, it will go directly to defeat this bill.

I wanted to raise awareness about this in case you can help with a donation. We can donate and we can use my original posts mentioned above to contact those voting on this bill. This is how we can help!

Thank you Tennessee.",t2_hx7o5wwr,IknowIamBreathingIn,0,1648226886.0,0,t1_i232y9v,i232y9v,True,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tnqcea,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/tnqcea/new_way_you_can_help_defeat_upcoming_thc_delta8/,New Way You Can Help Defeat Upcoming THC Delta-8 THC Ban Bill,/r/murfreesboro/comments/tnqcea/new_way_you_can_help_defeat_upcoming_thc_delta8/i232y9v/,4,r/murfreesboro,0,4

"As I read it, I think it's a dumbfuck bill.  And the reason for me (Setting aside the obvious loss in revenue) is that the presumption is baffling.  The math that they're using is just:  


""If we assume...we can assume...""   


It's back of the napkin math, and something this financially significant deserves some further investigation - like a financial audit or something to verify if their presumptions are even REMOTELY accurate.    


As a user of D8 and HHC myself, I use it to regulate social anxiety, as well as to help with chronic back pain from years of morbid obesity before losing weight.  It has helped immensely with both - but I'm a responsible grown human adult...I'm not going to get high and drive, or operate machinery, or even do more than basic math.  Hell, I don't even make dinner decisions because I'll order one of everything!  


But I don't think it will ban the hemp-derived cannabinoids as much as it is just a stupid and punitive bill that would allow the incarceration of anyone caught selling or possessing non-compliant D8, D9, HHC, and any other future compounds or products that are not as commercially viable today.  So while I think it's stupid as a bill, and I'm not going to stop buying, irrespective of the law, I don't think it's the world ender that the lawmakers think it is.  They just see the space as a wild west of non-compliant products, but (for example) the guys at Hometown Hero who assay every batch and provide documentation - I don't worry much about legal compliance.    


To clarify though - I'm neither a lawyer, a chemist, or even very smart.

"“• This legislation will include certain hemp products within the definition of marijuana, effectively prohibiting the sale or possession of hemp products that have a THC concentration of more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis, regardless of whether such THC is derived of the delta-8 cannabinoids or otherwise.”

As I read it, this would simply make the rules in TN consistent with those in the Farm Bill which has the same 0.3% dry weight (mass) rules.

As far as vapes, flower, etc…it would seem to me that they have mass (grams) so they would just have to comply with the same 0.3% rules, which it seems to

"Did you read the specific Amendment linked below? I'm just curious to make sure we are reading the same thing because the link below makes it seem like nobody will be able to sell psychoactive D8 based on the .3 percent being established for all THCs. Therefore, only the gummies you mentioned above would be compliant, not vape, flower or any of the other products that require more than .3 percent D8 for it to be active by weight. Let me know your thoughts.

"So the Farm Bill 2018 says that the delineation of a hemp derived product versus marijuana (marihuana) is that hemp products may contain no more than 0.3% THC by mass (grams).

So…cool, that’s the rule, no problem:  just put more THC into even bigger edibles, it’s still compliant.

Let’s consider gummies for example:

If you want a 25mg Delta8 THC gummy, then you’d need to have (25mg/0.003) an 8.33g gummy by mass.  And that’s super easy to achieve.  Want to be safe?  Cool, make it a 15g gummy.  

Want to get semi-baked and do 100g of Delta8 THC, cool, make the edible bigger.

By anchoring the amount of THC permitted by a fixed value (mass), the Farm Bill basically incentivized sellers to just offer bigger edibles to accommodate ever bigger doses.  The Farm Bill doesn’t restrict how much (or what types) of THC, HHC, etc can be consumed…only how much non-psychoactive “stuff” has to go into the total mass of the product (99.97% of the total grams).

It SEEMS like this won’t actually prevent sellers who aren’t selling crap products or products with uncertain doses from selling in TN, it would just make it illegal to violate the Farm Bill standards, but under State law instead of Federal.",t2_c9mbv,tycowboy,0,1648168663.0,0,t1_i2069ou,i2069ou,False,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tn0ccc,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/,New TN Bill to Outlaw Delta-8 THC,/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/i2069ou/,3,r/murfreesboro,0,3

Hi Fellow Tennesseeans,

I'm posting this link to raise awareness about Representative William Lamberth's new amendment to Bill HB-1927 that will effectively outlaw Delta-8 THC and other legal cannabinoids derived from legal hemp. Please remember, this bill is attempting to criminalize Delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids that are legal under both State and Federal Law.

This bill will:

Decrease State Revenue – Net Impact - $4,840,900/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

Increase State Expenditures - $2,900 Incarceration

Decrease Local Revenue – Net Impact - $1,975,400/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

This is a very poorly thought out bill that will negatively impact sales revenue in the state, will increase incarceration and expenses thereof and will decrease local tax revenue. This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a FEDERALLY LEGAL compound.Please my fellow Tennesseans, do what you can to raise awareness about this and help stop this bill in it's tracks. 

Representative Chris Hurt is pushing through Bill HB-1690 that seeks to regulate Delta-8 THC and create sales tax revenue in the state. This is a better approach and I hope that the bill to regulate vs outlaw takes precedent this year.Both of these bills are going through the process now, so please do what you can to contact local reps, local businesses who legally sell Delta-8 THC and anybody who benefits from this legal medicine to try their best and fight back.Much love Tennessee.

Subject line: Decrease State Tax Revenue

Hi xxx,

I'm reaching out as a concerned Tennesseean to ask you to vote NO on Representative William Lamberth's new amendment to Bill HB-1927 that will effectively outlaw Delta-8 THC and other legal cannabinoids derived from legal hemp. Please remember, this bill is attempting to criminalize Delta-8 THC and other cannabinoids that are legal under both State and Federal Law.

This bill will:

Decrease State Revenue – Net Impact - $4,840,900/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

Increase State Expenditures - $2,900 Incarceration

Decrease Local Revenue – Net Impact - $1,975,400/FY22-23 and Subsequent Years

This bill will negatively impact sales revenue in the state which hurts the people you represent, will increase incarceration and expenses thereof and will decrease local tax revenue. This will hurt many local businesses and hemp farmers operating legally under state and federal law and will result in more Tennesseans getting incarcerated and becoming felons in possession of a Federally legal compound.

I ask you to please do the right thing and vote No on criminalizing a Federally legal compound that will result in reduced state tax revenue and increased incarceration and costs associated.

Thank you xx.",t2_hx7o5wwr,IknowIamBreathingIn,0,1648152077.0,0,t1_i1z2gzs,i1z2gzs,True,IknowIamBreathingIn,t3_tn0ccc,https://www.reddit.com/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/,New TN Bill to Outlaw Delta-8 THC,/r/murfreesboro/comments/tn0ccc/new_tn_bill_to_outlaw_delta8_thc/i1z2gzs/,13,r/murfreesboro,0,13

"2 things. 

First the burden of proof that the store was closed because a union was formed would be on the Plaintiff. Any retail store, particularly one in the food service sector, can demonstrate a loss anytime they want to. 

Second the NLRB is the agency that would be involved. As an administrative body they cannot infer or prosecute anything as a criminal act, so the phrase “illegal” doesn’t really attach. Also, the NLRB absolutely cannot take any action against any business that has closed.

Lastly in the recent decision overturning Specialty Healthcare, the NLRB issued a finding in PCC Structures (365 NLRB no. 160 (2017) that gives employers much more say in bargaining unit determinations. In fact, it places nearly all the weight on the employer.

I go to Costco. It’s 8 dollars but they offer under carriage wash and tire wax as standard. I don’t believe any of the 5-8 dollar basic washes in town do that. It’s great for when the roads are salted. That’s my go to once a month.  When I want a quality wash I go to Smith Brothers. Dont bother with the basic wash here. It’s reasonably priced. Expect to pay $25 plus tip for a decent wash. Your car will be hand dried and vacuumed by a squad of workers. Those are the only two spots I go to. All the monthly places are the same imo.

Also statics wise and lab wise if you start looking at total solar heat rejection. Llumar.  Has the slight advantage vs other films at the same percentage.

Then one year my father bought a couple of tons of chicken manure to fertilize the garden... holy geez, a giant pile of that stuff sitting under the sun...The whole family agreed he was *never* allowed to do that again. 

We had five small birds. Their droppings were scattered all over a sizeable back yard, not concentrated. We kept the coop clean and they were well cared for. I can honestly say there is no smell detectable by a neighbor. And I can honestly say that if we did build an enclosure for them, it would certainly have concentrated their droppings and caused a smell, not prevented it. The ordinance didn't apply here like that. There were not chicken droppings all over our or people's cars, property, etc. The dogs being walked up and down our streets leave piles of shit in our and our neighbors lawns.

"Someone down voted your comment. Since moving to Tennessee I have been carrying a handgun. The state I came from ""allowed"" you to apply for a pistol purchase permit after you got a firearms ID card after fingerprinting and extensive background checks. And several hundred dollars in fees. Then you had to keep said pistol in your home. No carry of any sort. So while waiting for her permit a woman was hacked to death in her own driveway by a former boyfriend who she had a restraining order against. That slip of paper did not protect her. A 9mm might have. But even if she had a gun, she could not have carried it legally. Here is a link.

"thank you!! I guess i should have specified - I fully plan on getting a job within the industry I’m getting my degree in once I graduate, the only issue is that not many folks are hiring in my industry for someone without a degree, even if I’ll have one in a few months. The obvious solution here is to ride out the rest of my time at my current place of work, but the situation there is so terrible that it has become emergent that I get out asap for the sake of my mental health. But I so appreciate your kind comment!!! I will absolutely keep that metality when I have my degree and am able to qualify for more industry jobs. 

*side note - I already have some side gigs with a few industry jobs (I’m in the music business realm so I’ve secured a few box office ticketing / merch positions), they just don’t schedule me often enough for me to make a full living with them. But, I’m doing those odd jobs as well so that once I graduate I know people in the industry and have set myself up for success with networking and such.

"Good evening my fellow Murfreesboro friends! It has been WAY too long since I’ve been able to do this & I apologize for that. I am a local business owner and this past year has not been my best financially. I have been fortunate enough to maintain doing these things in person, but I have not had the extra to offer online as I typically get quite a bit of help requests. I am looking for pay for anyones water bill who is past due. I choose this one because the average water bill is $50 - $120 and this will allow me to help quite a bit families if needed. I am going to leave some rules down below that I kindly ask be followed. These are in place to ensure I am able to help those who truly need it. It feels good to be back! 

1. Water bills ONLY. I can not pay or offer help on rent, electric, cable, internet, etc. I am so sorry. 😞 
2. Direct message for help, do not comment. This allows you to stay anonymous. There is NO shame at asking for help, but there is also no reason for it to be public. This is between us & no one else.
3. This is my anonymous account. I will stay anonymous & you can too. I do NOT need your name, address, number, or any of that matter. I only need your customer number & account number.
4. Please only accounts that are past due. When I go to pay the bill, I can see if it is past due or not. You would be surprised how many water bills stay in the negative. As much as I would love to help every single person, let’s help those who need it the most first. 🙏🏼 

I’ll leave you guys with two of my favorite verses & quotes. God bless you guys. “Do good for others and do good business”. - Me (AR) 😉 

Hebrew’s 13:16
And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.

William R Hewlett
