"Evolve and The Pointe at SIU are both fairly pricey apartments but the benefit is that they're fairly close to campus. Management at The Pointe is absolutely atrocious if you ever need any maintenance done or have any legitimate complaints/concerns. They're nice when they're taking your money, that's about it. 

I personally know the leasing manager at Evolve and he's super nice, the whole management teams seems super nice. I've never lived at Evolve, but I've never really heard anything bad about the place other than the walls are thin/noisy neighbors, and of course the price is high. The other perk of living at Evolve is you're within walking distance of all the main bars in town plus various restaurants. So it's an easy/safe walk home if you get too drunk.

I rent through a company called Five Star Realty, they have lots of properties in Carbondale, and the staff is always friendly in my experience. Not all of their properties are close to campus, but many are. They don't post all their properties on those popular websites like apartments.com, etc, so you'll have to check out their website or maybe call them to see what's available. 

Other options: The Reserves at Saluki Pointe are nice, safe apts that many of my friends rent from. However, these are about a 5-7 min drive from campus, you wouldn't want to walk from here to campus. Not sure if they have a shuttle service. Also you'll definitely be paired with roommates here, they don't have any one-bedrooms. But you'll want roommates to make it more affordable. You each get your own private bathroom in your room, so it's not a bad deal. G&R Rentals located on Grand Ave and Park St (their main office is on Grand Ave, they have apts right on Grand and some you access from Park St (the next street over). These properties are right next to The Pointe, for reference. I think the pricing is probably similar, but I think these apts are nicer than The Pointe (but they may not be affordable if you don't have a roommate). Also, there is University Village which is a very popular complex. Not sure of the pricing, probably similar to all of these, but these apts are nice. Wedgewood Hills is another nice one and very quiet, but I think it's a bit pricier than all the others.",t2_i59h0j7l,QuizCat_M,0,1648503949.0,0,t1_i2hnoko,i2hnoko,True,Current-Thing-6067,t3_tgoyy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carbondale/comments/tgoyy7/evolve_apartment_rsalukis_xpost/,Evolve Apartment?

"Edit: if you need a partner while in the area, or some more recommendations, hit up the Southern Illinois Climbing Forum on Facebook. It's pretty active and the folks there are, in my experience, pretty laid back and kind. 

For nearby hiking, Pomona Natural Bridge, Little Grand Canyon, Larue Pine Hills, and Cedar Lake are all on your way to the Holies, if you're coming from Carbondale.

Just down the road from the Holies are the House Boulders and the Hagler Rd boulders. Both are decently developed, though nowhere near what the Holies is. 

A short trip up Route 3 from the Holies is the Graveyard, though I can't really recommend it to visitors. It only has a handful of problems worth the trip IMO and it's usually dirty from low traffic, and the tops are sketchy. 

Giant City has a little bit of bouldering, a bunch of good rope climbing, and it's a great place to hike.

Farther from Carbondale but still very worth the trip are Jackson Falls, Fern Cliff, Bell Smith Springs, Garden of the Gods, and many more than I could name. 

Jackson Falls is a must if you have the time. It has some great bouldering, tons of absolutely awesome rope, and it's a beautiful place to hike. It also has free camping. Bell Smith is close by, and Garden of the Gods isn't much farther, so it's a good home-base I'd you want to stay cheap, climb, and hike without having to drive a bunch every day.

As for food, Blend isn't one I see recommended often but it's an absolute gem. They have great crepes and bubble tea, and their savory crepes are where it's at; the steak and mushroom one is delicious. Pag's is arguably the best pizza, though pricy. Their Big Red is hands down my favorite, but you'll drop $25 for a large.",t2_5oyo7p9,Tok892,0,1648243565.0,0,t1_i248fvq,i248fvq,True,ryvel_10,t3_tnex7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carbondale/comments/tnex7v/boulderinghiking_recs_near_carbondale/,Bouldering/hiking recs near Carbondale??,/r/Carbondale/comments/tnex7v/boulderinghiking_recs_near_carbondale/i248fvq/,3,r/Carbondale,0,3

"Keepers quarters and the Underground are the best places to eat dinner.  Mary Lou's or Harbaughs are nice places to get breakfast.  The Underground has a good brunch menu on Sunday too.  Lots and lots of good hikes.  Giant City is the most popular, and gets a little crowded on the weekends.  Panthers Den is off the beaten path a little bit, but a hike with a neat pay off.  Snake Road has inspiration point which is the best lookout in the area.  The Pamona Natural land bridge is a very short hike with a nice payoff.

"There are no good Indian restaurants here, unfortunately. There is an international grocery store next to the co-op in the Murdale shopping center that has great Indian stuff and basically anything you could need to make a dish from another country. 

My hubby and I aren't from here and have found the restaurants to be overall pretty bad; the service is awful and the food is hit or miss. The only ones we eat at anymore are Don Taco and Quatro's. There is a good vegetarian place called Longbranch but it is run by an abusive cult (can't make this up). 

Harbaugh's is great for brunch. We like China Wok for takeout Chinese, Hunan for eating in. 

Hairbrains is a great salon for women and men. I found EClaire to be too pushy in selling products to me (though it has been a while since I went there). 

I know you want local businesses, but after using Gator Automotive and other local places, I usually just go to the Walmart Auto Center now.

Definitely the pandemic has not made it any easier to meet new people lately, maybe that will start to get better soon. Where are you going with the hopes of meeting people?

"Hi! Welcome to the area! Whenever I moved to a new area, I always like to know where to eat so that's my focus here. There's lots of good restaurants in/around Carbondale. 

Chinese food: 
Hunan is always good - it's a little more pricey but they do have a good selection asian foods. 

New Kahala is a favorite of most locals. The owners are nice, food is good. What you would expect for a Chinese restaurant in a college town. I recommend checking it out.

Middle Eastern:
Aban Kitchen is my place to go for Shawarma, kabobs, or  falafel. My husband loves their baba ghanoush as well. 

Pita alley also has falafel, baba ghanoush as well as gyros so you have a few options there.

Diners: 
Mary Lou's is a local favorite. It is a true diner. They have all of the normal breakfast options. The pretty legs special or biscuits and gravy are known favorites.

Harbaugh's is a popular breakfast spot. They have a variety of breakfast foods: breakfast burritos, pancakes, French toast, eggs Benedict, omelettes, ect. This is my preferred breakfast joint.

Pizza:
Quatros. Their deep pan Quatro's challenge is very well liked.
And let's be honest, your kitchen cupboard isn't complete until you have at least one yellow Quatro's cup sitting on one of your shelves.

Italian Village (IV's). Great thin crust pizza. They have a salad bar option as well. 

Irish: Katy O'Ferrells in Cape Girardeau, MO is probably your closest option. Good food,  but over priced Irish wakes. The chicken boxty and Irish eggrolls were always one of my favorites

"Unfortunately, EMDR is not one of the therapies practiced or taught by the clinic. However, the providers at the clinic practice lots of other therapies to treat trauma, which have most of the same components as EMDR, minus the light. Lots of CBT therapies mostly (e.g., CBT, ACT, CPT, etc).  However, if you’re wanting EMDR, I know some of the therapists at Centerstone are trained in it. 

Hey that’s awesome! Congrats—starting medication can be a huge albeit scary step. If you feel like your therapy isn’t going the way you want it to, you can always bring it up to your therapist. We’re human and we only know what you tell us. 

It’s okay if you aren’t a student. The clinical center services both students and the community, and we’re currently doing both telehealth (I.e., zoom) and in person sessions.

I'm older, but the first thing that comes to mind is dropping by the Co-op and chatting with the people that work there, about fun stuff to do in the area, and checking out the boards, but I think with it being post-holiday, the college is out, and yeah there's not a lot going on with COVID still going strong (and going to get stronger with Omicron)...I think people are just hibernating, hoping Spring will be better.   
I'm curious about an atheist being interested in theology...(it's something I've always been reading about) -there's SIPA if you lean Pagan, but if you're comfortable with services, you might check out the UU church over by Parrish park. I don't go but they're generally a very friendly and open bunch of folks. And if you're into volunteering or it's otherwise up your alley, there is the Rainbow Cafe, and LGBTQ center.   
That age is really difficult. Either people are coupling/making babies or going back to school for another degree, or off seeing the world. But give it a chance.   
There are lots of great hiking trails all around (the Chautaqua Bottoms in town is nice, and there's lots at Giant City State Park) and Makanda (crystals/rocks/hippie stuff, good coffee) and Murphysboro (plant store, comic book store, good coffee...) are great if you need a shopping trip...

"Pretty tough. I graduated a few years back from Carbondale and would come back frequently because I had a gf and some friends still there. Even still, until I linked up with them or went to bars with them I felt like an outsider only 2-3 months after graduation. It’s a clicky small town.

I’d say volunteer at the animal shelters until you move, it’s an interest you seem to have. Those places, while it can be work, has people who do love to talk about pets like their fellow students without the harmful gossip.

"There's a reason rent is cheap. There's a LOT of crime and sketchy business going on in most of Carbondale. It's a college town but that college has seen better days, and attracts-from what I've heard-a lot of gang activity from up north.   
It has a lot of traffic issues too. Good town, good people, but choose where you live VERY VERY wisely. Lots of theft, of bicycles, cars, and a lot of scary stuff going on east of S. Oakland st.   
There's a Facebook group called WTF Carbondale, and I'm sure those folks could give you specific suggestions about places to rent, and also landlords to rent from. There are a lot of sketchy landlords too.   
Huntsville is a much bigger city and has a lot more business and industry going on. Carbondale only has the college and it's not doing so well...

"I get it-we just moved here, pretty close to sight unseen bought a house.SW Carbondale is where we landed-south of the Co-op. Decent neighborhood, more older folks than kids, but I do see some smaller kids on our street, houses mostly around 60 years old, so may need some serious work. I would say do not go east of S. Oakland St. and stay away from the few blocks close to Main/Walnut. The area just to the north of Main/Walnut is older, like Victorian homes, and I think there may be more crime up in there...The major roads around the college seem to have some pretty bad crime, and the apartment complexes apparently have a lot of sketchy stuff going on. I am not familiar with the NE side of town but I have heard there was some sort of factory there that has left toxic nasties...Also be advised the streets around here are laid out really screwy. LOTS of one ways. Oh, yeah and we have our own cult, so beware of anything to do with the Sufis.....

[Here is the ""snow route"" map](https://www.explorecarbondale.com/DocumentCenter/View/2704/Carbondale-Snow-Route-Map-PDF?fbclid=IwAR1sGOeilEpbO4-_UAgOAklHe_dB-N69vaca1iAdu4wAoKQBupRWpXZwmFs). The red are the streets that get plowed first, and what I found is, they are busier.  Even when it's not snowing. I live on one of them, and I would not let my kids play out front, because a lot of the traffic is going WAY over the speed limit. (That's a pretty big issue in every part of this town, and cops are pretty non-existent. Also drive defensively-college means a lot of young drivers. Pause at green lights because with no cameras, plenty of people run red ones.

The area around Parrish Park is nice, but again, if I were you I'd try to pick a road that winds around, is not colored red or green, or pick a cul de sac.  That area also puts you close to the elementary school.  The neighborhoods to the W and SW of that park seem nice, with bigger houses. But yeah if you're buying, be sure to have a good and thorough home inspection-look for something with a newer roof. Those can be pricey.

it seems the closer to a busy road, the more apartments, more crime, more sex offenders.  Also, check the [registered sex offenders list.](https://www.city-data.com/so/so-Carbondale-Illinois.html)

The college takes up a good 1/3 of the city I'd say. And it's seen better days...

But over all, we're lefties and we definitely feel at home here. I see lots of rainbow flags and I've seen a number of same sex couples in the area.  There's a couple of Facebook groups-one of which is for ""being neighborly"" but I got off FB so can't tell you the names, I think it was through the ""Buy Nothing Carbondale"" group, so check that page....also the WTF Carbondale FB page is a really good resource. I think it was meant to be something else, but it's become a good community page...

Carbondale/Jackson Co. are the blue zones. I've heard that some of the rural areas can be just as racist (and have a history of being as racist) as the US Southeast... Murphysboro has a better town, but I think overall more conservative...

But yeah check the FB groups because there were a lot of new people there, many with kids.

"Carbondale is extremely woke/pro-terror/anti-cop. The mall was raided and looted during the Floyd Riots. Then they freaked out when an MTF person was pepper sprayed because she was resisting arrest and rioted again even though it was clearly justified as they had given her multiple chances to comply (and I say this was justified as a non-binary person who has every reason in theory to be biased in favor of that person). It was later discovered the person was a transient troublemaker who had been arrested for rioting in Pennsylvania the previous week.

I wouldn't move here if you want to be a cop. You wont be appreciated. Carbondale PD is probably the most progressive department in the area but gets the most shit for some reason, Marion PD is openly and blatently corrupt.

"There has been an uptick in violence, riots, and every other crime across the country the last year or so. You can blame this primarily on the pandemic sending many people into survival mode, and the fact that people riot everytime the cops try to proactively stop a crime like when they maced that idiot that was resisting (and had been arrested for rioting in Pennsylvania the week before) and all of Carbondale freaked and said it was a discrimination against LGBTQ people when it was obviously justified (and i say this as a non-binary person). Marion is sort of the opposite of Carbondale in that its filled with a lot of super Trumpy, extra racist people and ALOT of anti-vaxx/anti-mask idiots and even more christian extremists.

"SIU was actually ranked as one of the best LGBT+ campuses in the country in an article released this week. I also know quite a few trans/GNC people down here and there certainly is a community here that will accept you. There are quite a few ""southern pride"" types around who aren't quite as accepting, but for the most part they won't bother you and there are plenty of bars/restaurants that you should feel comfortable at. (As I was typing this paragraph I heard the ""dixie"" Dukes of Hazard car horn outside my window)

Personally, there's two simple reasons why I love Carbondale: There's a lot of great, beautiful hikes nearby and the bars are super laid back and cheap. The campus is also really beautiful, in my opinion, and people tend to be pretty relaxed around. I can't speak about the BSN program but I hope you gave you some useful information.",t2_bk9tmdtd,ChrizBot3000,0,1630722689.0,0,t1_hbivesb,hbivesb,True,[deleted],t3_phiex8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carbondale/comments/phiex8/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Carbondale/comments/phiex8/deleted_by_user/hbivesb/,4,r/Carbondale,0,4
"As small college towns near the south go, it's pretty progressive and laid back. Carb isn't the wild town it used to be, but there are still some fun times to be had. There used to be a gay bar, but I guess now it's cool to go anywhere. My daughter finds drag shows in nearby towns.
SIU is half the size it was 15 years ago, but still has good departments and faculty. The physician assistant program is highly regarded. Nursing likely is good, too.
My advice is to call the department and arrange a visit and ask questions of the advisor and meet a faculty member if you can. Schedule a tour of campus (it's beautiful) with the admissions department. Then take a walk around the downtown and neighborhoods near campus.
The region is known for hiking and the wineries south of town.

"There are 5 nice smaller trails in Giant City: Nature trail, Stone Fort, Trillium, Devils Stand table, and arrow head. The first two are the most interesting geologically and historically.

Little Grand Canyon is about 3 miles long loop. Very nice. But you can't do the loop if there has been much rain since it goes along some creek draws. You can hike to the scenic point and back which about 2.6 miles total. You must go clockwise for this. Going counterclockwise to the flooded draws is pretty boring.

Pomona natural bridge is nice. But extremely short and best combined with either Little Grand Canyon or Cedar Lake trails.

Cedar lake has several trails. I recommend you park at  the boat dock or on the side of the road on boat dock road off of 127. Then head north along the trail. Take the wolf den leg and loop back lake side around the trail proper. Wolf den trail has many interesting mosses, lichens, and succulents.

Snake road in the Larue pine hills area is open to vehicles now, but traffic is still light. It makes a nice hike with gentle hills, through several distinct biomes, swamps on the west side and cliffs on the east side.

Kinkaid lake has a trail at the end of the gated service road near the spill way. About 2.5 miles round trip will take you from parking, to the path at the top of the damn,past a water fall, and tons second stream of several waterfalls and moss covered limestone formations. Exiting the path on your return you can take service road to the area where people go to enjoy sunning hear the spill way.

Giant city has a more serious trail with a primitive camp ground at its end, for a small fee.

Cedar Lake trails allows free camping subject to some rules which can be found on the national  forest service website.",t2_85asrixh,TheDevilsAutocorrect,0,1626466761.0,0,t1_h5fsuqn,h5fsuqn,True,axidentalaeronautic,t3_ollmi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carbondale/comments/ollmi9/fun_day_hikes_around_carbondale_below_8_miles/,Fun day hikes around Carbondale below 8 miles?,/r/Carbondale/comments/ollmi9/fun_day_hikes_around_carbondale_below_8_miles/h5fsuqn/,2,r/Carbondale,0,2

"First:  oh, I live here and **love** the local music scene, so I know!

Second:  holy shit! I love Rev. Payton's Big Damn Band! I just bought your latest LP up at Plaza.

Third:  knowing who you are wouldn't have changed my original comment; I guess my fear was that the SoIl sub - a general sub for **everything** SoIl - is basically dead (so is /r/Carbondale).  So it's hard for me to imagine a sub dedicated only to a *smaller subset* of ""everything SoIl"" being anything but... just as dead.

You have to grow it from scratch, for starters; with the current sub so very inactive, it's hard to imagine anyone being upset about them suddenly firing up (but being mostly about music).

On the other hand, I certainly worry about the local music scene lately, both due to COVID and SIU enrollment; maybe you could cross-post your stuff from the new sub here and the other place? I don't know what the Redditquette is for that, but if it's about Sothern Illinois or Carbondale in any way, I would welcome more stuff in the current subs (though I certainly understand your point about daily music posts, if it's really to be that often).

Check out farmers markets/yard sales on the weekends: going through other people's crap is always fun.

"The only gay bar closed down if you’re asking about that type of thing. 

There’s Tinder (met my partner there) and the LGBT organization on campus is quite large and hosted lots of opportunities to meet people.

The best value is mobile homes.  Particularly the trailer park at the end of Carico Street.  1 bed/1 bath for just under $300/mo.

Illinois statutory rape law criminalizes sexual conduct between 13 year olds and parties who are 17 or older, to say the least.

"Found this dog deep in Shawnee N.F. on remote road. Closest to Ozark. 

 No collar. Doesn’t seem in too bad of shape though. He jumped in front of my car, then circled around, following and not letting me drive away. Seemed very hungry (he devoured the bread and peanut butter I had) and very timid (jumped back when I’d try to pet or lifted my hand, seemed very skeptical) but after 2 hours he finally let me touch him and once I did he just warmed up and buried his head in my chest and finally jumped in the car. Very excited and anxious but very sweet. Also seems extremely smart.  Took him to the vet ER in Carbondale and no chip :(. Vet tech gave me a leash for him and it’s very clear the dog had never been leashes before. Anyway, they couldn’t  take him. Hopefully if his owner is out there and this dog is lost and wasn’t just abandoned then they are found. I don’t live here (live 3.5 hours away) so can’t stay beyond tomorrow afternoon...

"The cost of living is low, but the landlords are 95% slumlords. I’ve never lived in a place where the consensus is that no one ever gets their security deposit back. 

The university has been declining quickly and the respected programs have become less respected compared to what they once were. As the university continues to decline, so will the town. It’s becoming a place of impoverished, uneducated, and emboldened bigots. Carbondale is no longer the quirky bastion of progress in Southern Illinois. 

As an LGBT person myself, Carbondale businesses may be friendly in that they’re not going to refuse to serve you, but the gay bar died and all of the surrounding areas to Carbondale are areas full of hatred for anyone outside of the cis-het, white, Christian LifeScript. I’ve gotten nasty comments for wearing an RBG shirt. 

Leaving Southern Illinois was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. If you’re looking for the intersection of lower cost of living combined with more progressive ideals and the true Midwestern politeness, check out Central Illinois instead.

I wouldn't say that crime is a huge concern, but it's definitely there depending on the neighborhood. The apartment across from mine got raided by the SWAT team when I lived there.

"Purchasing a house in Carbondale may seem like an economical decision (because they are inexpensive) but you may not be able sell it or find a tenant when you are ready to leave. Enrollment at the school has plummeted over the past decade. Accordingly, town occupancy is also way down. 'For sale' and 'for rent' signs are a plague on the front lawns of the town. There is no scarcity of abandoned looking or unoccupied homes in general.

I'm not an expert. These are just my observations.  

Carbondale is a fine place to live, and SIU has a lot to offer. But fully research the market and if you can, talk to someone who has experience with that market before purchasing there.

"Also, I'm not sure it's fair to say the police are underfunded here. Watch the next time someone has a little fender-bender, and a *minimum* of 6 squad cars show up.

In some other cities, there aren't even enough police to respond when someone vandalizes your car and makes it undriveable--you ride the bus to the police station to make the police report.

There's also a global pandemic still going on, forcing the struggling brick & mortar stores and mom & pops to have to compete with Walmart and Amazon, even more than they had to pre-pandemic. A lot of people have lost income and are struggling. This area has always been in need of some major economic development initiatives, but it's so much more pronounced now, with the pandemic.

As for crime, shall we compare it to Chicago, St Louis, East St. Louis, New York, LA, Miami, etc.? No, bc there's no comparison. 

But if you pay attention very carefully, you might notice that crime gets to be at its worst here when out of towners pass through, especially over the holidays and school breaks. The officer that got critically shot was by people from Kansas. Those couple weeks when people kept holding up restaurants and gas stations a couple years ago...it was an ex-convict with long rap sheet from Chicago. They caught him and it suddenly stopped.

"I literally haven't used any of those terms since middle school.

Also, I've met some of the people that have gotten hired over me for I.T. positions, several of them have been objectively less knowledgeable and less skilled. Honestly its probably that the guys getting hired are usually normies where as I'm a fat, long haired, white guy. I blame republicanism in this area causing forced norms.

My problem with foreign workers begins and ends at the H1B Visa program and the shitty degree mill students that come out of certain nations. We shouldn't be allowing foreign workers in to do the job for half the cost when we should be forcing companies to hire out of the slightly more expensive, but home-grown American labour pool. If your here on a permanent basis, I have no problem with that as long as your not just working for peanuts to funnel money back to your family in \*insert 3rd world country\* where $300 USD is like being rich. If we removed all the H1B workers from the local healthcare and college systems the number of opportunities for entry level, self educated I.T. workers like me would skyrocket. Companies would be fighting over people like me. For an example, I've worked with one Indian I.T. worker that supposedly had a 4 year degree that did not know the difference between HDMI and DVI (without being shown), how to terminate a ethernet cable, or understand how standard remote controls work.

"By ""kill off Halloween"", I mean kill off the totally insane over-the-top street party/riot that happened every year (but that also was part of the reason people wanted to come here).  Google about ""Carbondale Halloween"" and... be amazed.  It got crazy.  Cars overturned, set ablaze, broken windows.  Good times.  Anyway, they started taking more and more drastic steps to curtail that, and put a general damper on the ""party school"" image (we were #17 in Playboy's top 20 at one point).  Sadly, they succeeded, and enrollment has declined steadily since (we **may** have started to turn a corner just the semester before COVID).

Anyway, Halloween isn't dead here:  it's just not going to make national news like it did in the past.

As a posted below mentioned, the ""Tree streets"" are generally run by kind of trashy landlords (though there are some nice places and whole streets (Elm comes to mind) that are fine/mostly fine - I'd argue that until it got painted, one of the most beautiful houses in town was on Elm, though I am biased being related to the former owner)).  And, if partying is your thing the ""tree streets"" are right there in the thick of it.

Avoid renting anything from ""Home Rentals"".  I've not been a renter in a very long time, so there are better resources for further info on that answer; there's a very active ""WTF Carbondale"" Facebook group where you might post about potential landlords and get opinions.  Of course, it's the internet, so you'll get five people who say they are the worst, five who say they are the best, and 10 memes of people eating popcorn.  But hey...

Anyway, welcome to town!  We're pretty friendly, and tolerant.  I hope you enjoy your stay!

But - at least before COVID - we were seemingly on an upward trend, so there's that.

There is a *killer* music scene (okay, maybe not **now**) with at least one entire ""House"" (""Lost Cross"") devoted to housing hardcore punks who constantly have live music and parties.  The singer-songwriter tradition is also a burgeoning thing here.

If you go to Murphysboro, my personal favorite is Molly's Pint Brew Pub. There is also Brews Brothers and Big Muddy Brewery.

If you go to Marion then there is John Brown's on the Square.

You should check out the Shawnee Wine Trail and Southern Illinois Beer Trail for more options.

My psychiatrist in the Health Center said he had ""multiple"" patients who were trans students.  You should be fine on campus, on the strip, in grocery stores, etc.

Carbondale is a fairly safe bubble, with respect to the ""red"" state stuff.  Honestly it's more dangerous to be a Trump supporter on campus.

"You should probably be just as scared of earthquakes (ie not very), as the New Madrid fault is nearby. 

About half of the year is non-tornadic potential. And even when there is the potential, you have major forewarning, which isn't true for an earthquake. Further, as others have pointed out, it's typically a very narrow area that is affected the most in a tornado (again, unlike an earthquake). I've heard from Californians before about tornado fears in the Midwest. I laughed when I heard them voice that fear. So should you. You're way more likely to get hurt in a car accident. (magnitudes more likely)

And if you're still scared, go to Faner Hall. Ain't no tornado going to take that thing down.

"Yes, and no. They do happen here but it's not like Kansas. It's usually windy but tornados in Carbondale proper are rare (knock on wood). In the 9 years I have been down here there have been 3 weather events that were significant. Check out the derecho from 2009, and a tornado that hit in 2012 west of Carbondale. I hope that helps, weather is just weather if you have a reason to move here just do it!

"I've lived here my entire life. While tornadoes are a thing in all of the Midwest, and we had an EF-5 just 40 miles away just 4 years ago, and about three times every spring and summer the weather man tells you to take shelter, statistically speaking you're twice as likely to be diagnosed with leprosy than you are to be struck by a tornado. And as crashmd says, this isn't Oklahoma. 

If you're moving here for a university job, you're far more likely to be sent packing when our state government fails to pass a budget, yet again.

"Here's a thing you might enjoy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Illinois_tornado_history

Every summer here, you will hear tornado sirens at least once. It's usually just a warning that the conditions are right for one to occur. Sometimes a funnel cloud (the beginnings of a tornado) has been spotted. And rarely, one touches down in a field somewhere. I grew up near Chicago where tornadoes are even less common, but we get sirens still every summer, so maybe I'm just a little desensitized when it comes to tornadoes.

Tornadoes are definitely something you should be mindful of, but Southern Illinois is a far cry from, say, Oklahoma.",t2_5wlwp,crashmd,0,1459905417.0,0,t1_d1rj2yw,d1rj2yw,True,[deleted],t3_4dilsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Carbondale/comments/4dilsd/are_tornadoes_a_thing_in_carbondale/,Are tornadoes a thing in Carbondale?,/r/Carbondale/comments/4dilsd/are_tornadoes_a_thing_in_carbondale/d1rj2yw/,2,r/Carbondale,0,2
