And everywhere I've mentioned has great vegetarian options. 

there is also a lot of history here, I've found cemeteries with revolutionary War veterans, old beautiful buildings, steel mills, blast furnaces and mine shafts in mill creek park, McConnells mill and Nelson ledges are great places to hike that are nearby. Poland woods and yellow creek are in youngstown; yellow creek doesn't get enough love. 

Mr Darbys is cool for thrifting, chalet premier and vintage estates are great places for a decent liquor and beer selection. Market Street furniture is my favorite place for furniture. columbiana has a lot of antiques. 

if you got questions, feel free to ask or dm or however reddit works, I'm just very passionate about the area

I know Warren has a bad rep but downtown on a summer evening you have great restaurants like Sunrise and West and Main. An awesome brewery in dave grohl alley - Modern Methods and a winery with a patio on the river - CharBenay’s. Then on Saturday nights you can head over to the amphitheater for a concert.

Plus, this about kills any hopes of turning the Mahoning River into a proper peaceful recreational space! All they have to do is put it underground through Downtown, but they’re too damn cheap.

The only place around here that ever sold solid and truly authentic Mexican street tacos was Taqueria Huasteca on Mahoning Avenue but COVID shut them down sadly.

"I had friends that lived on the east side in highschool. Hine St, Truesdale, Stewart, and back behind Cosmo’s barber shop was where I spent most of my time.

Granted these were families that had been in the neighborhood long enough to be established but they were left alone. Really it depends on who you are dealing with. Selling/buying drugs you might have a problem. Blindly trusting neighbors could be an issue. Having a bunch of expensive things around poor people will make you a target. I’m assuming you’re white because you’re asking on Reddit, possibly Hungarian, because of paprikash, so you will stick out but if you act friendly and not scared I think you’d be ok.

"Welcome!

For sure Mill Creek Park. Depending on where you're living now, you might be able to appreciate a lot of the food. There are SO MANY locally owned restaurants and chains, so it's really great to experience lots of food. That said, there's not a TON of diversity in the food itself. But what we do have is really great. Norma's has great tacos. Wedgewood has great pizza. Make sure you get Handels, like, pronto.

We actually have a good amount of decent coffee. Branch Street and Stonefruit are my favorites, but High Octane is good, too. 

Amish market is fun and great, White House Fruit Farms is awesome (especially in fall), lots of little produce shops/markets around the area too that are great.

I recommend joining local FB groups, which tend to be more active than the subreddit.

Good luck! Hope you enjoy the area.

"I say this as someone who's always extremely positive about the city of Youngstown and thinks people often over-exaggerate how bad the city is - The East Side's pretty bad.

There are some parts that are decent enough to live in since the East Side is so big that parts of it are actually pretty rural.

Mill Creek Park as others have mentioned, but also head out to Cuyahoga Valley NP, Allegheny National Forest, Quail Hollow State Park, and West Branch State Park. Smaller parks like Boardman and Austintown are both lovely small parks.

Sports:
Mahoning Valley Scrappers baseball, Youngstown Phantoms hockey

Also, Akron Rubber Ducks aren't far off and worth the drive there. If course Cleveland and Pittsburgh sports aren't far either.

K'nafa - Palestinian food
Kravitz - Deli

In terms of live music, definitely Westside Bowl. If you like vintage stores, check out Greyland Vintage in Downtown. In terms of art, the Butler Art Institute is actually very impressive for a city our size and I believe it’s free!

"Your last pic is not of the super bowl. That is only the Bahamas.  Super bowl is literally a giant bowl with hill climbs on all sides. It's closer to hoffmaster road side of hillsville quarries.  Awesome place. Everyone who rides atvs/dirt bikes/etc from the area knows about it. Lots of ppl that dont ride also know about bc theres big parties out at the Bahamas every wknd during summer.  Ppl walk in to Bahamas from hilltop plays on 224.  Technically illegal to b back there. Mainly bc of all the assholes that litter and do stolen vehicles. 

Yes there is a crane down in the quarry in front of Bahamas. My dad scuba dived in there a cpl times and can confirm. I've seen stolen boats, jet skis, trucks, u name it back there.  Kinda unfortunate bc otherwise they prob wouldn't try to close it all the time.  Cops seem to go thru phases of cracking down and then not. Plenty of ways in if your a local.  U can even park down on the railroad tracks by mahoning river and ride up from there too. Awesome place but very dangerous if you're not careful or familiar with it. 

Also, the back part of the quarries along hoffmaster road is hunting co-op with game commission so they actually patrol that side from time to time. It's only a small percentage of the entire area so not a big loss to just stay outta that part.  There's some cool videos on YouTube from a guy that goes out there n films.

"I'm hesitant to answer this question because my experience/background is different than what yours could be.

With that said, I didn't learn as much as I thought I would. But that's because my background was in business anyway (I have a BBA). Much of the program felt like a review of undergraduate work. In fact, you use the same books/do some of the same assignments.

There were very few written papers, a decent amount of tests, but lots of weekly assignments. Lots of spreadsheet calculations for the finance and accounting course. The Econ class was the most difficult but also the most interesting. For some reason, very few lectures. The lectures that were provided (with the exception of the Econ and Corporate Finance class) were pretty much useless. Basic format was ""read this chapter, do these homework problems"".

All the classes seem to be run by TA's who work for the university and 95% of all contact is through those TA's who aren't even at the school. (the TA's were like lawyers, other MBA holders, and stuff all around the country...kinda weird... Practically impossible to get a hold of sometimes, too).

The only interaction you have is the interaction that you make. To me, discussion boards don't count as ""interaction"". In the course that I started out with several of us formed a group chat and had Zoom study sessions on our own. That group pretty much stuck together through the whole program, but I have since lost touch with most of them. I recommend that you start one with some classmates that you enjoy talking too. Definitely makes things better.

I know all of that sounds bad... but...

...that doesn't mean the program can't be good for you. It depends on your goals as I said before, but lots of people in that program did not have bachelor's degrees in business. In fact, there were a lot of people in the healthcare industry with nursing degrees that came in. So for them, they learned a lot because they did not have a background in business.

I think it also depends on who's paying for it, too. It's a great value for what it is. It's a great school too. I would also argue that there are certain MBA programs that definitely WILL bump up your salary. You might have to move, but I would try to get into the best program you can - even if it's not local. Even if it's not AACSB. IMO, you will learn more in an in-seat IACBE or ACBSP program at a smaller school, than you will an online AACSB program.

Bottom line, if I had to do it all over again I would've chosen a different school that had an in-seat program.

"I'm gonna dispute this claim. It is a state funded university with a good reputation that provides a multitude of connections to future employers. Attend any career fair held by YSU and you will see the respect given to YSU grads. Sure it's not Ohio State but the degree with YSU certainly carries weight through the application process with potential employers. Everyone including myself has seen tremendous success with a degree from YSU soley because of the access to networking opportunities provided by YSU. An MBA from YSU will fair well in OH, WV, and PA.

"I don't mean this to be rude, so please take it as friendly advice.  To be blunt, YSU's reputation is pretty poor.  My suggestion to you is, at the least, finish your degree with a more reputable institution.  Make sure that the credits you are earning at YSU can be transferred to a better school about halfway through the program.  If they can't transfer, that ought to tell you something as well.  

Best of luck to you.  I did mine over ~5 years (part time at night, driving to Cleveland twice a week) and wish I'd had more advice from others before starting.

"My brother in law and sister both have the same story but on separate occasions. So there was a car accident back in like 2003 or around that time and 4 kids were drunk driving with their headlights off and got into an accident by the paddle boats and got their heads cut off (idk if there was an actual car accident this is what I just heard). so I’ll tell my brother in laws story first- I was driving through the park as a shortcut to get to the south side then my car stops working, I finally turn my car back on and in front of me was a headless guy! And I heard a scream then I floored it out of there. My sisters story is way scarier, her an her friend were driving through the park about 2 months ago and there car stopped working. So they put it in neutral and start moving, they see something at the end of the road and they thought it was a deer but it was the same headless guy but the detail and look she had on her face was so unsettling when she was saying this. She said the body was all decomposed and looks like it was in water and it’s head was cut off from the lower jaw and up. She then states that it starts running at them and disappears.

"I lived in the DC metro area for 10 years, drove 95 to get to work, 495 to get around, spent time driving around DC... you're not WRONG in that Youngstown doesn't have traffic problems, but OP really specifically is pointing out how poor optimization of roads and lights is contributing to the problem. The benefits of those larger cities is that the traffic problems, like sitting in rush hour, is mostly because of other people, accidents, etc. Engineers have worked and reworked those lights in cities so that they themselves help traffic as much as possible. (Except for in Silver Spring. idk wtf they're smoking in Silver Spring because rush out there sucks balls choose a lane) It's really frustrating to drive down a road you KNOW isn't busy but because the lights are jacked every single one is red all the time, so it takes you 3x as long as it should to get where you're going, while you're dodging potholes or snow mounds or whatever else Youngstown has going on.",t2_ny4jj,KirinoLover,0,1644498530.0,0,t1_hwd1lnk,hwd1lnk,False,J45c2_172driver,t3_sowzha,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/sowzha/the_most_annoying_road_in_or_around_youngstown/,The most annoying road in or around Youngstown ... and GO!,/r/youngstown/comments/sowzha/the_most_annoying_road_in_or_around_youngstown/hwd1lnk/,2,r/youngstown,0,2

"Hahaha.  I was born in Youngstown.  I’ve lived in New Orleans, worked extensively in Los Angeles, and have lived in Houston for the last 20 years.  I’ve some news for you… you don’t have ANY traffic problems in the Youngstown metro area.  None.  224, Midlothian, Market Street are easy to deal with in reality. (Snow does add some significant issues though). There might be some areas that you find annoying. I understand that completely. I used to live off Meridian so I understand your comments.   If you spend some time dealing with rush hour traffic in a big city where it might routinely take you 2+ hours to drive home from work, you will appreciate Youngstown traffic.  Bad weather and accidents will add to that 2+ hour total. A bad accident on a bridge might require a 20 mile detour (one way).

"The greater Youngstown area is mostly homebodies who stick with the same social groups they've grown up with their whole lives and don't stray from those too much, so it's a tough market. When you're 21, bars might open some better prospects. But really, it's a dying area, and the only people who stay there (for the most part) are those who epitomize suburbia in sticking with their same friend groups from HS or college in their 20's/30's, and the parents of their kids' friends thereafter. 

Are you a student at YSU? Maybe try joining a regular club instead of just one time events & see if something sprouts from that. That or via the workplace (typically only recommended for less-than-consequential jobs).

"Your best bet is, before you have to actually rely on the bus, take a trip to and from the destination you will be going to. A test ride so to speak. If you have any problems, ask the bus driver to help you sort them out. If things go horribly wrong on that first trip (they will), at least you won't be late for work.  
  
This coming from a guy who spent a year and a half riding the bus when his engine went kaboom. I spent more time waiting on my connections than I did actually riding the bus so give yourself plenty of time. Also, while waiting for the bus, don't stand close to a building or tree. Damn pigeons love crapping on people waiting for the bus. Take a book, mind your own business, don't look people in the eyes. Don't watch the movie 'Speed' before getting on the bus.  
  
Edit: I took a look at the website. Yeah, you're right. Your bus maps are seriously effed up! Such low resolution. Doesn't help that I've been away so long, I no longer know the streets. As best as I can tell, you get on the [#26 \(west?\)](https://www.wrtaonline.com/schedules/route-26-boardman-east-loop/) bus, take that to the Southern Park mall, get off, and change buses to the [#8 \(north?\)](https://www.wrtaonline.com/schedules/route-8-market/). Ask the bus driver to be sure.  
  
 In the old days we had to get a token from the bus driver when changing buses or trolleys. Now we have smart cards, five bucks allows us to go anywhere in the county for the duration of one day, just have to scan our card when we get on.  
  
I put the west & north because I don't know if your buses run both directions or if you have to take the loop. Doesn't look like it by the time schedules. If they do go both directions you can save time by waiting an extra 15 or 20 minutes for the bus going in the direction you want to go. That Boardman loop looks like a time sucking bitch. Learn your route, make sure you have exact change (if your buses still use money), you'll be fine. Good luck.

"The easiest thing to do is just put where you want to go into Google maps, hit the bus option, and it will tell you the buses to take and when. Right now it's free to ride. You'll have to wear a mask. 

It looks like you would walk to the red roof inn at 6am, take bus 26. When you get to Walmart, you get off and get on to bus 24. It will take you to McDonald's by 7:20.

Edit: I read 730. To get to the McDonald's at 7:02 you'll have to take 26 to the southern park Mall, get on 5, and ride it to market & Midlothian, and walk wherever from there. The McDonald's would be twenty minutes walk. 

If you can walk down to the shops at boardman park by 5:40 you can take bus 5 straight to McDonald's by 6am and wait.

"TLDR: After the city invested $10 million into cleaning up an ugly abandoned industrial brownfield and converting it into a park and amphitheater, First Energy plans to ruin the new park's aesthetics by running massive 60-135 foot power lines right behind the amphitheater on the park property.

&#x200B;

>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio – A proposal by FirstEnergy Corp. to erect an approximately six-mile transmission line along the Mahoning River is facing pushback from city officials and downtown stakeholders, who object to stringing the lines along the area were millions of dollars have been invested in recreational development.  
>  
>If FirstEnergy’s preferred route for the project is approved by the Ohio Power Siting Board, American Transmission Systems Inc., a FirstEnergy subsidiary, is expected to begin construction later this year on the line between the utility’s Riverbend and Lincoln Park substations in the city, spokeswoman Brittany Al Dawood said.  
>  
>The transmission line would help enhance reliability not only for downtown but also for surrounding wards in the city by providing an independent 138-kilovolt line between the two substations, Al Dawood said.  
>  
>“Benefits of a second electric source include improved performance, quicker and safer restoration options and more flexibility to conduct regular maintenance while minimizing service interruptions,” she said.  
>  
>Additionally, the project would support the existing distribution network that provides service to thousands of residential customers, St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, Youngstown State University, the Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre and other commercial and industrial facilities, she continued.  
>  
>FirstEnergy evaluated 49 possible routes, presenting a proposed and alternate route to the state panel that were preferred for minimizing impact on the environment and developed areas while enhancing reliability for downtown and the surrounding area.  
>  
>“These improvements will not only help reduce outages but will also increase capacity for future economic growth as new opportunities for employment and business development evolve in the Mahoning Valley,” she said.  
>  
>Economic issues are among the factors that opponents of the plan point to. Some shared their objections at the quarterly meeting of Downtown Youngstown Partnership, a Youngstown CityScape program that convenes downtown stakeholders including businesses and residents to address issues. They point to concerns about FirstEnergy siting the towers and power lines on the north bank of the river, where nearly $60 million in public and private money has been invested to develop the Covelli Centre and neighboring amphitheater and urban park, and the Handshake of the Century Statue.  
>  
>An alternate route, according to a map circulated at the DYP meeting, would follow the southern bank of the river.  
>  
>Sharon Letson, Youngstown CityScape executive director, acknowledged the need to address electrical issues in the downtown area.  
>  
>“We often lose electrical service,” whether by planned or unplanned outages, she said. “It’s because you’ve all done your job, and we’ve grown as a city.”  
>  
>However, placing the towers and power lines where public and private partners have made investment in the downtown area and, particularly, the river corridor, “just raises lots of red flags,” she added. It would jeopardize the investments that have been made that drive people downtown.  
>  
>“Utilities have a lot of muscle,” she remarked. “It’s important for us to take a stand.”  
>  
>Letson also raised concerns over the land clearance that would be required for the towers and questioned how the city could have park concerts with the construction noise.  
>  
>“I do know some of these other routes cost more money,” she remarked. “We’ve all invested a lot of money.” Additionally, she complained that the public hearing on the project was held in Campbell, not Youngstown.  
>  
>The Ohio Power Siting Board held a public hearing Nov. 3, 2021, to obtain community input, said Matt Butler, public information officer for the Ohio Public Utilities Commission of Ohio’s power siting department. Two years earlier, it held a public informational meeting in Youngstown to discuss the project with interested individuals and property owners.  
>  
>“FirstEnergy has worked for two years to gather community input through advertisements in local newspapers, letters sent to landowners along the proposed route and public outreach,” Al Dawood said. In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and limits on in-person gatherings, outreach and information efforts moved online, and a virtual presentation, including information on the OPSB approval process and how to contact the board, has been available since December 2020.  
>  
>She also said FirstEnergy did not choose the location of last November’s public hearing.  
>  
>“Throughout this process, FirstEnergy has remained in close communication with city leaders,” she said. “We are committed to working with city leaders as we go forward. Our goal is to provide safe, reliable power to the downtown area and surrounding wards while supporting economic growth in the city of Youngstown.”  
>  
>Those city officials don’t appear to be sold on FirstEnergy’s preferred path  
>  
>In written comments to the power siting board, Mayor Jamael Tito Brown expressed his opposition to “any transmission lines” crossing the city property that includes the Covelli Centre, Wean Park and the amphitheater, and recommended the transmission lines be installed underground.  
>  
>“\[A\]esthetics in the affected area is a strong component to attracting patrons of the arts, business developers, restaurant owners, and outdoor enthusiasts. A 138-kilovolt transmission line in the sight line will be onerous,” Brown said.  
>  
>“We’re overwhelmingly opposed to it,” added Charles Shasho, Youngstown’s deputy director of public works.  
>  
>Shasho cited multiple issues with the project, among them that the towers would be placed on city property. He also pointed to the effect on the aesthetics of the area, where the city most recently built the Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre and Wean Park.  
>  
>“I’m not excited about having aerial high-tension lines behind what should be the anchor of downtown,” he said. He also cited environmental concerns that haven’t been investigated on the property and pointed out that the proximity of the towers and lines could restrict crane access behind the amphitheater.  
>  
>Shasho, Letson and Eric Ryan, president of JAC Management Group, which oversees the riverfront venues for the city, also pointed to potential issues with the transmission lines disrupting the audio systems of the Covelli Centre and amphitheater.  
>  
>“In the event of any type of power line failure or malfunction, the impact upon human life could be catastrophic,” Ryan added.  
>  
>“No radio or television interference is expected,” Al Dawood responded. “The design of the transmission line will be in accordance with National Electrical Safety Code standards, allowing access through the right-of-way for maintenance vehicles and equipment at the amphitheater.”  
>  
>She also said the structures used for this project would include wood and steel poles ranging between 60 feet and 135 feet above ground. “Placement has been evaluated to reduce the impact to the amphitheater by moving the poles as close as practical to the tree line and railroad tracks,” she said.  
>  
>The siting board has not set a date for making a decision in the case, Butler said. The board typically meets on the third Thursday of each month and the agenda is set approximately a week before each board meeting.  
>  
>The board “takes all public and local government input into consideration,” including comments in the case record and public hearing testimony, he said.  
>  
>CityScape’s Letson urged those in attendance at the DYP meeting to contact the power siting board.  
>  
>“The sooner we express our concerns, the better for all of us,” she said.",t2_x1535,Dblcut3,0,1643773137.0,0,t1_hv8a886,hv8a886,True,Dblcut3,t3_siefpw,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/siefpw/city_leaders_opposed_to_first_energy_plan_to/,City leaders opposed to First Energy plan to build power lines behind Youngstown Amphitheater,/r/youngstown/comments/siefpw/city_leaders_opposed_to_first_energy_plan_to/hv8a886/,10,r/youngstown,0,10

"Branch Street Roasters is number one for me. They are consistently rated as some of, if not the best, coffee in the state of Ohio. They put a lot of care into their craft and it’s always a great experience going there! Everyone’s super friendly there and I always look forward to going back. Honestly, even compared to most coffee shops in bigger cities I travel to, Branch Street is way better. 


Sauceeino is my favorite restaurant in the area. It’s a mediterranean/Lebanese restaurant with a Chipotle-style ordering system. The food is super good and also really healthy. (They have really good vegan options too) The food is unlike anything else I’ve tried and the owner is a really friendly guy. 


Tebo’s Caribbean is another favorite of mine. Again, the food is excellent and the service is always great! I recommend the curry chicken!


Culturehouse Coffee is another great option if you want to try high quality coffee from a locally owned business. It’s on Elm Street just above YSU.

"Yankee Kitchen.

The place is a walking healthcode violation. They'll wipe their nose then handle your food with ungloved hands. One lady (seemed like maybe the owner) was visibly very sick and walked through the food prep area, in front of hungry customers, coughing and sneezing and handling food.

One patron there was so openly and overtly racist that even as someone who grew up in a staunch red state I was still taken aback. The staff nodded their head in agreement with the filth coming from his mouth, so clearly they were in good company.

Portions were big, food tasted ok, spent some quality time on the throne as soon as I got home though...

"Article without paywall:

>YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio — Standing narrow and tall near a busy intersection in Youngstown, Glenwood Grounds Café will celebrate its grand opening Saturday.  
>  
>Located at 2906 Glenwood Ave., Glenwood Grounds has been open for about a month. Built in 1925, the brick building is flanked by parking lots and has a modern, trendy and humble look to it.  
>  
>Inside, the walls are white and adorned with colorful art. The original tin ceiling is still intact, and hardwood floors add to the coffee-shop feel.  
>  
>It was a calling to serve a Youngstown community that led Gary Koerth and wife Cindy to start a new chapter. Koerth, a former pastor, worked on revitalization within the Glenwood-area neighborhood over the last decade. As the Koerths got more involved, they decided to sell their Austintown home and purchase one closer to the café.  
>  
>“We just fell in love with the neighborhood,” Gary Koerth says.  
>  
>Together, the Koerths began a new ministry, Hope for Renewal, a nonprofit which runs Glenwood Grounds Café.  
>  
>“We wanted to bring hope and peace, to try and restore that,” he says. “Our desire is that Glenwood Grounds will be a comfortable place for our neighborhood to gather for a great cup of coffee, awesome food and experience an atmosphere of community, care and hope.”  
>  
>It’s the Koerths’ mission to do community outreach, providing a sense of encouragement and belonging, they say. Hope for Renewal hosts weekly picnics from June through October as a way to bring the community together. “Our goal is to build community and build relationships,” Koerth says.  
>  
>They acquired the building in August 2017 and renovated the structure over the next four years, investing more than $150,000, Koerth says. Donations and volunteers have made Glenwood Grounds possible, he adds.  
>  
>Glenwood Grounds is in a food desert, Koerth says. Located near the corner of Glenwood Avenue and Canfield Road, it’s several miles until the nearest store or community place for gathering.  
>  
>It’s the first project of several in that vicinity, says Ian Benniston, executive director of Youngstown Neighborhood Development Corp. “We’ll be building more energy at that intersection” with a fresh market going into the plaza across the street from Glenwood Grounds.  
>  
>Branch Street Coffee is used at the café and is roasted on Glenwood Avenue in a YNDC-owned building about six blocks to the north of Glenwood Grounds, Beniston says.  
>  
>“I see this as another important piece in the overall body of work underway on Glenwood,” he says of the coffee shop. “It’s a good project. We’re excited to have them.”  
>  
>It’s within the busy Glenwood corridor, which commuters use to travel between Boardman and Youngstown, Koerth says. The hope is that word starts to spread about the coffee shop and people stop in on their way to work or to meet and talk business over a cup of coffee.  
>  
>“People can come experience care and encouragement,” Koerth says.  
>  
>While fresh-ground coffee and a few sweet treats are on the affordable menu, Koerth looks to expand offerings once business picks up. Baked goods, ranging from bagels, cinnamon rolls and muffins, will be served at Saturday’s grand opening, along with specialty coffee drinks, tea and hot chocolate.  
>

The cop hit his target. Apparently the criminal who died didn’t give a shit about the innocent women and children around him. It’s takes a real sociopath to shoot a gun up in the air and not give a shit if an innocent person is hurt or killed and here you are making excuses for them lmao. You’re no better than they are. The police officer had exigent circumstances going up against two individuals shooting AR-15 assault rifles and he eliminated the threat.,t2_fqvftnfi,AutumnBrooks2021,0,1641629760.0,0,t1_hrr6w9x,hrr6w9x,False,PreparedToBeReckless,t3_ry3mir,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/,The Canton Police Department released body camera video that shows the moments that led up to a deadly officer-involved shooting just after midnight on New Year’s Day.,/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/hrr6w9x/,1,r/youngstown,0,1

"You’re an idiot. Like I said from the beginning, it’s not common when it’s 300 shootings in the entire city when the population is 878,000 people. Less than .1% of the population is not considered common. When the shootings do occur, it’s almost always in the minority parts of town bc that’s where all the crime is. It’s not a shocker that criminals hate the police and are the ones being killed by the police.",t2_fqvftnfi,AutumnBrooks2021,0,1641628548.0,0,t1_hrr5a8y,hrr5a8y,False,PreparedToBeReckless,t3_ry3mir,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/,The Canton Police Department released body camera video that shows the moments that led up to a deadly officer-involved shooting just after midnight on New Year’s Day.,/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/hrr5a8y/,1,r/youngstown,0,1
Your such a fucking dishonest piece of shit. So now suddenly know you know it's  a common occurrence in minority neighborhoods but because their are drive bys there (???) shooting blindly through a fence at what everyone knows is celebratory gunfire is the right move. It's fucking insane. Fucking arrest them. I guess you don't have any firearms training. You do NOT fire at what you can't even fucking see.

Canton had less shootings than Columbus. Even the biggest cities in the country don’t come close to .1% of their population. That proves it’s a very small minority of people doing the shootings and it proves my point that it’s not common and doesn’t take place in every neighborhood like you claim.,t2_fqvftnfi,AutumnBrooks2021,0,1641627796.0,0,t1_hrr49ip,hrr49ip,False,PreparedToBeReckless,t3_ry3mir,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/,The Canton Police Department released body camera video that shows the moments that led up to a deadly officer-involved shooting just after midnight on New Year’s Day.,/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/hrr49ip/,1,r/youngstown,0,1

Columbus isn’t Canton dumb ass. You’re comparing apples to oranges and the numbers still show the percentage is very low. It’s the minority neighborhoods that have the majority of celebratory gunfire and they also have the majority of drive by shootings and murders. They also coincidentally also have all the problems with law enforcement.,t2_fqvftnfi,AutumnBrooks2021,0,1641627556.0,0,t1_hrr3xq1,hrr3xq1,False,PreparedToBeReckless,t3_ry3mir,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/,The Canton Police Department released body camera video that shows the moments that led up to a deadly officer-involved shooting just after midnight on New Year’s Day.,/r/youngstown/comments/ry3mir/the_canton_police_department_released_body_camera/hrr3xq1/,1,r/youngstown,0,1
