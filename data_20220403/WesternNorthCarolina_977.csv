"Rod Honeycutt's campaign started last October: the top three family-related issues he's heard most about beyond gas | inflation | finance topics (which are important):  
(1) Parents want options to get their kids caught up on their education and social development skills.  
(2) Grandparents are finding themselves raising their grandchildren, and   
(3)  7.8% of school-age children are homeschooled in North Carolina. The homeschooling community has a large presence in our area/unmet needs.  
The three listed are not necessarily related to one another. For Rod, these are ""top of mind"" topics that he's seeking more insights and solutions from people in this area. Add to the list of what matters to you.  
Note: I'm not an expert or caught up on the details so it's not worth a debate. The event is for people to engage Rod directly and have some ice cream.

Officers and Agents of Law Enforcements, in North Carolina, receive at least 3 to 4 months, and if you're a Trooper up to like 6 months of training. And a litany of on-going, continuing education on a variety of topics inside the LEO networks, training facilities, etc.

"I think Cawthorn is just... reading the room wrong. He's one of very few GOP standouts on the wrong side.

There are folks in my area of WNC who still fly Trump flags, have signs saying ""Biden is not my president"", but are now flying the Ukraine flag.

Cawthorn is just so used to getting cheers for disagreeing with whatever the media says that he can't actually bring himself to side with his own party or the constituents that put him into office.

Even Trump is (finally...) on the right side this time.

"The local community college bought an abandoned and run down hotel (was originally a school) and  Aquatic center. The original claim was that they were gowing to build a new campus and dorms in Spruce Pine, because the roof is literally falling in on the Early College building on their main campus. 

They went through a few architects who told them renovating the buildings would be millions, and to just tear it down and start new at that cost. 

Then the town hired a hotel consultation group “to get a branded hotel into town”. The council explicitly directed the consultants to consider a hotel in the site owned by the college. The official report shot that down, and noted the oddity of the council members making the suggestion (straight professional shade if you read between the lines).

Then the President of Mayland announced he was in the process of giving a “low cost lease” to the owner of Little Switzerland. This lie was pushed for a couple years till people demanded proof of progress and commitment to renovating the building. The Lil Swiz guy quickly claimed he never had any intention to invest the millions it would cost. 

So the Hise family (Senator Hise’s kin basically run the town) decided that town and county would give the community college another quarter million to have Senator Ralph Hise build and run a restaurant, bar, and hotel in the building with the profits going to the school where he is the Special Project Coordinator. 

Supposedly the money is to support the school due to decreasing revenue due to decreasing attendance (because they don’t even offer all the classes needed for the programs they claim to offer).

Of course, they also just created three new admin positions for recruitment, retainment and outreach (extremely redundant positions). 

It’s gonna be hard for other locally owned bars, restaurants, and hotels to compete with some socialist company that can get injections of tax money whenever it needs, paid for directly by the tax on restaurants, bars, and hotels.

That’s…not even really true. The main issue is with shady investors and appraisers intentionally purchasing land that can appraise much higher and then selling to wealthy folks to purchase easements for tax credit. Land trusts are not typically in on it. But there’s fraud in every aspect of our tax system.

"I live about 5 miles west of Canton in Clyde and it is more than noticeable, especially if there is westwardly wind. I would say at least 3 days a month are ""man that's bad I don't wanna be outside today"" levels of stank. Maybe another 5-10 days of slightly bearable whiffs of smelly. Then the rest is no smell whatsoever. However, I am further out than you'd be, so thats worth keeping in mind.

Summer seems better, I guess because of the trees scattering the stank that rides the wind? The smell is not only noticeable outside, but if you get a few stinky days in a row, your house starts to smell like it inside - even days after the outside smell is gone. I find myself opening my windows at least once a week to force fresh air in the house, which isn't the worst thing, but it's frustratingly pointless if it still stinks outside. 

If you enjoy the outdoors and are looking to be that close to downtown Canton, I would wholeheartedly anticipate dealing with the smell more often than not.

"Girlfriend and I decided to head up to pisgah hoping the roads wouldn’t be too bad after the storm and winds last night and we’d get to see some snow. We looked at mills river campground first before heading up the road and the only other person there was a man fishing with truck parked next to the river (important later). 

We head up road 5000 and the first roadside campsite to the left is occupied by a man that looked just like shaggy with a tent and no car. We waved and thought that was strange someone would be out here already without a car from the night prior being so rough. 

We continue up to the campsite pictured and usually let our dog out there because it has a nice creek he can get in. We had been up the same road Friday and the same camp was set up with people and a black truck. So we were awfully worried when we saw it. 

We got out and took pictures and figured we’d report it to the forest service as soon as we had service. We also called out to make sure nobody was still there or in danger. As we continued up the road we just kept having an awful feeling and decided to turn around and head home back through mills river campground. 

When we finally got back down to the campground we decided to look for a host figuring they’d be the easiest person to report it to since we hadn’t had service yet. As we’re looking around we notice the creepy man from the first campsite talking to the fisherman. At this point we have a really bad feeling and decide we need to stop and talk to them at least to hopefully warn the fisherman of something. 

As we begin talking the creepy man takes control of the conversation. We tell them that we saw a strangely abandoned campsite, etc. The creepy man starts going on about how he knows the people who were camping there, refers to them as his family, also says they aren’t the type of people to walk up on. Also tells us about three times the sheriffs already know about and have come out. By this time the friendly fisherman has gone from a friendly look to a very concerned one as the three of us realize shaggy here is acting extremely suspicious about this abandoned site. After telling him there was still one tent not knocked over with lanterns on he said he was going to grab a gun and go take care of it. We then finished talking and the fisherman immediately packed up and left just like us. As soon as we got service we called the non emergency line. They said the sheriffs came through earlier and had reason to believe it was a meth lab. They said they were going to send two sheriffs out to hopefully try and speak to the guy we did.",t2_88obc,HECK_YEA_,0,1641272743.0,0,t1_hr6cmin,hr6cmin,True,[deleted],t3_rvm0dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WNC/comments/rvm0dq/strangely_abandoned_campsite_in_pisgah_from_today/,Strangely abandoned campsite in pisgah from today (story in comments),/r/WNC/comments/rvm0dq/strangely_abandoned_campsite_in_pisgah_from_today/hr6cmin/,1,r/WNC,0,1

"Reddit sends out automated messages based off of your IP address (and other things) that they have access to. Because of that, they often send out recommended geographic subs, since they assume someone would be interested in talking about their area online. The message you probably received was sent by an automated system, not by one of the moderators of the r/WNC subreddit.

If you are using reddit on your computer, and you just started using it, you should be using the newer version of reddit. If you look on the sidebar and scroll all the way down to the bottom part of a sidebar, you will see a button that says ""message the mods"" which will message the moderators of r/WNC, and not the entire subreddit.

You can compare reddit to a newspaper, but everyone can submit an article. You essentially just posted this question as an article, so it's going to show up in all 20,000 people subscribed to this subreddit's feeds. That's probably not what you meant to do. I would recommend messaging the moderators of a specific subreddit if you have any questions. That button I mentioned should show up for any subreddit (in the lower right part of the sidebar).

"Hey! My wife and I grew up in Washington (Tacoma area and out near there coast) and moved to Boone about two years ago.

Things we love
- The nature. It's so cool to have all of these deciduous trees that really change the landscape throughout the year and we even learned to love the winter view of all the naked trees.
- all of the new exploring we can do. Moving to the opposite corner of the country means we have so many new places for easy day and weekend trips.
- the sunshine! There's a lot less shitty, depressing, oppressive overcast days.

Things we dislike
- the traffic in Boone. This is very specific to this city, though. Outside of the cities, traffic in WNC is great.
- income tax (but I think you have that in Oregon)

General thoughts
- I see less trump and confederate flags here than I did in Washington oddly enough.
- Most people are friendlier here which is generally positive, but occasionally someone is too friendly (read as chatty).
- Minimum wage is lower here and there are less housing protections and social services so you see more people living in poverty. You also see a lot fewer homeless people (probably due to weather, geography, and other factors). You also see more houses that are trashed and have all kinds of garbage all over their lots (not just cars).
- Housing will probably be cheaper here unless you buy a home in a city and if Portland is anything like Seattle housing then they're still probably cheaper here.

Does your wife have any specific concerns or questions? If so, feel free to ask.",t2_ao8hu,DerpanJones,0,1638555414.0,0,t1_hn3h70m,hn3h70m,True,xplant87,t3_r81d0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/WNC/comments/r81d0g/seeking_perspective_from_any_west_coast/,Seeking perspective from any West Coast transplants,/r/WNC/comments/r81d0g/seeking_perspective_from_any_west_coast/hn3h70m/,4,r/WNC,0,4

"""The $9.8 million Blue Ridge Parkway Visitor Center in Asheville, North Carolina features an award-winning film and exhibits which highlight the natural and cultural heritage, economic traditions, and recreational opportunities found in Western North Carolina and along the Blue Ridge Parkway. The visitor center houses a 70-seat theater, information and orientation services, and a retail shop offering books, apparel, CDs, DVDs, collectibles, souvenirs, and children’s items.

Nestled into a hillside, the LEED Gold certified building evokes a “tree-house” atmosphere and is projected to use 75 percent less energy than a comparable conventionally designed facility. The Blue Ridge Parkway Destination Center invites passersby to stop and stay awhile, attracted by the combination of modern building materials and green features, including the green roof. The welcoming approach from the winding road to the center highlights the roof’s sprouting flowers and drought-resistant plants that absorb the heat rather than send it back into the environment.""",t2_5mi4p,PlantyHamchuk,0,1635186706.0,0,t1_hi0l3uy,hi0l3uy,True,PlantyHamchuk,t3_qfn5qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/WNC/comments/qfn5qw/blue_ridge_parkway_destination_center_green/,Blue Ridge Parkway Destination Center - Green Architecture,/r/WNC/comments/qfn5qw/blue_ridge_parkway_destination_center_green/hi0l3uy/,2,r/WNC,0,2

"FTA: ""North Carolina lawmakers will soon vote on how exactly to draw the state’s political maps for the next decade.

It’s a big deal. The maps could go a long way toward determining the political makeup of the state legislature until 2032, as well as the partisan balance of North Carolina’s 14 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.""

...

""The public hearings Monday and Tuesday will have three options: In person and remote hearings at 3 p.m. both days, and an online-only hearing at 5:30 p.m. both days.

Anyone can walk into the legislature to give a short comment in person at 3 p.m. Monday and Tuesday. People who are free then but can’t make it to downtown Raleigh can consider going to one of the remote sites that lawmakers are setting up in eastern and western North Carolina, to call in to the hearing. Those will be in Charlotte, Greenville, Wilmington and Lenoir, depending on the day.

Make sure to sign up online first. Lawmakers are limiting the number of people they will allow to speak. Only 25 speakers at each of the three locations each day will be allowed, and each will get two minutes. The sign-up can be found at www.ncleg.gov/requesttospeak/60.

Finally, people who have to work during the day but want to be heard — or who are too late in trying to sign up for the in-person comments — can still weigh in, at the 5:30 session each day which will be held on WebEx. People who want to sign up for that need to go to www.ncleg.gov/requesttospeak/62 and enter their email address, to get a link to the WebEx hearing and further instructions. That hearing will be limited to the first 30 people to sign up for each day.

DETAILS ON REMOTE SITES
For the in-person hearings at 3 p.m. Monday and Tuesday, people can come either day to the auditorium of the Legislative Building, at 16 W. Jones Street in Raleigh, or to one of the remote sites.

On Monday, one remote site will be at Caldwell Community College’s Broyhill Center, at 1913 Hickory Blvd. in Lenoir. The other will be at UNC-Wilmington’s campus at the Lumina Theater, at 615 Hamilton Dr. in Wilmington.

On Tuesday, one remote site will be on East Carolina University’s science campus, at the auditorium of the Heart Institute, at 115 Heart Drive in Greenville. The other will be at Charlotte’s Central Piedmont Community College, in the Harris Conference Center at 3216 CPCC Harris Campus Dr. in Charlotte.""

"it's complicated

you have to remember the state legislation and citizens of surrounding counties like to make fun of the Asheville area.

Asheville has been so damn good at tourism that their tourism in Asheville has picked up and given tourism dollars to the surrounding counties just by having the Asheville visitors visit the surrounding counties and spend money.   the room tax which generates revenue not for the residents of buncombe county but for businesses in buncombe county to get free marketing.  the non elected tourism authority thinks that citizens have not helped in making Asheville popular and don't see a need to share the dollars with the citizens of buncombe county.  

now knowing buncombe county tourism has increased revenues for surrounding counties the state legislators in the surrounding counties don't feel a need to assist buncombe county in changing the room tax rules because they would be hurting themselves.  all this while the citizens of the surrounding counties speak of Asheville residents aas libtards and call them names.

so my summary is change the room tax laws and I think the citizens of buncombe county will be more welcoming as they will be able to use some of the dollars generated for things that they need for their citizens",t2_4y103,beaverlakenc,0,1632147473.0,0,t1_hdlda5c,hdlda5c,False,adamcouture,t3_pr6ufe,https://www.reddit.com/r/WNC/comments/pr6ufe/asheville_thoughts/,Asheville thoughts,/r/WNC/comments/pr6ufe/asheville_thoughts/hdlda5c/,2,r/WNC,0,2

"I appreciate your reply, and I want you to know that my comment wasn't directed at you specifically, but intended to flesh out the reasoning and emotion behind the some of the negative responses that came in reaction to your post. The unfortunate fact is that, when folks (myself included) read a post like this and encounter ambiguity, the past and current economic climate leave us inclined to read between the lines so to speak. My hope is that you intend to live and work within a community, not profit off of its economic vulnerability. If that is the case, then I am in full support of your endeavor. Over the past couple of years many of us have seen a rapid gentrification and devaluation of our surroundings. A modest price for someone in a another region may be a life's fortune to someone living and working here.

I hope that you didn't read my comments as hostile. I also hope you can recognize the concern that folks feel when they've seen friends and family forced from their homes because someone was willing and able to pay more for the real estate. I may have misstated my point by putting ""parcel"" in quotations and I don't intend to point to vocabulary as being representative of any intent or stereotype.  Most of the people that I know and call my neighbors appreciate an up-front and honest approach to interpersonal transaction within the community, and I think as a result we view vaguety with a small amount of suspicion.

If you have good intention then I sincerely wish you well, feel free to message me if I can clarify anything or if there's anything I can do to help you in any way.

The problems we've been seeing are not exclusive to Western North Carolina but to Appalachia and the Southeast as a whole... In West Virginia they're tearing the mountains down and in North Carolina we're covering them with apartment complexes and high-end private developments. Unfortunately, the issues I outlined can't be solved by turning a handful of wooded lots into twelve more Dollar Generals or new wedding venues, which seems to be the economic solution that's being pushed by outside developers.

The key to environmentally sound progress lies in sustainable development and the preservation of our natural resources. Otherwise, when the rivers are polluted and the hills are covered in asphalt rather than trees, the reasons that people visit and the reasons that many of us live here will be lost.

"You're being downvoted but you're right. There's too many people for the infrastructure and no way to expand the infrastructure without destroying the natural environment. And that's without even mentioning the issues we're facing with housing, food, and hospital shortage. Property values are increasing due to demand and wages remain the same. Unfortunately the working class that keeps these towns running can't afford to live here anymore.  It has devolved rapidly and right in front of our eyes.

Edit: Also, water quality has taken a huge hit in the last two years especially. Due to rapid development and lack of sewage capacity.

Edit #2: I also think it bears mentioning that most locals have no problem with people moving to the area as long as they respect the environment, the people, and the culture of the region. However, most people looking to acquire and develop ""parcels"" of land aren't looking to homestead or build and occupy a single family home.

">There is no justification, ever, in any way, for owning another human being

I agree. And I'll argue that there is no justification, ever, in any way, for intentionally killing an innocent human being. It's not nuanced. It can't be, or else the right to life is not a ""human right"", which we extend to all humans. Rather, it's a privilege extended to certain groups of humans whom we deem worthy.

It does not matter how small or undeveloped another human being is. It doesn't matter how dependent it is on someone else.  You can't kill your infant because it's too small to be missed. You can't kill a coma patient because they aren't conscious. You can't kill a disabled person just because taking care of them is difficult or inconvenient.

"Hmm. This discussion has taken an interesting turn. I do not want to chase you off because it is so rare, at least in my experience on reddit, to have a conservative actually talk rather than default immediately to Fox® approved talking points and meaningless shouting. And I feel like I am actually getting some insight I never get. But I have to question your analogy. Slavery is owning another human being; a living, breathing human being owned by another. Comparing that to abortion is, I'm sorry, ridiculous. There is no justification, ever, in any way, for owning another human being. There is so much more nuance with abortion. For instance, this new Texas law, at six weeks, many if not most women will not have even recognized a missed period. And the mass of cells inside her does not have a heartbeat. It has an electric pulse, like all cells, that can potentially become a life; many, many never do. They are not viable. Nature does what nature does. Sometimes at six weeks, or eight or ten or twelve. Yet Texas has decided that six month old mass of cells, a blastocyst, is a human being and that the so called ""host"" and anyone who assists the host in removing that blastocyst including the driver of a cab who drives the ""host"" to the doctor, can be prosecuted for murder or accessory to it. Do you support that? Again I am not baiting you. You seem decent and informed.

"I have lived in WNC ALL my life. I grew up in Burnsville, a little town close to Spruce Pine. Both are small towns bit growing with road development and many new businesses. You will he a little over an hour from Asheville, where I live now; and just a short distance from Marion down the mountain. Bakersville is close by and is very small. Winters can be cold, however, since my youth it is much milder here than in the 70s and 80s. Everyone is stuck during black ice. 4wd makes no difference in ice. I've always had one but use it rarely. I learned to drive in the snow and ice. Small Town living is peaceful and quiet. It's all in what you make of it and what you are looking for. It's a terrible shame you aren't looking for friends when you move. This area is also full of nice moderate mind your own business people. With small towns it's not so much being nosy as there are only so many people and everybody knows everybody. It really isn't that way in the area any longer. The closer to Asheville you live the higher the cost of living. Asheville is one of the highest in the state. Housing is ridiculous. I would never pay what my house is worth now!! LOL. The job market is similarto any place focusing on tourism for revenue. While there are drawbacks to our mountains, it is one of the most beautiful places to live. If you are an outdoor person, there are endless possibilities for recreation and employment. I once knew a woman who said, live where you really want to live and the rest will be ok.

"I'm from the neighboring county (Yancey) but I can tell you what I know. Mitchell county, like Yancey, is slightly worse off economically than areas like Madison and Avery but has some great qualities. It is definitely less touristy than the Asheville, Boone/Avery, and Smokey Mountains areas. Roan mountain is beautiful, Penland school of arts is there, and downtown spruce pine has a lot going for it. There is a significant artisan community between Mitchell and Yancey - particularly in glassblowing. They will have open studios and attend the craft fairs and the sorts. Up past Bakersville and the Popular area is very rural and gorgeous.

Most people grocery shop at Ingles, which is right in Spruce Pine. The roads do get icy but it typically doesn't last a really long time.

It is a generally Christian conservative Appalachian community so be aware if you are not used to that. But that means you can find rodeos (Arbuckle for example) or maybe even a mudsling, if you are interested.

I have found that there are two sides to Yancey and I assume this applies to Mitchell as well. It can be rough and rowdy, usually away from the towns, but it will only affect you if you let yourself get involved with it since it is so rural.

"Hi! I own a small cottage in Bakersville north of Spruce Pine though we live in Raleigh full time. It’s a cute little town but it is a VERY little town. There are a few fast food options and restaurants, a Walmart, and an Ingles grocery (so Walmart isn’t the only grocery option but it’s not like you have a lot of choices. You will likely end up in Walmart for something). There is a cute coffee shop/lunch spot downtown that we always stop at and a lovely little park our daughter enjoys when we come through. 

It’s close to the Blue Ridge Parkway, and I-40 is about 30m away past Marion. Most main roads are passable all winter but you are in the mountains so if you live up a dirt road or one that’s not state maintained it might get snowy/icy. But like most places you can get around if you are close to paved roads unless there’s a major storm. 

Not sure where you’re relocating from but it is rural and with that comes things like racism, homophobia, lots of anti-mask/anti-vax heavily religious folks. It’s not everyone of course, but comparing to say, Raleigh, it can be a jarring adjustment to see 10x more churches than businesses.

Innovation is the best brewery, Lazy Hiker is alright but it’s just a satellite location, their brewery is in Franklyn. Nantahalla Brewery was kinda lame but it’s the only brewery that sells hard liquor. 

For bars. Dark Moon is great for a fancy cocktail or two. Pricey but a real intimate setting. It’s a coffee house by day.

"I’ve always heard the opposite. I learned this in school from an administrator, so take it with a grain of salt. Reimbursement for deliveries is low. It’s usually a package reimbursement that includes x number of prenatal visits. On the opposite end, running and L&D is very expensive, like mission has 2 staffed ORs running at any given time, but they are mostly unused at night except for emergency c-sections. But they have to be ready at a moments notice because you never know when any one or two of the laboring patients will need a STAT c-section. That is a ton of money a hospital has to spend and not see any return. The way you make up for this is to have a high volume of deliveries that keeps a good patient census and keeps the OR and surgeons busy. That’s why smaller hospitals really struggle to keep ORs open, and hospital systems try to consolidate all the births to one place.

Of course they have it in their DNA to attack people, as the very recent story I posted demonstrates. The girl was sleeping and was pulled from her hammock by her head. 

Not only that, the attack occurred in the smokies, a park which shares a border between WNC and ETN. In fact, the area is so intertwined between the two states that you can buy a TN fishing license and fish anywhere in the park (even in the NC sections) and it still counts.

You asked me about Luther West, Dad's brother.  Well, I found something in Ramona's history of the West family.  Luther was interested in a girl but I guess changed his mind and went into the Army.  He was stationed in Ohio and then New York.  He came home on leave and was going to a box supper when Tom Jordan and Lee Wiggins came by to go with him, Tom borrowed some shells for his pistol from Luther and they left.  At the supper Tom and Lee got into an argument and Luther went over to calm them but Tom turned and shot Luther and he died there.  John B. West, Grandpa West, offered a $100 reward and the Governor matched it but Jordan's family smuggled him out of the state to Minnesota.  John West hired a detective to find Tom and he was brought back to stand trial but he was released until it was time to stand trial, I guess on bail.  Later Tom came back and thought nothing of it but he and another man went to visit a man named Dee Colvan and he didn't trust them so he sneaked out of his house with his gun and went around the house and shot Tom and also the fellow he was with.  Luther died on Nov. 7, 1913 and was buried next to his brother Americus (he was the son killed in the train tunnel that Matthew found) in Valleytown Cemetery.
