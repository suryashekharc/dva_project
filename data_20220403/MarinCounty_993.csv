Anyway, I really think scientific evidence can support how much we perceive the world around us is a result of something going on internally, our brain interprets and even create the world we perceive and experience.

Later with more positive emotion and social confidence this impression melted away utterly.

It can be hard moving somewhere new and having to meet new people.

"Sounds like a covert contract. 

>Covert contracts: The idea is that “Nice Guys” (and of course there are “Nice Gals” too, but the book is written for men) aren’t all that nice. They’re playing the part so that they’ll get what they want. They think:

>>""IF I can hide my flaws and become what I think others want me to be
THEN I will be loved, get my needs met, and have a problem-free life."" -Robert A. Glover, *No More Mr. Nice Guy*

>This is called a covert contract. **If I do X, then you’ll do Y, even though neither of us have acknowledged it.** Of course, the other person has no idea this is happening; it’s all in the Nice Guy’s head. So the Nice Guy doesn’t get what he wants.

>And this isn’t just your average everyday implicit expectation. In this case, the Nice Guy feels like he’s been cheated. He thinks the other person owes him and didn’t hold up their end of the bargain (which they didn’t know existed). So he ends up disappointed and frustrated, which manifests in not-at-all-nice behavior: passive aggression, isolation, clinginess, rage, all sorts of stuff.

"I was thinking exactly the same thing. I'm still distancing from people and not getting into long chatty convos with strangers due to being careful.

Plus everyone in this country is actually having trouble with acting crazy during the pandemic. [Why are people acting so weird](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/03/antisocial-behavior-crime-violence-increase-pandemic/627076/) from The Atlantic.

>Everyone is acting so weird! The most obvious recent weirdness was when Will Smith smacked Chris Rock at the Oscars. But if you look closely, people have been behaving badly on smaller stages for months now. Last week, a man was arrested after he punched a gate agent at the Atlanta airport. (The gate agent looked like he was about to punch back, until his female colleague, bless her soul, stood on some chairs and said “no” to the entire situation.) That wasn’t even the only viral asshole-on-a-plane video that week.


>In February, people found ways to throw tantrums while skiing—skiing. In one viral video, a man slid around the chairlift-boarding area of a Canadian resort, one foot strapped into his snowboard as he flailed at security guards and refused to comply with a mask mandate. Separate footage shows a maskless man on a ski shuttle screaming, “There’s nobody wearing masks on any bus in this goddamn town!” before calling his fellow passenger a “liberal piece of shit” and storming off.

>During the pandemic, disorderly, rude, and unhinged conduct seems to have caught on as much as bread baking and Bridgerton. Bad behavior of all kinds —everything from rudeness and carelessness to physical violence—has increased, as the journalist Matt Yglesias pointed out in a Substack essay earlier this year. Americans are driving more recklessly, crashing their cars and killing pedestrians at higher rates. Early 2021 saw the highest number of “unruly passenger” incidents ever, according to the FAA. In February, a plane bound for Washington, D.C., had to make an emergency landing in Kansas City, Missouri, after a man tried to break into the cockpit.


>Health-care workers say their patients are behaving more violently; at one point, Missouri hospitals planned to outfit nurses with panic buttons. Schools, too, are reporting an uptick in “disruptive behavior,” Chalkbeat reported last fall. In 2020, the U.S. murder rate rose by nearly a third, the biggest increase on record, then rose again in 2021. Car thefts spiked 14 percent last year, and carjackings have surged in various cities. And if there were a national tracker of school-board-meeting hissy fits, it would be heaving with data points right now.

"Wife and I made the same move once - went from Seattle Area (Fox Island) to Marin.

Landed in Fairfax. We love to see live music, rock and roll, and the counter culture generally (plant based diets, green activism, progressive social politics) so it was a perfect fit for us. You'll certainly find the most granola / barefoot vibes in Fairfax if that's your thing.

It was a great change for us and certainly sunnier. We missed the culture of the Northwest a lot though, as that is my wife's home - you can take the Seattleite out of Seattle, but you can't take the Seattle out of the Seattleite...

The big gotcha is you're pretty stuck / immobile between the hours of (approximately) 7am-10:00am and 3pm-7pm. This became frustrating and not something we enjoyed living with. Even coming from Seattle area! Bay Area traffic is on another order of magnitude.

 Especially as tucked away as we were in Fairfax. It's the same wherever though - San Anselmo, Novato, Terra Linda, etc., all really just hard places to be during peak traffic hours. wherever you are , don't expect to get anywhere fast during those daily peak hours of traffic.

My wife worked from our home in Fairfax and (every day) would spend 60-90minutes roundtrip during rush hour just to drop our son off at daycare in the morning (only a few miles from our house ... ). I'd do the pickup in afternoon as daycare was near my office, so she didn't have to deal with it twice. The congestion and overcrowding was just ridiculous though, after a few months we were beyond sick of it.

when we finally left the bay area it was a great relief - we joked after leaving that ""the bay area is cached"", and it pretty much feels that way still. was a lot more liveable 10-20 years ago than nowadays.

however, the PNW has gotten itself way overcrowded and congested as well.

if I had to choose, I'd definitely rather live in Marin than downtown Seattle any day.

sidenote, if wondering, we now live in Madison WI. parking is basically FREE everywhere (ok, it cost us $8 to park over night downtown once, lol) - We own a 4,000 sq foot home with 6 bedrooms,  2 acres and a pool. I'm with my kids for 2hrs each morning and from 5:30pm-bedtime every night.  it takes us just 20 minutes to get anywhere we need to go., and we are still earning tech wages from life on the West Coast so ... yeah :-)

"Alright, here goes. North to south. I am from novato so this might be slightly biased. If you have any more questions, feel free to reply to this or DM me😁

Novato: small town vibe, people are much less snobbish than the rest of marin, safe, although not as safe as Mill Valley and other south marin cities. The downtown is small and cute, but I would recommend neighborhoods like Black Point (AMAZING views of the bay + secluded feel while being convenient) and San Marin(Safe, cute, nice people, view of mt. burdell) Novato is also pretty warm, and there is a noticeable difference, as South Marin is usually colder. Fog can almost only be found on Highway 37 in the early morning, because it is almost a bowl, but it goes away by 7ish. Novato also has the least amount of traffic in the county, because of wider streets, and is mostly flat. Despite being near water, the only bay-related thing in the city is a small, single lane boat launch on the petaluma river in black point. This is in stark contrast to our next city, which is…

San Rafael: same size as novato but feels bigger, and has more problems, from crime to drugs, although they are mostly concentrated in downtown and the canal. SR has a lot of things on the water, from yacht clubs to restaurants. Terra linda is also pretty nice, although not near water.

Larkspur and Corte Madera: we start the descent into snobbiness. They are a good mix, being not too expensive, but still with good schools. Crime is also pretty low, except for smash and grabs. My rule is the closer you are to the richmond san rafael bridge, the more likely your car is going to be broken into. 

Ross: The richest of the rich, and the snobbiest of the snobby, this town has 0 affordable housing, which reflects the attitude of the residents. If you are rich, they’ll be nice to you.

Tiburon and Mill Valley: several times more expensive than Novato, Larkspur, etc, similar schools to larkspur and corte madera, very snobby people, and always foggier and colder than north marin. Mill Valley offers a very private secluded feel, although it is relatively inconvenient if you are far from the highway. Tiburon boulevard is a mess with traffic, but otherwise is pretty nice. The weather is hit or miss. If it is foggy, you can’t see anything, but if it is clear, the views are beautiful. 

Marin City has a disproportionate amount of crimes compared to other areas, and mostly low income families live there. 

Sausalito, on the other hand, is incredibly similar to tiburon, but with a larger downtown and slightly more to do.

Fairfax and San Anselmo are jam-packed full of hippies, and the roads are so badly maintained, that San Anselmo gained the nickname “San Anslumo”. The only well-maintained road, Sir Francis Drake (not for long in fairfax) has too much traffic, and is nicknamed “the miracle mile”. San Anselmo also has flooding issues.

West Marin is incredibly beautiful, and varies from rolling golden hills as far as the eye can see (Tomales, Nicasio) to a secluded forest feel (San Geronimo, Woodacre, Lagunitas) to a coastal feel (Point Reyes, Bolinas, Dillon Beach). West Marin is arguably the safest part of the county, but doesn’t have very much commercial activity outside of a small-town shop or two, and it usually takes 20+ minutes just to reach 101.",t2_e3thnhq9,Tracer_Bullet1010,0,1648612617.0,0,t1_i2oa0nf,i2oa0nf,True,PersistentQuestions,t3_tqnucl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marin/comments/tqnucl/what_is_the_vibe_of_the_different_towns_in_marin/,What is the vibe of the different towns in Marin?,/r/Marin/comments/tqnucl/what_is_the_vibe_of_the_different_towns_in_marin/i2oa0nf/,3,r/Marin,0,3

Two years into living in San Rafael and love it. Can’t really speak other Marin cities all that much. Mill Valley feels like the classic upper class Marin vibe. Compared to San Rafael where I feel like it is more accessible to someone whom grew up with less means but can also afford to live in Marin now. It feels like more of a mix with affluence and blue collar. Novato to me fells more like the burbs but also has beautiful spots. Novato is definitely a more difficult commute to the city. I commute to the city 3 days a week and it feels very doable from San Rafael.

"Fairfax is where you're most likely to find white women in dreads. Also maybe the place you're most likely to smell cigarette smoke on the regular, (other than downtown San Rafael). Easy drive to west marin, traffic can be bad going towards the city.

San Anselmo used to be a lot of boring boutique shops, now you're more likely to find coffee shops with little personality and white women wearing linen and more children than you'd expect. When it rains, a big chunk of San Anselmo floods. Traffic in, traffic out.

Ross is rich people that aren't really interested in people who aren't rich people in Ross. Traffic in, traffic out.

Kentfield is community college kids mixed with people who aren't quite rich enough to live in Ross. Traffic in, traffic out.

SFD starting in Kentfield and all the way to 101 has a pretty samey vibe of people who don't really like SFD but live on it anyway. Traffic.

Larkspur/Corte Madera are pretty similar, as close to a ""suburbs"" feel as you're likely to get in southern Marin. Traffic. 

Novato is the most big box store there is in Marin. Big Suburbs vibes, undeserved reputation of being the red-headed step child of cities in Marin. Roads are wider, less trafficky than the southern towns.

"Nice that your company reimburses commute costs - I get a stipend but it gets nowhere near covering the ferry to SF. The ferry is stupid expensive for commuting, and worse if you're paying for the parking (which used to be free). 


I can't comment on existing capacity, but pre-covid it exceeded capacity by the end of the morning. 


A few other thoughts:


1) Have you considered the bus (GGT)? For me in southern marin, between getting to the ferry, parking, leaving parking lot (huge PITA when its full), cattle call of getting on/off ferry, and distance to my office, bus was way faster and less annoying. Obvi this is affected by your home/office proximity to ferry/bus, and the available bus lines. GGT cut a bunch of good bus routes/times. Bus is also way cheaper but sounds like not a concern for you.

"The honest problem with the LEO, is that they don’t want to do anything that is not simple and easy.

That combined with $ on their mind, meaning if two similar crimes are committed, one is only a $70.00 fine and the other is a $10,000.00 fine, the police will ignore the low paying crime every time. 

That leads to the homeless problems, no $ in it = no concern for them. Happiness is costing someone $ not stopping a crime.

"SRPD has become a joke of an agency. To be fair- they are short staffed, but that doesn’t excuse their indifference to crime when they arrive on scene. Many of the officers I have dealt with in recent years are far more concerned with being social justice warriors than they are enforcing the law- they are glorified social workers (bringing blankets to bums, administering narcan to junkies, etc).
SRPD turns a blind eye to homeless related crimes… I have filed countless reports/called numerous times over the years for incidents involving bums breaking in to private property/stealing, bums destroying private property. I have even had to call for a bum high on meth openly masturbating in a private/highly visible parking lot (in broad daylight)- the location was less than .5 miles from the station and it took SRPD 40 mins to respond. The worst part?!? If hadn’t insisted on signing a citizens arrest, SRPD was going to cite the guy and release him!! Keep in mind, when SRPD arrived on scene, they caught him naked “committing the offensive act” - he was surrounded by pornographic magazines AND they found meth & a pipe on him- yet SRPD was going to let him go with a citation/court date!! My husband is LE for a different agency, so I knew that If I signed  a citizen arrest form they would have to book him (but the responding officers never made that option available to me- I needed to request it!).
Another very upsetting ongoing issue I have w/ SRPD- there is a group of 5+ known felons/drug dealers (some of which have been arrested for unregistered fire arms) who stand on Tamalpias Ave all day long- loitering on the sidewalk- blasting music/drinking tall cans out of paper bags and deal drugs right out in the ope, they make ZERO effort to hide what they are doing. This operation has been going on for 3years… I have reported them to SRPD countless times, and I have asked officers to occasionally drive down Tamalpias Ave hoping that added police presence would deter the to blatant criminal behavior- but they refuse to do anything about it. All of the officers I have spoken to are aware of the drug dealing- they know it is a huge problem/is bringing crime to the area… but they will not take action. I work in property management right downtown and we have had to resort to hiring private security to patrol our complexes 2x every night to deter break-ins & homeless trespassing. We have had to add 8 security cameras at one of the complexes (cameras only document crimes as they are being committed - unfortunately cameras don’t deter drug addicted vagrants from breaking in/burglarizing the building ). So every time some drug addicted bum breaks into the secure complex- I have to download the security footage of the crime, put it on a flash drive and take it to SRPD because they will not do any of the legwork themselves. They won’t even come to the building to view the footage/take a report. 

I want to make it known- that I have great respect for LE, I Know what a stressful/thankless job it is. But SRPD has some serious issues with their officers- maybe there is a moral problem w/ in the department?!? I do know that a majority of SRPD officers do not live in Marin/San Rafael- they are not from the area, I get the impression that because they do not live in the area, they do not have a connection to the community and therefor are not proactive about preventing crime/holding offenders accountable and preserving safe/clean neighborhoods for it’s residents. It DID NOT used to be this way, 20+ years ago San Rafael PD  had an upstanding team of officers who prided themselves in maintaining safe/clean neighborhoods… but almost all

"1. Basically white people are the upper class, Latin American are the working class. Anything considered white nowadays, like Jewish and all variety of European. Latin American I am pretty sure predominantly Mexican and Guatemalan.

2. Ross is mega-rich. Owning a high end Lexus and sporting a fresh new Patagonia sweater and iPhone is the bare minimum. Some people have a private driveway with their collection of 10 luxury cars including Rolls Royces. I heard someone had a private helicopter once, no idea how that’s possible though in terms of actually taking off. There are some solid down to earth relatable and very friendly, good people there but there are definitely some really stereotypical Marin people… extreme affluence makes people full of themselves, sometimes. They can’t believe they would have to deal with an inconvenience, sometimes, like standing in line, or fighting over their husband’s estate with their maid who managed to get them to include them in their will or something. Plenty of botoxed 60 year olds, and mega high end power yoga studios and so on. In some ways Ross is the most concentrated version of Marin, it’s an insanely white, super rich suburbia. People can be as fundamentally kind, intelligent and humane as anywhere but there’s probably a pretty big expectation for things like getting into top-notch private schools or just a really luxurious kind of leisure lifestyle. I heard housewives of Ross doing coke together is a real thing.

3. Marin has the stereotype of being really liberal Green hippie and the average is probably skewed that way, like I think even the conservatives are relatively pro environment and marijuana and stuff like that. But especially amongst many rich people people are a bit more conservative in some ways - racism against Blacks I have seen firsthand - pretty pro-Israel, lots of Jewish people overall - support for center-conservative figures like Mitt Romney, like free market economics and stuff like anti-socialism, against public services and so on. People enjoy and want to maintain the class hierarchy. It could not be more palpable and evident in Marin, the rich whites with mansion and the Mexicans who work as busboys in restaurants and butchers in the grocery store. As soon as you hop over to Fairfax you get people who are more or less stereotypical Green Party people.

4. I have no idea what it was like in the 60s but more recently young people are probably pretty sheltered and privileged but still open minded and good people.",t2_ezrsngk9,jssmith42,0,1647879400.0,0,t1_i1jnwg0,i1jnwg0,True,MemishInvestor,t3_tdf1fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marin/comments/tdf1fo/questions_about_ross_ca_for_a_book/,"Questions about Ross, CA for a book",/r/Marin/comments/tdf1fo/questions_about_ross_ca_for_a_book/i1jnwg0/,2,r/Marin,0,2
"Point Reyes without question or that whole general area. Like Shell Beach on the Tamales Bay, Drake’s Beach. 100% magical over there.

Top of Tam is impressive in its own way but it doesn’t have this raw overpowering beauty that Pt Reyes has.

I also find drives through the Valley (San Geronimo) to be some of the most inspiring views in the area.

The best hike I know is Taramancho, really nice rolling hills and a lot of varied open expanses and views and so on.

A really cool discovery I made later in my life is Muir Beach. It’s so cool how these big boats come through there sometimes, like industrial or shipping boats or something. It’s just an interesting conjunction somehow, because you’re not expecting it as much in that environment.

Insalata’s is a really excellent restaurant, the food’s great, as is its sister restaurant Marinitas.

I always go to Robson Park in San Anselmo when I just need to cook off in a way and lie down somewhere. Listened to a lot of music there. And can walk through the Seminary (Christian training center) right nearby on the way there or back.

For some down-home comforts or just good vibes I’d definitely go to Barton’s Bagels, Bubbas  or Hildas or the Easy Street Cafe or the Half Day cafe (some of these places may have closed by now), Comforts, Woodlands in Kentfield/Ross, the Good Earth grocery store / cafe in Fairfax, maybe Marin Coffee Roasters or Fairfax coffee roasters. Walking around Ross on the way to Kentfield is pretty nice. Also just going down into any random creek in Fairfax and splashing around is pretty fun.

"If you want to take them up on the Marshall Store idea (which is a great place), you could go Lucas Valley Rd, right onto Nicasio Valley Rd, pass through the town of Nicasio, drive along the reservoir, make a right onto Point Reyes - Petaluma Rd, 4 miles down the road after you pass the Cheese Factory take a left onto Hicks Valley Rd., left onto Marshall - Petaluma Rd which will dump you out onto Hwy 1 on the North end of Marshall.  Turn left and about a mile down the road on the bay side is the Marshall Store.

This will bring you through redwoods in Lucas Valley, past the Nicasio reservoir (not empty!!!), through a lot of open space and ranchland, and then the view of the bay and Point Reyes across is really nice as you crest the highest point of the Marshall - Petaluma Rd. and travel downhill towards Hwy 1.

"1 is great, a couple things to note: 

* Generally it won't be too foggy if it's raining, but if it is foggy it's not worth the drive, especially if you're a timid driver (can get sketchy out there in fog). 
* if it rains hard enough, and you're out early enough (e.g. dawn), there'll often be debris (rocks) on the road. Probably won't flood but some areas may have large puddles and the road is narrow. 
* there's a couple corners there that you can easily lose it when it's raining. Drive cautiously. 
* I see someone else already mentioned it but I'll repeat it. As a courtesy, if someone is behind you and no-one is in front of you, pull over at the soonest safe opportunity (they're almost certainly driving faster than you are if they come up behind you). Yes, even if it's just one car. (if there's multiple, when you pull over you let \_everyone\_ by, no pulling back in until it's clear) You can drive the speed you prefer and they can drive the speed they prefer. Everyone's happy.

"Suggested itinerary:

Pickup oysters from Tomales bay oyster company (ideally bring a cooler and and shucking equipment, but they also sell it there)

Drive back down to cowgirl creamery in Point Reyes Station — buy cheese and bread and wine/beer and have a magical oyster/cheese/bread lunch at the picnic tables there.

Then get soft serve from Palace Market a block away and a coffee from Toby’s and walk around town for a bit. Look at some of the art galleries, bookstores, maybe the farmers market if it’s the right day. 

Then go for a swim at Whitehouse pool or Shell beach if it’s warm enough (or find a hike if it’s not warm)

Then drive out to the tip of Point Reyes national seashore for sunset, stopping at the Point Reyes Shipwreck and the Cypress Tree Tunnel along the way. 

Grab dinner at saltwater oyster depot on the way back (make reservations ahead of time).

">	Where should I visit?

(im going to answer in a new comment so people can chime in)

If you want old marin hippie culture, the last part of that still standing is in Fairfax, which other people in this thread have mentioned. If you go to the Wu Wei Tea Temple there, youll get a taste (and smell) of the hippies. I used to work at Mana Bowls up the road, which is a popular spot (has a 50/50 chance of being open on any given day)

The Sweetwater in Mill Valley is a venue that Bob Weir still plays at a lot and is a super old part of Marin culture, a lot of legends have been through there.

Larkspur has the best downtown imo, but I’m biased.

The Silver Peso in Larkspur and the 2am Club in Mill Valley are both going to have some seasoned marin-ites. Both are dive bars.

"1. White. Not any particular nationality, but just white.
2. Not really a lot of personality at all. Lots of old people or families with kids. I will say there are a lot of comments here about people picking up their kids in maserati's which isn't true. It's much less flashy. Many many people drive teslas, but very rich people wear khakis, golf outfits, basic boring right white people clothes. But it is not a flashy place. There are lots of 60's ranch houses that are $4M. 
3. Politically I would guess most residents are super conservative republicans with a few rich democrats thrown in for good measure. I'm not sure this has really evolved from the 60's. The most political you will see is that they tend to be the ones who host $20k per plate fundraisers for candidates.
4. There are no young people in town (past high school age)  
  

5. Downtown is a the elementary school, bike shop, 2 fancy restuarants, a hair salon, and a children's clothing shop. And the post office. There is no mail delivery in Ross so everyone comes down to Ross Common to pick up their mail.

"Ok so I’ve done some more research and in 1969, the median family income was $17,211 (or $133,052 in 2022 money), a bit more than the median income of all of Marin county at the time ($13,935 or $107,724). The median family income in 2019 was $244,500.

So, I think, based on this and another comment I saw, Ross used to be a lot more mixed, with more middle class families. I’m still looking into those other towns, and ultimately know I’m going to have to visit Marin County to really decide, but the fact that Ross seems to have been a more middle class working town with a good school fits what I’m looking for for the novel.

So, I have a vague idea of how the town looks and feels, which is good enough for the early stages of my first draft, but obviously not nearly enough yet.

Im writing about Ross because the story is about a few hippies who want to create something bold and new (I can’t tell you what it is, because I haven’t finished the book and am keeping a tight seal on it). Ross is a small, “boring” town (I don’t mean that in a negative way, I’m from a boring suburb in MA), and contrasts and also fits the characters to some degree. 

Also, Marin County is very famous in terms of classic rock history and was once a haven for beatniks, hippies, and other counterculture types.

Ross is a wealthy enclave for business types.  There's a lot of old money there too.  Gavin Newson lives there.  The kids of the wealthy parents are usually nice rich kids.  They are liberal.  Most have to really screw up (drugs, dui's, etc.) for daddy to not help them out through college, and afterwards.  Gavin would probally be homeless if not for than caring family.  Yes--I went to school with the guy.  He screw up a lot, and the family, along with the Getty's were always there with lawyers, and business finances.

The police department is basically a security force for the wealthy residents.  You will get pulled over for no reason if you drive through Ross in an older car after 11 pm.

Five bucks! 5 bucks because I couldn't be all ""uh, sorry"". Looking back on it I guess of course he was gonna get a gallon, that's the smallest real unit of gas you can get, so really it was my failure to translate his request from ""can I have some gas"" to ""can I have $5"", so that one's on me ...

"Don’t get this comment or why it’s upvoted. 

RSL is married to a Coastie. She’s not married to anyone connected to RBRA, state, etc. Satellite photos also show how much the junk ground tackle is destroying the bottom of the bay and the eelgrass beds.

The bay inventory of boats has been included in just about every RBRA meeting harbormaster report for years, including by the previous harbormaster BP, who was on the take and didn’t enforce anything. With the number of boats still remaining (~80-90?), the argument doesn’t even make sense — they can’t both be lying about inventory and on a rampage taking boats. There wouldn’t be any boats left if there were always 100 and CH and JM cleared 100. 

And yachts with huge anchors aren’t anchoring in the same places because it’s too shallow there. They’re usually out past Sausalito Point.

And Sausalito withdrew from the RBRA years ago, so they’re not part of the eelgrass claims or harbormaster complaints you’re talking about here — though it’s prob fair to say this is partly Sausalito’s doing, since the reason for withdrawal was that they wanted exactly this type of enforcement back when RBRA was trying to get a mooring field instead. 

100% agree what’s happening is inhumane and an absolute outrage. It’s like LA cops dropping every “undesired” member of society on Skid Row and then driving away. RBRA’s taking people’s homes and leaving them to join tent encampments in Sausalito — in the middle of a pandemic, when they were prob in the safest environment (separated from each other) to the worst (huddled en masse) — with no solution to help them find housing or get support, and absolutely yes, Sausalito PD is then swooping in to bully and harass and even assault those out there, including media documenting what’s happening.

"Town Idiot, ""Let's get rid of the Anchorouts!  We will pay your ""researcher"" wife to claim the Eel gras is being bothered?  Golly gee we are smart!""

Town idiot, ""Lets inflate the number of homeless on their derelict boats!"".   Another town flunky, ""But don't you think the public can just pull up a satellite photo, and count the number of boats, and they will immediately know we lied about our little sneaky project?""

The moral of the story is Sausalito created a much bigger problem by being slick.  They brought this problem upon themselfs.

Oh yea, they hired a privateer (Some Harbor Master). to act as judge, and jury, and has been abusing his power.  (My hope is he, and the town, are sued.  Oh yea, the Coast Guard should check his blood alcohol level at around 2 pm.)

We have had the same number of anchorouts for years.  Guys in expensive yachts have moored for months in the same spots with those huge anchors, and we're never harassed, but we need to ge ride of the homeless looking Anchor-outs?  Don't believe me?  Pull up satellite photos.

Most cities and  suburbs in America closed up easements like this a long time ago (Urban planners  mostly built these in in the 1950s and 60s.) These easements facilitate crime: home burglaries notably.  They  also serve as loitering sites for gangbangers, vagrants, and other chronic offenders.

"I have been researching replacing windows in my house for a couple years. I should mention that I've read most of the big window threads on Reddit and the info is often dated/maybe slightly biased or sometimes outright wrong. It is also really difficult to find numbers specifically for Marin. Anyhow, hopefully my research will benefit you.  

I have gotten bids from many of the firms focused exclusively on windows (e.g. AAA Windows for Less, Bay Area Window Factory, Save Energy Company). I have also worked directly with Golden State Lumber and some local contractors. 

I have around 27 windows in my home. Via the ""window installer"" firms, quotes for full replacement (I didn't always get bids for 100% of the windows, so there's a bit of guess-timation here) were in the 60k range. This is for ""retrofit"" windows -- that is, they keep the current windows in place but take out the glass and slide a sash over the current frames. You will ""lose a little glass"" in this process (i.e., the amount of visible space in your windows will get a little smaller). This was also for cheaper (but still fairly nice) Simonton windows -- in a basic white color. It probably could not be permitted because window sizing in some of my rooms is not large enough to meet egress requirements (and ""retrofit"" windows don't change the size of the opening). 

With the contractor route (admittedly, might be hard to find a contractor willing to install windows for you right now, and contractor bids vary _wildly_), I was looking at around 40 - 50k, BUT: with Milgard fiberglass windows, which allows me to get black windows, AND a fancy trifold patio door, AND with full frame replacement (they will take it down to the studs, so no loss of glass). That figure does _not_ include stucco repair (I'm doing a whole skim-coat on the house, so hard to break out the cost to repair just around windows), and the inevitable engineering that I need because I'm combining/enlarging windows. It does not include permit cost either. I expect my total to wind up around 85k - 90k, but this is going to include all the engineering costs, additional install costs for replacing a few headers, and a full skim-coat on the outside of my house. 

A similar install from the window firms for just windows would probably cost upwards of $100k. With the stucco/engineering, probably more like 150k - 200k -- if they would even do it. 

My wife was really pushing for ""someone who knows windows"" (e.g. a windows specialty firm) to do it, but I looked into window replacement/install and it's pretty basic. It's possible that people who install windows all day every day know some tricks about installation but I think that difference is going to come into ""speed of installation"", not ""quality of work"". The other thing you might lose by going the general contractor route is you might have more difficulty if you need to warranty a window. That said, I felt like the cost difference means I could just fully replace 3 - 4 windows if I needed to and still come out ahead. Lastly, window companies will come out literally tomorrow, measure everything, and probably get your job done in a month or less. I expect my window job (which I've been planning for years now) to _hopefully_ finish by next fall if I'm lucky (waiting on engineering right now). I'm also doing a ton of coordination to make it happen (well, not a _ton_, but I've probably poured 12 - 18 hours into research/bids/calls). 

The other thing that set me firmly against the window specialty firms is when I got more details on material costs (by getting a bid for just materials from Golden State). When I asked about adding color to the windows, Golden State said, ""ah, it's about 50% more"". When I asked the window companies, every single one said ""ah, also about 50% more"". However, those window companies were putting that 50% surcharge _on the total cost_. That is, I would pay 50% more in materials AND 50% more in labor. So black windows apparently cost 50% more to install. That was when I like ""oh really? yeah, y'all are scammers"". Also, with Golden State, I had the person say ""eh, if you're going to go black, you might as well upgrade to fiberglass windows, it will be about the same cost and they come in black as standard"".  

If you insist on going with a window firm (you want a more ""full service"" experience), I can recommend all of the ones I listed above. They seemed pretty nice, albeit a bit ""sale-sy"". I think I would give the slight edge to Window Factory, had the nicest experience with them and they had the best estimator (he was very nice, obviously knew his stuff, and made some really good suggestions). I'd recommend just getting some bids from local contractors. If you DM me I can share the info of my folks, but honestly I can't vouch for the quality of their window work (because they haven't installed my windows yet). I also don't know if they are available to do jobs any time soon, or if they are interested in doing a window job (I have them doing a bunch of other work, so it's possible that the window job is a ""favor"" to me).    

Re: window type, I think if you go vinyl (basically white windows), Simonton seems fine. I would've been pretty happy to install them if white windows were gonna look nice in our home -- however, we have a fairly modern looking house with original aluminum windows (nice looking but single-pane), and the white windows would've probably looked kind of janky. The Milgard fiberglass windows are clearly a step up, so I can definitely recommend those. 

Two things I would warn you away from is: 1) bids from Home Depot. I got one because it was easy I felt like it would give me a baseline price and it was a total waste of time -- most expensive bid I got plus the guy played some ""let me ask: are you ready to do this deal today?"" type sales games. I have also have heard horror stories about Home Depot installers (all subcontractors). 2) I would stay away from Andersen -- they seem like a window specialty firm with the ripoff dial turned to 11 (the windows themselves are supposed to be ok. Apparently tho the Renewal By Andersen windows -- the one the install firm would use, not the ones your contractor could get -- are cheaper, builder grade windows). Anyhow, good luck!

"First and last mile problems. 

 From most houses in Marin you're looking at a 20+ minute walk to get to the closest transit stop which mostly run along the major corridors.  Many of these residences are up skinny streets in the hills which makes the trip ever harder.

Compare this to a large gridded area like the East Bay or San Francisco where you can usually walk a couple blocks from the majority of residences to the closest transit.

It's the hills and valleys that preclude large gridded areas and efficient transit. 

I personally think that the first and last mile problem could be fixed with subsidized on demand shuttles.  It would also help if you could be guaranteed a spot on transit for your bike/ebike.

"If you follow the local news you will see San Rafael has recently been waiving affordable unit mandates that were part of the approved plans for a couple projects that were stalled out due to financial issues.

That proves that building affordable units isn't cheap.

My point is that ""affordable"" housing is just as expensive to build as market rate, and calling it ""affordable"" doesn't make money magically appear to build it.  Someone has to pay for it, and it's not going to be the wealthy.

"No. That’s not my solution. I actually 100% agree with you. However until our communities create the programs for these people —- it is wrong to criminalize people who don’t have a home. 

Further, I’ve actually worked with the homeless and while you are correct that the vast majority have mental illness and drug addiction there are a significant number who just don’t have a home. 

These people work in our community. They serve YOU and they can’t afford a home. 

I’ve been out on the street at night in outreach programs and all over San Rafael you will find pockets of WORKERS camped in nooks and crannies just trying to get a night of sleep so they can go to work tomorrow in a job that most likely provides a service to people like you. 

When I did this work I was absolutely heartened by the team of young adults working with me who were absolutely respectful and dedicated to making sure as many people as possible were helped in the process. 

I also worked with the shelter program and I can tell you, without hesitation that almost all of those people had jobs and were not experiencing significant addiction or mental illness. Just once again they couldn’t afford the $7,000 to $10,000 price of entry to get a rental in this county. 

People do deserve to live in the communities where they work. There is nothing you can say that will justify criminalizing homelessness or dismissing the fact that people spend 90 minutes driving and pay a bridge toll to work at the grocery store for $18 an hour.

Finally, these services to help the mentally ill and addicted people in our community… how do you expect to get these people off the street and into these programs to treat their mental illness if you do not allow housing to be built to shelter them? Bus them out? Because there is very little vacancy in Marin and absolutely no where to house them while they receive much needed services.

"As I said before, I believe that most of the homeless are suffering from severe mental illness, addiction or both.  Rare is the case that a homeless person is someone forced out of a house due to gentrification.  

We already have services that address this, but we may need more.  I also agree with London Breed that if they refuse those services, they need to be forced to accept.  We can’t continue to let people with addiction/mental illness take over our public spaces.  We spend Billions on this issue and the problem gets worse because in many cases addicted people would rather sleep in a park and shoot up than get treatment.   Not only is this terrible for the addicted (more died from OD than Covid) but it greatly impacts the community who wish to live in peace.   

And no, they are not welcome to sleep in my yard, that would be trespassing and I would involve the local police.

"Yes there are many paths to a destination and thanks a lot for your kind attitude. 

I of course feel that Marin is special and while I’m willing to change what it looks like, I’m not willing to sacrifice it for something with no plan. I know that it is difficult to come up with a plan but how many housing organizations and charities are here in the Bay? What exactly are they doing? Why has nobody even proposed anything? 

They seem to do nothing to solve the problem and instead shriek about gentrification. If they actually cared then there would be no homelessness.

 So for those reasons I am skeptical. Maybe if our government was Japan I’d be less hesitant, however I firmly believe in urban cores and walkable/bikeable neighborhoods, but building things left and right with no plan will only make things worse for everyone. If you’ve noticed gridlock in building housing because people want answers, instead of complaining about selfish Marin people, is to put plans and accountability rather than units so that people know what they can do. That is more useful for the common man than random apartments here and there because then we could actually accomplish something. Ofc I still haven’t seen any that are fair and instead they want to build nothing in Oakland and everything in Marin. Oakland should be ground zero for redevelopment and anything on Bart and Caltrain should be next. And all cheap housing should be in an area where all of their needs can be accessed by bike instead of forcing them to buy a car.

"As if a small footprint apartment complex built on the site of an existing decaying structure is going to cause the ruination of everything. Those are the sites being considered. Not cutting down swathes of tree. They are looking at existing developed sites that are past their prime and no longer in serious usage. How many Redwoods are they going to cut down if they build a small apartment complex where a defunct 80 year old church used to stand?

Scare tactics all you want. Pseudo environmentalism. If you cared about the environment you would want to get the tens of thousands of cars that commute INTO Marin daily to work off the road.

Edit: Oh another down vote for the actual truth. The NIMBYs always go directly to cutting down the forests and environmentalism. Yet the truth is that most affordable housing could be built on property that already is in use. Parking lots, buildings that are in poor shape, buildings that have outlived their purpose.

"I agree with almost all of your points, for what it’s worth.  My main and only point of difference is a feeling of obligation to take steps to solve the problems.  What I see almost everywhere in the BA is this attitude - without a perfect plan, without everyone participating, it just isn’t fair so why even try?  It reminds me of peoples arguments against recycling, against taking action against climate change, etc.  “I’m just one person and everyone else is doing worse than me so why should I hold myself to this standard”.  The answer is because it’s important.  The answer is because if individuals don’t start the snowball, it doesn’t get started at all.  

My wife and I live in Tiburon and cherish the land, the quiet, the community.  That said, I don’t think all change is bad and building in density doesn’t have to mean Marin turns into Oakland.  I legitimately think there are respectful and healthy ways to change and address the infrastructure issues along the way (because we all know they won’t be addressed until it’s forced).

"But the thing is that it will inevitably only benefit a few people unless there is a central plan on how many units are being built across the region as a whole. If not then the housing will go to a) some very few lucky people or b) someone rich enough to afford it. 

The Bay Area is one unit pretty much so there is no plan in place. How many units does this region need? There needs to be a proper analysis so we are not running around like headless chickens. 

Furthermore while I do agree that more apartments being built in Marin especially around the downtowns, there is no need to make it seem like people here are snobby and arrogant. It’s just that nobody wants to see the unique culture of Marin ruined for no reason because people didn’t plan properly. 

I encourage you to appreciate and enjoy the open space we’re so used to having, because it is extremely precious and we have taken a lot of hits just to have it. 

To be honest it seems that Marin shouldn’t be solving problems that other people caused. Since when is it Marins fault that all these tech companies opened in SF and SJ? Why is it that they get to refuse any kind of home building in their ALREADY built up areas while we are blamed for their problems? By not building housing as close as possible to jobs you are enabling the same kind of nonsense that has ruined pretty much every major city in America.

In my opinion every city in the state needs to be penalized based on the jobs they are making money from vs the housing they refuse to build. Perhaps tie income in as well so lower income areas can have more apartments and ergo housing affordability instead of begging the government for affordable housing. Marin is high income and low job so there is no need to live if you can’t afford it. Of course you can live 20 minutes away in Richmond for like 1/5th the price and still enjoy everything the county has to offer minus all the snobby bs. 

I think prop 13 also hurts because then a bunch of people will just never sell their land. 

Honestly if all of these topics are addressed then there will be housing affordability. But building housing here when there is
-no university
-no major corporations 
-no public transit and an extremely expensive geographic environment to build one
-nothing new that has been built in the last 40-50 years 

Is not actually fixing any problems, it’s just making existing problems much worse and trying to put band aids on things. The thing is that nobody talks about this.

"Sorry but I don’t find it logical that because I am against high density housing in Marin that I’m a “racist”. I think you are the racist because you are assuming people of color are too stupid to game the system. 

 Yes it does hurt poor people, so it is classist. But so does forcing them to purchase a car and drive around Marin. So there is no logical reason to build affordable housing here when there are so many other candidates close by such as Richmond, SF or Santa Rosa. 

Furthermore I appreciate the people that come work in Marin and they should be paid higher wages to come here for work but nobody is forcing anyone to work here. They work here because they like it, and there are plenty of other opportunities in the Bay Area for them. In fact if they left then it would create worker scarcity and force wages to go upward. But despite the lack of affordability they still continue to work here because they are drawn to the area.  Furthermore because they are in demand they are able to command higher wages. That would not be a reality if there was suddenly thousands of other people competing for jobs. 

Idk what it is but the environmental crowd are incorrect in their push for car heavy development, but they are correct for insisting that more development will not do anything except benefit a few people. There will never be enough space here for the entire Bay Area and it’s futile to try.

"You can't really have affordable housing without increasing supply or having a very long lottery system + wait for the few affordable units. So a teacher in Marin might have to wait for many years to get one of those few affordable homes (if you don't want to add 4 story apartments).

I think rather than pretending to like affordable housing (like the sign in the photo), I'd like to see more signs that say 'We're full. Don't move to Marin. We want to be able to drive everywhere (vs. letting Bart in) while also living in single family detached homes'. But yeah, don't pretend to care about things like reducing carbon footprint (which we know density helps with) or supporting affordable housing. That's the disingenuous part to me.

"Do not call yourself an environmentalist if you are oppose building affordable housing in Marin. 

What you are is a hypocrite if you do. Almost 100% of the people who work in Marin can’t afford to live here. So they commute in from distances 10, 20, 30 even 50 miles away. 

Do not say you aren’t a racist or that you support BLM if you oppose affordable housing in Marin because a large number of people commuting into Marin to work are people of color. 

I’m talking about your cashier at the grocery store, the manager at the restaurant (and all the staff), your child’s teacher, your respiratory therapist at the hospital, your banker, your mechanic, your nanny, your administrative staff at the company you own in San Rafael. Many times even your first responders can’t afford to live here. 

So if you protest affordable housing in Marin, know this: You are making it impossible for the people who make your entire existence possible to be your neighbor. 

I once listened to a rabid angry crowd in the park screaming their opposition to a housing proposal in the neighborhood. They screamed in the microphone calling themselves “eco-warriors” in the fight against new housing in Marin. 

Right Eco-warrior. You care so much about the environment that you don’t care about 20,000 or so cars driving into Marin to be at your beck and call daily.

"You’re making quite a lot of assumptions, but that’s ok.  

Firstly, I’d like you to know that I live a five-minute walk from the shantytown that’s recently taken up residence under the 101 near the bus station.  It’s an eyesore, but I’m glad that the people who live there aren’t at risk of being swept.  It’s not like that space was being used for anything better anyway.  In the three years I’ve lived here in this neighborhood, nothing has changed with the crime rate.  I *did* recently watch my neighbor’s catalytic converter get swiped, but the people who did that don’t live in the shantytown and has more to do with living next to the freeway.

I’ve never owned a home, nor have my parents, and I don’t see it in my future as someone who’s approaching middle age and in the culinary industry.  My partner needed to be closer to the city, so we moved down here from Sonoma County.  The price of rent down here makes me want to barf, but he can afford it, so this is where I live, even though it wouldn’t be in my own budget.  I scan Craigslist for better deals and there’s just *nothing* affordable for my own income.  We’ll be going back to Sonoma County in the future.

Being homeless isn’t a crime.  People living outside do drugs to stay awake so they don’t get taken advantage of by the other people doing drugs and staying awake, and then you get really strung out, fucked up people who’re literally just trying to survive because they can’t afford to get a solid four walls around themselves.  The fucked up part is that there’s no options.  

If you’re paying 90% of your income to rent, then you’re not that far off from that lifestyle yourself.  Wouldn’t you rather rent something more in your price range so you’re not financially doggy-paddling through life??

"Not entirely true upon your part.

His claims of the drug use was a derogatory stereotype but the facts that he made  about the $ are true and substantiated by the residents upon the floaters.

What both sides fail to realize is that neither side has to live in Marin, both are doing it as they can afford. One is doing it legally and according to the laws, one is doing it illegally.

The cast outs represent a hazard to fellow boaters, a hazard to the aquatic environment and so one. If the cast outs would just move once every 72 hrs then they would not have a problem. If the cast outs would more responsibility rent a slip at the spinnaker marina they would remove the fear of the law, and lastly if they were to move to an area which they can afford then a lot off their problems would disappear too.

"OK, here's some other thoughts: 

> There is basically no inventory right now around here or in Marin given the seasonality. I switched to Zillow sold and poked around a bit and the gaps were nuts. 

Generally kicks up in Feb, as you likely know, but a _lot_ of folks have been looking in Marin given the pandemic realities. 

> E.g. pretty basic 3/2 house posted as sold in 2021 near Terra Linda at $1.3m but Zillow estimate was $2m. 

This seems ""right"" in that (speculation ahead! :) ) Zillow probably over-relies on something like per sq ft price medians to guess-timate housing prices. This kind of thing is probably workable when you have relatively recently built-out subdivisions where things are largely in the same condition, but in Marin you've got ... totally unkempt shacks next to multi-million dollar new builds. I would guess that the house you're looking at which sold at 1.3 needs updating or something else to actually realize a 2M price.

 >There is a section on the map labeled Greenbrae that's probably the furthest south for us.

Ok, that's helpful to narrow things down, and a pretty good dividing line given your weather requirements. Greenbrae/Ross/Kentfield are extremely expensive and have great schools. Fairfax and San Anselmo also have great schools, are somewhat less expensive but still up there. Definitely worth spending time in the San Anselmo and Fairfax downtowns while you're here. As others have mentioned, the traffic to/from there is a mess, but since you are WFH maybe not a huge deal. San Anselmo can vary WIDELY in pricing, lots of very expensive homes and some cheaper ones. They both give me the impression of kind of the type of ""village-y"" towns that you would see in the South Bay, except less suburban and no proximate freeway. 

San Rafael has some very nice areas, some more ""urban"" living (like Gerstle Park), some more mountain-style (stuff off of Wolfe Grade), and some solidly suburban (Terra Linda, trivia: largest concentration of Eichler homes). I have heard the school district isn't all that great, which is what kept us away. That said, ""great"" in the Bay Area means 9/10 or 10/10 schools. When I looked back at the schools I attended in Sac, they all scored in the 6 - 7 range, but I have always felt pretty good about the public school education I got. San Rafael, especially Terra Linda, will regularly be about 10 - 15 degrees hotter than Mill Valley/Tam Valley in summer (which I think is what you want). 

North of there is Novato -- I don't know a lot about it, except that it has the Costco that serves basically all of Southern Marin. The downtown is nice, somewhat similar to San Rafael, maybe a little sleepier. There is a kind of interesting suburb called Black Point/Green Point that's off the 37 and looks pretty nice, might be worth looking into (I hear they get more fog than Novato proper). 

Past that you're in Sonoma. If you want to stretch your dollar for housing it's probably worth looking into Petaluma a little, very cute town that reminds me of midtown Sac in many ways. You might also check out Santa Rosa. 

full disclosure: i'm new to Marin, only been here since 2018 and spent very little time here prior to that. lived in NorCal most of my life (born/raised Sac, Bay Area for the rest with a short stint in NYC).

"cool, sounds like we're on the same page re: housing market realities. I have some other suggestions I can drop in then once I get a touch more time. 

re: that San Anselmo house, I would guess the Zillow estimate \_might\_ be accurate? San Anselmo is fairly desirable. The problems with that house tho are 1) directly on SFD (basically the main road everyone traverses) and 2) ""property needs work"" -- usually if they say something like that, it's ""serious"" work, not cosmetic. I'll be honest, I've never seen anyone put that on a listing before. I would ask for the disclosures (just to get a sense of how much work it needs) and then keep an eye on the selling point. =

Also, in the meantime you might be interested in checking out [trustyco.com](https://trustyco.com) \-- they are like a ""social network for real estate"" and are operating in marin (i.e., there's comment threads on ""homes for sale"" that people offer up opinions on, so you can get some local insight -- it's sort of cool, haven't played with it too much yet).",t2_4kmow0hm,wolffartz,0,1642103978.0,0,t1_hsj394j,hsj394j,False,rootException,t3_s1nai5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marin/comments/s1nai5/thinking_of_moving_to_marin_thoughts/,"Thinking of moving to Marin, thoughts?",/r/Marin/comments/s1nai5/thinking_of_moving_to_marin_thoughts/hsj394j/,2,r/Marin,0,2
"Oh, yeah, the same sort of thing is happening around here - low ball the posted ask, bidding wars, no contingencies, etc. We bought our both places like that, fortunately I am pretty comfortable with and expect to do a bunch of work/rework as needed. Remodeled the kitchen in both places. Was mortified to discover that the release was capped on our water heater in this place by the DIY guy who lived here before. Put in heat pumps in both places.

Seattle and especially the east side (Bellevue, Kirkland) are (IMHO) turning into the bay area fast.

I have been aware of the limits of the Zillow estimates vs. more real comps for a while. Will confess to watching Zillow trying to get into home buying based on their algo and then totally f'ing it up with a certain amusement.

There is basically no inventory right now around here or in Marin given the seasonality. I switched to Zillow sold and poked around a bit and the gaps were nuts. E.g. pretty basic 3/2 house posted as sold in 2021 near Terra Linda at $1.3m but Zillow estimate was $2m. I don't even know what to make of that.

There is a section on the map labeled Greenbrae that's probably the furthest south for us.

Many Marin cities use parcel taxes to raise additional income beyond what can be provided by property tax (due to prop 13 limiting tax revenue growth). e.g., using Zillow's calculation, my annual prop tax should be 10k a year.

"Yeah, I hear you, we were in a similar boat re: family proximity. I focused in on Santa Cruz for a bit due to tech jobs (less relevant now) and surfing. Marin meets many of these same criteria (well, surfing not as good, but it is surfable), has better schools, and, well, not to be heartless, but has fewer ""big city"" annoyances (the homeless issues in SC are challenging). 

You might consider Pacifica, which is south of SF, I think it'll be a bit cheaper than SF proper. Schools are OK, but not as well regarded as Marin. 

If you can give up proximity to the coast (like, do an hour+ drive vs. 20 - 30 min) there might be spots around LA that work and are cheaper. 

There are places similar to Marin but less near beaches in the east bay: Orinda, Moraga. Walnut Creek is also not bad and a little cheaper. South Bay probably also worth a look but is going to be priced similarly to the more expensive parts of Marin. 

I would seriously look at Sonoma too, you're going to see cheaper housing but it feels similar. SF isn't that far from Santa Rosa, Petaluma, etc if you're not commuting. 

Kirkland median prices (1.1M) look like they're a little below Southern Marin median prices (starter homes -- small 3/2s -- in Mill Valley/Ross/Larkspur etc are generally running 1.5M+) but Novato is closer in (1.0-ish median).

"Marin, 

Lived here only 10 years. I love it. Loved it during Pandemic as everyone followed the rules and kept us mostly healthier than most of the country I read. 
Amazing hiking, sunsets, great schools. My 11 year old  goes to Hall Middle, great schools here. Summers can be foggy and cloudy. September and October are usually the warmer months I think. Lots of good people and they offer help if asked. The NEXTDOOR APP is so very useful and neighborly. Everyone in the places I’ve lived have been good neighbors. I have found some good rentals for 2 bed because that’s all we need but decent pricing. The government sites say poverty level income for a single white male in Marin is $82,000.  Lots of people make money yet there’s also the ones ( I know) that live here comfortable making much less. Good doctors I think. Great health stores like The Goodearth, Whole Foods if you like them. Many other great grocery stores. Quick to the city and back for a Warriors game. Marin is great for bike riders. My. Tam is beautiful and Stinson beach is a popular destination on beach days.

Therefore it can be hard to discriminate between random noise, which essentially means inaccuracy in judgement, and bias which is the skewing decision in a particular direction.

"Lived here for the majority of my life. In my neighborhood the community is not particularly tight knit, but that could be in part because I live on a hill with spaced out houses. Fairfax is not particularly diverse, if you want a decent level of diversity in Marin you have to go to Novato or San Rafael, not West or South Marin. Housing prices are ridiculous, our valuation has increased by probably 70% in 12 years of living here. If you’re young and on a budget, do not move here. Prices all around are expensive- groceries, restaurants, gas. Also, Marin doesn’t really have a lot of jobs and a vast amount of the population has to commute to other parts of the Bay. The government is predictably left wing, although I believe our town council is the only majority independent in the country (so says Wikipedia, not sure what year they are referencing.) The town is focused on social justice initiatives and recently the council voted unanimously to rename the most prominent and longest road in Marin, despite mixed resident opinion. The population is very left and very democratic. I would guess that it’s easier to find someone that’s gay than Republican, and even harder to find someone willing to admit to being a Republican. One interesting thing is that there’s a ban on chain restaurants on the books. The only chain we have is 7-Eleven. No fast food chains whatsoever. 

Crime is low, although there is a particular emphasis on bike thefts. There was someone shot and killed while hiking a few years back and a car chase through the town at one point, but these incidents are few and far between. Traffic can be pretty annoying, as there are only two main routes to go from Fairfax to neighboring San Anselmo and only one road that spans the whole town. When people flock to the beaches on weekends, it becomes a nightmare. 

Overall, I have enjoyed my time here, although you have to appreciate a small town feel.

"If he's just a dude with an iPhone then why does it show in the footage that the police are walking off with his full size professional videography equipment? If he is not and never was a journalist how do you explain his 20 years of accredited photojournalism experience?

I saw the footage and I would not classify anything in it as ""resisting"" arrest. In one section you claim he is known to be aggressive and then follow that up by including an incident for which there is apparently no evidence, nor have charges been filed. This reads as transparent character assassination not news.

"haha, guess everyone has a different idea in mind when they hear ""cheap"". 

for me, cheap is that you can grab something filling for around $10 or under. I think Sol Food is more in the $15 range for most stuff (same with Boo Koo & Burmatown also mentioned in this thread -- the latter being specifically called out as ""not cheap""). 

Maybe the OP should have specified a dollar amount, but it seems like most ""ethnic"" food that is not ""fine dining"" is probably going to land in this range ($12 - 20 a plate).

"well, ""ethnic"" might be debatable (given that most people mean ""not white people food"" when they say it), but I'll offer up that [Italian Deelite](https://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-delite-novato-2) is the best bang for your buck I've found in Marin (get the fries). 

I've had some luck in San Raf around Bellam, with [Churro Station](https://www.yelp.com/biz/churro-station-san-rafael).  [Taqueria San Jose](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-san-jose-san-francisco) is frequently referenced, and OK in my book but not great (my gold standard here for ""cheap"" and ""good"" is El Burrito Express in the city, Taq San Jose is more like a Taq Cancun). I've also tried and thought reasonably well of [Picante](https://www.yelp.com/biz/picante-taqueria-san-rafael) and [El Torogoz](https://www.yelp.com/biz/taqueria-and-pupuseria-el-torogoz-larkspur) (the latter is in Larkspur and comes with a bit of a premium, so just on the edge of cheap, but it's good). 

I have not found any well priced banh mi's around, tried both [Banh Mi Zone](https://www.yelp.com/biz/banh-mi-zon-san-rafael-3) (near the convention center) and [Banh Mi & Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/banh-mi-and-coffee-san-rafael-3) and was underwhelmed by both -- in terms of price and quality (although I am comparing them to the banh mi I got in Oakland Chinatown circa 2008, so maybe my expectations around price are way out of line.)
