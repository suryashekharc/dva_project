"Its sad, the free carrot comes with the stick of very strictly enforced NSLP/SBP menu planning requirements, and that stuff just isn't ""real food"", so ironically the kids on average will end up more malnourished.  Also most of the ""food"" goes in the trash anyway, so the ""free"" food isn't even free, its just the food in the trash can will be paid by federal income taxes instead of local prop taxes.

The mandated SBP menu pattern is unbelievably un-nutritious, the program essentially only allows sugar cereal and junk food candy bars, real food will no longer be permitted.

The NSLP menu pattern is not quite as bad as the SBP menu pattern, but again its mostly fattening super high sugar stuff.

The good news is its ""free"", but the bad news is its also a ""guaranteed obesity rate increase program"" and ""guaranteed T2 diabetes"" menu plan.  If its been making people sick and fat for a couple decades, obviously the solution is we need much more of it.  Eventually the menu plan will completely decay to a daily can of Mt Dew with a bowl of sugar.

As usual the mandatory guidelines are based on old beliefs that were discredited by medical research decades ago, but now its going to be enforced upon the kids, to their detriment.

Hopefully the kids, at least the kids of higher income parents, can ""brown-bag"" it so they can eat real food instead of ""free"" junk food.",t2_8eurj,V_M,1,1647444267.0,0,t1_i0w7xdg,i0w7xdg,True,jbobmke,t3_tfhnf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waukesha/comments/tfhnf4/waukesha_flips_again_administrators_decide_to/,"Waukesha flips again.

"I have, the place was cool before the pandemic, now poor Dave looks like he is overwelmed. He changed his store hours to only weekends and the place gets raided constantly when new stuff releases, fridays is like line up day, and he has boxes of cards just scattered everywhere. Those are the negatives. But let me tell you, Dave is a GOOD GUY! he is as friendly as he can be but with a line of customers he cant really do much. He gave me a free pack just because it was my birthday.

The guys nice and I even considered offering to volunteer to help him so he could get back on track but i realize that with a card buisness like he is running, you really cant trust random people with your product.

I was hoping he would go back to live pokemon tournaments but the dude is too busy and i moved out of waukesha about 6 months ago so now im looking for a good card shop in my new area.

there is a card store in brookfield on bluemound right next to best buy. they are wayyy more ""high class/corpoartion"" feeling compared to Daves small store. The down side about these guys is they dont take preorders (when i was there) and they only get a few boxes of the new sets. im convinced they are just reselling online and local customers are getting screwed so i stay away from that place unless i want some magic cards, they only have a small shelf for pokemon, the store is like 95% tabel top games.",t2_itxu6grc,1millShenMain,0,1645743101.0,0,t1_hyb0k2w,hyb0k2w,False,[deleted],t3_t005bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waukesha/comments/t005bs/anyone_know_of_any_good_trading_card_stores/,Anyone know of any good trading card stores around the Waukesha area that’ll have Pokémon cards?,/r/Waukesha/comments/t005bs/anyone_know_of_any_good_trading_card_stores/hyb0k2w/,1,r/Waukesha,0,1

"Westwood was a lovely facility, although expensive, and it was worth every penny, but it became super devout and hyper authoritarian and unbearably self righteous, in contrast the Y preached heavily about ""be kind and respectful of other's health and health decisions"" but was not super authoritarian, aside from precisely one rant filled hate email they sent to every customer early on, and has been for all practical purposes post-covid for far more than a year.  There's a heavy iron gym in the former DMV building and I loved it and the owner is a nice guy, but my wife was/is more into cardio and cardio classes and for various logistical reasons we have to work out together so we couldn't go there, great place to lift if you don't need a pool.  Gold's was nice, if you could find a place to park LOL, but that place closed like a decade ago and AFAIK is still an empty storefront.  

Waukesha is FULL of empty storefronts which is why they keep building more, or something like that.

There's sort of a self selection thing going on, kind of like the local grocery store situation where everyone's very devout at this one store to this day, and nobody has worn a mask in a long time at this other store.  Hardware stores are like that too, LOL.

I've been a gym rat for a couple decades and across maybe a dozen gyms across the country over my lifetime, the clientele of a gym at 6am will be different than 9am vs 3pm vs 6pm, so someone online might love or hate a gym at 9am but have the opposite opinion if you visit at 6pm.  Also the clientele in the weight room will be totally different than the clients in the water-zumba class so if you love or hate one its not going to matter if you're in the other room.  Its like asking the internet which cell phone company has the best service in Wisconsin and hearing reports about poor service in Montana and trying to make a decision based on that info.

AFAIK Westwood is the only open-plan open-concept gym in the area where its like a giant open warehouse and light and airy.  Every other gym in the area AFAIK is little offices and little rooms and long walks between them.  The Y is certainly like that, its a ten minute walk up and down five flights of stairs to go from weights to the walking track whereas at westwood the freeweights are literally six inches away from the walking track.  So whichever you prefer...

The Y has the best family deal where my kids are $5 a piece, I don't think anything about my kids has ever been only $5 per kid in their entire lives except the Y.  There are other gyms where they give off the impression of immense generosity if they let your wife join for $10 off full price, there is no common discount.  It still blows my mind that the Y is $5 per kid; literally nothing about those kids for their entire lives has been only $5 per kid other than the Y.  Best deal in town if you like the Y.

(edited to note, my kids are now older and I'm not sure if the price per kid is still $5, but whatever it is now I bet its still cheap)

"Lifetime Fitness for my wife and daycare for two kids costs me just under $250/month. Multiple pools and hot tubs. Locker rooms additionally have dry and steam saunas. There’s an outdoor resort-like area with more pools, a decently sized water slide and an outdoor hot tub. Those are the ones you can see from the freeway. Very clean facility.

Daycare doesn’t need any advance notice if they are 12mos or older. Under 12months (or until they are particularly mobile) requires a reservation block, but they’ll even give your kid their bottle if you bring it. Older kids have structured activities if they’re into that.

Overall, it’s pricy. If we didn’t have kids, the membership price would absolutely not be worth it. But with the incredibly low daycare price, it actually becomes a very decent deal. However, my kids have gotten so many ear infections that they needed ear tubes, but I think something like that is unavoidable at any daycare. That could also be unrelated, but it is what it is.

"Hey I'm opposite!

I grew up in Pewaukee (""Town of Lisbon"" to be precise), and now live in Las Vegas.  Since 1997.  I graduated from Hartland Arrowhead in 1987.

When I grew up, I remember my parents playing bridge - a lot.  Getting involved in bridge/card groups seemed to be the thing.  This would have been late 70's early 80's.

And also, if you guys have kids, Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, and Girl Scouts is much bigger up there than it seems to be down here in Vegas.  I have many great memories of camping out, whitewater rafting, archery, boy scout camp, etc.

Milwaukee Brewers and Milwaukee Bucks games too.

And you're only 2 hours from Chicago.  Tons of stuff there as well.  Although that's obviously not for the winter.  Navy Pier was one of my favorites!  And the two science museums.  The aquarium is a waste of time though.

Outdoor activities are much more common even in the winter, as long as it is not too extreme of a winter.  Ever try cross-country skiing?  It's quite aerobic and will cause you to forget about the cold while you'll lose some pounds.  You'll feel like crud afterwards and very tired but it definitely does help keep weight off and it's a great way to beat the winter blues.  Lots of parks have pre-groomed / pre-made tracks as well.",t2_4g9va,courthouseman,0,1642584055.0,0,t1_htaqgrm,htaqgrm,True,weetziefairie2,t3_s716al,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waukesha/comments/s716al/new_to_waukesha_need_friends/,New to Waukesha - need friends,/r/Waukesha/comments/s716al/new_to_waukesha_need_friends/htaqgrm/,1,r/Waukesha,0,1

"I grew up in Brookfield (Waukesha County) and moved out in 2016. Honestly Waukesha had so many strange characters from my memory lol! Summer is the best time to meet people for sure. You may end up waiting until the warmer months before you get a decent opportunity to meet new folks. 

In winter, we really hunker down and don't do as much. You see your close circle of family and friends. You watch movies. Maybe do a winter activity like ice skate, sled, snowmobile, look at Christmas lights. 

If I were new to Waukesha, here's what I'd do to make friends during the winter:

1. Go to bars. Wisconsinites love their bars! This is unfortunate, as I don't like to drink, but it is what most people enjoy, so it's one of the quickest ways to meet others. 
2. Go to churches or their events. Again, a lot of Wisconsinites are religious, so this is another good way to meet people. The benefit is that these people won't be bonding over alcohol (as in option #1), but there will be a religious element...so it might not work for you if you are an atheist or can't find a church specific to your faith that is local. 
3. Sports. Either go to sports bars and watch the game(s), or go in person to a sporting event. We are huge sports fans here. See if you can get yourself invited to a sports-related party. You will have a lot of fun even if you don't like sports! You can also offer to host a sports party, and that will certainly attract some people!
4. Get a dog. You will attract other dog owners, and it will give you reason to talk to your neighbors. Honestly 99% of my parents' friends are because of their dog. Lol.
5. Offer something to your neighbors. You could mail out something or leave it on their doorstep that states who you are and what you offer (snow shoveling, lawn mowing, babysitting, house sitting, dog sitting, etc). My mom dog sits for several people in the neighborhood.
6. Join the YMCA. I met lifelong friends there. You could honestly join any local fitness club and have similar results. 
7. Hop on social media and follow a ton of local pages. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter I would think. Follow local restaurants and event venues and pages for the city, for example. Your feed will be filled with local things to do. I literally just saw one for Waukesha on Instagram - the city of Waukesha posted about a January event they held recently. 
8. Hit up a Waukesha visitor's center, or the library. Maybe even city hall. I'm sure there would be fliers up for local stuff to do, or you could ask someone who works there where to find that information. This is something I do when I go to Door County.
9. Volunteer or work part time. Google ""volunteer Waukesha"" or something of that nature and find opportunities. Animal shelters are a great one, as are soup kitchens. Maybe even senior or veteran's centers. As far as working part time, my friends who worked for breweries or bars made the most friends. I also made friends when I volunteered for political campaigns. Weird one, I know, but it did work! I volunteered as an election observer on election day too and met tons of cool people.
10. Take a little class at WCTC. My mom took a ton of continuing education classes like cooking and met lots of friends. I know Milwaukee puts out a rec catalog of classes you can take, and I wonder if you could take these or Waukesha would do something similar. I'm an adult, and I took some classes at UW Waukesha. I have some new pals now as a result!
11. Take up mall walking. There's Brookfield Mall, which isn't far from you, and you could certainly meet new people there or at any of the other area malls. 
12. Visit coffee shops. Same as bars, except people can be a little less friendly. So it's lower on the list because you might have mixed results. 
13. Start a new hobby. I did book clubs and knitting circles. Yarn shops and book shops or libraries will host these. Sewing and crocheting and painting are other good ones. Sometimes pottery too. Another one is signing up for ice skating classes or just hanging out at a local ice rink. I've met friends this way. Cooking is another one - lots of cooking classes around. 
14. Sign up for a ""walk"". I did Sarah's Stride in year's past, for example. Many of these are in warmer months, but not all. There's the Polar Bear Plunge which is similar to ""a walk"" except it's in winter and involves going in cold water lol, but I forget which month it's in. 
15. Start planning for summer!! Look up events and things to do for the warmer months because that really is the best time to meet new folks!!

You can always DM me. I am from the area and still visit often. Happy to help in any way I can. Hope your life is filled with new pals real soon!",t2_o4j11r5,autumn-autumn,0,1642556098.0,0,t1_ht9cl85,ht9cl85,True,weetziefairie2,t3_s716al,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waukesha/comments/s716al/new_to_waukesha_need_friends/,New to Waukesha - need friends,/r/Waukesha/comments/s716al/new_to_waukesha_need_friends/ht9cl85/,6,r/Waukesha,0,6

"There really is a lot to do in the whole metro area plus out to Oconomowoc and Pewaukee.  For further trips, there is Cave of the Mounds.  Door County where Green Bay is located has a ridiculous amount of scenic walks, wineries, etc. If you have little kids, Bay Beach in Green Bay has a bunch of old amusement rides that only cost a quarter.  I'm not sure the conversion rate, but way less than a looney.  

Wisconsin Dells is a massive water park and tourist trap in summer.  Baraboo has the Circus Museum.  Milwaukee has a great zoo with new elephant and hippo areas.  You get right up to the glass to the outdoor pool where Happy spends all his time except to get out to poo which little kids love.  Plus you can feed giraffes too.  The Milwaukee art museum is really good for a city our size.  The lake front is a great place to spend time.

Yes, there is negative stuff as well. But overall, it's a nice place to live with a lot to do.

"No, I think that area isn't bad.  It's north of the airport so you might get air traffic noise. Not sure how much.  

You are close to Woodman's which has the best selection and the best prices outside of Aldi for food. Their produce isn't the greatest and I think someone in their storage area hates bananas because my bananas from Woodman's always bruise more than from any other grocer in the area.

Kopps and Oscar's frozen custard are not that far away too. A definite must try unless you are lactose intolerant.  www.kopps.com for their flavor forecast.  They always have vanilla and chocolate plus two other daily special flavors.

Want to hike?  Their are trails in the area. Their is also the Ice Age trail which you can Google to find various points with parking. Retzer nature center also has nice walking paths in Waukesha.

Want more butcher cut meats?  Roberts Meats on Sunset Drive in Waukesha is the place to go.  They have tons of flavors of bratwurst which is a key part of the Wisconsin diet including several chicken based versions for the impression of eating healthier.

Like baseball?  We have the Milwaukee Brewers MLB team. Hockey? We have the Milwaukee Admirals minor league team.  They are good and at a reasonable cost.

Concerts?  Check out the Riverside and Pabst theaters. They bring in a ton of artists from many different genres.  Not a bad seat in either theater.  I've seen major acts at both and just great places to enjoy music.

Several lakes in the area if you like to kayak or paddle board. 

Like custom chocolates?  Allo chocolate in downtown Waukesha is a great stop. Plus walking around the downtown area can be fun.  There is a good farmers market in downtown Waukesha every Saturday when it's not winter.

Oh, you will need GPS on phone or in your car.  There is exactly zero logic to the streets in Waukesha.  It's like they just paved paths made by drunken goats and that's how the streets were laid out.  I forgot my map of where I was going in the first year I was here. It was before GPS on phones.  I figured to go by my instincts.  20 minutes later I went through a 5 way intersection again.  Yeah, makes confusion corner in Winnipeg look like a cake walk.  No seriously, it's that bad.

"I'd argue those are just human characteristics, not Democratic or Liberal, but that's a different conversation.

The original comment i was pushing back against is that the city is super liberal and therefore they're lying about Darrell Brooks. Which is a stupid comment, especially to make while the whole community is still trying to process what happened that day.

An ineffectual, insipid democrat party, propped up puppet managed that.  If the democrat party had ran a real candidate, the outcome would have been more in their favor.

"Lol, called it.

Shawn Reilly has been mayor since 2014. He was a Republican until January 7th of this year ([edit to add context](https://patch.com/wisconsin/waukesha/waukesha-mayor-ashamed-being-member-republican-party), he is \*not\* a Democrat). Your comment about him (assuming he's the 'non-liberal mayor that snuck in previously') makes no sense. If you're referring to Scrima, he's a trump supporter. Last Dem mayor was voted out in 2010.

The Republican party headquarters is only a little further away, at 2 miles. Your argument is that because the Dems have a little better real estate, the city identifies that way? That's a little weak.

Lastly, a quick glance at election results shows a Republican majority in multiple races last year - [https://patch.com/wisconsin/waukesha/2020-election-voter-breakdown-waukesha](https://patch.com/wisconsin/waukesha/2020-election-voter-breakdown-waukesha).

If you want to argue that the area is split somewhat evenly and leans a little republican, I could go with that. But calling it a Democratic stronghold, \*especially\* with the context as to some conspiracy BS about the christmas parade tragedy, that's nuts.

"Enrollment is down. In 2012 they peaked at 13,143 resident pupils. Pre-COVID they were falling steeply and have fallen to under 11,500 resident pupils. Not sure what the full explanation leading up to COVID, but possibly a combination of private school enrollment increasing, more home schooling, so on, such forth.

From the Board Agenda:

&#x200B;

>Agenda Item Details  
>  
>Meeting Dec 06, 2021 - Finance & Facilities Committee Category Discussion/Information Items Subject 2022-2023 Budget Planning Type Information  
>  
>Recently we talked about a roughly $3.0 million annual structural deficit that SDW has used as a guide for our budget deliberations.  This number was based on the general belief that revenue would be flat to a slight increase and expenses would likely grow at around 2.5%.  These trend lines have held true for several years.  
>  
>Now let’s look specifically at 2022/23.  
>  
>Revenue Limit Authority:  
>  
>No per pupil increase in revenue limit authority or per pupil aid in either year of the Biennial State Budget (22/23 is the second year of the State Budget)  
>  
>Continued loss of resident enrollment at a projected rate of 1.16% per year (this is projected for the next several years)  
>  
>Multiple years of declining resident enrollment has SDW looking at a loss of Revenue Limit Authority (compared to 2021/22) in the amount of $3.4 million.  
>  
>Staff Wage Adjustments:  
>  
>Over the last decade the Consumer Price Index (CPI) has been the benchmark that has guided our discussions on staff wage adjustments.  This is primarily due to state law related to negotiations with represented employee groups.  Over the last six years, the average CPI increase has been 2.3%.  As we have discussed previously, there is going to come a time when CPI is going to significantly increase, and we would have to discuss next steps in developing a budget around that kind of increase.  
>  
>Current estimates for the CPI rate that determines the most you can offer in “Base Wages” for 2022/23 staff wage discussions is coming in at 4.5% - 5.0%.  The state will finalize this number in January 2022.  
>  
>Two major items in our budget moving significantly and in opposite directions: SDW is looking at the most significant loss of revenue authority and the highest, potential, increases in staffing costs since 2011.  
>

" It's crazy how people are saying ""not much to talk about with this massacre"" ""nothing out of the norm with this killer"". I've been looking on medias Twitter accounts, it's still about the Arbery trial, ""racist white men kill black man"" ""Rittenhouse, racist shooter"". But this story ""Tragedy when SUV crashes into parade"". I've always stood against racism because I believe in equality but there's a problem happening right now. People decided to get ""woke"" and stand with minorities. I'm all for that but to then make it a double standard for white people is crazy. It's teaching this narrative that blacks are all victims and the white people are all no good racist that nothing happens to. Like BLM, I thought BLM was trying to stop police brutality and police murderers, have they mentioned one person that isn't black being murdered by police? Why aren't they trying to show ALL the bad police do? Wouldn't that bring even more attention to the cause? Ask a supporter of BLM who was the last white person murdered by cops. No one knows, you have to search for it, it's not about police brutality... It's about police brutality on black people. That's it. We're supposed to be working together but this ain't it.

The fact he had white hate speech on his Facebook and ends up killing 6 white people. The fact that some people say there is no such thing as being black and racist.

"Very well stated.

I can understand where the frustration comes from, since I don't think the national media is doing themselves any favors in the softening language they've used to cover this.  The coverage of the scumbag feeling ""dehumanized"" or his family commenting on the ""failures"" in treating his mental health issues haven't been sympathetic to him, but I can see where it amplifies that feeling.  I can *almost* get where the trolls are coming from when they say stuff like what OPs getting at because of it.

But... like... they caught him.  If there are any voices defending him, hailing him a hero, wanting to bail him out and offer him a job in congress, saying he's a ""fine person""... well they're so few in number and so low in stature that I can only think of ONE guy who said something that the RW media latched onto and that's it.

There is still some controversy here (mostly with regard to the low bail from the MKE DA, and accountability that seems to be lost there), but it's otherwise kind of open and shut.

Even the questionable social media stuff from that scumbag I can understand why it's not being plastered all over:  that is the kind of thing that was JUST deemed inadmissible in a high profile trial (where some of the posts were definitely more applicable to the case), so it only serves the wing-nut outrage media to dig in on it.

But you're so right on that there should be more coverage on trauma counseling.  And the media coverage of today's #Jerseys4Jackson trend is helpful as well.

"I've read some stuff about this and heard some gossip at the gym.  The condo association seems to have plenty of money and the will to spend it, and a nebulous and unclear ""they"" seem to be blaming the city for refusing to approve building permits to repair damage from years ago ""until it was completely surprisingly too late as no one could ever have predicted"".  The claim is the city is/was blaming covid for making it impossible to approve and inspect so the building will just have to fall apart as they wait, although its interesting the association never had any problem hiring contractors when they did have approvals despite covid supposedly shutting everything down, and buildings all over the city seem to have no problem making progress during covid.  So its the usual thing we're seeing where every business and legal problem is blamed on ""covid"".

My guess, is people at the city are cooperating closely, probably illegally, with ""someone important"" whom will soon magically appear and swoop in and redevelop the site at great profit, and the existing condo association and people living there are simply in the way.  We can't be having 'affordable' $100K condos if the site could be redeveloped into $300K condos, etc etc.

"He had an active warrant in Nevada dating back to 2016, well before what happened in MKE, and yes, the MKE courts fucked up, but you were lamenting about Waukesha being so liberal, so I responded about Waukesha. There was also a thread posted to this sub a few minutes ago trashing Waukesha for being liberal and at fault for this because liberal politicians yadda yadda.

I get if people are pissed or angry, but at least get pissed and angry at the right people. And in that case that's not democrats, it's not republicans, it's a guy who's locked up and no matter what is going to rightfully rot in prison for the rest of his life. And it's a systematic failure of the MKE courts, and various districts' attorneys offices leading over the past decade, which are certainly going to be investigated.

And to your other point -- Waukesha County leaned 21% toward Trump over Biden in 2020. I'm not sure what recent trends you're referring to; I only moved away a few years ago so I'm still pretty grounded in the local politics. I don't understand why you're bashing Waukesha or its citizens. Nobody in Waukesha County is at fault for this. *Nobody.*

I don't even know why this is a point of conflict. Yes, the bail policies in MKE need to be investigated and addressed to figure out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again. Why he wasn't flagged when he was arrested in MKE as having another active warrant in another state also needs to be addressed. I haven't seen one single person objecting to that. So I don't even know what you're trying to gaslight. It's the largest mass casualty incident in SE Wisconsin in all of my memory. You're crazy if you don't think there's going to legislation passing as a result of it. It won't happen overnight -- it might take a few a months, but I assure you it's coming.

"On top of this, the majority of coverage was completed pre-Thanksgiving.

There isn’t even a real mystery or controversy as to his motive. We know basically all we need to from his prior criminal record and none of that is in dispute or warranting further  immediate investigative journalism.

The last 20 years of 24 hrs news networks have jaded everyone into thinking round-the-clock push notifications are necessary, but many stories simply don’t need an update every night or every hour on the hour, and the local media outlets aren’t even staffed for that — thankfully, or else they’d be drumming up all kinds of nonsense stories and generating  divisiveness just to fill column inches and programming blocks.

BUT, that said, if any reporters are reading this, please do a story on trauma counseling. My mom was one of the hospital staff responding to this. It was one of the largest mass casualty events ever in the area and there was a lot of chaos about what was happening. She said the younger staff in particular are having a very difficult time processing what they saw that night. This, coming after a marathon last year of COVID triage. There will be many people who were witnesses, victims, family members, friends, first responders, and hospital staff who will neglect to take advantage of counseling out of lack of awareness of their mental health or out of fear of shame, embarrassment, or whatever, and will have this night haunt them for years to come.

"There are a number of posts here that have been removed due to their nature to incite racism against black people. Because the incident is so incredibly tragic, it touches lives all over the state.

"I moved out of Waukesha county and down to FL 5 years ago. Same for a few of my friends and family. We all heard about it pretty quickly through national news.

I just Googled it and there are plenty of stories from today, most of which are centered on the community groups helping support the families.

I think the crux of any lack of media attention is that there wasn't some motivation behind it -- as far as we know it's the purest definition of senseless violence, the guy is in custody and will absolutely be locked up for the rest of his life, he's not on the run, he's not going to get away with it, and there's nothing really new to learn at this point or in the near future. Everyone left, right, or center can line up behind that there's no good reason this guy was allowed on the streets and that he should never spend a day outside of a prison cell ever again.

It's a bail policy fuckup and someone's head will be on a pike for it, but you can only eat up so much primetime news with a mystery that's effectively as solved as it ever will be. Only real thing to cover at this point are the community efforts to help the affected families and any investigation into the bail policies -- which again, as someone ""on the outside"", I've learned about even without having to go look for updates, and any bail policy reform will take several months at a minimum so I wouldn't hold your breath on any meaningful updates on that front for some time.

Aside from that, it's a holiday weekend. Lot of journalists/reporters/investigators are out of the office.

> also, you keep saying as though he was like, targeting running into 

I’m only saying what is in the police report, the full video, and eye witness testimony.  The people politicizing this are somehow trying to paint this as a man who accidentally took a wrong turn. In fact, he pushed his way INTO police barricades in order to get on to this path in the first place.  If he was fleeing the scene of a crime, drugged or no drugged, the simplest and innate response would be to simply drive past the police cars without causing a scene. Turning INTO a police car and pushing past its barricade is somebody who is not intent on fleeing from the police, but somebody looking to cause a confrontation with the police 

I know you are inclined to minimize his political views but we really have two options

1) He decided to drive though this parade randomly simply for “fun”, despite having no indications of having killed before at 39 years old, despite a long history of crime
2) His  political and racial views WERE a factor, and in the heat of the moment and anger flashed from another crime scene, decided to lash out here on this parade

Office Butryn believed the vehicle was going to come to a stop and attempt to make a right hand turn out of the parade route, onto NW Barstow Street.

[Are you talking about 32 year old Heather Heyer who died due to blunt force trauma to the chest when James Alex Fields Jr.  deliberately drove his car into a crowd and hit Heather in the process](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlottesville_car_attack) or are you talking about a different person?

The guy who killed Heather actually got life in prison plus an additional 419 years. He was convicted in a state court for the first-degree murder of 32-year-old Heather Heyer, eight counts of malicious wounding and hit and run. 

The life + 419 years sentence at least sets precedence and gives us an idea of the kind of consequences the Waukesha Christmas Parade Suspect, Darrell Brooks, might recieve.

BTW, Brooks is currently being held on $5 million cash bail. I agree with you that Brooks must be held accountable and he can never be allowed to hurt innocent people again. He is a true menace to society and there are grieving individuals and a heartbroken community because of him. Being held on $5 million cash bail is a strong indicator regarding the severity of his deeds.

"\>Kamala Harris keeps tweeting support for and donating to a bail fund specifically designed to pay the criminal bail of rioters who are arrested for arson, assault, theft, B&E, etc.

The bail fund is not ""specifically designed to pay the criminal bail of rioters who are arrested for arson, assault, theft, B&E, etc."" From a quick search, the only thing that I could find was a singular endorsement from 2020 to the Minnesota Freedom Fund. To which, they describe their mission as: ""The Minnesota Freedom Fund pays criminal bail and immigration bonds for those who cannot otherwise afford to as we seek to end discriminatory, coercive, and oppressive jailing."" Within the context of how you are using this, it must be in light of the George Floyd Protests. From Wikipedia, the organizations role in the matter was: ""The organization said that they would prioritize bail for people who had been detained in connection with the George Floyd protests.\[4\] Most of the people who were arrested during the late May and early June 2020 events in Minneapolis and Saint Paul were for curfew violations, and many were issued citations and quickly released. Around a dozen protesters had their bail posted by the Minnesota Freedom Fund, according its interim director, Greg Lewin.\[8\] Among them, the organization posted the $75,000 bail for a 28-year old Saint Paul man who was charged with attempted second-degree murder for allegedly firing gunshots at Minneapolis police officers who were patrolling East Lake Street during the overnight hours of May 31."" As far as the individual bailed for alleged second degree murder, from how it is worded it would seem he was never convicted, as such I will not further speculate on the matter. Anyways, your claim that the fund is ""specifically designed to pay the criminal bail of rioters who are arrested for arson, assault, theft, B&E, etc"" is demonstrably untrue and takes an incomplete look at the organization.

\>""Then you have Maxine ‘Satan’ Waters telling followers to “make them pay” and most other prominent democrat figures tweeting out support for the riots. ""

I could not find this incident. Additionally, these are just three words that lack A LOT of context. She could have just been going to church? While obviously I am being sarcastic, you are using a three words with no context to support your argument. ""Most other prominent democrat figures tweeting out support for the riots"" contains no further evidence and leans towards speculation. 

\>In the first 4 months of Biden’s presidency, US border patrol detained just over 5000 criminal immigrants (immigrants attempting to cross with illegal firearms/drugs) compared to about 2500 in the whole of 2020.

Surely you are not comparing 2020 numbers to 2021 numbers. You may have forgotten, but there was a global pandemic. I would still be interested to see the data that you were looking at. While the data that I saw did show an increase, it did not reflect the numbers that you presented. Additionally, the 2020 numbers for the data that I viewed were dramatically down from the numbers in 2019. Proving how using the 2020 numbers puts a bias skew into the statistic. It's also hard to accurately compare the two given how different global circumstances are, reasons for immigrations, such as economic uncertainty in there domestic country, have risen dramatically and fueled immigrants looking for new opportunities elsewhere. The point is, there are other variables that you are not considering.

\>Democrats have also tried multiple times to pass legislation to allow convicted felons to vote, and about 2 months ago tried to pass a bill that would make a lot of serious crimes like B&E, theft, and trespassing simply not illegal anymore.

Again, none of this is evidence. This reads like a thesis statement without the body paragraphs. You are introducing ideas that are not later expanded upon.   
Ah yes, THAT legislation. There is no way to respond to you if you are unable to cite the actual legislation. Otherwise these are just empty statements. 

\>Why is every prominent democrat upset about rittenhouse’s acquittal? A convicted child rapist was killed while trying to kill Rittenhouse - why are they supporting the rapist? And why are they supporting the other guy Rittenhouse shot; the guy who has a criminal record as a result of assaulting his own mother and sister?

The way your argument is worded suggests that to think that Rittenhouse is guilty is to condone pedophilia and domestic violence. The way that your argument is worded is nonsensical.

\>The list is endless. Do your research. Democrats love criminals and hate morality. They want the rioting and the looting and the violence. They openly encourage it. They are completely unhinged, demented, and disgustingly corrupt.

"Here I am. Legislation wasn’t the best way to word it; I just don’t know how else. Kamala Harris keeps tweeting support for and donating to a bail fund specifically designed to pay the criminal bail of rioters who are arrested for arson, assault, theft, B&E, etc. Look up Thomas Moseley, who has now been arrested 4 times for illegal possession of 3 handguns, a semi-auto, a Kevlar vest, etc. - none of which he owned legally. He also set fire to a Minneapolis police precinct and was caught in possession of cocaine and mushrooms. The bail fund paid his first bail @ $5k, 2nd bail at $60k, 3rd at $250k, and I’m not sure how much the 4th one was. Peaceful protesting? Setting a police precinct on fire? Bringing Kevlar and 4 illegal firearms? 

Then you have Maxine ‘Satan’ Waters telling followers to “make them pay” and most other prominent democrat figures tweeting out support for the riots. In terms of legislation, the border crisis is far worse now than under trump as a result of opening the border and not vetting anyone - are you aware of the massive spike in crime on this side of the border? In the first 4 months of Biden’s presidency, US border patrol detained just over 5000 criminal immigrants (immigrants attempting to cross with illegal firearms/drugs) compared to about 2500 in the whole of 2020. They’re on track to hit about 15000 for 2021, and Harris, who’s in charge of the border crisis, is taking her time fixing this problem…

Democrats have also tried multiple times to pass legislation to allow convicted felons to vote, and about 2 months ago tried to pass a bill that would make a lot of serious crimes like B&E, theft, and trespassing simply not illegal anymore. 

Why is every prominent democrat upset about rittenhouse’s acquittal? A convicted child rapist was killed while trying to kill Rittenhouse - why are they supporting the rapist? And why are they supporting the other guy Rittenhouse shot; the guy who has a criminal record as a result of assaulting his own mother and sister? 

The list is endless. Do your research. Democrats love criminals and hate morality. They want the rioting and the looting and the violence. They openly encourage it.

"A lot of folks, folks like you based on how you speak/type whatever, are using the ""NEXT"" moniker at the ends of their nonsense and Im starting to think they dont realize that the place that comes from...the person repeating ""NEXT"" was the asshole there...

People killed or injured are victims. While i have no interest in going too deep into the recent Rittenhouse case, not calling those people victims was a direct and deliberate thing done to dehumanize them. Did it effect the results based on the evidence and laws of this state? It shouldnt have but to some Jurors it \*may\* have. But not calling them victims seems to run the line of calling certain people thugs to dehumanize them an make it easier to convict or not.

However, With all that said. Youre comment is running straight into a tangent because that seems to be the way your brain works when presented with something vaguely related to what you dont like

our base comment of saying hell get bail and people kneeling to him isnt even tongue in cheek, its just stupid...but you seem to believe it. The comment in nonsense based on the obvious crimes and yet you didnt make it in jest, you made it based on other situations that are not relevant or related just because youre mad about something else. So of course the other people thought you were a bait laying troll, but youre not. Youre just the asshole type who comes into a conversation to spout nonsense because you actually believe your opinion, as silly as it is, matters, not because you want to actually be involved in the conversation or to add anything to it. You didnt even do it to make them mad or their jimmies rustled like a troll would. you believe it **because** of your other feelings on criminals and black people.

Ex 2: ""He was fleeing the scene of a crime, running from police, just an ignoramus who didn't premeditatedly intend to kill anybody."" This confuses my heart–I know that what he did was abhorrent and must be punished, but he might not be the psychopath that I initially thought he was.
