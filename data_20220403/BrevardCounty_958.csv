"I keep thinking back to this. I didn't notice you're in Miami until after I posted. If you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city, Melbourne is a cute, sleepy town. Prolly a little more woke than the surrounding area. Pretty boring as others have said, it depends on your lifestyle. If you're into outdoors things, plenty to do. There are some arts and culture but a far cry from Miami. I'm a homebody these days so it's fine for me; when I was younger I would've been miserable. 

The racism here seems more old school than in a city. More blatant, and the people here are really, really stupid. I can't emphasize that enough. Like, I have tons of coins because if your total is $15.25 and you're holding a $20, adding a quarter confuses them. I'm not even exaggerating, it just happened again yesterday when I thought the manager of a small shop would figure it out. I don't even try to give exact change anymore. I could go on and on about the stupidity of the locals, they're just uneducated and dumb (not everyone, but by city standards it's backwoods).

I have to add that again, I think Florida is pretty damn racist in general. IMO this area is more racist than average, but we're talking shades of gray. There are some areas in Florida that are so racist I try to talk my light brown friend out of just driving through when she visits (she won't listen). But if she wanted to move here, I'd tell her what I told you but emphasize looking at the area to see if it's a good fit for what she wants. However, if she lives in a pretty racist area in the South so it would be a lateral move. If she were coming from a more progressive state, my advice would be different. 

And it's so hard because I haven't lived in your skin. I admit I'm blind to a lot of micro aggressions. I get a free pass where others don't, and it just comes without me even thinking about it. I'm alarmed that people just blatantly said they won't rent to a young, black couple. Wtf. As others have said, that's illegal. I hope you have documentation, but Florida is a two party consent for recording (meaning you can't stealth record conversations).

Sorry to go on and on. I have a lot of mixed feelings about this. Yeah it's racist but is it more racist than Miami?

"I'm white, lived all over the country, and this area is one of the most overtly racist places I've ever lived (New Orleans was pretty bad too). I guess because of my skin tone, racists feel like they can show their true colors to me and I'll agree with them? 

Had an older couple casually drop the N-bomb during a 5 minute, 'how's the weather' type conversation at the dog park. I don't remember what they were even referring to, I was so shocked, I saw red. Fortunately the person I was with shut them down with class and intelligence, I was about to go off on them in a stupid way.

My fucking Hispanic, immigrant neighbor felt like it was ok to complain to me about how many black people were moving into our area, and said Obama was building apartments just for black people. Wtf. She's old, crazy and religious... I can't stand her for a bunch of reasons, but especially after that. 

Our county sheriff, Wayne Ivey, is racist as fuck, and that bleeds into his sheriff department. He doesn't even try to hide it, and his department has a history of treating black people terribly. He sports a [tattoo](http://www.volusiaexposed.com/brevard/bcso/2021/sheriffivey82021.html) associated with the Oathkeepers. 

Our State House Representative, Randy Fine, is anti BLM and a racist asshole too. Our federal House Representative, Bill Posey, isn't as blatant but participated in birtherism. 

These guys keep getting comfortably voted in for decades, 60+%.

Brevard also has the distinction of being one of the top counties in the USA that had people arrested in connection to Jan 6 (we were number one, then tied, and I'm not sure anymore).

There's a really dark racist history in this area that I'm only learning about, like plantations and the original head of NASA was a Nazi, which attracted other Nazis. As a result, there are a lot of racist KKK-type organizations in the area. You'll see the occasional rebel flag, one idiot likes to drive around with giant ones on his pickup truck. 

I'm only here to be near family. Melbourne is really cute and quaint, the downtown beachside is pretty. It's a little better than the surrounding areas imo.

Obviously I can't say what it's like to live here as a POC. I, and many other people, would welcome you with open arms. I hate writing this because it might dissuade you, but you asked for honesty so there it is. 

I can't imagine it's much worse than SFL, though. I know that when I lived in Orlando the racism seemed much less; but my POC friends had a lot more unfortunate experiences, so I just personally didn't experience it as much.

In our family we are both spanish but one of us is black and the other  brown. It’s funny cause we will take turns asking for services to test out the peoples attitudes and it hasn’t failed 😂😂. Trust me when you move up you will know what I’m talking about.

Also, if you don’t look for it you won’t see it, not saying ppl are ignorant it’s just my observations.

"This is surely a challenge. It is not just the manatees, but they are ravenous. We also have our algae blooms which kill off grass. That's something we can focus on. The fertilizer ban that we have is supposed to help. We are also keeping manatee here artificially in the winter. They used to go up to Cocoa to enjoy the warm water of the FPL power plants cooling units. The manatee would stay here instead of going south like they used to (they rarely came N of Sebastian in the winter in the old days.)  Some of the well meaning but lunatic lefties have sued or are suing FPL to actually WARM the water in those canals to keep the manatee comfortable now that FPL has switched to LNG at that plant and the cooling isn't required.  There are things that we can do.

If you are talking about Crew-4 it has been rescheduled to 4/20:

>@NASA_Johnson 12:45pm March 13, 2022:
NASA's SpaceX #Crew4 mission is now launching no earlier than April 20 at 6:37 a.m. ET. 

The launch will be from LC-39A, which is on the north end of Kennedy Space Center.

I wrote this up for a friend a while back and decided to post it online for people: [Places To Go To Watch A CREWED SpaceX Launch At Kennedy Space Center](https://oldmanpar.wordpress.com/2022/03/31/places-to-go-to-watch-a-crewed-spacex-launch-at-kennedy-space-center/)

**Jetty Park:** views are pretty good, but it is 13 miles to LC-39A from there, and the rocket will be flying NE and away from you.

**Cocoa Beach Pier:** About 15.5 miles from LC-39A. Decent views, but again, you will not see ignition on the launch pad and the rocket will be flying away from you.

Better views:

**Max Brewer Bridge, Titusville**: this is considered a top-class viewpoint. Get there early and park across the street at the park. Walk to the top of the bridge on the south side.  11.75 miles away, with an elevated viewpoint, you will clearly see ignition and liftoff. You will also be able to see the rocket more clearly as it flies away.

**Space View Park, Titusville:**: 12.1 miles away, this is another great viewing area. The park is smaller, with less parking but at 6am there should be little issue getting in and out.  Ignition and liftoff is visible.

**Rotary Park, US1, Titusville:**: 12.1 miles away, and an excellent place to go see the launch.  A bit south of Space View and the Max Brewer Bridge, this park is actually closer to the launch pad and you will be able to see the liftoff. Is on the Indian River and and is an excellent vantage point. There is a small parking lot and road-side parking.

**Kennedy Point Park, US1, Titusville:** 12.25 miles away. More or less the same as Rotary Park but with a little less parking.  Ignition and liftoff is visible.

"We moved here from Central PA last year. We came down and spent a day in each area from north to south (started in Titusville, then Cocoa then Viera, Melbourne, Indialantic and Palm Bay) I'd suggest you do the same if possible. We have friends in both Viera and Melbourne that showed us around.

Titusville was just to run down for us. Cocoa was better but wanted to avoid the the more touristy area of Cocoa Beach when we go to the beach. We liked Melbourne the best for proximity to the ocean and better selection of restaurants. But ultimately we settled in southwest Palm Bay (near Bayside Lakes). We got a lot more house for our money and all of our everyday things (groceries, kids school, Lowe's/Home Depot/Walmart) are all within ten minutes. We do find ourselves venturing 15-20 minutes north to Melbourne or a Palm Bay Rd area for a better restaurant selection but we only eat out once a week or so. The beach is about 25 minutes away because we have to go north to 192 to go across but we only go to over there once a month or so. 

We were just able to get a much larger yard and house and more privacy in Palm Bay (with no HOA) for our budget so we are happy with our decision. We both telework so commute wasn't a concern.

"Amending Brevard County's charter to allow for the recall of school board members may not be as straightforward as supporters would like to believe.

Charter Commission General Counsel Paul Gougelman concluded the recall provision submitted by Brevard Public Defender Blaise Trettis is inconsistent with Florida Law and the state constitution, stating that: “According to a 1971 opinion of the attorney general, it may not be constitutional to provide in a county charter for the recall of a school board member.”

His opinion, offered in a memo sent to committee members as part of the March 22 Charter Review committee meeting, presents the first, and perhaps most damaging, legal hurdle, for those who want it included as part of the Brevard County charter to date.

Thus far, recall elections only apply to locally elected municipal officials such as mayors, those serving on city councils and county commissioners — and may only be justified in specific situations related to malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect, drunkenness, incompetence, an inability to discharge duties, a felony conviction and for moral reasons.
Trettis modeled his plan on already existing state statute but seeks to modify it in two significant ways: expanding potential recall elections to school board members and allowing them to be removed for policy positions they take on issues.

The proposal originated from a decision that Brevard Public School leaders made mandating that students wear masks to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic as students, especially children, returned to the classroom.  
In some sense, this debate is happening throughout the country as polarization deepens from a gulf to a chasm.
That touched off a recall campaign from some in the public, angry that they believed the policy violated the governor’s order.

Trettis first made his proposal at last month’s committee meeting on advice from members of the public — and garnered strong opinions from critics almost immediately.

“When we have school board members making such important decisions about the health and wellbeing of our children, four years is too long to wait and make that change,” Trettis said.

Since then, both supporters and opponents have rallied people to their respective causes, not only at Brevard Public School meetings, but also at the charter review committee.

“It is a dangerous game of retaliation politics that our state seems to be reveling in right now – all because of a loud minority of voters, and in this case, a group’s founder who cannot accept her loss,” said Pam Castellana, head of the Democratic Party in Brevard, back in February.

Committee members then requested answers to questions they had regarding Trettis’ plan, which became the basis for Gougelman’s memo.

After reviewing the matter, Gougelman concluded that introducing a possible recall of school board members violates both the Florida Constitution and Statute Section 100.361. His reasoning, which he admits is complicated, deals with local ordinances and charters that adopt a policy stance on an issue counter to the one the legislature has already decided — a concept called preemption.

What happens when a county charter or local ordinance is potentially inconsistent with state law? In some instances, the state has made its so expressly clear what it intends in certain areas by the laws and regulations it has passed that any attempt to run counter to those intentions is not allowed. This is otherwise known as express preemption. 
In other instances, the state's intention is not explicitly stated in statute or regulation but can be interpreted. This is called implied preemption. Courts have ruled that “the scope of the ‘implied preemption’ should be limited to the specific area where the Legislature has expressed their will to be the sole regulator,” according to Gougelman’s memo.

“Arguably, a conservative reading of the state law on recall suggests that the Legislature intended to preempt the issue of recall in municipalities and charter counties,” he wrote. “Consequently, a county is not permitted to legislate in the area of the area of recall, which would include the recall of school board members.”
He bases his interpretation on the statute governing recall elections, which explicitly states “municipal recall” in the language. That was enough to convince Gougelman that the statute only referred to county and city officials — meaning that allowing for the recall of school board members in the county charter is a matter preempted by the state, and inconsistent with state law.

Gougelman also based his conclusion on a different section within the same statute — the intent.
“It is the intent of the Legislature that the recall procedures provided in this act shall be uniform statewide,” Gougelman’s memo quotes. “Therefore, all municipal charter and special law provisions which are contrary to the provisions of this act are hereby repealed to the extent of this conflict.”

Not surprisingly, Trettis disagreed with Gougelman’s interpretation.
“I wanted to point out that what is not included in the memo is that there are two counties that specifically provide in their charter for the recall of school board members,” Trettis said.
One is the city of Jacksonville, which is in Duval County, and the other is Sarasota County.
Gougelman throughout admits the statute is subject to interpretation, and he is but one person trying to glean the meaning of the rule, its intent, and how it can be applied to Trettis’ proposal.

It is in that ambiguity that became the focus of some of the committee members.
“What a surprise that two attorneys have come up with a different conclusion here,” said committee member Bob White facetiously. “With regards to whether or not one opinion is right or one opinion is wrong, seems to me that is one of the reasons that we are here.”

That did little to assuage the rhetoric of those who attended the meeting, all vigorously arguing for their respective points of view.

Originally, the recall proposal was about the Brevard County School Board's adoption of mask mandate for students and staff, but has now morphed into grievances related to a nationally raging culture war over wider education policies. A recent example is over books that some deem inappropriate for children.
“They are currently distributing sexually explicit content to our children of ages 11 and up,” said Katie Delaney. “Two of the five school board members don’t see an issue with rape, pedophilia, explicit sexual acts being described to our children in Brevard. They should all be removed immediately and held accountable for endangering our children.”
It also touched on transgender issues.

“The other reason is matters such as the transgender policy the public school system here at Brevard County, which allows kindergarten through 12th grade to use the same bathrooms, locker rooms and showers with children of the opposite sex,” Trettis said.

The most combative exchange he had was with Castellana, who claimed he misrepresented the mask mandate policy that school board members approved, which justified his recall proposal.

“The mask policy that was approved by the school board last year was never indefinite,” she said.

The recall proposal will continue to appear at future meetings before it will be voted on by members of the committee.

"Also 29 , with a new baby. I’ve lived here since 2015 and personally I loved it (past tense because now it’s getting too crowded for my liking). If you can work remote then anywhere will be fine- can’t speak to schools yet but for a house anywhere east of I95 will be better for flood zones. 
As for living places this is all personal opinion but: Melbourne and west Melbourne are good, usually very down to earth people , viera can get a little pricey and not worth it with all the cookie cutters . Also the golf carts and amount of drivers on their phone drives me absolutely mad. Anywhere beachside has a mix of laid back and money but usually just nice / chill people. If you have to be in office the drive across the causeway will suck a bit, and keep in mind for hurricanes they evacuate everyone beachside (doesn’t happen every year, only if there is a bad one, but mainland you can hunker down). Palm Bay is hit or miss depending on what area you’re in, so I’d say it highly depends on what you’re looking for in the area you live in. If it’s feasible, I suggest renting a house either Melbourne or beachside so you can get a feel for what you like about the areas and then decide where to buy. Anywhere is nice to raise a family imo, it just depends what your interests are and the schools.

"TLDR - Looking for city life, check out the growing Viera. Looking for surf lifestyle, beachside is a must. 

Personally, the word I'm picking out here is going to be, surf. I would find yourself a home  beachside, specifically between Pineda Causeway (north Satellite) and  Ocean Ave (Melbourne Beach).

IMO beachside is best to raise a family.   
As far as the contaminated areas, that is mostly a 1/2 mile area of what was old Patrick south housing and is now Montecito and homes to be built. [There is a Facebook page dedicated to this topic.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2005699303078736)

Back to the surf word... living beachside surf is minutes away on foot or bike. If your mainland, you'll always be planning your time/traffic for surf checks and beach outings. I don't surf, but I highly enjoy walking to see the sunrise as much as possible. I feel like if I lived over the bridge this would be much less likely a thing for me. Skatepark in Satellite Beach is actually on the border of IHB and SB and has soccer, football, dog park, library. Another park build out happening 1/4 mile at Algonquin sportsplex for IHB. (hopefully we get a pump track)

Crime activity is generally much lower beachside and IHB/Satellite cops are pretty quick to respond. Also a new police station is being built for IHB.

Flooding beachside, depends. I've lived here 30+ years and my house has not been flooded, but I know some parts of Satellite beach flood pretty bad for streets. Ive heard stories of flooded homes in Palm Bay. I assume any houses in the last 10 years and Viera won't have flooding as most newer developments plan and create retention ponds. 

Gators, rule #1 in Florida, expect gators in ANY body of water. Beachside, this may still hold true, but I believe most of the ponds and canal areas we have had been rid of gators awhile back. There are sightings daily on river docks in Satellite. 

River, you mentioned surfing and if you are familiar with the area we also have an active river community. Like surfing, you can paddle board, kayak, boat, jetski, kite surf, fish, etc.

I live in Melbourne. Florida homes are built to drain in the event of heavy rain so flooding is not really an issue. I've lived in South Florida all my life and never had an issue with flooding. Only during hurricane season had I been close to affecting my property but never again. Palm Bay is more affordable but because of the city politcs I stay away from that area. Indialantic and Satellite Beach is nice and you'll be close to the beach but I've heard recently it is very difficult to insure your property. I hear people losing their coverage because insurance companies are leaving in mass. So take that with a grain of salt. Other areas you could look into is Grant or Cocoa Beach but that is more of a commute.

"Hey,

My parents and I moved here in ‘91 and I only briefly left for college back between ‘08 to ‘14, and moved back with my wife when I got a job here. I am an engineer who used to work by the airport and now works at Kennedy Space Center; my wife is a teacher and has worked at a number of the public elementary schools nearby. We currently live in the Suntree/Viera area with a 6 month old. 

I really like where I live and the local amenities. A lot of that deals with the fact that we got very lucky and bought a relatively cheap home before the market shot into space. The schools in this area are pretty good but your mileage may vary depending on where you decide to live. I actually attended Suntree, Longleaf, Johnson, and Eau Gallie growing up here, they all had their pros and cons. Having a wife working in public school, my one major pet peeve is charter and private schools, I’m personally not a fan of them and think they take away from the public schools in the area but that is a different discussion. 

I grew up in Melbourne and have family living in Palm Bay. If you want to work with one of the Defense contractors that are local, your best bet is to live closer to the airport as some are situated nearby. But, if you don’t mind a commute you can live further out. Most defense contractors don’t have very flexible work from home policies. Some might, but because of the classified nature of the work it’s less than likely. 

Flooding depends on your location. We live in a flood zone (technically) but it is stilly highly unlikely based on the flood maps. That being said we still bought flood insurance which is relatively cheap. Speaking of insurance, the market here is a total clusterfuck right now, so if you plan to buy a home you may have to deal with that headache. 

If you have any other questions shoot me a PM and we can talk. Also, if you are looking for work at one of the defense contractors let me know and I can ask some contacts if they are hiring.",t2_cf0fw,NotCanada,0,1648659658.0,0,t1_i2qir5s,i2qir5s,True,Krazul,t3_ts9mdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/321/comments/ts9mdh/looking_for_opinions/,Looking for Opinions,/r/321/comments/ts9mdh/looking_for_opinions/i2qir5s/,18,r/321,0,18

"**Schooling:**

You and your child(ren)'s school experience will depend highly on how motivated you and they are. Starting with middle schools, public schools often have different and varied programs that range from Automotive, Marine Industry, ROTC (for all branches), STEM, AP or IB programs, Nursing, Child Care, to Dental. You can 'apply' for your child to go to a school they are not zoned for - sometimes there are additional requirements you need to meet or waitlists you have to content with so it's not a guarantee but it's an option not many districts in the country give!

Many of these programs often have students earning certifications and college credits while attending regular middle/high school. There's also the option of duel enrollment at EFSC or even FIT. All these options are available for free to every student in Brevard County at no cost to you.

**Areas to Live:**

It depends mostly on your budget but also your needs and wants. If you want a place with a lot of amenities within 5-10 minutes drive you probably want to look at Melbourne or Viera.

If you want to walk to the beach and can sacrifice some amenities and have the budget, obviously beachside.

If you don't want neighbors to have their living room window 8 feet away for your bedroom window, rural Palm Bay, Grant-Valkeria, or even Cocoa might better suit you.",t2_7jaij,heathersaur,0,1648657124.0,0,t1_i2qcbda,i2qcbda,True,Krazul,t3_ts9mdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/321/comments/ts9mdh/looking_for_opinions/,Looking for Opinions,/r/321/comments/ts9mdh/looking_for_opinions/i2qcbda/,9,r/321,0,9

"I see many posts on the internets from people who moved to Florida and then are looking for a job and won't take one because of the low wages here. Comparatively to other places the wages are far lower but the cost of living is lower compared to somewhere like NYC.

There are many scenarios why someone would have moved here without employment such as moving with family for a significant other who got a really good job here, but the ones that really concern me are the people who packed up and left wherever up north and showed up here and then started looking for a job. Everyone is hiring but a lot of people aren't willing to take a job in the service industry for example. I know several small business owners who struggle to find employees, and even more difficulty to find quality employees.

Our cost of living with all of the new people moving here is going up, people who have lived here for a long time are being priced out of their own neighborhoods.

There was a good almost 10 year stall between the 2008 recession and the upswing where developers just weren't building apartments/multifamily homes in the area. So most apartments you see are just that: either really old or really new charging a premium.

But also because of that, there's a lot of houses up for rental that are honestly the same price as apartments. So look at houses too.

"I've stayed in a lot of Comfort Inn Suites and other chain suite hotels that sometimes have multiple contingents of construction crews using it as home base. I assume the company gets a group rate and they are often put on the lower floors, but I'm sure they are paying something to rack rate because I've seen many of these properties completely  booked before the sun goes down and they end up turning away many regular, highway travelers.

My understanding is that if the companies do not exceed the federal per-diem and if they don't just give everyone a flat per-day rate without getting a hotel receipt, it does not count as part of the employees taxable income. That's one of the reasons it will cost a billion dollars to widen 528 from Cocoa to the port and the new aquarium will cost so much. The out of town workers will be allowed around $200 in lodging and living expenses, per day. The price for this will be included in their employer's bid for the job.

"You’re here pushing a petition that cites concerns over:

“-Issues of traffic increases
-Issues of water runoff, sewer, and drainage
-Issues of security and safety for children walking home from RLS Elementary and local houses”

And since basic supply and demand seems to evade you, an increase in the supply of hotel rooms would absorb some of the demand for Airbnb units, decreasing the prices they could charge, making them less profitable and more likely to be converted into long term rentals housing permanent residents.

"I'm not sure of the meaning of your reply. There are many people who work on the Space Center and around the Space Commerce Park short-term for something project-specific. This includes some engineers and scientists, plus out-of-town construction crews. Generally, they all get a hotel allowance and per-diem. If there's a crew, they often stay at the same place.

This hotel will not be as close to KSC as the two by the intersection of NASA Causeway and US 1 (which are probably going to get some of the workers building the new road), but it will be most of the way to the beach without having beach traffic or beach prices.

I'm sure there will also be construction at the port and the new aquarium will likely be built with a significant amount of out-of-town labor. If these workers are not staying at the beach, there is the one motel in MI, the America's Best at Rt 1 and those at the intersection of 520 and I-95. This new hotel will be closer than all of them.

ETA: To be honest, I'm really surprised there is only one motel in MI.

"It's an exit on the Beachline. It is a natural place for highway exit businesses to go.

Going by the blurry map... we looked at a house which borders the property when we moved to the area, but the lots were too small and the houses too tightly packed. I suggest that instead of putting all your eggs into the basket of trying to stop it, you try to get conditions put onto the development, such as maybe a ten foot solid wall (noise barrier) between the hotel and the houses which back up to it and try to put some controls on the lighting, so they are pointed downward.

Also, the petition did not include an artist's rendering. Which directions will the rooms face? Judging from the square on the map, you'd probably want to advocate for no balconies overlooking the neighborhood, but balconies are probably not in their plans. I assume they are shooting for a Comfort Suites or something along those lines which generally don't have balconies. I'm sure they don't have a contract yet, but I'm guessing they will go upscale, rather than something inexpensive like an America's Best or  Rodeway Inn.

Otherwise, it's an exit on the highway. Maybe the six houses which back up to the property will be locked into something near their current value (which is much more than every one of them paid for their house) and their property may not increase at as high of a percentage as every other house in the neighborhood, but the jobs created, property tax for the business and the tourism tax generated by the hotel will be worth a lot more to the county than the total property tax paid by those six houses.

I'm sorry and yes, I'm a bit happy that we did not buy one of the six houses when we looked at it five years ago. If we had, we would probably be trying to find a different house now, either because of the coming hotel or for the reasons we ruled it out in the first place.",t2_1phb4mw2,RW63,0,1648329904.0,0,t1_i28mk5t,i28mk5t,False,Analog_Audio_Guy,t3_tp2krn,https://www.reddit.com/r/321/comments/tp2krn/they_are_trying_to_build_more_hotels_and/,They are trying to build more hotels and suffocate the locals out.

"I can appreciate the desire to reduce transients but I don’t think blocking this investment will change this problem. I’m from Daytona originally and I can attest to the relationship between economic surplus and transient surges. Race week, bike week, concerts, and other tourism activities increase transients. The hotel itself will not impact this problem. That said what we would then be discussing is whether economic invest that appeals to tourism in our community is worth dealing with more transients. Sorry for the straw-man argument but investments like these help local businesses which in-turn creates community wealth in the forms of jobs and services.

"I'm not a parent but was formerly a student at both Stone and Palm Bay.

It was fine and I turned out fine. Each school had some fairly typical problems (fighting, bullying, lack of funding) but I feel like those problems were blown up because of the perception that each school has and the idea that x school is better (conveniently, the schools in the high income neighborhoods).

If you've got a kid who is academically driven/advanced then there's less to worry about as heathersaur said. Advanced kids are in their own little bubble away from the general population since they all take classes together. This does come with some issues in the sense that these kids can develop a sense that they are ""better"" than everyone else. There's also the perception that these kids should be more mature and adult-like but they're just kids at the end of the day.

I am not a parent but I think it's important to let your kid have fun and explore their interests in middle school. The academic competition and pressure really amps up in high school, especially if he keeps taking advanced courses where college is expected. At the end of the day, if he isn't being challenged and engaged you can switch schools. I'm also of the opinion that a great education starts and ends at home.

Stone ***is*** a great school for STEM. When you are looking at score from schools, remember that it's the overall average not broken down at all. I went to both Stone and Palm Bay high - both schools that tons of people here like to look down on, yet I know so many of my classmates that did STEM/Honors/AP/Duel Enrollment that all went on to college to get Bachelors, Masters, and Doctorates.

And honestly? A lot of those people who went on to be 'high achievers' credit their teachers from Stone for helping them find their passions and nurturing it early on. I am still friends with some of the teachers I had while I was at Stone because of that as well.

"It’s funny because it’s true.

2018 exit polls:

>According to exit polls, 61 percent of non-college-educated white voters cast their ballots for Republicans while just 45 percent of college-educated white voters did so. Meanwhile 53 percent of college-educated white voters cast their votes for Democrats compared with 37 percent of those without a degree.[1]

Continued erosion of the conservative levels of education

> At the beginning of this century, Republicans held an 11-point edge on party affiliation among college-educated voters. By the time Barack Obama was president, the figures had flipped to become a 4-point edge for the Democrats. And as President Donald Trump’s term was winding down, the numbers had come full-circle and the Democrats had a 13-point edge among college-educated voters on party affiliation.[2]

Why do you think y’all conservatives have gone full on anti-education and anti-intelllectualism? Because you’re being led that way. Like sad little sheep. 🐑

As I stated in my comment that you're now replying to, more recent data shows otherwise.  


The industry with the biggest delta (after controls are applied), is warehousing where women make 0.96:1 can that have anything to do with biological differences between men and women and their ability to consistently lift heavy things?  


Women make 1.01:1 to men in engineering and science.  This gap gets bigger when looking at young, unmarried women in technology.   


""Legal"" is an interesting industry to look at.  Uncontrolled has the biggest gap, but controlled data has women in the lead.

"Oh, you are getting so close to understanding it!  So yes, ask that question: why aren’t women moving into those better paying male dominated careers today?  Is it more likely they are biologically predisposed to lower paying careers… or are the on the ground effective freedoms of a class of individuals who until the modern age could not participate fully in our democracy possibly be a slight shade lesser than the written law?  Could it be that there remains attitudinal pressures at key decision points by persons that still hold prior cultural norm feelings of women as lessers?

Consider both possibilities and decide which seems more plausible given the entirety of the context.

"In my teens and 20s I skimmed here (33 now). The furthest North is Satellite Beach, but the last place to check because of the reef, only skimable at dead high tide, and still its a little sketchy. Paradise Beach Park will get good skim at times, but there's life guards and crowds, have to time it there just right. Double Tree is the next place south, hit or miss there depending on the sand bar. Next is Dunkin Dounts area and the walk up beach access there. After that, Long Doggers Beach access. Still going south, Boardwalk. This place use to fire all of the time and the beach we visited most tired with the the inlet. Now between Boardwalk and Ocean Ave, a few beach access there, hit or miss. Now south of Ocean Ave in Melbourne Beach, plenty of places to check all the way to Inlet, including Spanish House. All of these will break a little different depending on where the sand bars are. The holy grail is Sebastain Inlet. We would go there ALL of the time, the best waves I've caught in Brevard. I've been there when the sider was working. This will be the most consistent place. While you're down there, you can check Southside Inlet too. It's been a long time, but it was skimable at low tide. There's been times when north side will fire and south side isn't, and vice-versa. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

"I don't disagree with but you are comparing apple to oranges. We don't live in the past, it use as a reference. Just because a field is dominated by women doesn't mean women pay less. STEM degrees paid more most degrees. A women who majors in Norwegian cannot complain of a man is making 100k+ as a engineer or doctor. Women tend choose less demanding degrees. 

We as a country value harder fields of study.  You use a example of teachers, ok. (Paying teachers more is another argument, and I agree they should earn more)  Female teachers make less than female nurses who makes less than female engineers who make less than female neurosurgeons. Is there discrimination amogst women? 

We live in the safest and most prosperous time in human history. There are more millionaires then any point in history. Women have more rights now then they ever had. 
Compare a female engineer vs male engineer (excluding overtime, just base salary) The gap is negligible. 

Anedotal Example: In my field, we have female engineer who doesn't like to stay late, doesn't work overtime or come in on weekends. On the other hand, most of the male engineers willing do those things. It's not a knock on her, that her choice. But who going make more money?

"The problem is this analysis separates away all the historical context of what traditionally ferried women into exclusively lower paying roles and why those roles are lower paid.  We constantly talk about how we should pay teachers more, but we don’t, and that’s a position that has been traditionally filled with women.  Do we pay teachers less because we culturally devalue teachers, or is it truly because we have devalued women and they tended to be in those roles?

The entire discussion clearly has more nuance and depth to it and warrants a different venue than the off the cuff singular off topic opinions of some random guy.  The issue is not the content as much as it is the context.  Can you not agree with the inappropriateness of the subject at all for a guest speaker not brought in to talk about that?",t2_3hbm0u6d,esther_lamonte,0,1648077383.0,0,t1_i1v1omn,i1v1omn,False,esther_lamonte,t3_tkuc8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/321/comments/tkuc8d/prager_u_in_brevard_classrooms/,Prager U in Brevard Classrooms,/r/321/comments/tkuc8d/prager_u_in_brevard_classrooms/i1v1omn/,5,r/321,0,5
