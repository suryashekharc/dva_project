I’m more speaking to parts of the article like this. 

>	Pruett was yet another Republican carpetbagger – see Mehmet Oz, Carla Sands, David McCormick – hoping to use money, looks, and GOP endorsements to win in 2022. Senator Douglas Mastriano, sometimes described as a “Christian nationalist,” endorsed Pruett. She obviously hoped to run to the right of Fitzpatrick, and try to win the nomination that way. On her LinkedIn page she claims she stands for “election integrity.”


While I agree with the author, this isn’t journalism, it’s judgemental conclusion-drawing, as opposed to objectively presenting the facts and letting the reader judge for themselves and draw their own conclusions.

"First, you do not need to register a kayak in PA but kayak launch permitting is confusing. A state registration will allow you to use any state park (DCNR) or PA Fish and Boat access. This does not grant access to county waters but Bucks is the only county I know that requires their own permit for Peace Valley and Core Creek. Usually the boat launches at those parks sell them (not open now) -- otherwise try the park offices or rangers (if you see one) will have them. You do not need anything else to kayak Peace Valley or Core Creek.

As for the state, most kayakers just get a launch permit from either the DCNR or PA Fish and Boat, which are different permits and manage different waters. They honor each others permits and the prices are the same. DCNR you need to go to a state park to buy. PA Fish and Boat are easier to get at fishing stores, sporting goods, tag places, etc as well as ordering online. There is a list online who sells them. You can buy one or two years permits.

You do not need a state launch permit if you aren't kayaking water or using a launch controller by the DCNR or Fish and Boat. So if a state park you need one. If you kayak the Delaware or Schuylkill you don't need anything as long as you don't use their access points/launches. It is just easier to get a state launch permit and not worry about it. If you are just going to stick to Bucks county parks above don't bother getting a state launch permit or registering with the state.

A simple way to think about it is who owns/controls the park or launch for the water you are using. They are the ones that sets the rule and probably need to pay.",t2_127nwz,ShadyClip,0,1648280604.0,0,t1_i263lbn,i263lbn,True,StakedPlainExplorer,t3_tofk3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/BucksCountyPA/comments/tofk3w/bucks_county_kayakers_please_help_with_questions/,Bucks County kayakers: please help with questions about permits.,/r/BucksCountyPA/comments/tofk3w/bucks_county_kayakers_please_help_with_questions/i263lbn/,11,r/BucksCountyPA,0,11

EDIT: apparently there’s conflicting information. One place says “any managed waterway or lake”, another says you need to register only if it’s going in a state park lake. Core creek is a Bucks park, not a state park.

State registration is two years. I would assume Bucks is one year.

"I know I’m a bit late to this thread, but hopefully it’ll help some other expectant moms who might see this. Whatever you do, do NOT use an agency. I tried it for my first baby. Hired someone months in advance, she canceled, and the agency refused to refund the placement fee, which was thousands of dollars. They offered to find a replacement, but I also discovered they fraudulently charged my credit card for something else, so I didn’t trust them anymore. 

Another friend paid a large upfront deposit to another nanny agency, only for them to show her candidates that either hadn’t worked in years or were very strange upon interviewing.  I’ve used Facebook groups to find babysitters and a friend has found a nanny through Sittercity.

"I've got an odd combination of experiences from the two districts; my family moved to Yardley from NJ while I was in college so my brother attended Pennsbury, and I currently live with my family in Neshaminy.

My brother had a good experience in Pennsbury, and I think it was a much better opportunity than where we lived previously. One thing I do remember (that others have mentioned) was the ""affluence divide"". This was something we were very familiar with back in the NJ district I grew up in, but some of the stories he had were that it wasn't always as bad on the inside with the kids as the parents made it out to be on the outside.

When my wife and I were looking for our first home we knew we couldn't afford NJ (where we both grew up) so we looked in Bucks where my parents were living. She's a middle school teacher so education was very important to her, and she basically came armed with areas we could live based on the districts. We were basically narrowed down to the Nesh-Penn area of Lower Bucks and found we could get ""more house"" on our budget in Neshaminy. I've currently got two kids at Tawanka and the school, teachers, and administrators have all been awesome. Based on my past experiences I was afraid of that ""affluence gap"" but I've never encountered it, it feels very much like a community and most of the parents I know grew up here.

I'm personally very happy with the decision we made and with Neshaminy so far, but Pennsbury isn't a bad choice. We chose based on what was best for us - we knew Pennsbury scored a bit better, but I've got a house with a big yard for my kids to play in, and we've had great experiences with the district so far so I don't doubt the choice I made.",t2_4dwvkfcq,CptEggman,0,1647956527.0,0,t1_i1nrkcc,i1nrkcc,True,Used-Mode1484,t3_tjbrx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BucksCountyPA/comments/tjbrx7/pennsbury_or_neshaminy/,Pennsbury or Neshaminy?,/r/BucksCountyPA/comments/tjbrx7/pennsbury_or_neshaminy/i1nrkcc/,2,r/BucksCountyPA,0,2

"We originally lived in Council Rock SD and when we moved, we considered anywhere in CR, Lower Makefield/Yardley or Langhorne.  Council Rock was the best of the three districts but they are all good but you'll hear negatives about all of them depending on what exactly someone is focusing on.  

Pennsbury has a very strong divide between the very wealthy and the not so wealthy.  They have the traditional grades for each school level.   At the HS, they have a great prom.  I've heard Pennsbury is the better of the two if you need an IEP.

Neshaminy has different income levels but it's not as distinct as Pennsbury.  Neshaminy has a strong music program elementary through high school.  They start middle school at 5th grade.  It gives more extracurricular options at an earlier age but 5th grade can be young to deal with the earlier start time, changing classes and such.

Both HS have many successful sports teams.    Higher academic rankings between the two high schools changes every few years and/or depending on which ranking system that you are looking at.

"My kids are in the NSD while my wife’s kids are in PSD, so I can give my feelings on both districts. Personally, I think Neshaminy has the better schools. I have attended the schools that my kids go to and the ones my wife’s kids go to, and although there isn’t much difference, Neshaminy’s just has a more up-to-date feel to them. Hell, the school my step-kids go to doesn’t even have air conditioning, so if it gets too hot outside, they usually dismiss early and have actually closed the school due to it. I know that Neshaminy has a higher suicide rate, but Pennsbury has a higher drug usage. Neither school district is perfect, far from it actually, but the education is pretty similar. I’m not going to actually give you a preference here, just some info as a parent of kids who attend both districts. My kids in NSD usually tell me about a ton of drama, between other students, them, whoever. I’m not a fan of 5th graders in the middle schools. I don’t think they have matured enough to begin a new school, have to learn an actual schedule and go to different rooms for classes. Early in the school year, it was difficult for them to adapt, and they were introduced to students who came from different elementary schools and it just seemed to be very overwhelming early on. Now they seem to be doing much better, as both my 5th graders have made honor roll the past 2 marking periods.

As for the Pennsbury kids in the house, there doesn’t seem to be as much drama, but they talk so negatively about their teachers on a daily basis. They aren’t a fan of the way they teach, or how they are looked at being related to students who have preceded them in the schools. Obviously that wouldn’t be an issue for you just moving into the districts, but it’s not the kids faults for what these teachers experienced from their cousins, aunts, and uncles. Pennsbury football games usually have a ton of drama and fights, which is not something I have experienced at Neshaminy games.

"As a Neshaminy graduate and now parent in CR district, I’d lean Pennsbury. Although they have great elementary schools at Neshaminy and I had a great middle school, there was a suicide problem at NHS when I was there (at least 4 in the class of 2006). A lot of this was blamed on their zero tolerance policies which some might argue are necessary in a school of that size but Pennsbury is similarly sized and did not have that issue. I had several teachers that were known “issues” and my brother had the same teachers/issues years later. The problems were never addressed. I suppose every school has good and bad eggs.

Growing up in the area, I can say that the Pennsbury area has excellent extra curriculars. They have sports and clubs beginning at a young age so the school district teams are competitive in nearly every sport. They also have a very successful marching band and famous prom.

My honest advice, check their board meeting minutes online. See how the Administrators and the Board talk to its families and community members. Neither districts have stellar records, but you can pick the less desirable habits you are willing to put up with. IE, Pennsbury Board is incredibly rude and they waste a TON of money, so PTO organizations fund a good portion of the schools, creating an imbalance between the buildings. Neshaminy is also fairly rude (just in a different way), has better spending habits, but that means the buildings across the board are more ""out of date"" then your typical Pennsbury Classroom, but each room has the same technology available.

My understanding is that Neshaminy SD is K-4, then 5-8 for middle school. Pennsbury is the more traditional K-5, then 6-8 for middle school. Neshaminy middle schools do not rank as highly as their elementary and high schools. Pennsbury is pretty solid across the board.

If you're looking for traditional, good schools, sounds like Pennsbury on those two metrics. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

However, the areas are different demographically. Average household income across Pennsbury is ~$143k vs. Neshaminy's ~$115k. Your kid's about to head into the pressure cooker that is junior high, when cliques form and very likely solidify. For a lot of kids, those cliques are directly or indirectly tied to the parents' expendable income. 

Neshaminy SD, with its more middle class, more diverse population figures, would foreseeably have lower expectations in that regard.

"I am a Central Bucks grad, class of ‘97, and have lived in Philly most of my adult life, so have watched the area… maybe change, maybe just reveal more of itself. When I went to undergrad, I very much understood that I had received an excellent public education, compared to my college classmates. Adult me has more questions about it though. My 9th grade honors history teacher (a libertarian) taught us that the civil war was not about slavery 🙄. But he also scheduled us for a verrrry connected Washington DC trip where we had breakfast at the Nat’l Press Club w presidential speechwriters, and met senators and congresspeople, etc. So, I mention that bc it’s a good example of the sort of mixed bag you’ll encounter: opportunities rooted in privilege, and all the trappings of white supremacy and unexamined suburban capitalism that accompanies it. And yes, you will be encountering an ever-expanding pennsyltucky element, even in Bucks Co, esp as you head up 309.

"Central Bucks schools were great and still mostly are. Like many others have mentioned the school board is leaning far right but doubtful you will find many places in the area that aren't having similar issues. Housing over all is in demand and adding a highly recommended school district you aren't going to find many bargains or properties that sit long. Even the older splits are selling well due to being more affordable than the new townhouses and single family homes which are getting very pricey.

Doylestown is pricey but here and there you can find some smaller twins that are a bit more affordable. Most of the communities in Central Bucks are decent and a mix of sort of rural, suburban sprawl, and towny. More urban towards 611 and Philly, then more rural as you go north.

"Aight...

For those wondering, a 302 is apparently slang for ""involuntary commitment"", referencing Section 302 of the PA Mental Health Procedures Act. 

A person can be placed in involuntary commitment for any period of time up to, but not exceeding, 120 hours if they are reasonably believed to be a danger to themselves or others, due to either violent/harmful behaviors or inability to care for themselves. 

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

OP, in the past five months you've posted about a string of incidents that do not sound like the type of things that happen to an adult making reasonable, responsible decisions.

* bedbugs in your home
* getting evicted because of damages resulting from a ""burglary""
* misunderstanding elementary science and persistently defending your ignorance
* asking for help for a ""friend"" who was involuntarily committed to a mental health center because of lies

I am going to strongly advise if you/your friend are being abused and neither law enforcement or medial professionals are picking up on it, you/your friend need to get out of the situation as soon as the 302 is up and consult an attorney. Do not consult random strangers on the Internet.

"Absolutely. But as others have said, just showing up when you say you will and then getting back with a quote within a week will put you ahead of 90% of the folks we’ve dealt with lately.

On the entrepreneurial side, what I really want is a single company to take over all of my exterior needs. Charge me some amount per month and keep everything looking great. (Pull weeds, touch up paint, rehang a shutter, power wash the front walk, clean out the gutters, etc.). Then for the bigger items or anything requiring selection (new roof, new mailbox, etc), send me a quote and a timeframe. This would make my life so much easier.

I’d love the same for the house interior too. Maybe a house flipper who can walk through and identify all the things that should be fixed, replaced, repainted, deep cleaned, etc (possibly also with a running list from us) and then make it happen.

It’s exhausting to try to identify all these things and then deal with 30 different contractors who don’t show.

"Fellow Bucks County business owner here. You're asking the wrong audience. 

Reddit, especially this subreddit, is more progressive than the general public at large. I'd welcome a woman into the traditional blue collar space. I'm in printing (blueprints, signs, banners, etc.) and work with contractors all day long and based on conversations I've had, would suggest your roadblock is going to be 'macho-men' homeowners.

However, I can counter by saying that there's a lot of women who run the household in Bucks, so with a really good marketing plan, you could be very successful. Take a look at [Girls Auto Clinic](https://www.girlsautoclinic.com/) in Upper Darby. They were able to garner national attention for leaning hard into gender by creating a 'perceived trust safe-space' for women (and men) to have their vehicles serviced by women and the stigma of being taken advantage of absolutely exists in roofing (and other contractor trades/professions). 

So I think it's certainly possible, but you'll need a super strong business plan with an aggressive marketing plan. The other option you have would be to be low key about being a woman owned business and let your integrity build and take referral work and handle it more organically, like a traditional business plan. But try not to be discouraged if you run into the meat heads and lose a bid because of your gender.

I wish you the best of luck!",t2_331h8,MDKAOD,0,1646923016.0,0,t1_i03zoxv,i03zoxv,True,Public_Alternative31,t3_taw03c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BucksCountyPA/comments/taw03c/woman_owned_roofing_companys/,Woman owned roofing company’s,/r/BucksCountyPA/comments/taw03c/woman_owned_roofing_companys/i03zoxv/,19,r/BucksCountyPA,0,19

Yes you are right she did so PARTIALLY  because of $ but that's not the only reason right? It was the only resource listed on that school's website.  Their SI says the ""provide information to families who request it.” it does not say they provided those resources to her. There's a reasonable expectation that if you go to your school's website for help they would point you in the right direction.  


 Why is this the only one the website? Why if they teach against school curriculum would the school highlight them this way?

"**Footy in Philly is back!**

Australian Rules Football (go check out r/AFL!) is a native Australian sport that combines skills used in rugby, soccer, and basketball into an incredibly unique, fast-paced game that challenges all the muscle groups. Looking for an ELI5? There's a great short explainer of the sport here:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMZYZcoAcU0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMZYZcoAcU0)

  
The Philadelphia Hawks are Philly's representative club in the [USAFL](https://usafl.com/), and we are looking for new members interested in learning the game! We're an inclusive bunch, and we welcome anyone from ex-Aussies looking to get a kick in again, to those who are just hearing about it for the first time! We work with all skill and fitness levels - we're not just looking to grow the team, but to expand the knowledge of the sport as a whole. Our training and Social Footy events are great non-committed opportunities to learn about the game, meet new people, or simply get some great exercise without slaving away on the treadmill. Come check it out and if you like it, come back for the next one - and if it's not your cup of tea, no worries, but good on ya for giving it a go!

  
Even if you're not sure about getting out on the field quite yet, you can come meet us afterwards for a pint at a local pub or brewery (check out our social media pages for locations in the future) and chat with the team to find out if its for you. We host social activities throughout the year, centered around Australian sport and culture - Grand Final parties, Australia Day parties, bar crawls and more!

  
So come join us at one of our upcoming events or practices - get a feel for the crew and find out if this sport is for you! Give it a go outside of your comfort zone! Don't be scared - you can't be [any more awkward at it than Conan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8VTSGLCa1M).
