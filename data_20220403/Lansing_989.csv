"This is beautifully written, and exactly the kind of post I was looking for; an objective opinion with no sugar coating. It sounds like just the place I'm looking for, even with all the negatives, most of which don't really apply to me. I'm a 27 y/o introvert, I have no interest in bars or night life, I just want a quiet, affordable place to live with nice people, and Lansing sounds just like that.

As weird as it may seem, a stagnant city is what I want. I did notice on the wiki page the population has been very slowly declining since the 70s, though I anticipate in the coming decades as more people like me are being economically pushed out from our cities, places like Lansing will see a rise in popularity. I just hope it doesn't rise TOO much. I've had to witness first hand in Phoenix how a city's explosion in popularity absolutely ruins it for everyone else.

"I am from Toronto, Canada, and lived in Ann Arbor and Metro Detroit before moving to Lansing a year ago. Here are some things I've noticed as a new person:

* Lansing is very affordable. You can buy a nice house in a nice neighborhood. The salaries are a bit lower but they have plenty of good jobs and a low cost of living. Government, university, insurance companies, and GM is opening a new EV plant on the west side of the city.
* It is centrally located in Michigan. 1 1/2 hour to the Detroit airport. You can take a $30 Amtrak to Chicago for the weekend or drive in a few hours. You are a lot closer to ""Up North"" AKA Michigan's vacationland than in Detroit. And you are very close to Grand Rapids, which is a very cool and up and coming city, and the Lake Michigan coastline.
* Lansing is not up and coming, but it isn't really depressed like so many other rust belt cities. I would say Grand Rapids is more up and coming, and Lansing is sort of stagnant. You could look at GR as an alternative if it's more your vibe, and it also isn't that unaffordable and has more jobs.
* There is no traffic anywhere, as someone from big cities I have never seen what I would call a traffic jam. I disagree with others, people here drive fine. Detroit is a lot worse.
* If you aren't from Michigan you may think Lansing is blighted. Many cities in Michigan suffer from urban blight, but Lansing isn't the worst.
* The downtown is suffering from remote work and the pandemic, and they are trying to bring it back.
* There doesn't seem to be a big unemployment issue in Lansing. The economy has diversified in the last few decades.
* Okemos was recently rated as the #1 community to live in Michigan. My favorite suburb is the east side, Okemos/Haslett/East Lansing. I wouldn't move here if you want to live in an urban setting. You would love it here if you like a suburban feel.
* They have a lot of really great restaurants.
* There's a TON of bugs here. Like so many. And they try to come in your house too. You'd have to get used to mosquitoes and humidity. It is a lot less humid in places near the Great Lakes. Also, our winters are not nearly as brutal as other states on the Canadian border. It's a lot worse in MN, WI, Upstate NY, etc.
* People are friendly and very laid back, when I moved here it really felt like fresh air and slower pace compared to the city.
* Old Town is where the nightlife is, there isn't much. East Michigan Ave also has a few spots, but again there isn't much. Don't move here if you need nightlife. East Lansing nightlife is for people under 25.
* People generally have moderate political views.
* 40% of people I meet grew up here, and it seems like 60% of people I meet are newish. A lot of people are moving here, but a lot who grow up here are leaving. So there is a surprising amount of people from other states living here.
* The people who grew up here all know each other, or have 1 mutual friend/connection if they don't know each other. But they are still friendly and welcoming and don't treat others like strangers.
* There are barely any flights out of Lansing airport anymore. You can fly seasonally to Mexico, Las Vegas and Florida I believe. And they have direct flights to DC, Chicago and Detroit. Have to drive to Grand Rapids or Detroit for flights most of the time. This is a down side.
* Violent crime and shootings are on the rise in the south side of Lansing.
* Local taxes in East Lansing and city of Lansing are high. Others like Delta Twp, Meridian Twp etc aren't.
* No concert venues, but you can drive to GR or Detroit.

I own a house with no mortgage and I am behind a nature preserve. I see deer every day in the backyard and plenty of other critters. It's quiet, theres trails and parks all around me, yet I have every store I need 5 mins away. Whenever I go into local shops in the region, I have 10 minute conversations with people.

"I'm not personally a car guy, but some friends are so I kinda can answer some stuff now and will answer more when I get info from them. Rally racing is a thing here, but I don't know how many races take place. The annual one I know about is the Sno*Drift Rally, it takes place about 2.5 hours north and is a two day event every winter. Yes, winter rally lol. Here's the link I found about it, the videos I've seen look fun; https://www.sno-drift.org/

My friend races his souped-up Miata at a course. I don't know the acronyms you mentioned, but I'll share them with him and tell you what he says. I'll skip talking to another friend that does drag since you're not into that.

As for Nascar type stuff, an old classmate of mine posts a lot about his racing on his FB. He seems to have a garage of both nascar type things and....Dodge Neons with warpaint and race tires haha, maybe that makes more sense to you. I'll send a message and ask where he races, his cars are something entirely different from my Miata racing friend.

MIS is only about an hour from downtown, but Corrigan Oil Speedway (formerly called Spartan Speedway) is in Mason, just 15 mins from downtown Lanisng. Here's the link to them; http://www.corriganoilspeedway.com/    It's no MIS, but it's a racetrack. Wouldn't surprise me if this is where the nascar-type guy I know races.

Auto shows. Oh Lordy. You're an 70-90 mins from Detroit, so you KNOW that shit is big there. Two things come to mind; the Woodward Dream Cruise and the North American Auto Show. These are both huge events. The Dream Cruise is something that YOU can participate in. You'll see literally every sort of auto there, it's literally a parade of cars non-stop for like an entire weekend. Great to pull up a chair and a cooler and just watch it go by. It spans a section of Woodward in the Detroit suburbs, so like 90 min away. The North American International Auto Show is the big dog, put on by auto manufacturers and takes place in downtown Detroit. It's when they unveil prototypes and all that fun stuff. Huge attraction.

On a smaller scale, sometimes I see pop-up car meets here in town on Friday or Saturday nights in the summer. Location seems to vary, but lately it's in a parking lot on Cedar and Cavanaugh in the south side of the city. When I was a kid it was called ""the gut"" and you'd ""cruise the gut"" but I don't know if they still call it that. I also don't know the crew that organizes it or how to know when to look for it. Always seemed random to me. The cars seem to span the range from neon underglow to classic cars.

I'll come back with more information if/when my friends respond.


**edited to add**

Yep, Nascar guy races at Corrigan and some other places. So that's Lansing metro. My Miata friend races at a Waterford Hill Road Course (1 hr away) and an end-of-season race at Gingerman Raceway (1 hr 45 min). He says he instructs people to race, and gave me a link to his clubs;

"(i accidentally wrote a novel again I'M SORRY)

I do, actually, I'm glad you said something! I know most people on a general city subreddit aren't going to be car people, and there's usually an (understandably) negative connotation if you mention you are one, which is why I hadn't brought it up. To that end, just want to go on record that I do not street race nor do I have any desire to. I drive like a granny and keep the WOT for the track.

I've competed in SCCA AutoX in CAM-C with my 05 GTO for a few years now. I love Autocross for how cheap and easy it is to get into, so having something like that in or near Lansing would be cool, but considering how small the city is I expect I'd have to go to another city for something like that? Since I've been doing autox for a while now and have a few trophies under my belt, I was wanting to move up to NASA and SCCA road course racing before finally deciding I need to prioritize moving out of Phoenix before dropping more money on racing. I would love to still get into it in MI, but a dedicated road course is even less common than AutoX, so I assume again that's something I'll have to travel a bit to get to?

I also do RallyX in my 15 Focus ST, I haven't really given it much thought actually but considering MI is not a desert (aside from the dunes in a way) I don't expect there to be many, if any, rally motorsports out that way. I was, however, wanting to start an off road build (since most of my friends have their own) and off road trails are definitely something I anticipate MI to have plenty of. 

As far as drag racing goes, its not my personal cup of tea, but it's still fun to go once in a blue moon to run or even just to spectate. Phoenix is closing its one and only drag strip next year, which is incredibly depressing, but considering MI is the muscle car capital of the US, I'm going to assume there's good drag strips around? 

I love NASCAR and I'm ecstatic that I'll able to go to Michigan international speedway. I go to the Phoenix raceway every year but with it being a 1 mile track, its kind of boring. MIS, however, is TWO miles, so I'm super stoked for that.

Car shows & car meets are cool on occasion but, on the whole, I'm not a huge fan because the people that attend them, at least in Phoenix, are usually extremely obnoxious and insufferable. However, it seems like people in Lansing & the Midwest in general are a lot nicer people, so maybe it'll be different? I have a friend in grand rapids who has been to a few, I know classic car shows are very common here, but are there ever any other general types of car shows & meets?

"The pot holes are definitely the biggest drawback for me. However, since I compete in a few different motorsports, my daily driver also doubles as my rally car (and is therefore specced to handle rough terrain) so I like to think MI roads are just another rally course in terms of bumpiness lol.

Is there a reason MI on the whole has such terrible roads? Is your department of transportation underfunded or does the winter just cause roads to break way more often than in the west?

"We just moved to the Lansing area and, although we DO have our own DIY home sec system, regardless of whether you do or not a sign in the front yard, door is the easiest, cheapest thing to do. Lowes, Home Depot, Menards, Ace etc sell them (generic, unbranded) and we decided to stick our biz logo on it to give it more 'credibility' 😁 Having  timed, motion or light/dark sensors on the front, sides, back lights are the second thing we worried about. Sadly, some people simply leave these lights ON all the time which is an incredible waste, but if it works for them... Depending on the type of light, switch and/or connectiion there's plenty of options for turning these ON/OFF automatically in the abovementioned vendors. Don't ever let the grass (assuming you have a yard) or snow (depending of the season) without attention, that might give the impression of 'nobody's home'. Same with garbage/recycle bins and mail, don't leave them unnatended for days. If you're not going to be home for a while, have someone you trust do these for you or ask the USPS to 'hold the mail' til you're back...we could go on about the homr sec systems options, pros/cons but that's a whole other topic (and we're biased ofc 😁)...pretty much everything else we can think of everyone else had said already.

"I don't prefer to bike the surface streets, but the city is making an effort to make them more bike friendly by adding lanes. I'd feel better with physical barriers, and I think eventually those will come. [Here's a map to the paved bike trail system](https://lansingrivertrail.org/Map/). We call it the Lansing River Trail because that's how it began, but now it spans grasslands, forests, river, college campus, and urban areas....and somehow it's all within city borders. It's a gem. They're always working to improve and expand it too. I hope some day they expand it further west towards me. I used to live in Lansing city, and the trail is the one thing I miss most.

If you choose here, or any area with winter, I highly HIGHLY encourage you to embrace it. Do the shit out of winter. Locals tend to gripe and complain about winter because our winters are very cloudy (goodbye sun for six weeks at a time), but if they would just get off their ass and take up a winter sport, they'd learn to love and appreciate it. Cross country skiing is available local. There are some ice rinks. Some alluded to it, but Lansing winters are actually mild compared to other parts of Michigan.

"Kinda skimmed through the comments (always the same on these posts) so I'll add what may have been missed. 

You're into outdoors it seems? Lansing metro region isn't too shabby. 

* We're at the convergence of the Grand River and Red Cedar River, so **kayaking** is popular here. There are also several lakes where you can get on if that's your bag.

* We have **mountain bike trails** here; flow and single track. Downhill MTB is available, but those are out of town at our ski hills (45 mins to 3.5 hours away, more on that later). If you're into MTB, check out the All Trails app. Some trails are in the city proper, and several are adjacent and a short drive. SE Michigan has a TON of MTB too, so an hour drive to those. Boyne Mountain (2.5-3 hrs), Highlands Harbor Springs (3.5 hrs), Cannonsburg (1 hr), Mt. Brighton (45 min) are downhill MTB options. There may be more I don't know.  If you're more a road bike person, we have a pretty extensive paved bike trail system that spans the city from north to south and east to west. You share it with walkers, but it's ridiculously easy to get 30 mile rides in. We also have a BMX track in the city and state leagues if you're into that.

* **Hiking**. Tons of hiking around here. Again, All Trails app will give you the scoop. Some of my favorite spots are in Grand Ledge (previously mentioned by others) and Lake Lansing North.

* **Skiing and snowboarding**. We're not the Rockies, our hills range from 300-900 vertical feet, generally the further north you go, the more vert you get. That said, we're second in the nation when it comes to the number of ski areas. Depending on what side of town you're on, you're 45-60 minutes from the nearest ski lift. I'll just link you two of my previous in-depth comments on snow sports here. [post 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/mmtfvm/did_you_know_that_lansing_was_once_on_the_cutting/gttntb6/), [post 2] (https://old.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/kki9ww/any_good_snowboarding_places/gh86cl3/), and a [Complete Michigan Snowboard Guide](http://www.agnarchy.com/michigan-ski-resort-guide-2021-2022/). FYI, my snowboard season typically starts some time in November and ends some time in April, I plan on going tomorrow and the next few weekends.

Aside from outdoor life, we have several breweries in the Lansing area. It's easy to drink nothing but absolute local brews if that's your thing, and you don't have to hang out at the brewery to enjoy them. Michigan in general has a killer craft brewery scene.

"Always make it look like someone is awake and home. Put a visible from outside light on a timer. Keep your blinds closed. You can also set up a motion detector hooked up to a high lumen light, noise such as dogs barking, or (what I do) a sprinkler. 

Get more cameras. You want one where each entrance is and to cover any easily accessible windows. 

Check your basement windows. Sometimes they may be cracked or the plywood is easy to peel away then you expected. 

Do NOT hide a key. Instead, keep a ladder in the garage and an inaccessible window unlocked. 

You do not need to buy a gun, but you need a plan for home defense. General rule of thumb is: Hide Run Fight. What are the most inconspicuous places to hide to call for help from? What is your exit plan? Do you keep some sort of defense (pepper spray, bat, etc) in rooms you spend the most time in?

Lastly, if you are extremely concerned, make sure your homeowners insurance covers a robbery and that you have a list of pricy items in the home. It’s better than trying to remember every piece of jewelry if the worst happens. Any heirlooms or speciality items should be photo documented. 

At the end of the day, if you do not leave doors or cars unlocked and avoid placing expensive easily sold items in front of windows, you will most likely be fine.

"I like the Lansing area. I lived here for college, moved away for a decade to the PNW, and we just moved back to Michigan (my home state) to be closer to family now that we have a kid. We chose the lansing area because it’s affordable, centrally located, low traffic, low stress, has lots of convenient amenities, and great parks and trails. The freeways around the city are easy to navigate and you can cross from the far western edge of the metro (Grand Ledge) to the far eastern edge (Okemos/Haslett) in like 25 mins. All the basics are in easy reach. Lake Lansing is a nice public access lake in summer. I love the trail system at Lake Lansing north! There are numerous excellent nature areas- another fav is Woldumar nature center. Oh and the ledges in Grand Ledge are pretty and have a bit of rock climbing options. 
Lansing is a quick drive to the Detroit metro- it takes us just an hour to get to the Detroit Zoo in Royal Oak. Also, driving about an hour gets you to things like ikea or REI that Lansing lacks. I mean, you miss how it is in big cities!! You an spend an hour going 10 miles. Here, it’s just a breeze. We like to go to Hoffmaster State Park in summer for gorgeous sand dune beach days. Just an hr and half drive west. 
 From my point of view, Lansing’s biggest con is the absolutely horrible roads with tie rod breaking potholes. There are a lot of areas with a dilapidated look about them as well. Even some of the nicest areas have these issues- Okemos is quite affluent and absolutely riddled with potholes.

"I appreciate this so much, a novel is exactly what I was wanting and you gave so much good information, its a huge help!

In regards to the progressive politics, I did peruse the reddit a bit before posting this and noticed a few posts about harm reduction programs, which is so awesome. My cousin does narcan & needle exchanges here in phoenix but is constantly being accosted by the police for it and the practice is largely frowned upon by the populous, we only just recently legalized marijuana and it took some teeth pulling to do. I'm boring and the most I do is take prescription adderall but I'm 110% supportive of legalization across the board. Thats something I hadn't even really thought about but since you bring it up it adds another +1 for me.

Cost of housing is one of the main reasons I've been giving Lansing so much attention, the current duplex I'm renting for $1500/m (which is considered a good price, though I suspect my landlord will raise it soon) is 2bd2ba 1200sqft with a market value of 470k. A small peruse through zillow showed homes of similar or greater size around the $100k-$150k range, and thats with the housing market being inflated like crazy. Its honestly shocking. I was able to find a couple homes that, were I in the financial position to buy, would be perfect for me. If I move there, I assume I will have to rent for a time until I can get myself settled in enough to start house shopping. That being said, are rental properties just as affordable? You'd be lucky to find a studio apartment here for $1k/m. Is all of the south side Lansing not great, or just certain parts? I grew up in pretty rough neighborhoods so I dont need some rich gated community, though I still would like to avoid the really bad areas. Property tax is something I hadn't considered, and I'm glad you brought it up. I guess there was bound to be some kind of catch, but even with high property tax, I feel itll still be vastly cheaper than Phoenix.

I'm glad you added some downsides, I'm worried about getting rose tinted glasses, but even the downsides seem tolerable. Californians are some of the worst drivers in the country, and since they've been infesting Phoenix roads, the drivers here have gotten just as bad. I honestly cannot imagine Lansing could be any worse. I did hear pot holes are an issue though, that seems to be a common problem across all of MI it seems. How  is traffic in terms of congestion? Are there ever any regular gridlocks? Brutal winters is exactly what I'm looking for, which I know sounds crazy, but I can't express how much I despise the heat. I was originally born in Washington and I think some of that mossback blood still lives in me because I always seem to run hot and am most comfortable in the cold. I lived in Denver for a short time and desperately miss the winters there, I know MI winters are much more harsh than Colorado, but its something I'd rather deal with than day-in day-out sunshine, drought, and 120 weather.

Thank you again for your insight, I know I'm writing ANOTHER novel so don't feel obligated to answer everything, you've already helped a lot and its given me more things to research.

"Yeah, it's kind of good to see this type of stuff being built in South Lansing. People have been complaining about all the developments being in or around downtown.

"Hi! I want to start by saying good luck and I truly wish you the best in your search. I'd like to share some of my own opinions on Lansing. I hope this helps:

For context - I lived in Indiana (Indianapolis area) until I was 26 and moved to Lansing. I'm 28 now and I've lived here for almost 3 years. It was my first time moving out of my home state, so my impressions of Lansing are very fresh. 

I think in general, Lansing is a nice place to live. The people here are very welcoming and hard working. There are people from all different backgrounds and lifestyles that I appreciate. I don't get a lot of bad vibes up here from the random people I meet or encounter.

I love the fact that the state is living in the current year (no offense to Indiana or other states, but damn) and legalizing things like pot, sports betting, etc to get as much tax revenue as possible to make the state a better place to live. It's also nice to have the option to partake in those activities if you're into that kind of stuff. If you love the outdoors, then you'll love Michigan's endless opportunities for fishing, hunting, boating, hiking, swimming, etc...

The cost of living is pretty damn good. I ended up liking Lansing so much that I bought a house here. To give you an idea of how much cheaper it is to live here vs a place like Grand Rapids, I've had a couple realtors tell me the house I purchased here would go for over $100k more in Grand Rapids. That's no knock on Lansing, it just puts into perspective the cost of living here verse some other high profile towns around Michigan and some of the Midwest.

One other bonus that I personally enjoy is that Lansing has tons of big name stores and companies that make living here a lot more convenient. 

Some of the downsides of living in Lansing include: 
1. Truly terrible drivers and the treacherous potholes during the spring
2. Brutal winters. 
3. The property taxes in the state of Michigan are extremely high. Property taxes here are some of the highest in the country. 
4. Lack of flight options from the airport here. The airport is pretty small & hasn't added significant routes in a while.
5. The lack of concert venues here is a bummer. Several have shut down the last couple years, leaving tours to skip over Lansing for Grand Rapids, Detroit, and even Flint.
6. A rough south side that's gaining a reputation for younger adult violence

I know that's a lot, but I hope some of my opinions on Lansing help.

"I started New Hope Church just over a month now. It took me a while a find one. I Love it here because they teach the Bible verse by verse. This is a great way to learn without worrying about the true message of the Bible (God's word) being missed by taking out words and adding your own opinions. They give you an outline to take notes and Coffee for the service. They also have many groups you could be a part of. You learn the true message of the Bible...God Loves everyone and wishes that no one would perish and that you should Love (which is how everyone would know that follow Christ).

"Just my opinion, but the push to become Christian may not be so healthy. I grew up more or less agnostic and spent two several-year rounds in the religious zoo. What I've learned: it's all bullshit made up by people thousands of years ago probably to comfort themselves and because stories are meaningful to us and help us process our lives, but that over time these systems of mythological story-community have largely become outlets for evil and/or stupid people to manipulate naive and/or also-stupid people (I attribute naivety and stupidity to myself for having been a follower, but naivety and stupidity can both eventually be grown out of you if you are a truth-seeking person).

I understand the urge to seek God, the truth, ultimate meaning in life, etc. However, fair warning. In my experience the people in those places are making all that shit up because they WANT to believe, not because they actually know, have experienced any real interactions with supernatural entities, and certainly not because they have any actual proof of what they're teaching/believing. At the end of the day it all ends up being about humans controlling other humans through systematized storytelling.

"I have heard that too... and my understanding is that it's basically because they are government buildings.   
Buildings built before the 70's might have lead paint, or even asbestos.   
If I owned it: I would call my brother or one of my buddies and have him spray a mist of water into the air right where I'm chopping, and chop all of the asbestos out, while we are both wearing masks. (this is how the asbestos abatement companies do it)   
But since it is a public school, they have to use a ""licensed asbestos abatement company"" and the price is through the roof.   And it's a big building, so multiply that ""getting screwed"" by 74 classrooms.
   
This is just one example, but my point is that the government can't cut any corners with those things and therefore they end up paying a lot more than you or I would pay.

It takes less than a half-step further in thought to understand the idea that it's keeping people alive.

People are using drugs. Period.

Your implication is that you want them to die, whether you meant it or not, and people around you and in your life see you.

When you provide people with safety (and yes, up to and including safe drug use) gives them the opportunity to make better choices.

There are dozens of studies that prove safety and security leads to recovery far greater than punishing and stigmatizing addiction. People don't use for funsies, and they don't start using for funsies.

My whole high school experience had maybe 2 fights and isolated accounts of stereotypical bullying. My childhood friends have a fountain of endless stories of fights and violence.

"These are usually people advertising to ""Haul away your trash"", or ""apartment cleanouts"" on Facebook or Craigslist, or a sign on their truck.

"I’m new to the sub, but lived and have loved Lansing for a decade.

I can’t leave. I won’t leave. There were drive bys last year targeting a house across the street. In response, I’ve increased my investment in the neighborhood. Detroit is on a come up and has been for a few years because of community investment.

This goal that I share with the larger community is absolutely hampered by that p*ss baby Andy Schor.

But one ~13,000 people voted in the mayoral election. I’m hoping I can do more this year to ramp up community involvement. I can understand wanting to get away from it all, but if you stay in the Lansing area, please join my effort to get more townies involved and increase our shared stake in the stability of Lansing. I plan to raise my kids to adulthood here, and so that’s enough for me to get engaged.

So I hope, if you do stick around, to help make Lansing the city it could be.

"Burner account here, lifetime Lansing area and 20 years Eastside resident, now former as of this week. 


I had been trying my to move my family out of the wonderful Eastside that has been our home since before we bought one here. But when I saw the crime tape around a house and lawn with a CSI van out front and Lansing Police Command watching from the bike co-op across the street 6 doors from my house, I knew it was time to intensify my efforts. The VERY NEXT DAY when the SAME EXACT SCENE happened at the house next door, the last straw broke. At that point my wife and I threw it into Fifth gear, sold the second car, liquidated a minor 401K from a past job, and bounced the FUCK out. I don’t need a fucking Eastside Neighborhood  Association Newsletter to tell me that my neighborhood is dead. the two sets of neighbors across the street who are moving to new homes didn’t need one either. 


Lansing’s Eastside is done folks, and while rolling into Denver yesterday to hear that this 4 person shooting on Magnolia and Michigan occurring just doors from my wife's best friend reinforced that. Lansing isn’t safe, and you’re going to see more and more people like us leave, turn our houses into working professional rentals since property values are bonkers most desirable places to live outside of Lansing, so why would we sell both houses to have a house payment elsewhere? Why would a family even consider buying my houses on the Eastside knowing that Lansing is going to RISE from the 9th most violent city in america to an even higher top ten spot. I’m better off holding and keeping the neighborhood from seeing more families who won’t be coming and just be part of the “problem” by not having my family invested in the community. But at least my kid’s chances of being struck by an random bullet went down by my own personal “white flight”, something I always was bitter about my parents participating in when they left Detroit after the riots. Now with a 3 year old of my own, I can’t say I really blame them anymore. Being an activist in both politics and in business doesn’t count for shit when you're dead or paralyzed, or your family is injured or killed in random violence.


It’s very important to lay the blame where it is due. Andy Schor fired the Ward Sergeants as a part of restructuring for cost and to have HIS police force. Well Lansing, how do you feel about that giant vagina of a human now? The coward who lied to us in our driveways, who ran back behind his jackbooted thugs when the Flint Police talked town their community in the riots two years ago, and who said he “felt attacked” when this business owner and three others (very mild mannered women) asked non-threatening questions at their “Re-imagine the avenue” snow-job press event. Andy Schor has proven to be completely beholden to big money and the developers who are robbing our city blind. It’s telling when my progressive bleeding liberal friend business owners who are saying, “Fuck man, Verg was an asshole but we need him back.” And this progressive agrees. And the proof is that my city turned into a warzone. Thanks Andy. I hope the bullets terrorizing my friends in my neighborhood find you next.",t2_jijmfogc,NoLightOnMe,0,1647614044.0,0,t1_i15ofwk,i15ofwk,True,helenata,t3_tgpjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/lansing/comments/tgpjsr/eastside_party/,Eastside party?,/r/lansing/comments/tgpjsr/eastside_party/i15ofwk/,-14,r/lansing,0,-14

"Introducing James, Lupin, and Sirius!

These precious boys were house cats that were dumped to live outside and fend for themselves. Indoor cats do not have the instincts or training to live outside, and most of them do not adapt to survive. These 3 boys were slowly withering away while seeking shelter in an unused dog house until they ran up to greet one of our fosters!

These boys are in rough shape, but were thankfully taken in just in time. They've since began treatment for fleas, worms, and are receiving three gravy filled meals a day! 😻

They're acclimating perfectly to inside life, but will need extensive medical care including treatment for their worms and fleas, neuter surgery, and vaccines.

If you're able, please consider donating to Happy Feet Pet Rescue for their medical care! These funds go directly to the care of animals, and allow us to take in emergency cases like these 3 cutie pies!
