"I call BS. 

Socal native never left 43 years old. 

When people think of culture one of the first things we think of is the people and food. 

You would have a hard time finding better mexican food than in. Socal and even Norcal. 
The best Vietnamese Pho can be found in Socal as well. 
Pho 79 is hands down thr best Pho restaurant in the world ask most Viets will agree. 
Inn n out Burger used to be exclusively a California restaurant. 
Vegan and Soy latte capital of the world. I'm sure of it. 

You'd be hard pressed to find more physically attractive people in mass than Socal. I'd say California is the 
Fitness and Surfing Capital. 
San Diego County certainly can be considered one of the premier surfing destinations if not the top. 
San Diego is shares the same culture of L.A. and O.C.

"I keep telling people this - I could’ve afforded a condo back in 2018-2019 when I was in California last.  I moved for a year (required by job) and when I returned in 2020 homes that were $400k before now are $600k, in 2 years!  

I couldn’t buy back in 2018 because I didn’t have the 20% Downpayment and wasn’t sure about my final location.  Now that I have it, all the $400k condos are trash and $650K would mean I’m paying $3,500/mo on the mortgage, $400 on HOA and still need insurance and other on top of that.  I can no longer afford it.  

Rent in Orange County has had periods where a 1bed 650sqft apartment was going for $3,200/mo. At that point you might as well buy but thankfully it went down to $2,500-$2,700.

The whole situation is a joke and if you’re lucky the contracted company just covers the cracks with asphalt that washes away after the first rain.

(though a lot of times there is no war and the seller gets spooked and sells for whatever offer there is because if it's on the market for more then a week, there must be something wrong).

Any other industry it's a recipe for a crash. I'm not sure that holds here though. Inflation, interest rates, a lot of other things point to real estate being a good investment even at insane prices because cash flow won't ever be better. It's not the total, it's the monthly.

In all honesty. Despite SD being the second populated city in California, we have no active rail project at the moment, when compared to LA who’s building 4-5 extensions I believe right now.

"I don’t even know what is being debated. A correction in the near future is unlikely. A correction within a few years is likely. It isn’t that unusual and has happened many times. Market analysts have come to the same conclusion. I’ve studied this market since 2001. It was already a bubble years before it popped, most people swore it would keep going until the very end. Not only did I call it but I bought at the bottom, I wasn’t aiming for the bottom but for anything close and for a particular model I wanted. Got lucky anyways.

Follow the blog piggington.com it tracks everything in SD.

It is not possible to accurately predict the next bug correction without also predicting the rest of the economy. It would happen in tandem with most of the country and depend on credit and how close we are to a recesion. But small corrections are common and before the years leading up to the 2008 bubble it happened often. Ergo the bubble was the exception. People took that to mean corrections don’t happen which was wild. Please don’t.

"Demand for San Diego homes is virtually unlimited …. Homes in Phoenix going for $650k-$750k these days ….what’s another $500 -$1000 a month for a $1million home in Clairemont near the beach!? Demand will always be there but prices in San Diego (given unlimited demand) will always be a function of what people can  afford… and right now people can afford and will be able to continue finance a lot of mortgage … prices could only go down in the event we have large scale unemployment for whatever reason and folks get forced out for not being able to make the mortgage and the vacation rental economy dries up because folks cannot afford that either . Not really something to route for , but those two effects combined will likely have a compounding effect and the only scenario to take down housing Prices when folks who own multiple homes and are renting them out to covering their mortgage they originated  in 2014 and refinanced at the 2020 lows … I do think most owners got in early enough and were able to refinance low enough and enough private equity owns homes they won’t have to force sell in an economic downturn so this scenario will never really arise … and thus prices are most likely to continue to rise to whatever max price is financeable by ur typical San Diego house poor arsehole who contributes 60% of their income to rent or mortgage… such as myself … good luck everybody the fed has commoditized housing … having said all of this I still don’t understand the MANy vacant houses in my La Jolla neighborhood that are unoccupied and unrented ?

"Go to the top of Mt. Soledad by the cross late at night.

Sit down and think about all the problems, obstacles, and struggles in your life.

Take a look at the vast land and all there is beneath you, then take a look at the infinite universe and all the stars above...

Think about how big planet earth is... then realize how much bigger the rest of the world above you is. Really try and take into consideration how far out you can really travel in all directions between the heavens and the earth beneath you...

Once you have traveled the distance in your mind and you can no longer travel further, travel your way back and realize how small you really are in this universe. Then you will understand how much smaller your struggles truly are compared to the world around you.  Only then will you realize how little you have to overcome to be happy once again.

You may feel as if you're on top of the world looking down and the weight of the world is on your shoulders, but look up and remind yourself that you're just a speck of dust in the universe...

Once you come to accept that, you'll understand that although your struggles seem to be big in your head, they are quite smaller than you imagine.

Although we're this speck of dust, we'll always remain bigger than any struggle we may face.

So when it may seem like it's a lot to take on and you feel broken, realize how little you have to overcome in the grand scheme of things.

I wish you a fast recovery and remember that every time you thought you couldn't go on in life because the struggle was too hard to overcome... You've managed to overcome it 100% of the time.

That's why you're here today ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|slightly_smiling)

"Define: Culture, Define Value - those are hard things to define.  Your definition is probably not what others would agree with, nor would you agree with me.

Are there cultural activities - not many, lots of participatory things (ie: 5Ks, 10ks, etc) hiking, and such, there is some ""sailing"" (quite a bit actually) but its not like a ""Greek festival"" that is widely talked bout, the closest thing is stuff that occurs in Barrio Logan and the fireworks, but that is a USA culture thing.  

Culture - as in Museums, Symphonys, Operas, Plays? etc - yes we have it there are - one or two are really ""world class"" (in size and scope) but that does not mean everyone thinks of that as ""culture"" \[ie: The San Diego maritime museum is world class for Maritime Museums, but most people don't think of ""Maritime"" as ""culture""\]. Comparing the several other types of museums here verses other places - (ie: NYC, PARIS, LONDON - but that is not a fair comparison, those are ""world cities"" - San Diego is a nice place over in corner) Operas and Playhouses - Not shabby -  For example the LaJolla playhouse was the start of a number of Plays (See: Wiki:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La\_Jolla\_Playhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jolla_Playhouse#Productions)) but - other towns would have their own claims to fame, we are not unique.

Culture to me is this:  Name a city and name what is famous there, what event you you go there to see?   Chicago - the green dye in the river (St Patricks Day, ""the Windy City"" - hot dogs and baseball)  Miami - the beach, the bars, the cuban vibe.  New Orleans - the music.  Others have said the Bay Area & Asians - The Bay Area has a Famous China Town, so that amplifies all other things asian up there, there is also ""Hait Ashberry"", and/or the ""Castro District"" - those things are cultural in my mind.

But ask your self: What is San Diego Famous for that others know? (you can't ask somebody who lives here, pretend you are in NYC, and asked that question) The answer you would get is: Nice weather and the beach, next to TJ and Expensive ..

So do we have culture here - yes, culture like a medium to large sized town, ie: St Louis, Columbus, Atlanta, Tampa, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Portland, Denver, Kansas City, Austin, Salt Lake, Seattle, etc - and what we have is good, really good, but is it better then those cities I just named? I doubt it, each of them have their own ""claim to fame"" but no stand outs - nor are we a standout more then those other great American cities.

Can't put ""Philly"" in there - The fresh prince of Belair told the story about Philly and set the culture of what people think of Philly",t2_ntyad,duane11583,0,1648941373.0,0,t1_i35wizv,i35wizv,True,YouCantStopDaGoon,t3_tukshk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/tukshk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_people_saying_san_diego/,What are your thoughts on people saying San Diego doesn't have a culture compared to other big cities?,/r/sandiego/comments/tukshk/what_are_your_thoughts_on_people_saying_san_diego/i35wizv/,2,r/sandiego,0,2
