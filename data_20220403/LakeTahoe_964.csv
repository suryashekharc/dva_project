"There aren't really any ""vegan/vegetarian only"" type places like you'd find in an LA or SF. That said, there are a lot of really good restaurants and eateries that do really good vegetarian dishes. You'll just have to do a little work looking at some menus before you make a choice.

For more sandwich/casual options, Mountain High Sandwich Co. in incline does a great job of having vegan/vegetarian options (and their sandwiches are awesome).

Azaras for italian in Incline - would definitely have good veggie options.

If you eat seafood, can't recommend River Grille and their seared ahi + fresh veggie spring roll combo in Tahoe City enough. Maybe the best dish on the face of the earth.

In Kings Beach I'd expect Spindleshanks would have some choices?

Hiro Sushi is god in Kings Beach, as is Koi sushi in Incline.

Maybe Bite in incline would have some good veggie options too...

Vail has really f*d up by over-selling the shit out of their resorts and understaffing. If they don't course-correct, they will soon become the ""Dollar General"" of the ski industry.

"I agree with lenalulu2 and the other comment also.  I live in South Lake, very close to Heavenly CA Base lodge. I have relatives visiting this coming week, and I helped them plan their itinerary. I thought it might be helpful to add my 2 cents. In my opinion, Saturday's are a total nightmare at Heavenly and Northstar, because the crowds are huge and lift lines are extremely long. It really became worse in the last couple years; I used to have no problem with skiing Saturday's, even a few years ago, just before COVID. When my relatives come, we will be skiing Thu, Fri, Sun (afternoon only) and Mon. We are not going to be anywhere near the over-crowded ski hill on Saturday - instead we will be sightseeing around the lake. Might consider that if you hate standing in huge lift lines and dealing with gigantic crowds as much as I do. Good luck!

Additionally:  I've heard many recent reports of collisions on blue squares at Heavenly.  One person, who was an employee at Heavenly, had someone run into her on Ridge Run, which is a beautiful, but sometimes-congested blue square. She broke several ribs and her clavicle. The person who collided with her rode away and was not found. I bring it up because I honestly question the safety when so many ""guests"" are crammed onto runs, especially the congested runs on the most-crowded days. Safety is lacking; the over-crowding adds a risk factor. It pays to be highly aware of your surroundings on the crowded days. 

Some of the blue squares at Heavenly, example Roundabout, are the most dangerous runs on the mountain because they are congested and often have people straight-lining through the congested spots. They are ripe for accidents.",t2_9wwauv4n,_GFR,0,1645136891.0,0,t1_hxdb0kq,hxdb0kq,True,RedHott993,t3_sumg0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/laketahoe/comments/sumg0t/ski_trip_next_winter/,Ski Trip next winter,/r/laketahoe/comments/sumg0t/ski_trip_next_winter/hxdb0kq/,2,r/laketahoe,0,2

"A few things I'd recommend.

If you like camping try and snag a premium spot at Eagle Point Campground. It's got the best views of any campground I've ever been to.

If you don't like camping:

Take the aerial tram at Tahoe Palisades. There's amazing views and hikes to be had at the top including a restaurant.

Also consider taking the scenic gondola at Heavenly. It's not as impressive IMHO but it's in South Lake Tahoe which may be more convenient depending on where you're staying.

If you're into hiking consider hiking the Bayview Trail up towards desolation wilderness. It's called Bayview for a reason as your efforts will be rewarded with spectacular views of Emerald Bay.

Consider renting a couple of kayaks or if you're feeling adventurous rent a tandem for the both of you. My fiance and I rented a glass bottom kayak in Kings Beach and it definitely wasn't worth the premium cost above a normal kayak. You'll find yourself looking around more than down anyways, and the clear kayak distorts your vision anyways.

Also worth a look is a ride on the Tahoe Queen, a paddlewheel boat that goes out on the lake.",t2_9gn72,doozle,0,1645041941.0,0,t1_hx7ru3e,hx7ru3e,True,Major-Contributions,t3_su36k3,https://www.reddit.com/r/laketahoe/comments/su36k3/honeymooner_here/,Honeymooner Here!!,/r/laketahoe/comments/su36k3/honeymooner_here/hx7ru3e/,2,r/laketahoe,0,2

"I felt the exact same way in December when I read an article in the Tahoe Tribune about upcoming snow storms. The whole comment section was filled with negative sentiment about the clueless tourists that would be soon coming to town.  I commented and wrote something along the line of ""hey, can't we just be happy about a snow storm and not have a negative, us vs. them mentality?""

I really felt that way and still do.

Only thing, I will say, that tempered my positivity a bit, was that within a week I observed a range of idiotic behaviors from clueless people that almost turned me into a bitter local like many others seem to be.  I saw a guy driving his car, in a major storm, who had only cleared his front windshield, leaving snow on rear and side windows. He was on his phone texting at the time I saw him through his front windshield.  Conditions were very bad, I was white knuckling in my AWD:  this moron in a Prius didn't bother to clear his windows AND was texting while driving.  That's just one of a dozen examples of clueless, disrespectful behavior I observed that week...   I am not advocating having the negative, us vs. them mentality.  I try to be patient and teach people who have obvious difficulties, when they let me.  But it sure does take a lot of patience, since there are a lot of clueless people around in the winter. 

I support your effort to foster togetherness and a better overall attitude when it comes to how locals treat non-locals.  Just pointing out that it does take patience. :)",t2_9wwauv4n,_GFR,0,1644951633.0,0,t1_hx2jm1r,hx2jm1r,True,tahoebebe,t3_sst5ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/laketahoe/comments/sst5ap/so_sick_of_the_tude/,So sick of the tude,/r/laketahoe/comments/sst5ap/so_sick_of_the_tude/hx2jm1r/,3,r/laketahoe,0,3

"This is what we usually do with my boys when traversing to CA side and its all blue trail with an option to hit some single blacks.  
from StageCoach -> head down to Pepis trail to hit East Peak Lodge, then   
Take Dipper Express (you can take a couple of laps in dipper Bowl) -> then hit California Trail, this is a very long Blue (and sometimes green trail for me) then you can take Sky Express Chairlift. You can either take Lizs (blue/black) trail or head down to Ridge Run.  


Going Back, will be taking Sky Express then taking Skyline Trail (make sure you maintain your speed since there are lots of flat areas on this trail).  If you are still up for a black, Skyline Trail will hit Dipper woods and Mott Canyon.  Eventually you end back to East Peak Lodge.  Take Comet Express to hit Comet trail then traverse to Crossover then Olympic Downhill and return to Stagecoach trail.

"From LA to mammoth, once you get East of the mountains, you will be driving the ‚Äò395 corridor‚Äô, also referred to as ‚ÄôThe Eastside‚Äô. It is an indescribably beautiful drive bottom to top.  

The lower elevations will be dry and there will be numerous amazing hiking opportunities that are absolutely snow free.

  Where snow enters the picture will be highly dependent upon how much or little snow the region gets this spring.  Unless there is an active blizzard, many of the popular, shorter, medium elevation trails are often hikeable with moderate snow because they have been ‚Äòboot packed‚Äô. You will have to check back while you are in the region to get more accurate recommendations based on conditions. 

South of Tahoe, all of the passes will probably be closed. But there are plenty of options for a beautiful adventures in the massive amount of terrain that will be easily accessible year round no matter what the snow conditions are the rest of the season. 

Getting over a pass to Kings Canyon, Sequoia, or Yosemite regions from the East Side will probably not be an option. You will have to plan enough time to circumnavigate around the south or North through Tahoe to get to the West side of the Sierra‚Äôs. Even better, just plan a return visit.

"Yes, as others have mentioned, the strategy on the part of major resorts is to have a relatively cheap season pass. The pass is paid for, compared to the daily rate, in just a few visits. It encourages huge numbers of season pass sales. It also encourages pre-season purchasing which insulates those companies from the effects of a ""low-snow"" winter.

Most ski resorts these days don't even want to sell same-day tickets, that's why they're priced so high. They want to sell cheap season passes. Most season passes pay off after only 4-5 days if you buy them in summer/early fall.

"If you haven't been out since 2016, one other thing you should be prepared for is massively longer lift lines, at the big resorts, compared to back then. Especially on weekends.

I'm trying to be helpful, not negative, since it would suck to pony up big $$ for day passes, and then wait in long lift lines all weekend.

You might be better off with resorts that aren't on the Ikon or Epic pass, such as Homewood, Mt. Rose, Diamond Peak, et cetera.  Those probably have cheaper day passes and less weekend crowds.

"Ok‚Ä¶ so totally get that people complain a lot about housing and have blamed Airbnb.  But of 8000 housing units about 1400 were vhrs in the city.  6000+ were second homes.  Second homes that sit empty are the problem.

There is zoning for Airbnb in the city limits of South Lake Tahoe.  Measure T ended Airbnb in neighborhoods with exception of the Stateline area.  Most other municipalities around the lake have caps in place.  But I do agree with your point, zoning is a great way to tackle the problem.  I just think the Tahoe Keys and Heavenly Valley should have been zoned for Airbnb.

"The decision that Vail made to lower the season pass price, resulting in 76% more season pass sales compared to the previous season, along with ginormous crowds on the weekends, usually affects non-locals a lot worse than locals.

The locals that I know ski daily, except Saturdays, when the crowds are huge. If you are not local, odds are you are more-likely confined to weekends, where you will be more affected by the crowds. It's got to suck to drive 5 hours only to show up to a full parking lot and giant lift lines.  

For me, I live next to the mountain, so I don't care if traffic is bad or the parking lot is full. I ski almost daily and I can avoid the weekend chaos. 

But also consider, some people live 2 or 3 miles from Heavenly, near the 'Y' for example, and it can take them hours to get home from the ski hill on Sunday afternoon.  For decades it was never like that, until recently when Vail started selling huge numbers of season passes, for multiple mountains, at relatively cheap rates.  I personally think that is irresponsible on the part of Vail, since the infrastructure can't really handle the traffic, and since it has affected people's lives negatively.  (that's part of the reason why there is a huge backlash against Vail that has been getting a lot of press lately)

"Not a local but I‚Äôll play devil‚Äôs advocate since I‚Äôve been visiting Tahoe for several decades.

The #1 complaint is people coming in and taking housing from locals via AirBnB while not living here. This issue is slowly resolving itself via legal means.

Personally, I think there should be zoning for AirBNB just like hotels, since they are a business after all and create a nuisance.

More on housing, locals find it unfair that better off Bay Area resident are bidding up housing they can no longer afford under local wages. I feel their pain, but half of the issue is shitty local wages in a town that makes lots of money on tourists in the first place. Vail itself is partly to blame for that. They are paying their employees peanuts.

The #2 complaint lately seems to be about people lacking a general lack of respect, parking in neighborhoods and blocking driveways. Seems valid to me as well.

The main complaint we had for a while was about people not caring about COVID restrictions and coming in while local hospitals were at max capacity. Again, a valid concern, but Tahoe is in a unique situation with 2 very different states and rules, so it‚Äôs hard to take sides here. Plus most of the people I saw maskless were locals.

"It would add about $1000 to the cost of each vehicle in their fleet.  Also, the cars move around the country.  It's not like a Reno car only goes to lake Tahoe and only gets rented from the Reno airport.

"Ok, I agree that the Chart House is a good call if you make reservations and get good seating.

Next is Steak House at Harris‚Äôs called Fridays Station.  You can book that on OpenTable.

The Riva Grille is nice and a water Level view of the lake is possible.

I think the down and dirty option is The Beacon known for its rum runner drinks.  This is the cheapest option and this time of year more of a local meet up place.

So do the beacon for lunch and the Chart House for dinner.  That would be a great option.

Yep. I got married at Emerald Bay in September.

"Went to a friends in August, which was really nice. Basically May is typically the end of the cold season and October is when it restarts - typically the end of October is when you see the first snow (depending).

""Fire season"" is highly variable. Basically anytime it's not actively raining in California, it can be fire season. So... if the weather is nice enough for a wedding outdoor, it's nice enough to be on fire.

This year is the first time the fires got into the basin in a few decades (IIRC), that being said, with smoke and prevailing wind... a fire could be hundreds of miles away and still make life miserable.

"The Heavenly Gondola is a great idea. It‚Äôs about a 40 minute drive from Incline, so you can make a day of it. The Heavenly Village has a bunch of shops to check out. My favorite place to eat in south shore is the Lucky Beaver. It‚Äôs a burger spot. Then on the way back you can drive the opposite direction making it so you drove completely around the lake. There are some turn out spots to take a picture of the beautiful Emerald Bay if you go that way. There is great hiking around the Emerald Bay area also. 

In Incline, you can park at the Tunnel Creek Cafe and walk the trail along the lake to Sand Harbor. It‚Äôs around a 3 mile trail there and back. Or if your into mountain biking, you could rent mountain bikes at Tunnel Creek. They will drop you off at Spooner Lake where you will bike up to Marlette Lake. It then takes you around the Tahoe rim trail where you will get the most beautiful view of the lake. It eventually drops you right back at Tunnel Creek. This is probably one of the coolest things I have ever done in Tahoe, but it is not for the faint of heart. My favorite places to eat in Incline are Lupitas, if you like Mexican and Bite, which serves tapas style. Lone Eagle is a really nice steak house that is on the lake if you want fine dining. 

Taking a ski lesson would be really fun. Make sure you have appropriate clothing tho. You don‚Äôt want to ski in jeans. Your going to want snow clothes including gloves and eye protection. 

If hiking is what you are into, you could hike Mt. Rose Summit. It‚Äôs a 10 mile hike, so bring a lunch. It‚Äôs another place to get an amazing view of the lake, but it is considered a difficult trail. Also, people are not use to the elevation here, so be careful of elevation sickness if you are from sea level. I believe the elevation of Mt. Rose is close to 9,000 ft. 

For coffee, you could go to Java Hut in Kings Beach and then walk along the beach with it. Just please throw your garbage away. We have a major problem of tourists leaving garbage around. 

I seriously could go on and on with recommendations, so let me know if you have anymore questions.

"Use cable chains, they are ""easier"" to install and are better to drive a car on.




80 is ""easier"" with the new bypass in Truckee. I haven't used the bypass yet, it didn't exist when I was living up there. The other way on 89 is horrible. There's a ridge that will scare the hell out of you. It's 2 lanes, on a ridge with straight drops off both sides, no shoulder.






I like to take 50 but it's really f'ed up right now. I took that 2 weeks ago. It's down to one lane for both ways in some spots. The fires really destroyed things. 




It was the first snow of the year 2 Mondays ago, when I drove up, no snow in the forecast. The number of spin outs and crashes had us sitting on the summit for a few hours while they cleared the cars.





If you are not experienced at driving in snow, this is not the time or place to learn. Take a tour bus to the casinos would be my suggestion. I drive up there but I'm extremely experienced in snow.

"yeah, from South Lake, you're going to want to take Hwy 88 or 50 to Hwy 49 and go through Jackson. During the winter, many of the roads crossing the Sierra are closed because they aren't plowed in the winter. I just checked and Hwy 120 through the park is closed. I would expect Hwy 108 to also be closed

Earlier in the year, you needed a reservation to get in to YNP but not sure if that's needed now. Last I went, I think the entry fee was $25

If you're planning to stay there, you'll want to book in advance. The campgrounds book up quickly and well in advance. There are also hotel rooms & Airbnb in the park and just outside the park. I think if you get a campground, it includes a reservation to enter the park (but doesn't include the entry fee); not sure about the hotel room.

However you end up there, the place to start is Yosemite Valley. That's the famous part of the park that everyone goes to. It's well worth the trip. The other parts of the park are also amazing but can involve some hiking and are more spread out

Either park at your campground, hotel or the day use parking lot and then take the free Valley shuttle bus everywhere. Parking in the Valley is a pain and the bus saves a lot of headache and isn't really any slower

The Visitor's Center is a good place to start. Just ask the rangers there and they'll give you a list of hikes and tell you what roads are open in the park. Some of the hikes are close enough to the Visitor's Center that you can start there or you can take the shuttle bus

Clean out your car before you leave. If you leave any food in there (including crumbs) or anything that smells like it could be food (deodorant, gum, chapstick, etc), bears will literally rip the doors off your car to try to get the food. They don't hibernate in the winter. They are much more aggressive than any bear in South Lake

Also, there are a lot of great restaurants in-and-near heavenly village that often play live music.

* Many of the touristy bits are open now including emerald bay. There are also great restaurants and places to check out in-and-near heavenly village. Live music is a big thing here in Tahoe and many restaurants/bars have it every day. 
* For other recommended hikes, a slightly more challenging one that I recommend is the hike up to Marlette lake.

"Yes to all questions.

Winter is ski season around here, so I'd recommend checking out some of our world class ski resorts.  Even if you don't ski or don't like skiing, things like the tram at Olympic valley will offer activities and views.

Also be sure you know how to install chains on a car (like, not just watching a video but actually doing it).  It's much more stressful and difficult with frozen hands on the side of a frozen highway, so please make sure you're prepared should we get snow and you require chains.",t2_14fqsuly,AMW1234,0,1633629436.0,0,t1_hfr7nkk,hfr7nkk,True,[deleted],t3_q33n5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/laketahoe/comments/q33n5r/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/laketahoe/comments/q33n5r/deleted_by_user/hfr7nkk/,3,r/laketahoe,0,3

"I moved here two years ago and it was my first time ever living anywhere remotely snowy in the winter. I‚Äôve still found it pretty mild, however I‚Äôve been told that the last two winters have been really light in comparison to the norm. Maybe that means this one will be light too, maybe it means a big one is coming, that cant be said for sure. However, being someone who wasn‚Äôt used to snow or cold at all, I was totally fine the coldest days of the last two winters with leggings under jeans, a couple shirt layers, any type of hooded coat, and light gloves, hats, and scarves.

Also, if the main road is closed, don't try and use the side roads to get around the traffic stoppage. People die doing that.

"in the first week of January, I'd guess that the lows are going to be between -10 degF and 30 degF with a high in the 20 degF 45 degF range. So relatively cold but not as cold as some parts in the US

Heavy now is very possible and you should be prepared with snow chains. By heavy snow, it's not unheard of to get upwards of 6 ft of snow in a day

It is not uncommon for the highway to shutdown during that time of year, so your car should be prepared for that sort of emergency. This kit will include a lot of things, you should look up a list, but a shovel and sweeper would be two of those items

I live in Truckee so others would be better qualified to answer your questions about what to do.
