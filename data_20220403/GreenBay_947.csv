"St Brendan's is fantastic and on Saturday morning, the farmer's market happens right out the front door from 7 until noon, so it's a delightful morning all around, including live music, breakfast and fresh produce. There's decent nightlife on Washington Street, especially a block down closer to Wash and Walnut, but you can happily end up at St. Brendan's pub all night too. Hotel Northland is also nice and walkable to everything, plus there's a decent wine bar across the street (Aardvark).",t2_gvw20,13Thirteens,0,1649009755.0,0,t1_i392cpb,i392cpb,True,DN_1010wins,t3_tn8ek4,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/tn8ek4/hello_everyone_im_planning_a_guys_trip_to_green/,"Hello everyone, I'm planning a guys trip to Green Bay for the end of September beginning of October.

Second, Insurance would not deny your claim for even faulty diy wiring on a light or switch, save for if you have old wiring  like aluminum or if they could prove arson. Think about it, they would cover your house if you started an oil fire in your kitchen by accident, or overloaded a power strip and started a fire that way. 

Your response makes it seem like this is some serious work being done, but as long as it’s not very old wiring there isn’t much to worry about.

"He’s not particularly well-liked, but he’s objectively a better person than he’s portrayed to be by the local members of the Republican Party.

I ran against him & I knew him before he ran for office. I can tell you he’s a solid enough dude as a person to make you wonder why he’d ever get into politics until you get to know him a little bit better & then it is obvious.   

This is a smear-job that he doesn’t deserve, but he set himself up for by running for a non-partisan office as a Democrat.  That there are resources going into smearing him means the Republicans see him as someone who could be a viable candidate for higher office at some point in the future.  They definitely don’t feel the need to put their most effective operatives on it, though. 

The root of this is probably less about Eric than it is the need to keep VanderLeest occupied.

"I'm seconding Comedy City in De Pere (a suburb of Green Bay).  So much fun!  There's also fun restaurants and bars within walking distance of Comedy City.  If you like classic video games, Player 2 is a fun Barcade in downtown Green Bay.  Most games are pretty cheap, so it's a good place to knock back a few drinks and spend a few hours playing classic games.  Player 2 is also within walking distance of some great restaurants and a fantastic wine bar, Aardvark.

"You’re right. We’ve been getting these mailers saying the same thing about Barb Dorff. The Press Gazette had an article about these and to no surprise, they couldn’t speak directly with someone from the PAC behind this stuff (based in Chicago btw). Also, the article pointed out how all of the talking points on these mailers are out of context/false. 

Yes, the dark money is now infiltrating local elections and this is a prime example for Green Bay. Isn’t it interesting though, at the lengths those in power and gaming the system are going to keep things as corrupt as they are. Because that’s exactly the intent of this. 

One final point is the opponent of Barb Dorff spoke out against the mailers for these PACs as well. So in at least some cases, the actual local candidate that would benefit from the slander against their opponent isn’t even in on it. Scary stuff.

"From what I gather, it's been dirty, but at least it was kept locally for a while

It's gotten worse because It seems to me that there is some sort of movement to take over local government and school boards by openly MAGA/Qs (loose cannons and nutbars) over the CRT/Mask & Vax Mandates/LGBTQ+ issues that have been brought up- Most of the mailers I have seen haven't been from local groups and are of the extreme right winged variety with hateful messaging.

There's one even from PAC from Downers Grove, Illinois in support of a Green Bay candidate. Said candidate has quite the round of hateful social media posts that are the greatest hits from the right wing

Another one from Pewaukee, WI (Not local...) mudslinging another candidate...

Why does a group from  town in Illinois  need to support someone who is running for a local office several hours out? Why is Pewaukee getting their hands in this?

"I was one of the girls that had inappropriate contact with an appleton teacher. It’s not a conspiracy theory that the teachers union makes it impossible to get those scum bags fired without ‘video evidence’. I was rail roaded and when I went outside the school and filed a police report they placed him on paid leave for a few weeks while they investigated and surprise surprise he was back two weeks later. Luckily he retired a year later, but nothing ever came of it. 

I have a non-union job, and I don’t believe I would ever go union. There are zero benefits for me in my particular field. My bf is a union electrician, and other than his displeasure at sometimes (rarely) having to work with incompetent people or undertrained members, he loves it. 

I don’t hate the members, I think it’s exceedingly valueable to have unions (when they actually care about the workers over the companies that sponsor them) but I’ve personally never seen a union help a person that should have been helped. They keep incompetent people shielded and coverup issues to keep themselves squeaky clean, only doing anything of substance after an issue has reached a boiling point.

"If you don’t see the problem with being forced to fund and vocally support candidates that are diametrically apposed to your beliefs, then there is no reason to write out the paragraphs it would take to explain each point above.

But my personal experience with this, my father was in the pipe fitters union in 2015. When leadership found out he had a trump sticker on his truck (personal truck) he was ‘asked’ to remove it or they ‘might find he had violated regulations and place his membership under review while they investigated.’. Which would have prevented him from working for the duration of the investigation. (Which honestly would have only been a day or two, but at the time we couldn’t afford it, so he removed the sticker.)

"Just talked to a higher up there. They have been told they will be exploring early retirement packages for those affected, and are considering opening up the west side plant to be a union choice environment. 

Of course, the union won’t allow union choice, but it’s not like they are just telling the union to fuck off, which would be how I would handle it if I was in charge of the changes. 

Unions no longer serve the workers. They serve the companies that sponsor them and the Democratic Party. In 2016 over 35% of union dues from the day street plant went to democratic candidates. I know three people that specifically left the union and were moved to a different plant because of it. 

Anyone who promotes unions now is either Ill informed on the truth behind them, or understands that Unions have changed their focus in the last 40 years, and support that change.

Also if you’re into movies and physical media (there’s about a dozen of us) then PrePlayed has a great selection right now. They just put out a ton of movies. 

Karvana, Glas, The Attic, and Coffee Wizardz all have great coffee. Toast and Co, Black Cat White Dog (it’s renamed but i don’t remember if it’s just black cat or just white dog now) and The Creamery are all great spots for brunch.

"I’m sorry, my husband was supposed to go to that concert, too. 

Some recommendations: walk through the Titletown District (it is the off season but the restaurants are cool). Hinterland Brewing has great food. 

Even if you’re not a sports fan, the Packers pro shop is a must-see and is free to visit. Tours of Lambeau are under $20 and give you a behind the scenes look of club level seats, the rooftop, etc. 

Downtown Green Bay has a really nice historic district called the Broadway district with shops and restaurants ranging from casual to higher end. Downtown De Pere is cute to walk through, too, and has a great chocolate shop called Seroogy’s. 

I second what the person said about taking a drive up to Door County. Drive up to Sturgeon Bay and check out the downtown area around 1st and 2nd Street, lots of independent shops. Weather isn’t supposed to be great the next few days but if it clears up, take a scenic drive up Hwy 57 in Door County. Pretty views of the Bay.

"best food in green bay:
if you like indian: India Bhavan!!! it’s absolutely incredible, their vegetarian navratan khorma is one of the best things i’ve ever had. 

if you like mac n cheese: Macs. they’re just so scrumptious, and there are a lot of varieties to choose from.

caliente in de pere has really good mexican food!

bars:
player 2 is sooooo good. they have awesome food (mostly burgers and dank asf appetizers)
you can play their switch for free (just trade your drivers licenses for the controllers and then trade back when you’re done playin) 1st floor has skee ball and pinball and upstairs is allll retro arcade games, they’re cheap to play, all like .25-.50 and if you go on wednesday it’s 2 for 1 tokens!

rabbit hole has a cool little upstairs cozy bar space, very neat.

tundra lodge has a water park and access to it is only like 17$ on fridays, haven’t checked it out myself but it’s definitely on the to do list fs.

the marcus theaters around are super cozy and fun! there’s also a cinema in de pere that serves alcohol and pizza and it’s lovely.",t2_ef1tkw6r,m4sterofdarkarts,0,1647932296.0,0,t1_i1mt9mc,i1mt9mc,True,muggleincendio,t3_tjw1ol,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/tjw1ol/things_to_do_in_green_bay/,Things to do in Green Bay??,/r/GreenBay/comments/tjw1ol/things_to_do_in_green_bay/i1mt9mc/,15,r/GreenBay,0,15
"Check out a comedy city show (improv) at the Green Room in depere, or take the 30 minute drive to a comedy show at Skyline in Appleton.

Hit up Lambeau field, take tour or just mosey about around the Packer District behind it.

Bar hop - there's a LOT of them. Stadium View and Anduizzes will have a louder crowd on Friday nights, but I highly recommend Slander for their specialty drinks and a chill environment. 

I believe the Foxy Pedelar is open now too, which is great but maybe better with a bigger group. Depends on how outgoing you are. 

Eat! Lots of good food and the cheesecurds are a must. Check out the Depot, or the Distillery, or Hinterland for some easy recommendations.

"So for those wondering:

  
I just searched and this is a screenshot of the Democratic Party of Brown County spring election voter guide, found [here](https://brown.wiscdems.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Spring2022VoterGuide_web.pdf).

  
At the bottom of the voter guide it says this:  
*Does not reflect an official party endorsement. List includes members and non-member leaders in select contested races. Compiled using publicly available information. Candidates have not given their express permission to be included. Omission from this guide does not necessarily mean the candidate is a conservative. (I) means incumbent. Opponents with red flags have known Republican affiliations. Two red flags means the opponent has demonstrated support for the Big Lie.*

"Like I said, save your energy for those real  conversations. If you're truly an independent and value objectivity, you'll find that the right is taking this county in the wrong direction. Conservatives I admire held to values that no longer seem to matter - accountability, liberty, small government to name a few. Your billionaire class? These are manufactured by GOP policies that preserve wealth in that tier. Yes, the Dems are weak when it comes to Wall St. demands - we've seen this. Look at the education policies the GOP have espoused - how their budget cuts have killed public schools while siphoning money into private (mostly religious) schools. 

About two-thirds of independents dislike Biden because he isn't leaning far enough one way or another. That's another issue but one that implies ""independents"" aren't as much so as they claim. That middle third is going to hold their breath until the Presidential election. How does this affect local votes? In the local primaries, we saw progressives winning and seditionists lose. We'll see more of them lose in April because ultimately more people see the danger of electing traitors as worse than candidates who value a good education, voting accessibility, and a clean environment. 

In all seriousness, enjoy canvassing.

Did Biden cause inflation? Not entirely. While his relief packages added money to the economy, that money was needed to prevent families from falling further into poverty.

"During the biden administration, something like 20 new billionaires have arisen. Inflation is at 7% all of last year and is almost at 8% this year. Under trump it never hit 2.5%. 

Gas prices have are almost double what they were at the highest point under trump. This literally only affects people who are middle class and lower. 

Foods prices are up 5-50% nation wide.

Did trump make income inequality worse? Yeah, by a small amount. He certainly didn’t push it in the right direction, but under Biden it has EXPLODED.

"I've been to ~25 or so fish places in Green Bay including all the ones mentioned, and by far my favorite is Parker John's. On fridays, they have all-you-can-eat beer-battered Haddock and cornmeal-crusted Catfish for $15, and both are phenomenal! Also, the other components of the meal: fries, coleslaw, Cajun tartar sauce & honey-covered cornbread are excellent quality. 

Personally, I didn't think Redwood Inn was worth the 2.5 hour wait, and I think Perch is low-quality in terms of flavor, so a few other options on here I am not big on. St. Brendan's Inn has good fish & chips, otherwise, I really like the Walleye at Rocky Z's!

You are doing good with the trump hysteria but I think you need to step it up in other areas.   It’s been effective to label people who you may disagree with  with random terms.  Whether it’s valid or makes any sense at all is irrelevant.   For example…. If some one were to say they wanted to secure the southern border to cut back on drugs and crime the thing to do is call them a white nationalist nazi.   Another example is if someone were to say they have concerns with biological males competing in women’s sports or using women’s bathrooms/locker rooms just call them a transphobic bigoted fascist.   Hopefully you get the idea but if you need more help just let me know.

They open at 6am on Sat and Sunday.  Brand new gym, Brand new decal in window saying 24/7. In Dec they switch to this, saying they can't find help, but it's March now and same hours.  And when you get there on weekends, you see the employees looking out the window seeing how many cars are out there waiting for them to open up. Don't know why they can't open early if employees are there. They wait right till 6. Also seems like they have huge turn around as far as employees, maybe if they paid them more than 10 bucks an hour, they would stay.

Complaint: Green Bay woman dismembered man’s body, placed head in bucket  


  
GREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Officers found a severed head in a bucket at a home on Green Bay’s west side and body parts in other locations in scenes reminiscent of a gory horror movie.

  
Taylor D. Schabusiness, 24, is charged with 1st Degree Intentional Homicide, Mutilating a Corpse and 3rd Degree Sexual Assault. A court commissioner set her bond at $2 million cash at a hearing Tuesday afternoon. Schabusiness seemed calm when she appeared in Brown County court via video conference. She said very little, only acknowledging that she has the right to an attorney.  


  
The prosecutor called this “one of the most serious offenses we’ve had in this county in some time.” The state argued Schabusiness has ties to Texas, raising a concern she’s a flight risk. The prosecution also said Schabusiness was on put on probation 7 weeks before the crime and supposed to be wearing an electronic monitoring bracelet but apparently removed it somehow.  


  
“I think the facts alleged are extremely concerning and disturbing and go to the violent nature and grave nature of the offense,” Assistant District Attorney Caleb Saunders said in court.  


  
We first told you last Wednesday about a suspicious death investigation underway on Green Bay’s west side on the 800-block of Stony Brook Lane. The criminal complaint goes into detail, saying on Feb. 23, at about 3:25 A.M., police were called to the home by a person living there who reported finding her son’s severed head in a bucket.

  
The woman told police she heard a door slam between 2 and 3 A.M., waking her. She went to check on a light left on downstairs and made the gruesome discovery.  


  
Dried blood was found on a nearby mattress.  


  
Police learned that Taylor Schabusiness may have been the last person to be seen with the victim, identified only as a 25-year-old man. They found her at a home on Eastman Avenue. She had dried blood on her clothing.  


  
Police searched Schabusiness’s van and on the rear passenger seat. They found a crock pot box with “additional human body parts including legs,” according to the criminal complaint.  


  
Police obtained a search warrant for the home on Stony Brook Lane, which belonged to the victim’s mother. In addition to the human head, they found a “male organ” in the bucket. They found “body fluid” and knives.  


  
In a storage tote, they found an upper torso.  


  
Police interviewed Schabusiness and asked her what happened. She replied, “That is a good question.” Schabusiness said she and the victim were together all day Tuesday and had been smoking meth. After they arrived at the Stony Brook home, they were having sex and incorporated chains. Schabusiness said she blacked out during part of it but just went “crazy” and started strangling the victim.  


  
Schabusiness told investigators she did not mean to kill the victim but she enjoyed choking him and continued to do it. Prosecutors say the sexual assault charge is for acts that happened after the victim died.  


  
“Schabusiness responded that the police were going to have fun trying to find all of the organs as she dismembered the body. Schabusiness stated all of the body parts should be in the basement. Schabusiness stated there should be a foot or a leg in the minivan. Detective Graf asked Schabusiness what she did with the head, and Schabusiness stated she had put the Victim’s head in a black bucket and put a blanket over it,” reads the criminal complaint.  


  
The complaint continues, “Schabusiness stated she used knives that she obtained from the kitchen of the residence and that a bread knife worked the best because of the serrated blade. Schabusiness stated the knives should be in a black bag along with the body parts in the basement. Schabusiness indicated that she would use whatever bags she found in the basement to place the body parts into. Schabusiness made the comment that at one point, she did get paranoid and lazy and that she thought it was the ‘dope’ that was making her paranoid.”  


  
“Schabusiness stated the plan was for her to bring all of the body parts with her but she got lazy and only ended up putting the leg/foot in the van and she forgot the head,” reads the complaint.  


  
Police, forensic teams and the Dane County Medical Examiner’s Office investigated and processed multiple locations associated with the crime.  


  
Police met with the victim’s family Tuesday. Officials have not released the victim’s name but are asking for privacy for his family.

"Agreed. And [The People's Flag of Milwaukee](https://milwaukeeflag.com/) has a lot of well thought out symbolism built into the design.

> The centered disc represents the sun rising over the horizon of Lake Michigan, as seen while looking East from the shore of the city. The sunrise symbolizes hope and a new day. Universally, the color white represents peace and unity. To many Milwaukeeans, this color has also come to symbolize our long winters.
> 
> The three stripes in the sun's reflection represent the founders of Milwaukee and its three original settlements: Kilbourn Town, Juneau Town and Walker's Point. Their light blue color symbolizes our three rivers: Milwaukee, Menomonee, and Kinnickinnic.
>

"I guess. 

I was expelled as a kid, in the very early aughts, around 2001. It was a complicated, stupid situation where I was threatened with a gun so I gave all the methylphenidate I used to be on to some kids I thought were my friends. When they got caught, they said I gave it to them and so I was expelled for the remainder of the year for ""not coming forward."" I went to a special school for kids with mental issues who got expelled, and kids who were removed from that school were referred to rawhide. Several kids there had been to rawhide before and said there was sexual abuse and physical abuse taking place there. a quick googling supports that not only was sexual abuse documented a while before that, [but also that they are extremely anti-LGBTQ.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawhide_Boys_Ranch#cite_note-46)

"Van Rite charged us 5K four years ago for a typical residential house 40 feet from the street. Our house had the original clay pipe sewer that had joints about every 4 feet. Van Rite uses an interesting method called pipe bursting. The advantage is they don't have to excavate a trench through the entire yard. Instead, they dig a hole inside your basement to expose the interior sewer line, then dig another hole at the street where it meets the municipal sewer line. A cable is then inserted into the old sewer pipe, and that cable pulls a new flexible plastic pipe through the old one, using it as a conduit to guide the new plastic pipe and ""burst"" apart the old clay one. They also pulled a new 1"" Pex fresh water supply line at the same time to replace our old galvanized supply, as well as installed a sewer backflow valve in the basement, which is standard for modern homes (the insurance companies also want to see this). The whole job was done in a day from 7am to 6pm.

It is expensive, but our concern was that it could have been *more* expensive given the 100-year old age of our house. The continuing root blockage problem was annoying. But if that old clay sewer pipe ever collapsed, we wouldn't have been able to use their pipe bursting method. Then we would have had to excavate a trench, which would have also meant paying to remove the huge tree in the front yard causing the problem, as well as probably disassemble some or all of the front porch. We chose to do it as a proactive project, rather than waiting for it to become an emergency, which no doubt would have added to the cost.

In hindsight, the only thing I probably would have done different is to have done it when we first bought the house, and wrapped the cost into the new mortgage at that time.",t2_98ids,lemming_follower,0,1645974854.0,0,t1_hyngn49,hyngn49,False,nightwing185,t3_swe085,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/swe085/emergency_plumbers/,Emergency plumbers?,/r/GreenBay/comments/swe085/emergency_plumbers/hyngn49/,2,r/GreenBay,0,2

"Dr. Geaudry at Packerland Veterinary Center has always been my go-to for exotic/small pets. 

She treated my illness-prone bunny from his first checkup after adopting him through multiple surgeries and until he passed away of old age, happily free of the ailments that plagued him in his younger years. 

I've taken several rabbits, two hedgehogs, two chinchillas, and even a mouse to her over the years, and she has never steered me wrong.

"First welcome to the Green Bay Area. I’m a lifelong resident (51 years old) and I’ve lived in the areas where some people have told you to avoid. My son and sister live on the west side near West High School and both have beautiful old houses and have wonderful neighbors. Also they paid great prices for these houses so not sure if you’re looking for bargains. I live in the Astor neighborhood which is east side of downtown and love it as well. Lots of old houses loaded with character. My kids all went to public and private schools so if you’re not happy with the GB public schools you have options.(when you have kids.) my sister mother and in laws all
Live in Allouez a nice area as well. Went to college in DePere and again a great area. One area that others didn’t mention is Howard and Suamico. So basically you have lots of options as I think we have a great area and I think the people here are great. Like everything nothings perfect but Milwaukee, Madison ,CHicago and even Minneapolis are not far away for the big city experience. Also our neighbors to the south of us like Appleton and the rest of the Fox River Valley have lots of nice things to do. Lastly while all these areas we’ve been talking about are great options we’ve been house shopping with our son and I was amazed how hard and competitive it was to find one and we were specifically looking for a older starter house in the “tough” neighborhoods.

"In terms of East vs West De Pere, they’re both nice suburban areas, with a few main differences:

East De Pere is primarily residential, with the exception of the downtown area along the river where most of the shops and restaurants are located. As you get to the fringes of town, it bleeds into farmland and new subdivisions. You’re close to the stores in Bellevue (target, Costco, groceries, home improvement, restaurants, etc). The biggest plus for East De Pere is that it has excellent access to both the Fox River Trail and the East River trail if you enjoy running or biking. 

West De Pere has St Norbert College and a lot more businesses. There are still nice residential areas in West De Pere, but student housing bleeds into some of the neighborhoods in the city proper. There are a lot more stores and businesses around than there are in East De Pere, which means you’re closer to amenities but it’s busier and less peaceful. The outskirts of West De Pere bleed into a lot commercial real estate surrounding highway 41, so it’s definitely higher traffic, but it also makes it a lot faster and more convenient to travel south on 41.",t2_38m5rd4p,2manyemilys,0,1645745230.0,0,t1_hyb5thr,hyb5thr,True,superzippy1,t3_t0k84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/t0k84k/just_another_question_about_where_to_live_de_pere/,"Just another question about where to live, De Pere?

"One point of clarification from the post above - Oneida street has a lot on it, in terms of chains. It's where the mall is, and it's where things like Old Chicago, Qdoba, LongHorn, IHOP, etc. are, and then yes you'll eventually get to Lambeau field and a few great sports bars.   
Broadway is where you'll find more of the unique ""city-life"" types of high end restaurants, bars, and unique shops (I highly recommend Slander, try the GunPowder for a unique drink you can't get anywhere else). 

There are places you can rent right on the river near broadway, but honestly I think they are a bit overpriced when traversal in GB is really a none-issue. You can get anywhere in Green Bay in about 10 minutes.   


I've lived in Green Bay (East side), Allouez, and Bellevue. I personally like Bellevue a lot because there's some very nice neighborhoods and most of it is pretty close to basically any store you'll need. I'm a 3 minutes drive from 2 grocery stores, a Target, plenty of quick-eat options, and 3 different home improvement stores.   


Having that all been said, a lot of people prefer the De Pere area, and it has a GREAT park and access to the fox river trail for running/biking. There really isn't much of a difference between the East and West sides. 

Ashwaubenon and Green Bay, from a home-buying perspective have a lot of lower income homes (not that there aren't nice areas though), but if Money isn't an issue, Bellevue, De Pere, or even Hobart and Howard (if you're willing to up that commute to 15-20minutes) have better properties.",t2_abm37,Burdicus,0,1645737638.0,0,t1_hyam5dg,hyam5dg,False,superzippy1,t3_t0k84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/t0k84k/just_another_question_about_where_to_live_de_pere/,"Just another question about where to live, De Pere?

"I can't give too much info, there are areas that are both good and bad. I hear things here and there. I don't want to throw insults based on news stories when I haven't lived there to experience the areas. I feel like in the past decade, a few shootings and stabbings have happened on the east side. I only paid attention to that because I worked near those incidents. I would see if you can find crime maps to check for sure, I could be wrong.

Edit: I was talking about Green Bay, not De Pere.",t2_20s04t80,AnotherScottaRama,0,1645737009.0,0,t1_hyakfsx,hyakfsx,False,superzippy1,t3_t0k84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/t0k84k/just_another_question_about_where_to_live_de_pere/,"Just another question about where to live, De Pere?

"Ashwaubenon is pretty much where the ""hot spots"" are. The mall, a bunch of restaurants, basically Oneida st is where most of the big business stuff is, plus down the road into west Green Bay is the stadium district.

Allouez is just on the opposite side of the river and is more of a village area where there aren't a ton of businesses, but mostly houses and a few parks.

DePere has a bit of main businesses on the east and west side of the bridge area, otherwise both sides of the river are pretty nice to live.

Green Bay is kind of a ""it depends on the neighborhood"" for what you are looking for, so I will let someone else fill you in on that.",t2_20s04t80,AnotherScottaRama,0,1645734208.0,0,t1_hyacu9p,hyacu9p,True,superzippy1,t3_t0k84k,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/t0k84k/just_another_question_about_where_to_live_de_pere/,"Just another question about where to live, De Pere?

"Well, I'd LOVE to lay it all at his feet, but in reality his shambolic incompetence was just one of many contributing factors. 

The point is that societal pressure is extremely high right now and historically periods of high tension such as this produce increased crime rates, at least going by the crime data we have for the last 100 years or so.",t2_3l0xw,gedvondur,0,1645728502.0,0,t1_hy9xn0l,hy9xn0l,False,[deleted],t3_t01bwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GreenBay/comments/t01bwb/another_murder/,Another murder?,/r/GreenBay/comments/t01bwb/another_murder/hy9xn0l/,10,r/GreenBay,0,10
