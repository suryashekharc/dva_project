"Kimberly, Greenville, and Grand Chute are all great places to settle down. I've lived in a few different places in Wisconsin and none of them can compare to the Fox Cities area, especially Appleton and its surrounding villages. You'll feel comfortable and safe living in any of those neighborhoods. And the people vibe is amazing compared to southern WI, cashiers make eye contact and try to make small talk with you, people hold doors open for you, etc. Good vibe overall. One big question is, how important is it to you to be near ""civilization"" or ""activity,"" because once you start looking at Greenville and further away you're starting to look at a 10 minute commute just to arrive at something more interesting than the local ice cream joint or kids' baseball league game. Also I went to the Hortonville school district a *cough* decade or two ago *cough* and it was awesome... amazing band department, lots of teachers who cared, none of those problems that big cities have like needing metal detectors or anything.

"There isn't frequent MAJOR mass reductions, but they do happen. 2019 was the last big one I remember, they cut maybe a hundred folks, but offered relocation to other shops. Previously, they would do facilities projects to keep folks busy, (paint hangar walls, 6S the back shops, etc) but when I left, Savannah was removing a lot of authority from individual repair stations, and their universal policies don't always make sense across the fleet. The folks out on the floor are great, they are either skilled at advanced techniques, (composites, aerodynamic smoothing, etc) or eager to learn more about them. The back shops, (cabinetry, upholstery, etc) are excellent craftsmen, and the engineers and tools are some of the easiest accessed I've seen in 20 years. But... if you're new to business aviation, it's another animal, and if you're coming from Part 135, Part 145 work was really hard to get used to. The aircraft are state of the art, but not designed with maintenance in mind, and management is mostly well-intentioned, though they don't have authority to change anything. Gulfstream takes a certain type of person to enjoy it, it isn't tough to enjoy, but most of the folks I knew there are either out of there in a year, or they are there for a career. Benefits are middle of the road, nothing great or awful, uniforms are provided, and the new MRO facility is nice, with team tools rather than individual tool boxes, and excellent parts/tools support. FlightSafety schools are usually offered after a year of tenure, though you can volunteer for smaller, more specific classes put on throughout the year. Last bit of advice- if you want to learn and advance, take a first shift job. If you want the most days off, but mostly floorboards and fuel panels, take weekend shift. 2nd shift has a good crew, with visibility by leadership to be remembered for cool classes and big jobs, but it's so easy to forget about weekend shift, that you end up falling into low-stakes busy work, because you're so often grabbed to move aircraft for an entire afternoon, and can't be relied on to get meaningful work done, since the drop-ins show up on Friday night, and need all hands to get it done. Overall, the work wasn't my cup of tea, but they are still a good outfit, with some really smart techs than can teach a lot of new techniques you won't find anywhere else, even if it often is for tax write off hangar queens.

There were some unrelated shootings the last few years, but that is really, really rare.

"Hey, I moved here from Denver about a year and a half ago, will you be my friend?! lol. It's not very often you come across someone that moves here from Colorado, it's usually the other way around, so forgive my excitement to see your post. 

Anyways, Mexican food is different out here and so far I havent really come across anywhere that does breakfast burritos like what you're looking for. However, I do have a couple of recommendations for Mexican food in general. Antojitos is our favorite ""fancy"" Mexican food; if you've ever been to Machete in the Denver area, this place is probably the closest thing you're going to find. They do margarita flights and they are awesome.

If you're looking for authentic Mexican like what you find off of federal Blvd, then you'll have to venture out to New London of all places. There's this new restaurant that opened up called El Patron and their food is really good for how small of a place it is. It's the only place that I know that has menudo, so if that's any indicator of how authentic the place is, then there you have it.

Homeless and addicts already flock to these places without my posting of these locations. I do not remember mentioning anything about the HVAC. u/HOWDY__YALL already explained what Urbex means. This definitely is not a list for displaced people I think they would rather sleep outside due to the excessive black mold in all these buildings. The only one without mold really is the CVS and that's about 2500 ft away from a homeless shelter.

The Chase bank I agree with when I visited it was around 2:00 in the morning and someone had smashed a window out about a month prior. Although as of about a week ago it got repaired. The Theatre they seemed to have given up on as Police and Fire crews aren't permitted to go inside due to the overwhelming black mold.

"I know it wasn't your analogy, but you said it works in your favor and tried to pretend it did, of course I've been to a doctor and the experts should know best so why would I try to tell them what I need fixed??

That was my bad about the agenda comment, I saw your reply and someone agreed with you talking about an agenda being pushed and thought it was you.

 Notice the quotes around ""have a say"" it's people like you twisting it like that, it's not ""I want to know what my kids are learning and I can encourage them to add more stuff to their curriculum"" it's more of ""I don't believe they should be learning that despite it being true and helpful in life"". 

There has been multiple laws proposed in other states where teachers can get fined for teaching certain subjects, like stuff that goes against the bible, racism, LGBT, socialism, or even speaking negatively of Nazis (indiana). This tweet is definitely about parents wanting laws in place so they can control their child's education to make it fit their beliefs, not about being apart of their education in a beneficial way.

Tbh I don't even think the ""move to private schools or home school"" is a valid opinion because by changing the education from what everyone gets to something else, you are most likely hurting them in the long run. Alot of private schools don't teach alot of sex ed and throwing grown adults into society without knowing how everything works down there is a problem. 

Majority of things taught in schools are facts. Yeah some teachers will give their opinion and I think kids having healthy decisions would be smart in schools but what ""say in my kids education"" do you want other than going again these facts.

It’s not my medical analogy it was the person I was responding to.  If you take your kid to the doctor you absolutely have a say in their care.  I’m guessing you aren’t a parent and/or have never been to a doctor.  Can you point out where i said anything about schools pushing an agenda or the rest of your soap box rant that has little to do with the topic at hand.  Read her tweet again if you need to.   Her point is that if you want to have a say in your child’s education you should send them to private school or home school. So tax paying parents should pay more for private school if they want to have a say in their child’s education?   What if they can’t afford it?   Does the luxury of having a say in your child’s education only belong to those who can afford it?   No surprise I guess from the intolerant left….

"If you don’t believe in science in school, you should not have a say.

If you think religion has any place in school, you should not have a say.

If history, and all the bad things that have been done in the past, get you angry for being taught. You do not have a say.

School is a place to teach kids critical thinking skills. We have devolved to the point where schools are only teaching what is on the tests that gauge the effectiveness of the school. If a kid just can memorize the facts without any context or theory behind it…what have they learned?

If you as a parent feel uncomfortable about a subject or disagree with what is being taught, you should and can speak up. However, if the majority of educators and the surrounding public think that you’re a whack job and an idiot….whelp, you may be wrong.

So Snodgrass walked her comment back and said parents should have say in their child’s education.   Do you disagree with her on that or just assume she is lying?  Maybe you should reach out to her and demand she change her later latest stance and flip flop again.

">Appleton is less homophobic and more racist. That's the hidden truth. 

Until fairly recently, Appleton and the Fox Cities were *very* predominantly white and Hmong. Over the last thirty years or so, more and more black, Latino, and (non-Hmong) Asian people have moved here, and the racism bit is *slowly* improving. Prejudiced people become less prejudiced when they spend time with people from whatever demographic they're prejudiced against. As residents end up spending more time in the company of other groups, at least *some* of these issues should continue to improve.

Edit: something else I remembered, Wisconsin used to have *a lot* of sundown towns

>I lived here 31 years. Spent 14 additional living in Minneapolis. Waaaaay different level of acceptance and culture out there compared back when I moved in 99. When I came back in 2014, the fox valley mellowed out quite a bit.

"God is fake, ancient people wanted something to believe in to explain what was unexplainable to them.

There is 0 evidence Jesus of Nazareth ever existed. There is 0 evidence Moses ever existed. Historical records show that the Jews were never enslaved by the Egyptians. The Bible contradicts itself so regularly that even the source material of Christianity is unreliable. 

Everything about Christianity is a copy of older religions. God as you know it comes from Judaism. Jesus comes from the Helcenic religions and mimics the entire life of Dionysus who is 2,000 years older than Jesus. 

God the creator of the universe and savior of all mankind only showed himself to a small nation in the Middle East 2,000 years ago and never again? 

I studied latin, memorized word for word all four series of the Baltimore catechism, served as the MC in the nations largest pilgrimage Latin mass for 6 years, and was preparing for seminary. Was a regular speaking guest of the Marian Hour the countries most popular radio rosary broadcast for a decade. 

And everything I know, and everything I've learned... God is not real and the popularization of religion was strictly to control people. Governments weren't effective at maintaining order and controlling populaces in areas that they did not reside or have a strong presence so they needed religion to control those people. This is why ancient empires always work so closely with the church. 

Now governments and law are much more effective and we've separated Church from State because the church is no longer needed to control those people because the law is so effective. Thus the decline of religion and the belief in God.",t2_8o5tv,Siex,0,1642369363.0,0,t1_hsycq74,hsycq74,False,[deleted],t3_s5i1jx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Appleton/comments/s5i1jx/walmart_cruel_beligerent_appleton/,WAL-MART ...

"Have you thought about switching careers? I'm looking into Salesforce myself. Yeah CO is really expensive. I wouldn't be able to live here if it weren't for my partner being in tech. The weather (minus the summer) is really nice here for sure - so mild! I'm glad you were able to enjoy it for the time you have been here. 

Yeah the housing prices are what got me looking into Appleton. I couldn't believe how affordable they were and they looked really nice too (not run down like a lot of cheaper cities). I would like to retire early if possible and I don't need a lot of things I'm finding, even though I'm from a large city. I care about grocery stores, libraries, parks, some natural areas, trees, coffee shops. I have heard Door County is nice and it looks like Appleton isn't far from the UP either.

We are looking at the upper Midwest since we don't think CO is the best place for climate change (drought & wildfires). Appleton is actually in the Great Lakes Basin as well.

"Hey!  I think the heart of the matter is that I simply didn’t set myself up well in life to live in any area outside of my regional company I worked for back in Appleton.  

The cost of living is a bit more here in Colorado, but again, it was my own responsibility for not putting myself in a position to be able to better afford my family and myself being able to live here.  But otherwise, CoSprings is quite lovely and I wish I would’ve came to a more positive conclusion about this place earlier.  The weather this time of the year will be missed greatly when I’m back in Appleton this time next winter.  Being able to be out in a thin shirt in the afternoons in January and feel perfectly comfortable has been amazing!  Just as it had been to enjoy all the trails and such here, too.

Depending on how much you love being in a bigger Metro area like Denver, you might find Appleton to be a boring, but that all comes down to individual tastes and temperament, but… if you’re selling a house in the Denver area and buying in Appleton, you should be able to set yourself up very nicely financially as houses seem to be about 1/2 to 1/3 less in Appleton versus CO these days.  And there is trails and nature stuff to do, nothing as exciting as ascending a mountain and jogging down a switchback… although some lakeshore views (Door County) can still take your breath away in awe in a different manner.

The lady deleted her comment because she didn't know the CDC allows vaccinated people sick with covid to come back to work.

People get sick from covid, the flu, the common cold, it happens it's no cause for alarm.

Also check your facts.. hospitals aren't overwhelmed they're understaffed. And they're understaffed because we terminated a good portion of workers for not being vaccinated.

If you'd stop watching CNN or sitting in your echo chamber of regurgitation sensationalized news you would realize you got caught up in the hype.

Hospitalization figures are no higher than any other year... Unless you count last year the peak of covid was actually our lowest hospitalization rate in the last 20 years. 

But, you were led to believe things were bad last year and you believed it... The reality was it was our least hospitalized year in the longest time. 

Chris Cuomo from CNN after he got fired even made a public statement that CNN was intentionally hyping up covid to scare people because they wanted to get Donald Trump out of office...

"I grew up near Appleton, in a town called Harrison , on the N shore of Lake Winnebago. I went to West HS. I’m currently living in West Hollywood, but have been back numerous times - my parehts still have their home there. 

I would say Appleton is a tad more conservative than it is liberal, but it has changed A Lot m, for the better since the 9o’s LOL. Some areas are almost completely unfamiliar like Darboy and the North side. 

There are many great areas to live in the Fox Cities. But my least favorite is Menasha, or as friends used to call it… Metrasha LOL . 

The towns along the Eastern shore of Winnebago are small but are gorgeous in the summer- Sherwood, chilton , hilbert. 

The school system is great & it’s pretty safe everywhere. My least fav part of Appleton is near West HS , maybe it’s just old memories but I find it depressing. My fav part is along the river but those homes are probably the most expensive in the city. Neenah has some gorgeous homes as well by the Bergstrom museum .

A lot of people drink heavily and live the Packers. But 97% of people in WI are very nice, and even strangers will have conversations with you - not like LA lol.

Just make sure to have a very warm jacket, an ice scraper, snow tires, and stick up on mosquito repellent- they were absolutely brutal this past summer.

There are plenty of nice gyms in the area… crunch gym , planet fitness, lake park fitness and tons a f great parks. High cliff is awesome as well. 

In the summer it’s fun to take the SS badger in manitowoc over to MI. I’d recommend checking out crystal lake in MI for a vacation - it’s absolutely stunning.

Lake Winnebago is nice for kayaking on a calm day , but it can get very green and stinky . Like really stinky . 

The downtown area is cute and Lawrence university campus is beautiful.

The whole covid fear mongering is falling apart, and even Liberal Democrats are preparing people for the new ""we're going to have to live with covid"" narrative and down playing it's severity that they hyped up for the past two years.

Edit:

Also I'm still going to eat at draft. I love that place. I don't care if the manager made a couple girls cry... Boo hoo.

"Making friends over 25 over just seems more difficult, but Wisconsin is very much beer culture, so the craft beer scene is an option (mcfleishmans is a great brewery or a new one just opened north side of town).  Lots of bars downtown are clearly college bars after a certain time but you'll be able to tell pretty quickly.  

Otherwise maybe join sports leagues/groups (like volleyball or ultimate frisbee or biking) or meeting people through pets or through volunteering.

420 seems common enough once you get to know people, but hard to meet people that way since it's still illegal in the state.
