"So, it depends how long you're able to wait at the Canyon. The longer you're able to stay there, the better your chances. You go there and get a waitlist number, and then show up in the morning to see if your place in line gets called. If not, you go back the next day, and the next. Suppose you get number 6, and in the morning, they take 1, 2, and 3. You won't get one that morning, but you keep your place in line. So you go the next morning and they call 4, 5 and 6. You get your permit. Whoever has 7 will get theirs the next morning. I've heard that if you're there 3-4 days you're probably getting a permit, but that's longer than most people can wait. IMPORTANTLY - get your waitlist number as soon as you get to the park as long as the BCO is open. It doesn't have to be in the morning to pick that up.  

Other things - keep an eye on [this link](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/upload/CorAvail.pdf). They update this once or twice a month - if you see a spot that works for you, apply immediately via fax. Consider off corridor campgrounds if your experience level is good enough, but make sure you understand things like if there's water available or not.

"If you haven’t already booked a spot: Camp for free just south of the park entrance. Forest road 302, for example. Goes east from just below Tusayan for several miles. Not glamorous but plenty of options and very close to the park. Camping at Desert View Campground, within the Park itself, can be crowded but the location is spectacular. One of the best views from the South Rim of The Canyon is from a trail that extends NE from the camp to the Rim. 

When you’re in the park, if you’re in somewhat decent shape, I’d strongly recommend a hike into the Canyon, at least a little bit… Don’t hike into the Canyon if there is snow (unless you have spikes), as the steep trails can become a slippery ice. Maybe the South Kaibab Trail to Ooh Aah Point and back? Or maybe down Bright Angel Trail to the 1.5 Mile Resthouse (1000 feet elevation loss) or the 2 mile switchback, or even the three mile guesthouse (about 2000 feet down) if you want to push yourself for a better view. It’s a different world within the Canyon itself. To go all the way to the bottom in a day is way way too much for most people. The Bright Angel Trail I wouldn’t consider scary for most people as the trail is wide enough to let two encumbered mules pass one another. Steep drop offs but, in my estimation at least, a safe trail. South Kaibab to Ooh Aah is also not sketchy for a non-acrophobic. 

The Rim trail is still awesome, if that’s all you’re down for. All the major points on the south Rim are worth seeing and you can hit most of them in a single day. You’ll need a shuttle to visit some of them much of the year (maybe all year, I dunno these days) 

If you plan on also hitting Flagstaff and If you have a lot of extra time, doing the loop (in South/main entrance and out SE entrance of the Park and onward to the 89 down to Flag) will give you a great sense of the geography of a large chunk of Northern Arizona, As that’ll have you journey past the San Francisco Peaks (tallest Mountains in AZ) from the north, and give you just a little taste of Navajo Reservation… as wall as having you pass Wupatki/Sunset Crater National Park (which I think is worth a visit) before you reach Flagstaff.

I recommend driving over to the desert watch tower that's on the east side of the park. It'll give a different view of the canyon. It's so big that walking a short distance doesn't change too much of the overall view.

"Tanner doesn't have much in the way of exposure (as in, a misstep would throw you off a cliff).  The stretches through the Coconino and Redwall layers aren't easy, but I don't think they're dangerous (other redditors please chime in with your thoughts).

From Tanner Rapids, if you head east on Beamer you see some pretty serious exposure -- NPS labels that trail as ""not recommended for people with a fear of heights"". If you head west from Tanner Rapids, the sketchy parts are Papago Wall and Papago Slide, but if you just day hike over from Tanner Rapids to Escalante Canyon or Seventyfive Mile Canyon the trail is pretty straightforward and you won't have to deal with any of that.

I personally find the stretch of GC around Tanner (e.g., from Tanner west  to Seventyfive Mile Canyon) some of the prettiest in the Canyon.  Unlike the area near the corridor trails, you don't have the big black Vishnu Schist cliffs by the river -- instead, the red layers (technically, the Supergroup Formation) come all the way down to the water, and it's just gorgeous.

"You could do that, most people hike the loop from Hermit to IG, though. It depends on where you want to start the hike. If you start at Hermit’s Rest and hike to Granite Rapid, that’s a 10-11 mile day if I remember right; if you started at Bright Angel Trailhead it would be 18 miles. (Tonto trail is not steep but it also isn't flat! When we did Granite Rapid to IG, that was a 13 mile day with 3000 feet of gain, starting with the climb out of Monument. Then we were at 3100 feet after that, and IG is at 3800, and we still had around 2300 feet of gain after Monument, if that gives you an idea of how much up and down there is on the trail.) For camping at Hermit, put Hermit Creek as your second choice and try to get Hermit Rapid. That’s a great campsite. There’s campsites at Crystal Spring, Salt Creek, and Horn Creek, but no drinkable water at any of them, so those are all dry camps.

"Well, the roads are all paved and maintained well so you won't have any issues with having to drive on forest roads.   And it's almost always breezy at the canyon.  Though there are some impressive storms there.  I have no idea if this predicted storm is going to be significant or not.

With respect to being able to go anywhere other than the visitor center, that will depend on the weather and how far you want to walk.  The rim trail is paved in both directions from the south rim village.  The rim trail is 10 miles long in total.  You won't go that far, but there's a lot of distance to explore.  If you head east from the El Tovar hotel you can get to the visitor center, the geology center, and go all the way to the Kaibab trailhead.

The views are much more dramatic to the west toward Hermit's Rest.  But there is no shelter except for bus stops in that direction.   I'd not head that way if the weather was threatening.  Also, I would not advise going into the canyon if you're not used to walking at altitude (the altitude is 7300' at the rim), especially with kids.

Seeing as how you have a car, you can drive east out to Desert View.

There's an unmarked trail at Shoshone Pt.  It's a left hand turn into a small parking area just past mile marker 246 on rt 64 heading to Desert View (east) from the village.  There are definitely no guard rails there.  It's pretty dramatic.   But you do have to keep an eye on the weather.

Oh, BTW - The kids will probably like Bearizona but it is a bit pricey for what it is.   It's trying to be one of those Disney-style animal kingdom things where you see lions and giraffes right outside the car window.  But the animals are generally penned (the buffalo are running free).   Last time I was there it was warm out and all the bears were in the ponds and not obvious to see.  Mostly you see mountain goats and other less exotic animals (they do have a black jaguar).  But the kids just like animals so it's sort of a small zoo.",t2_q9zzm4l,jdmastroianni,0,1646249428.0,0,t1_hz36g0r,hz36g0r,False,AceMcVeer,t3_t4ng1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/t4ng1p/is_it_worth_visiting_this_weekend/,Is it worth visiting this weekend?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/t4ng1p/is_it_worth_visiting_this_weekend/hz36g0r/,1,r/grandcanyon,0,1

"Thanks. I wasn't sure how good the roads are maintained. We are coming from Vegas so our plan was to head get to Williams between 12 and 2 which is when the rain is supposed to start, do Bearizona for a couple hours then head to our hotel in Tusayan. The weather there seems to be around 40 for highs on Saturday with some periods of rain and snow and then snow Saturday night at 4 inches. We'd then leave Sunday morning and I'm not familiar with how quickly the roads improve there.   


So my biggest concerns were if we'd even be able to go anywhere other than the visitor center and Bright Angels or if we'd even be stuck in the hotel all of Saturday and then if we'd get delayed Sunday.  Plus with wind gusts of 40mph I wasn't sure how safe a lot of the GC places were with young kids. My 3 year old is ridiculously fast and didn't want him walking down a path and get blown away somewhere.  Also worried that they'd be at a lookout and they only be there for like 20 minutes and then I struggle to keep them entertained the rest of the day. 

Right now it's looking like we're going to switch and go to Death Valley instead along with Red Rock Canyon and maybe Mt. Charleston.",t2_nacus,AceMcVeer,0,1646246131.0,0,t1_hz2xti6,hz2xti6,False,AceMcVeer,t3_t4ng1p,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/t4ng1p/is_it_worth_visiting_this_weekend/,Is it worth visiting this weekend?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/t4ng1p/is_it_worth_visiting_this_weekend/hz2xti6/,2,r/grandcanyon,0,2
"Both are beautiful places, and if you want to see Death Valley you don't want to be there when it gets hot.   If you're just driving around and not hiking you may not see much in Death Valley, but it is also not to be missed.

The GC is magnificent and there is absolutely nothing that compares.  I live within 1 hour of the GC, and I go several times per month.   There are lots of good scenic walks on the rim and a good number of hotels and restaurants and shops at the south rim itself as well as in Tusayan just outside the main gate.  I would never advise anyone against going to see the canyon, especially if you haven't seen it before.   I have traveled all over this planet, and I can say there are only 2 things in the world that are much more impressive in person than you have ever seen in pics and must be experienced live. One is the canyon.  I never get tired of it.

However, we are expecting weather this coming weekend.  We do get a significant amount of snow here in northern AZ.  We got about a foot of snow last week here and typically I wind up shoveling about 10' of snow, total, per season.  Though, weather reports up here in the high country are notoriously inaccurate.   If snow is predicted for a Monday, it's more likely to show up on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Sometimes it snows when none is predicted, and visa versa.

This weekend looks to be an actual storm and I'd say that driving may be dicey.   It is reported to be starting Friday eve, and in full force by Saturday, but I'd move all that out a day.  It will probably start on Saturday and be in full strength by Saturday eve.

If my own children were coming to visit this weekend, I would suggest they get here early on Friday and leave first thing Saturday morning.   I40 gets shut down sometimes for snow (it was shut down for a few hours last weekend due to truck jack knifes).  I17 and the smaller roads, like I64 to the canyon, could be impacted.

I don't think you'd be risking your safety going to the GC, but you could wind up with more of an adventure than you anticipated.

Also remember that every direction is downhill from here, and so when we get snow up here at 7500' it's only rain once you get down to 5000', usually.

Hope you get to see the Canyon.

"I've worked at soun rim twice, both times for Xanterra, housing isnt the best for entry level possitions, especially for dudes, the main dorm is Victor or ""victim"" hall & sits right next to the muel barn, on warm days the smell was very strong. The bathrooms are also down the hall. the main girls dorm Colter hall is much nicer. Managment housing is pretty good to awesome, the mojave appartments are particularly nice as far as employee housing goes. Xanterra has an employee dinning area where you can get cheap food or you can buy ingredients & cook in your room (electric skillets, microwaves and george foreman grills. no hotplates). In my experience, the employees at grand canyon hang out & socialise as a group less then any othe park ive worked at, but its not too difficult to make friends. Theres lots to do & see at grand canyon, but it can be hard only having two days off in a row, thats not really enough time to do most the hiking trips if you want to recover before work.

"If you like hiking the canyon, it could be a good gig for you. I spend a lot of time up there and have many friends who have worked for the NPS up there and for the companies like DW that provide services in the canyon. Those who just work, then go home and stay home in their time off (the dorms or the trailer park) lose their minds quickly and don’t have a long career up there. On the other hand, if you love exploring the canyon and you want to dedicate all (or most) of your time to being below the rim (in good weather and in bad), you might find it to be the best opportunity for you. Really depends on what you’re looking for.

"I have lived at the South Rim for 2.5 years. Only come here if you really want to be at the Grand Canyon  - because it will be a trade off.  We love it, but it also isn't for everyone. It will depend on your housing situation and job. I think it's a nice community, but you do have to make some effort if you want to make friends. The rec center is pretty active. The drawback is that it is somewhat of a transient population (at least a certain percentage), so people are in and out. But overall I have found people friendly. The remoteness for some is a feature and can also be a hassle (most residents drive to Williams or Flagstaff to get groceries and you have to plan ahead for things). 

In the end, nothing is permanent - I say go for it. If you end up not liking it, you move on and find something else.

"Right now the park is pretty empty, but will likely be busy next weekend for President's Day and will start getting busier in March. If you have the ability to visit on a weekday I would do that. 

I would look for a reservation in the park. There are several lodges/cabins on the rim and two that are off the rim. I think the only rooms with a view are the suites at El Tovar and that means going out in a balcony, which is chilly this time of year. But the lodges on the rim are in a great location to walk out the door and be at the rim.  I would book a meal at El Tovar - I actually like lunch (currently requires a reservation) or breakfast (no res needed). I think dinner is good too, just $$$$ for the meal. 

If you visit before March 1, you can drive yourself on Hermit's Road (shuttle starts again on March 1 and no private vehicles). I think it is nice to see the viewpoints in Hermit's and on Desert View as they are different (canyon more eroded and open to the east).  

You can enter the park through one entrance and exit through the other - that way you can drive Desert View, stop at the tower, and see the viewpoints (Lipan is one of my favorites). 

There are 13 miles of rim trail and you can go for a walk if you want. The section between the village and Yavapai is the Trail of Time if you want to learn about the geology. You can do this one way and use the shuttles to return to the visitor center or village.",t2_ppaq2dy,PudgyGroundhog,0,1644622667.0,0,t1_hwkp5ef,hwkp5ef,True,MathPancakes,t3_sqc0bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/sqc0bc/visit_from_phoenix/,Visit from Phoenix,/r/grandcanyon/comments/sqc0bc/visit_from_phoenix/hwkp5ef/,9,r/grandcanyon,0,9

"For now I’m only going to comment on the trekking poles, get a pair! I did rim to river and back a few years ago without and R2R last summer in June with poles and it was so much better having them.

Eh, changed my mind: 

Are you staying one night or multiple nights? Also depends on your group size, on our R2R we were in the group site which had a large rock structure that was nice to set up camp inside. This was at Phantom Ranch CG.

Having a bottle with a filter I would say is pretty necessary, though you may not NEED it.

Stove depends on what you want to eat, and again how many days. On our first trip I survived on granola, Gatorade and water.

Tent, go light and probably leave your fly on the rim.

I wasn’t the master planner of the R2R but we drove to the North Rim, stayed in a cabin and then stayed in a nice room on the South Rim and shuttled back in a group bus the following morning to get our car from the North Rim.

"Here's what I did when I did this same trip: 

Day 1 - get to South Rim, catch 1 pm shuttle to North Rim. Camp at North Rim campground in the hiker/biker area. (One of the best campsites you'll ever find, BTW.) 

Day 2 - start hiking EARLY. It's a mile and a half from the campground to the trailhead. Don't be a doofus and sleep late and end up getting to the trailhead at 5:30 am - you want to be there at 3:30 at the latest. I paid for that mistake with some mild heat exhaustion. Camp at Bright Angel. 

Day 3 - start hiking out EARLIER. I got camp packed up and left at 3:15 AM, and I'd have liked to gotten out earlier like other campers. I got to Indian Garden about sunrise, and the temps were OK the rest of the way up.  

Camping - I kept an eye on the forecast, and it was warm enough that it was only supposed to get down to the mid 50s on the North Rim. 30s in June are not uncommon. I had my Six Moon Designs Lunar Solo tent, an uninsulated pad, a small inflatable pillow and a Costco down throw and I was fine. If it's gonna be in the 30s you'd need an insulated pad and a better bag/quilt. At the bottom? I just put my pad on top of the picnic table at my site. No blanket... it was too damned hot for that. It's also too damn hot for a tent if it doesn't rain. Next time I do a summer R2R I'll just take a tarp for the North Rim camping and as a ""just in case"" for rain at the bottom, plus it can be a shade as well. 

Other stuff - I would recommend some camp sandals. You're going to spend a lot of time hanging out in Bright Angel Creek to stay cool, and trust me, you don't wanna stub your toe on one of the creekbed rocks. Take a credit card and cash (credit card preferred, cash in case the machine goes down, which happens at times) so that you can get cold drinks and snacks at Phantom Ranch. There are summer Hike Smart tips on the GC site - learn 'em, live 'em, love 'em. They can save your life. Do not be on the trail between 10 and 4 during the day. I live in southern Arizona, and our temps are similar to the canyon bottom, but the heat is different down there, it's a lot harsher, because the rock walls soak up the heat and radiate it back out. I went no-cook since it was July and it was stupid hot, the last thing I wanted was any hot food. Get a wide brim hat, no baseball caps, you need the sun protection. I'd also suggest a cooling towel and make sure you wet it at each chance you get. I wear mine either around my neck or under my hat. Trekking poles - YES. You will be astounded at just how harsh canyon downhills are on your feet and knees. 

Fitness - are you up to a ten mile hike with 4200' of gain in one day? Because that's what you're going to get on day 2. The last 3000' feet are over the last 4.5 miles. On day 1, you're going to pound 4200' downhill in 7 miles. Yes, it can very well hurt. Then the last 7 miles, it's 1600' and it feels like no slope at all... except you're at lower elevation and it will get hot in a hurry. Do not hesitate to seek shade and/or soak in the creek if you think you are at all overheating. Once you get too hot, it will take a hell of a long time to cool off, so you want to nip that in the bed.",t2_btttf,sunburn_on_the_brain,0,1644367370.0,0,t1_hw5r7dk,hw5r7dk,True,Isom15,t3_sno722,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/sno722/planning_for_r2r_first_week_of_june/,Planning For R2R First Week of June,/r/grandcanyon/comments/sno722/planning_for_r2r_first_week_of_june/hw5r7dk/,1,r/grandcanyon,0,1

You'll check in with the campground host and they can show you to the right area. It's almost right on the rim, so it ended up being a really neat place to camp.

I think the only restriction was that you could not have a car, so you should be able to take the shuttle the day before you hike.

"Sleeping - I'd recommend cowboy camping. The night sky is incredible and as long as they're not forecasting rain for your evening in the canyon, it's not worth the tent imo. A 30 degree bag/quilt should be plenty for one night in the canyon in June. Pair that with a hoodie, and you should be fine whether camping at the rim or in the canyon. 

Some sort of water purification (whether filter, tablets, Aquamira drops, etc) is a necessity. As others have mentioned, the pipes in the canyon are aging and can break at any time. Typically, Manzanita Rest House, Bright Angel, and Indian Garden have water year round. It's likely 3-Mile and 1.5 Mile Rest Houses will be turned on by June. I would aim to carry 2 liters of water/electrolytes and refill whenever you get the chance.

Stove - it's up to you. If you get a meal reservation, I'd skip the stove. If not, you can definitely survive without it. I did a 3 day no cook Rim to Rim to Rim and was fine. 

The canyon is one place I would be very hesitant to hike into without poles. The 6k feet of drop from the north rim to Bright Angel, and 5k feet of climbing up to the south rim are no joke.

"Edit: this was supposed to be a reply to hikeraz. Whoops. 

This is all great advice. I did a September backpacking trip with my fam and it was still hot as hell in the canyon. We started hiking between 3:30-4am every day. We finished by sunrise each day since we were doing max 7.5mi between campsites. Then spent the whole day chilling in the shade and at the river (BA campground) or in the creek (IG campground). The key components are hiking when it’s dark and making sure you have the right food & water. If you start to feel like shit and you’ve had plenty to drink, you probably need to eat a salty snack and chill for an hour. Many people are hyper vigilant about drinking enough water in the canyon and then get themselves into trouble when they don’t eat enough. The hardest day will be your hike out via NK. Start early, take it slow, and if you are still hiking when the sun comes up, spend the rest of the hot daylight hours at the Roaring Springs/Manzanita rest area before you hike out. If you have questions about backpacking gear, feel free to reach out, as I’ve got a couple Grand Canyon-specific gear lists I’ve put together when I’ve taken people on trips. But don’t take this stuff lightly - people do die every year from heat illness in the canyon. Starting your hike at 4am isn’t an optional thing… it’s a necessity for your health and safety.",t2_35qtxxny,gc_at_hiker,0,1644276530.0,0,t1_hw0ec11,hw0ec11,True,Electronic-Advice552,t3_smsn8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/smsn8a/can_my_group_handle_it/,Can My Group Handle It?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/smsn8a/can_my_group_handle_it/hw0ec11/,1,r/grandcanyon,1,1

"What trail are you hiking down? If it’s South Kaibab, I strongly suggest you get on the 4am hikers shuttle that takes you directly to the trail head. You will be on the trail by 4:30. If you are in good shape, it will take you approximately 3.5-4.5 hours to hike down depending on how long your breaks are. So in theory you would beat the extreme heat of the day. As long as you beat the heat & stay hydrated, you will be fine, but S. Kaibab is completely exposed and has no water available on trail. Not a trail you want to hike in the daytime heat. Bright Angel trail is longer, but less exposed. With water Available (assuming the pipeline is working). As others have said, spend your day hanging out in the creek. Having a small packable camp chair with you makes the hang pretty enjoyable. But DO NOT underestimate the heat & or the downhill hiking.",t2_1she7mf5,BackcountryAZ,0,1644256907.0,0,t1_hvz0hon,hvz0hon,True,Electronic-Advice552,t3_smsn8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/smsn8a/can_my_group_handle_it/,Can My Group Handle It?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/smsn8a/can_my_group_handle_it/hvz0hon/,2,r/grandcanyon,0,2
"hikeraz has the best summary. To add: Start your hike into the canyon EARLY. Like 3-4 AM early. Good headlamps will illuminate the trail very well. You want to be done by 10 AM at the latest. It’s seven miles down South Kaibab, but the downhill is pretty brutal (oh your feet are just gonna love those last two miles /s ) so don’t think you’ll make great time on a downhill. Bonus - you should be somewhere around Skeleton Point for the sunrise, and you’re gonna really enjoy that.  

Don’t skimp on the water. I start South Kaibab with a minimum of three liters of water in cooler weather, 4 liters if it’s warmer. That may seem like overkill, but there’s no water on SK, you may need to use a little for cooling, and you may run into someone in trouble. 

Sun protection - long sleeve lightweight shirts (I love Columbia Tamiami shirts for this) and a wide brim hat. Use sunscreen and chapstick. 

At the bottom - you’re going to spend most of the day hanging out in the creek to stay cool. You can get cold drinks (beer, lemonade, I think tea) at Phantom Ranch, a place you will come to love. You can go up and explore Phantom Creek in the morning, but don’t be out too late because that’s in The Box, a place you do not want to be midday. It becomes an oven. 

On the hike out - start earlier. 3 AM at latest. The first seven miles is mostly unshaded and at low elevation and it will heat up fast in the sun. Then you start the climb up and you want to get some of your elevation before it gets too hot. If you can get above 5000-6000 feet before the sun starts blazing around 9-10 AM, you should be good. Don’t be afraid to take plenty of breaks, and if it’s getting too hot, find shade and hide out until late afternoon. 

The Hike Smart tips on the GC webpage are important. Learn ‘em, live ‘em, love ‘em. 

Good luck. Yes, people do get in heat trouble in GC in summer, but the ones who do usually have disregarded some of the important rules about summer hiking.

"Many of the other comments have excellent advice.

I worry, though, about ""moderately active \[not sure how to calibrate that\] first-time backpackers"" taking on a first-time Grand Canyon hike in the hottest time of the year.  It's easy to underestimate the heat standing at the top, and by the time you realize you have a problem you're typically deep down in the Canyon and have a long hike back to the top.  Heck, in GC even the lizards estivate in June. :)

I recommend reading [this post](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dying-at-the-grand-canyon/) about deaths in GC by month, and also the book [Over The Edge: Death in Grand Canyon](https://www.amazon.com/Over-Edge-Death-Grand-Canyon/dp/097009731X).

"Yes, this is definitely doable, and I think you've assessed your likely weaknesses well.  Plan ahead to prepare yourself for success.

1) Altitude - start building more cardio into your workouts.  Stay in Flagstaff for a day or two ahead of your trip if you can.  Do some light hiking, nothing too serious that will leave you sore.  Eat, and sleep well, rest, don't drink too much beer.

2) Elevation Change - If you don't have mountains or even steep hills near you start climbing stairs.  Parking garages can be great for this.  Put on a heavy pack, climb the stairs up and down as many times as you can.

3) Temperature management - Start hiking in a wet T-shirt.  Carry a second wet shirt in a Ziploc bag, change out shirts whenever they get dry and re-wet them when you fill up water.  Start early and plan to be in a shady resting spot during the hotest part of the day if possible.  If not this is where the wet shirt comes in to play.  Don't rest in the sun.

4). Hydration - Start hydrating the day before your hike.  Use a hydration bladder with ice in it.  Carry a separate bottle of electrolytes sports drink and eat salty foods.",t2_cpvzq,njp9,0,1644249044.0,0,t1_hvygi5t,hvygi5t,True,Electronic-Advice552,t3_smsn8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/smsn8a/can_my_group_handle_it/,Can My Group Handle It?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/smsn8a/can_my_group_handle_it/hvygi5t/,1,r/grandcanyon,0,1
"Without knowing a lot about you, I’d guess you’ll be ok. Read on for advice…

I’m less concerned about the distance/climb than the “first time backpacking” thing. 

Here is my suggestion:

You said you have some time. 

1) start day- hiking with full packs. This will get you used to the way they feel and you can learn what different ways of packing your bag feel like.

2) incorporate some really steep climbs/descents into those day hikes. Get used to what it feels
Like on your knees-you may discover it’s no biggie, you may find you want a simple sleeve-style knee brace. 

3)If you don’t already, get and learn how to use trekking poles correctly. I became a convert when preparing for my R2R a few years ago and freaking love them when there’s a lot of steep down hill.

4) try to do at least 2 nights backpacking locally and make sure you know how to use your gear. In my 20+ years of purely amateur/intermediate level going hiking and backpacking with inexperienced people, not knowing how to work the stove/patch a sleeping pad/manage a blister are far more trip-trashing than the fitness level needed to take a long walk.

It’s from over 10 days ago, and they refresh it once or twice a month, but May was already almost wiped out completely. You can keep an eye on it and see if something opens up. If you’re thinking of applying for June, the time to do that is NOW. They are taking requests (by fax or snail mail, but no guarantees that mail wil get there by the first) and then they take all June requests they have at 5 pm on February 1st and put them in random order. Keep in mind that capacity at Bright Angel Campground is reduced right now. If you’re able to list a range of dates and be flexible on what campgrounds you can take, your chances of getting a permit will go way up. 
  
Also, if you’re thinking of doing June, make sure you know what you’re getting into. Summer heat in the canyon is no joke. A lot of people end up getting evacuated in the summer, some of them end up getting IV fluids on the spot because they’re in that much trouble, and some of them die.

"Friday fly SWA to Vegas under $800 for 2, rent Mazda SUV from Avis $150, room on Boulder Hiway - closer to GCNP - $100-120. Rooms available right now at the South Rim for under $200, I like the Bright Angel Lodge, right at the rim and at the BA trailhead.

Looks like it may snow a bit but shouldn't be too bad, 4 wheel drive just in case. If you do stay at Bright Angel take a walk just before bed, when everyone else is gone, take a light and walk 10-15 minutes down the BA trail and turn off the light, look and listen.

"I agree with the other posters - book in the park if you can. Visitation is low right now, so it shouldn't be hard to find lodging (either in the park or in Tusayan). 

The rim trail is currently clear, but if you plan to hike into the canyon, you will want traction devices (ice on top portions of the trails). Bring your winter gear - it has been okay during the days - mostly sunny and high 40s/low 59s - but it gets cold when the sun goes down. Bring a flashlight/headlamp. 

Some of the restaurants are still closed and others still have a limited menu. If you are avoiding shuttles, I am assuming you are avoiding indoor dining, so plan accordingly. I would bring a cooler with you and stop before the canyon to stock up on snacks and picnic lunches.

Stargazing is awesome at the park.  Pay attention to moonrise times.  we’re coming out of a full moon and the bright moon will make seeing stars less impactful. 

Camping? Backpacking? Hotels? 

There are lots of walk up options for camping in the park(Mather campground) and outside of the park (BLM land in the national forest just south of Tusayan)
 
One awesome option is to try for a walk up reservation for Phantom Ranch.  That would require hiking 8 miles down and 10 miles out of the canyon and about $300.  You have to ask in person at the Bright Angel lodge at least 24 hours in advance.

If you’re interested in backpacking you can go to the backcountry office and ask about walk up permits.

If you’re going to hotel staying in the park is awesome.  Being able to walk to the rim and just be with the canyon is worth it to me. 

Bring bikes if you’ve got them/ are able & interested/ you can rent them in the park at Mather point.  Riding bikes along the 13 mile long rim trail is an excellent option.

Drive down to the watchtower and check out the many vistas along the way.

"The best place to stay for visiting Grand Canyon National Park (the South Rim) is any lodging in the park on the rim; second-best is Yavapai, which is inside the park but not on the rim; and then Tusayan, which is outside the park. You can go to grandcanyonlodges.com to search availability at the five rim hotels; it looks like there are several available for the weekend, but if they aren't in your budget then check elsewhere.

I haven't visited GC in winter so I'm not sure what's open and available right now, particularly avoiding the shuttles (you should definitely check the GCNP website before making the trip). I believe that at this time of year, you can drive your own car west to the Hermit's Rest viewpoints (instead of having to take a shuttle); you can always drive yourself to the viewpoints east of the village/visitor's center; and of course you can always walk along the rim. If you want to try hiking down into the canyon, the Bright Angel trail leaves from the village area; the South Kaibab trailhead (steeper, but views are better) ordinarily requires a shuttle but you may be able to get away with parking nearby in January.

The campground has it's own bathroom and the other bathrooms by the bunk houses are also available for use.  Through hikers, day hikers, bunkers, Ranchers, campers, everyone makes use of the amenities at Phantom Ranch.

What’s cool to you isn’t what’s cool to everyone else which is why people come on here asking advice and people give their opinions/experiences who have been in the area so they can choose what they want to do. People don’t really come to this sub to tell people their opinions/experiences are wrong.

"I did upper antelope canyon in December. If you like be rushed through every pic, herded like cattle and having the tour ‘guide’ take your phone from you, change all your settings and tell you how you should take pics, take a tour. 

It is pretty but not worth the time and effort for a quarter mile slot canyon. I heard lower antelope canyon is much less busy and has better sun during winter but I’m just repeating what I was told. 


There are some airbnbs around Grand Canyon junction and Tusayan I’ve stayed at a couple times and it’s close enough to still drive in to the park and catch the sunrise. Unless you can stay in the park, that’s the best. 

Oh and horseshoe bend is an absolute must if you’re going to page. I’ve been three times (morning, afternoon and sunset for pic variety)and would still go back. You can explore as much as you want. There is only one real picture spot where all the people gather but there are some great ledges to stand on and it’s just a beautiful place to explore if exploring is your thing.

You can do this at horseshoe bend. If interested I’ll tell you how to get there.

"Do yourself a favor and get a room in the park. I don't believe there's any Airbnb places out there. You'll probably spend a little more but you'll be right there and that gives you a lot more time to enjoy the canyon, plus catch sunrise and sunset.  

As for Page - if you go there from GC, you're going to spend close to six hours of a day driving for a short time of seeing things. Horseshoe Bend is a little over a half mile walk from the parking area, and it gets crowded. It doesn't take long to visit at all. Antelope Canyon might take an hour of the day. So you're driving a good chunk of the day for a couple of hours to see two crowded attractions.  Save the Page area for when you can come back during warmer months, when you can go do North Rim, Zion, Bryce Canyon, etc.

My recommendation for what to do in the park? Take in the east rim viewpoints - Deseert View Drive is 25 miles and there's several viewpoints along the way. Then the west rim viewpoints, especially later in the day when the sun is getting low. If you hike into the canyon, you'll need YakTrax or similar. But one thing I definitely recommend is to go to Bright Angel Lodge early in the morning - bundle up! - and get a coffee and a snack from Bright Angel Coffee Shop out back. Then enjoy coffee along the Rim Trail, watching the light change in the canyon as the sun comes up.

If you can, staying in the park is very cool. But if that’s too much $$, we’ve stayed in Tusayan lots of times and it’s a 15 minute drive max to get into the main rim.

"Last I knew Antelope Canyon was closed by the pandemic. That was true all the first part of this year. It is commonly visited in the summer as the angle of the light allows beams to reach the floor at midday.

Antelope and the Grand are about as different as redrock canyons can get; Antelope is a very small and intimate place you get a crowded guided tour of for 45 minutes.

The Grand Canyon spills beyond the bounds of its National Park and includes infinite opportunity for solitude and wilderness and many very different landscapes.

At the South Rim, I would 100% for sure splurge and stay in the park, at one of the on-rim lodges if possible. Or at the Yavapai Lodge, which is very convenient if not directly on the rim. You can stay in Tusyan also but it's a really great experience if you never have to drive, or, just move a mile or two, instead of going back and forth.

You can then spend your time walking the fabulous south rim Rim Trail...

"That's a really important issue you've brought up -- thank you.  Here's how I got that number.  I make my own dehydrated food, and the recipe I use for breakfasts and dinners is a ground beef stew fattened up with coconut cream, which has the following ingredients (the nutritional info for various ingredients are taken from [https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/](https://www.fatsecret.com/calories-nutrition/)):

&#x200B;

|**Ingredient**|**Amount**|**Total fat (g)**|**Total carbs (g)**|**Total protein (g)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|ground beef (73% lean)|2 lbs|240|0|136|
|olive oil|2 tbsp|27|0|0|
|onion (large)|1/2|0|5.5|0.5|
|bell pepper|1 (about 1/2 lb)|0.5|11|1.8|
|potatoes|1 lb|0.45|71.3|7.6|
|butternut squash|20 oz|0.6|82|10|
|kidney beans (1 can  = 1 lb)|1 can|0|64|23.6|
|chick peas (1 can = 1 lb)|1 can|7|70|20.9|
|coconut cream (1 can = 13.5 fl oz)|1 can|133.3|0|20|
|**Total**||**409**|**304**|**220**|

Assuming 4 calories per gram of carb and protein and 9 calories per gram of fat, this totals up to about 5775 calories.  When I dehydrate this, it dehydrates down to about 30 oz, so I end up with about 5775/30 = 192.5 calories per ounce (it's possible that some of the oil may have evaporated away during dehydration so the actual calorie count may be a little lower, but hopefully not a huge amount).

"I don't work for Xanterra, but have experience with them. Our family's opinion is that the food is abysmal. The employee dining room was okay pre-pandemic, but has really gone downhill (very limited options, sold out of items, not healthy).

"Thanks everyone for the advice. UPDATE: it was a pretty easy ride- though long. The first 2 hours it’s pretty easy. The last hour before Williams and the hour up to the GC had snow around the roads. At 11am the roads around Williams and heading toward the GC had some ice on them for 3 or so miles, but weren’t really a dangerous situation even for my small vehicle. I’d imagine if you want before sunrise the roads would of been very slick.

For posterity, it’s been 2 days since snow fall, the high of today was 35deg and low of -6 f. I left Vegas strip at 7am and arrived at the GC around noon. I then left the GC at 3:30 and arrived back at the strip around 7:30.

Overall a single day trip is worth it if you have never seen it and in a winter season where you’re vacationing and can’t get proper gear because you’re on vacation in Vegas.

AZ511.com with NPS Website was helpful to check for road closures and crashes. Naturally if you see a lot of crashes due to ice you know it’s iced.

"Since you are driving from the north, there is a possibility that Desert View Drive (aka East entrance) may be closed in heavy snow conditions. The GC village and south entrance usually takes priority when clearing. If Desert View Drive is closed, you would have to take 89 south all the way to Flagstaff and come in through the south entrance via I-17/hwy 64. This could add a couple hours to your trip. Otherwise, the east entrance can be hilly and curvy, so make sure to drive cautiously if there is still ice/snow on the road.

"I would plan on the 20 degree bags, since ratings are often generous unless you own expensive ones (and sometimes even then...) Also, for the ladies, they sleep colder than males. Women specific sleeping bags are rated differently and you should add ten degrees to a sleeping bags rating to get a tough idea what a women’s rating would be, so if your bag was a legit 20, it would be rated around 30 for women.  
  
Weather - It could be in the 50s overnight, it could be in the 20s, likely upper 30s to 40s but no guarantees. To give you an idea, I’ve done Indian Garden two separate times in late February. One trip, I was fine with an uninsulated Klymit and a Teton 20 degree bag (which is really more like a 40 degree bag in my experience.) Earlier this year, it was 25 and windy overnight and I layered my EE Apex 40 quilt with a Costco quilt, and used my Nemo Tensor insulated and stayed decently warm. Mid-March last year at IG, I used a Klymit Ultralite Insulated and a 20 degree UGQ quilt. It was 35 and raining overnight, but I stayed warm except when my arms went off the side of my pad. So while the 40s are a likely average, you don’t know exactly what you’ll get. One thing I would recommend is buying a SOL Emergency Blanket for everyone. If someone gets cold, that can help stay warmer. They’re $5 each. There are cheaper Mylar blankets, but these will hold up better.",t2_btttf,sunburn_on_the_brain,0,1639118710.0,0,t1_hnyiz25,hnyiz25,True,PorcupinePattyGrape,t3_rd1js7,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/rd1js7/what_degree_sleeping_back_for_indian_garden/,What degree sleeping back for Indian Garden Campground in late March?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/rd1js7/what_degree_sleeping_back_for_indian_garden/hnyiz25/,8,r/grandcanyon,0,8

BTW ""shorter"" may not necessarily mean ""easier"".  For example the South Rim rim-to-river hikes all have roughly the same total elevation change, so shorter can mean steeper (e.g., New Hance Trail, at 6.5 miles the shortest South Rim rim-to-river trail, is significantly steeper than Bright Angel, which is about 10 miles long).",t2_2hijwuv4,yarb3d,0,1638991249.0,0,t1_hnr6514,hnr6514,False,yarb3d,t3_rbsbfp,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/rbsbfp/some_pictures_from_last_weeks_grand_canyon/,"Some pictures from last week's Grand Canyon backpacking trip (Nankoweap Trail, GCNP North Rim)",/r/grandcanyon/comments/rbsbfp/some_pictures_from_last_weeks_grand_canyon/hnr6514/,1,r/grandcanyon,0,1

"Haha yes, liberating beer from rafters is definitely a plus.  One time we spent so much time on this must-do activity we had to finish our hike over to Kwagunt Creek in the dark.

On this trip, we had two guests from Canada who hadn't anticipated the difficulty of the hike (looking at a topo map doesn't quite prepare you for that Supai traverse, especially the sphincter-clenching exposed stretches) and needed some recuperation time at the bottom, so we ended up having to cut out the loop over to Kwagunt Canyon.  That was disappointing.

Re: side hikes -- looking down from the campsite above Tilted Mesa, it looks like it wouldn't be too difficult to scramble down, along the north side of Tilted Mesa, to the Little Nankoweap -- from where, in theory, one might follow the Little Nankoweap down to the Colorado.

"If it was me, I'd probably stay in Flagstaff because I likely would've done a difficult hike at GC and only would be down to drive an 1hr or so before crashing for the night. Next day, I would be able to drive the rest of the way to LA easy peasy.

Though you're taking your elderly father so likely not going to be doing difficult hikes and what not. So probably leave GC and driving to LV would be easy in a day. 

I don't think LV is cheaper than Flagstaff though. I can typically find rooms in Flagstaff for 50-70 US dollars and LV you can find rooms around the same price if you include resort fees.

"I've been there twice in Winter. It's doable, just monitor the weather. They clear the roads pretty quickly regardless. Hiking in the canyon is nice, since it's only icy/snowy on top. Hike down a few miles and most of it is melted off. Bring microspikes and poles for the first few miles. The main trails (South Kaibab and Bright Angel) down are pretty wide and well maintained so it isn't really dangerous even if there is ice on the trail

Petrified Forest is another NP you can hit. Also, Walnut Canyon, Sunset Crater, and Wupatki National Monument are other choices in that area.

I would stay at GC if it's your first time there. It's more convenient to be in the park if you are staying multiple days. Also, it's great to wake up and see the canyon a few steps from your room.

"I have to second the classic hike. We did this this year for our first back country foray. S.K. follows a ridge line so every time you turn the corner, the views are spectacularly different. B.A. is walking into a canyon, so it's a much different experience. 

If you can, I would camp at IG rather than hike out in one day. It gives you more time to just enjoy it. S.K. has no water on the trail, although if you are going in March it's maybe not as important a consideration as it was for us in June.

As far as sleeping close the trailhead, they have shuttles that will get you there, so if you're staying anywhere in the park it's really not too much of a concern. If you can't find a place to stay in the park, you'll still park at the BCO (which is long term parking for hikers) and the shuttle picks up right there.",t2_2jmra1x7,happygiraffe91,0,1637247318.0,0,t1_hl4k8we,hl4k8we,False,Bubbles8810,t3_qweuru,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/qweuru/closest_south_rim_lodging_to_trailhead/,Closest south rim lodging to trailhead?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/qweuru/closest_south_rim_lodging_to_trailhead/hl4k8we/,2,r/grandcanyon,0,2

"Thanks for all the great info! Yeah, I realized I was late to the planning game so counted out Phantom Ranch as an option. We like camping and saves some money, so not mad. I plan to reserve meals there though so we have less food to pack. I’d like to spend 2 nights camping at bottom, so sounds like South Kaibab>Bright Angel Campground>Indian Garden Campground>Bright Angel out is our best option, from others feedback. 

I’ve only been to Grand Canyon once, when I was a little older then my son. Following my uncles wedding we all hiked to Havasupai lodge and spent two nights hiking, seeing falls etc. It was such an amazing experience and so incredibly beautiful. I’m so excited to share this with my son now. Looks like Havasupai still won’t be an option next year, so excited to check out other areas of the canyon.

"First of all, ditch the travel book and get to know the NPS website, it will have the most current info. There are so many definitions of rim to rim it is hard to know what you are trying to accomplish. The North Rim does not open until May 15 so that R2R would be hard. If you mean SR-river-SR that is definitely doable if you are in good enough shape. The BC permits are for camping, one is not needed for a day hike. If you want to spend the night, there will probably not be any unclaimed for Spring break. Check frequently for cabins at Phantom Ranch and rooms on the rim. I like Bright Angel Lodge, it is right on the rim, at BA TH and is a shuttle stop as well as being the most affordable. 

Best trail for hiking in is South Kaibab, better views of the canyon but no water or shade. BA has water, at least at Indian Garden, shade and sheltered rest stops. You have to be in very good shape to go all the way to the river and back in 2 days, awesome shape for a one day loop. You can do a truncated loop by taking the Tonto Trail from SK to IG. 

The best time to start planning a Grand Canyon hiking trip, especially your first one, is at least 15-18 months ahead of time. Phantom Ranch has a lottery 15 months out, hotels on the rim are 13 month reservation window. If you have a late cancellation window they often have no-shows available at 705am on day of arrival. I have reservations for spring that I have had for almost a year and am still trying to nail down the details, 2 people might cancel on me because of family health problems. It is really hard to line up new people on contingency. 

Best of luck and have a great trip.",t2_hr1ui,imnotsoho,0,1637214345.0,0,t1_hl36ugz,hl36ugz,True,Bubbles8810,t3_qweuru,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/qweuru/closest_south_rim_lodging_to_trailhead/,Closest south rim lodging to trailhead?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/qweuru/closest_south_rim_lodging_to_trailhead/hl36ugz/,2,r/grandcanyon,0,2

Road conditions can vary from perfectly bare roads down to being closed. But much more likely you’ll experience the former. 

As for “safe” time to be at the park—yes. If it’s unsafe because of a massive snow storm (only happened once or twice in the 20 years I’ve been here that I’m aware of) then the park will close.

"First, to be clear, what hike are you planning? When people say a rim to rim, they generally mean hiking from the South Rim to the North Rim or vice versa. The earliest you can do this is May 15th. Otherwise you need to do a rim to rim to rim or hike/ski the extra 40 miles in on the road from Jacob Lake. 

There are multiple shuttles at the Grand Canyon in the park. The blue shuttle (around the village-Vistor Center) and the orange shuttle (visitor Center to South Kaibab) run year round, as well as the hikers express (have to check time depending on the month). The shuttle on Hermit Road runs March 1- November 30. You can find more shuttle info on the nps.gov website for the Grand Canyon. 

Bright Angel, Thunderbird, El Tovar, and Kachina are on the rim and convenient to the Bright Angel Trailhead and easy to catch shuttles to the South Kaibab. Maswick is a short walk from the rim. Yavapai is still in the park, but not as convenient for you without a car. It is still accessible with the shuttles, but not as convenient to the trailheads.",t2_ppaq2dy,PudgyGroundhog,0,1637204433.0,0,t1_hl2nyg5,hl2nyg5,True,Bubbles8810,t3_qweuru,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/qweuru/closest_south_rim_lodging_to_trailhead/,Closest south rim lodging to trailhead?,/r/grandcanyon/comments/qweuru/closest_south_rim_lodging_to_trailhead/hl2nyg5/,2,r/grandcanyon,0,2
"Pretty much anywhere inside the park is gonna be close. Bright Angel Lodge, Thunderbird, and El Tovar are very close to Bright Angel trailhead. However, get the shuttle and do South Kaibab down. Bright Angel is a nice hike and all, but the views on SK are absolutely fantastic. Those are the kind of views you think you’re going to get on a GC hike. Bright Angel stays in the same drainage the entire way to Indian Garden so the view doesn’t really change.  

Be prepared to send in your permit request via fax on November 20 or shortly thereafter; they start processing April requests on December 2nd, and your app needs to be in by 5pm Arizona time to be in the stack for first consideration. (When you send it between 11/20 and 12/1 doesn’t matter - all permit requests received in that window are put into random order.) Also, keep stalking the corridor list. You can call the BCO and check for cancellations as well. 

My advice - don’t get too hung up on rim to rim. You’d have to do rim to rim to rim anyways that time of year, because the north rim will be closed. The “classic” hike is South Kaibab to Bright Angel Campground, then the next day up Bright Angel to Indian Garden, then Bright Angel out the third day. Know what alternates (dates, campgrounds, etc) you’d accept as there’s room to add them on the permit.

"I have done it in one day during June plus the out-and-back to Phantom Ranch and Plateau point. It's a long day, but totally doable for anyone with reasonable fitness. You may not have running water available in the canyon (check with NPS), so bring a water purification device (it's also good practice to bring one any time you're planning a hike longer than \~10 miles). Also bring a headlamp since there will be less daylight.

Since you said you are not an experienced hiker, a good conservative benchmark is 2-3mph on the downhill and 1-2 mph on the uphill. Get an early start and keep an eye on your pace. Remember, what goes down must come back up. :-)

When they say it takes 2x as long coming up as going down, they aren’t kidding. Bring water (camelbacks are great), food (gorp, protein bars, etc), and make sure your shoes aren’t going to give you blisters. BRING A FLASHLIGHT! Don’t spend a lot of time at phantom ranch, but get a t-shirt.

"Yes we have and it is doable in a day. Recommend down South Kaibab and up Bright Angel because Kaibab has no water. You can stop at Bright Angel campground (cross the bridge when you get to the river) to refill on water if you want. You should also have water at Indian Gardens and the rest houses closer to the top of South Rim as you go up.  

Would definitely take the first shuttle from the main lodge area to South Kaibab trailhead so you can get plenty of time for going up Bright Angel. Definitely have at least one trekking pole and expect a slow trek going up, especially from Indian Garden when the inclines get tougher.  On the conservative side 11-12 hours for the hike is a safe estimate, especially if you want to take longer stops or take pictures. With that in mind the first express shuttle to South Kaibab from the village is at 7am ([https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/hiker-express-shuttle.htm](https://www.nps.gov/grca/planyourvisit/hiker-express-shuttle.htm)) . If you get started by 7:30  it means you would be reaching the top closer to 7pm. I'm not sure if it will be completely dark yet but I would be prepared with headlamps just in case. 

I would have each person hike with a 3L bladder and fill up each chance you get. Also bring plenty of snacks, electrolytes and candy. Try to stay together as a group or in pairs at least. If you have walkie talkies then bring them so you can communicate if you need to split up. Have each person download a trail map to their phone for offline access or take close up pictures of the trail map at the trailhead.

Stopping for photos every 10 minutes will really cut into the day so be aware of time, I bring this up when people might be new to the canyon, it’s pretty amazing.  Consider the shuttle bus situation, I don’t believe you can park your car at south Kaibab, so you will need the shuttle bus.  With that said you have selected the right route for this hike.  Years ago when I frequented the canyon there was an early hikers shuttle, look into that.  Be careful and there is no shame in turning back.  Remember you will need to climb all the way out, your weakest hiker in the group needs to decide if they can make it down and out.  My first time doing this was with a group of guys too proud to admit weariness, we hiked out after dark and it was a bit scary and colder than we prepared for.

"Best rim depends on whether you value convenience or solitude. South is much more accessible, and as a result it is much more crowded.  North is 1000ft higher and because of this the snow closes it from the end of October until May. Honestly I think the views are better at the South, and there are more hikeable trails, but because it’s easier to visit the crowds are larger. 

Vegas is farther away but flights are usually cheaper, as are rental car costs. There’s not really a correct answer about airports IMO, just balance ticket cost vs rental car cost. I’ve always flown into Vegas just because my wife likes to gamble and I enjoy a good buffet after a hard hike. Not sure if that’s even an option post-covid. If you fly into Vegas you can visit the Hoover Dam along the way.

There are no bad hikes, but my advice for best views would be to go down the South Kaibab as far as you can. Certainly at least to Oh Aah Point. If you’re a real strong hiker go down the Bright Angel to Plateau Point and you can peer over the 1000ft+ drop off into the inner canyon.",t2_omwwze2,Elkins45,0,1636930113.0,0,t1_hkncjcy,hkncjcy,True,Coochie_monster7,t3_qtzdzo,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/qtzdzo/trip_recommendations/,Trip recommendations,/r/grandcanyon/comments/qtzdzo/trip_recommendations/hkncjcy/,3,r/grandcanyon,0,3

"Id recommend coming in from the south rim if you arent staying on the kaibab plateau. The drive from flagstaff to the north rim is pretty long, and the hike down to the bottom from the north rim is an extra 1000 feet elevation compared to starting from the south rim. If you’re lodging in flag, (I used to live there), then a north rim day hike, especially all the way to phantom ranch, is not really feasible imo. Not positive but I think generally the fastest way to phantom ranch is from the south rim as well, and even that I’m not sure how often is done as a day hike from top to bottom back to top in one day.

"- there aren’t really bears/cougars in this area, the scariest animal you’ll see is the bitey squirrels in the tourist areas. Actually the tourists themselves are the most dangerous animals. The mountains just north of Flagstaff might harbor a sleepy black bear but they’ll run away from you. Arizona doesn’t have grizzlies at all. 

- microspikes aren’t required but you’ll be starting this run early in the AM when it’ll still be frosty on the rim. I’ve literally slipped on frozen mule piss on Bright Angel and what a humiliating way to die THAT would’ve been.

"There’s a lot going on here, but I’ll start with what time of year are you doing this? Salt creek would put you at 12.5 miles to the Cremation drainage where you can camp, which is a whole lot of hiking- reckless in warm weather and very challenging in winter if you’ve got short days. The last few miles of Tonto leading to Cremation are rough and will slow you down. Once you figure out realistic mileages/goals for your time of year you’ll also have to consider how many nights you’re dry camping (carry extra water for that) and just the straight availability of sites (likelihood of your first choice is low if you’re going in spring).

"I visited the south rim of the Grand Canyon the week of thanksgiving a couple of years ago. 
I would fly into flagstaff if you want to be a little closer.  But Phoenix works too. 
Def rent a car! It’s in a slightly remote area. So going anywhere/doing anything requires a car. There are like buses/trollies that run through the park itself, but it’s easier to just drive. It’s miles and like 20-30 minute drives between all the like scenic spots to look at. Again, there’s trollies/buses but then your stuck to whatever the timing is of those and they’re much slower getting you from place to place. 
As far as hikes, I recommend downloading all trails app and picking hikes ahead of time and downloading their maps to use on the hikes. Bring crampons/microspikes with you for your hikes.

"Not sure what hikes you have done in the ADKS, but the corridor trails at the canyon are a walk in the park compared to the Northeast!  When we lived in NY and came to the canyon for vacations, we usually took it easy the first day (not too much exertion, hydrate, good sleep, Advil if needed for a headache), then were pretty much good to go after that. 

Bring traction devices just in case. The trails are clear now - but who knows what is coming down the pipeline and when. And definitely winter layers. Temperature swings are big, although it can be pleasant during the day if it's sunny with little wind and it will be warmer in the inner canyon.

The drive from Phoenix is 3.5 hours and from Vegas about 4.5 (plus a time change after DST ends - AZ doesn't follow DST).

"There are so many options when going out West. It's really difficut to figure plans out! When I visited the Grand Canyon, I flew into Phoenix around 8 am and rented a car the entire time. I then drove up through Sedona (stopped for a bit to hike in Sedona and grab lunch). I then drove up to Flagstaff, grabbed some groceries for my trip and spent the night there in an airbnb. From Flagstaff it was less than a 2 hour drive to the Grand Canyon. I hiked for a bit in the Grand Canyon on the same day I drove from Flagstaff, spent the night in the Grand Canyon Village, got up early and hiked all day in the Grand Canyon the next day, and then drove to Paige, AZ. I do not reccomend hiking all day, and then driving like I did my last day in the Grand Canyon. It was a very difficult drive to Paige, as I was so exhausted. However, I really enjoyed the drive and taking my time from Phoenix to Sedona to Flagstaff. There was so much to see just on the drive, and the hike in Sedona was not planned, but so worth it!

I went in early October a few years ago, and while it was not snowy in the Grand Canyon, it was snowy in Flagstaff, so just be prepared. I hiked a portion of the Bright Angel Trail.

I would do it all over again just because the hike was so beauftiful, but I was not prepared for how difficult it would be, and I would say that I pushed myself too hard on that hike. Honestly, I was a bit scared. I woud reccomend checking in with the park rangers at the visitor center before your hike.

All the hikes at GCNP are scenic. And depending on the weather, even the easiest trails can be challenging because of ice and snow.

"I don't think that is something we can answer for you - no idea what your experience is. Two things: 1) being in good shape for one activity doesn't translate 1:1 to another. 2) length of time of exercise and mental toughness.  How often do you do some kind of physical activity for 6+ hours? Sometimes that can be a challenge for people if they aren't used to it. And the extended downhill at the beginning can be hard for people who aren't used to it. 

With that said, as long as there isn't a big snowstorm, weather is good this time of year. Heat can be a bigger factor than fitness and heat won't be an issue (although fewer daylight hours).

"11 hours and 57 minutes. 
42 miles. 
Stayed on the South & North Kaibab trails the whole time. 

It’s been a tradition of mine to hike or trail run R2R2R for my birthday every year going back 7 or 8 years now. I live in Flagstaff, so I’m in close proximity and I absolutely love the canyon this time of year. October is the “middle bowl of portage.” It’s no longer too hot in the bottom and it’s not yet too cold up top. 

I normally start at midnight on my birthday (Oct 20), but had work obligations this year and put it off by 4 days until Sunday.  Started at sunrise. Finished right after sunset. This shot was from the setting sun at Cedar Ridge in the last 1.5 miles of the day. 

Overall the run went well. Not my fastest time, but I feel like anything under 12 hours is good for me. There are a lot of runners out there who can do it *way* faster, but I’m always happy with keeping it under 12. I first attempted this route probably 12 or 13 years ago and underestimated the miles and elevation gain, turned around at Manzanita, and only accomplished it for the first time later that year. I think my first time was around 16 or 18 hours. Back then I was just hiking it, but I know plenty of people who take that slow-and-steady approach and love it. It’s an especially nice way to do it if you catch it under the full moon. Id recommend starting early if you’re going to take your time with it though. Start around midnight or 1am so you’re hiking the dark while you’re fresh rather than at the end when you’re toasted. Finishing in daylight is always a nice lil’ bonus. 

Anyways, I hope this is somewhat helpful. 

Much love and happy trails.",t2_15jcjp,TheLostAlaskan,0,1635225180.0,0,t1_hi2w6ay,hi2w6ay,False,TheLostAlaskan,t3_qfql81,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/qfql81/ran_rim2rim2rim_yesterday_my_favorite_shot_from/,Ran Rim2Rim2Rim yesterday.

"One thing to keep in mind is that it will be COLD in late December. Lows at the Grand Canyon are already down in the 20s. If you plan on doing any hiking you’ll need lots of layers and probably crampons. Plus the water will be shut off so you’ll have to carry. 

In my opinion, 1 full day is enough for the Grand Canyon. I spent 3 days in Sedona and wish I had another day or two. Great hiking, beautiful views everywhere, good restaurants, art, etc. Recommend staying at The Matterhorn.",t2_1gy1xpdg,OneMoreDan,0,1635197738.0,0,t1_hi1cg08,hi1cg08,True,pwrofsun,t3_qfqcfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/qfqcfk/travelling_to_arizona_for_the_first_time/,Travelling to Arizona for the first time,/r/grandcanyon/comments/qfqcfk/travelling_to_arizona_for_the_first_time/hi1cg08/,2,r/grandcanyon,0,2
"Flagstaff is a good jumping-off point (easy highway access, etc.) between Sedona (45 mins)/Grand Canyon (90 mins)/Meteor Crater (45 mins) but Sedona will give you more local flavor. Either way 89A between them is a beautiful drive. 

Depending on how you want to play it the Grand Canyon Railway is a great time--you take an old steam train from Williams to the South Rim, stay for a few hours and then train back in time for dinner. During Christmas they do (or did, anyway) The Polar Express!

My go-to hidden gem is actually Jerome (it's like Sedona but at a 45-degree angle and haunted), but check your drive time.

Pink Jeep Tours in Sedona are touristy but fun.",t2_2k2sfm0t,Sgt_Smitty,0,1635197667.0,0,t1_hi1ca43,hi1ca43,True,pwrofsun,t3_qfqcfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/qfqcfk/travelling_to_arizona_for_the_first_time/,Travelling to Arizona for the first time,/r/grandcanyon/comments/qfqcfk/travelling_to_arizona_for_the_first_time/hi1ca43/,2,r/grandcanyon,0,2
"Get a map and check the distances, which are larger than you probably imagine. Look at historical weather records and assume the worst. Check hotel availability for GC and Sedona, which is likely less than you think.
