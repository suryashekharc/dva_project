"Why should we pay for veterans to get medical care? Why should I pay to subsidize farmers or oil companies or why should I pay for fire service if I never use it?

"Those low wages do not provide enough to acquire the skills or equipment necessary to start most businesses.

Universal healthcare would allow people to quit their job to pursue other ventures without fear of dying of an infected papercut.

Increasing taxes on the revenue streams of the oligarchs and forcing oligarchs to pay more money to their workers is a lot more effective for taking down the oligarchy. ""Compete"" is not the right word for a rigged game. There is no competition with oligarchs.

Why are there homeless in California? Could it be runaway housing prices caused by corporations buying up all the houses? Almond crops suffering due to declining bee populations and drought causing economic depression? Busses from other states bringing homeless in? Lack of mental health services? You're right the Democrats in California haven't done anything to fix it, but all of the problems stem from legislation that reeks of republican ideals.

"Well most recently the Dems capped insulin costs, while not perfect, will save $$$ for diabetic Americans from all walks of life. Dems mask came around to allowing my gay friends equal marriage rights, even though the 2020 GOP platform still wanted marriage enshrined as only between a man and woman. Hell, a GOP rep from Ohio just suggested that such laws should be up to individual states, including interracial marriage. Beyond that, Dems have pushed for Legal weed while GOP drags their feet. The 94 Crime Bill saw crime, especially violent crime, drop by almost 50% in the US. FDR’s New Deal dug us out of the depression, and his passing of social security helped dropped the poverty rate of elderly Americans from 40% to under 10%. Dude also signed the GI Bill.

"So honestly these comments made me laugh. I know I am at a very out number stance in this one but I really shouldn't be. I am not playing sides on this one but I do have to mention a couple things to attempt to make sure a couple of you at least kinda know the truth. 

The way this question is asked is funny to me. The comments sounds like people have been waiting for this question as well. But here is the real truth. It's not a republican thing or a democrat thing. It's a politician thing. If anyone still believes anything they say needs a reality check. A politician that truly cares about ""the people"" is a thing of the past. That is a profession that is ruled by money going all the way up to the president. Has anyone ever looked up the base salary of the president? I'll give you a hint, it's dog poop. If you think our minimum wage is low you would be surprised on politicians base pay. Where they make the real money is on the side. It's been that way for years. Things like big tobacco, big pharma, war on drugs, and oil company can pay the presidents yearly salary in one deal. It's not a republican or democrat problem. It's a government problem. You must remember the government is a business. A business must make money to survive. If they don't make money they can't stay in business. That should be enough to reply to over half the comments on here.

The minimum wage comments that I was reading is a fairly easy one as well. The jobs that pay minimum wage are not the jobs that are suppose to allow people to buy a house and a car. It's for people who need a side gig or kids first jobs to prepare themselves for the next thing in their life's. Don't expect to live comfortably on minimum wage. I do agree that it's extremely low and it's way past due to be raised but I'm not expecting to personally live off those wages either. If you need more money it's time to leave that job. You have out grown it. And that is just part of life. If you flipping burgers and pissed it is only minimum wage and you are convinced for some strange reason that you can't do anything better(which is most definitely not the truth) go get a job at a actual restaurant. You have to apply yourself because it's no one else's responsibility to do it for you. I promise it is part of life that everyone must do. No one retires as a line cook at McDonald's. It's a scary thought especially if you have never done it but that's the truth for every single state in the United States. Don't wait for someone to do it for you because it will never happen.

"When I went to register to vote as a Democrat, i got all sorts of the glares from the lady working at the office after she said ""oh, you're one of those...""

All over the place they had George W. Bush memes with caption ""do you miss me now?"" Even though was the eight year of Obama's presidency.

Keep in mind that these are the same people that drove around with ""if you won't stand behind or troops feel free to stand in front of them"". To say that they have a ""you're either with us or against us"" mentality is an understatement. Their mentality is ""you either agree with us or don't disserve to live"". They just don't have the spine to let it show unless they are in a mob charging a capitol.

And so divided we plunge.

Corporations are robbing the state and the people, hell people are literally being worked to death, the environment is collapsing, but the biggest news is an actor slapping another actor.

When people are broken and tired, when they have no more to take from the state, they will just relocate their headquarters to a better economic matrix.

"This is a terrible idea for so many reasons. The main one is even if Boise was socially an okay choice (maybe it is, maybe it's not, I really feel you could argue either way) it is not a good medical choice. Someone facing intense medical treatment should move somewhere with a top-rated clinic, as focused as possible on their particular issue. This particular path isn't a job to leave up to someone who sees a handful of patients a month -- this is a team effort that should include experienced psychiatrists, endocrinologists, and plastic surgeons who can work with you very closely and handle issues in a timely fashion.

You can, and most do, get out-of-state medical treatment for significant one-or-two-off issues, but when you are looking at years of intense treatment, it just doesn't make sense to live so far from your doctors. I know several people who are commuting out of state for medical care, and the first year is okay, but it will grind you down that all your breaks are dedicated to coordinating and attending out-of-state medical care. The travel will wear you down, too. By year two, everyone is just done with it. I know a person who straight up moved to be closer to their doctor and clinic. They were just exhausted and moving their whole darn house and life was legitimately easier.

I truly believe someone with complex medical needs, that will be lifelong, consider a location with a more experienced medical community than Idaho can consistently offer. (Caveat, Spokane is close enough for some of the Panhandle.)  The mental health care (which will be important as gender dysphoria is known to be comorbid with some intense and all too often severe mental illnesses) is also inadequate, in my opinion.

It sounds like you are a dependent of your parents and only have so much sway on the outcome of this -- I would suggest you sit down with them and map out what medical care is available to you in the Boise area, and if they find that adequate for your specific needs and plans. You should go so far as to call around and see if you can do a short telehealth appointment with several likely therapists and see what you think.  Make sure you can find someone with time to take you on. It's not good enough that a clinic exist, it has to have time and a place for you.",t2_wb7wk,Peliquin,0,1648943568.0,0,t1_i360yzo,i360yzo,True,Deadmanwalking2112,t3_tukmgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/tukmgl/hello_im_potentially_moving_to_boise_idaho_with/,"Hello, I’m potentially moving to Boise Idaho with my family but I need to know if it’s a safe place for LGBTQ+ people, I’m a Trans woman who hasn’t gone under any type of transitional therapy",/r/Idaho/comments/tukmgl/hello_im_potentially_moving_to_boise_idaho_with/i360yzo/,2,r/Idaho,0,2

"Trans woman who's lived just outside of Boise (Kuna, Meridian) for the majority of my life here. It's fine enough, as far as day-to-day life goes. Certainly far from the stereotype of red states as places where you get shouted down with slurs walking down the street or anything. Places closer to the downtown area of Boise have a pretty open LGBT culture. The politics are pretty shit for trans people though, they regularly try to shut down our rights and though they've not made too much headway its safe to say they're not done trying. Expect the news not to be super fun to watch. Trans healthcare also isn't too hard to come by given that it's a reasonably sized city. I was able to start HRT via informed consent without much searching around.

It's not any sort of LGBT sanctuary, if for some reason you were expecting that, but I wouldn't classify it as dangerous or anything either. I still think it's a perfectly nice community, personally. To an extent it's gonna depend on what you're used to at home. I've lived in Idaho my whole life so I'm pretty used to just ignoring all of the republican shit around me, bumper stickers and flags and all that.

""Warning"" people not to come is completely backwards to me.   I guess that's a well-meaning sentiment, sometimes, but it also sounds like people are trying to keep Idaho a certain way.

If you need to be in a San Francisco or Portland kind of ultra-liberal environment, obviously Idaho isn't that, but if you want to be a part of our progress going forward - and I would love for you to be that - come on over to Boise.   People who are uncomfortable with it will have to get the fuck over it.  (And as long as we don't ""warn"" people not to come, most will get over it, that's why it's so important to encourage and not discourage diversity).   And actual violence is very rare state-wide.  I'm not in your shoes as far as knowing what the other types of risks are and what your tolerance of them is, but, I'm not going to warn anyone not to come here.   I want you here.

"Boise is safer than the other parts of Idaho, but that’s to say there are parts of Idaho that are actively unsafe. Drive an hour north of Boise, and you’ll start seeing confederate flags openly displayed outside people’s doors, and their feelings about LGBTQ people are pretty much the same as their feelings towards POC.

There are a lot of people who are very vocal about their allyship as a countenance to all the bigotry in our state, especially in Boise, but it’s like a world of two extremes. Every June downtown gets covered in rainbow flags, and there are a lot of businesses that are incredibly vocal about their support for the LGBTQ community, but then you can regularly find vandalism/stickers promoting hate. We also have IFB churches like Shield of Faith that openly advocate for making homosexuality a death penalty offense (they go door to door, and can get pretty confrontational if you tell them to f-off).

Add to that the fact our government is actively, continuously, trying to pass laws to attack and dehumanize trans people and it’s a mixed bag at best. Google some of the anti-trans laws they’ve tried to pass if you haven’t already.

With all of that said, you’ll also be dealing with a different hardship if you move here: People in Idaho, and Boise especially, are actively being hurt by the rapid influx of people moving here. Our infrastructure and wages are not keeping up with the growth, and it’s pushing a lot of people into poverty, driving them out of their hometowns and away from their families, and hurting important aspects of our community such as our refugee program. A lot of people are very angry about this, and when people warn you to change your plates the moment you move here they aren’t exaggerating. I’ve actually had someone vandalize a rental car because it had out of state plates. This goes double if you’re coming from a “Blue” state, such as Washington or California. For example, a lot of the downvotes you’re getting are because you’re asking about moving here.

Edit: Is it the LGBTQ hate I’m not allowed to mention, or the rampant aggression towards people moving here from out-of-state? I’ve lived in Idaho my entire life, neither of these things are exactly secrets. Also, look at any “moving here” posts on either this sub or r/Boise—they always get riddled with downvotes for the simple fact they’re even asking about it.",t2_badj2,I_Heart_Squids,1,1648919360.0,0,t1_i34m05n,i34m05n,True,Deadmanwalking2112,t3_tukmgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/tukmgl/hello_im_potentially_moving_to_boise_idaho_with/,"Hello, I’m potentially moving to Boise Idaho with my family but I need to know if it’s a safe place for LGBTQ+ people, I’m a Trans woman who hasn’t gone under any type of transitional therapy",/r/Idaho/comments/tukmgl/hello_im_potentially_moving_to_boise_idaho_with/i34m05n/,3,r/Idaho,0,3

Right now I know of multiple families who are trying to find housing. Please, please, look into the cost of living. Also, keep in mind the population in the Boise area (this includes the whole Eagle, Garden City, Kuna, Caldwell, and Nampa) has grown exponentially. This has caused a housing crisis of sorts. There is really no rent control housing. I know the house we built back in 2007 for $150k would sell as is for $420k.

 Also, even with the growth, the medical community has grown with it.

When companies refuse & fail to “self-regulate,” which is generally *all the fucking time* despite what they promise, govt stepping in to make things right is exactly why we *have* government to begin with.

Well don't give me too much credit lol here in the northwest we do tend to use JoJo interchangeably. It was more so me being a potato Nazi in which case sorry if I devalidated your thoughts you were not really wrong. I separate them because they're prepared differently if you put what I describe as a JoJo next to a potato wedge the differences would be apparent and the flavor and texture  sets them in to different categories. Potato wedge is really crispy on the thin part and more full of soft squishy potato on the fat end covered by more of a rind rather than crisp. I often find them to be lack luster in the flavor and seasoning department with some exceptions here and there. For the JoJo it's like a giant battered french fry  the outside is crispy and is very well seasoned and since its much thicker than a French fry the inside ranges from a perfect squish to more of a starchy fry with a little more bite than squish. I have only ever seen them prepared like this at Minit market in Payette if you get a chance I highly recommend trying it out sometime.,t2_4dzdwdvh,Dick_Arnold,0,1648839495.0,0,t1_i30obrm,i30obrm,False,thatblackman,t3_ttdztz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Idaho/comments/ttdztz/what_is_the_best_cuisine_in_idaho_what_are_some/,What is the best cuisine in Idaho?

"1. More specifically, there's not an *exemption* for groceries in Idaho like there are in some states. That's not really a conservative/liberal thing.
2. Because this hasn't been an issue until roughly last week.
3. Because government schools were (again, until recently) generally regarded as pretty decent.  Private schools become popular when public school suck.  Measures by which Idaho schools suck tended to be based on raw funding, which wasn't a good measure until, again, roughly last week.  Contrary to what you hear on this sub, Idaho schools have historically been one of the first things to be funded.  This has all been a mess since 2020, but if you look back to the recession and stuff, School funding is a hot button that tends to get support at the state level.
4. That's just false.  Idaho is beyond only Utah and Colorado, as of 2020
5. Again, that's just false.  Consumption of most drugs in Idaho is well below the national average, and that includes alcohol use.
6. Idaho tends to ""Tax everything a little bit"". Part of the issue here is that Idaho has no major economic component that it can freely tax (like oil in Texas or Alaska) and really make it's money there. Our overall tax burden is right in the middle of the pack. Idaho is *not* a resource rich state.  We don't have much mining, we don't really have any oil and gas, we do have timber, but that's not what it once was. 
7. We only have one large city.  We have a low overall population and that doesn't make for an economic powerhouse, regardless of how business friendly you make yourself. A lot of our land is the property of the feds, and hence not really available for a lot of productive economic use.  Believe it or not, it's memory from Micron that's Idaho's biggest export (by $)

"There are a couple of Basque joints in downtown Boise; Leku Ona and Bar Gernika.   If you go to Leku Ona, I strongly recommend going with at least one other person and getting their Paella, they state it is a two person dish.   If you go to Bar Gernika, there are several dishes that go along well with their beer; Solomo sandwiches, their stew, and their croquettas.    I have problems with self control and usually end up ordering 3 or 4 orders of croquettas.  Do NOT steal my croquettas.

For the purists, it is correct to state that Idaho does not really have its own native cuisine.   To the purists, pemmican might qualify as native cuisine.   Yes, you would have to travel to Spain/France to enjoy native Basque cuisine in the actual Basque region,  but given their history here in the west and their presence in Nevada and Idaho, it could be argued that their continued presence could qualify them as being native, or local, cuisine.

Given that the question asked was, ""what is the best cuisine in Idaho?"", I think that Basque cuisine qualifies as an acceptable answer.   Given that I'm posting something onto someplace on the internet, I would be disappointed if somebody didn't post an adequate if not overpowering refutation on me not just being wrong, but how horribly wrong I was.

Potato dishes could be considered local cuisine.

"“There’s this huge advantage to keeping our tax structure simple, and that’s primarily where all our retailers stand,” said Pam Eaton, president and CEO of the Idaho Retailers Association...“Right now, Idaho’s tax structure is one of the easiest in the nation,” Eaton said. “Everything’s taxed at the same rate.”

Moreover, some states that don’t tax groceries have added taxes onto other items that could be considered groceries, in an attempt to discourage consumers from, well, consuming them — such as candy and soda, because they’re considered unhealthy — or to raise revenue.

The problem is it isn’t always easy to determine what something is, Eaton said. “Is a Twix bar a cookie or candy?” she said. “Pretty soon you have people picking and choosing from manufacturers and making it an uneven playing field. If you want to take it off food, take it off all food and say you’re not going to come back every year because ‘something is unhealthy’ or ‘we need more revenue.’”

While some have suggested defining “groceries” as foods eligible to be purchased under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), it’s not that simple because some stores differ on what they consider eligible.

And bringing sales tax into the equation would exacerbate that, Eaton said. SNAP is run by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, while sales taxes are run by the Idaho State Tax Commission. “Health and Welfare isn’t like the Tax Commission,” she explained. “They don’t audit. If someone complains, they might pick up the phone and call the retailer and then the retailer can change it.” And there’s no penalty unless the offense is egregious or repeated, she added.

“The Tax Commission would not be like that,” Eaton continued. If a store didn’t think deli sandwiches should be taxed, and the Tax Commission disagreed, it could calculate what it thought the retailer owed in sales tax on deli sandwiches since the passage of the law and present the retailer with a bill for that amount, she explained.

...

Convenience stores took the same position a couple of years ago the last time there was such a bill, said Suzanne Budge, executive director of the Idaho Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association. “Convenience stores are a dynamic and challenging business with tremendously high turnover,” she said. “Taxability adds complexity they don’t need.”

Moreover, with COVID-19, lines between stores and restaurants have become increasingly blurred, with both offering meals for pickup to be heated up at home. “Look at Albertsons Marketplace and Whole Foods and restaurants that are doing family-style takeout,” Eaton said. “Why is one taxed and the other isn’t?”

Vendor allowance

In addition, eliminating the sales tax on food could end up costing the state money. Because calculating sales tax is complicated, 27 states offer a “vendor discount” to retailers to make up for the effort of calculating it. It ranges from 0.25% for Nevada to 5% for New York, and the amount is typically capped at a per month or per year amount for each retailer.

Idaho is one of 18 states (the other five don’t charge sales tax) that doesn’t offer a vendor discount. “We are the state’s tax collector, and we do it for free,” Eaton said.

That hasn’t been a problem because Idaho’s sales tax structure is relatively simple, Eaton said. But if it became complicated, retailers would want to change that, she said. “We want to make sure if anything is passed that everything that’s gray is black-and-white — fully defined in statute, and a vendor allowance because you’re making things more complicated.”

...

Finally, eliminating the grocery tax might end up hurting the very people it is intended to help — the low-income, said Alex LaBeau, president of the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry (IACI).

That’s because eliminating the grocery tax would also eliminate the grocery tax credit, and lower-income people generally make more on that than they spend on grocery taxes, LaBeau said. In particular, people who receive SNAP benefits are already not taxed on those items, he said. “That would be a net tax increase to them of a fairly substantial amount,” he said. When IACI last calculated the figures, in 2017, a family of four would need to spend about $7,000 per year, or $600 per month, to make it break even for them, he said.

“It sounds really good, but nobody’s put together a plan that makes holistic sense at the lower-income level,” LaBeau said.

"I disagree with both points.  I typically cook all my meals at home and shop at Winco.  Usually I cook from ingredients, not prepared.  Even if I cut my budget by 40% I would still save money by having the exclusion.  Even if you are getting SNAP, you would save money over the credit.

I also don’t think it would increase overhead of stores that much.  It would be a simple change in the registers to implement, and less each store would have to hold out to pay sales tax.

A more big girl series I’m OBSESSED with is the Charlie Davidson series. The first book is called The First Grave On The Right. It’s a perfect mix of humor, action, supernatural and spicy content. I’ve never recommended it to anyone that didn’t love it. The Grace Year is a book I really enjoyed recently, too! It’s shorter, not a series. Ted Lasso is my favorite tv show.

"I grew up here so I never realized just how local ""[fry sauce](https://www.inland360.com/lewiston-moscow/western-gourmet-fry-sauce-is-a-regional-fave-but-who-has-the-best-and-where-did-it-come-from/Content?oid=11373474)"" is. In the LC-Valley (North-Central Idaho) Sharp's Burger Ranch is the undisputed king of it, which they dub the ""Sharp's Special Sauce.""

Finger steaks down south, but it's all [bite-size steak](https://lmtribune.com/northwest/the-battle-of-the-bite-size-sizzles-valley-specialtys-origins-are-a-tantalizing-mystery/article_e579df19-eb69-57ef-98d1-1c502742f4a8.html) up here in north-central. If you are ever in the Lewiston area, I recommend [BoJack's](https://www.bojacksbroilerpit.com/) as the longest-running local bite-size serving restaurant (that I'm aware of...), though honestly Tomato Bros' ""Bites and Bites"" ( bite-size steak and with bite size-style portobello mushrooms) may be better, honestly.

Also, [Idaho nachos](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/idaho-nachos-5456976) are a recent regional edition you'll see popping up, especially up in CDA as a pub-style spin on an Idaho agricultural staple.

Also, as others have said: huckleberry. In Moscow/Sandpoint/CDA, there's a local-regional shop ([Panhandle Cone and Coffee](https://www.coneandcoffee.com/)) that serves some amazing locally crafted huckleberry ice cream. If you aren't afraid to drive a bit off the beaten path, Huckleberry Haven in Elk River is probably worth it.

Also, for a controversial addition to the ""Idaho"" list: in Clarkston, WA (the C in the LC-Valley) there's a long-running family-owned pizza joint that is pretty legit. That may not sound all that exciting, but their signature pie is: [The Shotsy](https://fazzaris.com/pizza/), a cracker crust mustard sauce pizza with kraut, onions, and polish sausage. I know how it sounds, but it's pretty friggin' amazing. It's definitely unusual and awesome if that's what you are going for.

Really though, North/North-Central Idaho is its own special animal. We are almost two (maybe three) different states here in the Gem State. North Idaho is much more PNW and Southern/South Eastern Idaho are definitely more intermountain west in my opinion.

So, I flew up here and bought a house before it was even built. Do to the massive amount of construction even here, the house was almost one year late. When I finally moved in it had appreciated over 125k and I never lived in the house. So, as a I said, 6 months can make a huge difference.

I had window film put up and the guy who did it said many home builders are purposely doing something wrong to houses they built. Therefore, they end up buying the house back from the owner and turning around and selling it at a huge profit.

"After I go on a rant like this I was get asked why I live in Idaho if I hate it so much. Like I said, I don't hate it. I just don't think it's worth the money. It's fine. A good solid average 5 out of 10.
My children live here with their mother so I'm making the best of it. I volunteer in the community, I've worked in the social work programs here and with the elderly. I've taken long bicycle rides, camped and hiked in the Hills, gone to open mic poetry nights and small shows, and jammed out with some pretty good people on guitars both on the street and in living rooms.

"Your earnest quality makes you seem like you'd be a good fit for more rural Idaho, but that's been my experience this small town folk all over the country. Ernest and kind. It's a good trait to have but it's not unique to this state.

You said your wife wants a more metropolitan experience. You can get theaters, museums and other culture in Boise, but from Boise get ready to drive for hours to get to lonesome rugged wilderness. The irony of Boise is that it is literally hours from anything better than average. Not the average means bad. It means average. The river is nice. The ski resort is pretty good. Thousands of people drive up to the tourist town of McCall on the lake. Slightly fewer people buy cabins in Donnelly. (Lake Placid NY isn't as crowded or commercialized and it has hosted the Olympics.) If you head up past the Lucky peak reservoir you got a bunch of nice little mountain lakes that you can pay to rent a campsite near, but my experience has shown me that's true of every state in the country. There's always a lake with some campsites around it where you can hear your neighbors blast Sweet home Alabama. Again, nothing special. 

As best I can tell Moscow Idaho is where it starts getting nice and from there North it's beautiful, but it's also a very small place and it's a part of the Redoubt, which means some very serious libertarian neighbors. If that's your thing think congrats you found your people. Moscow is a 5 and 1/2 hour drive from Boise, and they like it that way. You'd be better off living in Spokane Washington and visiting northern Idaho from there since it's a shorter drive. 

I know this is going to sound odd, but when you are looking at driving 3 hours to get to a place that feels really wild and untouched you might want to consider that 3 hours from New York City puts you all over some of the most beautiful places in the Northeast. 3 hours from Seattle Washington literally puts you in Canada. 3 hours from Miami puts you in alligator swamps with giant snakes or down into the Caribbean. Hell, from London two and a half hours on a train will put you in Paris France. My point is that Boise is so far from the amazing places idahoans will tell you about that it might as well not even be in the same state, and if you are willing to drive that far to find what you were looking for then you might as well live anywhere in the world.

Idahoans think this is the best place in the world. Nothing I've seen here has been unique to here. I moved here most recently from Ogden Utah where the mountains were incredible and it took 45 minutes to get to a desolate wilderness full of elk, moose, mountain lion, and the occasional Bear. People flew to visit from Germany and talked about how it was as beautiful as their Alps but less crowded and that the skiing was better.

In Idaho I'm told there are a lot of hot springs if you know where to go, but most of those hot springs are going to be well kept secrets and require a long hike to get to, and I know some pretty amazing Hot springs in northern Utah, and I learned about all of them only a few months after moving to town.

If you are coming from Texas then I think Idaho is probably an improvement, but if you are coming from Texas you probably think Texas is the best place in the world. My experience has been that the more defensive people are of where they are from the worse it is. New York City people think they are the most awesome in the world and everybody hates them. Texas has a worldwide reputation that they are proud of, but they are actually just the butt of a joke.

If you are looking at a job that pays really well and that's more important to you than where you live then Boise might be a good idea. There are indications that the housing bubble will deflate somewhat here pretty soon so if you can wait a little bit then great. But consider your cost of living here and then compare it to other cities in the country before you take a job.

Pojos has an arcade. Had? I haven't been in years, but there's tons of old arcade machines. Wahooz is similar, but less games and more amusements like minigolf and shit. It's cool, minigolf is a great date because you're both shit most likely and it gives lots of talk time.

"Sports are good, but not every kid is into classic sports. Some of the larger towns have youth orchestras and bands. Most places have quite good Parks and Rec summer programs, but you might struggle to find dance, art, or martial arts classes during the school year. Then again, you might. Roller skating is still very popular in Idaho, and I've been surprised by how many towns have a rink (varying quality, but present!) Most places have a local-enough ski hill, so winter sports are possible. Kayaking is good up north, but not down south. Thoroughly vet the SHIT out of youth groups and scouting groups before sending the kids. However, be aware that churches are huge in Idaho and a major source of social time for both adults and children.

Again, my recommendation (and this goes for all home schoolers) is look for a town with a well-regarded charter school or private school that could take over in middle school or high school.

"You are choosing to move somewhere extremely expensive that is pretty cool, but not really cooler than places that are less expensive. If your wife wants any kind of urban experience Idaho is not the right state. Boise is way overpriced and not particularly special. You can move to Logan Utah, Missoula montana, Burlington Vermont, or Portland Maine and probably be happier with the choice than you will be by moving to the most overpriced state in the United states. I'm not joking. Boise costs more cost of living versus income than anywhere else in the United States and it is cheaper to buy a home in Eureka California, where you have redwoods, mountains, and ocean.

Not trying to poo on idaho. It is a cool state. It has a lot going for it. I've had this conversation with many idahoans and they are right. Their state is wonderful. It is just not four times as wonderful as any other state. Did you know Tennessee is full of mountains forests and caves? Johnson City Tennessee has four seasons and no hurricanes or blizzards.

"Land in Northern Idaho is expensive and difficult to build. Some of that is because much of the land that is available is steep, woodeed, and hard to get to. Some of that is due to the mining waste that blankets the pandhandle. Living off the land can be done, but it requires advanced knowledge of how to make your water safe, and copious use of container gardening to gaurantee safe food.

Pre-built housing is expensive, especially if you consider what you are getting. Anything affordable is likely run down, and I don't mean ""clean and paint"" run down, but ""tear up a wall to fix the electrical"" run down.  Lots of home are sub par, and need a lot to bring them up to a livable standard unless you enjoy 300-400 dollar electrical bills and still being cold all winter. I had dangerous electrical. I still have plumbing that is holding together from sheer willpower and judicious use.

It's safe if you are white. If you aren't white, this isn't a great choice. Something I hate about N. Idaho, but a bunch of racists flooded in to get away from BrrrOoooooWWWnnnnn people (and they aren't shy about telling you that either, which is a trip to listen to.) 

If you are looking for modern amenities and easy access to the woods, you might try central Idaho no more than about an hour out of Lewiston.  St Maries might be a good choice for you. These are cheaper than the surrounding areas. However, you will need to plan monthly trips to ""town"" (CDA, Moscow/Pullman, Spokane) for the stores your wife wants. 

Look at a Satellite map to get a better idea of the geography, where the forests are and where they aren't.

You don't mention kids, but if you are thinking kids, take a good, long, hard look at our educational system. Boise area schools run the gamut. Idaho Falls area schools are good, nationally ranked last I checked. CDA schools are okay, not great. Must of Idaho's school system is failing and you, as the parent, will need to shore that up. 

Personally, if I were moving to this general region right now, I'd look at Chewelah in WA, and the surrounding area with greater interest than N. Idaho. Especially as Washington has better protections for workers, better access to medical care, better roads, and better schools.

I ended up moving to a college town for a while and absolutely hated it. I was also a park ranger for a time and I love nature, especially mountains and dense forests. 

Where I was raised it wasn’t uncommon to get a foot of snow, and coyotes were nightly visitors in my yard. I’m not looking to be a mountain man by any means, but if I didn’t have to see people unless I went out of my way to find them I wouldn’t mind either.

"That's the whole premise and argument for privatization!

I'm probably telling you something you already know, but it works like this:

1. Defund, reduce budgets year over year, or failed fund timely, or fail to fund in full; doesn't really matter which the result is the same. It's usually done in combos.

2. Watch as the office is skeletonized over time both in terms of staff and equipment. 

3. Complain about the State of affairs and inability for said department over a period of time. All the while gaslighting and making snide comments about how the state is unable to effectively serve the public, socialism is bad, government programs equal communism, etc.

3.a. bonus points if there is a natural disaster, inclement weather, pandemic!

4. Use media opportunities to wring your hands in lament about how state government has left your constituents in the cold. Point out that you've been a long time supporter of undermining said department, that this is proof you were right all along.

5. Work tirelessly to privatize any state's business, ensure you maneuver yourself onto contract selection committees, etc.

"Wow you are right. They shelved the bill.  They probably will still pass it, but I think the timing of everything becoming more expensive must have scared them off a little.  I couldn’t find any state tax rates on second homes though, just standard federal stuff.   But I don’t find lower property taxes inherently a bad thing. The way Idaho has it set up actually makes a lot of sense.  But after the last years explosive home prices in rural Idaho, things are going to be pretty shitty for a while.   It’s frustrating to see 1000s of empty houses, while I’ve been struggling to find one.

I’m not originally from Idaho but this same exact thing happened where I’m from and it ruined it.

This explains it state by state. It’s not a question of taxes for the employee, that’s straightforward. Idaho (and 4 other states) consider remote workers a nexus for corporate income taxes so having remote employees in Idaho would trigger state corporate income taxes for them.

"There are plenty of people who are going to disagree with that about rent control not helping.

A really common sense and easy to implement solution would be to extend the homeowner tax exemption to rental properties that are providing at least 1-year leases to residents.  I just had a neighboring family priced out of Boise because their rent was increased by $500 a month, and they couldn't afford that big of a jump.  The reason their landlord had to do that was based on property tax increases, which I do take with a grain of salt.

I'm actually not an anti-tax hawk, but essentially long-term rental properties are funding our local governments in Idaho, followed by homeowners, and then followed by commercial real estate.  Commercial real estate taxes only make up 28.8% of taxes collected from property owners, whereas homeowners make up the other 71.2%.  In 2002, that percentage was split 50-50%.

"Right?  But he was here when those talks were going on.  He recalls the history and the places where the people were coming from.
My biggest hope is that we recognize the value of experience from some of these old timers.  The are the fabric of the cloth our state was cut from.  These are the glory days, if you will.  And if he's honest, you'll be hearing his regrets and failures in lock step with his hopes for tomorrow.  And a plan.  People like this have the connection and pull to get things done in a very real way.  This is exciting.
A point here too, is that Idaho's glory days were not of some bastion of conservativism, but of blue collar hopes and dreams; hearty homesteaders, immigrants nearly all.  We've had our failures and challenges, for sure.  And we certainly could have done so much better, when it comes to our tribes, for instance.
