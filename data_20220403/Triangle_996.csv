"I never rented a house BUT my mom and stepdad rent a house and my sister and her husband rent a house. Both in Cary.

Both have horrible owners/ property managers.

My mom and stepdad - can't get the owner to fix anything like ever. My mom halfway fell through the floor and the owner was all woo that sucks...lets half ass fix it. So they did, my moms dishwasher stopped working and they sent a ""new"" one...well it was new to my mom. However, my mom and stepdad have a decent size house with 3 bedrooms 2 baths,  garage, and an extea living space and pay less than 1,300. 

Now my sister and her husband have a 3 bedroom 2 bath, extra living space, huge backyard and no garage. Their rent is close to 2k a month. They also aren't allowed to have 1 leaf in their yard or driveway or the owner call and says ""property management company"" says that the yard is a mess etc. Literally the leaves were falling in the fall and when my brother in a law was done working he'd  blow the leaves. The next day while he was working more would fall and he'd get a call you need to clean this now. Kind of ridiculous that these people don't understand how nature works. Also the owner of this house must have not taken care of their backyard very well because it was a breeding ground for mosquitoes and they never wanted to help pay for any pest control. They also refused to have the chimney cleaned and told my sister they weren't allowed to use the fire place ever.

Our rent is currently $1500, but I expect it to jump up significantly for the next tenant (we're moving next month). The manager has been very easy to work with and responsive to maintenance requests. We signed the lease without seeing the house as we were relocating from overseas, and we were pleasently surprised that it was nicer than the pictures. It was the first place we applied for, but I'm guessing there wasn't too much competition at the time - between Christmas and New Years in 2020.

"We rented in a 3BR/2BA with garage and yard (no fence) in Cary near green way for ca. $2K/month rent. They got a lot of applications and they moved fast in choosing us; they basically wouldn't really wait long for us to decided given the demand and number of applicants. We signed a 16 month lease within days of applying. The property is owned by private investor (person, not firm) out of state. The person is OK but we have to keep on them to get stuff done, especially since they're far away and  have't been in the house since they bought it.

"The trip was organized and funded by the Regional Transportation Alliance. RTA is a non-profit organization born out of an alliance between dozens of Triangle area chambers of commerce and 100+ regional businesses. It is essentially a chamberesque advocacy organization that advocates for regional transportation priorities on behalf of the business community. They periodically go on trips to other communities to determine best practices around regional transportation. Elected officials are obviously encouraged to go on these trips since their support is critical to all manner of regional transportation priorities.

"NC QUICK PASS TIPS AND TRICKS:

1. They are indirectly connected with the DMV. If invoices were sent to the wrong address you can dispute late fees. It's recommended to pay and dispute for a refund to avoid additional charges during the waiting process if denied. 

2. Every 2 years you can request 1 late fee waiver equal to $6 or one missed invoice. If invoices aren't arriving fast enough, you can OPT-IN to bill by email but it's up to you to keep it updated and check your spam folder. 

3. The fastest ways to get things done are in store, emailed disputes to ncquickpass@ncdot.gov, and online. If you pay to some third party via bank pay, USPS, or DOXO- you can be subject to late fees. 

4. Signing up for a private account means you basically waive your right to dispute account information. You'll get 35% off for doing everything QuickPass does with your account but it means maintaining a prepaid positive balance and keeping all information up to date yourself such as plate numbers, devices, emails, cards on file, etc. 

5. Be kind to employees!

"I put solar on our house when we bought it and rolled the cost into the mortgage. We've had it two years and it should pay for itself in another 6 unless Duke raises rates. 

I would echo buying your system instead of leasing it. We went with Southern Energy, a local B-corp that's fantastic. They did everything from site evaluation to permits to install and inspections. I basically had to write a check and hand a letter from a structural engineer I got in the mail to the inspector. Super easy and the easiest home improvement project I've even done.

We're with Duke and have net-metering setup. We generally don't over produce any month except April and sized the system that way because Duke will roll over credits every month if you over produce but reset it once a year in June or something like that. 

Our system has the SolarEdge monitoring built into the inverter that is separate from Duke. It's usually within a khw or two of Duke so thats a great backcheck on them.

We are in an area that is very stabile as far as the grid staying up, I think we've lost power for maybe 2 hours since we move in so there was no need to do a battery with the current net metering structure.

"For your reference: The Triangle is the metro area anchored by Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill. RDU is the international airport in the Triangle. RTP (Research Triangle Park) is a part of the Triangle where a lot of businesses are located (RTP proper is technically a specific business park in Durham, but the term is used colloquially to refer to the larger area of suburbs/business parks in the middle of the triangle). I’d look up the address of your office to see where it actually is, since it’s probably not actually at the RDU airport- whether it’s in downtown Durham or RTP will affect where you want to live if proximity is important to you.

"Rico (pictured 3rd), desperately needs for someone to foster or adopt him!

Rico has an incredible foster mom, but he gets overstimulated when he sees another dog on leash and his poor foster mom's arthritis can't handle his excitement. She's devastated as Rico is so loving and friendly with people. His favorite thing to do is snuggle with his mama and snore. He can play with toys on his own, but wouldn't be mad if you threw it for him a few times. 

When Rico doesn't see another doggo on leash, he does walk pretty well on leash! He just needs some work with redirection. For now, we'd like for him to be in a home with no other pets and older children. 

Rico loves people so much that he goes to the office with his mom every day. He's VERY loved there and is always welcome with open arms. Rico does get very nervous in a crate, but can stay out without being destructive.

We REALLY NEED someone to step up for Rico.

"Banks (pictured 2nd) needs a foster or adopter! 

Banks has been with Charley’s since mid November and hasn't gotten much attention. We're not really sure why, but we REALLY want to help her find a foster who can show her what it's like to live in a home. In her home prior to landing back in the shelter, we suspect she was kept in a crate the majority of the time. 

Banks is a beautiful 1 year old pocket pitty mix. She adores all people and will let you pet her for hours. She's all about the cuddles and snugs!

While Banks is dog selective, she's done well with several of the dogs at Charley's House. The source of her selectiveness is a lack of confidence and being scared of the world around her. Banks has been working on her confidence since she arrived mid November and has made great strides! Banks would do best with a playful, tolerant puppy. She is very intelligent and loves to train and learn new tricks.

Remi is a 6 year old mix breed saved from Gaston County Shelter. Charleys pulled him after he got multiple extensions and he had nowhere left to go. Remi's ideal foster lives within the RDU area. ""Ideally"" Remi needs to be an only dog or with someone able to crate/rotate as he is injured so no dog to dog interactions at this time. We also have not kid or cat tested him.

"That’s my point and other seem to disagree but I recall seeing so many news articles about those commuter trains in Florida and cars, etc getting hit by them because the people make mistakes or poor choices. I like the idea of rail and am all for it but it’s going to have its issues if people act the way they do around here.

I kid you not, I know VW does the sign and drive event, but I have seen someone behind the wheel, actively driving, on a video call on an iPad stuck to their dash, signing with both hands. No discrimination and I get having to do sign language to communicate, but that isn’t safe. When you actively let go of the wheel for tens of seconds with both hands, that’s a problem. Also saw someone hop up the curb and drive on the sidewalk about 50 feet. They were going 45 in a 35, it was a light curve, and they just went straight and onto the sidewalk with some grass and dirt in their grill as they eventually sped past me to run the light.

"Because it’s the difference between two biological functions. Testosterone can be injected into anyone and it will significantly increase their athletic ability over time - hence, why it’s banned like any other PED. Trans women are dosed at levels which cannot be accomplished in a female naturally - they’re basically taking testosterone due to the fact they have testicles and produce it naturally. It’s not their fault, and I certainly empathize with them, but we cannot destroy Women’s Sports to make a hyper minority of the population “feel included.” 

It’s the same argument as to why we have women’s sports to begin with. The work behind Title IX was because of the fact that males are biologically taller, faster, and far far stronger than females. They simply cannot compete against men in athletics because they are, biologically as a result of their sex, completely outclassed physically. Hence why including biological males in women’s sports is going to (eventually) completely erase biological females from the playing field because it’s the equivalent to allowing a portion of the population to take PEDs and wondering why they are absolutely blowing everyone else out of the water.

"I completely agree. This is not for everyone. 

For me, it’s like buying a car because I literally held off on replacing my 15 year old car to do solar. Im paying it off in less than 6 years so my payment is 3x my normal electric bill. However, I’ll have something that will provide a low cost service for the next 20-30 years. When I decide to replace my car, it will be electric and my “gas” cost is going to be minimal. I see it as prepaying electricity & having a backup power source. 

The solar folks I talked to always included the battery as part of the proposal before I even asked. For me, it was a must have because I am permanently WFH (pre-pandemic) and have power outages when someone sneezes. I’m also on well water; no power= no water. This is the main reason I went solar. 

I did want to address reporting. My system has enphase micro inverters which has the enphase app reporting on total production at the panel level. I’ve compared that to the Tesla battery reports, which gives you real time production & usage. Finally, the electric company bill shows my usage and over production. I noticed a discrepancy, which led to some adjustments, but it all lines up now.",t2_2wao032f,i-am-a-neutron-star,0,1648763682.0,0,t1_i2wl3x8,i2wl3x8,False,radargunbullets,t3_tt3cyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/tt3cyn/anyone_have_net_metering_use_a_company_called_nova/,Anyone have net metering?

"> There is no evidence to support claims that allowing transgender student athletes to play on the team that fits their gender identity would affect the fairness of the sport or competition.

This is hilarious. There is no evidence because it’s a fairly new phenomena. These studies take years to complete.

You are out of your mind if you think that a biological male doesn’t have an advantage over a biological female. 

Don’t believe me? Check each of the following facts pulled from scientific articles:

Men have about 90% greater upper-body strength, a difference of approximately three standard deviations (Abe et al., 2003; Lassek & Gaulin, 2009). The average man is stronger than 99.9% of women (Lassek & Gaulin, 2009). Men also have about 65% greater lower body strength (Lassek & Gaulin, 2009; Mayhew & Salm, 1990), over 45% higher vertical leap, and over 22% faster sprint times (Mayhew & Salm, 1990).",t2_69hk9qri,narutard6,1,1648761268.0,0,t1_i2wezfr,i2wezfr,False,RaleighDSA,t3_tsyxlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/tsyxlj/trans_solidarity_rally_on_april_10th/,Trans Solidarity rally on April 10th!,/r/triangle/comments/tsyxlj/trans_solidarity_rally_on_april_10th/i2wezfr/,3,r/triangle,0,3

Reading these comments is frustrating and sad. 

Y'all, I'm a proud Southerner. I love North Carolina and I love my home. I'm not coming in here as a transplant trying to change anybody's mind. I'm a local asking people to just be kind, and when you can't be kind, be rude in private to your friends. That's normal. 

I'm not asking you to stop thinking for yourself.

I'm not asking you to never complain about stuff you dislike. 

I'm not even asking you to never disagree with someone on reddit. 

But please, before you comment, think very hard about whether you'd want your loved ones to read it if they are trans and they haven't told you yet. That is literally all I'm asking.

"> Im replying to this upper level comment because you’ve been prolifically spreading misinformation in this thread.

I disagree and believe that’s what you’re doing. 

> Just to clarify, biologists believe that there are dozens of biological sexes. Biological sex is an incredibly complicated subject. 

No, it’s not, and the extreme minority of individuals who are born intersex does not change that. [0.018% of individuals are born as “intersex,”](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12476264/) and the majority of those conditions self correct over the course of a puberty cycle or beforehand. 

Let me put it to you this way: people have ten fingers. In very rare instances, some people are born with eight or twelve, but it doesn’t mean that it’s incorrect to say that people have ten fingers. 

> What you are doing is taking a very flattened view of what sex is and then abusing that view to enforce your socially learned opinions onto others.

These aren’t opinions, these are facts. Trans women are different from women, and trans men are different from men. That doesn’t deny their existence - on the contrary, I’d say it’s healthier to be honest with who they are. Lying to them and permitting them to lie to themselves creates a delusional false reality that only they themselves and their immediate enablers subscribe to. A trans woman is a trans woman, and a trans woman is different from a women. Different does not mean bad, and they’re still people just like you and me. But to pretend as though they’re women is to lie to them, and it’s how we end up with ridiculous situations like trans women dominating the field in women’s events.  

> When you say “women are women” the onus is then on you to describe what “women” are and who to exclude. 

Adult human female. There, I’ve described it. A female has two X chromosomes and a vagina. In very rare instances, some do not, but that doesn’t mean that it’s ok or even rational to throw what occurs in 99.982% of the population out the window. And again, your denial of reality isn’t doing anything but harming them, substantially, in the long run by preventing them from being able to “live their truth,” which is that they’re a trans woman or a trans man, and different from a woman or man. To be an “ally” isn’t to indulge people in every one of their fictions or falsities, it’s to accept them for who they are and champion EVERYTHING about them. To call a trans woman a woman is to deny what she is - transgender. 

> You’ve simply chosen to exclude trans women in this argument despite the deluge of information to the contrary.

I have yet to see an even remotely convincing argument - using science or just basic reason and mental health discussion - which disputes my position here. I love transgender people in the same way I love anyone else and it’s BECAUSE I love them that I refuse to lie to them or allow them to lie to themselves about who they ACTUALLY are. You (well not necessarily you but anyone who is reading along) were born a man and now you’re a woman, and are therefore a trans woman. Live in that honestly and you’ll find yourself IMMENSELY more satisfied with your daily life and a lot of the mental health problems that come from stressing over whether or not you’ll “pass” as a “real woman” will evaporate. Just be who you are and be proud of what it is that makes you unique. It’s enough.

Edit: and let me add that this is coming from someone who has had these conversations with well adjusted, happy transgender people. They feel the exact same way I do but are TERRIFIED of people *like you* who seek to vehemently bully and deny their existence by lying about what it is that they are.

"Been approached multiple times by these kinds of folks.  In every case they were tied to a lender.  Some of them were experienced roofing companies.  Some not so much.  They are partnered with the bank. They all try to sell you on lower power bills.  My understanding is Duke is trying to back out of all this in Florida.  I am not sure about NC. It relies on Duke offering the same rate forever. I don't see it happening. 

I totally disagree with this strategy.  In each case they were approving me for around 40k.  The argument they made is it will pay for itself.  I don't think so.  First I would never go in debt for 40k to save a couple hundred a month.   Second there are mountains of complaints that I have seen were the company over estimates the output of the panels.  Some folks are left with the original power bill and the payments on the solar install. 

I argued about getting a battery, None of them were interested in that path.  They all want you to ""use the grid"" as your battery.  Third thing was no real accurate way to monitor the output and how much is going back into the grid.  

I elected to buy my own panels instead.  I have several 2kw batteries that can charge while in use. I am not trying to power my entire house. I offload power to those batteries for a lot of my stuff I run during the day that is 110.  It has saved me some money over the last 2 years.

"How about the [American Psychological Association (APA)](https://www.apa.org/pi/LGBT/resources/policy/issues/transgender-exclusion-sports), the largest scientific and professional org of psychologists in the US?

>Transgender children vary in athletic ability, just as other youth do. There is no evidence to support claims that allowing transgender student athletes to play on the team that fits their gender identity would affect the fairness of the sport or competition (ACLU, 2020). In February 2021, the National Coalition for Women & Girls in Education issued a statement supporting transgender and nonbinary students’ full and equal participation in all education programs and activities, including sports (see Resources section below). The American Psychological Association took the same position in February 2020 (APA, 2020).

>A person’s gender identity is how each person self-defines their gender. This may or may not be consistent with the sex someone was assigned at birth (APA, 2009). Gender identity is central to how children and adolescents perceive themselves (APA 2015). Requiring transgender youth to athletically compete on teams based on their sex/gender assigned at birth is the same as banning them from athletic competition entirely (ACLU, 2020).

"Duke energy is my utility and I have a PV system with a battery. The way it works for me is that I had to take out a big loan (or pay cash) for the system, and now I just pay the difference in what I produce vs consume every month. I’m still new so I don’t have a full year of data. My system started operating in July 21’ and was fully functional in late Jan 22’ due to a delay in battery delivery and a couple of issues that impacted production. 

Currently, I average 1350 kWh of usage. For the month of Feb, I used 222 kWh from
Duke energy more than I produced. My bill was $38.00. For the month of March, I used 15.9 kWh of usage from Duke energy, so it should be a very small bill on top of the connection fee. 

My 3 cents: 

1. If you are part of a co-op, check out their rules. For my folks, it is really not worth getting a system.

"Honestly? I wouldn't buy any if you're going to be living in your house for less than 10-20 years. The initial install is quite expensive no matter how many discounts or rebates you get, and your return on investment is generally going to be 8-15 years depending on how many panels you need.

They're a great investment if you want to help the environment or are planning on staying in the home long enough that they pay for themselves and more, but financially speaking they're a really long-term investment. I like mine, but this is my ""forever home.""

A couple of things to be aware of: a south-facing roof is going to generate a lot more energy than an east or west facing roof. I wouldn't bother buying solar panels if I didn't have a south (or mostly south)-facing roofline where the majority of panels can be installed. That's thanks to the track of the sun.

And the other thing to be aware of is that solar panels get HOT. And sometimes that means, especially in August here lately, that there may be days when they stop generating electricity at all because they've become too hot to function.

"Net Metering applies when you have solar panels installed on your property.

"I'm talking specifically about being called a ""girl"" in the workplace. My original post, upon rereading, is coming off harsher than I intended, however I want to clarify that in a casual context using ""girls"" doesn't really carry the same weight as in the workplace. 

However, I work in a male-dominated space and I have almost never heard a man or men being referred to as ""boys"". (And im only writing ""almost"" to leave room for error, but off the top of my head I can't think of a single instance). It's definitely not at the top of my battles to pick and I definitely dont carry any resentment toward my coworkers who do say ""girls"" in the workplace; however, it's definitely a disparity that grates on me because I come across it so often. Just today I was called a ""girl"" by a coworker lol.

I used to work on a team that at the time only had women on it, and our accomplishments were announced like ""look at how our team of girls are crushing it!"" We are all in our 30s and 40s, so really not even young women. It's just really demoralizing to be referred to as a child in a professional setting. 

I don't think anyone is inherently evil or whatever to call working women ""girls"" but I think it's something we can all be mindful of and improve on to be more respectful in a professional setting. It's definitely something I've also had to consciously work on myself. And in the context of this particular post, if I were looking for a similar coworking space, it would not even occur to me to search using ""girls only,"" because it's a professional environment.

" 3 major metropolitan areas exist in NC. All are located within 90miles hive or take from one or the other. All are located on one major Interstate, 85 in Charlotte, then 85 merges with 40 in GSO. 
   As NC continues to urbanize, what's going on in Raleigh and Charlotte on a scale such as this, effects all of us. The ""Triangle"" has landed some huge companies that will change it forever. 
  Should we be discussing transit that connects all three metros.  Atlanta and Charlotte are in preliminary planning for a high speed train because we know that 85 will not handle future growth. Ever heard of ""Charlanta""? The Brookings Institute believes that in say 30yrs Atlanta and Charlotte will somewhat merge in terms of development along 85 becoming solid between the two cities.

"Yeah, I don't disagree that is excessive.  My guess is they are assuming someone will spend 1/3 of their monthly expenditures on rent, meaning someone with 25 years' worth of rent saved would be able to actually pay rent for 8 years.

Again, it's excessive, but I could see 15 years' worth of rent (5 years' worth of expenses) for someone with no income as perfectly reasonable, and that is only because the eviction process is so tedious.  Again, assuming this is an ""or"" proposition, and the prospective tenant doesn't make enough income to cover rent.  If the tenant earns enough income, they don't have to show any liquid assets.

With all of that being said, the cost of living is certainly an issue, and I certainly blame apartment complexes that raise their rent in excess of inflation, but don't necessarily blame them for underwriting criteria to protect their cash flow.",t2_kw1a3aq2,General-Life4920,0,1648641824.0,0,t1_i2pdq23,i2pdq23,False,UnicornDream3r,t3_tqvdj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/triangle/comments/tqvdj8/whats_your_rent_hike_been_like/,What’s your rent hike been like?,/r/triangle/comments/tqvdj8/whats_your_rent_hike_been_like/i2pdq23/,2,r/triangle,0,2

"I actually live in Eastern North Carolina and have seen outrageous rents here.  (A tiny house costing $1500 which is higher than my mortgage for a place that is probably 3 times the size.)

My parents died a little over a year ago, and their property has remained vacant.  We are finally clearing it out and have someone moving in next month.  The place needs some minor repairs, but nonetheless, we are only charging $600 for rent where similar places around here are much higher.  Does not include any utilities or anything, but we are not going to price gouge people that need a place to stay.  As long as we have enough to cover taxes and the basics, we are okay with renting it out with just a little something extra each month.  No reason to be greedy.

"We have a pool with a poolhouse, but the pool is not cleaned with any appropriately frequent interval during the open season and I am legit scared to go into the pool house because it is so dirty and unmaintained. 

We have tennis courts; the lighting system is non-functional, one court is missing the net, one of the gates has been removed from the surrounding fence, and the courts themselves are seriously overdue for a repave with 1""+ cracks and root raises all over. 

They do provide lawn maintenance, but all that involves is mowing, edging, and leaf blowing, no fertilizing or overseeding, and they provide the service so infrequently that the property often appears overgrown and unmaintained. They do insure the outside, but I have a starling nest in my exterior dryer duct outlet and rotting exterior window sills, and the combination of carpenter bees and woodpeckers has rendered most of the wood siding and stair/walkway railings to sawdust held together by latex paint. 

Ice melt, as well as allegedly a shovel, is provided for the winter season. That's it, and there's actually no shovel. No snow removal included in the budget or carried out by the landscaping crew following winter weather. If it weren't for myself shoveling (with my own snow shovel that I had the foresight to purchase a week before it snowed for the first time this year) and salting the front walk and stairs, my neighbors and I would have contended with a nice sheet of ice over concrete for at least a few days.

Chesapeake Landing in Cary, no sense laying this out without identifying info. Managed by Wilson Property Management. Its got good bones and for the most part has been an enjoyable tenancy, only one nuisance neighbor who moved out/was evicted a few months after I moved in. My particular unit was recently renovated by the previous owners. I can only speak to the condition of my building and the other buildings immediately adjacent, I will say they have been doing new roofs on some of the buildings in other parts of the complex, but mine hasn't been one of them.

"That is not my point at all. 

Yes, owning a home is better for your long term financial prosperity. That's because real estate is an investment. When you pay a mortgage payment, you build equity. 

But, at the end of the day, we all have to live *somewhere*. Not everyone can afford the up-front costs and recurring costs that are required when you own a home. In many cases, as I have pointed out *several times*, the average cost of rent per month is *significantly less* than the average cost of owning a home per month. 

Just saying ""buy a home, it's cheaper"" to people who are battling high rent prices is NOT a solution, or even helpful.

"Okay, but do you have to pay $30k for a new roof? $10k for new windows? $12k for a new HVAC? Thousand for appliance replacement/repair? And this is just common, big ticket repair stuff. It doesn’t include the monthly expenses of maintaining a home, or any kind of actual improvement/renovation. 

I’m not saying owning a home isn’t “better”. It is. But annual expenses to owning a home are not really less than renting. Again, the benefit to owning a home is that you build equity. So ultimately you are getting back (hopefully) what you put into it. That doesn’t, however, make it more easy to afford on a monthly basis.

You want to be close to RTP to minimize your commute. You should look at some of the luxury apartment buildings in downtown Durham, Cary, or Morrissville.
