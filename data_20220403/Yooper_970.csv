Within an hour it was removed and I was banned, with zero contact with the mods. I didn't argue at all and they haven't responded to my request for an explanation. 

Unfortunately, the museum only did tours and the next tour didn't start for 45 minutes and was 45 minutes long, so we didn't actually get to go in. We decided to head to the town instead. 

The nearby town had a couple dozen pasty shops. It's really popular in many on the mining towns in Mexico. Here's a pic of the menu of the one we ate  at. I had the chorizo because they were out of the potato and beef. It was really good. Thinner than a UP pasty, but the flaky crust was nearly identical

"Wow! That sucks, Frosty. I am very sorry that has been your experience. I can not claim anything like that, but I have heard many similar stories here and I am not surprised. I find the hospitality here to be the superficial single serving kind. Great public manners and small talk; but, nothing moving beyond that to something deeper. A lot of the friends-family relationships are preformed from birth, very old, deep, and closed.

I have had friends and visiting family members who are POC or openly gay that have experienced a range from coldness to active hostility in the community. 

On an unrelated note, I have noticed a disturbing habit of everybody knows each other’s business. But, when things are not okay and need intervention, “that’s none of our business”.

"The Eben Ice caves.  It’s about a 30min drive out, but totally worth it.  Caves should be nice this year too.  Typically quite a few people there, but most are locals cause it’s in the middle of no where.  Also, you used to have to park on a sharp corner, then cross private property to get there.  The owners of said property wound up inheriting money, so they invested in a parking lot on their property so people could park there for free.  They also pay to have portojohns brought in.  They had a lot of little kids coming to their house previously who needed to use the bathroom & they felt bad.  Portojohns are free to use, but they ask for donations to help.  They sell, or used to sell, hot cocoa & snacks on some days to help keep the property up to snuff.  Wonderful people & beautiful place to visit! Worth the 30-40min drive.

I did find some interesting articles about the history Blaney Park, which is right down the road. The area was logged heavily until 1926. Once they were finished logging, they decided to convert the logging town of Blaney into a resort called Blaney Park. It operated as a resort into the 1960s.

If you're interested in the history of this area, I found this book which looks like a pretty comprehensive record of the area:

"I know this is old but just stumbled on this post while looking for restaurant suggestions for my family. Went to Haushouse in summer 2020 right after mountain biking for 5 hours straight, not knowing a single thing about the place. I was starving, thirsty, and cramping all over so any place sounded amazing. I walked in and immediately noticed how nice the staff was dressed and how fancy the inside looked. Being in sweaty stinky workout/biking attire, I immediately told the hostess that I am severely underdressed for this place and will be leaving. She insisted that I am fine and my appearance is no problem and was extremely friendly and accommodating. I said ok but I'm going to eat everything put in front of me and need a pitcher or water or 2. I sat there by myself in this nice bar, facing the gorgeous lake, while sitting in my soaked and stinky gear and everyone could have not had made me feel more welcomed. I had one pint, 2 pitchers of water, full steak meal and dessert, and I devoured it all like a champ/slob.

"I did a little bit of digging. I see a lot of family history, but I haven't found much of the story of the gas station and cottages yet though. 

Looks like it was owned by Edward John McGuire Jr, who moved to the area in 1952 and passed away in 2009. It then transferred to his wife until she passed in 2018. Their sons sold it to the current owner in 2019. 

[Edward McGuire's Obituary.](https://www.fausettfh.com/obituary/651105)

[Gloria Gene's Obituary](http://www.mbfuneralhome.com/obituary/gloria-mcguire)

[https://i.imgur.com/K4BQmyK.png](https://i.imgur.com/K4BQmyK.png)

  
It looks like it was built around the same time as US 2 was being put in in the 1940s. My best bet is that it was used for the road workers and then the tourists after the road was finished. I imagine that it fell into disrepair as Edward and Gloria started getting up in years.

Best bet to try to find out more information would be to contact the current owners and see if they know much about the history. It looks like Linda Hinkley has a light social media presence. Edward and Gloria's son Stephen passed away in 2019, but David might still be around too.

There is also the Newton Township Historical Society that might have some information about it as well.

"Kingsley north, they do amazing custom work. I went in there with a vintage 1940s family heirloom and another ring with some rare cut diamonds they were extremely excited to work with because they apparently don’t cut stones that way anymore. They were so excited to meet the recipient of the project. They combined the two and came up with a beautifully crafted one of a kind piece. Sadly the engagement ended and I gave the ring back and my ex died soon after, but I get to peak at it from time to time when I visit his family.

"If things like this are going to happen and people are going to move to the area, they need to invest in the community. That's the only way to prevent gentrification while also revitalizing an area. Keep the money local, if you own a business, pay your people well. If you become a landlord, take care of your properties and offer them at an actual affordable price. Purchase goods and services locally as much as possible. These towns were once much larger than they are now. I hope they can improve while also making it possible for the local population to remain living there. Honestly, life is getting so expensive that the only people who can afford to put money into a community are people who are already wealthy and have no real ties to the area. That is simply not okay, but the solution to that is more than I'm competent to figure out.

"I live on a river with multiple Airbnbs on it that opened in the last two years. Now, when I walk on my deck in the summer I frequently see men and women — completely bare assed — taking a piss on the other side of the river, in what is effectively someone else’s front yard. That yard isn’t an Airbnb, it’s just a convenient spot for someone from down river in a kayak to drop trow. 

The push against letting local municipalities set rules for where and when these businesses can operate is heavily backed by the Michigan Realtors Association. They, obviously, profit by selling homes and artificially increasing demand (remember, these people renting them out don’t want to actually live in these places), thereby raising property prices while simultaneously lowering the intrinsic value of living around these homes-turned-businesses (nobody wants to wake up to strangers pissing in their yard). Most lawmakers don’t want to allow local regulation through ordinances because there’s a risk of losing that lobby and the money that comes with it despite actual resident homeowners (their constituents) being vastly against Airbnbs in their area. Likewise, municipalities don’t want to enact laws to regulate them that will just be shot down at the state level or open them up to litigation. It’s ruining homeownership both for current homeowners and for prospective homeowners who are now priced out of the market. 

That’s all beside the fact that Airbnb has gotten embroiled in some controversies (such as allowing people to not rent to minorities for far too long) and has struggled to maintain profitability quarter over quarter.

"I'll just put the same comment I gave the other day in this very sub:  


""Outside investment doesn't really translate into money coming and staying in the area. It certainly doesn't translate into those people making $10 an hour having more money.  
  
Investors want a return greater than their investment and if they don't live and spend and get taxed in the place of their investment, that is a net outflow of money from the community.  
  
This is doubly so for investments like short term rentals. It is simply the purchase of capital that produces value simply by existing and being rented. There's no appreciable creation of jobs; whatever small increase in contract work or property management does little to offset the increase of housing prices or the net outflow of money.  
  
This compounds as an area gets more gentrified. Housing gets too expensive for workers to live there, new businesses targeted to wealthier visitors and new arrivals supplant older businesses. Any change in prevailing wage is peanuts compared to rising costs.  
  
Eventually it's a big ""sorry, you don't earn enough for some real estate speculator to continue living where you have for decades."" No matter if the longtime residents made a community that was attractive in the first place. You can't put the care and respect for their community and environment into a balance sheet both because it doesn't fit accounting and critically because it's a form of commons. No one owns it and everyone benefits from it. The capitalist has to enclose and privatize the commons to extract more value from it, even it destroys what was there to begin with.  
  
Make no mistake, gentrification destroys communities, sands down all the weird parts, and leaves hollowed out neighborhoods of inflated real estate in its wake. Doesn't matter to the investors, they secure the bag and move onto the next town.  
  
And this isn't even touching on how gentrified areas create more real criminalization of how people are used to living there, how it imports and imposes culture that is hostile to what existed before and usually made the place nice in the first place.  
  
Everyone loses with wealthy investors coming into a small town unless they have the money to buy up property and ride the wave themselves.""",t2_13zcgx,PorcelainPorpoise,0,1643095013.0,0,t1_hu4jn3d,hu4jn3d,False,getflapjacked,t3_sbnydj,https://www.reddit.com/r/yooper/comments/sbnydj/its_happening_everywhere/,It’s happening everywhere.,/r/yooper/comments/sbnydj/its_happening_everywhere/hu4jn3d/,4,r/yooper,0,4
"Now in Marquette after a couple of winters (and 20 years of summers) at our place on East Bass Lake.  I found it a solid community.  We had five winter days without power a couple of years back (one reason we ended up buying a place in Marquette) and spent a lot of time at the warming shelter in the firehall.  People couldn't have been nicer.  One friend brought over an extra generator and hooked us up.  Two guys from the township came to the house just to check if we were okay and if we needed anything.  I found the local supermarket met my needs about 80% of the time and it wasn't a bad run to Escanaba when I needed an Aldi fix.  Some decent restaurants and the best pizza in the county.  A good hardware store.  Easy access to the best trout streams in the U.P.  

I was in a situation where I had to go into Marquette nearly every day, and there were a some days when I had to white-knuckle it through whiteouts and a some other days when I just turned around and went back.  But not an issue unless you need to go to Marquette.  

Downsides--besides the risk of extended power outages (if you're really going to live there, get a generator that hooks up to your propane tank):  some of the worst income inequality in the state.  People like you and me, and others much wealthier, living on lakes.  People who can't afford to rent anywhere else living in pretty bad apartments on the old base.  I once asked a teacher what she thought of the schools and she said the kids were really great but there were a significant number of parents with drug issues--mostly meth.

"In Michigan, especially the UP, short term rentals do not pay the same assessments other lodging establishments do that fund area convention and visitors bureaus. 

So, if Munising’s CVB (picking an example) pays to be a part of Pure Michigan, puts a ton of advertising out there, then these short term rentals benefit from that marketing. In my neck of the woods, short term rentals generated over $1 million in revenue in 2021. If they were hotels (or opted to pay the assessment) it would have been over 50 grand going back into the CVB to help with more marketing, hosting more events and in general having a much, much larger impact on area tourism. 

We’re in the Wild West days of short term rentals. That’s all before you even start looking at who owns the rentals, what’s happening to housing markets, zoning violations, etc. It’s great in theory, but it’s turned into its own business and not just random people sharing their houses. It’s not an efficient way to put money in local economies.

"Outside investment doesn't really translate into money coming and staying in the area. It certainly doesn't translate into those people making $10 an hour having more money.

Investors want a return greater than their investment and if they don't live and spend and get taxed in the place of their investment, that is a net outflow of money from the community.

This is doubly so for investments like short term rentals. It is simply the purchase of capital that produces value simply by existing and being rented. There's no appreciable creation of jobs; whatever small increase in contract work or property management does little to offset the increase of housing prices or the net outflow of money.

This compounds as an area gets more gentrified. Housing gets too expensive for workers to live there, new businesses targeted to wealthier visitors and new arrivals supplant older businesses. Any change in prevailing wage is peanuts compared to rising costs.

Eventually it's a big ""sorry, you don't earn enough for some real estate speculator to continue living where you have for decades."" No matter if the longtime residents made a community that was attractive in the first place. You can't put the care and respect for their community and environment into a balance sheet both because it doesn't fit accounting and *critically* because it's a form of commons. No one owns it and everyone benefits from it. The capitalist has to enclose and privatize the commons to extract more value from it, even it destroys what was there to begin with.

Make no mistake, gentrification destroys communities, sands down all the weird parts, and leaves hollowed out neighborhoods of inflated real estate in its wake. Doesn't matter to the investors, they secure the bag and move onto the next town.

And this isn't even touching on how gentrified areas create more real criminalization of how people are used to living there, how it imports and imposes culture that is hostile to what existed before and usually made the place nice in the first place.

"In the beginning, most were willing to go into lockdown so that we could flatten the curve (aka lessen the impact on hospitals).  Somehow, politics got injected into the situation and now no one even comprehends the impact that this is having on healthcare delivery.

All of the beds are full, so what do you think is going to happen to the next person in the community who has a stroke, or an acute episode of appendicitis?  Who might be having some diverticulitis coming on? Or have that weird warm redness expanding across their skin after they got a tiny little scratch?    Those patients, the ones that have immediate life threatening conditions that can not be anticipated or ignored, are now in REAL jeopardy.  Those patients are going to have to be transported to the nearest open hospital (raising the risk of mortality) or they are going to sit in an ER being taken care of nurses who are not normally taking care of that population for more than 6 hours (raising the risk of mortality).

Across the nation, this is happening.  Not just here in the UP.  There is about to be a catastrophic failure of our national healthcare system.  The best advice that I can give to everyone is if you ever expect to need healthcare anytime in the future, protect the system now.  

Get your vaccine.  Get your boosters.  Wear a mask in public and respect social distancing.    This is a public health crisis.  This isn’t a political issue.

Might I also add, if you know a healthcare worker, please know that this is the most difficult point in our careers now.  I never thought, in my 20+ years of nursing, that I would see the day when the public feels entitled to yell at me in public, spit on me and question my motives for being in healthcare.   Maybe reach out to that person that you know who is in healthcare and offer to buy them a beer.  Give them a safe space to talk, or to talk about something other than work.

Thinking back there were a few possible ""insurance fires"" back around that time and none of those businesses ever came back.

"The below press release comes from the Alger County Sheriff's Office regarding the standoff reported earlier:

""At approximately 12:30 pm, the two Alger County Deputies attempted to serve an Order For Transport/Examination for a psychological evaluation on a 44 year old male at his residence in Rock River Twp.

As the deputies approached, the suspect became resistive and attempted to flee back into his residence.  One deputy attempted to gain control of the suspect when the suspect began to strike him with a piece of rebar as the taser was deployed.

The second deputy attempted to gain control of the suspect as the suspect was only minimally affected by the taser.  The suspect was able to break free and gain entry into his house.  The second deputy immediately followed the suspect into the house.

As the suspect was able take possession of a long gun and point it at the deputy from inside the house.  The deputy immediately retreated falling off of the porch in an attempt to gain distance.  Both deputies were able to retreat to a safe location where they called for immediate assistance.

The suspect remained in the house.  Several officers of the Michigan State Police as well as additional deputies from the Alger County Sheriff Office were immediately dispatched to assist.  The Michigan State Police Emergency Support Team was deployed to assist with the apprehension of the suspect.

At approximately 6:30pm the suspect fled the house and was taken into custody by the MSP Emergency Support Team.  The suspect was subsequently transported to U.P. Health System in Marquette for evaluation.

"It's advised to get a full set, but I never bought 4 new.  I bought 2 new each year, put my new in the front for my front wheel drive and moved the previous years  snow tires  crossed to the back.

If you have summer tires and can switch you could get much more life out of the tires, but I didn't and ran my snows all year round.

2 new snows for my car was between $100-150.


To answer, two snows will do the job, but remember your back end can swing out due to less traction than the front.

"Snow tires make a major difference.

All season tires are really no season tires or tires that are mediocre at everything.   They aren't great summer performance tires, and they aren't good winter tires, but they are cheaper than having to buy 2 sets (at one time).

Winter tires out preform all season tires in snowy conditions.

My old beater I drove in college would get 2 new snows a year (I drove with them on all year, I know not supposed to. UT I was poor)   my Bday is right before winter so I'd put the 2 new up front, and last years in back and rarely had issues.   So even 2 new snows are better than no snows.
