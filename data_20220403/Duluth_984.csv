As an adult a lot of your new friends will be made through your interests and how you get out and pursue them. It's a different thing and it takes time. It's the same for everyone though. I still have some childhood friends that live close but I also wanted to pursue cycling more and it took a good while to find new friends with that.... But it did happen and I'm pretty plugged into the scene now.

"Everyone on my mom's side went to school here, and the high school across the avenue which is now a parking lot.  They were in the last few classes before the school was rebuilt at it's current location on Rice Lake Road. Cathedral, when it was downtown, was definitely not the expensive, college prep school that Marshall is today. It was mostly lower-income kids from downtown or the central hillside whose families belonged to the nearby Catholic Churches. Mostly though, since Central HS and Washington Jr High were only a few blocks away, there were lots of fights between the Central and Cathedral kids, although most all lived in the same neighborhoods. Lots of kids went to Cathedral for junior high and Central for high school. 

I went on a mini-tour of the remaining building that's the Damiano Center and you can see how narrow the staircases are.

"I see the gun control as the biggest issue for Red rural voters. Pull issues like Assault Weapon Bans off of the Democratic platform and more rural voters would flip. I get that firearm homicides are terrible and need correcting, but we have a lot of other major issues that affect A LOT of people. Like police brutality and racism, drug epidemics, and a middle class crippled by debt and high cost of living. Issues that the republican party is happy to ignore as long as they get votes.

Granted what republican voters don't understand is that the republican party loves gun control, but during the campaign all they have to say is that they ""support 2A"" and boom rural voters go red. Seriously go look at some Republican candidates websites, most literally just say nothing more then that they support 2A.

No, he shouldn't ""probably"" know. He (or his treasurer) should *definitively* know. It's required by law. You have to keep track of every entity that donates to a political fund, and file a report including everyone who donates over $100 in a calendar year.

"When you say labor, do you mean organized labor? Because organized labor comprises less than 3% of Americans - of which less than half of that 3% vote Democrat. So what I hear when folk say 'labor' and mean 'organized labor' is 'focus on winning that 0.5 - 1% of the vote'.,

Which is bullshit. You don't win elections by targeting the 1% better than the other side - just ask Hillary. Best dataops money could buy. Shit brand and product.

Stroll down Main Street in Virginia and it becomes easy to see why anyone would go Republican. Virginia is more depressing to me than Gary. At least Gary's got some kickass pierogis to eat.

The solution is so clear, so simple, and so easy to implement, that it boggles my mind why no-one's done it yet.

"I don't understand how the dems abandoned the unions when the vast majority of right to work states are traditionally red states (Wisconsin and Washington being, generally, the outlier among them). The GOP with the federalist society punched up Supreme Court nominees that lead to the Janus v. AFSCME decision. It doesn't make any damn sense.

Maybe they took union support for granted which led to the massive shipment of jobs overseas, which then led to unions and the workforce 'taking what they can get' so to speak. The Dems aren't perfect, but clearly they did themselves no favors voting GOP. The GOP hasn't bolstered employment or jobs, let alone union jobs.

"Not completely disagreeing...but you have to look at the candidates too. In 2020 the candidate was Quinn Nystrom.

The DCCC didn't back her and neither did many other folks...even local democrat/DFL leaders didn't show up for. In contrast Schultz is a state legislator with a record of fundraising well, working hard, and winning. She already knows almost every key DFL stakeholder at the state level and locally.

"I wish her luck but the red cancer has got hold on the Iron Range pretty bad. I really don't think she has much of a chance and the DFL should have known this. 

You'd need a populist to bring miners back into the fold and that means guns and a compromise on mining. We liberals don't like to hear that, but that is the reality and key to cutting out the cancer. 

The DFL must get back to labor and farmer roots. The social issues (though important) won't return Rangers to blue. Let me say that again. The social issues (though important) won't return Rangers to blue. 

They might tolerate forward progress on social issues if social reformers actually put equal effort into unions, fair wages and farming issues. You don't have to be a farmer to appreciate rural issues. It's been neglected for 30 years and Fox filled that void.

It was also more expensive than Bigelow, which is actually really good with the real bergamot oil and all.

Actually now that I think of it I’m SURE I’ve seen bulk tea at the Whole Foods co-op. Give that a look. Probably the best product turnover there thus freshest.

"What the fuck are you talking about? The three examples I gave were: standing in the way (not terrorism, but civil disobedience), locking oneself to equipment (also not terrorism) and ""throwing a whistle into a pipe"" (which alludes to the fact that police attempted to characterize a plastic whistle in a package as a possibly dangerous device), which is also not terrorism. So.... please explain how these examples are ""clearly terrorism."" They are not sabotage (which is vandalism and worse) nor are they damage of any kind.

Deliberately calling non-violent action ""sabotage"" is a blatant lie and you know it. Sabotage by definition involves physical damage to property, not just standing my ass in the way of your actions. Also, when Enbridge hires police to do their bidding, which they did,  that means the boundaries are obviously all kinds of mixed up.

Just facts, indeed. How many millions of dollars of physical sabotage were done compared to Enbridge's damage to our environment again?

"I think in Duluth it also really depends on what type of house you're looking to buy in addition to the macro level market. Duluth's got a lot of older, smaller houses on small lots. I personally know 6 friends (7 including myself) who bought houses in Duluth in the last year with relatively little trouble (relative to our current crazy housing market that is)-- didn't have to go ridiculously over the asking price or waiving inspection, etc. These were all 2 or 3 bedroom houses in relatively older, denser areas (East Hillside, Piedmont, Lincoln Park, Gary New Duluth etc), some of which required a little bit of work to make look nicer. If you're open to this sort of house, it's what Duluth has the most of and it anecdotally it seems like people are navigating that market ok. Still not a ton listed right now and might pay a little more than normally, but doable.

If you're looking for a larger home, multiple bathrooms, larger yard, newer house, ""nicer"" part of town, Duluth just doesn't have as many of those homes to start with and it's always going to be more competitive and it's only being exacerbated by the current market.

"Negative I didn’t misread. The examples you described ARE clearly ecoterrorism, per [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ecoterrorism). Ain’t my definition, that’s just facts. 

Definition of ecoterrorism
1 : sabotage intended to hinder activities that are considered damaging to the environment
2 : political terrorism intended to damage an enemy's natural environment

Civil disobedience is just the wrong term for the examples you listed bc that relates to governments, not private companies.

"I have a love-hate with this city. Born and raised, though moved to Phoenix and absolutely loved it there (""coldest to warmest"") it changed my perception and standards for a city. Unfortunately, after 1.5 years I moved back due to a family member I lived with fell into drug abuse. I often wonder how much better off I'd be if I hadn't decided to move back. I was happier there for many reasons. People were nicer to me there, it felt more chipper and buzzing with happenings, the warmth and sunlight dissolved my 'SAD' (Seasonal Affective Disorder), many things more to do on any given day, and the economy was booming compared to the historic stagnation of Duluth - it was a natural fit. I do regret moving back, yes. I want to move to a more opportunity-rich warmer, sunnier city, yes. But I will always have a sentimentality to the Duluth area, even though there is a lot about it to be cynical about when one takes off the rose-colored glasses.

As for the people, I find the polar experience is the right word for it: some are cavity-inducing sweet and nice, while others are as cold and mean as the winters. For me, I tend to remember the more negative personalities - probably because many of the nice people have that Scandinavian '*keep to themselves*' mentality and A-holes tend to push their bad energy more easily.

**Let's put it this way:** if I won a large lottery jackpot, I would move asap, but would retain a house and cabin (on a lake) in the Duluth area always.

"The connection to the city is an important aspect, like do we want this guy in our employ?  Should we hold city employees to a higher standard than a private firm might?


I think it would depend on his role.   If he is customer facing like a first responder or an inspector, then no.    If his job is to knock down physical barriers like a burning wall with whatever he has in hand, then it's probably ok.  This level of reasoning is likely not allowed as it requires a judgement that might not be applied fairly.

I would bet the city is rightly reserving judgement until there is an official judgement made by the court.  If he's convicted, I do not know that he can or would be fired.  I would hope he's being closely supervised for any sort of breach that would give an excuse.   

The better part of valor for him would be to get out of town.  I would hope that he's considering it, and I'd bet the existence of a leash law is in his consideration of where he might go.  There is a certain freedom and lower level of anxiety in place with no leash laws.   He could rightly blame his troubles on the leash law.      I only choose to live under leash laws to accommodate those close to me.  As a pariah, that equation may change for him.  

When I said homosexual, I meant the two people involved in the incident, like a man attacking a man, or a woman attacking a woman.  Without the imbalance, it'd be less reportable.     Homogendered would be a better word, but I don't know that ""homogendered"" has entered the lexicon yet.

"It seems very common and normal for people to advocate for people they identify with.  It does not seem weird to me at all to advocate for my identity, but I do recognize that it is dangerous for me to advocate for my particular identity.  Taking that risk is weird.  

Yes, guys will get confrontational in these situations, but it comes to chest bumping before it comes to cell phones.  It is settled there and then as per the rules both understand and operate under.  

Maybe this guy would have gone to far in that situation too, he was obviously not entirely in control of himself.  But, if it was homosexual  I doubt it'd been posted here so many times, or the paper would have had at least two follow up articles on it.  When it is homosexual, it's either not reported to the police at all, or if it is it's not reported in the paper.  Still, I've managed to avoid it, by just recognizing that it's not good to escalate to a physical level.  

Safety IMHO comes at too great a cost. To guard against the rare occurrence, we live in fear and anxiety with rules that may or may not keep us safe.  It might be better to just know how to handle oneself without having rules that might not be beneficial in all situations.  The rules themselves carry a psychological toll.

"I've sought help, it doesn't.   Some things you can't unlearn, like the futility of life.

What you're saying, is that I'm mentally ill, because I'm not cheering on your one sided view.  Mental illness is subjective.  There's no objective test for it.    

There is a value in mental illness though, a society needs the outliers to question reality, and challenge what is normal.   You can't expand the circle of human knowledge until you know where the edges are.

Even reality itself, is entirely subjective.  This is increasingly proven as the world shapes itself into two entirely different realities, FM radio vs. AM radio,  NPR vs. Rush Limbaugh.   

For you, I'd say don't dismiss someone just because you think they may be ill   On occasion you'll find truth in the rants of a lunatic.    You also don't want to dismiss someone because you don't agree with what they are saying, lest you find yourself stuck on one radio band and ,miss the larger truth.

She wasn't trying to take a picture of the dogs because she thought they were cute, she was trying to threaten him with the legal system.  She wasn't so threatened by his breach of the sacred leash law that she couldn't pull out her phone.     Since threatening legal action not an immediate physical threat, yeah, he was wrong to resort to violence.  

Unless she actually did have mace on her, which would put a reasonable doubt in my mind.  

It's victim blaming, but I do think Karen did escalate the situation and is not entirely blameless.   

Thinking there was a weapon works pretty good for Minneapolis cops to get away with murder, except Karen here was white, so it might not work, like with that Aussie woman they killed a while back where the cop got sent away for it.",t2_3s9b4,gsasquatch,0,1647960659.0,0,t1_i1o17pq,i1o17pq,True,SpookyBlackCat,t3_tk3cns,https://www.reddit.com/r/duluth/comments/tk3cns/duluth_firefighter_to_stand_trial_for_attacking/,Duluth firefighter to stand trial for attacking elderly woman,/r/duluth/comments/tk3cns/duluth_firefighter_to_stand_trial_for_attacking/i1o17pq/,-62,r/duluth,0,-62

"We still went $35k over asking. Looking back over our 8 month search, just about every house I would consider ""good"" went from $15-40k over. I would consider $30k over asking the safe amount to get your house, but more if there are a lot of bidders actually.  
We went with a pass/fail inspection. So while technically non-contingent on inspection what I was told is that if the inspector found major issues we could walk away. We may be out our earnest money at that point, but because it was pass/fail it would have likely been something that shouldve been disclosed and so we were likely to get back earnest money after a back and forth.  
Certainly not ideal, but from what we've been hearing the majority of accepted offers are going with no inspections.

"While there could be a number of reasons your plants arent taking to growing, I would guess the sandy soil could be one of the main contributors. 

Water will drain through sand much faster than topsoil or regular dirt so when you go to replant you want to ""amend"" your soil.  This means digging 1.5-2x deeper, and wider than the pot your plant comes in, and adding a nice topsoil/compost blend to the sandy soil that you remove. You don't want to totally remove the original soil, but more blend the topsoil into the sand so the roots are encouraged to grow past the new topsoil into the native ground.  The topsoil will hold on to water a bit longer than just sand, and give the plants a chance to drink.

We lost two houses (that we put at least 10k over on) and looked at 30+ houses in total before we lucked out and paid sticker for the our current home.

We almost gave up several times, but ultimately stuck to it. We had a great realtor (shout out to Brenna Fahlin of Messina) who did a great job of keeping us on track.

"I live in Lakeside about half of a block off of the tracks, the access to the Lakewalk more than makes up for the trains. I think the only crossings they blow their whistle for are HWY 61 and the one near Sammy's. The trains move at less than 20 mph and are short, so they're pretty quiet and don't really get in the way too much. I can barely hear them from my house, but the rhythm is nice.

The advantage to it not being a commercial rail line is that it only runs during the day. It goes off of a tourist schedule, so late starts and done by about 8. They do run 7 days a week in the summer and they probably come through 5-10 times (all of their trips are out and back).
