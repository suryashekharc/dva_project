"If I’m cornered and someone’s advancing on me, I have two options.

1. Assume they just want to talk to me.
2. Assume they may intend to harm me.

Most sane, well-adjusted people don’t advance in a threatening manner on someone who’s in a car. A car is both armor and a deadly weapon, so if someone is confronting me in my car (or with theirs), there’s already at least one deadly weapon in the picture and they’ve shown an intent to engage.

It takes less than a second for someone to pull a gun and start shooting. Likewise, in the time it takes an average trained individual to draw a handgun, someone with a knife in their hand can cover about ~20 feet and attack. If I don’t draw my handgun until that person is within 20 feet, I’m fucked if they want to hurt me.

Again, aggression involving a car means a deadly weapon is already involved. Most people don’t think about that, and they should. Cars are really fucking dangerous and reckless behavior with them kills something like 40,000 Americans every year, almost all of which are negligent deaths. There are less than a thousand negligent firearms deaths every year, so it’s not even a close comparison.

My firearm, like a fire extinguisher, is something I really hope I never need, and my first option is always gonna be to either GTFO or de-escalate. If that doesn’t work, I’m going to try the other route (GTFO or de-escalate, whichever I didn’t do first).

Say I’m at a restaurant and some drunk guy picks a fight with me. I’m gonna try to talk to him, redirect him, maybe buy him a drink or get a bouncer involved, whatever I can do to calm him down. If he keeps it up, I’ll leave. If he attacks me, I’ll escalate from there.

If I’m in a car and someone threatens me, I’ll just drive away. But if I’m cornered in a parking lot, I have two options:
1. De-escalate with someone who’s already proven willing to engage in a situation with deadly weapons involved that they know about (cars). Pretty risky.
2. Escalate force. Obviously some guy standing outside his car ranting doesn’t justify this, because I’m not in real danger yet, so I’ll ignore him, lock my car, maybe call the cops. But if he advances on my car, we’ve established:

1. Hostile intent
2. Involvement of a lethal weapon
3. No way to retreat

That’s when I’ll think about using a firearm. Maybe I still have other options. If I do, I should use those first. If I don’t, if I’m all out of choices and this theoretical dude seems like he really wants to cause me problems - again, in a situation where lethal weapons are already involved, and I’m trapped - I’ll draw and start yelling at him to get on the ground. If he’s still froggy at this point, is within knife range (20-30 feet), advancing on me, and I’m *all out of options*, I feel perfectly justified in shooting him.

Don’t want to get shot? Don’t put people in situations where they may reasonably fear you intend to grievously harm or kill them. It really is that simple. Be a good human and others will probably treat you the same way. Be a homicidal one and others will probably treat you the same way.",t2_uob0u,abn1304,0,1649012818.0,0,t1_i399nbm,i399nbm,False,kayl_breinhar,t3_tv4oth,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/tv4oth/you_know_how_when_youre_driving_late_at_night_you/,"You know how, when you're driving late at night, you always wonder if you're being followed?",/r/nova/comments/tv4oth/you_know_how_when_youre_driving_late_at_night_you/i399nbm/,1,r/nova,0,1

"Long story short. You can get qualified for more than you think and probably could even use comfortably. But you can qualify and there are still houses that you can afford (although they are town homes, condos, or trailers in the suburbs probably).

Story: We were making under 70k cumulative and were approved for a mortgage of a bit over 500k at 4.2% for 30 years (it was a few years ago).

The only time a gun is mentioned or thought of is if they decided to open my door, which does happen because road ragers tend to have 0 self control.

"This always seems to come up in these types of threads about Loudoun being ""too far"", or ""boring"". I don't think most of us who actually live here, feel that way. I can tell you for fact that it can take longer to get to DC from some parts of Fairfax county than Ashburn. The roads absolutely suck around the most central parts of Fairfax, so it can easily take a half an hour to go a few miles. Span hour commute could be 10 miles or 50 around here, depending on what you have to drive through.

As to stuff to do, that's all relative. If you're a single twenty something, and want to hang out at bars with other single twenty something's, than sure move to Arlington. But if you're a normal person who just wants to go out every now and then, there's plenty of places nearby to do so. If you like the outdoors, you're much closer to those kinds of things here than closer to the city. 

I couldn't tell you where you should live without knowing what you're looking for, but I can say not to rule places out just buy people's opinions. Anywhere in the DMV can be great, or horrible based on a number of factors.

"Rent and utilities for 2000 in Fairfax county that you want to be safe or clean...good luck, I'd suggest looking into Eastern Loudoun county (Ashburn, Leesburg Sterling) or Prince William county (Gainesville has an great shopping center and housing in that area is in your budget)

PW county has public transportation but it s u c k s it does have the VRE, which is reliable and not too expensive for commuting. Driving from Gainesville to D.C would kind of suck, depending on when you leave.

"I was followed once.  I have a habit of never going into my neighborhood area if there's a car behind me.  If there is, I go down a different street away from my house and slowly circle back once no one is behind me.

One time I did this and a car remained behind me after a few turns. At this point I was pretty far into the back of the neighborhood so I started to slowly make my way to the back entrance. So at this point I was actually backtracking. They were still behind me so I knew for sure I was being followed. When I exited the neighborhood out the back entrance they figured out I was on to them and went a different way.  

At this point there was no way I was going to park out in front of my house in case they decided to circle back to look for it, so I drove to a nearby shopping center, parked my car there for the night, and walked home while looking for any cars around that could see me.

Never found out why they were following me, thankfully. I mean if they were intent on tracking me down they could have cased the neighborhood a few nights later looking for me.

"First thought are potential carjackers? Seems to be a trend in the DMV but tbh I’ve only heard of it lately in DC.

The Maserati could have been a rental (likely out of Florida) which can make it harder to track. DC, VA, MD are all 2 plate states, unless they refused/hid the front plate… but that would attract too much heat, especially in VA. Since there were 2 guys, maybe one was gonna carjack and the other would speed off. 

Other thought was that maybe they were casing you to burglarize your place? This kind of happened to my dad once. They were learning his habits of when he left his house and broke in when he was “scheduled” to be gone the longest.

"Years ago - before cell phones were common - I returned from a business trip at 12:30 a.m. As I drove home from the airport, I decided to stop at an ATM for some money. There were no drive-through ATMs then, so I had to park curbside on a fairly isolated street and walk up to the bank. 

When I pulled up to the curb and parked, another car immediately pulled up and parked behind me. Now it’s about 1:00 a.m., what are the odds that we both were going to the ATM at that hour? So I decided to leave, and return when it was daylight. The other car pulled out about ten seconds after I did, and went its separate way. No one had ever gotten out of their car.

"I lived at The Park at Arlington Ridge by Army Navy Dr and had a pleasant experience. Garden style means more space and no elevator. The inside was fairly new. The unit had a gas range, washer and dryer inside the unit, decent closet space, etc. They also provide a shuttle to Pentagon City, etc. Close to DC. I moved because of the noise issue from the unit above me - thin ceiling. If you live at the top floor, you should be fine. The neighborhood was safe. Neighbors were friendly. Close to Giant and Starbucks. The cost might be higher than $2K. Other areas in Arlington are way higher than $2K.

You can also rent a condo from a landlord. Try hotpads.com and enter 22302 as the zip code. Just a few mins from The Park. Still close to Arlington and DC. Look for one along Martha Custis Dr. Here’s an example: https://hotpads.com/3525-martha-custis-dr-alexandria-va-22302-snr3p5/pad?laundry=inUnit&propertyTypes=condo.

I've been followed a time or three in my life (I'm An Old™ of 51 years).  The four right turns is definite verification.

The last time this happened (out in Reston) was startling because, as I stated, I'm An Old and someone following me seemed out of character.  I also have a fast ass car and they were driving a junker, so after the Four Turn Validation Trick, I opened it up on 28 and got away easily, which I freely admit is ***not*** easy if you don't have a muscle car and the willingness to get popped by the police.

That's kinda what the road side emissions test does. If you drive around enough without a catalytic converter they send you a letter to go get emissions tested again. If they fail to do it the fines are pretty steep. Could you have a loud exhaust that passes roadside test yes but  if you go as far as disabling or removing the cat they will catch them that way. They could also add it to the safety inspection pretty easily and some inspectors do look for modified cat back exhaust and will fail them for VA safety inspection but it has to be over the top straight pipe obnoxious. VA could add a DB meter to the safety inspection but I guess it would have to be an aftermarket or modified exhaust and fail whatever noise level is deemed a failure.,t2_a4blmcod,Substantial_Job3331,0,1648990621.0,0,t1_i37vcph,i37vcph,False,sharkowictz,t3_tuhvdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/tuhvdd/fart_can_exhaust_noise_enforcement_bill_across_va/,Fart can exhaust noise enforcement bill across VA pending,/r/nova/comments/tuhvdd/fart_can_exhaust_noise_enforcement_bill_across_va/i37vcph/,1,r/nova,0,1

My hope is that an FCPD cop reads this thread, sees the route I took, the time stamps in the images and video, and is able to get a rear plate on these pricks, because they didn't have a front one.

"Speeding up would've endangered me and made \*me\* break the law.  For all I know, they had a dashcam as well and their idea of fun is getting people they chase to run and get into accidents.  Maybe they're carjackers.  All I know is they certainly didn't have my good health and wellbeing in mind.  They were obviously getting *something* out of following me - I wasn't about to make it *fun* for them.

If I'd gunned it to get away from them (again, 175hp H4 Subaru vs. 345-580hp V6 or V8), I'd have shown fear and it might've escalated the situation.  For all I knew, that's exactly what they wanted.

">So, by your standard, if your hobby impacts my life through annoyance, it should be banned?

Not surprisingly, you misread the comment: ""annoying other people by impacting their lives"". The order is important. It's not the annoyance that is the key, but the impact.

Your rights to do what you wish do have a defined context and limitations. Let's take those cyclists you mentioned as an example. You find them annoying. Okay. That's fine for you. Do they impact your life? Maybe you feel that they do, but they are actually exercising their rights in a way that is supported by city/county/state laws. They've been granted that space to do that activity. Your desire to impact that puts *you* in the wrong. They are legally protected in that context.

For children its a little different. Children's right to be in public is viewed as a basic human right and your desire to restrict that sort of puts you down in the dregs of humanity. You're free to be annoyed by it. You may even find your life being negatively impacted by them, but their rights to be in public are equal to yours.  And that's only partly a legal thing, and partly just a ""be a somewhat respectable human"" thing.

Now, let's compare that to the children who are enamored of making their cars loud. They are granted a right to drive a car on the street. That car is allowed some level of reasonable customization. However, when that customization serves the sole/primary purpose to simply emit noise that travels far outside the area they were granted the rights, there can be a problem. If I can hear that someone is driving down the street or revving their engine 100m away, through two lines of trees and the walls of my house... then they've passed what would be a reasonable expression of their hobby and are now impacting people's lives.

But how else are they supposed to let everyone know how cool they are?

I know, the world is a difficult place. However, they're much more likely to find people who are receptive to such displays in areas that are actually designated for it. There are tracks. Events. Meetups. It's not only more accepted, but actually (in most cases) legally allowed for such hobbies to exist in those places.

So, I realize that there are a lot of words here, and you happily misquoted and equivocated above, so this is probably just making things worse. The issue isn't the hobby. And it's not criminalizing anything that someone finds annoying. The issue is taking actions that negatively impact other people's lives in places where they had a reasonable (legal) expectation to avoid that.

It's legal to ride a bicycle in a bike lane. It's nuisance for you to ride a bike through my yard. It's legal to drive down the street in a high performance car. It's acceptable for that car to be noisy to someone on the sidewalk. It's a nuisance if that car sends noise into the homes of people living a couple blocks away.",t2_gs0o3,malastare-,0,1648962317.0,0,t1_i36tr38,i36tr38,False,sharkowictz,t3_tuhvdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/tuhvdd/fart_can_exhaust_noise_enforcement_bill_across_va/,Fart can exhaust noise enforcement bill across VA pending,/r/nova/comments/tuhvdd/fart_can_exhaust_noise_enforcement_bill_across_va/i36tr38/,2,r/nova,0,2

I wore her a lot but I also had back problems (herniated disc) after the pregnancy/birth so my husband wore her as much as possible. I could not believe the amount of comments we got about a man (!!!!) wearing the baby.

There is also an unusually large Starbucks on Leesburg Pike, next to TJ Max/711, etc.

Or, if you'd like, can meet at Hearth in the Tysons Hilton, or in the front/bar area of that Hilton, has a nice little bar and décor per se, and free parking supposedly.

Also can park near the Hyatt in Tysons, and go up the stairs/escalator to front desk area, there is a little sort of faux rustic esque restaurant there, probably has free Wifi, also has a cool-ish, or semi-trendy I should say, outdoor seating area in a big sort of open like cement-quad type thing, in front of entrance to Hyatt that is upstairs, I see folks with their families there sometimes, it is also next to the mall, this outdoor area, and also next to Metro, or causeway/walkway to Tysons-Mall Metro station.

There are a lot of places you could go if just looking for Wi-Fi, etc.

Of those mentioned, I think the front-area of Tysons Hilton is probably the nicest.  It is a kind of cool little spot I think.
