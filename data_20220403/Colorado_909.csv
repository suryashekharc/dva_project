"My friends brought me camping for my birthday in Sylvan Lake state park a few years ago, and the ride out after through the aspens with the afternoon sun on them was something magical I'll probably never forget. I'm not a 'native' (I'm from Massachusetts, hello I miss your state) so that was something special. We have a lot of deciduous forests here, with coniferous trees scattered around - rarely are there patches of pine trees in crazy quantities unless you head to western mass, or up to NH. Growing up in NH's mountains, I was awed by Colorado's ranges and forests. I'm not from there, but.. after living there for 5 or so years (and dreaming about it as a kid for this very reason) being there in the thick of it was something else.

I miss your state practically every day. Planned on returning, but I found a job I love so... I'm staying put for now. Maybe someday, if I can convince the boy. I don't think he'll be disappointed.

"Yes, it’s a violation of bodily autonomy. If you had magic blood that could cure a particular person’s blood disorder, there is nothing that particular person could do to force or compel you to provide them your blood against your will. Because you have bodily autonomy, you control that decision, and it’s seen as wrong to infringe on this natural right.

So the same logic applies to a a fetus and a pregnant person. You cannot be compelled to give your blood to sustain a fetus again your will. This is why abortions are generally banned(in the us) once they baby is viable to exist outside the woman, baring some unforeseen circumstances. If you don’t wanna sustain it, give birth to it and it’ll exist in the NICU.

You even have bodily autonomy when you’re dead! If you don’t want to give your organs after you die, no one can force you to give them up.

Just to be clear, the GOP want women to have less bodily autonomy than we grant to dead people.",t2_aq6bs,hippyengineer,0,1648940013.0,0,t1_i35tq94,i35tq94,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tuh28o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tuh28o/gop_congressional_candidate_believes_abortion_is/,GOP Congressional Candidate Believes 'Abortion Is A Human Sacrifice' To Demons,/r/Colorado/comments/tuh28o/gop_congressional_candidate_believes_abortion_is/i35tq94/,5,r/Colorado,0,5

"You're ignoring one's perspective of the other side.

For example, how does an atheist view Christian worship?  Well, because they don't think any deity exists at all then all the Christians are doing is singing and talking, with nobody listening at the other end.

On the other hand, to a religious person God actually exists.  How might they view an atheist's actions?  (Well, some of them, since there's a wide variety of beliefs out there.)  To not believe in anything is to deny the truth.  To do (in their view) an evil action is to act against God.

"As a European living in Denver, I agree and disagree with you. Yes recycling in Europe doesn’t work perfectly, but it is much better than here and one important difference is, they are working on improving it.

First of all, Europeans produce  [less waste](https://www.statista.com/statistics/689809/per-capital-msw-generation-by-country-worldwide/) than Americans.

Then the laws are not only focused on recycling. The German law (Kreislaufwirtschaftsgesetz) which is based on EU regulation 2018/851/EU for example prioritizes avoidance over recycling. As a second step it improves recycling. The packaging industry has to fulfill certain recycling quotas. That is, why you will find more plastic made out of recycled material in Europe than the US. You also have companies like Quantafuel, who are working on newer technologies, which break recycleates down into chemical components which work as raw material for the chemical industry

"Yes, I read the whole article. It starts with an outright falsehood - that what we aren't recycling is worth $100 million, when it most certainly is not - and goes from there. It's dishonest piece making a whole series of wishful arguments, some mutually contradictory.

Some of the arguments are not terrible, in and of themselves. I have been persuaded, from earlier talks with Redditors, that - for example - making industry pay the up-front cost of recycling could have benefits even though it will still be consumers paying for it in the end.  

But it doesn't matter who is paying for it if the system is fundamentally broken and does not work. When it comes to consumer plastic recycling, the system is fundamentally broken. Making companies pay to put everyone's garbage into a wasteful, environment-damaging program, does not make the program become unwasteful and un-environment-damaging.

"Plastics recycling in Europe is a shitshow.

To the degree that it isn't, it's because they \*aren't recycling consumer plastic\* but instead long ago switched focus to industrial recycling (where they can take steps to avoid the massive cross-contamination that makes it a joke on the consumer level).

I'm not opposed to making improvements to recycling. Some of the European ideas there are very good. (I like the German Green Dot system, where manufacturers pay recycling taxes in proportion to the level of packaging on a given product line - cut down on packaging, pay less.)

I am opposed to wishfully hoping that if you make a shitty system mandatory, that will make the system get better. Long experience shows that exactly the opposite is true: once everyone HAS to do something, the people in charge of the something no longer have to even pretend to make things workable. They can just collect their monthly recycling charges and continue to make things worse by burning extra fuel to move garbage from a landfill, to a place where it will be pretend-sorted and pretend-recycled, and then moved to another landfill.

Metal: great to recycle. People do it on their own. It pays.

Paper and glass: iffy but not dreadful, as conditions make it make sense. Sometimes it's less damaging to just make new glass.

Plastics: works only if you have tight control over a materials stream. Fine as an internal industrial tool.

"So what we put in landfills could be sold for $100 million each year, yet no private enterprise sees that and says ""score, easy money!"" and collects the goods. Why? 

(Because it would cost more than $100 million to collect it and pack it off to sell it - assuming that there would be an actual, versus hypothetical, market for it, which there is not.)

Recycling is a band-aid that was promoted by the plastic industry to assuage people's fears about a disposable lifestyle. It's OK that everything is plastic, we reason, it all goes to be recycled! Gaia! Green Earth!

Except no. For the most part, recycled stuff goes into the landfill, only with an extra step and extra expenses and extra fuel cost contributing to extra environmental damage. 

Certain kinds of recycling work very well - metals, for example. It's PROFITABLE to recycle metal; metal is forever. Glass less so, but it's easy to work with; but glass is made of sand and garbage. Making new glass is no more of a burden on the planet than shipping the old glass around to remelt it. Plastic recycling is a disaster, always has been, always will be.

Mandating that everyone be forced to participate in this environmental theater doesn't make it better.

"My concern is the environmental impact. If 30,000 people are going to be in the wilderness, there needs to be a plan to manage human waste. A person produces about 14 oz of poop a day, and 30,000 people camp for a week, that’s around 22,000 gallons of poop. I just don’t see that much volume being properly managed without good organization and management. The Rainbow folks claim they will just bury it. 

Another way to look at it… that’s about the same volume as three 20 ft school buses. So they would needs to bury a school bus-sized volume of poop about every 2-ish days. That just feels like a lot of poop to manage responsibility. Serious question, what is the plan for human waste? Is there a valid argument that a minimum of 3 school buses worth of feces won’t have an impact on that environment? 

Arid, high-elevation, lodgepole pine climates are not effective at composting.  So burying over 22,000 gallons of feces is not an environmentally sound option. It will take years and years to degrade.

It’s just wild to me that people who claim to love mother nature so much are so ignorant about it.

">But deputy Forest Supervisor Ryan Nehl said that repair work is more about the visible impact. “There are going to be subsurface and water impacts that are hard to see,” he said. “We won’t know the full effect of this gathering for years.”

https://www.opb.org/news/article/oregon-rainbow-gathering-bliss-forest-service-headache/

>The loosely organized group’s website says they support “community-building, non-violence and alternative lifestyles.” But, Nehl says not all at the event lived up to that description. ""Not every one of them is peaceful, peace loving. There is a lot of antagonism in the group, from the way they treat Forest Service personnel, specifically law enforcement officers. They were outright rude and harassing law enforcement during the event. As far as the trash, there is quite a bit of trash generated at the event; there are loose dogs still running around.""

>Nehl tells KBND News, ""Damage that they’re doing in that small of a space; it really has a big impact. I’ve seen it from the air. From a helicopter you can see bare dirt in a lot of areas that were nice green meadows. They’ve worn paths through there. Just the amount of human waste on the site is a concern to us, and certainly the potential for groundwater contamination is of grave concern."" Now, with just a few hundred people left, the clean-up effort is underway. ""What we developed were criteria for rehabilitation and repairing the site to its original condition. Some volunteers from Rainbow Family started that, but they haven’t been very successful with achieving the guidelines for repair and rehabilitation.""

"In my town, a garbage company originally had 3 bags of trash and 10 gallons of common recycles (cans, paper) for $30/mo. About 4 years ago,  they decided to start charging for recycling saying it would be an additional $15 a month per bag of common recycles. Needless to say, I've seen a lot less recycling bins during trash days since. And places like then mentioned Blue Star charge you for recycling certain items, namely electronics.

People want to recycle out here I believe,  just few want to pay extra for it, or transport it themselves and as the  article says,  recycling locations arent necessarily convenient.

"Wow her website is completely useless for voters, unless you’re looking to buy an “Armor of God” endorsement T-shirt featuring a passage from chapter 6 of Ephesians, where Paul uses a metaphor of Roman armor to detail the tools available to Christians (which are truth, righteousness, the gospel, faith, salvation, the word of the Christian god, and prayer) to stand against the devil’s schemes and survive his attacks. The chapter also stresses the importance of obedience, specifically to children of their fathers, as well as directing ‘servants’ to serve with good intention as if they were working for Christ, and that their Masters are warned not to be too harsh for fear of their final judgement.

The only platform she has posted on her website is “The Right To Choose” (which she does not specifically mention abortion, just that she’s “a huge supporter of medical freedoms”), but does manage to be particularly-verbose when talking about herself including how she has zero experience and “a winning strategy to put common sense back into legislation” (but also neglects to mention how or what she plans to do if elected).

If you manage to get through all of the printed word on her website and watch her official campaign video, the polarizing images depicted in it can pretty much guide your vote (with a clip from a MAGA rally and an image of a woman removing her surgical mask with Danielle saying “mark today in your calendar that you defended the constitution” over it).",t2_3ul4woag,brewgiehowser,0,1648824874.0,0,t1_i2znlkz,i2znlkz,True,danikawo,t3_tt2fh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tt2fh0/a_republican_candidate_for_colorado_governor_was/,"A Republican candidate for Colorado governor was arrested three times, is subject of restraining order",/r/Colorado/comments/tt2fh0/a_republican_candidate_for_colorado_governor_was/i2znlkz/,1,r/Colorado,0,1

"You're stuck on January 6th and this is my last reply.

It is and always should be a ""both sides"" argument. Without looking at both sides of a situation you cannot create equality. It's that simple. In the early 1900s black Americans were treated much worse under the law than white Americans. If it weren't for looking at both sides the inequities would not have been brought to light. It is mandatory to look at all sides of an equation to come to a solution.

You'll note that at no point did I say the law wasn't needed or that it shouldn't have been signed. What I did say is that it doesn't go far enough. It shouldn't only be about people standing at ballot boxes with guns but also about people calling for violence in any form if their ""side"" doesn't win. Both are equally bad.

Instead you are choosing to ignore the statement that both situations are reprehensible, so I can only assume you're ok with someone coming into your community and destroying your property, burning down your home, violencing your person because their guy didn't win/they didn't get the verdict they wanted/whatever didn't go their desired way even if you were not against that outcome. 

I'm not ok with that. I'm not ok with people standing next to a ballot box or outside a polling place with guns and I agree they should be arrested and charged with voter intimidation. I also think those rallying for riots based on the outcome of an election should also be charged with voter intimidation. My opinion is not Republican nor is it Democrat. We can't have a free and equal society when people are not treated equally under the law and let's face it, the people holding the guns are likely conservatives while those calling for riots are likely liberal. Neither one are innocent and both should be addressed, but they aren't and here we are.

"I guess I missed all of the news reporting of threats  leading up to the January 6 sedition.

Couple of points here...
1. You assume I agreed with or supported January 6th and Donald Trump. You are wrong on both counts.

2. I'm merely pointing out that there have been activities done by individuals all over the political spectrum in an attempt to coerce voters. This is NOT a conservative vs liberal thing. It's NOT left vs right. It should all be treated the same way. Equal protection under the law should mean just that irrespective of skin color, sexual orientation, gender identity, and POLITICAL AFFILIATION. 

Unfortunaty what we're seeing more and more in this country is that whichever political party is in power starts legislating laws that favor their party members. Does this mean that Gov Polis shouldn't have signed this law, absolutely not. In my opinion this law doesn't go far enough. It shouldn't be only about people open carrying guns outside a polling place, but also people who threaten destruction if their desired outcome doesn't come to fruition.

People open carrying firearms outside a polling place are fucking dumb, just like people who hold rallies and make threats to riot and burn if they don't get their way are dumb. Both are coercing whatever situation to end in their desired outcome and both groups should be treated the same under the law, unfortunately one group was addressed by this legislation and the other was ignored.",t2_7hjm2ngu,Competitive-Rate-703,0,1648816744.0,0,t1_i2z5dd1,i2z5dd1,False,coskibum002,t3_tt1pap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tt1pap/vote_without_fear_act_signed_into_law_by_governor/,Vote Without Fear Act signed into law by Governor Polis,/r/Colorado/comments/tt1pap/vote_without_fear_act_signed_into_law_by_governor/i2z5dd1/,-4,r/Colorado,0,-4

"Fan-fucking-tastic

My parents own a cabin that was broken into during their 2017 visit to the state, can't actually prove anyone involved in the gathering was responsible because no one was ever arrested for it but it happened during their visit. They inherited the cabin from my great grandfather who had lived their when they he was younger but who hadn't been there in over two decades due to health issues, the cabin was in a very bad state when we got it but we had put a lot of effort into fixing it back up, just them, my siblings, me and a little bit of help from other relatives and it was basically livable again, no electricity, running water, or other modern convenience but amazing for weekend getaways. Then someone came, broke out windows, spray painted the walls, smashed alcohol bottles all over the place, destroyed the handmade desk my great grandfather had built, kicked in doors that didn't even fucking lock, pissed on our floors, and stole literally everything they could carry: old family scrapbooks, my grandma's records from when she was in High School, the grill, our board games. It was devastating to see years of our hard work restoring it go down the toilet in-between weekend visits, it's the only time I've ever seen my father cry.

And we got back to work and despite various issues diverting my parents attention elsewhere it's in even better condition now than before they came in 2017 just in time for them to come and wreck all our hard work all over again. Yay. Guess I'm gonna request late June-early July off from work and spend a couple weeks hanging out up there to deter trouble makers, not really what I wanted to use my vacation time for but it's better than having it destroyed again.",t2_gidx06ov,fhangnshnaidb661774,0,1648706526.0,0,t1_i2tdq68,i2tdq68,True,HelpfulForestTroll,t3_tsd42z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Colorado/comments/tsd42z/up_to_30000_people_may_camp_on_co_nfs_land_for/,"Up to 30,000 people may camp on CO NFS land for 2022 Rainbow Gathering.",/r/Colorado/comments/tsd42z/up_to_30000_people_may_camp_on_co_nfs_land_for/i2tdq68/,19,r/Colorado,0,19
