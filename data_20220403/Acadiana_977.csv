"From NPR: 

Critics of the bill argue the cap alone doesn't do enough to solve the underlying problem of rising prescription drug prices.  
  
""We want lower prices for drugs, particularly for insulin,"" said Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., during debate. ""But instead of fixing a broken system, this bill aims to control it,"" he adding, calling the bill a ""socialist plan.""

Yeah, so let 100,000 Americans die of diabetes instead of putting caps on commonly used medications.

"Fear-monger Lunsford is playing off the fears of many who do not attend anything downtown because ‚Äúof the violence.‚Äù I suspect that that anxiety and misunderstanding about downtown comes from the shooting in 2017. The newspaper accounts that I find juxtapose the murder with phrases that connect the shooting around midnight to the Festival. For example, ‚ÄúThe shooting occurred after Festival International activities‚Äù (this quotation is from *The Advocat*e) Whenever I mention how much time I spend downtown, some of my acquaintances usually mention ‚Äúthe violence;‚Äù when I ask for details, I get ‚Äúthat murder ***during*** Festival.‚Äù

Lunsford‚Äôs group want to scare his ‚Äúreaders‚Äù into avoiding downtown because of the violence (and I will respect y‚Äôall to make your own conclusions about the implications of that.) That way they vote against the interests of downtown and in turn hurt the revenues that come from our events that benefit the entire parish, especially where I presume many of Lunsford‚Äôs readers live.

To attack Begnaud who has nothing to do with setting the date of elections and the festival indicates how Lunsford uses misdirection to appeal to his readers‚Äô basic fears‚Äîall to serve his sponsors who want to cut funding for the arts and cultural events to cut their personal taxes.¬†

"It's very clear while fairly applied, the law is not fairly written.

There should exist a level of licensure with appropriate training that covers sanitation, pathogenic safety, and other general concerns without placing excessive barriers to entry. Yes, I do believe that as a commercial service, people should be licensed, which means they need to take a class and pass an exam to obtain a license. A digital interactive class/exam would be more than adequate. I don't see why it needs to take more than 5-10 hours or cost more than a small fee.

There's no practical reason that a hair braider would need such extensive training and licensure if they don't perform any services beyond braiding. We don't ask EMTs and first responders to have medical degrees and licenses to practice medicine to do their jobs, and they arguably encounter more severe health and safety issues in their line of work.

If the state can provide people a free class and exam online to get a boating permit, then most certainly they can make the same available for braiders for under $50 (boat titles cover the cost of those permit classes, so I feel a small fee for this is acceptable).",t2_bu2x8,Silound,0,1648605151.0,0,t1_i2nv1nh,i2nv1nh,True,semaj_2026,t3_trtlnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Acadiana/comments/trtlnd/hairstylists_to_file_lawsuit_against_louisiana/,Hairstylists to file lawsuit against Louisiana for braiding license requirements,/r/Acadiana/comments/trtlnd/hairstylists_to_file_lawsuit_against_louisiana/i2nv1nh/,12,r/Acadiana,0,12

"True story. Over a decade ago, I noticed an increase in school bus accidents. So, I requested the data from the state on all things school bus related. The contact with the state was cordial, and was interested to see the results (I was using the data to run regression models and write a research paper for an Economics class). Based on the data and said regression analysis, I showed a correlation between low bus driver salary and high accident rates. Basically, the lower the salary in a parish, the greater the driver shortage, the longer the route (fit into a smaller time constraint), and the higher the accident rate. I wrote the paper, and it ended up being selected to be presented at an economic conference and being published in the proceedings. I shared the paper with the connection at the state, and he said, ""If I had known this is what you would have done with the data, I wouldn't have given it to you."" Sad, but true.

Bottom line: low bus driver salary leads to driver shortages, which in turn leads to longer routes per driver, while remaining within the same time constraints of a shorter route, which leads to taking more chances while driving, resulting in higher accident rates. Common sense really, but the state fails to see it as such.",t2_cb0nbpc0,WordySpark,0,1648571527.0,0,t1_i2kzirc,i2kzirc,True,ILoveYou_HaveAHug,t3_tql56q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Acadiana/comments/tql56q/save_the_children_bring_back_redflex/,"Save the children, bring back RedFlex!",/r/Acadiana/comments/tql56q/save_the_children_bring_back_redflex/i2kzirc/,9,r/Acadiana,0,9

"the NEED comes from the southern parishes every few years needing to evacuate due to storms. every time it happens Evangeline Thruway is a nightmare.  it is the bottle neck. so for over 30 years every stoplight on the southern corridor from (about) bayou vista to Broussard has been converted to an overpass/exit.

the PROBLEM is getting through lafayette by putting 14 miles of elevated highway using the railroad or E.T.  right of way is not only a massively expensive project, there are deep concerns it will economically divide lafayette further.

high profile examples in Louisiana (Westbank expressway and Claiborne's elevated I10) provide examples of how these lines divide communities where one side thrives and the other chokes off.

"Peppertree is near the mall. there will be lots of traffic. I can't overstate this... at certain times of day you'll need to find the least amount of left turns possible to get where you are going. be a safe & focused driver! An accident can only clog it up more. Aside from that, it should be safe. Since it is near the mall, if you have kids, common sense says to keep an eye on them for fast traffic, drunk drivers, and hooligan mall rats. And be safe in terms of apartment living like any other apartment complex. 

People on reddit will rush to tell you Lafayette is a backwater stuck in the 50's. lol. not true. *I've been everywhere, man.* lol. Baltimore, Philly, NYC, Orlando, Dallas, Phoenix, Europe. Wonderful places.... but Lafayette is a special place like no other of cajun and creole culture. There is a bond born from suffering and hard work here that succeeds who you are or what you look like. 

It is a mostly republican area in a red state, Americana roots in many ways, and rooted in catholic family-first values that many call conservative. But i grew up in family tribal conservatism... most people don't know what they're talking about here and are looking to be a victim in a fight that is often in their head, or stuck on one event that didn't go as perfectly as it should've in an imperfect world. They are describing commonalities and nepotism. That happens everywhere naturally and is not perpetrated by nefarious forces. The best way i can describe it is, you get out of it what you put into it. Starting over in a new city is a wonderful experience if you allow it to be. There are good jobs and good communities here if you have the education, training, and work ethic, and as far as i can tell it doesn't really matter who you are and what you look like so long as you can get it done.  

You are moving into the heart of corpo lafayette. It's where all the retail chain stores are. I find people around that area tend to be a bit more anxious (as comes with retail).  When you get settled in, try new things in other neighborhoods, and support local grocers, stores, restaurants, etc. Get to know the owners, make yourself comfortable. Learn to slow down when you have the time. There is beauty in this town for those who are patient. 

A good way to get started socially is to volunteer: festivals, downtown events, cookoffs, marathons, or even at a thriving independent church with lots of people to meet. Lots of concerts and bars and coffee shops for every age group to be social. ULL sports events have great community as well. Just go to a sports event and introduce yourself to people, and you'll be eating their BBQ and in no time. And when invited over for dinner or out for a drink, don't so shy to always turn folksy people down thinking they are just being polite. It's a great honor to be invited into someone's home, and I've learned that with cajun folk they wouldn't say it if they didn't mean it.

"Personally I wouldn't live at Peppertree just because of the location. Yes it's safe and around a lot of businesses but it's also right off Ambassador Caffery (or Johnston St if you go the back way) and traffic is pretty much always awful. If that's not something that bothers you, you should be fine. 

Bayou Oaks is between Kaliste Saloom and Verot School Rd. I know a few friends there that are very happy and while it's still closeish to busy streets, I find it was always easy to get in and out. 

There's also another complex on the corner of Verot School Rd and Pinhook (that has changed names and I don't recall the new name) that is also the same situation as Bayou Oaks with traffic. 

Racism isn't as prevalent anymore in personal interactions but there is always the possibility of asshats. There are tons of gyms and sports complexes that have open play and team leagues for sports. TONS of ponds around for fishing. There is veteran's park with a pond that I always see people fishing at right by Bayou Oaks Apartments. Girard Park although I always hear mixed reviews. Also Lake Martin and Beaver Park for fishing.

"This will likely be an unpopular opinion. 

The reason these apps stink is because the restaurants at least most of them have higher prices than in store. The delivery companies then tack on a bunch of fees bringing order totals very high considering. These high fees are kept by these companies. They are not paid to the drivers. A driver for example in DoorDash is offered a delivery at $2.25. That‚Äôs it. They have to consider if a customer has tipped and how far out the delivery is. No one wants to drive 10 miles in one direction for $2.25. 

The high fees charged by these companies cause customers to either not tip appropriately or not tip at all. Then there‚Äôs all the fraud. It‚Äôs all over the internet on how to use these apps and claim non delivery even though the food is delivered. Tons of videos of people bragging about it while eating their free food. That causes someone to lose that job. Those companies are making all the money while paying next to nothing to the drivers and with gas prices hovering around $4 a gallon who would really want to do those gigs. These drivers depend on tips. And most people are feeling the squeeze of inflation. 

I‚Äôm saying all this as someone who tried to do these apps as a fun little side gig. It‚Äôs not worth it for drivers. I know I‚Äôm not driving 10 miles in one direction for $2.25.

"I saw somebody discussing this issue a while back. They worked as a supervisor or lower end management for one the major shipping companies and they stated that they basically do everything in their power to ignore illicit packages that roll thru. Basically, as long as it's something that can be ignored, like even falling out of the container obvious, they do. It costs a lot time and money to shut down to have the authorities come in and investigate. Also in Lousiana first offense, under 14 grams, is a $100 misdemeanor. Over 14 grams I didnt get the details, but it said the laws were still pretty harsh.

"So, what is happening?

Lynette Mejira is a library activist that has long been pushing back against the Library Board of Control.

This activism well known, she was invited to participate in a sub-committee of the Library Board involving members of the public and board members regarding the creation of Northeast Library.

Landon Boudreaux today emailed her to inform her she was now being removed form the committee, NOT to punish her for exercising free speech, but for saying bad stuff about the board (specifically a Current article whose beginning I screen caped and posted as pic 2).

Stuff she's been vocal about since before being put on the special committee.

"No worries, glad to help. This stuff can be confusing sometimes because there's not always consistent terminology used among the various coffee shops. Like the term ""iced coffee"" technically just means cold coffee served over ice, while cold brew is one specific method of making iced coffee (as opposed to making it as a double-strength hot coffee first and then diluting with ice). So you might find some places that just list it as ""iced coffee"" on their menu, while it is actually made with the cold brew method. 

It seems like cold brew has become the more popular method in recent years, so there's a good chance that if a shop serves iced coffee but they don't specify how it's made, it probably is cold brew. Of course, asking the barista should (in theory) help, but even they might get tripped up by the lingo sometimes if they are not one of the more knowledgeable ones.  


And of course, when it comes to confusion of lingo in the coffee industry, Starbucks is often a major culprit ha. I used to work there. For the longest time, they used a hot brew method for their iced coffee. It was only w/in the last 10 years that they started offering cold brew as well because they realized how popular it was becoming. But a certain segment of their customers really liked their original iced coffee, so they just do both.  


The drip-style iced coffee you might also hear referred to as ""Japanese style"". Then to further confuse things, shops like Reve might also over a ""Kyoto style,"" which uses this apparatus that looks kinda like a big hour glass. Ice is placed in the top chamber and then it just slow drips through coffee grounds below as the ice melts.

"I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôre trolling or not but this World Cup was given to a very corrupt nation who has never been known for soccer. They don‚Äôt even have a real team.  On top of that, the tournament had to be moved to the winter to make up for the fact that it‚Äôs ungodly hot there in the summer. This move will hurt all of the leagues around the world for various reasons but the biggest controversy is that the stadiums were built using literal slave labor. Thousands have and will have have died before the first game even starts. I‚Äôd personally have a hard time trying to watch the cup while reconciling the fact that it was only possible there because of all of the slave labor/migrant worker exploitation and abysmal living conditions for these workers who have their passports confiscated upon arrival and aren‚Äôt allowed to leave the country to return home without their employers permission. Most go home in a body bag. Most Olympics and World Cups come with their fair share of corruption, and many construction projects have a few accidental deaths associated with it but this here in Qatar is on a whole new level.

"You have several things working against you on your whiskey hunt here in Lafayette.

1. Whiskey is highly sought-after by the general public. It's not some hidden secret.
2. The oilfield companies here spend thousands of dollars entertaining customers. Having a hard to get whiskey for a customer is crucial.
3. Whiskey is heavily allocated by the distributor. New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Lafayette get the bottles in that order. With New Orleans getting the Lion's share.

You're not getting a rare bottle from Marcellos. They have their ""list"" of customers who spend money. Ambassador Wine and Spirits has a literal list behind the counter. There are a thousand names on it, but they do actually call you if you're next. Champagne's and Nunu's know what they're doing. Champagnes actually sells at secondary prices in their glass cabinet. One of the people at Champagnes actually recommended an expensive/shitty bottle of whiskey to my wife to give me for Christmas. They're shady. Nunu's keeps bottles for their oilfield customers and regulars tucked away. Both liquor managers know what they have. The smaller stores, the good stuff never goes to them, or it never makes it out of the manager's office.

Albertsons gets it, but unless you have a relationship with the liquor manager you're not getting any. You may get lucky if you go in at an off hour and get the assistant. Rouses gets it, but they know what they have. The key to Rouses is to pick one with a liquor manager who simply does not care, or go when the guy isn't there and have some poor sob look in the back. Rouses on Johnson has a glass case with some of the ""rarer"" whiskeys. Secondary prices.

In my opinion, the ideal situation would be if an Albertsons gets a new liquor manager at one of their stores, and they have no clue what they have.
