Unlike Cal-Firen other fire services get paid hazard pay for as long as things are burning so it is contrary to their interests to stop fires as soon as they start. Two Cal-Fire members died as a direct result of that and manslaughter charges are being prepared if they were not charged already. We'll see how far that goes before it is squashed by Sacramanto.

"While not born in California, I lived in the state the majority of my life. I'm half Puerto Rican.

In 2019, for the first time in my life, in California (SoCal to be more precise), after overhearing me speaking my really bad Spanish, I was told TWICE to go back over the border.

In the late 90s, a Mexican man who my mother had hired to work for her when he and I were both 17yo (late 70s) was run over, again in SoCal, while riding his bike home from work. Whoever ran him over left tire treat marks across his entire head. He had to be taken off life support. I called an old HS friend who had friends in the local PD and asked him what they'd been doing and if they couldn't do more, because our friend had basically been murdered. His response? ""He's just a wetback, what do you care? Our police have more important things to do.""

More recently, in Amador Co, I was shopping at the market and there was a Hispanic couple, older couple, also shopping. I heard twice, ""What are THEY doing here????"" from other shoppers. All white of course because the only reason any POC made a mark on the US census was the presence of Mule Creek State Prison. In that same county I've also heard (white) people say, ""We don't need their kind around here!"" LITERALLY. Until I moved there I had no idea that California had places just like the Deep South and that many, if not most, are racist af.

"There are certain factions of people everywhere, and most certainly here, who are happy to have a reason to justify their asshole behavior towards anyone ""other"". 

No one said anything about a ""majority"" or ""all Mexicans"" until you did, but there was definitely legal and social scrutiny going on - this was a national-interest case involving a pretty, well off blond white lady with two small children, and hundreds of artfully posed professional photographs of her and her beautiful perfect family, who accused two Hispanic monsters of kidnapping her off the street, starving and torturing her for weeks, chaining her, ffs.

Those police sketches SP pulled out of her ass to describe hid the face. How many Mexican ladies have dark hair and hoop earrings? And that's where the description ends.  

""They only spoke Spanish"" she says brokenly through a bruised, lying  face, to throw investigators off her trail. She can f right off, and so can anyone who minimizes her attack on that community, who defends this creature who accused *someone* faceless and generic but *Mexican* of a horrible, desperately evil crime.

Look at her and her hideous deception, instead of manufacturing pretend outrage at anyone defending Hispanics.

The park is very close to the San Francisco Bay Area.  It is also a very interesting area that is worth a days trip.  The primary interest is the trails that include going through caves.  Volcanic activity tossed a lot of large rocks over two canyons.  Eventually erosion cleared out the dirt and sand and created a cave along the path of the creeks.  This creates an amazing hiking trail.  Along with that are the ricks that poke out from the land creating the Pinnacles the park is named after.,t2_r099r,amador9,0,1644547804.0,0,t1_hwge5m4,hwge5m4,True,BlankVerse,t3_spfhyh,https://www.reddit.com/r/norcal/comments/spfhyh/why_are_so_many_people_heading_to_californias/,"Why are so many people heading to California‚Äôs newest national park?

"To a very large extent you see what you look for. We have lived
in the Redding area for 40 plus years, are liberal politically and
have many friends who share the same mindset. I have never

Republican. Ppl in general are friendly, help each other out,
and share a rural ethos of careing about your neighbor. Sure
there are homeless, some religious extremes and other
negatives that you can find most anywhere.

"I mean, I'm from Sonoma, and have family in Roseville, and my dad grew up in Mendocino. I don't have a problem with Republicans or rural areas, but Shasta has a different and wierd dynamic. It's fiercely anti-government like Humboldt, Tehama and a lot of the other counties up there that grew tons of illegal weed, it has the normal simmering resentment of being under the laws passed in the big cities farther south that is common basically everywhere other than LA and the bay, but it also has Bethel and the prison that make it a whole different animal. The real lack of any safety net and lack of enough cops also makes it more of a wild west than somewhere like Chico, Eureka, Ukiah, etc.

"Since I can't see any of your user history, I can't tell you specifically what's going on.  But, chances are very, very high that you got caught up in their anti-spam efforts via no direct offending action on your own.  Very likely, there are some attributes of your account and/or your behavior that signaled you were a ""problem"" account and they shadowbanned you.  This is incredibly common and over the months I have seen many presumably innocent new reddit users get caught up in it.

My advice is to go to the appeal link I provided and appeal it.  If you're innocent, you'll have your account restored to normal status pretty quickly.  If there is some problematic behaviors on your account, I'd hope they'd identify them for you and give you a chance to correct it.  If I had to bet, based solely on these two comments (which are the only things I can see of your reddit activity), I'd bet it's 99% chance you're just an innocent that's gotten caught up in all of this and the admins will quickly rectify it.

Don't just sit on it.  Take action.  It's easy and non-confrontational.  It's an every day thing for the admins you'll be interfacing with.",t2_797lb,loonling,0,1644010578.0,0,t1_hvm7s0i,hvm7s0i,False,woodiediscountsamaz,t3_sk0lit,https://www.reddit.com/r/norcal/comments/sk0lit/best_scenic_views_in_norcal_from_indoor_location/,"Best scenic views in NorCal from indoor location (e.g. restaurant, winery, coffee bar, etc)?",/r/norcal/comments/sk0lit/best_scenic_views_in_norcal_from_indoor_location/hvm7s0i/,1,r/norcal,0,1

I thought you'd want to know that the reddit admins (paid reddit employees) have shadowbanned your account. While I as a moderator (unpaid volunteer) on this subreddit can see your posts and/or comments made to this subreddit, regular redditors can not. You appear to be acting in good faith, but your posts and comments are automatically ""spammed"" everywhere on reddit and are likely to only be visible to moderators on various subs if they look for spammed posts and comments. Individual mods may choose to approve your posts and/or comments, so your results may vary from sub to sub. On this subreddit, we will remove your comments and posts until you get this sorted out.

You can verify all of this by looking at your user profile while logged out or opening your user profile while in Incognito mode.

Check out /r/amishadowbanned/ , /r/ShadowBan/ , or /r/ShadowBanned/ for help and information. You can appeal the admins' decision at https://www.reddit.com/appeals/. If (when) you get your shadowban lifted, let us know.

Unfortunately, there is nothing else we moderators can do to help you remove the shadowban. Reddit does not empower the moderators with either the insight or tools to resolve this for you. We did not cause this or have a say in it. This is between you and the reddit admins. You will have to contact the administrators directly, not the moderators of this subreddit. Use the appeal link above to contest your shadowban, or use the other links above to learn a bit more about the shadowban process.

"I can see this being somewhat effective, and probably a good thing overall in reducing risk in some areas and helping with the number of insurance claims statewide.   Even though I disagree with it in principle.  

People are building and buying houses in places they shouldn‚Äôt, and then being surprised when they burn up.    The only way to see the scale of the problem is to fly in a small plane over the wild land/urban interfaces of the state, something I‚Äôve incidentally done for work for years.

So 32 hours and everything after would be overtime in this bill. I would be willing to bet most businesses just move employees to 32 hours and hire another at part time with a staggered schedule to avoid the overtime payout. If this actually goes anywhere I see it failing. That being said I Personally work at a company that is 3 12 hour day on and 4 days off then the following week 4 12 hour day and 3 days off.

"The trees in the background are too far away for Agate beach. There would be sandy bluffs much closer than what is in the background. Maybe they walked from agate beach all the way to big lagoon and took the shot?

Edit: Also agate beach doesnt have much plant life growing on the beach. The beach vegetation starts up towards big lagoon.

as far as drag racing, you will want to take a trip up to [sonoma](https://www.sonomaraceway.com/) or a bit further, just north of Sacramento to Willows for [Thunder Hill](https://thunderhill.com/)  

There used to be alot of autocross that happened out on treasure island in the bay, but that got gentrified out of there. not sure where that happens anymore.

if you arent into the tracks or the actual races, you can check out some of the local drivers spots like [Alice's Restaurant](http://www.alicesrestaurant.com/)  I head out there at least once a week on my bike.  There is also [Downtown Local](https://goo.gl/maps/hKpbb3uYQUYBo8Xa9) in Pescadero.  that town basically survives on drivers who pass through to drive the amazing roads around there.

not as organized but [The Peakers](https://goo.gl/maps/8tnTg3inDWthWY55A) are still a thing... kinda.  People drive up to the top of grizzly peak to watch the sunset alot and most times it is in classic cars or nice bikes.

and lastly for this post (there are so many more too) Downtown hayward, on Mission there used to be meet ups every Friday night at [1/4 lb Giant burger](https://goo.gl/maps/9mfAMhTkrEeNMHdE7), although i havent been through there in a few years, so I dont know if its still happening.  I know that is a bit of a drive for you but I would also check out some of the city specific subs.  I bet there is a pretty decent car culture out in [Santa Cruz](https://old.reddit.com/r/santacruz/) or closer to you in [San Jose](https://old.reddit.com/r/SanJose/).  

Hell, back in the 90s all the best street racing was in SJ.

Check out the app Meetup as well,  lots of car / motorcycle groups on there looking for like minded people.  Or, if your heading up the coast, hit me up. I can show you all the dope roads on the peninsula.

"For years, there were fires caused by downed power lines but the Courts generally dismissed them as ‚ÄúActs of God‚Äù so PG&E wasn‚Äôt liable and had no reason to do anything about it.  This went on for years yet it was obvious that the savings PG&E enjoyed; passed on to their ratepayers and stockholders, was a fraction of the losses incurred by property owners; much of it passed on to Insurance companies and local, state and federal agencies.  PG&E was able to get away with this for so long because of their lobbying power over State Government.  Their logic was clear: ‚Äúwhy should we spend a penny to save someone else a dollar?‚Äù.  This went on for years.

Now the law has changed and PG&E is suddenly liable for the fires they cause.  The company is having to remove hazards that have existed for years.  This takes time and a lot of money.  There is a change in company culture that is is taking hold very slowly: ‚Äúall that pressure to get the job done on time and under budget and now we have to worry about fires; WTF‚Äù.  

PG&E didn‚Äôt start every fire in California and Climate Change is really the underlying cause of the big increase in Mega-fires, but Billions could have been saved had PG&E implemented reforms earlier when it became obvious what was happening.  I don‚Äôt exactly what the lesson is here.  Corporations are going to to The Right Thing, for their stockholders and our elected representatives are going to represent the interests of those who support them financially above those who vote.

"With the 2020 fire season finally over, I had hopes for 2021.   Even the governor proclaimed PG&E a different, changed company.  Then came the PG&E caused 2021 Dixie Mega-Fire, ultimately burning about a million acres.   While California was regulating things like pollution from gas weed eaters, the new PG&E Mega-Fire had a lot of the US choking in wildfire smoke for many weeks.    A physician friend in the Rockies reported a big surge in respiratory patients from the CA wildfire.   

In CA, a less efficient woodstove is forbidden.   But a utility caused wildfire that produces unregulated and uncontrolled massive amounts of the most toxic ultrafine particles, everyone breathing them in, is apparently OK.    The Paradise fire victims are still waiting for fair compensation after the destruction of their lives and homes.   They can‚Äôt live in or eat the PG&E stock certificates they were given.  Now Greenville CA residents had their community destroyed by PG&E.   How long will they wait?   Will they ever get real help?   Are there any consequences for PG&E burning 70% of Lassen Volcanic National Park?

But CA sets up a $20 billion fund, funded by the public, qualifies PG&E for insurance under it because PG&E supposedly meets the wildfire safety requirements (what a joke!).   And now Greenville victims are waiting for relief, apparently from the fund.   Nothing much out of PG&E‚Äôs pocket, or their shareholder‚Äôs pockets?    And the shareholders are protected by a devious plan that makes Paradise fire victims additional shareholders, so any action that hurts shareholders in the pocketbooks will be denounced as hurting fire victims.   Diabolical.   

So what do we get from PG&E in 2022?   A plan to supposedly underground some lines sometime in the future.   They will hit some low hanging fruit, bury a few easy to reach lines in a big show, and proclaim how great they are.   Will Californians, and indeed the nation, be choking on PG&E wildfire smoke in 2022?

"Sounds interesting.   The in stream flows are vital, no doubt.   Lot of debate on the effectiveness of increasing them though.   The delta has changed so much, and is at the heart of everything.   Anadromous fish have to pass through the delta, smelt obviously live in the delta, all the water goes through the delta, whether it goes to the ocean or pumps.    Yet the delta has been irreversibly changed so much are some of those species relics now?   When you look at the effects of land use, invasive species (fish, plants, and now maybe mammals‚Ä¶) let alone all the effects of water transfers, upstream diversions, etc.   It makes a person wonder if some species are sustainable.   There‚Äôs like you said, 38 million people who depend on that water.  There‚Äôs houses and farms all over, you can‚Äôt change it back.   So it‚Äôs scary to think about, but we have a huge footprint on the land, and it‚Äôs going to be affected.   Especially an area like the delta.

"California does have an incredible amount of infrastructure in place already.   Yes, there‚Äôs improvements that could be made, but all the easy cost effective projects are done.   I also wouldn‚Äôt say we get little rain, there‚Äôs an incredible amount of runoff from the sierra‚Äôs and northern mountains every year.   The biggest issue is the management of that water.   Environmental flows have increased, which leaves less water in reservoirs for carryover for dry years.   As you mentioned, California has a climate and soils that allows for California to grow crops that can‚Äôt be grown elsewhere, especially in certain seasons.   That takes water, and needs to be acknowledged that we all like lettuce in February.  Agriculture needs water to do that.    Biggest reason farmers are using more groundwater is deliveries from surface water canals have been cut to reallocate that water for other uses, usually in stream environmental flows.   That‚Äôs important, but so is keeping farms viable.   Desalination is good, but expensive.   With more solar it could be viable if there‚Äôs cheaper electricity, but solar is still to intermittent.   Need more storage for electricity, but that‚Äôs a whole other subject.",t2_ip29fy1,BarrioVen,0,1641771574.0,0,t1_hrzhqj6,hrzhqj6,False,BlankVerse,t3_rygu7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/norcal/comments/rygu7e/development_of_ultraluxury_northern_california/,Development of ultra-luxury Northern California resort stopped due to wildfire risk ‚Äî 25-square-mile development in Lake County's Guenoc Valley,/r/norcal/comments/rygu7e/development_of_ultraluxury_northern_california/hrzhqj6/,1,r/norcal,0,1

"On the one hand, an increase in property tax revenue should help the locals with local expenses like schools and fire service.

On the other hand massive income inequality with locals way at the left of the bell curve and newcomers way over at the right could just lead to more problems.

If a bunch of rich people moved in to a poor county, I would expect them to overtake local politics and change laws to minimize taxes. I also don‚Äôt imagine the ultra-rich would be shopping locally or hiring locals for anything other than poverty wages.

The bigger issue is why tf do local property taxes fund schools? There should be a statewide pool of funds and everyone student gets the same amount.

Where in Northern California are you going to? To answer your question. All wood on the ground is up for grabs. You cant cut anything down per se (nor would you want to). You don't need wood tags or a permit unless you plan on transporting the wood. In that case you need to tag it just in case you get stopped by the feds and asked about. Gathering firewood around campsites is completely legal and free. Firewood at grocery stores and campsites suck.  It's always so rotten and barely gives off much heat and you don't get enough of it anyway. There's plenty of places along the road sides (mostly personal residences) that advertise firewood for sale. I live in Mendocino county and have a fuck ton of wood if you are down this way.

"Er. No. I didn't explain myself properly, and assumed that you were on the hook for all your utilities. 

Regardless of what air temp you've got the HVAC set to, you're going to use gas to heat water.

But, since it's not on your bill, that doesn't matter.

Since you said landlord, I'm going to assume that you're in an apartment setup. Likely your neighbors are heating your home a bit due to shared walls/ceiling/floor, depending on the layout of the building.

But, let's do math!

https://www.ferrellgas.com/tank-talk/blog-articles/how-many-btus-you-need-to-heat-your-home-shop-garage-and-more/

The formula is:

(desired temperature change) x (cubic feet of space) x .133 = BTUs needed per hour.

In this case, a 10 degree bump, from 60 to 70.

One therm is about 99976 BTU. 

So. Measure your place out. 

I stand by my suspicion that your meter is faulty, and that your usage is different.

Also: https://www.pge.com/tariffs/GRF.SHTML#RESGAS

If you want to look up what you should be paying for gas. I'd be surprised if your gas bill was $2/day this month.

"McArthur is the entry point to one of Californias most remote and fascinating state parks, Ahjumawi Lava Springs State Park.   

http://www.paddlingcalifornia.com/Big_Lake.html

A reason it is so little known and little used, you will need a kayak or canoe to access it.   Once you paddle in, there are miles of hiking trails.   Many who drive through McArthur never know or suspect the park is there. 

The communities in that region, Burney, McArthur, Fall River Mills, and the rural areas around them, are prime places if you cherish easy access to lots of outdoor recreation.   The climate is nice, four seasons but not extreme.  

But there are some major potential negatives to owning a place there or anywhere like there in the forested part of California now.   The biggest risk is wildfire.  In the last few years, huge megafires have swept through beautiful forested areas of California turning them into moonscapes.  Some of the worst are started by PG&E, and there appears to be little likelihood that it is going to be held accountable enough that it stop starting fires anytime soon.   Then you have the US Forest Service which owns most of the land in that region and others.   Bottom line, in this era of huge fire risk, it brings insufficient resources into play, and belatedly.  When much of CA is burning, it‚Äôs limited resources are spread way too thin.  This is not to take away from the individual heroism, incredible heroism, of firefighters.  But those who live near forested regions managed by the USFS have watched in horror, using satellite imaging and detection, as a lone tree lights up in a lightning storm, burns in the wilderness and eventually, sometimes weeks later, the resulting unattended fire spreads, gets bigger, finally encounters a wind event, and a new home destroying megafire is born.  The satellite technology is there to detect very small fire starts, and if aircraft were poised and ready, a burning tree likely to cause an eventually megafire could be out very quickly.   As it is, a homeowner in that whole greater region risks choking on toxic wildfire smoke all summer, and maybe worse, loss of a home in fire.  Or at least cancellation of fire insurance, which is happening a lot in forested regions. 

The other problem in such regions in California, and particularly in Shasta County, is crime.   The county jail is inadequate in capacity and the state has declined to incarcerate felons who commit property crimes and has shifted responsibility for them to the counties.  But counties like Shasta just do not have the facilities to deal with these criminals who should be state responsibility.  So the state is closing prisons, and property crime is a huge problem, especially in Shasta.  Lots of great people in the area, but they are faced with expanding crime with inadequate resources to deal with it.   Bottom line, the way it is going, a vacation home owner doesn‚Äôt know whether the place is going to be intact or not on return visits.  In a worst case, it may even have squatters if vacant for extended periods. 

Bottom line, I travel a considerable distance to visit Ahjumawi, but would not live in that scenic region (or anywhere forested in CA) until the state and the USFS get their acts together.  PG&E will make a big show of burying a few conspicuous and easy lines, and the state will coddle them, until the next megafire they start destroys another million acres like the last one.  And destroys lots of homes and makes more uninsurable.",t2_a3grotks,Appropriate-Clue2894,0,1640436095.0,0,t1_hpwu518,hpwu518,True,eggpudding389,t3_ro3vd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/norcal/comments/ro3vd2/anyone_live_to_or_been_to_mcarthur_ca/,"Anyone live to or been to McArthur, CA?",/r/norcal/comments/ro3vd2/anyone_live_to_or_been_to_mcarthur_ca/hpwu518/,6,r/norcal,0,6

If state lines weren't just imaginary things, and you let the water do what the water does without interference, you will find the water doesn't choose to pipe itself down to the city built in the desert on the ocean. The water argument has been brought up several times, but seemingly it's always followed the same priority of handling local needs before excess is diverted to down south. This is fine, and is better than the water returning to the ocean, but to suggest that farmers drilling wells if a problem is crazy. 

Lastly, if one drop of NorCal water is used to water a golf course in what would otherwise be a desert and someone has the opinion it shouldn't be used to grow food, then I think your nuts, and not the prized almonds and walnuts that are shipped internationally, like in my home town, Chico nut is the main supplier for Hersey chocolate bars and others",t2_h3nh1mfz,Dikubus,0,1639760680.0,0,t1_hoxtwii,hoxtwii,False,BlankVerse,t3_rhv909,https://www.reddit.com/r/norcal/comments/rhv909/a_frenzy_of_well_drilling_by_california_farmers/,A frenzy of well drilling by California farmers leaves residents without running water,/r/norcal/comments/rhv909/a_frenzy_of_well_drilling_by_california_farmers/hoxtwii/,2,r/norcal,0,2
