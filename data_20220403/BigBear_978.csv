"They're done with snowmaking for the season. They've already spent their budget and water allotment for the season. Snowmaking is stupid expensive, something like $10k/hr (or more, I forget the exact number) between labor, power/fuel (Bear is on utility power while Summit uses 6x 2MW generators for the compressors and fan guns), and water from MWD.

There's a few more factors: This late in the season with weather getting warmer down the hill, fewer people come up to ride instead opting for the beach, removing the financial incentive. The temps aren't low enough at night for the most part to make great snow. And the highs during the day are enough to melt it off an entire night's production. Both mountains have it down to a science, and there's a reason they only go from November to February most years. Around this time, they'll start closing runs and pushing snow to the popular runs.

Convicted Felon Arrested After Fleeing from Stolen Vehicle, Hiding from Deputies, and Providing False ID  
 	   
DATE/TIME: March 24, 2022, 10:31 a.m.  
INCIDENT: Felon Arrested After Fleeing from Deputies  
LOCATION: 43000 block of Sheephorn Rd., Big Bear Lake  
SUSPECT: Bobby Eaton, 30-year-old resident of Big Bear City  
SUMMARY: At approximately 10:30 a.m. on March 24, 2022, deputies   
observed a reported stolen vehicle traveling on Moonridge Road. Upon   
seeing the deputy, the driver quickly turned the vehicle into a   
residential driveway and fled on foot into the wooded area surrounding   
nearby homes. While pursuing the subject on foot, deputies located a   
loaded handgun on the ground in the direct path taken by the subject.  
Additional patrol units and aerial support from the Sheriff’s Aviation   
Division responded to check the area. The subject, later identified as   
30-year-old Bobby Eaton, was located in a shed and detained. Deputies   
confirmed Eaton’s identity after he initially provided a false name.  
During the investigation, deputies confirmed Eaton is currently on Post   
Release Community Supervision (PRCS) for a prior conviction of being a   
felon in possession of a gun/ammunition.  
Eaton was transported and booked at West Valley Detention Center on   
felony charges of being in possession of stolen property, being a   
convicted felon in possession of a firearm, providing false   
identification to a law enforcement official, evading a peace officer,   
and violation of PRCS terms and conditions. Suspect Bobby Eaton remains   
in custody without the possibility of bail, pending court procedures   
scheduled for March 28, 2022, at the San Bernardino Justice Center.",t2_ciiccmkj,Hikityup,0,1648244261.0,0,t1_i24a26t,i24a26t,False,Astartledbox,t3_tmsx2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigbear/comments/tmsx2z/helicopter_flying_over_moonridge_with_loudspeaker/,Helicopter flying over Moonridge with loudspeaker,/r/bigbear/comments/tmsx2z/helicopter_flying_over_moonridge_with_loudspeaker/i24a26t/,2,r/bigbear,0,2

"Ah the ol' ""someone's wrong on the internet."" I hear ya, we all got our priorities and POVs depending on our income level and financial ideals and the only way to bring change is to maneuver within the bounds of the law.

I may vote for her again if that's the case.

"Mammoth definitely has an advantage as it's not three parts passing itself off as one. It has residential only zones in order to retain its residents and prohibit STRs in those areas.

Wasn't it in Sugarloaf that a STR tenant burned down a neighboring home with fireworks? I'm in Bear Lake and I've seen them the last two 4th of July's, with indifference from enforcement when called.

"The rush of visitors during COVID really did spur a huge jump in the housing prices here in the last 2 years but even before that the cost of homes was climbing at a rate far above the increase in wages. Now it is quite crazy. I'm thinking there will be a correction in the housing prices but it doesn't seem likely that will happen and if it does it is unlikely to go back to where it was years ago without some major changes in the way housing is thought of.

We are surrounded by STRs and a few second homes and we haven't had any issues for many months, including the peak of the winter season. We definitely haven't seen any unruly STR visitors in over a year. Perhaps it is much different in the county areas where they are just getting their STR rules and enforcement started. I hope the county can get those few troublesome renters under control soon. Most of the population of the valley is in county areas so it is really an even larger problem valley-wide than in the small incorporated city area!

"A large part of what drove prices up here so quickly is the fact that investors were buying homes in order to turn them into STRs, paying tens of thousands of dollars over the asking price while making them unattainable to local residents. Every other community saw the STR problem coming and dealt with it through zoning, but Big Bear either shoved its head in the sand or up some investors behinds. 

I would love to buy a home in order to stay in this community but I'd like to live in a residentially zoned area, and even Erwin isn't safe from the STR invasion.  They are out of control and personally, I don't want to live in a commercial zone for underregulated hotels. STRs allow for random vagrants to pass through neighborhoods, including sex offenders.

"New information leads to new thinking. A year ago I was just starting to understand how much of a problem this is. Since then I have learned so much more about the issue.

What I have been hearing from second home owners is that most short-term rentals would turn back into private second homes as most second home owners here want to enjoy their home regularly and you can't do that if you have a long-term renter in your home. At this point I don't know what would help create more affordable long-term rentals but I am glad some businesses are trying to help their employees.

I heard a podcast yesterday (Factually! with Adam Conniver - Why Is Housing So Expensive In America? with Jenny Schuetz) that talked about how the root of the housing trouble we are facing across more and more of the US is due decisions made decades ago that have made homes the only place to put your money that can grow in value as the current near zero interest rates make savings accounts useless, causing homes to be a financial commodity rather than a place for people to live in. It all seems like a crazy mess.

Getting rent to be more affordable and getting more long-term rentals in our valley is the biggest real issue we and a lot of the country are facing. Sadly the solution is way above my pay-grade. But I am happy to speculate along with everyone else on how we can solve this.

Perhaps incentivizing developers to build more condos, townhouse, and apartments would be a solution but I would love to see more options for ownership of homes so I would want to see more condos and townhouses and perhaps even tiny houses. But that is just a patch to a crazy system that monetarily rewards people who own homes and punishes those who rent.

I am all for strong regulations and strict enforcement or STRs which our city have implemented with great success. With that taken care of and once Alan is reigned in the city's brainpower will be able to focus on the long-term rental problem full steam ahead. They have already taken small steps forward, clearing several unused city properties and setting up incentives for developers to build affordable housing on those properties.

Greg, 

Knowing small business owners who cannot afford to live in the town themselves, I highly doubt they will be housing their employees. Also, that seems like a few steps backwards in time and an antiquated concept.

From memory, I think our decks are about 1400 sq ft total. Only the large one is Redwood and full sun South facing. You gotta at least knock off the peeling(s). I use an angle grinder w/the black sand paper and disc adapter. Both are at Butcher's. Blending any bare wood to paint areas.

Super Deck I've only used as a stain on a client's deck. Just fades to nothing eventually, maybe lasts 2-3 years without pets. Australian Timber oil is about the same, but a bit thicker so it seems to last a bit longer.

"Frank Rush has done an amazing job of being more open and communicative. His weekly and often more frequent newsletters have been great for getting the information about what is going on in the city out there.

My two pressing questions are: 1) what made Alan this way and 2) what is Alan really trying to accomplish? Everything he says is so full of lies and exaggerations that it is difficult to believe he understands what facts are other than things to pick bits of that suit his purposes. He has said many times that his staff or team is working on things. No other council member in the history of this city has had a staff or team, it is just crazy. Months ago he said he was hiring an assistant who would be getting involved in things but no sign of that person has been seen, so no idea what that was all about.

The last year plus has been super painful for those that have had to deal with Alan up close and in person. It is nice to see that more of the community is finally seeing what is happening.

"Poking around on the internet, specifically on websites that discuss buying single family property for the purpose of financial gains through short or long term rental, I came across a discussion on Big Bear real estate from about 2 years ago or so. In this thread, one person claimed to already own 20 properties in Big Bear, all being run as STRs. 

I understand there are now rules in place to prevent this going forward (good!), but it didn't prevent it from happening in the first place and those multi-property owners are grandfathered in. To say STRs are all 1-for-1 with second-home owners and wouldn't be providing housing otherwise is disingenuous. There are many other resort areas which have had their character severely damaged by STRs, because it's the projected rent from STRs that enables many to purchase in the first place and, consequently, drives up the price of housing. Big Bear is into the curve now, still with a chance to prevent the near catastrophe that some of these other towns have run into. One story I read said one area was down to a single coffee shop because there aren't enough full time residents anymore to staff two.

I don't have a dog in this fight, but I can say that when we visited Big Bear recently and tried to get lunch at 11:30AM, the first restaurant we tried to eat told us it was a 3 hour wait. I asked about all the empty tables, and I was told they have the tables, they don't have the staff. We went across the street to a place that looked half-full, and were surprised to hear it was a 90 minute wait, because they didn't have enough cooks to handle more than about 50% occupancy at their tables. This is a problem for Big Bear, this does not make us want to come back. Some businesses may not survive because they can't hire employees, and if they fail, they might move away meaning fewer local workers, and you get a downward spiral.

I will also relate something my wife and I saw while driving around the neighborhoods in the Moonridge area. We saw 3 different STRs with 20-30 people in the front yard on a Sunday morning. I'm pretty sure that isn't supposed to be happening. I understand there is a code compliance hotline, but what if the surrounding homes are also STRs, who notices, who calls? My eyes tell me that the regulations you mention have not eliminated the problems.

A balance needs to be struck, maybe the balance is there now. Based on our personal experience visiting the area, it sure doesn't seem like it. Perhaps what Big Bear actually needs is more hotels and hotel rooms. With more hotels (at good prices or with notable amenities), demand for STRs reduces. If STRs can't make money, home turnover increases and prices stop skyrocketing, or even fall. There is no doubt in my mind that a lot of people would not keep their property if it wasn't being supported or profitable through STRs, and I say that as someone who owns an STR, just not in Big Bear..",t2_eloedasg,jhinsd,0,1646724365.0,0,t1_hzt8i6s,hzt8i6s,False,TrailNoggin,t3_t8ugdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigbear/comments/t8ugdu/can_i_have_an_explanation_what_alan_lee_did_or/,Can I have an explanation what Alan Lee did or did not do?,/r/bigbear/comments/t8ugdu/can_i_have_an_explanation_what_alan_lee_did_or/hzt8i6s/,7,r/bigbear,0,7

Closest I could parse out from your POV is that Alan Lee has made false claims but then you just allude to vague accusations yourself.

I *maybe* could see your take on what you believe causes rental shortage, but its my understanding that if the STRs were capped some second homeowners would opt for long term renters over making zero income on empty homes. Could be false but when this isn't even acknowledged I get suss!

Also I personally would not get on board with the place I worked at ALSO being my landlord then crossing my fingers my boss paid me enough to pay him/her rent too because wasn't that the setup with mining companies and well I'm not sure it worked out great for the employees.

"I absolutely have a stake in this fight as my wife is a council member here.

Alan has spent his life agitating for the AFSCME union all across the country. He appears to have done well at this as he says he has many homes across the state and country. This experience has also given him a sense of how far he can push the edges of the law without getting in to legal trouble.

He is now a council member. That means he is supposed to be a part of a team making decisions on items presented to them by city staff. Instead he continues to be an agitator disrupting the city's operations for reasons unknown but most likely just for his own ego or perhaps in preparation for a higher office, preferable in a far away place from here.

Alan was appointed to the Big Bear Lake DWP commission in July 2015 and held the position until the end of his term in June 2019 where he managed to reduce the productivity of the DWP to 1/4 of their previous levels. Fortunately he was not reappointed for another term and the DWP has since recovered and has been able to keep the water flowing.

Alan is constantly bullying and disrespectful to city staff, council and citizens who do not do what he wants.

Alan claims he represents the whole valley, trying to get his fingers in hospital, DWP, school business far outside of his official role as representative for the city of Big Bear Lake, District 1.

The worst thing I have noticed is that Alan loves to accuse others of exactly what he is doing wrong.

Alan claims there is voter fraud while having a herd of people registered to vote at his house.

Alan accuses everyone of wasting money while he wastes time and money pontificating endlessly, contributing nothing to discussions at council meetings. Alan is rarely prepared and rarely reads detailed meeting agenda beyond the first pages. Then when it suits his interest he is all for spending hundreds of thousands on unnecessary things.

Alan claims all the council members are getting rich from secret kickbacks. I haven't seen any evidence of this. But I do hear that Alan has collected well over 100,000 dollars in donations from across the country for his ""campaign"", most of it after he had already won the election.

Alan and his Los Angeles based ""team"" make dozens of complex and time consuming public information requests. He is a city council member and is presented with all the information he needs in the agendas he gets before each meeting. Most of his requests are to see if anyone is talking about him.

The city staff and council have been working hard and over the last 2 years have implemented many intelligent and highly successful restrictions on short term rentals. Alan and his pack of rich retired residents have put together an initiative to severely limit short term rentals that is at best poorly written and most likely would be disastrous for the future of the our city. The regulations that have already been enacted have all but eliminated the problems we have had with unruly visitors without restricting the rights of property owners. The initiative is just a game being played by the big babies who didn't get exactly what they wanted.

And to wrap it up: the biggest issue we have in the city right now is affordable housing. This has nothing to do with short term rentals as those homes were all second homes that sat idle most of the year previously and are not likely to become long term rentals even if short term rentals were completely eliminated. This housing problem is across the state with the cost of living rapidly outpacing the wages of most workers. The city is working hard to come up with solutions but there is little they can do as it takes investors to build affordable housing or higher pay for everyone in the state. I am hopeful that more and more businesses will take it upon themselves to buy homes to rent to their employees and also increase wages so all of their employees can afford homes of their own someday.

"I have absolutely no stake in this fight but....

1)  A frequent land mine in City Manager forms of government is micro management by the councilmembers in the day to day running of the city.  This is really problematic for a city manager because they end up chasing their tail on Monday only to be told not to do it on Tuesday and then to chase harder wednesday.  Key here is for the councilmembers to confine themselves to ""policy"" and ideally with a majority vote.

2) STRs are a pain and a half.  But in a town like Big Bear the challenge is the cost of services continues to escalate \_AND\_ Transient occupancy tax is one of the ""best"" sources of income the state provides (a low percentage of property taxes goes to cities and unless a LOT of turn over in properties it doesn't increase at a rate faster than wage inflation) and sales tax is shrinking as people buy more stuff on line (complicated allocation formula) and more services than goods.",t2_9nrcbcxy,lowcal2,0,1646684367.0,0,t1_hzqwn3h,hzqwn3h,True,TrailNoggin,t3_t8ugdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigbear/comments/t8ugdu/can_i_have_an_explanation_what_alan_lee_did_or/,Can I have an explanation what Alan Lee did or did not do?,/r/bigbear/comments/t8ugdu/can_i_have_an_explanation_what_alan_lee_did_or/hzqwn3h/,6,r/bigbear,0,6
"Good catch on that Rush situation. What was being said publicly, both here and in Tahoe, didn't quite match up with the realities. He walked from Tahoe when the STR situation heated up. It was clear where he was standing on it. And his role prior to Tahoe was a roadmap on how to monetize a resort area. All about money.

And now it appears the Council is looking to terminate him. On the surface it's looking more and more like there might be someone in there who's on a power trip and it's their way or the highway.

"You can definitely have fun at Bear if you love park, but there’s fun park elements over at Snow Summit as well. You might want to hit Westridge area at Summit on day 2 morning and then decide if you want to continue there or go back to Bear for mid-day. Shuttles run every 30 min between resorts.

Snow conditions vary there with the weather, if it’s sunny 50s during the day then things start icy in the morning and soften up as the day goes, turning to sticky soup at the base around 1-1:30 and also slow and sticky at mid mountain, but sometimes it can start to firm back up just before close. In other words, to maximize your days, get on the slopes early, stop for lunch late, and see you can get a few last laps just before close. Just because the snow gets sucky at 1 or so doesn’t necessarily mean it’s garbage the rest of the day. 
Of course if it isn’t warm and sunny then the above won’t apply. ;)

Keep your head on a swivel, lots of inexperienced skiers and boarders at both mountains, and remember the rules of right of way and responsibility. Uphill rider is responsible for avoiding downhill, look uphill when merging, etc. The clueless factor is pretty high at those two mountains, far higher than Mammoth, June, Brian Head, Copper, etc. Expect the slow beginner going through the park, avoiding every feature, is going to idiotically go across the big jump landing zone.",t2_eloedasg,jhinsd,0,1646404179.0,0,t1_hzbiv94,hzbiv94,True,Mustang_Gold,t3_t5zduu,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigbear/comments/t5zduu/first_time_at_bear_mountain/,First Time at Bear Mountain,/r/bigbear/comments/t5zduu/first_time_at_bear_mountain/hzbiv94/,3,r/bigbear,0,3

"Midweek you’ll be able to drive into the main lot if you’re there by 8am no problem. It’s very quiet during the week unless snow fell the night before. Parking in the main lot will be easiest and totally doable during week. A lot of the good food is in the village or town, just depends on what you’re into. Would steer away from eating at resort since it’s very mundane and overpriced. Chair 9 is my favorite run at Bear. You can do blacks or blue down the main hill then hit so many different combo trails from there. Offers a vast array of varied ways down to the base. I don’t do terrain so not good for answering that one. Yes for the most part everyone in big bear is great, can get a little rowdy and annoying on weekends when it’s too crowded. Be nice to the locals and the staff. 

Biggest tip for someone coming up is treat it like it’s your own home and respect others and the mountain. I see too many people who come up and throw beer cans off lifts, fly down so fast they’re almost killing others, blast Post Malone out of their book bags at full volume, get totally hammered and become obnoxious and oblivious to their surroundings etc…

A BBMR midweek pass that is good Mon-Fri (blacked out during Xmas to New Years holiday)

There is an option to signup for the newsletter on the site which will send info when they announce prices for the next season.

"It really depends on your business and the environment you'd like to live in. They're different places. Running Springs sort of splits the difference geography wise but doesn't offer as much infrastructure as Arrowhead or BB. If access to natural environments is your thing then Big Bear. You can't even get to the lake in Arrowhead unless you live on it. They both attract visitors, which is something you really need to consider, but BB gets more because of the resorts and lake. Rentals are crazy hard to find right now. Maybe it'll change - maybe it won't. You do need to make sure that things like retail stores and night life isn't a driver for you. If you live in BB, unless you open a store in the Village, you probably won't spend much time there. Each town in the valley offers something a little different so I might suggest driving up and really spending some time walking/driving Arrowhead and the same in the valley through the eyes of being a resident. Someplace like Fawnskin has a very different vibe than BBL. And remember that BBL is a city and the others fall under the County.

"Hi!

Well, it depends on the person, obviously. I'll tell you we're middle aged, adult children, several dogs, and stable/comfortable incomes. BB is gorgeous, lots of hiking, air is great, it's great not to have to drive for an hour to get to the store. 

Political stuff has been the absolute hardest thing to deal with. BB is hardcore right wing. Not everyone, of course, but a small (I think? maybe large) group is very vocal and very visible. Before the vaccines and around the George Floyd thing, we were terrified to go to Vons, with all the crazies with their blue lives matter flags hanging off their trucks and no masks and just generally a ""mad max"" kind of feel. I have a local friend who had cancer last summer who wore a mask everywhere. She was actively confronted at the post office while mailing a letter, screamed at for being a pussy/wearing a mask/etc. She literally had CANCER. 

We lived in Big Bear City for the first 6 months before we finally bought a house in another part of BB. One day an African American young man (age 18?20? 22?) walked down our street (we found out later his dad had bought a house around the corner). Our neighbor, who I always thought was a nice guy, came barreling out of the house and yelled, ""You're in the wrong neighborhood, boy!"" 

Yeah. So I'm a little freaked out by the politics. 

Food is mediocre across the board as well- but we're foodies. 

That said, there's a great AA meeting in town, there are some super nice people, and I think BB is ripe for development and some cool restaurants and high end stores that don't involve red and black plaid or cartoon bears.

"I agree. There's a causation/correlation fallacy occurring here, which causes people to think their community is the only one suffering. The actual cause of the nation wide housing shortage is the lack of new infrastructure built since 2008, partially to do with the increasing complications and red-tape associated with building new housing, coupled with a shortage of workers in the trades, and massive inflow of institutional cash, From REITs and other groups, who have bought up inventory everywhere, and squeezed people in every market of this country. Add in the fact that the US housing market has become a wildly popular place for foreign investors trying to hide money from their governments.

When you have 2,000 airbnbs you get a LOT of tourists that spend a LOT of money in the area, you need a LOT of workers to service the second homes (maintenance, repairs, cleaning, management, accounting etc.) If anything sounds like limiting Airbnbs in Durango just stopped the tourist money from flowing in and did nothing for the housing crisis.",t2_7w87j,redgreenapple,0,1644341533.0,0,t1_hw3v1oj,hw3v1oj,True,DontBlameMe-221,t3_snk8go,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigbear/comments/snk8go/what_ski_towns_tell_us_about_income_inequality/,What ski towns tell us about income inequality,/r/bigbear/comments/snk8go/what_ski_towns_tell_us_about_income_inequality/hw3v1oj/,4,r/bigbear,0,4

"Awesome! I'm really happy for you! It is a great feeling to realize you've gotten better, building confidence and comfort on your skis, and to look at those runs that used to seem so hard and now you can do them. That will stick with you, next time what took 3 days to get to might take 3 runs or 3 hours, it all depends on conditions and how long it's been. When I haven't been for a while, I always start on a green run just to kind of ""get my feet back"", and I almost always end up asking myself ""what the heck is going on, why are you sucking"" and then I realize some dumb thing I'm doing just from being rusty and out of practice.

"It's not how many seasons, it's how many days in a row you ski.

I had several years of ""going skiing"" for a day at a time and each time I practically felt like a newb because it had been too long. Then I did 3 or 4 days in a row and it was amazing, as I started each day where I'd ended the previous one. Each night, watch YouTube how to ski videos with a progression to them. (video 1, video 2, video 3, etc). Learn from it, lock it in your brain, try it the next day, then watch the next video the next night.

Personally, I would recommend you stick to runs you are familiar with and work on getting better. And maybe don't go to Summit on the weekend, it's hard to focus on your skill and technique when you have to watch out for the mayhem happening around you and worry about the mayhem that might be coming from behind you.

Top tip: Schedule a multi-day, non-holiday-weekend trip to June Mountain or Brian Head.

"If Miracle Mile was a bit much for you there aren't a ton of options short of going to Bear. This said you can go down Miracle Mile and go left for the last face which will make it better. 

Aside from that if you take Chair 2 up and go right, there's the family fun zone. All of that is fairly manageable as long as you don't go down Westridge (the freestyle park). The opposite side of the mountain is going to be a bit more intense than Miracle Mile.

"Are you in any of the Big Bear Facebook groups? You will get a lot more engagement on those groups! I’m always seeing people talking about affordable housing on there. 

1. I am so used to the traffic up here these days, which is horrible even during the off seasons now, I would be willing to commute up to 20-30 minutes, especially if it keeps prices lower. It would be nice if the housing was more away from the big tourist/traffic centers like the village and BBL. 

2. For a 1b/1b in BB I would say that $1200 would be the lowest end of “affordable”. Rent is an absolute cluster fuck up here with how steep prices are. Not to mention how many long term renters are getting kicked out of their homes because the owner wants to turn it into an Airbnb. 

3. I would be looking for a 1b/1b or 2b/1b. I’m married with pets and no kids (yet).

"This is my 3rd season skiing… so I think I should be further along that I am 😂. I have done the green runs off chair 9 but find summit run to be much harder than those. I usually do night skiing to avoid most of the tourists, so I’m used to icy conditions I suppose.
I did notice that the labeling of the runs was messy, which is why I wanted to see if anyone could point me in the right direction of the next step from all the greens. I guess I’m not too concerned about going slow, I just want to challenge myself a little more because I went to a different resort and their green runs were definitely like summit’s blue runs and I felt unprepared for that.

"There are a few options, listed in order of my recommendation as well:

* Stay on Summit Run or visit the greens off Chair 9 until you are more comfortable going faster and in changing conditions. Ice, hard pack, slush, crowds, etc. will all change how the run feels and how you have to ski it. No need to push things too fast.
* Chair 9: An awesome intermediate area. Mainstream is a nice run for a little steeper look. Cruiser and Sundown, while listed as a greens both have a slightly steeper section at the end that is short but good to practice. It is over quick if you aren't feeling it, which is better than getting stuck on Miracle Mile and not liking it. Also this is a 3-pack fixed chair, a little harder to load and unload from compared to the detachable quads that slow down in the loading zones.
* Chair 1/2: Upper Miracle Mile to Hog Back, and then Summit Run (AKA Interlude) the rest of the way down, and skip Steilhang (the middle Miracle Mile face, actually a black run) and Widowmaker (the bottom face of Miracle Mile, blue or black depending on conditions). Once you feel good on the little Hog Back section, then add in Widowmaker at the end. Also note, Summit Run and Miracle Mile are a mess with the naming and signage. There are sections on the map that just don't have names and others that have multiple names, and it doesn't always match what the signs say on the hill so it can be hard to find your way. Feel free to ask Ski Patrol or Hill Safety to point it out on map if you are confused.
* Chair 7: Timber Ridge and 7 Down. Both are not too hard, but the fall line doesn't match the direction of the run, so you may feel turning one direction is harder than another and like you are sliding off the run. But they are pretty wide runs and often not many people over there, so you should have good room to practice. Chair 7 is an older 2-seater fixed chair that has a quick pickup and can be harder than Chair 9, so make sure you are comfortable on that style chair or ask them to slow it down until you are. If you are at the bottom you can just ask the liftie, if you are coming up to the top just give them the thumbs down signal and they will slow it if they see you.",t2_dtw4j,FearAndGonzo,0,1643594211.0,0,t1_huxr5y5,huxr5y5,True,pickles_n_icecubes,t3_sgo30r,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigbear/comments/sgo30r/easiest_blue_square_at_snow_summit/,Easiest blue square at snow summit?,/r/bigbear/comments/sgo30r/easiest_blue_square_at_snow_summit/huxr5y5/,6,r/bigbear,0,6

"There’s a fire pit with chairs and tables just up from the restaurant at the base - not sure it’s lit all the time, maybe later in the afternoon, but you could ask!  
Also, there’ a restaurant, bar (top floor) and cafeteria (middle floor) up the hill (on the right looking up) that is easier for a snowboarder to get to if you’re meeting for lunch, they have two decks, one up in the sun and one down a flight of steps that’s shaded later in the day - you can walk up the hill to get to that, just stay far to the right so you don’t get hit by a rider.  
There’s also a tubing area just up from the firepit- have to buy a ticket but it’s something to do that isn’t skiing or boarding!  

Don’t forget your shades!  it’s really bright looking at snow.  Have made that mistake once or twice:). 
And if you’re bored, if the busses are running - you can take that to go see the Big Bear ski area.   

Most ski areas will sell you a ticket to go to the top of the mountain without skis or a board, just to look around or to go to the restaurant up there - not sure that’s open at the moment and I’m not sure they do that at Snow Summit.  But it’s something else to do at a ski area.

"Yo. The beauty about BigBear is you do not have to drive anywhere to see the stars. The sky is crystal clear at night because we do not have light pollution. As for fun things to do, there is the off road experience which I always have a good time doing. I love barrel 33 for drinks, but I can’t recommend any spas because I’ve never been to any up here. But we do have a nine hole golf course, so the guys can go golfing while the girls go get a massage. It’s always fun to rent a pontoon boat and cruise the lake or take a boat tour on the lake which is cheaper and you don’t have to worry about driving it.  Another nice thing to do is to ride the ski lift at snow summit up to the top. There is a little food hut up top where you can get burgers or hotdogs and enjoy the view. There’s also a bunch of little hiking trails up there if you feel inclined to do them. And hopefully, this summer, music in the mountains will return.

As to just like character or vibe of the mountain, I love the accessible nature and slower pace, but would jump at the chance for some cool arts or counterculture. I'm a nerd/writer/reader guy so it'd be neat to feel plugged into some kinda of scene that reflects that. Then again, it's hard to get out and do anything so it all kind of works out!

I do miss my city eats and whatnot, but I figure I was the one who I came up here so expected to meet the locals by their standard, even if it wasn't how I'd shape things. Pizza-wise, No Name Pizza I like out of all the places, and the stories are true about the Himalayan restaurant being good. Also like Dynasty and Fuji.

But cons have been the lonely feeling of being a little out of step with what appears to be the predominant culture. I probably just haven't found my people yet - have had nice chats with the library folk and the nature center attendants and the cashiers up here. That said, the Halloween recommend from this subreddit was a highlight of my time here.

"Bring chains and know how to use them (but you won’t need them. No snow in forecast for rest of month). You don’t need to be there that early on a weekday, that’s only weekends. I go at 8:30 on weekdays and pull right up into main lot no problem. If you want to be insanely cautious just in case then pre reserve your equipment/lift tickets. I’d recommend getting equipment off resort at Goldsmiths or Skihaus it’s cheaper than resort. Yes Bear has more beginner runs. Don’t forget water while on slope. I use a hydration pack but you’d be surprised how easily you’ll get dehydrated (you’re basically working out all day). Bear has shuttles out front that run to snow summit that won’t be an issue even on a weekend. Just ask an employee where they’re picking up (usually in front of the steps right out front by Moonridge). Tuesday will be a great day to ski.

"Your plan sounds good.  
For mid week with no new snow you should be fine arriving by 8am.  
There will be no problem with equipment rental availability no matter when you arrive.  
I am partial to Snow Summit but, if it is your first time it really won't matter,  you will only be on a few runs at either resort.   I would not bother trying to switch mountains.  Just focus on getting some runs in and improving your skills. Save the other resort for your next time. 
Chains are good but very high chance you will not need to put them on if coming up next week.  You will even be fine getting groceries here , if needed.  That is really only a concern during holidays when huge families want to throw huge meals.  I only go shopping midweek and last time I was in Vons there was plenty of food and no lines.
I would recommend skiing on Tuesday.   When you get up on Monday you can sightsee a bit and then should go to the resort before closing on Monday and get your tickets and rentals all set up.   That way Tuesday morning is just about arriving and getting on the snow,  no stress.

"Yeah, we just got back from MLK weekend. Smart to skip that weekend. It was packed, but we rented a place a mile away and my wife doesn't ski so we did drop off and pick-up and didn't deal with parking/shuttles. Saw incredibly long shuttle lines, and my son tried to shuttle back to Moonridge at day end from Bear and after 30+ minutes of standing in line, he was ""halfway to the front"", so I just hopped in the car and picked him up. We had zero problems with car drop-off other than getting stuck behind someone who didn't know what they were doing and thought they could just drive up to the front of the resort and park even though it was 9 AM, and made everyone going to drop off sit and wait while they talked to the lot attendant. This happened every. single. day. In fact, I had one dude in a giant truck almost hit me in his rush to get onto the main street to race to Bear, only to then partially pull into drop-off, stop, and clog the entrance AND block the street so he could have a long convo with the attendant.

Thus, drop-off is an option not discussed for if you're late to parking when it's busy - if you have someone who isn't participating but can drive, it's fantastic. Or, the people doing on-mountain rentals get dropped off so they can stand in line and get their rentals while the person with their own gear goes and parks and rides the shuttle. Nothing worse than having your own gear and waiting around for your friends or family that don't. :)  

As far as MLK weekend goes...

Day tickets were sold out both Saturday and Sunday (and no restrictions on Ikon pass holders). Lift lines weren't bad until about 10:30-11AM. Keep in mind, more people show up in the afternoon with afternoon tickets, so even though early people were leaving, more were arriving and lines didn't go away until near closing. Snow Summit was running night skiing and that was way busier than I expected, and we experienced one of the crazier things I've seen on a mountain: When it started getting dark, they shut down the upper right part of Snow Summit, where there are bunches of green runs. All those greenies chaired back up to the top to get out of the area, no other choice, and a ton of them ended up going down the park runs to get down, where they absolutely should not have been. This created some of the most congested and dangerous scenarios I've seen, with very experienced riders/skiers trying to carry speed to do the elements, and oblivious beginners just randomly falling down everywhere, running into each other, etc. Huge speed differentials between beginners and experts. Saw people sitting on ramps, (you know, just chilling??), crashed on landing zones and not urgently getting out of the way, and in piles in the narrow bypass lanes around the big jumps because some just can't make turns when the run squeezes to only 8 feet wide. My older son got P.O.'d at the mess and quit for the day. My younger son and I went to other parts of Snow Summit until the chaos subsided. It just stayed busy even at night! I wonder if a lot of it was everyone who couldn't get the sold-out day tickets decided that they would just wait around and do night session instead. By around 6:30 or so the lines were mostly gone but a different kind of alcohol fueled chaos started to set in, so we bailed. As we left, we still saw significant inflow of people walking up at 7pm.

Snow Report: Bear Mountain was icy on Saturday. Sunday was sunny and things softened up and got a bit heavy, slushy down low. Monday (MLK) the crowds were lighter and lines were much shorter. Day started sunny, snow was getting heavy by 10:30AM and then storm/clouds came in and it started raining.

"If you can figure out your boot size, range of bindings, and board size, there are lots of good deals online for equipment that will rapidly be cheaper than renting, especially if you can get ""last year's models"", but that seems harder these days due to everyone flocking to outdoor sports because of covid. Places like level9, the-house, etc. Or make some friends and get someone to sell you their used entry-level gear. :) You're too late this season for a Snow Jam or local store ski swap.. Remember, buying isn't the cost of the purchase, the cost is the difference between what you paid for it minus what you sell it for used. Since you're new to the sport, you don't need the bestest most amazingness hyper technology expensiveness..

Walking up and getting on a lift is huge compared to going through the rental office, particularly when it's crowded and you get on the lifts while the lift lines are short in the morning because of all the people waiting to park and waiting for rentals.

Also do yourself a favor and plan a trip later in the season to use your new skills and your Ikon pass at June Mtn or Mammoth (since you're a beginner, June is a better choice, IMO, but you can do both in the same trip).

"Well, ""they heard"" is usually a good jumping off point for hearsay. :)

I think if Target could turn a profit they'd be there. Just any like corporate business. But it comes down to numbers. I can't imagine they'd go in, considering the renovation that needs to be done, just for the local population. There's already two grocery stores and, supposedly, a third on the way. If it was just clothes and household goods, I'm not sure the numbers are there and I don't see visitors clothes shopping at Target. 

What I'm more concerned about is that complex in conjunction with all that  open land by Sandalwood. I don't know the status of it but it's not hard to imagine a developer trying to create a shopping destination for visitors. The drive up is a deterrent but who knows.
