"My wife and I were recently exposed and contracted COVID. We're vaccinated and boosted, so it wasn't any kind of severe infection. It *is* just like a bad cold (congestion, lethargy, chills, aches).

A cold that took us each over a week to kick. And longer to start testing negative on the rapid tests.

And you know what? It fucking sucks. We both had to take over a week off of work and deal with the stresses of self-quarantine.

Sure, nothing would have stopped us from going out and continuing to infect others, but there's a modicum of responsibility to sit tight and wait for the infection to run its course - which is what we did. On an individual level, it remains a significant disruption and a real pain in the ass to deal with - whether you've chosen to get a vaccine or not.

We will continue to wear masks in public - as we had been doing at the time of contracting it. But I encourage everyone to continue taking steps to remain healthy and do what can be done to limit exposure to yourselves and others.

""Eyre and Kaeding said Saskatchewan won't comply with Ottawa's plan to curb emissions or set more ambitious targets for the province, without seeing the data the federal government used to make decisions about caps on greenhouse gases.

""The biggest frustration we have in terms of the federal plans is the data sharing,"" Eyre said.

""They are using data about Saskatchewan that they don't show us … what they're imposing on us based on data collected in Ottawa about oil and gas sites they've never visited.""

Eyre and Kaeding said **there wasn't any ""meaningful"" consultation** between the provincial government and federal officials, besides a short phone call.

Vaccines have been proven to work, and they work the best when everyone, including those that won't directly be helped by them, get them. To speed up herd immunity. Those who avoid the vaccines for anything but a proven life-threatening reaction, could be thought of as responding emotionally, much like panic buying toilet paper.

 I'm 23 to be 24 later this year so I'm not the current ones suffering the pandemic in school but i can only imagine how horrible it would be for the current sufferers. 

Here's a little on why;

While i was in highschool I had 1 attempt on myself and was brushed aside and told nothing was wrong by the guy who evaluated me. Then 2 more attempts still during highschool years. I had hospitalized myself a few times. 

I still have strong tendencies I have 'lucked' if you can call it that, into not caving to the desires. I almost removed one of my fingers during a 4th and so far last event, damaged the tendon anyway.

- Absolutely some of these positions need to exist in school districts.  However, is it necessary for each school division to have its sub-calling system?

I have long advocated for an overhaul in education from the hiring process, funding (classrooms need way more money, especially in schools that struggle with poverty, food security, etc.), curriculum, classroom management to boundaries surrounding teachers (they are teachers, not parents, CCA's, social workers, etc).

"I suppose another possibility could be that since this subreddit is relatively small, its easier to notice when things are getting downvoted due to groupthink.

After a cursory glance at your profile (*I went peaking because I was curious which subreddits you post in*), I noticed you posted in r/antiwork. Now, personally, I would say r/antiwork is just as bad, if not worse, than r/saskatchewan in terms of being a circle jerk. However, since r/antiwork has something like over 200 times the number of active users than r/saskatchewan, the posts that go against the group are just so quickly downvoted and removed from the conversation entirely, since posts there regularly reach thousands of comments. So unless you sort by controversial, you wouldn't see the people getting downvoted for going against the grain.

 Whereas in this subreddit, its common for a popular post to have like, 12 comments. So if one of those 12 goes against the groupthink, its very evident and visible for everyone to see.

This isn’t a zero sum thing. It’s not all or nothing. It’s using common sense and technology to lessen our greenhouse gas output. We will never reach zero and that isn’t the goal. The goal is to get industry who are responsible for almost half of our emissions to adopt technology and research into reducing their output. It’s not controversial. We are living the consequences of doing nothing. We cannot afford multiple years of drought relief for farmers. Last year cost the taxpayers 2.1 billion for farmer drought relief.

Pretty standard for a modern Saskatchewan farming family (as in 2 parents and 3 kids) operation to handle 3000 to 4000 acres. Compare that to twenty years ago when equipment was smaller and that same land was farmed by 2 family operations.

Yeah, for some people it’s a cold. For me it was, I had an easy time with it *because I was vaccinated.* I’m grateful it was mild for me. Because it absolutely isn’t for some people.

For some people, this virus leaves so much lung damage once it’s through that they don’t know when or if they will have regular lung function again. 

And for some people, this virus replicates so fast it overwhelms their immune system and it kills them. Suffocates them as their lung function reduces so much that the lungs can’t transfer enough oxygen to the body to keep itself alive.

Just because “U” or I got the mild version doesn’t mean that everyone does. Everyone’s immune system is different and some people will have a drastically different COVID experience than a “cold.”

"I would add on to this to say that the number of different school divisions (27) in Saskatchewan contributes to this problem moreso because it creates redundancies.

Keeping things local, responsive, and community based is so important to education. I don’t think we need a few larger divisions.

people demonize union employees, but stability comes with it skill accumulation, and even fast food is skilled work. especially when trying to serve the maximum possible number of people in a small store.",t2_9iymb,Conqueror_of_Tubes,0,1648772538.0,0,t1_i2x5idi,i2x5idi,False,YALL_IGNANT,t3_tt4z7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/tt4z7q/chinook_school_division_says_it_will_cut_20/,Chinook School Division says it will cut 20 teaching positions due to shortfall in Sask. budget | CBC News,/r/saskatchewan/comments/tt4z7q/chinook_school_division_says_it_will_cut_20/i2x5idi/,1,r/saskatchewan,0,1

"From the investigation I have done, it looks like all Sask deaths are OF COVID. The way that we record cause of death in this province means that it is only described as a COVID death if the infection contributed to or caused death. Some provinces do it differently and then there is some ""with COVID"" overlap but that has more to do with them counting (for example) all elderly deaths within 30 days of having COVID as being COVID related deaths*. Whereas Sask doesn't do that and we are almost certainly undercounting (not overcounting) COVID-caused deaths. 

(Just as a logic-based aside, given how much our current provincial government likes to try and minimize the effects of COVID there is no way they wouldn't be trying to emphasize the split between OF and WITH COVID deaths if they could do so.)

"Ministry jobs have nothing to do with Chinooks budget. School boards receive money based on enrolment. The board and senior admin determine what that money is spent on. For Chinook to say they have to cut 20 teachers (in 2020, the board spent $345,104 on themselves), is misleading because they could choose to make cuts elsewhere. But, this way they get a headline. 

All that said, there is no question in my mind that the govt is actively defunding education AND are going to start making space for private and charter schools.",t2_7e47wpy5,braillean,0,1648752738.0,0,t1_i2vsuk6,i2vsuk6,False,YALL_IGNANT,t3_tt4z7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatchewan/comments/tt4z7q/chinook_school_division_says_it_will_cut_20/,Chinook School Division says it will cut 20 teaching positions due to shortfall in Sask. budget | CBC News,/r/saskatchewan/comments/tt4z7q/chinook_school_division_says_it_will_cut_20/i2vsuk6/,15,r/saskatchewan,0,15
"Care to elaborate? I work in education, and while I recognize there is some bloat in higher management, I can’t say that the non-teaching positions aren’t necessary.

Do you really expect divisions responsible for 7000 students and 30-40 facilities to not have in house maintenance, IT, accounting, payroll and other common corporate departments?
