"I'm glad to hear that more creative ideas are being discussed in Park City and we're (hopefully) not falling into the trap of relying on road widening and parking expansion.

I'm one of the people that voted for Main Street to be pedestrianized in the Reddit poll, and I think that's the single most important measure that will make Park City a more pleasant place - though I admit that living in Old Town gives me a strong bias for this over other projects.

Making a reversible middle lane on SR248 would be great. This is done at the Lion's Gate Bridge in Vancouver and the Golden Gate Bridge in SF and would be a way to move people in/out of town without significant construction. Making it one-way wouldn't work because that dumps all of the other-way traffic onto SR224 and significantly increases the distance traveled, and thus emissions.

I think congestion pricing would be great, with free access to vehicles registered in Summit County.

Really dislike the idea of accessing Park City via Guardsman Pass or Deer Crest. Guardsman would be super sketchy with a significant increase in traffic, and we've already got problems with trucks losing their brakes on Marsac. Plus that route would mean improving the entire length of BCC, making this very expensive, and also useless in the winter when Brighton and Solitude ski traffic is high. Deer Crest doesn't seem to do a lot of good, since it would be a parallel access to SR248 and would only get people to Deer Valley, but at least during the winter they can just take the Jordanelle gondola.",t2_n8do1,fred_the_plant,0,1648604520.0,0,t1_i2ntnyw,i2ntnyw,True,RepresentativeFromUT,t3_trtxao,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/trtxao/park_city_highlights_radical_transportation_ideas/,"Park City highlights radical transportation ideas like one-way S.R. 248, toll roads and pedestrian Main Street",/r/ParkCity/comments/trtxao/park_city_highlights_radical_transportation_ideas/i2ntnyw/,10,r/ParkCity,0,10

"I'm from the east coast and plan to buy Epic, primarily for PCMR.

Considering the cost of hotels that has gone completely crazy, the pass isn't the expensive part. The hotels I paid <$120for pre-pandemic are now easily >$300 a night. 

I still like the resort and terrain best, and am willing to give Vail a chance to actually hire groomers and lifties next year and keep more of the mountain open and groomed.  I've had a worse experience in late Feb this year than I had in mid-December two years ago just, and it's not just about snow quality - everything moguled and no regular grooming. The lift lines weren't the issue as much as the fact that everyone squeezed into a few runs. 

I considered IKON, but I don't like DV as much as PCMR. I can save money by staying in SLC and going up the canyons but I'm not keen on public transportation during Covid, and Alta/Snowbird are really beyond my skill level.

In a normal world with normal accountability, something like this is career-ending. But, I'm so cynical that I'm not confident in that anymore.

"tl;dr:

* A parent met with two school district employees in October 2019 to discuss the alleged abuse of the parent's child. ""The parent told the employees, identified in charging documents only as 'SDP#1' and 'SDP#2,' that SDP#1 had touched her child’s genitals. ... Those employees reported the allegation to an employee in the superintendent’s office, identified as 'SDP#3,' but none reported the allegation to law enforcement or child protective services, charging documents indicate.""

* ""This month [March 2022], another parent told police that their son had been raped by another student. Charging documents state a school district employee, identified as 'SDP#6,' heard about the alleged rape from a student and told the child’s parents afterward but did not tell proper authorities.""

* ""Law enforcement also learned that in December 2021, the Park City School District learned another student was accused of raping a female classmate.

">Here they are trying to put an end to STR's by overtaxing them and restricting them. So this is a workaround.

I definitely see the anti short term sentiment everywhere, but what exactly is the work around? 

Are you then offering it as a STR? Is there a limit to how much I can use it? Am I renting it when I use it? 

Or are you simply owning it and handling the carrying costs till X years later then selling it? If its this option I feel that's the worst way to do RE investing b/c it's 100% appreciation dependent and doesn't incorporate leverage, depreciation, rental income etc. Also, markets don't always go up.

> Pedestrianisation usually aims to provide better accessibility and mobility for pedestrians, to enhance the amount of shopping and other business activities in the area and/or to improve the attractiveness of the local environment in terms of aesthetics, air pollution, noise and crashes involving motor vehicle with pedestrians. However, pedestrianisation can sometimes lead to reductions in business activity, property devaluation, and displacement of economic activity to other areas. In some cases traffic in surrounding areas may increase, due to displacement, rather than substitution of car traffic.

Check out blueslip bowl off pioneer.  It gets easier as you go from skiers right to left.  Also if you dont like the way it looks you dont have to ski it and can stay on a groomer where when you go up to Jupiter/9990 there are no easy options for getting down.  So I would start on the skiers left and as your confidence grows you can drop in on skiers right where it is more steep.

"> It works as a hypothetical but not really in practice.

I'm genuinely curious to know what you mean by this. Is traffic in fact made worse or more dangerous when a person waits until the merge point before merging?

Merging early is in fact the one that works as a hypothetical but not really in practice. ""If everyone just agrees to merge as early as possible, it will be fair for everyone!"" Okay, that's a great hypothetical, but now traffic queues are backing up more than twice as long as they need to which compounds traffic issues behind, and everyone's drive is now slower and less fuel-efficient, and there's an opportunity for a pariah to ignore the rules and upset everyone by cutting them off, and some motorists are using the opportunity to act as a vigilante lane-blocker and purposely inflame the situation, and there's the possibility that we all end up merging early when the lane ahead isn't even closed anymore.

Those are some very real issues that emerge in practice, despite the wonderful harmony that's supposed to be achieved in theory.

In practice, the zipper merge may ""not work"" in the sense that the hivemind still *wants* to merge early and gets upset at the person merging properly, but the hivemind is still responsible for causing the issues above while the person merging properly is not.

> just merging when convenient.

To be clear, under freeflow traffic conditions, you are still supposed to merge whenever convenient. It's when traffic is congested that you are required to use both lanes. When traffic is congested, the whole point is that it's *not* convenient for someone to pick a random early spot and awkwardly try to squeeze in while backing up traffic behind them. The most convenient spot is the dedicated merge point, where you are legally entitled to the right of way.",t2_bglp3htq,RepresentativeFromUT,0,1646634847.0,0,t1_hzobcxx,hzobcxx,False,RepresentativeFromUT,t3_t87tft,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/t87tft/psa_the_zipper_merge_is_now_a_law_in_utah_if_your/,"PSA: The zipper merge is now a law in Utah!

"**So why is this important?**

Oftentimes, when motorists spot a merge ahead, they will try to be “polite” or “courteous” by merging ASAP, even though their lane is still clear ahead of them. **This is wrong.** Here are some things to consider:

* In heavy traffic, a long line of cars can back up into previous intersections or highway ramps, which is really, really bad. This is the main need for the zipper merge: it is much better to have two lanes of traffic backed up a quarter mile than to have one lane of traffic backed up a half mile, while the other lane sits unused. See e.g. [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBgjjnSoAWs&t=150s) (skip to 2:30) or [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzYbn3xtlXc), and realize that because all the traffic is taking up more *length* instead of more *width*, there can be extremely negative impacts on the road behind.

* Merging itself becomes more efficient using the zipper merge. When everyone agrees to merge at the same exact spot (at [the yellow sign](https://i.imgur.com/oUqVbMm.png) or when [the construction cones physically block the lane](https://i.imgur.com/kDj8yTQ.jpg)), the merge is more predictable and smooth for drivers, which vastly increases the capacity of the merge and speeds up the roads for everyone. When drivers merge at some random early point to be “polite,” the inpredictably and stop-and-go creates new traffic waves that wouldn’t exist if they had just merged at the universal spot.

* Everyone merging at the same spot is more fair for everyone. If you were the 50th person to arrive at the congested lanes, you’ll be the 50th person to merge. Without zipper merging, maybe you’ve become frustrated when you merged early to be “polite” and to “get in line,” and then you saw some “selfish” driver skip ahead in the empty lane. Perhaps you reflected on the fact that if *everyone* had simply used the empty lane, then *no one* would be selfish, because no one would be able to skip past anyone else.

* People’s tendency to merge early can sometimes be caused by seeing others merge, even when there is no lane closure ahead. For example, sometimes a crash will block a lane on a highway and slow down multiple lanes as they merge, and then the crash gets cleaned up and the lane reopens, but people are merging a mile ahead of time, so they don’t even realize that there is no need to merge anymore.",t2_bglp3htq,RepresentativeFromUT,1,1646599153.0,0,t1_hzmai4y,hzmai4y,True,RepresentativeFromUT,t3_t87tft,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/t87tft/psa_the_zipper_merge_is_now_a_law_in_utah_if_your/,"PSA: The zipper merge is now a law in Utah!

I’ve had a few harrowing encounters with both skiers and snowboarders, and while there are certainly some reckless and arrogant snowboarders, you guys are mostly fine; and it’s not like there aren’t reckless or arrogant skiers.

"There is no way to get there from the main lodge. You can get there from the Jordanelle gondola. If you are the base area and are a fnew skier and graduated beyond the bunny slope then I would recommend taking the Silver Lake Express and skiing down Trainer to the Quincy Express. This will take you to the top of Flagstaff Mountain. Start off with Ontario, it can get a bit busy but is very easy green. Take Quincy Express back up. Once you are good with that take Bluebell and stay on Lily and Lower Lily they are cat tracks that avoid the steep stuff. As you get better you can hop onto the lower part of Silver Buck. This will take you down to Silver Strike Express. Next you can give Bandana a try, it has one section with a bit of pitch but is very wide. At the bottom is the Montage and Empire Canyon Lodge, good spot for a snack or drink. Take the Ruby Express back up. At the end of the day take Ontario to Homeward Bound and jump on the Homestake Express and ski down Success, if you are feeling good there is a bit of a steeper section at the end - if not hop on Rosebud.

PC
- better powder, more BLUE cruisers
- Jupiter and McConkeys (PC) have best snow
- Treees below Jupiter (PC) also great
- Silverlode lift (PC) can be a bottleneck

Canyons
- AVOID tombstone and saddleback as day progresses
- more GREENS, more ungroomed BLUES
- Echo, super cóndor and Boa all fun BLUES
- Tunnel of Fun and Hurricaine Alley are two great ungroomed BLUES on The Canyons side. 
- The Drop, Pinball Alley, and Sidewinder are all very good introductory BLACKS in good conditions.
- The Pines and The Aspens (BLACKS) off saddleback express are great tree runs
- Murdock Bowl is a rewarding hike (sandwich day!!!)
- STH is a fun single black with some very unique hazards
- 9,990 is a solid expert area with some rather challenging terrain
- Deschutes, Grande, and The Abyss all offer some of the hardest lift-serviced tree terrain I’ve ever encountered",t2_1tftyolq,snatcheez,0,1645926305.0,0,t1_hyl9578,hyl9578,False,snatcheez,t3_t26atq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/t26atq/visiting_until_wednesday_looking_for_best/,Visiting until Wednesday — looking for best up-to-do/must-do things!,/r/ParkCity/comments/t26atq/visiting_until_wednesday_looking_for_best/hyl9578/,2,r/ParkCity,0,2

the main spots to aviod as the day progresses are tombstone and saddleback.  So get there early take a few rips on saddleback.  As that line builds head to tombstone.  If that line has not built up do a few rips there.  You now have an option to go to peak 5 or iron mtn.  peak 5 is slow but there are some blues and is generally empty.  Iron mountain has a few blues.  You can get to dreamscape/ dreamcatcher from both peak 5 and iron mtn now that they opened dreamscape.  You can entertain yourself for a while there as they are the last areas to get line buildup and they have lots of mellow blues.   Then later in the day scoot back to tombstone but dont take it (it will be crowded AF) take over and out and that will put u back at the base area and there should not be too bad of a line on OBX and you can hit up supercondor.  Unfortunately sunpeak has been closed all year.  I dont ski weekends so all bets are off for that.

"Had a similar experience at Canyons today.....we started at OBX around 9:30 (it was running) and got up to Saddleback by about 10:20. Surprisingly, no line at Saddleback at that time (but not for long). Agree that the conditions were a bit deceiving....looked like fresh snow but it was just a bit of powder over ice. I normally don't have issues with hands/feet getting cold but today was different. We called it after about two hours. Also-- we normally ski home on Retreat....it has been a mess...brown dirt and hardly a way down. Sometimes it's open, sometimes it's roped off with no rhyme or reason. Given that this run serves several resort properties, I can't understand why it's not more of a priority to Vail and PCMR. It looks like they're set up to make snow there, so why don't they? If I was paying top dollar for a ski-in ski-out accommodation and showed up to find out it was neither, I'd be pretty peeved.",t2_lehe8qs,jb2225150,0,1645669452.0,0,t1_hy6ozer,hy6ozer,True,mr_engin33r,t3_szrc4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/szrc4k/conditions_today_bit_of_a_rant/,Conditions today (bit of a rant),/r/ParkCity/comments/szrc4k/conditions_today_bit_of_a_rant/hy6ozer/,2,r/ParkCity,0,2

"I've experienced this numerous times, mostly in the weight room. 

BASIN used to be decent, but the huge numbers of high schools who congregate there now have sort of ruined it for us. They clog up the weight room area and seem to rove in packs like dogs, without really ever actually doing much in the way of a workout. 

I don't understand why the kids can't work out at PCHS. There is no way that all of these kids go to school elsewhere, either, because most of them are donning PCHS attire.

The meathead factor among adult men is certainly prevalent at BASIN, too. Even two of their ""trainers"" are this way. One of them is clearly on steroids and obsessed about being a ""bodybuilder"" of some sort.

Frankly, I wish that BASIN would charge more and have ""adult only"" hours from something like 5-7PM every weekday. The kids can come after school or later.

"I appreciate your frequent posting and especially your commentary, so I do hope you keep it up.

I agree with you that additional parking only leads to additional traffic, and that a lack of parking forces people to change their behavior. Sundance is a perfect example of this, where everyone knows driving and parking in Old Town is a disaster, so they plan accordingly. It seems that many locals feel entitled to priority access to this town's amenities (which I can't really argue with) but the town doesn't prioritize local's access. We could always implement congestion charging like what London does, but I feel that would also upset a lot of people. I'm somewhat immune to all of this living in Old Town and not needing to deal with the daily traffic disasters around Park City, but on the days that I venture out I can understand where peoples' frustrations come from.

Before reading the editorial, the headline alone caught my attention as a potential way for the City to tell Vail Resorts that it needs to deliver a better skiing product with the resources it has (e.g.: opening up all the chairs, hiring more people, etc.) before the City will allow it to expand operations even more.

Thb, There is no great public transport route to PC.  It's 1.5 hours minimum, based on Google maps estimates.

"I'd like to start this one by stating that I'm open to feedback regarding my posting to r/ParkCity. If I'm posting too many articles, let me know. If I should continue to post news from Park Record, KPCW, and Park Rag but tone down my own editorializing, let me know.

This opinion piece is pretty standard and doesn't add much new stuff to the conversation, but I think it's important to keep an eye on what the community is saying regardless. I think this one highlights how important it is to have public outreach from the City not only on specific proposals (such as the PCMR base project or the Arts & Culture District), but on the City's broader goals and how they approach development proposals.

If this person is worried about the impact of the PCMR base project, then it is unsurprising to me that they would worry over the developer's lack of conformance to the Land Management Code (LMC). When the City talks about granting exceptions to the LMC, they need to know who their audience is: ordinary people who are wondering why the fat-cat developers are allowed to come in and maximize profit at the expense of the character of a community, LMC be damned.

I don't blame the author for criticizing the City and the process, even though I think she's not keeping her eye on the ball. She first claims that the PCMR base project won't provide enough value to the community, and then supports her argument by citing the example of parking. As far as I can tell, her line of thinking on that example (which is all too familiar) is: ""if the PCMR base project is really to benefit the community, then the developer should be forced to build 1,023 new parking spaces at the base like the LMC requires, instead of [requesting to build only 521 new parking spaces](https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/pxk55s/guest_opinion_community_will_live_with_impact_of/heu4elf/)."" If an ordinary resident thinks that what's best for the community is to enforce parking minimums, they're shooting themselves in the foot and will inevitably complain in two years as even more tourists drive in with even more cars to take up even more parking spots.

Obviously I've continued to make that case very publicly here on reddit, but I do think the City is to blame a bit for not doing enough to explain to residents what's going on. I wish that ordinary planners had the opportunity to explain to ordinary residents that **the LMC, as written, is not on the side of ordinary residents**. The best thing for the community is to have a planning commission which advocates for good planning, NOT what's simply already written in the LMC. There's a big disconnect there, and I think it needs to be addressed so the City and the residents don't keep talking past each other like this.",t2_bglp3htq,RepresentativeFromUT,0,1644366937.0,0,t1_hw5q6kj,hw5q6kj,True,RepresentativeFromUT,t3_snz83n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/snz83n/guest_opinion_city_should_set_a_new_precedent_and/,Guest opinion: City should set a new precedent and deny PCMR base area project,/r/ParkCity/comments/snz83n/guest_opinion_city_should_set_a_new_precedent_and/hw5q6kj/,8,r/ParkCity,0,8

You'll struggle to find parking so you'll have to bus in and on a Saturday it'll practically be skied out by the time you touch a slope. If you're somehow on the snow by 11:30 you'll get a couple of runs in and mostly wait in shitshow lines. 

Try to get there by 8:30 or earlier for good parking and early lifts. If you get to the back of the mountain early you can get A LOT of good runs in on good snow before it gets busy.

The drive isn't bad, 4 lanes the whole way. We had some delays about half of the days but the big thing to remember is this is huge money for Utah, they will keep these roads flowing to ski resorts.

What part of my statement is not true?  Medical weed is legal in Utah - fact - but its distribution is tightly controlled and limited to 14 dispensary locations - fact.  A small handful of healthcare professionals authorized to give medical marijuana licenses - fact.

"> we used to have a great, reliable bus system

Are you suggesting that more people were riding the former Park City Transit 6 Lime, 7 Pink, and 8 Brown lines than are currently riding the Park City Transit 10 White and High Valley Transit 101 Spiro lines?

I certainly admit that the micro-transit is interesting and perhaps unproven (and Via's staffing issues aren't doing us any favors). But, while I admit I haven't seen the data, I would speculate that the express service now seen on these new lines (10 White and 101 Spiro) sees more ridership because it's actually *better* adapted to our needs—that is, providing more mobility between major destinations, at the expense of one-seat local access to areas like Silver Creek, Trailside, and Pinebrook.

I'm certainly open to changing that view if the data suggest otherwise, but my impression is that the increasing traffic has simply been a reflection of the growth that outdoor recreation has seen as an industry, as well as the economic success and growth of the Wasatch Front. (Both of these factors were present before Covid, and were accelerated by it.) It's not that our buses are *worse*; it's that our buses *can't keep up with the growth* even though the buses are genuinely improving.

> I feel like if 248 was expanded into a 2 lane road, it would help with a lot of traffic exiting the city around rush hour

I think u/NoAbbreviations290 did a great job of capturing the state of things on this one. PC residents seem to have been pretty schizophrenic on this one, and I admit I was torn on it as well. While I certainly supported adding an outbound lane to help shovel traffic out of the urban core and towards the highways that can handle the capacity, I always was (and still am) pretty undecided on whether an inbound lane is what we need.

If the cars weren't jamming up the westbound merge at Richardson Flat Road in the morning, then they'd be jamming up the 248–Bonanza intersection and the 248–224 intersection. No one likes sitting in traffic, but the reality is that keeping the traffic ""out there"" where there's nothing but road perhaps makes sense compared to inviting those cars directly into the urban core as quickly as possible, only to cause gridlock in the city itself.

In summary, is the 248 merge into one lane a troublesome ""bottleneck"" which slows everyone's commute, or is it in fact a useful ""filter"" which keeps the infrastructure further west from breaking down? That's something that's been on my mind for years, but I admit I never read the alternative study nor EIS published by UDOT. In any case, that's all behind us now, and UDOT probably won't be touching that road for another decade or two, until their memories fade of all the incessant whining they had to deal with from our community during that 2018–2021 project.",t2_bglp3htq,RepresentativeFromUT,0,1644288638.0,0,t1_hw1665q,hw1665q,False,RepresentativeFromUT,t3_smgn55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/smgn55/park_record_guest_columnist_tom_clyde_says_that/,Park Record guest columnist Tom Clyde says that PCMR traffic overwhelms streets (but adding more parking should fix the problem),/r/ParkCity/comments/smgn55/park_record_guest_columnist_tom_clyde_says_that/hw1665q/,3,r/ParkCity,0,3

"> Why not build parking in Snyderville and built light rail that goes into Canyons and Park City?

There are certainly plans to build more parking outside the city, and there are certainly plans to improve transit. The issues are those of politics, funding, and (to an extent) geography.

An issue that has proven tricky has been convenient access to park and ride facilities. The largest lots are Richardson Flat and Ecker Hill—both hilariously far enough out of the way to give car-entitled boomers plenty of political ammo. And without any sort of aggressive plan to disincentivize driving into the city, why would anyone bother? It makes way more sense to clog the streets and save yourself 20 minutes. If your transit plan relies on the altruism of ordinary people, then it’s game over.

Most recently (November 2021) regarding transit, US Rep Blake Moore’s push to earmark $6 million in the infrastructure bill for a Bus Rapid Transit line in Summit County fell short. They still want to build it in the next ~5 years, but need to find the funding somewhere.

To directly address light rail—it won’t happen. Utah has decided that Bus Rapid Transit is the future because the capital costs are cheaper, thus making it more politically expedient. The city and county will build gondolas before they build rail.",t2_bglp3htq,RepresentativeFromUT,0,1644256496.0,0,t1_hvyzf3j,hvyzf3j,False,RepresentativeFromUT,t3_smgn55,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParkCity/comments/smgn55/park_record_guest_columnist_tom_clyde_says_that/,Park Record guest columnist Tom Clyde says that PCMR traffic overwhelms streets (but adding more parking should fix the problem),/r/ParkCity/comments/smgn55/park_record_guest_columnist_tom_clyde_says_that/hvyzf3j/,2,r/ParkCity,0,2
