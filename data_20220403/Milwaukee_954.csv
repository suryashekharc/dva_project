"Rating:  4/10 (site-specific comments pertain mainly to Glendale location, shown in picture above)

Positives:  frozen custard, onion rings and chicken sandwiches are excellent

Negatives:  Long time Koop’s customer (I used to go to the original location on Appleton Ave.), but no more.  Meat now has no taste (they switched to a new, cheaper distributor about two years ago); cheeseburgers have less cheese than they used to; new buns suck and are very dry; hot fudge sundaes have less fudge and have a surcharge; malts now have liquid malt rather than the previous higher quality powder form; wait for food is ridiculous; I am disabled and customers constantly park illegally in designated spaces; fries are a disaster and mushy; if you order just a sundae or a drink, for example, you go to the end of the queue behind everyone with full food orders, typically more than 20 minutes during busy times; online ordering seldom works, the pick-up line is squeezed into a small space at the counter and the person filling the order has to first interrupt a cashier or log onto a separate register to verify that you paid; employees work hard, but seem miserable - you will never hear a ‘thank you’ for your order or for choosing Kopp’s from the front-line employees, for example; parking is a zoo, spaces are too small and many people park at the neighboring La Quinta hotel, FedEx office or even on the street to avoid it; rear parking lot is poorly lit and unsafe; new customers must have a hard time figuring out the ordering system.  My wife and I previously have gotten stomach aches and bowel evacuations the last few times we visited and have not eaten there since.  I spoke to two on-duty managers on separate occasions about some of my concerns and they each were huge a**holes both times.  Most managers are not friendly or ever smile - for heaven’s sake who can be constantly pissed off dispensing ice cream?  I would guess many of these glowing reviews are from people who have not even been to Kopp’s very recently.

There's a huge schism happening here between wealthy white liberals and poor non-white progressives, who use the Democrat label to pretend they're on the same team and have the same goals. Dr. Sheldon Wasserman and Eric Rorholm have drastically different goals from each other for the 3rd Aldermanic district, as does my buddy Juan Miguel Martinez, who is running for MKE school board in the MPS 10th district.

"My entire dad's side of the family is from Cudahy, and I have spent much of my life there. I agree that Cudahy needs work. The downtown and school district could use some revitalization and the the local economy is not booming. However, there is immense potential. The house prices are, as mentioned many times, very good. New generations are moving into Cudahy. The taxes are not high. Cudahy offers a nice, suburban environment within close proximity to downtown. But the economy still needs work, and the city cannot support a complete revitalization without fixing that problem. Cudahy has a higher poverty rate than the state and trails both federally and statewide in income. The unemployment rate is higher than the state's average. 

To summarize, Cudahy needs a continued injection of new workers and families. This most likely will happen because of the good housing prices.

"Well, the subject line is about whitewashing Mr. Johnsons opponent, so I thought it would be appropriate to point out that this appears to be occurring with Mr. Johnson with the help of the largest newspaper (and other media) in the city / state.  This is recent news, not something that did or did not occur 20+ years ago.  

The crime Mr. Johnsons brother committed occurred in  January and he was just apprehended recently.  Do you think that if Mr. Johnsons name was associated with the brother, perhaps he would have been apprehended sooner?

Mr. Johnson is claiming that he is too busy campaigning to be troubled with any public safety plans.  The MPD reports to the mayor and I believe everyone can agree that crime in the city is out of control.  The #1 priority of any Mayor should be public safety for all residents.

"> Seattle has a lot more political/popular momentum for biking than Milwaukee

That doesn't bode well for Milwaukee if true. 

In one of the latest Seattle city council elections one of the candidates won on a NIMBY platform of fighting against a city proposed bike lane on 35th Ave NE because some of the businesses on that street didn't want to lose any street parking and some of the residents of that neighborhood went so far as to launch a petition to fight against the bike lane saying it would inconvenience their driving too much. I suppose support may come in waves but having lived and ridden in both SEA and PDX now I'd say SEA has a long way to go before it can be considered as bike friendly as PDX.

I'm not sure if this is factored into the posted vertical clearance or if that's just the height directly under the bridge.
