"Good advice already in the buying side.

I like this inspector:  
[https://www.inspector7.com/](https://www.inspector7.com/)

John really digs in and finds a bunch of stuff, and delivers a really nice thick report.  Not the cheapest, or the fastest, but he's really digging in.

&#x200B;

I grew up fixing up old houses with my dad, and I am on my second fixer upper, that is almost done.  It's also gone from $235k to $500k after dumping $125k and a HUGE amount of hours in it, over about 5 LONG years.  It's also paid off, which is nice.

My advice on a fixer upper, is be very careful with this.  Living in a home you are remodeling is a very effective way to ruin a relationship, and make yourself miserable.  You could also be using this time for building your career with training, networking, and whatnot.

It's also a good way to build equity and get a nice home you could not otherwise afford.

&#x200B;

If you go this route DEFINETLY get someone like John to inspect, and seek out the SMELLY houses.   As long as it's not mold, and sometimes when it is, smell's are very easy to take care of doing stuff you would already do, like clean, paint, and replace flooring.",t2_9u4ec,shinypointysticks,0,1649009947.0,0,t1_i392tfk,i392tfk,True,KingPhantom3,t3_tv9b5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tv9b5k/any_advice_for_a_prospective_first_time_homeowner/,Any advice for a prospective first time homeowner in today's market?,/r/Minneapolis/comments/tv9b5k/any_advice_for_a_prospective_first_time_homeowner/i392tfk/,1,r/Minneapolis,0,1

"Seconding OP's comment on breakfast burritos. I lived in New Mexico for a few years and every half a mile there was a place where you could get a cheap (I'm talking like $3-5), quality breakfast burrito to go at any time of day - sometimes you'd even find great, handmade burritos at rural gas stations. Haven't found anything quite like it since moving back. 

I'd love to see a subway system in Mpls, or a more comprehensive light rail system, or at very least, buses that ran frequently enough you wouldn't have to check the schedules and worry about missing your ride (especially at night). It would be good to see a transit system that would be more usable for going to events, bar hopping (especially), just going to a friend's house or whatever - unlike the current system that seems more geared toward commuting.

Not Minneapolis specific, but I wish the twin cities had closer access to large, contiguous protected/natural areas (large as in 50k+ acres - someplace you can keep going back to and finding new spots way in the backcountry). Not that we do too bad in terms of access to green space - and of course the north shore is an easy weekend trip - but there's something to be said about being able to get up in the morning, spend all day in a semi-wilderness area and be home for dinner, the way you could from Duluth but also Denver, Phoenix, Seattle - hell, even Washington DC and other big cities near the AT.

"I worked on Broadway and spent plenty of time in Midtown Manhattan, especially around the Bus Terminal because I was commuting in from Passaic every day.

My point is this; if you're talking *specifically about Marquette and the bus/light rail terminal there* you should be comparing it to the Port Authority Bus Terminal.

There aren't nearly as many food carts (fuck I miss Halal Brothers - that chicken though) but there's just as much, if not more, green space that's easily accessible.

That's my point and that's all.  And that was the question: does downtown have about as much accessible green space as Midtown Manhattan?

The answer for that, when comparing Apples to Apples, is that the area around Marquette has just as much green space as the area around the Port Authority Bus Terminal on 8th.  Sure you can cut into Hell's Kitchen and find some random little corners with a bit of grass and trees lining the avenue, but you're not going to find food carts there.  Duck into a deli, sure, you can maybe grab a counter spot if they have it and it's open, but no; if you're comparing apples to apples, and your example is Marq and 5th, you should be using the area around the Port Authority Bus Terminal as the counter-example.  When you compare those areas and the area around them, Minneapolis wins out easily.

That's all.",t2_4nmok,warfrogs,0,1648999241.0,0,t1_i38cyji,i38cyji,False,Godhelpthisoldman,t3_tuwc4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tuwc4d/what_do_you_wish_minneapolis_had_but_doesnt/,"What do you wish Minneapolis had, but doesn't?",/r/Minneapolis/comments/tuwc4d/what_do_you_wish_minneapolis_had_but_doesnt/i38cyji/,1,r/Minneapolis,0,1

"Not OP but I love collecting tapes. They're a lot less sought after than vinyl, so you can still find great deals at thrift shops, yard sales, antique shops, used record stores. 

A lot of what is available in the wild comes from a nostalgic time for me personally.

Physical media is fun! You still get artwork and lyric sheets like vinyl, but in a portable format. They are easy to store, fun to trade, and an affordable way to support artists that put them out.

Totally subjective here, but I prefer tapes over CDs as a format because the surface of discs are easily damaged, and the sound of a broken-in tape sounds more comforting than a skipping disc.",t2_2ml628eu,JohnsonSmithDoe,0,1648999123.0,0,t1_i38cor6,i38cor6,False,BanjoDude222,t3_tugk45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tugk45/in_town_for_one_night_which_record_store_should_i/,in town for one night. which record store should I visit if I am looking for cassette tapes?,/r/Minneapolis/comments/tugk45/in_town_for_one_night_which_record_store_should_i/i38cor6/,1,r/Minneapolis,0,1

"Fun story: I’ve known Tim League (founder and longtime CEO of the Drafthouse) for twenty years. He was up here for meetings with his COO back around 2016 and I took him around to show him places I thought would be great for a theater. They were most excited about the former Midway Center redevelopment around the soccer stadium (they loved that it was on the light rail and BRT as well as on the 94 exit between both downtowns) and the old Dayton’s/Macy’s in DT St Paul (the new one in LA which they were building at the time is in a former Macy’s). They were aghast that St Paul only had two movie theaters with a total of four screens, and that most folks have to go to the suburbs to see anything.

The owner of the outdoor mall (er…”lifestyle center”) that the eventual location is in likely gave them a sweetheart deal because they wanted more people to visit the mall area and the stores and restaurants that are there.

Also, it’s a franchise location, not a company-owned one.

"I took advantage of a couple first time home buyer programs for down payment and closing cost assistance. I got a forgivable loan and two grants, and between them my closing costs and down payment were mostly covered. I think out of pocket, I paid about $1000 towards inspection and other small costs in the process. 

Because of rising rates, there aren’t as many “bidding wars” or people going wildly over asking this year. You need to find a good realtor who is great with first time buyers who can be honest but not hyperbolic about the market. And a loan officer who is good with helping you figure out how much you can afford and how to get there. 

I bought a home last year when the market was a lot more competitive than it is now. I didn’t have to pay wildly over asking and wasn’t outbid on 20 homes. It’s a lot of work to buy a home in any market, but it’s entirely possible to find a great home without the insanity.

"A democraticly elected charter committee. 

A mayor that doesn't take donations from the police union. 

A new contract with the police union that doesn't give them all the leverage. This is because there's currently a clause in their contract that says the old contract continues until the police union agrees to a new one, hence the need to change the charter, which Minneapolis just stupidly voted against. 

More rotation of city council members. 

An ecosystem where we could have more 24hr gas stations/restaurants.

A movie theater, now that the St. Anthony is no longer doing mainstream stuff.

More development into transportation, but I don't know what to specify here. I only have a dumb awareness of transportation, where I want ""more"", and ""better"", though I think they do a good job right now.

Teachers to make more then currently, where they make 90% of what every other teacher makes in the cities around us. (Not sure how well the strike went)

"Get prequalified before you start looking. 

There are down payment assistance programs thru [the state](https://www.mnhousing.gov/sites/Satellite?c=Page&cid=1519058662552&d=Touch&pagename=External%2FPage%2FEXTStandardLayout), [the city](https://www2.minneapolismn.gov/government/programs-initiatives/housing-development-assistance/home-ownership/minneapolis-homes/homebuyer-resources/), and thru private lenders like Bank of America. However, using a down payment assistance program may make it harder to get an accord accepted. 

If you have bad to fair credit, a mortgage broker is the better choice. They will apply for mortgages from multiple sources for you, but the rates likely won’t be as competitive as working directly a private lender can offer. 

If you don’t mind living in sticks and commuting to Mpls, you can use the [USDA mortgage program](https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do) to get a home with no $$ down. My friend closed on her house in Braham with about $1K total to her name. 

Don’t sign an exclusivity contract with a realtor. We had good and bad experiences with different realtors. You want to be able to leave if your realtor isn’t putting in the work for you. 

Be prepared to have a LOT of offers rejected. We got a house on our 10th offer. We had an FHA loan with 5% down and we paid all closing costs ($22K out of pocket total). If you’re buying on the lower range and want to be competitive, you can agree to an inspection where you can’t negotiate for the seller to pay to fix issues uncovered, but you can still walk away if extremely expensive issues are found.

The faster you can close on a property the faster they get paid so don't think for a minute that when they tell you that, they have your best interests in mind.

The one we landed still had 15k worth of issues.  A family of racoons living in the chimney so removal fees then a new liner, drip ledge, and chimney caps.  Then the sewer inspection had a bulge in it.  We didn't pay for any of it.

You're going to spend more than you think.  It's going to be a fight.  You're going to make offer after offer that gets rejected.  Stick with it, you'll get one eventually.  Oh... and fuck all realtors for adding zero value and siphoning money from owners and buyers.

The problem with a small downpayment is the monthly payment is then unaffordably high. I had a short chat with a realtor from the St. Paul area and he said houses are selling for much more than they're listed because of fierce bidding wars.

"First Minnesota offers a first time homebuyers loan. Pretty similar to your mortgage process just with the state. 

Second don't spend all your savings on a down payment. Try to keep $5k to $10k in your pocket for unexpected expenses. Make a 5 year budget plan and stick to it. 

 Too many friends have used all of their savings just to get a house only to find a major expense looming a few months into ownership. Tanking their 5 year financial plan. 

Third do not and I repeat do not turn down an inspection. They will show you the details of your home that you need to know, they also will help you know of any problems in the foreseeable future. Think 3 to 5 year projects you will know you need to save up for. 

Four it's your time vs your interest in the home vs the market. What I mean is play the long game, don't rush into buying because it's an easy solution. Find the right home, location and then see if it can fit your budget. 

Five research, research, research.  what styles of home do you love, where in the twin cities do those homes exist? My wife and I wanted a rambler in South Minneapolis, this is super rare but as soon as we changed our location we found tons of them around St Paul.

My wife and I ended up taking almost 2 years seeing nearly 65 houses, 30 with our realtor, bid on 6 and won out by being consistent with our terms.

Former Minnesotan that relocated to New Jersey 5 years ago. You are spot on. The most glaring difference between the east coast and Minnesota is the concept of a neighborhood. Neighborhoods aren’t just rows and rows of houses with a gas station/grocery store nearby. It’s a whole community of conveniences and culture all within walking distance. Everything I could ever need is within 3 miles of where I currently reside. I know the owners of the restaurants around me. I chat up the local grocery store clerk who’s kid goes to the same school as mine.

"I’m newer to the area so that’ll definitely influence my choices more.

Better public transport, was to much reliance on cars, most buses that go further then just the twin cities only run on a “business schedule” into the city in the morning out at night. Made it extremely difficult getting to my job in the morning from downtown some days would’ve been multiple transfers and an extra hour time for a 20 minute drive.

More options for seafood, and affordability in that regard, coastal seafoods is a god send but prices on even some basic stuff where double what I use to pay on the east coast. And I absolutely don’t blame the business getting a fresh fish supply out here is no easy task I’d imagine.

"An urban growth boundary. 

Sprawl is the enemy. If there's no reason to not build more housing further out, then that's what we do. 

However...

A spread out population requires cars. 

A spread out population can only support a limited number of local businesses. 

A spread out population forces agriculture further from the city. 

Forced density concentrates population, making it easier for niche businesses to survive.

Enough people living within range to support 5 Korean restaurants, 5 sushi restaurants., and 5 ramen restaurants.

How I understand it, the original comment was talking specifically about the food trucks on Marquette not having an immediate spot to eat their food. 

Any place in NYC that sells street food that can’t be eaten while you walk, (pizza, bagels, glizzies, for example) has a spot for people to sit literally steps away. There is always a stoop, a wall or steps to sit. I’ve seen people sit on cars to eat. You make do with what’s around you. No need to walk a block or blocks to find a spot.

So since these projects inexplicably take decades in America it’s being tunneled through swamps to nowhere instead.,t2_hc7pi8j7,Designer_Suspect2616,0,1648963510.0,0,t1_i36vldo,i36vldo,False,Godhelpthisoldman,t3_tuwc4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tuwc4d/what_do_you_wish_minneapolis_had_but_doesnt/,"What do you wish Minneapolis had, but doesn't?",/r/Minneapolis/comments/tuwc4d/what_do_you_wish_minneapolis_had_but_doesnt/i36vldo/,12,r/Minneapolis,0,12

"Couldn’t agree more. Although from what I recall, the city isn’t necessarily to blame - I could be talking out my ass here but I remember being told that expansion of the light rail out to even just the west suburbs (Hopkins, St. Louis Park, Minnetonka, Wayzata, etc.) has been torpedoed multiple times in the last few decades by the residents of the suburbs themselves. Reason being, the affluent, law-abiding citizens (read: whitey) who chair the city council of, say, Wayzata, essentially have detested the thought of “urban crime/criminals” (read: not whitey) having a direct line of transit to their community.

"Depends on what you mean by adequate. I sold my car after moving here. I bike more than I use transit, even during winter. I'd use transit more if my bus was reliable and/or (actually) reasonably frequent.

I leave 2 hours early to get to work if I'm taking the bus just to be sure I'm not late. I've never made it home from work in under an hour. The bike ride takes 10 minutes on a bad day, and I actually follow traffic laws when riding my bike.

I use 3 apps to track where they are, including the official one.

"100%. We call ourselves land of 10000 lakes. But many of our lakes and waterfronts are not super accessible to the public. And if they are, it’s probably a park with maybe a picnic shelter and boat landing, maybe public toilets if you’re lucky.

Other major cities in the midwest do a much better job of utilizing their waterfront space and making it more publicly accessible in ways other than parks and boat landings. We do not. Instead we have private single family homes on many of our lakes in this area. It’s a shame. Restaurants and bars etc are at least semi-accessible to the public and they are destination spots for tourists. They go a long way to a modern city having character. 

If y’all try to argue this, you’ve clearly never left the twin cities for any extended period of time. Even Duluth does a better job and they are sitting on a goldmine of under-utilized potential.

"Sure but the example given is NYC in comparison. And I kind of disagree with the St. Paul example because again, no one seems to understand that distance is a real thing. 

Yes rice park is central in downtown St. Paul because downtown St. Paul is tiny. Rice park is damn near the only park St. Paul even has.

The commons and the government center are central downtown Minneapolis. Otherwise there is Loring, the riverfront, and others as stated. There’s peavey plaza, theres the convention center plaza, loring park greenway, Nicollet mall itself is now pedestrian only, etc

Even Portland I don’t think is much better than Minneapolis purely based on maps, the downtown again looks bigger than Minneapolis with a large commercial area with no green space on a map. And the city of Portland is nearly 3x the size area wise as Minneapolis.

There are green spaces “every few blocks” in downtown Minneapolis because it’s literally like a 10 sq block area lol

Do people expect a brand new park right on Hennepin or something? There are literally like 5+ parks within blocks from central downtown. It absolutely is a “commercial hub” and it’s not surprising there’s like a 3 block radius without any parks. And yeah I think it’s disingenuous to say there aren’t little peaceful spots tucked away even in the very most developed part of downtown. People aren’t paying attention basically.

Downtown Minneapolis is multitudes more pleasant than downtown St. Paul from a greenery perspective. Way more trees, way more benches, way more parks.

"Marquette is right by the government center plaza and a couple blocks from the loring greenway and the commons… 

Nyc does not have green spaces closer than that and not everyone in downtown works on Marquette and not everyone in Manhattan works right next to a green space…

Sure nyc does have little green spaces but it’s pretty similar to what I just mentioned in a 5 block radius, and generally worse. I’ve been to Manhattan several times, and if you even look at a map even it’s a 2000ft scale for a similar amount of spots vs 1000ft in downtown Minneapolis. There even are food trucks at the commons. Could it be better?

"For how small downtown Minneapolis is compared to “NYC” I don’t think it’s actually that bad in this regard. There’s the government center plaza/park, the commons, Elliot park, loring park, and the entire riverfront all within walking distance of anywhere in downtown or a 5-10 min bus ride or a very quick bike ride.

And when you expand to Minneapolis proper we have NYC beat easily. Minneapolis proper is smaller than Brooklyn by itself and roughly 2x the size of just Manhattan. Downtown Minneapolis is like 1/20th the size of Manhattan, if that.

Like Manhattan is a massive concrete jungle and walking to a green space would generally take you as long or longer than doing so in downtown Minneapolis. And yeah if you can’t walk 5 blocks without complaining I don’t think you’d like NYC very much lol. You end up walking there more than pretty much any other American city lol. And yeah Minneapolis has plenty of ways to avoid that 5 block walk pretty easily and if you have a car the traffic and parking is a complete non-issue in comparison.

"Perfect Chocolate Chip Cookies  
Servings: 16 cookies  
  
1 ¾ cups unbleached all-purpose flour (8 3/4 ounces)  
½ teaspoon baking soda  
14 tablespoons unsalted butter (1 3/4 sticks)  
½ cup granulated sugar (3 1/2 ounces)  
¾ cups packed dark brown sugar (5 1/4 ounces) (see note)  
1 teaspoon table salt  
2 teaspoons vanilla extract  
1 large egg  
1 large egg yolk  
1 ¼ cups semisweet chocolate chips or chunks (see note)  
¾ cup chopped pecans or walnuts, toasted (optional)  
  
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Line 2 large (18- by 12-inch) baking sheets with parchment paper. Whisk flour and baking soda together in medium bowl; set aside.  
Heat 10 tablespoons butter in 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat until melted, about 2 minutes. Continue cooking, swirling pan constantly until butter is dark golden brown and has nutty aroma, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove skillet from heat and, using heatproof spatula, transfer browned butter to large heatproof bowl. Stir remaining 4 tablespoons butter into hot butter until completely melted.  
Add both sugars, salt, and vanilla to bowl with butter and whisk until fully incorporated. Add egg and yolk and whisk until mixture is smooth with no sugar lumps remaining, about 30 seconds. Let mixture stand 3 minutes, then whisk for 30 seconds. Repeat process of resting and whisking 2 more times until mixture is thick, smooth, and shiny. Using rubber spatula or wooden spoon, stir in flour mixture until just combined, about 1 minute. Stir in chocolate chips and nuts (if using), giving dough final stir to ensure no flour pockets remain.  
Divide dough into 16 portions, each about 3 tablespoons (or use #24 cookie scoop). Arrange 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets, 8 dough balls per sheet. (Smaller baking sheets can be used, but will require 3 batches.)  
Bake cookies 1 tray at a time until cookies are golden brown and still puffy, and edges have begun to set but centers are still soft, 10 to 14 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking. Transfer baking sheet to wire rack; cool cookies completely before serving.  
  
BEFORE YOU BEGIN - Avoid using a nonstick skillet to brown the butter; the dark color of the nonstick coating makes it difficult to gauge when the butter is browned. Use fresh, moist brown sugar instead of hardened brown sugar, which will make the cookies dry. This recipe works with light brown sugar, but the cookies will be less full-flavored.   
WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS - Our perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe had to produce a cookie that would be moist and chewy on the inside and crisp at the edges, with deep notes of toffee and butterscotch to balance its sweetness. Melting the butter gave us the chewiness we were looking for. Cutting back on the flour and eliminating an egg white also improved texture and brought the brown sugar flavor to the fore. To give our chocolate chip cookie recipe the crisp edges and toffee flavor we wanted, we let the sugar dissolve in the batter for 10 minutes, then baked the cookies at a high temperature so the edges darkened while the centers stayed soft.",t2_j94rl,mybelle_michelle,0,1648936210.0,0,t1_i35lwfk,i35lwfk,False,nader0903,t3_tul2r5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tul2r5/where_is_the_best_chocolate_chip_cookie_in_mpls/,Where is the best chocolate chip cookie in MPLS or the western suburbs?,/r/Minneapolis/comments/tul2r5/where_is_the_best_chocolate_chip_cookie_in_mpls/i35lwfk/,8,r/Minneapolis,0,8

"Bull. Shit. Try biking in regular car traffic. Keeping bikers in separate lanes not only keeps bikers out of the way of drivers and keeps traffic flowing, it reduces the chance of collisions drastically. This country can't fucking fathom getting around in any way other than a car or truck, it's remarkable. Look at pedestrian deaths in a country like Japan or the Netherlands, they are significantly lower. And on top of all that, more bikers means less car traffic! Why do people like you insist that bikers and bike lanes are out for your cars, they help you guys in nearly every metric.

"I started off collecting vinyl but they can get pretty expensive.  Most places still have tapes priced pretty cheap although they are gaining in popularity. I like to use The Police and REM as examples as to why I have started collecting more tapes. Both bands are pretty legendary, but I have never really paid them much mind. 

Most of their records would probably cost $20 or more but I have gotten tapes from both bands for $2 a piece which makes rolling the dice and adding them to the collection a lot easier.  Yes I could use Spotify or YouTube, but my phone plan is super bare bones and the Wi-Fi at my apartment sucks. 

Plus if you spend enough time on r/cassetteculture you start to learn what tapes are rare and fetch top dollar, which makes it all the more exciting you find a Smith's cassette or a Radiohead tape out in the wild. Those albums are being repressed on vinyl every other year, but more often than not won't get the same treatment on cassette. 

Finally there is an element of nostalgia lumped in there too. Green Days Dookie was the first album I bought with my own money back in the day.  I dunno what happened to my original copy, but finding one on FB marketplace along with some other sweet tapes for $5 was pretty awesome.  The cassette culture subreddit is super cool too.  We do mix tape exchanges a couple times a year which has introduced me to alot of cool music, and I have people looking out for tapes I want, and I am doing the same for them.",t2_2qygz7u5,BanjoDude222,0,1648929442.0,0,t1_i357lx5,i357lx5,False,BanjoDude222,t3_tugk45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minneapolis/comments/tugk45/in_town_for_one_night_which_record_store_should_i/,in town for one night. which record store should I visit if I am looking for cassette tapes?,/r/Minneapolis/comments/tugk45/in_town_for_one_night_which_record_store_should_i/i357lx5/,6,r/Minneapolis,0,6

You need to be prepared to slow or stop at all times and if the cyclist is going 10 MPH, that is the flow of traffic and the driver needs to adjust.
