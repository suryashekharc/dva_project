"Vermont, and most all of Northern NE, would be as safest a bet
as anywhere; but if we're talking full-on SHTF/collapse (riding out
something for 6 months or more), then this story, and surviving
in general, is a lot of wishful notions.

Yes, it takes a community more than a bunker; and yes, VT'ers
are well pre-disposed to building around that. But, just being
a capable homesteader and decent hunter will not cut it; one's
ties to the community, their clan/family network, will be the
deciding factor (like rural anywhere).

""Lean Logic"" goes a long way to fleshing out the challenges
(including the 'transition town' org that developed around it).
But to think of a time ahead when systems are broken and
may resemble the 19th century more than the 20th (only 
worse), thinking
one can just relocate to the woods and survive is wishful
thinking.

Those (like myself) who managed to homestead and be (mostly)
self-sufficient succeeded only because we were a minority
enjoying the benefits of the 'civil' in civilization. A churn would
upend all that.",t2_ur5so,joeydokes,0,1649007895.0,0,t1_i38xrcv,i38xrcv,True,deadowl,t3_tveocf,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/tveocf/would_vermont_be_a_good_place_to_ride_out_an/,Would Vermont be a good place to ride out an apocalypse?,/r/vermont/comments/tveocf/would_vermont_be_a_good_place_to_ride_out_an/i38xrcv/,3,r/vermont,0,3

"I feel you on this so here‚Äôs my experience:

2. There are very few area that people go to ride because the land owner isn‚Äôt aware/doesn‚Äôt care. Most get shut down as soon as someone gets hurt or property is damaged (I‚Äôm thinking that place next to 7 in Milton). 
3. There is a race track in Derby and they have classes for all skill levels if you want some track time
4. There are plenty of people that ride private trails & tracks with explicit land owner permission, but finding those riders and places seems to be ‚ÄúI know someone who knows someone‚Äù effort.

It‚Äôs why the dollar slice is a myth outside of huge city‚Äôs.

"there‚Äôs plenty of hiking all around! a lot of people like to drive up route 100, it‚Äôs very scenic and you‚Äôll have access to the long trail at many points, which includes a lot of classic hikes like killington, camel‚Äôs hump, mansfield, and also many less trafficked areas. waterbury is right between montpelier and burlington and on route 100, so that might be a good place to orbit around.

if you make it up to lowell on route 100 (you could make this a detour on your way up to canada) you‚Äôll even find a cajun snack bar to feel right at home.

there are different interesting museums scattered all over, and historical societies in many towns and lots of people who love to chat. this sort of depends what you‚Äôre into. there tends to be more american history (battlefields, and other monuments) in the southern part of the state.

"Right, it would have to be sized correctly. I live in about 700 sq ft in an apartment with a 15 kBtu/hr heat pump providing the heat with no backup. I'm in Burlington, which is warmer than most the state, and the shared walls with other apartments drastically lower the heat demand, but it's 1890s construction improved as much as possible. New construction is easy to make much more efficient. 

Maybe the OP's new house would need around 10-12 kBtu/hr. Sizing doesn't need to be precise, but I was disappointed to learn that heat pumps' ""infinite variability"" is only within a turn down ratio which can be as low as 3. So minimum capacity and avoiding shortcycling is still a bit of an issue. 

Since winter design day conditions are so infrequent, I like pairing heat pumps with wood stoves for the coldest times and backup, but this space is probably too small for that.

A new system lol us poors learn ways around that crap. In my case I have a dry well if your not familiar it's a large concrete cylinder with holes and gravel packed on the outside. Not really a leach field per say but does the same job. When I bought the house I discovered some ass hat stuck an overflow pipe into it because it was not draining. The pipe was bubbling waste about 30 feet from the dry well gross and nasty. So I dug around the well and of course it had a thick biomat around it which was preventing the well from draining this is often the same failure issue in a flat leach field as well. Removed and replaced the gravel and now it works great. No need for a permit or a new system.

Strains hit different states at different times, with VT being hit with later strains (thanks to luck and population density), which were less deadly, than earlier ones, as more populous states were. Florida also has a vastly more diverse population than VT, and we know that hispanic and black americans are more prone to covid death than white americans, of which Vermont has literally the highest percent. That's a factor, no? Racist if you think not! But it is one of many things, and it is why FL should be compared to NY/NJ, not flippin Vermont. 

But you also cannot untangle economic strength from overall health. Poor economy = more deaths of despair, for example.

"This isn't entirely true. The cost of hardwood is significantly more than pine. Here's an example with local prices:

1x8x8 rough sawn pine is **$7.40** ([https://www.cliffordlumber.com/products/lumber](https://www.cliffordlumber.com/products/lumber))

That same 1x8x8 in rough sawn hard sap maple would be **$47.73** ($9.75 board ft. [https://hayleywoodproducts.com/](https://hayleywoodproducts.com/))

For the table in the above example done in hardwood there's probably $150 - $200 in wood and the lift mechanism is $200+ at Rockler. A quality natural wood finish suitable for a coffee table can be upwards of $30/qt. Hardwood is much ""harder"" on tools (jointers, planers, etc) and more time consuming to work with. Add in decent hardware, finer joinery, etc, etc. and there's a reason a table like that in Maple or White Oak or some other ""on trend"" wood  is likely going to cost $1500+ from a quality manufacturer like Pompy or Vermont Wood Studios.

There's also a misconception (not implying yours) that if something is $1500 from a small manufacturer that it will be less if you can find a one man custom woodworker. In fact the exact opposite is true. Just as you would expect in any other business, getting something custom from a small operation costs more. For some reason, though, its not uncommon for people to think the custom cabinets they got quoted from the local kitchen cabinet store can be made less expensively by a local builder.

"You might be able to ask them to build the design in a harder wood, I'm not sure if they do that there.

As an alternative to a harder wood, for one of the pieces I purchased there (and for some of the furniture I have made) that I knew would recieve a lot of mindless traffic, I coated it with https://vermontnaturalcoatings.com/product/polywhey-furniture-finish/ to give it some added durability. I'm a fan of VNC's products, though others I know have had bad luck with particular batches. 

The other item we purchased there (and the rest of the furniture I have made) we have intentionally left unfinished. Indeed, most of our furniture is unfinished... I revere the grain of the wood, the warmth, the malleability; love the stories contained in the ""dents"". To quote a mentor of mine:

""The table holds our things, our sustenance, our lives. If it is a wooden table, it also shows the marks, whether from wear or purposeful creation, that proves the presence and history of those who have genuflected before it in the short span of time that measures a human life."" 

(Mortier, R. Shamms. 'In the Company of Trees: Orbiting the Heart of the Sacred', 'Tables' chapter)

For the furniture I inherited from my parents, the pieces that remain as perfect as the day they were made really have no value to me and much of which I sold or sits in storage. The ones that contain the marks of a life well lived, like the table whose bottom is covered in pencil, crayon, and marker from my childhood that I'm not sure my parents ever knew about, are priceless to me. Likewise, for our own furniture, either bought or made, those items that my children have made marks on, or that my wife and I carved into or painted on a summer or winter's night, are my absolute favorites, even if I might have yelled ""don't color on that, here's a piece of paper!"" when I caught them.

"It's funny how people contrast outsiders with the in-group through suggesting that the frailties of human nature are overcome just because you live 'right here'. That high self opinion often leads to some kind of blind spot.

That's not to say there aren't material advantages to living somewhere, but it's not always something you can or should internalize. People who exhibit this behavior tend towards tribalism, or narcissism, or both.

"It's not a solution in search of a problem, it's a very early new solution to a range of problems, and it's up to the market to find ways to manifest those solutions. Maybe some type of private insurance, or better yet decentralized insurance, would check the box for some concerned about FDIC insurance? 

Not being connected to any government is a plus, but not if your only criteria is FDIC insurance. What about the individuals in Venezuela as their currency turned to dust? Should they not have a hedge? What about the individuals, the families just trying to feed themselves and their kids and pets, in Russia who saw a run on the bank and their currency turn to dust overnight? Should they not have a hedge?

What about dictatorships where individuals and families can flee with nothing but their memorized seed phrase and still have a fighting chance of starting some semblance of a life elsewhere? What about countries that simply don't have accessible banking services, but where people do have internet connected devices, like some places in Africa. Should they simply wait for their government to provide them with a better alternative? 

In my opinion, the exclusively pro-government currency perspective is an unempathetic point of view purely from a place of privilege, from a place of being so lucky to happen to be born here.

The above examples are specifically Bitcoin type currencies, and doesn't touch the immense value smart contracts can layer on.

"Amen!  Congrats on buying up here!  My wife and I just moved here in 2021 and we had to do the same thing. Sight unseen, great realtor, and had lost out on a couple properties and had to cancel a contract due to a really shitty chimney issue that would have cost 10's of thousands to fix.

We lucked out. Bought in Bradford, and man o man, has it been everything we wanted. We bought in town so we have amazing internet (400 up/ 15 down) and even though my wife commutes to Barre, it's on 2 days a week (thank you work from home). 

The whole process was scary as hell. Closing took an extra 60 days. We had already sold our FL home and moved to an AirBnB while my wife started work. We thought we were going to be homeless, but we somehow managed to get to closing. Outside of having to spend 10's of thousands on temp housing and some unfortunate repairs up front, it's been smooth sailing.

Was the most frustrating thing we have done, but the rewards are that we have a house in a place we want to be. I don't have to deal with FL  assholes everywhere I go now.

"> The definition of inflation literally is the government increasing the currency supply.

Yep, perfect book definition, and only possible with a fiat currency as we currently have. Oh, the revisionist history with a Ron Paul 08 Presidency... Why do we pay taxes when the Fed can just make new money? 

> People in power used people's fear of a virus as an opportunity to fleece the nation.

They got it while the getting was good, that's for sure. 2020-2021 policies created the greatest wealth transfer from the middle/lower classes to the most rich that has ever occurred in world history. 

I think it is in-part deliberate (high inflation) because, without high inflation, the USA would never be able to stay solvent on the national debt. But we keep trying to postpone the inevitable economic crash that is coming, with the injected money ""postponing it"" just making the crash-to-come worse. 

> There were a handful of countries that didn't freak out over this

I am so glad Sweden stayed strong as an anti-lockdown, anti-mask ""control group"". I am dismayed that they're not now looked to as the global model.

"Hardwood furniture is generally more expensive right now due to the pandemic, gas/shipping prices, and labor shortages. The studios that craft good pieces have reduced the amount of people working at one time during the last two years and are now playing catch-up.

I have actually worked with Vermont Woods Studios as a contractor and can personally attest for the quality of their products and the kindness of the people that work behind the scenes.

"A rare quality I observe from time to time in top 1% parents (not wealth, but thoughtfulness) is the mental flexibility to have anxieties themselves about certain things but simultaneously having the mental flexibility to not let these anxieties totally encroach upon the space and desires of their kid.

But at this stage in the pandemic, if your kid is vaccinated and so are you, I think we've reached a point where Covid warriors (which I count myself as one - boosted and wear n95s) who are also parents need to question whether their own anxieties are beginning to eclipse the solid instincts their kid might have to return to some normalcy in their childhood and take the mask off at school.

"Both studies referenced in this article literally just address whether or not kids can identify emotions behind a mask, (in 2012) not whether or not *development* is inhibited by never seeing their peers or adults facial expressions over an extended period of time.

It's not the same at all.

Just quizzing a kid whether or not they can read an emotion behind a mask (which they were incorrect at in these studies the majority of the time anyway) is not at all similar to  a controlled study over a period of time on the *development* of these abilities.

Really, it's like saying ""cars need oil changes after a certain amount of miles"" and then testing if a bunch of cars need oil, then saying that cars don't need oil because none of them required it at that point.

"1. Yes, but holy smokes they are high! 
2. Depends on the year. When we moved here the snow was thigh deep in mid March. This year it was gone by then. Colder winters are better because they make fluffy snow, which is easy (and fun) to clear with a broom. We came from NC, too, and we really love the winters here, which is surprising. Have a winter sport and wear the right layers. Winter hiking is awesome...no bugs, no sweat, the packed trails are much more level than in the summer, and way fewer people!
3. Yes, get VTel fiber if you can. Comcast is the wooooorst.
4. No one talks about the flipping mice! We catch several dozen each fall/winter in traps and we keep our pantry items in mason jars or other mouse proof containers. Also, living here requires more mindfulness. Fill up your tank at 1/3-1/2 because there aren't a lot of gas stations. And there's like no traffic, which is amazing. The quality and variety of locally produced food is staggering. It's incredible.
5. Absolutely. It's not an easy place to live, but it's an amazing place to live. 
6. Not sure, but all the small towns we've been to are lovely. I would not want to live in a city here.

"1. For me it is.  But I can't answer that question for you.  What other places are you considering?  What's the tax difference, what's the service difference, whats the cultural difference?  If taxes are your number one concern, I don't think Vermont will be your best state.  Taxes are high and they don't pay for things I use - BUT taxes fund vermont, and I like vermont.  I like that my taxes aren't wasted on paved roads.  I like that my town has green energy goals.  I like many of our state's funding priorities.  
2. What do you mean by ""truly"" over?  Most people don't start planting their gardens outside until late may.  
3. Depends on the ISP.  Comcast - sometimes.  ECFiber - Yes.  Others - ???
4. Dirt roads are fun this time of year, and big vehicles (like dump trucks) are not allowed on them from march to mid-may.  Plows don't get to the interstate some mornings until 10am.  Heating in winter is very very expensive.
5. Yes.  But that is because where I am in vermont meshes with me.  I like the people I meet.  I like the state's politics.  I like the rural character.  Hell, I love that my road is unpaved even though it turns to soup this time of year.
6. Depends on what you are looking for.  Some people hate on Brattleboro, but I love wandering around town every time I visit.  Some people think Randolph is dead, but it feels vibrant for the size.  Some people hate springfield, but I run into so many nice people every time im there.  But really, there are a bunch of properly rated towns depending on what you are looking for.  Woodstock is not for everyone, but it is a retirement goal for others.  The NEK is lonely rural hell for some, but a quiet slice of heaven for others.  

If you're seriously thinking about Vermont, just know that it's a long drive between towns/cities, and that can be isolating.  If I need to go to a big box store for some reason, it's an hour drive one way.

"1) ""Worth it"" is subjective. You'll pay a lot and not get much for them as you do in many other states. What you get for them is relative emptiness. As someone else alluded to, the high taxes are a function of the small population/economies of scale.

3) Internet varies by town and even road or house. We have some excellent local ISPs with plenty fast internet even in rural areas. Be sure to look into it carefully, though, before purchasing.

4) Winter related expenses such as heating bills, firewood (if you buy it), plow bills, snow tires, etc. can get REALLY, REALLY expensive.

"The definition of inflation literally is the government increasing the currency supply. What we feel over time is the effect of inflation. Goods and services are governed by supply, demand, time preference, all the things which establish price which can typically be identified readily when we study a market situation. 

When the entire economy is slipping and the purchasing power of the currency is being debased, that's not pure coincidence. That's not an invitation to single out any particular industry and ignore everything else. The media and politicians do this. They run compartmentalized stories that never link up with the causation.

You can't print half the currency that the US has ever had in circulation in a matter of a few years and not expect consequences for that. It's rolling forward in the momentum of its own destruction. People in power used people's fear of a virus as an opportunity to fleece the nation.

>without even considering the impacts of the global economic shutdown policies they championed. 

The finger pointing has already begun. They'll blame everyone and everything else for this.

>... meanwhile, Countries that still keep decent normalized data on Covid by vaccine status, like Canadian provinces and the UK, are seeing a divergence where per-population infection rates keep trending higher for those with ""more"" vaccination...

"Sort of, kind of on topic‚Ä¶ I lived in SC for a few years in the early 80‚Äôs. My friend asked me if I wanted to go to a farmer‚Äôs market in Columbia. Sure. Saturday off, beautiful day, nice ride. It was held in the parking lot of a stadium. This was not the farmer‚Äôs market you may think of, rather, think of truckloads of produce, tractor trailers full of produce. You get a watermelon for about 0.05 to .10 cents if you bought 500 of them kind of produce. In one of the many rows was a pickup truck with a sleeper cab. Outside of said truck was a large table of many mason jars, the quart size, full of syrup with a generic white label and black letters that read ‚ÄúVermont Maple Syrup‚Äù.  The price was a dollar a jar. Now, momma didn‚Äôt raise no fool. That‚Äôs too cheap even then. I‚Äôd been in SC long enough I could fake a decent southern accent if I didn‚Äôt speak too long.

Thought the fellows eyes were going to pop out of his head. He actually sputtered for several seconds and ‚ÄúY‚Äôall wait right here, I got more in the truck y‚Äôall like‚Äù.

"This might take a while, but there are some misunderstandings here that you might have. Maybe it's my misinterpretation of your words. I guess we can take them in order:

>Unbanked citizens are first of mind

Crypto is not a solution to this. Non-fiat or fiat isn't the issue here, it's access to services. If you have access to a phone, you could have access to a bank with fiat currency, just like you can with crypto.

The only solution crypto offers to the unbanked is access to a volatile asset, and access to exchanges that will not work without access the internet.

Fiat currency works without the internet. Is recognizable by a human. And you can pay taxes with it.

>Quick settlement of transactions (instant in crypto days-weeks in fiat)

It takes almost 30 minutes to buy Bitcoin.

Bitcoin, the leading crypto is notoriously slow by design and can only theoretically handle a certain number of transactions per amount of time. True?

&#x200B;

Also, there's no way to effeciently reverse transactions in crypto. Isn't that correct?

&#x200B;

Settlement of transactions, by far, favors the current system over any widely implemented crypto""currency"". I'm sure some imagined future implementation will fix that lack of reversibility...

>easy to transfer vs sending armored vehicles full of USD to banks to and from, sometimes resulting in loss of life when thief's try to steal it. Crypto doesn't have this issue.

Is this a serious response? I honestly can't tell if you're being serious here.

You know USD can be wired, digitally? You don't have to send actual physical cash?

And that crypto, which certainly has a physical location, being the wallet, can definitely be stolen....

do you need examples of crypto that was stolen?

>Inflation, You can't print more BTC there will never ever be more then 21 million tokens.

I think I'll ask again, do you have anidea why **every modern nation** abandoned non-fiat currency?

There's a long history there, and some very basic economic lessons to be learned about inflation and non-fiat currencies. I can give you some links if you'd like.

>Foreign exchange fees take an obscene amount of the transaction. How would you like to pay up to 10% to send millions of dollars to your bank overseas and wait a week for it to land in your account?

How is that an advantage for cryptos?

There's exchange fees there too....

That has nothing to do with fiat or non-fiat currencies, but more a comment on foreign exchanges and their fees.

>Threat of confiscation, if you use a personal wallet where you are the only one with the seed phrase this is impossible with crypto.

Are you implying there is no way you, your bitcoin or your wallet could be locked out of the system by any exchanges?

Pretty sure you're wallet can be confiscated, maybe just not used.

&#x200B;

In fact, didn't the FBI just confiscate a bunch of wallets from some crypto thieves?

&#x200B;

>For others reading this, a fiat currency is one that has no real value to back up its status except the word of the national government that tells us it is worth whatever they say.

You mean an economy and military and all the powers of taxation a state has over any and all markets it interacts with....

>This also allowed the government to claim the USD is backed by our GDP and they have more internal control over the supply allowing them to control the currency better. This is why if you pull out a dollar bill it will say on it ""Federal Reserve Note"" What is a note? A note is a promise to pay back a debt. So the USD is literally backed by debt. and thanks to Collin Powell printing 80% of the USD supply in the last few years they have increased inflation and made the USD vulnerable to massive devaluation similar to what happened recently in Venezuela. This scares the shit out of me.

You just described fiat money like it was somehow surprising to learn how it works?

And it's Jerrome Powell, Colin Powell is dead.

>There are decentralized exchanges out there and I have used many of them like Uniswap, Sushiswap, and more, they don't have this issue. DeFi is a solution to this exchange issue. Yes a cryptocurrency can be controlled by a majority holder of the crypto which is why it is important that we don't lets someone hold all the tokens. Governments have the power to buy up enough of a token to make this a non issue but even better would be if many many people also hold more then the majority this is a non issue. I'll give this one credit for being a real issue.

This is a core issue that you cannot solve without state intervention, which is defacto giving the state control but now **just without the actual tools to make the fiscal and monetary policy work in concert.**

That's a core issue and why non-fiat currency has been a disaster for any modern economy.

How many BTC does the unknown founder of BTC have?

And if sold them all tomorrow, would it tank the market?

>I believe there is regulation that is long overdue for the crypto space and the company I work for has been advocating for the SEC to do just this for over 8 years.

I agree it should be regulated, but there basic, core flaws that make it a volatile asset (not a currency) that is a net negative (energy consumption v use cases) on society as a whole.

There are use cases for blockchain. Crypto-""currency"" is a not a good one.

>This is also a issue not because of the DAO but a understanding issue as the users obviously didn't see the flaw in the system design. We are in the baby stages of crypto especially DAOs and there will be many bad designs that make the news. But the innovators are looking into why it was able to be hacked and fix it with code. Something not really doable with fiat.

This is the anthem. ""Yes, there's some core flaws in the design, but the imagined future iteration will fix that"".

Cryptocurrency is a blockchain use case looking for a problem in the wrong area.

The amount of resources wasted, actual in-the-world waste, due to the energy consumption that comes from doing useless math to come up with 'cryptocurrency' is astounding.",t2_8g7u8,Moth4Moth,0,1648750961.0,0,t1_i2vo8r2,i2vo8r2,False,Clamato-n-rye,t3_tsd67t,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/tsd67t/a_frank_discussion_about_nonfungible_tokens_and/,A 'Frank' Discussion About Non-Fungible Tokens and Cryptocurrency,/r/vermont/comments/tsd67t/a_frank_discussion_about_nonfungible_tokens_and/i2vo8r2/,3,r/vermont,0,3

"RoW's are the worst.  There should never have been such a concept. If people want access, they should outright buy it.

There might be some conditions outlined in the deed.  Usually you can do whatever you want except block his access. Having said, he can be an ass.  I can speak from experience. I had an asshole who had a right of way through my property by my house.  The first time we went to the town hall, the town clerk warned us about him.  He was a rich guy whose family was well known for stealing land. They had a surveyor in the family. They would buy property and survey it and move the boundaries.  They also had no problem moving RoWs. If they didn't like where they had a RoW, they would just move it. They would buy land locked lots with RoWs and then just put their access road wherever they wanted. Nevermind where the RoW actually was. The only way to fight them was to pay for surveyors and lawyers. Nobody could afford to do that and they knew it.  They preyed on people. They literally would look thru listings to find ways to make money off other people's situations. 

Anyway, he was a complete ass and his treatment of us was essentially harassment.  It's pretty bad when the town clerk feels she needs to warn you about people like that.  Long story short, he ended up having a cash flow problem and I ended up buying his land (and RoW). I spent about twice what the property was worth and literally only bought it just to get rid of him and all the scum bags he used to send up to bother us. The land is worthless. You can't build on it and the guy logged it so hard the property was thrown out of Current Use.

"I was replying to just your last comment, to illustrate that you don't have to invest in any of it to contribute to its success. Take Brave, for example. You might migrate from Chrome or Firefox for the saved bandwidth or increased privacy and in doing so support the BAT ecosystem and Ethereum blockchain, even unknowingly.

For fun though: whether or not there's intrinsic value, I guess would depend on the definition. It's typically a value based on assumptions so there's a twinge of speculation baked in. I don't know how you'd calculate intrinsic value of a distributed blockchain like Ethereum. If you could invest in the internet and in doing so contribute to its reliability, what would be the intrinsic value of that token? I wouldn't say zero. The more services and real world use cases that find their way to these technologies, the higher the intrinsic value, and likely *much* higher the speculative value.

Is there intrinsic value for NFTs? I think so, but not uniformly.

"I live on a chunk of land with 4 neighbors. Basically 5 families bought the land together and built on the lower portion and then kept the upper portion for sugaring/conservation/recreation. The lower building portion is full of springs and huge rocks and very unflat areas - plus our town has a 10acre zoning law, so property lines are a friggen mess. There‚Äôs one house below me, and then the other three are up behind me. The only road in is an easement that goes right over my front lawn - it‚Äôs a fully maintained private road but in reality I own it all and just have to allow access. 

I am lucky because it is a great group of neighbors who have all been there decades - we‚Äôre the new kids. Luckily someone had the forethought to get a legal agreement in place so we have an ‚ÄúHOA‚Äù (we hate to call it that‚Ä¶) which serves as a legal agreement to spell out snow removal and maintenance for the shared driveway/private road. Because it‚Äôs entirely on my land, technically I could be held responsible for all maintenance on that portion, this would be frustrating since my driveway is before this portion so I literally never drive on it and could care less if it disappeared. So our HOA agreement spells out that I pay for ~20% of road maintenance since I only drive on 20% of the road, then the folks who live higher up pay for their percentage and so on and so forth. 

So what I‚Äôm getting at is - even with great understanding neighbors we still have a legal agreement in place to protect everyone. This makes it so that there are no questions and everyone is held accountable. I would suggest getting legal counsel and consider putting further protections in place if necessary.

It also helps that we all have a sort of unwritten agreement that we consider geographical boundaries more than legal boundaries. So while I own an additional 20 yards past the road, I pretty much let the neighbor on that side have free run of it. It would be a weird strip for me to maintain and visually it looks more like their land anyway. I WOULDNT recommend this for you, but it helps in our case.

"\#1 - I don't feel I get much out of them. Many years ago, we had a group of teens that would come onto our land at night, sit on our propane tank, and drink. Call the police and the response we always got was ""by the time we get out there..."" It was frustrating. Essentially, taxes in the country pay for the road crews to plow. They haven't cleared out the drainage ditches in over 10 years and you can bug the town and get told that they have other priorities first. 

\#2 - Winter ends when it wants to. It also begins when it wants to. I've seen snow in every month but July and August, and I know my parents always said July was the only month they'd never seen snow. What's worth noting is that you will move from winter to blackflies to mosquitoes to deerflies and horseflies and back to winter.

\#3 - I just had a lot of fun with Comcast/Xfinity. I'd been on Comcast Business for 10 years as I have a home office. When I signed up, basic was all that was available and that was 30 Mbps for $90. I wanted to upgrade speeds and was told that they didn't know why I was allowed on Comcast Business in the first place. For that reason, I was told to increase to 100 Mbps, I was going to have to pay almost $300 a month. If I wanted 300 Mbps, I was going to go to almost $500 a month. I laughed and called Xfinity residential who said they could convert my account to residential and took care of it for me. I now will pay $45ish a month (year introductory rate) for 300 Mbps. I ran speed tests yesterday afternoon and pull around 270 Mbps at the peak of the day. In the early morning when I actually start working, I was at 350 Mbps. it is fast, but I have friends who live a mile away who can't get Comcast/Xfinity. Location is key.

"Yes.

I'd go one further. Wearing a mask can increase viral contagion:

Coronavirus is miniscule in size compared to the fabric and the pores of a mask. Unless you're wearing an aerosol filtering mask you're not going to have meaningful protection. Further, the air will flow around the gaps of the mask with less resistance, and when you breath in and out with something over your face you create a moisture trap that viruses and bacteria can land on far more easily, increasing your chances of contracting something. If you are wearing a mask to prevent others from getting sick it is negated over time by breathing in the same air.

Giving people a psychological placebo, a false sense of security against contracting and spreading a virus is unethical because you are lying to people. This is what mandating masks has resulted in. It's a foundation based on ignorance, lies, and appeal to authority. We have people in this thread calling other people children for not wearing masks while not acknowledging the science.

It's crazy that so many people have gone along with this. Isolating when sick is common sense. Treating coronavirus like it's a factor more serious than the flu and then justifying shutting down the economy is insanity.",t2_9ybx8,PeppermintPig,0,1648742640.0,0,t1_i2v2b65,i2v2b65,False,dropkickninja,t3_tsyoln,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/tsyoln/a_vermont_school_district_reimposed_a_mask/,A Vermont school district reimposed a mask mandate.

"I'm sort of in the opposite boat: We have a seasonal camp that is accessed via easement across the land of our neighbor, who is in the process of building a home on her land. She doesn't currently live there. We have 4WD vehicles, she does not. The driveway, that we share, is dirt and steep, and tends to get washed out a bit in the winter from run-off. My husband has a grader for our tractor and does his best to fix it, but we aren't professionals by any means. Neighbor got a quote for $6k to have someone come in and re-grade or whatever the driveway and wanted to split it with us. Mind you, we have no issue with the driveway in our cars or on our motorcycles.   I straight told her that $3k for a driveway isn't in the budget right now, because it's not.

This was last fall. I've heard crickets from her since. I feel badly about my response, but I'm also not about to throw money at a problem I don't have. We are happy to share costs on the driveway; we shared plowing costs 2 years ago when she was first building so her builders could access the land, even though we weren't planning to be there much. The extended access was a benefit to us, but not something we needed.

Covid is more contagious than the flu these days. Ties way back to us getting lucky after the spanish flu (which people eagerly masked up to avoid mind you) when that strain luckily mutated into a less deadly variant of itself.

In no way do you question the efficacy of masks... except in your argument here I guess.

I think of myself as being plenty healthy, but the reason we're having this discussion is because I'm stuck on my couch half fucking dead from covid, and it's been worse than any flu I've ever had in my life (if we're talking about personal experience now). I'm finally starting to come out the other side of it, and I gotta tell you friend, I would **NEVER** tell **ANYONE** that they should just work on their health so it won't be so bad for them if they do get it.

"> Being nice to someone else means risking whether or not they'll return the favor.

I think we found another issue. Why expect anything back? Is it really that hard or that much of an issue just to be a decent and considerate person? What if someone has no means to give back? Does that mean they don't deserve for anyone to treat them decently?

> It's a zero sum game.

Is it really? Zero sum game means the following to me:

> Zero-sum is a situation in game theory in which one person's gain is equivalent to another's loss, so the net change in wealth or benefit is zero.

Seems to me that the people who are still concerned over masking have some pretty significant reasons why, usually relating to health concerns for themselves or loved ones.

"Major issues with FIAT

* Unbanked citizens are first of mind. See here for why: [https://bloombergcities.medium.com/bringing-unbanked-residents-into-the-financial-mainstream-c82dd5297f92](https://bloombergcities.medium.com/bringing-unbanked-residents-into-the-financial-mainstream-c82dd5297f92). Just look at the country of Bhutan they have like 80% of their population unbanked. People in these countries don't have access to banks. Often if they do have banking they have to travel hundreds of miles to do their banking. Luckily cellphones are cheap and many of these countries have a cell network so a mobile phone and a crypto wallet would solve many of the money issues. see how much of the world is unbanked here: https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/worlds-most-unbanked-countries
* Quick settlement of transactions (instant in crypto days-weeks in fiat)
* easy to transfer vs sending armored vehicles full of USD to banks to and from, sometimes resulting in loss of life when thief's try to steal it. Crypto doesn't have this issue.
* Inflation, You can't print more BTC there will never ever be more then 21 million tokens.
* Foreign exchange fees take an obscene amount of the transaction. How would you like to pay up to 10% to send millions of dollars to your bank overseas and wait a week for it to land in your account?
* limited divisibility of money is also an issue for micropayments. some smart developers have coded stealing fractions of a cent and their program has gone undiscovered for years only to find they now have millions from this code. a number have been caught and jailed.
* Threat of confiscation, if you use a personal wallet where you are the only one with the seed phrase this is impossible with crypto.

I could go on here but I'll stop here.

`If you can tell me, what were the major problems associated with non-fiat currencies and why did every country in the entire world abandon non-fiat currencies?`

For others reading this, a fiat currency is one that has no real value to back up its status except the word of the national government that tells us it is worth whatever they say.   


`""In the beginning, precious metals like gold and silver were used to buy and sell goods and services, but we eventually grew weary of lugging around those chunks of metal and decided to substitute pieces of paper with a face value equal to an amount of gold kept in the issuing bank or government. The theory was that any citizen could decide on a whim that he‚Äôd rather have the gold than paper and walk up to a bank and demand an exchange. This was called being on the gold standard. It didn‚Äôt take our leaders long to figure out that keeping all that gold in reserve was a hassle and people would spend money just as readily if there wasn‚Äôt a vault full of gold somewhere guaranteeing that the paper had value.`  
  
`Thus the fiat currency was born."" -` [https://americanmonetaryassociation.org/2010/12/09/how-the-us-dollar-came-to-be-a-fiat-currency/](https://americanmonetaryassociation.org/2010/12/09/how-the-us-dollar-came-to-be-a-fiat-currency/)

This also allowed the government to claim the USD is backed by our GDP and they have more internal control over the supply allowing them to control the currency better. This is why if you pull out a dollar bill it will say on it ""Federal Reserve Note"" What is a note? A note is a promise to pay back a debt. So the USD is literally backed by debt. and thanks to Collin Powell printing 80% of the USD supply in the last few years they have increased inflation and made the USD vulnerable to massive devaluation similar to what happened recently in Venezuela. This scares the shit out of me.  


`A dollar bill is not lawful money, but rather ‚Äúlegal tender.‚Äù`

  


`""You know they could have USD and have the same outcome, yes?""`

You're missing the point what I was sharing. Their country is in a disaster zone and  I doubt there are many banks open. If they had any access to the internet which is possible over what cell towers are still standing or satellite phones they could still transact from within the country or just get to a safe one and transact there in crypto. I'm sure the bank in the neighboring country will want all kinds of information that might have been destroyed of left when they fled. Again not a issue with Crypto. As you are seeing in the news Russia wants their rupee for gas payments but others are not accepting this demand even when they try to force other countries to pay for their product. i.e., [https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2022/mar/29/no-plans-to-pay-in-rupee-for-crude-oil-from-russia-government-2435399.html](https://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2022/mar/29/no-plans-to-pay-in-rupee-for-crude-oil-from-russia-government-2435399.html)  
And if we're being real here if the entire infrastructure is down there are much bigger issues at hand and you may be looking more for the basics of food, shelter, water, and safety.

`A decentralized currency could still be controlled by those who control the exchanges, or buy simply owning all or a majority of the currency, which allows them to manipulate prices.`  
  
See my reply here for this answer: [https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/tsd67t/comment/i2uhgvf/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/tsd67t/comment/i2uhgvf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

There are decentralized exchanges out there and I have used many of them like Uniswap, Sushiswap, and more, they don't have this issue. DeFi is a solution to this exchange issue. Yes a cryptocurrency can be controlled by a majority holder of the crypto which is why it is important that we don't lets someone hold all the tokens. Governments have the power to buy up enough of a token to make this a non issue but even better would be if many many people also hold more then the majority this is a non issue. I'll give this one credit for being a real issue.

`Without a state regulating markets, those type of market manipulations are common place.`  
   
I believe there is regulation that is long overdue for the crypto space and the company I work for has been advocating for the SEC to do just this for over 8 years.   
  
`Didn't that happen in a bunch of the DAO these idiots set up? People gamed the system, voted themselves total control of the DAO and then stole all the money?`  


This is also a issue not because of the DAO but a understanding issue as the users obviously didn't see the flaw in the system design. We are in the baby stages of crypto especially DAOs and there will be many bad designs that make the news. But the innovators are looking into why it was able to be hacked and fix it with code. Something not really doable with fiat.

This is why I tell others to keep their tokens in their wallet where they are the custodian of the keys. These centralized exchanges are a on/off ramp into the crypto space and you should not be keeping your fund on these exchanges. You should be keeping them in your wallet. This aligns with the ethos of cryptocurrency and it's need to be created. The inability to trust any single entity other then yourself. For example the truckers in Canada just last month.  Their go fund me was shutdown so they started taking crypto payments. But since they used a exchange wallet to collect the funds the exchange company still has to follow the government laws in which they operate. So even if it's unethical and wrong the government can and will as Canada has shown take your money. And if a peaceful country such as Canada is capable of doing this it should demonstrate that any other government would do the same. Their issue was one of trusting another company with the keys to their crypto safe. Had they used a private self managed wallet the would not have had any issue except how to off ramp these fund in their country. But as wealthy people have shown there are many ways around this issue with fiat let alone crypto.

I would urge you to do the same.

Let's just start with the basics, alright?

If you can tell me, what were the major problems associated with non-fiat currencies and why did **every country in the entire world abandon non-fiat currencies**?

&#x200B;

And I gotta say, the evidence of a Ukranian leaving with Bitcoin being a way bitcoin helps people, is kinda insane, right?

You know they could have USD and have the same outcome, yes?

>Feudal means that some central authority had control.Who is in control of BTC? What corporation or government has control? Please tell me.

A decentralized currency could still be controlled by those who control the exchanges, or buy simply owning all  or a majority of the currency, which allows them to manipulate prices.

Without a state regulating markets, those type of market manipulations are common place.

Didn't that happen in a bunch of the DAO these idiots set up? People gamed the system, voted themselves total control of the DAO and then stole all the money?

"I'm also going to give Rutland a shout out. For those ages Rutland Town and Barstow (Mendon+Chittenden) are great schools. The high school is not terrible, academically speaking.

I find that there is a big range of liberal to conservative people here. 

For outdoors, Rutland is amazing. There's tons of fishing, mountain biking, hunting, skiing, etc and all within 15-30 minutes. I rarely leave the area, and spend all year outside recreating.

Your ssn is essentially a serial number that represents your value to the government. Keep in mind it‚Äôs not an nft you own but one the government owns - you are the value. The technology behind nfts has nothing to do with images. It‚Äôs a decentralized record of proof of ownership. In the future the deed to your property may be replaced by an nft to keep that record.

"If you're building one on some sort of foundation, the Fair Housing Act requires that any local zoning district allowing for single family detached residential not to discriminate against trailers and tiny homes. Form-based codes and dimensional standards (like footprint size, frontage build-out, minimum height, and/or lot cover regulations) are definitely kosher though, so you should check with the relevant local planning and zoning folks to be sure you're above board.

The thing about tiny homes though is that they virtually never pencil out, because if you're buying land to put one on directly, the cost of providing your own utilities is going to be the same regardless, so it's not going to be much of a cost savings to build a very small home and have it be wildly expensive per square foot. And if you're going to co-locate with others to spread those costs out, why not just buy a single wide. They're virtually always cheaper despite the higher square footage",t2_146lye,Americ-anfootball,0,1648688184.0,0,t1_i2sfc2n,i2sfc2n,True,GREATWHITESILENCE,t3_trlsy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/vermont/comments/trlsy7/tiny_house/,Tiny house.,/r/vermont/comments/trlsy7/tiny_house/i2sfc2n/,1,r/vermont,0,1
