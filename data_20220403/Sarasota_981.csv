"Couple notable things.. looks like they are switching to automate the pick up of everything.. the driver controlling an arm to pick up household trash.. North Port does this already..

>Sarasota County is considering automated garbage collection in carts (similar to the recycling program). If your household currently places more than 90 gallons of garbage at the curb each week for pickup, which option would you prefer for additional garbage material?

Interesting...

>Currently the county must pay for yard waste materials to be manually emptied out of bags at the Central County Landfill before processing as a mulch/compost material. In FY21, the equivalent of more than 6.4 million 39-gallon heavy duty, plastic garbage bags of yard waste were opened by hand and the county anticipates spending $300,000+ for bag removal in FY22. Would you support the elimination of plastic bags and be willing to bundle, use paper bags or containers for yard waste?*

Either way.. I think the automation of picking up curbside items is going to occur.. relation is not causation, but it's hard enough already finding people to ride the back of the truck to pick up what's on the curb.

"There's an open food bank at the Gold Rush BBQ if you need food.

There's a habitat for humanity off of Center just to the north of you. They might be a good place to find resources or a job. Salvation army is near Detwiler's.

You should frequent marketplaces like: freecycle, Facebook, nextdoor, craigslist, offerup, and there's even an app called Freebie Alerts, you know for free stuff you might need or want. Lots of furniture in the area. 

Also the snow birds are all leaving soon so get ready for thrift stores to be flooded with goods they don't want to take home or store for 9 months. Lot of potentally useful stuff being thrown out.

Check out apps like Couch Surfing.

Get yourself a nice functional bike with a rack or two, but nothing too nice unless you can watch it 24/7. Venice is very accessible by bike.

Def look for a room mate, don't pay night to night at hotels unless you have to cuz they'll bleed you dry. Keep your nose clean and stay away from most of the other young homeless guys in the area if you can. A lot of them are on hard drugs. Stay out the sun and in the shade when the UV is high if you can.

I can't speak for the quality of jobs or pay, but theres lots and lots of places hiring if you need something immediately.

Contango Lesson: How Koch Industries Raises Gas Prices

""Not only hedge funds, banks and other speculators manipulate the price of oil. So do big energy companies, such as Koch Industries. The chemicals and petroleum company does it by purchasing large stocks of oil and storing it in offshore supertankers and giant containers. Then it sits on those supplies until oil prices rise.

That strategy is called ""contango,"" which is when the future price of a commodity is expected to top the current price. This isn't unusual in these markets. It just means that demand at some point down the road is forecast to exceed supply. Unlike pure speculators dealing in futures contracts, however, companies like Koch actually buy and hold oil. And because that reduces supply, as demand increases gas prices rise. Fortune's Jon Birger estimated in 2008 that a 200,000-barrel-a-day decrease in oil supplies could boost gas prices by upwards of 40 cents a gallon.""

"Psychologist here working at a self-pay practice. The results are what they are, and I get paid the same amount regardless. 🤷🏼‍♀️I don’t even make a recommendation as to eligibility; I just provide a report with the results and interpretation.   Most of not all of my private pay colleagues do the same. There truly isn’t a way to “fake” results unless the clinician is giving the child the answers or providing credit for incorrect answers intentionally. And if that’s the case, that will come to light real fast when the child can’t perform in real life commensurate with their test results and then that clinician’s license will be on the line. It’s just not worth it.  

The only thing that comes close to what you’re describing is that sometimes a parent will bring a child in who has been tested multiple times. Ethically, this presents a challenge for me, because it’s not best practice to “test shop” this way. However, I will often perform another assessment because Sarasota county requires that test scores come from the same administration- in other words, if a child has already demonstrated that they can perform in the gifted range in reading, but math was lower due to issues with time (just for example), the county requires another administration of a reading assessment; they will not accept the previous score.  On a related note, I practiced for many years in another state and I do not agree with Florida’s gifted process as a whole, particularly requiring both reading and mathematics to be in the gifted range; I believe children can demonstrate specific skills and still be considered gifted in one area. But I digress.

"I see some other opinion posts so I just have to drop this in here:

I loved PV. I went 2-12 and there were times when I felt like switching out around middle school, but I'm so glad I didn't. I don't believe I could have gone anywhere else that could have equipped me better for life after graduation. I had my own group of down to earth friends and it was just incredibly supportive and empowering. Because I went to PV and saw my peers succeed and aim high, I realized I could too. That's the only reason I applied out of state. In the end, I was accepted and went to a highly ranked college almost fully funded. I was also able to travel and study internationally on scholarships and do a number of really incredible internships. I don't come from a wealthy background, but I found an access point into that kind of a world through PV. It isn't for everyone, but it was a perfect fit for me.

"i think the testing depends on the grade afaik. but a word of warning: many, many kids come out of that school with anxiety (the diagnosable kind). i did, most people i knew did. the atmosphere there is so competitive that its suffocating at times. if your student has a good support system they should be fine, for the most part.

its also changed significantly, especially with regards to the non stem programs. theres not much funding for them, so if your kid is interested in things other than science or math, consider that. its not quite the experience you hear about from alums that graduated under previous principals. not that anything is wrong with the current one, theres just less variety.

also, not sure about the class ranking thing someone else said, but i was there for 10 years and never heard of there ever being rankings. the competition and feeling like failure isnt an option is definitely there, but i personally think a lot of it was from the teachers and admin, not students. every year there were assemblies where they’d shove the “212 philosophy” down our throats and it got really old after a while. 

as far as college chances, it should not hurt you to go there. the whole “colleges dont like accepting too many pine view kids” thing is a rumor. at least thats what the college reps that came to campus always said. 50 kids from my class of 200 went to UF (the school that everyone says is super selective about PV applicants) if that tells you anything. 

i dont regret going there, but sometimes i do wonder what my life would be like had i not. i ended up at my dream college, but i have a terrible fear of failure that manifests in ways that limit my exploration academically.  but it was a unique experience that i did enjoy for the most part. having so many APs was nice, as it got me out of undergrad in three years, but i would have liked to see a more multidisciplinary approach to what was taught and more options in general. what was nice, though, is that no one ever got made fun of for being a nerd, or being “too smart”.

"Having worked for a major scholarship provider in town for over a decade, and having worked closely with every high school in SRQ and surrounding counties, I would caution against the assumption that Pineview is superior to other options. It's good for some kids, but bad for others. And it both helps and hurts their chances of admission to some colleges.

The one thing you need to know about Pinewood is that the academic pressure there can be very intense. Not so much from the teachers, but the other students. You know they had to stop class ranks there because they were causing so much unhealthy competition? A 4.0 GPA is laughable at Pinewood where many students are closer to 5.0 with weighted AP courses. 

And then there is the perception of Pinewood students at, well, basically every other educational institution and scholarship provider. The term ""Pinewood Brats"" is ubiquitous and clearly well-earned. They're going to be discriminated against in most other contexts, even by their fellow students at other schools.

"Do you live in and have your kids attend Sarasota county schools already?  If so, you need to work through your school's ESE liaison to apply to Pine View. The website below outlines what's required:

https://www.sarasotacountyschools.net/Page/2638

Basically it is a two step process. First your children have to score above a 130 (two standard deviations) on an IQ test and an academic achievement test. Your home school will offer a no cost preliminary screening, and if they score above 130 on the screening, the district will have one of their school psychologists do the IQ and achievement tests at no charge to you. If they score below 130 on the screening, you will have to pay a psychologist directly to administer the two tests. The deadline to request a screening at your home school passed in January.

Once your kid completes the two tests (with high enough scores), then your ESE department will work with you to complete the rest of the documents required to formally have your kid designated as a ""gifted magnet"" student at which point you can apply to Pine View.

As climate change is reportedly what's driving the increased frequency and severity of destructive weather events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, bitter frigid weather and snowstorms, which in turn affect the risk burden insurance companies take when insuring private residences and business facilities, I beg to differ with your claim that it has nothing to do with insurance rates.  As any insurance actuary or statistician can tell you, anything that affects risk affects insurance rates.  
Doctor, heal thyself.  
In other words, u/TRIGGERHAPYx, I recommend you take your own advice: educate yourself.  Even YOUR link  provides this intel, ""Your insurance premiums will likely go up in 2022 -- if they haven't already. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many insurance companies have seen elevated claims activity. Extreme weather events, pandemic-related claims, civil unrest, and inflationary pressures have put pressure on insurance companies' profitability.

"I like the downtown area, 2 or 3 metaphysical shops if that's your thing, a used bookstore on main, about a score of cafes (of kors is a personal favorite but breakfast house or c'est la vie are better for sit down), antique stores too. In fact if you like antiquing or thrifting, Sarasota is great (check out canned Ham Vintage for a beautiful and curated selection of goods from the 50s through 70s that are ACTUALLY USEABLE) 

The ballet is one of the best in the country, though I think it's expensive (I've only ever bought student tickets) and may not be running a show when you're in town.

More aquarium is obviously touristy but also a lot of fun no matter what, and the beach on that island (kenthompson park I believe?) is my favourite in town bc no one is ever there.

If you're outdoorsy, there are a couple nature parks. Myakka is bigger but there's also Oscar scherer, and I've heard about celary fields but haven't been myself.

Again, more touristy, but the Ringling museum is also a lot of fun, and free on Mondays I think. They have a circus museum! And the grounds are so pretty.

There are also frequent art fairs or crafts sales, you'd just have to look at the specific time you're coming.

Just don't expect night life, the lights go out at 8pm here

"Fun is a tough word . Define it a little more of what y’all like to do.

“Unusual stores”- The bazaar on apricot ,
Weekend Flea market off Tuttle,
Dawson’s vintages . Red barn flea market (Bradenton )

“Best places to shop” - depends , UTC is a massive shopping area that has pretty much every chain you can think of . Ellenton outlets aren’t far away. St armands but def touristy .

Spas -Lspa , The Met (mixed reviews, also owners are cheap and don’t tip delivery people )

Fun? Play some golf , fish , bar hop, kayak, relax on the beach, go to museum, find a shitty live band to listen to, go to a spring training baseball game, sit and watch people try to figure out a roundabout , bike the legacy trail, check out some of the nice parks , rent a boat, catch a movie at cinnebistro , bahi hut, go visit your parents , pool hop the nice rooftop hotels ,
Take your dog to 17th st dog park to get bit by another dog, van Wezel show, axe throwing , try to purchase a house but realize your income is 11% higher than 2 years ago but home prices are 37% higher , deep sea fishing charter , Labarge booze cruise , fight over parking at the beach.

People need to realize that superfund sites exist, and how it comes to be that taxpayers are paying for corporate waste cleanup for decades to come.  It is a great example when voters vote for those who believe profit over the environment.

Here are list of superfund sites in Sarasota County.

https://www.homefacts.com/environmentalhazards/superfunds/Florida/Sarasota-County.html

:What are Superfunds?

Superfund: A Superfund site is any land in the United States that has been contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a candidate for cleanup because it poses a risk to human health and/or the environment.

NPL Superfund: The National Priorities List is a list of the most hazardous waste sites that have been identified by Superfund/ CERCLIS where long-term remedial response actions can only be conducted.

Superfunds can be sub-classified as:

Active: A non-archived Superfund site at which site assessment, removal, remedial, enforcement, cost recovery, or oversight activities are being planned or conducted under the Superfund/CERCLIS program.

Archived: A Superfund site that has no further interest under the Federal Superfund Program based on available information and is no longer part of the CERCLIS inventory.""",t2_9gajflvy,sayaxat,0,1647613335.0,0,t1_i15mpwj,i15mpwj,True,[deleted],t3_th1p4n,https://www.reddit.com/r/sarasota/comments/th1p4n/a_quick_reminder_that_ron_desantis_is_anti/,"A quick reminder that Ron DeSantis is ANTI environment (and supporting documentation).

"Wow. 

Lots of liberties taken here in my absence. 

As long as we are talking about common mistakes made, we should discuss assumptions. 

It’s sad that my 25 years of activism, labor, community involvement, education, and straight up efforts to raise the bar for the nation on sustainable construction is instantly neglected in favor of an assumption on who I voted for in a single race that had exactly ZERO impact on the current state of Sarasota, or my departure. 

Humanity is doomed. And, it is not because of who voted for who. 

Show me what you have done for this place, for your community, for your corner, show me your sacrifice, and then you can judge me.

Not that it’s your business, but I am an independent. 

Sarasota’s problems are non-partisan and have nothing to do with state politics. This town has been sold out to development interests by the left and the right. 

Growth is inevitable, and as much as I don’t like it, I accept it. My problem, as I tried to voice in this interview, is that in the process of that growth we have wiped away the three things that give a place it’s identity: The people, The natural environment, and The historical built environment. 

None of these things happened as a result of partisan politics. In fact, it is more likely that partisanship actually prevented anyone from stopping it. 

As long as people pretend they can vote in one direction and fix this problem, we are doomed. Want to fix it? Take action.

"This is false information. What you are talking about is in regards to the November vote , which continues the tax that we have had in place since 1989.

For anybody wondering this has NOTHING to do with the tax vote a few weeks ago . The vote a few weeks ago was for the school referendum that  provides additional funds for our school district . Our district which is one of only ones in the state with an “A” rating the last 17+ years .
