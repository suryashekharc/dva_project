"MINOT, N.D. — As the North Dakota Republican Party holds its state convention, the last event in what has been a bruising and divisive reorganization and endorsement process, we can expect a lot of calls for unity.

Former Gov. Ed Schafer, celebrating the 30-year anniversary of his election to office which kicked off the modern era of NDGOP dominance, will address convention delegates and is expected to speak to some of the dysfunction that has plagued the party.

""I believe he’s bringing a message of unity,"" Erik Nygren, chairman of the District 25 NDGOP, told the Wahpeton Daily News . ""That’s the theme of the convention and I hope that’s the spirit everyone has going into this.""

I have an enormous amount of admiration for Schafer, and would never bet against his ability to bring people around to his fundamentally humane and decent approach to politics, but I wonder how fruitful unity efforts will be when it's not at all clear what Republicans would be uniting behind.

What does it mean to be a Republican in 2022?
Does anyone have a good answer?

Disgraced former President Donald Trump represents the fault line for Republicans. On one side are his loyal disciples, on the other are those who never liked him, or who only supported him because the alternative was Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden.

 North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven and his family celebrate on stage after he received the North Dakota Republican Party's endorsement at its 2022 state convention on April 2, 2022, in Bismarck.

For one side of this divide, support for Trump is a litmus test. If you support him, you're a capital-T, capital-C True Conservative, and if you don't, you're a Republican-In-Name-Only.

But what traditional conservative values does Trump represent?

Fiscal discipline? The pandemic-era economic interventions so many Republicans are today touting as cause of today's inflation headaches began under the Trump administration. Remember his calls for $2,000 checks to every American ? And the national debt grew more in four years under Trump than it did under eight years of his predecessor Barack Obama.

Is conservatism about patriotism? How do we square that with Trump's toadying for Vladimir Putin, including his recent call on the Russian despot to help him smear his political opponents.

Do conservatives stand for decent and moral behavior? Tell that to Donald ""grab 'em by the p----"" Trump. Or the people chanting ""Let's go Brandon"" in church.

Schafer himself told me during a recent interview that part of what inspired him to endorse incumbent Sen. John Hoeven over his primary challenger Rick Becker was the ""nastiness"" of Becker's very Trumpy campaign.

I would like to see Republicans unite because, despite it all, I still see the GOP, both in North Dakota and nationally, as the best (if deeply flawed) vehicle for advancing conservative principles.

But I'm afraid the Trump era has led many Republicans, including many of those who scream the loudest about conservative principles, to forget what that means.

The GOP is going through a shift, and I'm not sure there can be unity until that's over, and there is some degree of consensus over what the party stands for again.",t2_z7oon,not_medusa_snacks,0,1649001054.0,0,t1_i38h6uq,i38h6uq,True,not_medusa_snacks,t3_tussjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tussjh/port_unified_behind_what_exactly/,"Port: Unified behind what, exactly?",/r/fargo/comments/tussjh/port_unified_behind_what_exactly/i38h6uq/,1,r/fargo,0,1

"WEST FARGO — At least one person got hurt at a storage unit fire in West Fargo. The fire was called into firefighters at 2:32 p.m. Saturday, April 2 for a building at 650 2nd Avenue NW.  
  
Video from witnesses show flames filling up the inside of the large storage facility with a great deal of smoke pouring out. WDAY Photojournalist Finn Harrison said the smell of the fire was noticeable from several blocks away. It took crews at least an hour to get the flames put out.  
  
West Fargo Fire Chief Dan Fuller told WDAY News in a press conference there were squatters inside the storage unit when the fire started. They believe a space heater might be to blame but are still working to clear out hot spots so they can investigate.  
  
According to a press release from the West Fargo Fire Department, nobody was found at the scene upon arrival, but the department was notified that individuals were treated at a local hospital for burn injuries.

"I think any GOPer that is trying to distance themselves from Trump, like Port, is too little, too late. He also makes a flimsy ""no true Scotsman"" argument by trying to separate out Trump Republicanism vs. Non-Trump Republicanism, when they're really the same thing. The only difference is that Trump was saying the shitty-under-the-breath parts GOPers mutter quietly to themselves, out loud for everyone to hear. 

If anything, Trump is the pinnacle of conservatism, but is a looser, louder cannon that lacks the refinement of a Reagan or (and I can't believe I'm saying this) a Bush.

"So let me get this straight.

You want to ask strangers on the internet, none of whom know you, to co-sign a lease on an apartment for a year.  At average market rates, that's probably 7000-8000 dollars.

Now, we all know that the only people who need co-signers are people with shit credit.  So, you already have a history of not paying your debts.

So you think that you can get a stranger to co-sign for you, and potentially be on the hook for several thousands of dollars when you inevitably stop paying rent, and potentially damage the apartment.

"You looking for traditional Buffalo style wings?

I was born and raised in upstate NY (not far from Buffalo) and have been living in ND for about 18 years. I’ve tried tons of wings over the years and what people consider wings around here is incredibly inconsistent and sometimes laughable. 

My recommendations:

1.) Ask how they’re prepared. Lots of places bake or roast their wings instead of frying them (sometimes they just run precooked frozen wings through a pizza oven!!) and I sometimes receive breaded bone-in wings and I’m like, ummmm … no. Get that breading off of there!

2.) Specifically request that you want your wings super triple extra crispy. Wings are almost never cooked long enough around here for some reason. They’re cooked through and edible - but they’re soft and a good wing should crunch and be chewy, not all soft and mushy. 

3.) You usually have to specifically request blue cheese - ranch is the default around here. I’ve also noticed that getting your hot sauce of choice on the side can work in your favor so you can try it first and ask for something different if it sucks. Some of the fancier sauces can be really bad. Traditional Buffalo should be Frank’s mixed with butter (with added pepper extract to adjust heat) and that’s not super common. It also helps keep the wings crispy if they sit too long. 

Side note: “big” wings is not the answer either - smaller, crispy, crunchy. That’s the key to a more traditional style wing from upstate NY. 

All that said, the wings I’ve had from Sickie’s Garage in Bismarck have been the best wings I’ve had locally. I’m not sure if the location in Fargo is as good or not, but they might be worth a shot.

"> If they declined the order then that's one thing. They never agreed to it so no extortion

My understanding is that this is the vast majority of reasons why orders don't get delivered. We literally have a worker shortage and if people don't pay, then shit doesn't get delivered.

And if it is SLOW and there was no tip, it very well could be that it made its way through the app a few times because nobody accepted the job. 

> But if they accept the order and then decide to not deliver or it take their time in the hopes of more money?

I don't think people do that. They might take their time because of other reasons, but I doubt anybody is doing that in the hopes of more money. If they are slowing down and providing worse service in the hopes of a better 'tip', they are doing work wrong. lol.

"Think about it this way though... the difference of effort between a $10 order and a $40 order is probably negligible from a delivery standpoint. The order price might vary, but the gas and time and physical labor is going to be pretty close to the same. 

What are you paying for? The basic delivery cost is going to be fairly static. It's subsidizing all the orders that don't get picked up. Even if door dash (and uber) loses money as a company, don't forget that the app is going to take more than its fair share. Then, I suppose the driver might want to make some money. 

It seems like peak consumerism to have a Mcdonald's meal delivered to you anyway and it shouldn't surprise anybody that there is a premium on it.

"Dave is starting with name recognition that the rest of the field doesn't have. Nobody really gets to depend upon vote-splitting among their competition to win - it's a raw support game now (as it should be) with Approval Voting.

If someone wants to beat Dave, they're going to have to work hard for it - I'm thinking a ""win number"" of 10,000, depending on turnout. There were roughly 19,000 ballots cast in 2020 with John and Arlette getting 55% and 53% of those voters to vote for them, respectively. Tony Grindberg was a close third place with 49% of those ballots approving him, falling short of Arlette by fewer than 700 votes.

There was a huge jump downward to the fourth place finisher (Ed Krystosek with 20%) who, like the rest of the field at the time, was comparatively an unknown (and the pandemic obviously didn't help them become known between the post-winter thaw and election day). One could argue that Ed, for example, had a ton of ideological overlap with Tony Grindberg, yet Tony received over 5,000 more votes than Ed. I chalk this up to name recognition more than anything else.

Right now the commission race has one known (Dave) and a ton of, again, comparative unknowns. If you want someone else to win, make sure you help them raise awareness and gain as much approval as possible from the voters.

Knocking doors, getting your friends and family to vote, these things matter in races like this.

"We did get a new mayoral candidate today and she may be the worst candidate in history

Entitled stay at home mom living on the Rose Creek golf course who wants to beautify Fargo. She says Jesus told her to run. Her name is Karen Sheri Fercho

I've seen her at zoning meetings and she has a big case of NIMBY when it comes to low income apartments who make her beautiful Rose Creek Golf Course home look ugly. She doesn't want those filthy peasants to live close to her and if they do, at least make the apartments look nicer. She's so upset by them that Jesus told her to run for mayor 

Just what we need. Am entitled Karen who thinks the biggest problem Fargo is facing is the fact we don't have nice enough nice looking apartments and we need to have more design standards to increase the cost

"yup. And these companies literally lose money. Every ride is subsidized by investors. So... if a person happens to be fortunate enough to own a retirement account or an index etf through robinhood... any one of us might be paying for the rides.

Think about that. Every order costs more than the customer pays. If anybody is getting a deal, it is the orderers. Well, and more so the executives and early investor types. Of course, the companies offload labor costs and expect the customers to fill the void of not paying reasonable wages by way of a 'tip'. 

And they have many in this thread convinced that it is a 'tip' and not a necessary subsidy to make it economical for a driver to do the job.

"That isn't actually how it works, or at least how I understand it.

Your job gets offered to someone. They can either accept it or not accept it. If they choose not to accept it, Door Dash ups the anti and reoffers it until it either gets accepted or they cancel the order.

So, as I understand it, the driver has very little to do with that part. If the bid for the driver's time isn't good enough, it just won't be filled unless you are lucky.

Nobody has any obligation to you or your food unless the delivery is accepted. It is nobody's job to bring you your food if they don't want to. 

Also, it might be a wee bit dramatic to call delivering your Gordita colder than you would like anywhere near 'force or threats.' lol.

"Not really extortion.... it is the free market where the platform (uber/door dash) just connects all the parties and lets everyone decide if they want to participate.

For you to find someone to work for you, you just have to pay them enough. Like any employee or contract worker anywhere... if you don't pay them enough, they won't do it. The person who is ordering is entering the free market for delivery and competing for someone to do the job you are requesting. You are trying to hire someone.

I mean, in the old days, I could put an ad in the paper and ask for someone to deliver me food for $1. Nobody would reply. Next week, bump it up to $100. Someone will probably call.

"I think the mistake you are making is that the 'tip' is really only partially a tip. It is also a BID. Door dash is basically a bidding system where the higher the bid, the more likely your food will get delivered. 

There is a tipping component to these delivery transactions, but my understanding is that the drivers are somewhat able to estimate what the floor is on any given delivery.

After that, it comes down to the market. If a driver gets a ride where they know it is some cheese ass McDonalds #1 and it doesn't look like there is a tip, they might not take it because they know there is a better one that will be next. The risk is not worth the reward.

And I don't blame the drivers. They are a small business and have to figure out risk vs reward. I am guessing many have been burned enough times to know what they will accept. Unless they accept the job, they have zero responsibility to both you and door dash. That is the system that Door Dash/Uber set up and that customers sign up for. 

That said, there is a near zero chance I am using door dash to order some small thing from a fast food place.",t2_347p1,cheddarben,0,1648676747.0,0,t1_i2rpwp3,i2rpwp3,False,Ruben_on_the_Red,t3_tsd8cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tsd8cd/delivery_tip/,delivery tip,/r/fargo/comments/tsd8cd/delivery_tip/i2rpwp3/,4,r/fargo,0,4

If you live in Osgood and order from someplace downtown, you need to tip at least $10 for the time and miles it’s going to take to do the order. 
If you think “tip baiting” is the solution on Uber eats (putting a large tip, then lowering it once you receive your order), the driver is going to write down your name and address, and never accept one of your orders again.

"We are in competition with other cities for workforce and without people, we won't attract new businesses. To attract and retain people, I want to see a City Commission that makes the area one where people want to live

Housing is huge. We need all sorts of housing from affordable to market rate to new construction houses to incentives to fix up old houses. We could cut some of the regulations that make new homes more expensive to build. Example: Houses have to be built up to a certain level now due to past flooding potential. With the diversion, those won't be necessary. So cut regulations like that to build new homes for cheaper. Also encourage and incentivise all these run down rental houses near NDSU to be turned into single family houses. I would also like to see more density. I hate these short strip malls along busy roads that take up entirely too much land

If you want people to live here, we need to make it an entertaining enough place where people want to live here. That means we need stuff to do that improves quality of life. Here are things I think would make the area more ""entertaining.""

1) Fund the FM Greenway. That's going to take leadership to work with the state and possibly federal government. Woudn't it be cool to have 30 miles of uninterrupted walking, hiking, biking, horse trails, ATV, cross country ski and snowmobile trails? This would add fishing piers and campsites too [https://fmmetrocog.org/FMGreenway](https://fmmetrocog.org/FMGreenway)


2) Our concert facilities are over due for a makeover. The Fargodome needs upgrades (wider concourses, bathrooms, wifi) and an attached convention center could double as a concert facility. The Civic needs to either be remodeled or demolished and replaced with a performing arts center. Or they need to build something new along the river. Reality is these facilities drive events that drive people to the city. They stay in hotels and spend money at local businesses. We don't have mountains or other cool shit to drive tourism so we need to create it. Also why not give the Fargodome a budget so they can offer some guarantees to poach some major concerts away from Sioux Falls or Grand Forks?

"West Acres has survived the loss of Sears and Herberger's. Not due to the mall sucking, but more of a national mass chain store bankruptcy exit. At the end of the day, they will end up post covid very strong with more space than they had to begin with. They will own the Herberger's building and build it 6 stories tall with retail, office space and apartments. Had they owned it to begin with, had it not had asbestos or if Covid hadn't hit, it would have been an At Home store. 

The national landscape of retail is crazy now

Sears once had 3500 stores. 19 remain.

Herberger's had 250 stores and it's primary company had 1,000 stores. 0 remain.

If you think about how much empty retail space that created nationally, it's nuts. That's 4,500 mall anchor stores that closed 

Most malls flat out couldn't fill the space and went the way of the Moorhead Center Mall. It's still projected that 1 in 4 malls will close in the next 5 years, but West Acres won't be one of them. That's because they put money into the mall.

"The Article:

September 18, 2019 12:19 PM , FARGO — A verbal confrontation that occurred before the fatal shooting of Jason Halvorson, a local food truck owner, in June might have been racially charged, according to information provided during a court hearing on Wednesday, Sept. 18.

Halvorson, a white man, was shot multiple times at about 1 a.m. on June 7, and Kareem Lee Byrd and Charles Edward Harris III, both black men, were later charged in connection with the killing. Those close to Halvorson told The Forum they don't believe he would have said anything racially insensitive.

""That's not the way Jason is — he's not prejudiced,"" said Michelle Rohrich, Halvorson's cousin, adding that she was shocked when that information came up during Wednesday's hearing.

Kate Holten, Halvorson's fiancee, also attended the hearing, and she doesn't believe Halvorson said anything racist. ""I've never known him to have a hateful bone in his body,"" Holten said.

Byrd appeared in Cass County District Court on Wednesday where he pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder . Harris, 30, who faces the same charges as Byrd, 20, pleaded not guilty in August .

Joshua Loos, a Fargo police detective, testified in court Wednesday and outlined the details of the investigation. According to Detective Loos: Several witnesses near the crime scene reported hearing gunshots. Authorities found seven 9 mm shell casings at the scene.

One witness told authorities he was walking his dog along Sixth Avenue North when he encountered two men and had a brief conversation with them. The witness said he saw the two men walk toward where the food truck was parked and that he lost sight of them at that point. The witness told police he heard gunfire soon afterward.

Some time after the shooting, a Clay County sheriff's deputy positioned near a bridge between Moorhead and Fargo spotted a minivan carrying a passenger who matched the description of a suspect.

Authorities pulled over the minivan. Among the passengers in the van were Byrd and Harris. Police searched the van and found a backpack containing a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun and a .22 caliber revolver.

Loos said that when interviewed by police, Byrd said he and Harris were involved in a verbal confrontation with Halvorson and that, according to Byrd, Halvorson said some “racially motivated” things.

Loos testified that Byrd told police they went to Harris’ apartment to retrieve the guns before returning to the food truck and shooting Halvorson. Byrd told police he used the .22 caliber revolver and alleged that Harris used the 9 mm semiautomatic in the shooting, according to Loos.

While Loos didn't elaborate on the exact nature of the comments made during the confrontation, he said Byrd did become emotional during the police interview and that Byrd told detectives some of what was said brought up negative feelings regarding his upbringing.

Rohrich and Holten told The Forum that Halvorson is not the kind of person to instigate a confrontation, and Rohrich said that even if he were involved in a verbal confrontation, he would not have said anything racist toward another person.

Loos testified that Harris admitted the guns found in the van belonged to him, but denied any knowledge of the shooting. Harris told police that Byrd went for a walk and, upon returning, claimed he shot someone, Loos said.

An autopsy revealed that Halvorson died from multiple gunshot wounds and that two different calibers of guns were used.

Judge Stephanie Stiel concluded there was sufficient probable cause to support the charges against Byrd, pointing to the information Byrd provided to police as well as the found shell casings that matched the calibers of the guns found in the van.",t2_g93zj,Renyx,0,1648580989.0,0,t1_i2lom7e,i2lom7e,False,selfly,t3_tr4x9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tr4x9x/i_hope_you_burn_in_hell_second_man_sentenced_in/,“I hope you burn in hell.”: Second man sentenced in fatal shooting of Fargo food truck owner,/r/fargo/comments/tr4x9x/i_hope_you_burn_in_hell_second_man_sentenced_in/i2lom7e/,7,r/fargo,0,7

Climbing gyms are great for birthday parties, dates, or just meeting people. They're a lot more social that a typical gym. Also, $60 is a very reasonable... Many gyms go up to or exceed $100/mo depending on amenities.",t2_3wtb6,greysplash,0,1648510336.0,0,t1_i2i0k7e,i2i0k7e,False,Significant-Ad-4184,t3_tqgc9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/fargo/comments/tqgc9h/new_indoor_rock_climbing_gym_opens_in_fargo/,New indoor rock climbing gym opens in Fargo,/r/fargo/comments/tqgc9h/new_indoor_rock_climbing_gym_opens_in_fargo/i2i0k7e/,18,r/fargo,0,18

I’ve only ever gone in there by myself (I’m a woman) and they’ve never screwed me over or even tried to take advantage of me. A few years back my power steering pump went out. They replaced it and I was still having problems. They spent a bunch more time and couldn’t ID anything conclusive-so they didn’t charge me a thing and suggested I try out the dealership because it might be something brand specific that they could identify easier. The dealership told me I had a leak and needed to replace my rack and pinion. I went back to Midas and they disagreed and told me not to get it replaced. They thought maybe the pump they replaced was bad, so they replaced it again, everything worked great and they didn’t charge me a penny.

It got so bad that the guy behind the desk’s face got beat red when I kept telling him. “No I will get the loan ready and to you tomorrow.” All I wanted was to secure the car with a down payment.
