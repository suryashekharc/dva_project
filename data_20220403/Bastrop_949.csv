"I also have personal experience with running WISPs in Bastrop County. Slightly cheaper but still far from simple. You still have the problem of leasing infrastructure space (water towers are popular for local WISPs here), and being in the hill country known for heavy rain makes it even more complex. You don't want an endpoint to have to jump through 4 relays to reach fiber, at that point the headache of maintaining and troubleshooting inconsistent issues between relays is too much to bother with. If you want consistent coverage over an area here, you'll need access to several towers with a direct fiber line you can use.",t2_4dt69dwx,ITaggie,0,1648582390.0,0,t1_i2ls89h,i2ls89h,False,chapsmoke,t3_tr4n7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/tr4n7h/fiber_internet_in_bastrop_county_itll_cost_you/,Fiber internet in Bastrop County?

"Also note that many ISPs, including ones bearing residential fiber options, have come and gone in Bastrop county. Unfortunately convincing your average resident of Bastrop county that they need to spend money and advocate for faster, more reliable internet is a hard sell-- I know this from experience.

Laying your own fiber is prohibitively expensive. Buying out/leasing out another company's fiber is a better option but still risky. If you want to lay your own, you'll also have to arrange for easements or an agreement with whoever owns the utility poles on your route to do so. Also not cheap, if you can even get the property owners to consider it.

"Reminds me of that time Reddit found a poorly funded daycare in (I think) Utah, and people kept showing up to 'check it out'. People were speculating that it's some kind of human trafficking center and randos started trespassing and taking pictures through windows. Turns out it's just a (licensed) daycare meant for kids in a certain low-income neighborhood that didn't run every day.

"I used to be strictly against charter schools and school vouchers. 

Now I’ve got 3 kids in the district and I’m appalled by it. If I could switch them to a charter school or use school vouchers today I wouldn’t even second guess it. 

The quality of education in this district is abysmal. They are too worried about making the football fields nice for less than 1% of the school districts population when there are desperate needs across the district the funds could have been much better allocated to.  

Mina elementary might be the only exception, but it’s starting to struggle in the last couple of years as well. None of them have been as bad as bastrop intermediate though. Kids run that place. 

And I totally get the wasted instruction time.  A boy in my youngest kids class routinely bites and hits the teacher. Whenever he starts up, the other kids have to wait in the hallway for other teachers or staff to come help my kids teacher out. She says it happens several times a month, and they are in the hallway a long time.   The district used to be good about developmental and behavioral challenges but even that’s gotten bad.

"Have you sent your kids through the schools here? Because I have. I’m a huge proponent for public schools as well, but there not always a good fit. We give plenty of funding to the county and they waste it instead of investing in paying teachers a better wage and expanding facilities. Instead what we have is 30 kids to a teacher and they have to lock down students to another classroom for an hour when a kid decides to throw his desk, which sadly they don’t have enough support for kids with special needs so the whole class suffers. They are down to 20 minutes or recess and the special areas are reduced to once a week. 

Charters are more scrutinized and have to prove their funding is being spent on the school more than public schools do. They also follow the same regulations from TEA and get their funding from the same sources. So in most cases yes go to public school.

"Elon Musk's The Boring Company wants to bring to life more long tunnels that would allow Teslas and other vehicles to bypass the traffic on traditional roads — but it's having some issues getting the facilities built that would lead to such underground development.

The Bastrop County Commissioners Court on Feb. 28 voted to table a request from the tunneling company to construct an 80,000-square-foot facility on its land east of Austin. County officials want to investigate whether some people are occupying residences on-site without a permit.

Representatives from The Boring Company are seeking approval from the Bastrop County Commissioners Court for a permit to build the warehouse and manufacturing facility at 130 Walker Watson Road, according to documents posted ahead of the Feb. 28 meeting.

Neighbors took aim at the development during the meeting, lamenting the overall lack of transparency, the addition of traffic to the area, and worries that the development was infringing upon their pastoral views and quality of life in the rural area east of Austin. One neighbor said work is going on at the site ""24/7.""

Others noted that they've seen people living in residential developments on the property and using a driveway on Walker Watson Road despite staff acknowledging they were unsure whether they have the requisite permits to do so.

""I'm going to recommend that we table this and spend a little more time ... on the existing facilities whether they are being occupied without proper permits,"" Bastrop County Paul Pape said before the tabling motion was passed unanimously.

No representatives from The Boring Company attended the meeting and the company has not responded to a request from the Austin Business Journal for comment.

Since the Austin Business Journal first reported in July 2021 that an entity tied to The Boring Company had purchased 73 acres of land, the company's intentions at the site have remained unclear.

A tent-like structure and equipment was visible from the road when a reporter visited the site Feb. 21, while the sound of construction was prevalent. On job-seeker website Indeed.com, The Boring Company is advertising Austin-area jobs such as a residential property manager and concrete production supervisor.

Documents recently obtained by ABJ show the company has been approved for permits for commercial research and development at the site. Approved plans also include 10 multifamily structures totaling 13,330 square feet, with 30 bedrooms, 20 bathrooms and 10 kitchens, as well as a basketball court. The residences are mapped for the southeast of the property, with septic tanks planned on site, according to documents.

While there are few details about what will be manufactured and stored on-site in the proposed warehouse and manufacturing facility, a site plan included in the Feb. 28 documents shows that the warehouse would be located at the center of the property. It would also connect to a parking lot with hundreds of parking spaces, a loading dock and a pavement connection to a road that exits onto FM 1209.

The Boring Company also received a letter from the local Emergency Services District and Bluebonnet Electric Cooperative Inc., which wrote that its willing to provide electricity service to the site, according to the documents.

What the company has not received is a commitment for water and wastewater services, so the permit is conditional to begin construction, with water and service being required prior to the occupation and use of the facility, according to the documents.

Officials said during the Feb. 28 meeting that the company is seeking approval from Aqua Water Supply Corp. for water services and they do not know the reason for a delay. The company has also submitted septic plans which are under review.

Pape said that he wants to review what permits the site is approved for, and if people are occupying the residences without that approval, it ""would be a violation of the permitting process.""

""We need to find out about that. If it is being done without a permit, we need to put a stop to that,"" he said.

He added that the county doesn't ""have many tools in our toolbox"" to quench a permit request, due to unincorporated areas' limited restrictions on property owners, but that it would look into it to make sure that they are using the property appropriately.

""One of the great things about living in Texas is we believe in private property rights. If you want a piece of property in Texas, you can choose whatever it is you choose to do as long as it is not illegal or immoral,"" Pape said. ""Private property owners have the right to use their properties as they wish as long as it is not against the regulations. So that is not a justification for this court to deny a developer permit. If they follow all the rules and check all the boxes, then the fact that we don't like it, it's not something we can consider.""",t2_8blyf,z0mbiegirl,0,1646739524.0,0,t1_hztqzc4,hztqzc4,True,chapsmoke,t3_t97nz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/t97nz7/request_for_boring_company_warehouse_in_bastrop/,Request for Boring Company warehouse in Bastrop tabled after some contend illegal residency on site,/r/BastropTX/comments/t97nz7/request_for_boring_company_warehouse_in_bastrop/hztqzc4/,6,r/BastropTX,0,6

"The Boring Company—Elon Musk’s tunnel construction company—is looking into a warehouse and manufacturing facility in Bastrop, east of Austin.

The Bastrop County Commissioners agenda for Monday notes that they’ll be discussing a permit the Boring Company has filed for an 80,000 square foot facility in West Bastrop. The Austin Business Journal reports the facility is at 130 Walker Watson Rd.

Plans for manufacturing at the site are unclear. The warehouse would connect to a parking lot, loading doc and a connection to a road that exits onto FM 1209. Additionally, job postings indicate that it may be used to develop “Prufrock,” a tunneling technology.

Prufrock, designed by the company, is a machine that launches from the surface and carries out underground mining. Currently, the Boring Company is aiming for a speed of 7 miles per day.

The ABJ reports that the company has been approved for permits for commercial research and development at the site. Other approved plans are 10 multi-family structures that have 30 bedrooms, 10 kitchens and a basketball court.

News of the warehouse follows other action the Boring Company has made in Central Texas, including filing permits for a research and development site in Bastrop County.",t2_5riaudqc,Hefty-Original8400,0,1645907779.0,0,t1_hyk2viy,hyk2viy,True,Hefty-Original8400,t3_t26fwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/t26fwd/a_boring_company_warehouse_could_be_coming_to/,A Boring Company warehouse could be coming to Bastrop,/r/BastropTX/comments/t26fwd/a_boring_company_warehouse_could_be_coming_to/hyk2viy/,3,r/BastropTX,0,3

I’m not super familiar with your area but maybe someone has 6+ acres?

"Pt 2: Reasons for prescribed burns like the one that preceded the Bastrop wildfire

 

Prescribed or controlled burns are fires set purposely in forest or prairie habitats to reduce the risk of larger, uncontrolled fires or maintain and restore habitats that would be periodically burned by naturally occurring fires.

The southeastern United States typically burns more acres with prescribed fires than all other regions of the U.S. combined, according to the Southern Group of State Foresters — an average of 6 million acres a year. 

“Texas has a history of naturally occurring wildfires, making prescribed burns very important to maintaining habitats on State Parks,” Bastrop State Park Superintendent Jamie Creacy wrote in a Nov. 15 notification letter distributed to residents living in the area. 

De Hoop said prescribed burns in the pine forests of the southern and southeastern United States are necessary to reduce the destructiveness of future fires. 

“The pine forest is a fire ecosystem forest,” he said. “Frequent fire is much better than a few fires, because a few fires are going to burn hotter.”

Prescribed fires every three to five years clear out pine needles, underbrush and dead or overgrown vegetation that can make future fires burn even hotter and inhibit firefighter efforts to control wildfires.

Bastrop County has been the site of at least two major wildfires in the past dozen years. The Bastrop County Complex Fire — three separate blazes that started during high winds on Sept. 4, 2011 — was one of the worst wildfires in state history, burning more than 34,000 acres, destroying 1,673 homes. In 2015, the Hidden Pines Fire burned more than three dozen homes as it cut across 4,400 acres. 

“Prevention of wildfires, and the Bastrop fire of 2011 are a classic example of why we want to do more prescribed burning,” De Hoop said.

But controlled burn crews must have an exact plan conditional on weather conditions and expected fire danger. Designated “burn bosses” in charge of executing the plan also have to be trained and certified to conduct prescribed burns.

Starns said plans for prescribed burns often differ depending on the goals of the effort. Tackling areas that are home to “woody plants” may involve conducting a burn when temperatures are hot — even if a burn ban is in place. 

At the time of Tuesday’s fire, Bastrop County did not have a burn ban in effect, but it did days earlier. 

“It just depends on what you want your goal to be and the objectives of the burn,"" Starns said.

According to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, prescribed burns in state parks are conducted by parks staff who have “extensive fire training and meet national wildland firefighting and incident management standards.” Burn bosses are also supposed to make contingency plans for and assess a fire’s “escape potential.”

The Rolling Pines Fire shows how quickly any fire can become dangerous. 

Normally, De Hoop said, community concerns center on smoke and air quality. That’s why there are usually only a limited number of available burn days, reduced even further by drought conditions or dry weather making fire danger higher than usual.

Ideal fire conditions usually include wind at 5 to 20 mph and 30% to 60% humidity, De Hoop said. 

Officials vow investigation into Bastrop County's Rolling Pines wildfire cause

Bastrop County officials say they generally have no input on state-initiated prescribed burns. 

In November, County Judge Paul Pape received a letter from parks and wildlife officials notifying him “of the department’s intent to conduct one or more prescribed burns in Bastrop State Park sometime between January 2022 and March 2022.”

Similar to the one sent to residents, the notice sent to Pape — who as an elected county judge acts as the county's chief executive and holds no judicial role — added that a site-specific plan would be made available upon request, although that document was not immediately shared when the Statesman asked for it.

Local leaders do not have the ability to stop a prescribed burn, but Pape said he would look to the state's investigation for future guidance.

“We will let the public know what the findings are,” he said. “They have a right to know what went wrong and what we are going to do to stop it from happening again.”

At the scene of the wildfire, Smith gave few other details about who would perform the review — whether it would be his own agency or an outside consultant — and what steps might be taken to prevent similar incidents.

Department spokespersons said they could not make any agency official available for additional comment. 

“At this juncture, we are fully focused on working with state and local partners to provide resources and support in those protected areas,” the agency said in a statement to the Statesman late Thursday. “As pledged, once this is accomplished, we will initiate a full review of what happened during this prescribed fire and share our findings and recommendations when it is complete.”

"Pt 1 of Article: 

At 3:03 on the morning that Texas Parks and Wildlife Department officials planned a prescribed burn in state parkland near Bastrop, the National Weather Service predicted a strong south wind of up to 20 mph, gusting to 30 mph.

Eight hours later Tuesday, just as crews started the wildfire prevention burn, weather readings at nearby Camp Swift confirmed the pre-dawn forecast: Gusts topped 20 mph and continued for seven hours as the Rolling Pines wildfire burned out of control.

That same day, the Texas A&M Forest Service, which issues daily wildfire risk assessments for each county, deemed Bastrop County an area in “moderate” fire danger, the second-lowest among five threat levels. Two hours after the prescribed burn started, the service issued a news release warning of wildfire danger, citing “above normal temperatures, wind speeds near 20 mph, aligned with freeze-cured grasses across the landscapes.”

As 250 Bastrop families were forced to evacuate, some immediately questioned the decision to do a prescribed burn as they nervously watched wind-driven flames and smoke march toward their homes.

“I don’t understand why they went ahead with the burn with the winds so high,” said Neka Walla, a Bastrop resident who was at work in Austin when her family and other residents were told to evacuate. “So many of us that live in the area could have lost everything. I am very thankful … that we had a home to come back to.”

But as evacuations were canceled and crews largely gained control of the blaze days later, the accelerated speed in which the burn spun out of control placed a sharp focus on prescribed burns, an often little-understood and sometimes controversial land management practice.

An American-Statesman review of documents and interviews with fire experts and some of those involved in the controlled burn reveal the delicate balance needed to harness the forces of wind and fire: A hearty breeze is needed to feed and move the flames, but too much wind can morph a prescribed burn into an out-of-control conflagration.

“People who don’t understand why we do them can get upset when we burn,” said Kevin Baum, a retired assistant Austin fire chief who spent years studying wildfire risks. “It’s smoky, it’s fire, and fire is scary.”

Experts in firefighting, wildfire mitigation and ecology offered differing assessments to the Statesman about the wisdom of proceeding with the intentionally set fire that day. But each agreed that prescribed burns are necessary to prevent future difficult-to-fight wildfires.

“When I first heard it was a prescribed burn, my honest reaction was, ‘No way,’” Baum said. 

While Baum said he was hesitant to judge the actions of crews without reviewing plans for the fire, “under those conditions on Tuesday, I would not have burned. Not only would I have not burned, I wouldn’t have burned a brush pile in those conditions.”

However, Niels De Hoop, a professor at the Louisiana State University’s AgCenter who specializes in fire management and prescribed burns, said his review of the National Weather Service’s forecast for Bastrop County that morning appeared to show good conditions for a prescribed burn. 

The minimum 40% humidity and initial wind speeds up to 20 mph pointed to particularly good signs, De Hoop said. Some wind — usually 5 to 20 mph — is needed to keep the fire burning in forests.

“We actually consider these ideal conditions for burning,” De Hoop told the Statesman, adding that losing control of prescribed burns is uncommon.

Heath Starns, a certified wildland fire ecologist and research scientist with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension, said that, although he had not reviewed plans for the Rolling Pines prescribed burn, he agreed that burning in higher winds can be ideal and necessary. 

“The fire has to move from one plant to the next, and your wind is a variable for how well the fire moves,” said Starns, who is president of the Prescribed Burn Alliance of Texas and chair of the Texas Prescribed Fire Council, which promotes prescribed burns as a land management practice. “You always want some wind, because you need the smoke to dissipate. You need the fire to move in a certain direction. If you have no wind at all, then you have no idea which direction the fire is going to move in.”

Ultimately, the effort that was supposed to burn about 150 acres of Bastrop State Park blackened more than 800 acres. It was 87% contained Saturday. (For reference, Austin's Zilker Park is 351 acres.)

No homes were lost, although Bastrop County Office of Emergency Management officials said flames came perilously close to neighborhoods, and, at one point, asked the area electric utility to cut power to nearly 350 customers to allow fire crews to work more safely. 

Much of the assessment of what happened will be made by a deeper analysis of a prescribed burn plan the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department had assembled with experts. Under Texas law, such plans must include a list of vegetation that is to be burned, information about topography and details about crew sizes. Officials also must notify local officials and neighbors and demonstrate their ability to ""have proper fire suppression equipment and manpower to manage the burn.""

The Statesman has requested a copy of the plan under the Texas Public Information Act, but the department has not yet made that document available. 

At the scene, however, county and state officials acknowledged that the fire did not go as planned, saying they believe embers from the prescribed burn sparked the wildfire. Texas Parks and Wildlife Department Executive Director Carter Smith added that crews were “well within the prescription of the weather parameters that were called for within the plan, and so our team felt it was safe to proceed.”

“We don’t know what happened,” Smith said. “But we will get to the bottom of it.”",t2_7kijz,melotron75,0,1643063055.0,0,t1_hu2v7n0,hu2v7n0,True,melotron75,t3_sbxugt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/sbxugt/despite_gusty_winds_bastrop_prescribed_burn_went/,"Despite gusty winds, Bastrop prescribed burn went ahead.

"This is pretty incredible footage but like u/TexasThrowDown pointed out it was most likely illegal and HIGHLY irresponsible. You can see a helicopter flying at :30s and there were possibly other firefighting aircraft already active in the area.

U/Joshuawhelms makes no mention of being a first responder…who are the only ones who can legally fly during a TFR like that. 

If Joshua was flying before the TFR took effect, which I think he was, it shouldn’t be a legal issue but more of “should’ve known better” issue. 

Also, drones have to remain in visual line of sight during operations…which means you must be able to see it. Some of this footage obviously looks like the drone is out of visual range. 

If I were Joshua, I would make sure to brush up on drone laws and I would also download the B4UFly app and check it before every flight.

"Thanks for the posts. All or most were very helpful. We're closing on a house in TV next week and I have been wondering how to best navigate the wifi. Spectrum first said the would be out on the 19th to install and then called back with a flag on the play and said they needed to send out someone to the property to see if they needed to extend service there. Have a sneaking suspicion that they're not going to be to offer service.

Question for the group - we have Verizon and can get a Verizon hotspot/home internet router but I see that only T-Mobile is mentioned here. Is Verizon service bad in Tahitian Village?

"For reference to the commenter above, this hasn’t been my experience. My wife, myself, and our 4 kids wear masks everywhere. No one has said a thing to us or dared so much as a ugly face towards us either. My kids aren’t ridiculed at all in school for wearing them either. 

It is true, there are a few loonies who fly giant dumbass flags from their cars but they are few and far between. You’d be lying if you pretended that didn’t happen in Austin too. 

None of my neighbors out in the stix off 304 fly trump flags or even get into politics. My street is varied and diverse backgrounds, we all get along, and look out for each other. 

I think you could find trouble _anywhere_ you look for it, but it my experience, bastrop isn’t this hateful red necks paradise some folks try to make it out to be. 

To your original post OP, traffic and infrastructure are issues here. If you are going into Austin, try to leave before 7:30. WEve got 2 major ways across the river and during rush hour it sucks to use either. 

If you did the online check for internet, call and confirm. They initially said they serviced my road, but upon trying to hookup service we found out they didn’t. T-Mobile whole home internet does though, and it’s been fantastic. 

Healthy food options are hit or miss. We do have a vegan bakery, if that’s your scene, and they do have some tasty stuff. 

There are a lot of chain things that sucks, but also a lot of little hidden gems. If you were craving Texmex, and all you find is taco bell and taco cabana, you’ve just not looked well enough. 

Thai food downtown is good, and several other little places are good too. But they do get tiring if you eat out a ton. 

Definitely come hang out on a weekend. Stroll downtown. Maybe catch some live music at neighbors or coppershot. Definitely walk fisherman’s park. 

If you do end up needing to work from home and have issues, there is a place downtown called the Hub. It’s a membership coop and really good place. I’ve worked many days there. Fast internet, and generally quiet environment. 

Other main issue is groceries. We’ve got H-E-B and Walmart. Both get packed during evenings and weekends. We’ve just started to do curbside and avoid it. 

My wife and I moved here from round rock. While it was a adjustment, we love it.

"Everyone mentioned the same things.  The traffic and the commute are horrid, all caused by bad drivers that won't ever get out of the left lane to let others pass.


The food is non-existent.  Yes there is a handful of places, but healthy food is out of the question generally.  You will get sick of all the food places very quickly, there is no comparison to the choices you get in Austin.

None of that stuff bothers me tremendously but the one warning I will give is to that you should go shop at the HEB, Walmart or the like, sometime after work or on the weekend.  You need to be aware of what the majority of the people are like in Bastrop.  The type of people you will encounter is drastically different.  

If you are pro-trump, love flag waving even on your vehicle and give angry looks to anyone wearing a mask, coming from Austin you will be in heaven.  But if however you have respect for your fellow human being, and a slightly higher than average intellect, you may be unhappy with your neighbors.

Give it 10years though, most of those people will be priced out by gentrification similar to East Austin.

"Moved out here in 2020 from South Austin, wish we would have explored more beforehand because we definitely would have chosen Tahitian Village over where we are now. Have friends that moved to TV two months after we moved to Bastrop and they love it. The piney woods are great, lots of wildlife and very calm and peaceful. 

Lots of good farmers markets. Eden East(which used to be located in east Austin) moved out here and have a farmers market on Wednesday’s and Saturday’s, they also have a restaurant downtown called Storehouse.  The Mennonite farmers market on Friday afternoons off of 304 is my favorite though. 

We have no problems with internet but we live in an area that gets T Mobile home internet and I love it. 

We definitely miss Austin, I was feeling lazy and wanted to use Favor to get food delivered one day and it switched between runners for like 30min before I just cancelled. So if you’re into that kind of home delivery I’d get used to not having it. H‑E‑B is pretty good out here though! 

We used to walk in our neighborhood quite frequently and it’s not really an option where I am, seems like Tahitian Village would be the same way with all of the hills, but the park is close by and it has nice trails. You can get kayaks at Fisherman’s Park and paddle down to the park in Tahitian, takes about 3 hours and is six miles. It’s really fun, we always see lots of wildlife. 

My friends never lost power or water during the freeze and they live in Tahitian, might just be where their house is located though.

"We are also in the process of moving out to bastrop,  we own 2.5 acres over on mcallister road in the pine forest area (right next to tahitian) but it's going to be a year or two before we actually build so we are going to rent in the mean time but plan to do that in the next month or two.  I'd be interested in some personal experiences as well.

We ultimately chose bastrop because its between austin (where my wife works and where her family is) and college station (where I work and where most of my family is) and we were looking for a smaller town that had most of the bigger city amenities without as much of the traffic or hustle and bustle so we think bastrop is going to be the right spot for us.",t2_zh5e4,jagowar,0,1641270261.0,0,t1_hr67ib5,hr67ib5,True,txtxyeha,t3_rv64r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/rv64r1/moving_from_austin_to_bastrop/,Moving from Austin to Bastrop,/r/BastropTX/comments/rv64r1/moving_from_austin_to_bastrop/hr67ib5/,2,r/BastropTX,0,2
"Wife and I moved into Tahitian in July. She commutes into downtown, and some days are fine and some are hell. She’s found that the earlier she leaves, the better.  The trip back can get especially rough, but that’s just 71 unfortunately. I head south, so it’s a cakewalk for me usually. 

As for Bastrop itself, we like it. She loves the river and trails. We hit the golf course from time to time.  There are plenty of places around to shop. Theater and stuff ain’t bad. Downtown is good for food and drinks, and we haven’t really had a bad time out yet.  

Our part of Tahitian near the golf course is fairly quiet most of the time, and there’s lots of deer roaming around which is cool to sit on the front porch and watch (though you’ve really gotta watch for them when you’re out early and late).  So at least for us, it’s fairly quiet and our neighbors are friendly enough.

As for the community at large, the water district takes care of the roads and…..they do ok I guess. They just made this road useable (it was horrible when I put the bid in on this place), and many of the roads are ok. When you kinda get back in the neighborhood, just driving around and checking it out, you’ll find some rough stuff. Lots of trash companies to choose from, though only one also offers recycling (we take ours to Smithville). You’ll probably be on aerobic septic, so make sure you get that looked at, depending on the age of the home. It’s not really part of a normal inspection.  You’ll need a service contract, lots of companies around, shop around and find one you like. 

Other than that, the construction they’re doing on 71 sucks. It’s kinda a cluster at the moment, and that 71/21 intersection is to be avoided at all costs.  

Good luck on things!

"I was born in Austin, but mostly raised in Bastrop. I had a lot of friends who lived in Tahitian when I was in high school, it's a very nice place. If you're looking for quiet, privacy, and like the pine forest, then it's a good move.

One thing to note is the the piney areas are the largest risk for future wildfires, which are a very real concern out there.

Another thing to consider is your relative distance to the city. Are you going to miss the easy access to a wide variety of restaurants, events, an Alamo Drafthouse, etc? There's good Mexican food in Bastrop and the downtown gets better places all of the time (still amazed that Eden East moved there), but a major city it is not. You're about 45 minutes away from downtown with no traffic. It *absolutely* will affect how often you feel like coming into the city. It was a ""big event"" for me when I lived out there.

Bastrop is close to two state parks (one is still recovering from a huge wildfire that also took out part of Tahitian Village 11 years ago) and the river, which is overall pretty awesome.

So many people lost everything.

Some are still without hope because they lost the irreplaceable.

Some were able to move on or rebuild from nothing.

I can also still feel the hug of the stranger that took us in unconditionally for months. It’s a hug that I’ll feel for the rest of my life even though she is gone now.  

I’m lucky. I look back and don’t regret any of it. The sadness is overshadowed by looking around and seeing the work we’ve done to rebuild our community has been an overwhelming success.

"BASTROP — The Rodney Reed hearing ended Thursday with prosecutors presenting witnesses in an effort to prove Reed had a history of violence toward women, including one who said he raped her in 1995. 

A defense attorney said the judge should not consider the rape testimony or the testimony of another woman who testified Thursday that Reed assaulted her in 1996, because Reed had not faced trial in either charge. 

Reed was convicted of capital murder in Stacey Stites' strangulation death in 1998 and received the death penalty. Stites' body was found by the side of a rural road in Bastrop County on April 23, 1996, with Reed's sperm in her. Before she died, Stites had planned to marry her fiancé, Jimmy Fennell, then a Giddings police officer.

Five days before Reed's scheduled execution in 2019, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals ordered that a hearing be held in state District Court in Bastrop after defense attorneys presented new evidence they said exonerated Reed.

Previously:Rodney Reed returns to court; dozens rally in Bastrop for his freedom

Stacey Stites
The hearing started July 19. Attorneys will have until Aug. 17 to write up proposed findings and conclusions of fact and then present them to the judge, said defense lawyer Andrew MacRae.

The lawyers will then make closing arguments to the judge, he said. District Judge J.D. Langley will them make his recommendations to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on whether Reed should receive a new trial, be found innocent or be executed.

Langley said he plans to ask for an extension from the appeals court on the Aug. 31 deadline for his recommendations. Langley also said Thursday that he is still considering whether to use the testimony from the women who said Reed attacked them in his recommendations.

The woman who testified Thursday that Reed raped her said she met him on some railroad tracks after she had been drinking at a party in October 1995. She said she didn't know who Reed was when he pulled her under a railroad trestle and sexually assaulted her. Prosecutor Lisa Tanner said the DNA that the victim submitted after the attack matched Reed's DNA.

Another woman also testified Thursday that Reed punched her and dragged her by the hair on Nov. 9, 1996, after she agreed to give him a ride home after meeting him at a convenience store. She said she did not know him at the time but later identified him in a photo lineup. He asked her for oral sex and she refused, she said. 

""I responded you will have to kill me before you get anything from me,"" the woman said. ""He (Reed) said, 'I guess I will have to kill you.'"" 

The woman said she kept punching Reed until she was able to escape from the truck and run for help.

During the sentencing phase of his capital murder trial in 1998, prosecutors said Reed had been considered a suspect in sexual assaults of six other women. He was only charged in one case and was later acquitted. It is from one of those cases that police had Reed’s DNA on file when it was matched to DNA found on Stites’ body.

One of the defense lawyers, Jane Pucher, said after Thursday's hearing that the defense had brought forth ""very powerful evidence"" during the hearing that Reed had a consensual affair with Stites.

Several defense witnesses testified they had seen Stites with Reed before she died or had heard her talk about having an affair with a Black man. Reed is Black while Stites and Fennell are white. 

The defense witnesses also testified they had seen Stites and Fennell fighting or had heard Fennell saying derogatory things about Stites after she was killed. A defense witness also testified that Fennell made a remark while in prison about strangling a woman. 

Fennell was sentenced in 2008 to 10 years in prison for kidnapping and inappropriate conduct with a person in custody while a police officer in Georgetown. He testified at the hearing last week that he did not kill Stites and did not know Reed.

MacRae, the defense attorney, said after the hearing that the 15 to 20 defense witnesses who testified ""had no axe to grind, don't know Jimmy Fennell and don't know Rodney Reed."" 

Debra Oliver, one of Stites' sisters, cast doubt on the testimony of the defense witnesses after the hearing, saying sometimes distant memories are ""inaccurate."" 

Oliver also said in an interview outside the courtroom earlier Thursday that ""finally the truth is out"" that Stites did not have an affair with Reed.  

Stites' daughter, Demi Nugent, also said outside the courtroom Thursday that the hearing was ""a mess.""

""We shouldn't have to keep reliving it because we are the victims,"" she said. ""Stacey was the victim and not the other way around.""

"Despite a recent “minor spike” in COVID-19 cases, Bastrop County Judge Paul Pape said he will not support asking residents who have been vaccinated against the virus to wear masks or alter their lifestyle to protect those who have not been vaccinated. 

Bastrop County had 51 new confirmed COVID-19 cases reported Monday, the highest daily total since Feb. 2 when 101 new cases were reported in the county, according to state health data. Twenty-nine new confirmed cases were reported Tuesday.

“We are not surprised by this minor spike in COVID-19 cases,” Pape said. “As more folks who have not been vaccinated are out and about, there will be more cases. We are finding that those who have been vaccinated are having mild reactions to the virus, and quickly recover without hospitalization. Those who have chosen not to accept the vaccine may suffer a more severe reaction, but our medical facilities and health care providers are well suited to respond.”

“You will recall that the initial reaction to the pandemic over a year ago was to flatten the curve,” Pape said. “That has certainly happened. If folks decide not to take advantage of the vaccine, that is their personal right. I will not support asking those who have been vaccinated to again wear masks or change their lifestyle to protect those who chose not to be inoculated against this disease.”

Pape’s stance is at odds with a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation issued Tuesday urging residents who are vaccinated against COVID-19 to again resume wearing face coverings in areas where virus infections are climbing as federal health officials say the new Delta variant is more transmissible than previous variants. 

Gov. Greg Abbott in May issued an order banning local governments from implementing mask mandates. But as virus infections climb in the Austin area, the Capital City moved into Stage 4 coronavirus guidelines, a sign pandemic conditions are again worsening, and is asking residents to wear face coverings in areas where social distancing cannot occur regardless of vaccination status. The city guidelines are not a legal requirement.

Since June 30 there have been four deaths attributed to COVID-19 in Bastrop County, according to state health data. In that same time, there have been six COVID-19 deaths in Travis County. 

Bastrop County Emergency Management Coordinator Christine Files said Monday’s daily high count likely represents the total number of cases accumulated over the weekend. The state Health Services Department did not report any new cases Sunday and it reported 32 new confirmed cases in Bastrop County on Saturday. 

Before Monday’s daily high of 51 in the past five months, Saturday’s count of 32 new cases was the county’s highest daily total since Feb. 16 when 44 new confirmed cases were reported, state health data shows.

“Anytime we have an increase in new cases it is worth taking note of and looking at how this is impacting our health care system,” Files said. “The hospitalization rate in Trauma Service O still remains low at 6.24%.” Bastrop County is part of Trauma Service Area O, which covers 11 counties in Central Texas including Travis, Hays, Williamson, Fayette and Lee counties.

As new virus cases increase locally, Bastrop County continues without a health authority after Dr. Desmar Walkes resigned in May to take a similar position with Austin and Travis County. 

Pape said Dr. Sharon Melville, the state Health Services Department’s Region 7 medical director, is the county’s resource person for COVID-19 related matters. He said there is no timeline for when a new health authority will be named but he said he will discuss the vacancy with the Commissioners Court and will ask medical workers who are interested in the position to contact his office. 

“Then, based on responses from local doctors, I will make a recommendation to the court,” he said. 

Files said the county’s Emergency Management Office receives weekly COVID-19 case reports from the state Health Services Department and it continues to inform residents on its social media pages and on the county’s coronavirus website about where they may get vaccinated. She said local emergency management officials are working with the state to organize vaccination events as requested and a couple back-to-school vaccination clinics have been scheduled for local school districts.

Files said her recommendation to Bastrop County residents is to get vaccinated.

Getting vaccinated prevents severe illness, hospitalizations and death, according to the CDC. The U.S. public health agency is urging residents who are not vaccinated to get a vaccine and continue wearing face coverings until they are fully vaccinated.

In Bastrop County, 46.2% of residents who are 12 or older are fully vaccinated and 57.9% have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to state health data. Of those 65 and older in the county, 66.4% have been fully vaccinated and 80.3% have received at least one dose.",t2_3wm5d,doggod,0,1627424945.0,0,t1_h6res0q,h6res0q,True,doggod,t3_oswst9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/oswst9/despite_minor_spike_in_covid_cases_bastrop_county/,"Despite 'minor spike' in COVID cases, Bastrop County judge says he won't support local mask recommendation",/r/BastropTX/comments/oswst9/despite_minor_spike_in_covid_cases_bastrop_county/h6res0q/,6,r/BastropTX,0,6

Neighbor bulldozed the drainage ditch for our street (it’s against our property deeds to do so) and it took a year to get it reopened up. Meanwhile my property flooded every time it rained and it causes severe damage to my property. 

The property owner finally did put a pipe in to move the water after the year of me being persistent, but they did it at an angle, so it never fully drains. We contacted the county commissioner again who basically responded with “your land sits low anyway, so deal with it. “

"After survey results from 2020 showed Bastrop County lags behind in internet access and quality of service, the county is putting federally-awarded dollars behind an effort to improve internet access and service for county residents.

During Monday’s Bastrop County Commissioners Court meeting, County Judge Paul Pape outlined several potential uses for the American Rescue Plan funding the county received from the federal government.

The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, signed by President Joe Biden in March, is designed to help the nation recover from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic.

Pape said Monday that Bastrop County has received about half of the $17 million it was awarded in the American Rescue Plan. All of the American Rescue Plan money will have to be spent by the end of 2024.

Pape specified three major areas of need due to COVID-19 that the county's funding will address: early cancer screening and detection, the creation of a county health and wellness center in a low to moderate income area and improving broadband internet access in Bastrop County.

Pape cited the lengthy process of assessing the county's insufficient internet access and service as a reason why some of the federal award will be devoted to internet in the county.

“We have actually a very highly developed picture of where the needs are in Bastrop County,” Pape said. “We’ve met more than once with private purveyors of retail broadband service, and they’re all ready to continue work with us as we develop a plan to help with the infrastructure that would allow them to provide that last mile of service to our residents.”

The results of the 2020 survey, based on 3,624 Bastrop County households that responded to a voluntary survey last year, found that 60.5% of respondents said their current internet service doesn’t meet their needs.

The survey was conducted by Connected Nation Texas, a nonprofit that works to support all residents to leverage broadband, and its results were revealed in March 2021. 

The internet survey project, born from a partnership between the county and local nonprofit Bastrop County Cares and also funded in part by other groups such as St. David’s Foundation and the Hogg Foundation, came to fruition after the need for broadband internet service was heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic.

“We learned during that Connected Nation survey there were hotspots all over the map, but there are large sections of rural Bastrop County that don’t have any, not just poor, they don’t have any broadband access,” Pape said Monday. “We know that for education, health purposes, job purposes, we need good broadband service.”

The report and survey findings — which included feedback from a variety of internet users in the county, such as domestic users, agricultural users, educators and health care providers — revealed a pattern of broadband shortcomings that include high cost for service, slow internet speeds and unreliable internet service.

The survey found the average internet download speed among households in Bastrop County is 23 megabits per second, compared to 37 megabits per second in other communities recently surveyed by Connected Nation, and that 23% of respondents in Bastrop County didn’t have an internet connection, with the two main causes being high cost and lack of service availability.

Rolling out improvements

The Commissioners Court on Monday unanimously approved an agreement with Connected Nation for continued broadband improvements with financial support through the county’s American Rescue Plan funding.

The agreement was approved by all commissioners except Precinct 2 Commissioner Clara Beckett, who didn’t attend the meeting for reasons that were not immediately known. 

According to the agreement, the Bastrop County Broadband Task Force — a group that includes residents, county government officials and Bastrop County Cares — asked for funding for a telecommunications consultant and to develop a countywide strategic broadband plan.

The cost for the consultant should not exceed $49,500 and will be contracted with Connected Nation, while the cost of developing the strategic broadband plan is currently unknown, according to the agreement.

Adena Lewis, the county’s director of tourism and economic development, introduced the agreement to the Commissioners Court and said other funding sources like federal, state and private grants will also be pursued to better develop the county’s broadband internet system.

“We’ll still be very much dependent on private companies to come and invest in Bastrop County. That’s going to be the critical piece,” Lewis said. “What we’re trying to do is make it as comfortable and easy, give them as much knowledge as possible, for how they can do that in Bastrop County.”",t2_3wm5d,doggod,0,1625094737.0,0,t1_h3ma7rg,h3ma7rg,True,doggod,t3_ob8ytq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/ob8ytq/bastrop_county_to_tap_american_rescue_plan/,Bastrop County to tap American Rescue Plan funding to boost internet service for residents,/r/BastropTX/comments/ob8ytq/bastrop_county_to_tap_american_rescue_plan/h3ma7rg/,2,r/BastropTX,0,2

"Bastrop is severely underserved and underwhelming when it comes to internet.  The downtown/city area and newest subdivision have mostly Spectrum, while anything even slightly rural is a wild toss up, with very few wired options available to most.

I live 6 miles outside the city, and the fastest wired internet is 3Mbps (truly 1Mbps) from suddenlink.  A small neighborhood across the road has Spectrum, though; and 4 blocks the other direction has only WISP and not even 4g/5g well enough to call it broadband.

I'm using a handful of prepaid boost mobile phones with a 30GB data limit per each and just rotate them out as I use them up.  
I get around 10Mbps average, peaking at 20-30Mbps at quiet hours 12Am-6Am'ish. 

In summary, depending on where you buy, your internet experience has a higher-than-normal chance to completely suck.  You can google stuff like ""broadband coverage areas in bastrop"" to get a rough idea, or check the FCC maps; but those are woefully inaccurate.

"Cameron Cox, the Bastrop Economic Development Corporation’s CEO whom the board fired March 12, filed a whistleblower lawsuit last week seeking unspecified damages against the city of Bastrop, Mayor Connie Schroeder, the economic development corporation and the corporation’s chairwoman, Kathryn Nash.

Cox claims in his suit that the BEDC’s board began taking adverse action against him — and ultimately fired him — days after he sent an email to Bastrop City Attorney Alan Bojorquez requesting an opinion on whether it was legal for Schroeder, who also serves on the BEDC’s board, to ask him to endorse a candidate for City Council. 

“Was it legal for Mayor Schroeder to call me on December 16th, 2020 and ask me to endorse Jimmy Crouch for council or mayor, and then preface that statement with (Dock) Jackson running for mayor and that it concerns her because he is pro Black Lives Matter?” Cox’s Feb. 19 email to Bojorquez states. 

According to emails obtained by the Advertiser, Charles Zech, the BEDC’s attorney who was copied in Cox’s Feb. 19 email, replied that he would defer to the city attorney for an opinion. Cox previously told the Advertiser that Bojorquez did not reply to him. 

Cox told the Advertiser during an interview shortly after being fired that Schroeder asked him to endorse Crouch, who is facing Cheryl Lee for the open Place 4 seat. Cox said Schroeder wants Crouch to win that council seat and then run against Place 5 Council Member Dock Jackson for mayor, if Jackson pursues the city’s highest elected office. 

Cox said Schroeder told him she is considering a run for Bastrop County judge and would need to step down as mayor should she file her candidacy for that office. He said Schroeder told him that Jackson might run for mayor and she would like Crouch to challenge him because Jackson supports the Black Lives Matter movement. 

Schroeder, however, has denied asking Cox to endorse anyone for office. 

“There is no truth to Mr. Cox’s accusations,” Schroeder told the Advertiser on March 12. “I enjoy a mutually respectful relationship with Council Member Jackson and appreciate his years of service to our community.”

Schroeder said she spoke with Cox by phone on Dec. 16 to discuss the timing of a joint meeting between the council and BEDC and did not ask Cox to endorse any candidate for City Council, as there were no candidates for office at that time. 

The window to file for a seat on the council opened Jan. 13. 

But Cox, an attorney-turned-economic developer who took notes during his call with Schroeder, recalls Schroeder telling him: “Jimmy Crouch is planning to run for City Council and what I would like to see is for him to beat Cheryl Lee. She is currently running and Jimmy may run against her. And if he wins, he can run against Dock (Jackson) for mayor.” 

Schroeder did not return an emailed request for comment on Friday. 

Zech, the BEDC’s attorney speaking on behalf of the defendants, told the Advertiser in an email Monday: “The city, the Economic Development Corporation and the named individuals disagree with both the factual assertions and the legal validity of the claims made by Mr. Cox in his pleadings. However, since he has chosen to litigate these matters, out of respect for the court system, we will not be trying this case in the media.”   

Zech said that “at the appropriate time, we will be filing responsive pleadings with the court spelling out the defendants’ factual and legal responses to his claims.”

The BEDC board unanimously voted to fire Cox on March 12 under Section 12 of his employment contract, which states that if the BEDC fires him without cause, he will receive six month’s severance pay including insurance premiums.

In his suit, Cox states the city told him on March 23 that his health insurance benefits were being terminated and not carried out in accordance with his contract.

Cox was fired four months after receiving a glowing annual performance review and a 10% pay raise from the BEDC’s board. 

On March 15, Nash declined to say why the board fired Cox other than to say the board “reluctantly” accepted Cox’s request to exercise Clause 12 of his employment contract. 

Cox, however, told the Advertiser that he did not want to leave his job until recently, when the board began calling special meetings to discuss his employment contract and search for cause to fire him. 

Before being fired, the BEDC’s board had only held two meetings since Cox’s Feb. 19 email to Bojorquez and Zech — on March 5 and 11 — both of which were special meetings called to discuss Cox’s employment contract.",t2_3wm5d,doggod,0,1617232900.0,0,t1_gsyyfif,gsyyfif,True,doggod,t3_mhidro,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/mhidro/was_it_legal_ousted_bastrop_edc_chief_files/,"'Was it legal?': Ousted Bastrop EDC chief files whistleblower suit against city, EDC, mayor, chairwoman",/r/BastropTX/comments/mhidro/was_it_legal_ousted_bastrop_edc_chief_files/gsyyfif/,6,r/BastropTX,0,6

"Idk between Bastrop and Austin I'd say Austin's better about it, but maybe it's just the areas I frequent. That said in my experience around Bastrop yeah I'd say about 2/3s of the population wear their masks. Honestly I'm not so much worried about the population wearing masks as I am against the city council, and Bastrop's government officials. I mean city council was 4-1 on lifting the mask mandate, and their whole reasoning was, why go against the governor? Idk, cause he's a dumb ass who's politicizing a deadly pandemic and lifting the mandate which will probably result in this whole situation being drawn out way longer because he wanted to score brownie points with anti mask Texans affected by our shit electrical grid, cause Texas doesn't want to follow the guidelines like the rest of the country. That's not to say the rest of the country is right either though, our whole country's electrical grid is like 10 years behind where it should be, and if anything goes wrong the whole country could easily lose all power, and boom just like that our whole country is fucked.

"We bought in Feb 2020. We were retiring but I did not want to be in an area booming like the newer sales communities or the older Tahitian area. The one or two homes I looked at in Tahitian had new slabs poured way too close over the new fence. This was a mix of junky and nice and older and new homes. It didn't appeal. 
The new subdivisions going up on 71 between B and Austin to make a quick buck off the boom were just as bad, no character homes, iffy small lots, listen to circular saws and hammers all day Saturday and weekdays. 
Why go to Bastrop and get a postage stamp lot with a cracker jack house just like the neighbor's place? You can do that anywhere.

We eventually passed up the big companies and worked with our lovely local realtor. The MLS is the same, IMHO, but the person who lives here for years knows the area ( I still will call her and ask advice on food, contractors, bluebonnet places etc.) 

We ended up out past the Roadhouse Bastrop on 21 about a mile out. The lake is very close. The state park is very close. We vote at the fire house out here. The spot cost us no more than the iffy places in Tahitian Village. Our place is some 25 years old, on a half acre and nice, quiet, friendly folks. Just what we wanted. As it is an older home I am spending some extra on replacing windows and upgrading the porches etc. But, I can use what I want. Ringer Windows out of Taylor makes a product to be used in Tx sun and weather. New construction seemingly uses the cheapest Chinese home depot windows they can put in and still get a sale. I yanked the heat pump and blower after we got here. It had not been upgraded since the 90s. I was able to get high efficiency / high quality / and low maintenance energy star units. 
The AC at a new home will be just good enough to get you out of warranty. 

Warning: Do NOT expect a single Home Warranty Company to do a single damn thing at all for you. They will chisel and evade and when they are FINALLY forced to send a repairman to your home, expect some company with 1 or 2 star ratings out of a town a hundred miles away. Houston / San Antonio contractors who argue and terrorize very old people into paying out of pocket to do the job or pay them to leave. Home Warranty is a huge rip off and will NOT protect your purchase. They WILL hound you to sign up again no matter how many ways you block them, though. (Looking at A------n Home Warranty here. When I was asked by my old realtor at the home I sold, if I wanted to provide $500 for a warranty contract on sale, I asked why. Asked did any company ever do anything? They finally said nope. It is just a sales gimmick to make the new buyer feel they have some protection.) 

Now, IF you live on this side of Bastrop you have several ways to Austin. 71, 21, 969, 290. Give it an hour to North Austin and 45 minutes to South Austin. 

Prices for existing homes are fair still. (The i-35 corridor of cities between South A and San Antonio all have very high prices.)     
Bastrop Traffic WILL slow down for about 20 minutes around the bridge over the Colorado at rush hour. Downtown is quaint and nice folks. Get an account at the local bank here as Chase and Bank of A is not allowed here it seems.  We make transfers from the local to and from PNC and Cap One 360. That works fine. 

I like it here. We used to drive through as kids back in the 70s and then it was a small redneck town. Now, they don't mind if you look like Willie Nelson or have a Democrat's sign in the yard.

Thank you for the response though. I wish there was another word for racist by the way. Half the time, I feel the people watch a news source and what they see they depicted everyone in that particular race to be like.

"The Bastrop City Council approved a resolution during Tuesday night’s City Council meeting allowing the Bastrop Police Department to apply for a grant to upgrade the department’s body-worn cameras for all officers.

The grant, offered by the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, is for $72,785 and does not require matching funds from the city.

Grant funding would cover 28 new body-worn cameras for the department, along with a three-year no fault warranty and three-year licensing for the cameras. 

“We have body-worn cameras currently, but those are starting to kind of meet their life expectancy,” Bastrop Police Chief Clint Nagy said during Tuesday’s meeting. “We’re starting to have to replace those every once in a while.”

Nagy added that hardware and software for the body-worn cameras, as well as a system that would help videos from the cameras integrate with the department’s reports management system, would all also be covered by grant funds.

The 28 new body-worn cameras would be enough for all of the department’s officers and Bastrop’s animal services and code compliance officer, with one spare camera remaining.

“The (Bastrop Police) Department is committed to providing transparency to the community and ensuring our police officers are acting professionally and appropriately,” stated City Council documents about the body cameras.

“Body-worn cameras allow for accurate documentation of officer-public contacts, arrests and critical incidents. They also serve to enhance the accuracy of police reports and testimony in court,” the documents stated.

If the Police Department is awarded the grant it will use the money to purchase the WatchGuard V300 body-worn camera system. The cameras offer distortion-free video at up to 1080p resolution, an electronically-adjustable lens and is enabled with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.

All of Bastrop’s sworn police officers are currently assigned their own body-worn camera. The department began using WatchGuard body-worn cameras in 2016. 

The extended warranty for those 2016 cameras will end in October and they will no longer be manufactured.

Those two factors helped drive the department to pursue replacing the existing cameras with a new and improved model.

According to the proposed grant application the police department will submit, last year chief administrators from the department had “in-depth and serious conversations with the public” about the role of body-worn cameras in policing following the death of George Floyd. 

Those conversations led the police department to conclude that “the overwhelming majority of the city of Bastrop citizens want the Bastrop Police Department to have high quality, updated, reliable and usable” body-worn cameras.",t2_3wm5d,doggod,0,1611877585.0,0,t1_gl5ygyu,gl5ygyu,True,doggod,t3_l7cu06,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/l7cu06/committed_to_providing_transparency_bastrop_seeks/,'Committed to providing transparency': Bastrop seeks grant to upgrade police body cameras,/r/BastropTX/comments/l7cu06/committed_to_providing_transparency_bastrop_seeks/gl5ygyu/,2,r/BastropTX,0,2

"The Bastrop County Monument Relocation Committee raised $18,000 after an online concert on Monday evening showcased three hours of music and messaging virtually advocating for the removal of a pair of Confederate monuments on the Bastrop County Courthouse lawn.

The concert was part of a fundraising initiative to relocate the monuments to a new home. The virtual event raised $9,000, and with a donation match offer from a foundation that works with Bastrop County Cares, $18,000 will go toward the monuments' relocation. 

The “Move Forward Virtual Music Fest” was streamed on the YouTube channel of Grace Pettis, who performed during the concert and helped organize the event along with relocation committee co-chair Cheryl Lee.

The concert was a free event with all contributions going to the committee.

Held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the concert featured nearly 20 local and national music acts who sent in recordings of songs along with messages of support for the monument relocation effort.

These messages were headlined by an appearance by Martie Maguire of the 13-time Grammy-winning Texas band The Chicks, whose 2020 music video for the song “March March"" was shown in the concert.

Maguire’s message featured an explanation of why The Chicks changed its band name last summer to eliminate association with Confederate states, while also expressing support for creating a better environment for all people in Bastrop County.

“We are so proud and happy to be supporting Move Forward Fest,” Maguire said. “It means relocating Confederate monuments and creating more welcoming and inclusive public spaces in our state.”

Lee began Monday’s event by briefly recapping the months-long process to remove and relocate the Confederate monuments — an obelisk erected in 1910 by a local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and a granite headstone erected in 1964 by the state of Texas commemorating Joseph D. Sayers, a major in the Confederate army and Texas’ 22nd governor. 

She recognized the work of the five initial leaders of the grassroots relocation movement — herself, Dock Jackson, Cheryl Reese, Madeline Eden and Aimee Cook — when recounting how the monument relocation efforts have reached their current point.

This backstory was communicated to an online audience that began with 131 live viewers, but grew to more than 300. Viewers on the event’s YouTube chat commented that they were watching the concert from not just Bastrop, but also far away places like the United Kingdom, Philadelphia and Roan Mountain, Tenn.

Most of the music acts performed two songs each, though each act also took time before their set or in between songs to comment on the removal of the monuments.

Americana and folk rock artist James McMurtry, who lives in neighboring Caldwell County, said there’s also a Confederate monument located in Caldwell County, even though the county wasn’t organized until 15 years after the Civil War.

“I hope we’re successful in this venture,” McMurtry said. “It never even occurred to me to ask why the losers in the conflict got monuments.”

Midway through the event the music was momentarily halted for a longer video submission featuring a speech from Ryan Holiday, a lecturer and author who donated $10,000 to the monument removal and relocation efforts in September.

Holiday said the presence of the Confederate flag when rioters breached the U.S. Capitol earlier this month spoke volumes about what the flag truly symbolizes.

“We shouldn’t forget it,” Holiday said of the Confederate flag. “It should be a thing that we’re all aware of, that we all know about and that we can study from and that we can learn from. But what we absolutely should not do, with our tax dollars, with our public spaces and with the monuments we put up, is celebrate that flag. Because we know what it’s a symbol of and we know what it actually is about and what it actually represents.”

One of the main participants in the concert was Pettis and her three-member folk group Nobody’s Girl. The group, along with its members — Pettis, BettySoo and Rebecca Loebe — each performed their own set.

The idea for Monday’s virtual concert came from conversations between Pettis and Lee after Pettis saw an online fundraising update from the Monument Relocation Committee.

Pettis reached out to her producer and record label, MPress, along with other music industry contacts to secure promotion and artists for the concert.

“It’s been so encouraging in such a weird, dark, scary time to just put it out there and so many of my friends and heroes have joined in the efforts,” Pettis said before her set.

Akina Adderley, an Austin-based bandleader, songwriter and vocalist, communicated the overarching concepts that all artists touched on during her pre-set remarks.

“These symbols of the Confederacy need to be studied, yes, but not venerated,” Adderley said. “They need to be investigated intentionally, not forced on the eyes of the descendants of former enslaved people as they walk by the county courthouse.

“Thank you for being on the right side of history and thank you for making Bastrop and Texas a little more welcoming to everybody.”

Monument relocation fundraising update

Following the concert Monday night, the Monument Relocation Committee touted in a tweet the $18,000 it raised.

The money collected puts the committee on the brink of its previously stated $50,000 fundraising goal.

In a post-concert video posted to Facebook, Lee thanked those who made the concert possible and those who donated, before adding that the concert video will be left up on YouTube for the next few days.

“It was more than I ever could’ve imagined,” Lee said. “I just had to get on and tell everyone how full of joy I am, sincerely, from the bottom of my heart.”

"The latest fundraising endeavor from the Bastrop County Monument Relocation Committee to generate the money needed to remove and relocate a pair of Confederate monuments on the grounds of the Bastrop County Courthouse will feature one of country music’s biggest acts.

The 13-time Grammy-winning Texas band The Chicks will be one of several local and national music acts performing during a live-streamed, virtual concert to raise funds to support the committee’s efforts.

The online concert, known as the “Move Forward Virtual Music Fest,” will take place at 6:30 p.m. Monday and will be streamed on the Monument Relocation Bastrop Facebook page and the YouTube channel of Grace Pettis, one of the performing artists.

In addition to The Chicks and Pettis, the festival lineup features notable names like Grammy-nominated blues and folk artist Ruthie Foster, Americana and folk musician Eliza Gilkyson, former “American Idol” producer and Bastrop native Ron DeShay and singer and record producer Rachael Sage, who founded the indie record label MPress Records.

Monument Relocation Committee co-chair Cheryl Lee said the idea for the concert began when she posted a committee fundraising update on an online petition to remove the monuments.

Pettis saw the update and reached out to Lee via Facebook to ask how she could help with marketing the fundraising efforts. Discussions about potential new donation platforms soon shifted to talks about a virtual concert.

Conversations about the concert began just before Christmas and within two weeks artists were signed up for it.

Pettis, who is signed to MPress, reached out to her producer and the company in addition to using her music industry contacts to secure other artists.

“She (Pettis) and I have been on the phone every other night,” Lee said. “We had maybe four people signed on before Christmas, but everyone else signed on after the 1st of January.”

Lee herself had contacts to facilitate a conversation with The Chicks, and Lee said the famed group “immediately jumped on board” with the project, even posting links to the event and the committee’s fundraising efforts on its social media pages.

Last year, The Chicks took part in a Zoom chat with sex trafficking survivors sheltering at a residential treatment facility in Bastrop County.

“We’re going to raise the money, that’s the best thing about it,” Lee said of the concert fundraiser. “The committee has been asking for donations and the community, there’s only so much you can get out of the community, so we needed to take our promotion to another level and God has just blessed us throughout this whole process.”

Monday’s virtual concert will feature original performances, new music videos and guest speakers over the course of three hours.

This will include a personal message from The Chicks along with the group’s new music video for the song “March March.”

Speakers during the event will include Lee and Ryan Holiday, a lecturer and author who donated $10,000 to the removal and relocation efforts.

The decision to have the event on Martin Luther King Jr. Day was one Lee said she thought of immediately because the big celebrations that normally happen on that day around Texas won’t be held this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

“What better way to celebrate MLK Day than by having a virtual concert and for the purpose of removing Confederate monuments,” Lee explained. “The thought of February was because of Black History Month, you could pick any day in February and do the concert, but to have it on MLK when everyone is looking to engage is something that I think is monumental.”

Lee said artists will send in live recordings and videos for the event that will be packaged together, with the committee’s fundraising link scrolling across the bottom throughout the concert. Monday’s concert is a free event with all contributions going to the committee.

“I hope everyone enjoys the concert but also remembers the purpose of the concert is to help us get the money we need to relocate the monuments,” Lee said.

Monument relocation fundraising update

Monday’s concert fundraiser comes as the Monument Relocation Committee closes in on its stated fundraising goal of $50,000.

When the committee last presented to the Bastrop County Commissioners Court in December, it listed its top three locations for a possible new home for the monuments, an obelisk erected in 1910 by a local chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and a granite headstone erected in 1964 by the state of Texas commemorating Joseph D. Sayers, a major in the Confederate army and Texas’ 22nd governor.

While the removal and relocation process for the monuments likely won’t begin until April, the committee’s main focus since that December presentation has been on raising funds for the process.

The $50,000 fundraising goal has been a longtime target for the committee and also aligns with a bid for nearly that amount from Bastrop-based Deep in the Heart Art Foundry to handle monument removal, transportation and relocation.

During that December meeting, Lee and Monument Relocation Committee Co-Chair Sharah Johnson said $30,000 is enough to fund the first and second steps of the projected five-step monument relocation process, but both committee and county officials want to relocate the monuments “in one fell swoop” without any fiscal delays.

As of Tuesday night, Lee said the committee has raised $30,013.91.

Lee also said the committee has been offered a donation match for any money raised during the concert up to $10,000 by a foundation that works with Bastrop County Cares.

With the match, the committee would only need to raise $10,000 during the concert to hit its fundraising goal.

Lee said the committee is hopeful it will receive an answer from the Commissioners Court about the new location for the monuments sometime this month, but until then the focus remains on fundraising. 

The goal for both the committee and the county remains to not use taxpayer funds in the removal and relocation process.

People interested in contributing to the relocation fund can do so on the Bastrop Confederate Monument Relocation Fund website or contact Lee or Johnson at cheryllee@sbcglobal.net or sharahjohnson@gmail.com or by phone at 512-636-0374 or 512-284-4624.",t2_3wm5d,doggod,1,1610668124.0,0,t1_gjack7n,gjack7n,True,doggod,t3_kxhzwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/kxhzwe/virtual_concert_featuring_the_chicks_to_raise/,Virtual concert featuring The Chicks to raise funds to remove Bastrop Confederate monuments,/r/BastropTX/comments/kxhzwe/virtual_concert_featuring_the_chicks_to_raise/gjack7n/,2,r/BastropTX,0,2

"It's been a long time since I've been over there so I don't know the current status, but people still talk about it like it's not a great place so...

I get what you're saying, I just made the same point about there being drug users in even the highest of places yesterday. The difference is the amount of them and the violence that comes with them being in such close proximity. Bastrop surely has less drive-by shootings in the inner part of town compared to elgin; that was what I was trying to say, more or less. Also, in Elgin at least, since COVID there's been a sharp spike of drug-related crime; I'm sure it's happening everywhere, but it definitely makes me want to move to the country.

I've never seen crime in Tahitian, but I've known people who lived there in the past and they said they'd rather live in Elgin by MLK.

"I live in Elgin, about 20 miles west of Bastrop. It's Shit. Don't move to Elgin, Bastrop or Manor if you have children and want to put them in public school. It's fucking miserably hot right now as well; and it seems to get more unbearable every year. In terms of amenities, there's plenty to do if you're willing to drive for about 30 minutes. Austin has more Restaurants and Parks than you'll ever have time to visit, bastrop doesn't have nearly as much variety, unfortunately. Where in bastrop do you plan on living? I hear the residential areas vary A LOT. Like apparently Tahitian Village is essentially a bunch of trap houses strewn about(no offense to anyone who lives there, this comes from friends who did a lot of drugs there a few years ago). Don't move to CTX if you're a recovering addict; anything you can think of is everywhere here.

Depending on where you are, your options are limited to wireless options (WISP, Satellite, LTE) and elevation/line of sight to the tower you're trying to connect to. Also natural disasters (fires, flooding) are obviously a problem out here. There's a lot of development happening all around us and we worry about worse traffic to get the places we need to go (usually into Elgin or Bastrop).",t2_7snua,tasslehawf,0,1598910320.0,0,t1_g3iqjsq,g3iqjsq,True,[deleted],t3_ik5b4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/BastropTX/comments/ik5b4g/honest_reviews_about_bastrop/,Honest reviews about Bastrop,/r/BastropTX/comments/ik5b4g/honest_reviews_about_bastrop/g3iqjsq/,2,r/BastropTX,0,2
"I currently own a home in Bastrop and spent quite a few years in New Mexico (in the Santa Fe area, so very different from Las Cruces, but I've been there a couple of times). I work and spend most of my leisure time in Austin, I bought in Bastrop purely because my money goes a lot further here than in Austin proper. The commute isn't bad, certainly not worse than living in North Austin and having to commute south or vice versa. Considering you've already done all the pertinent research, I don't really know what else to tell you. There's a lot more to do here than in Las Cruces, employment opportunities are much better here. Both places have a lot of opportunity for outdoor activities, NM having the added bonus of mountains (but again, that's mostly northern NM, not exactly close to Las Cruces). My wife feels pretty isolated here, we're mid 30s, heavily tattooed punks from outside of Texas. The vast majority of our neighbors are much older, more conservative, with extremely different interests than us, but I don't mind it so much. 
If I could do my job and get paid the same in NM, I'd absolutely choose NM, but again, that's purely talking about northern NM.

"I'm in Austin, and researched possibly moving to Bastrop instead of Austin. I chose Austin proper because the commute was going to be excessive for me.

If you're interested in owning/investing in property, I would choose Bastrop. Now's the time to buy in that area. Property values are going to skyrocket with general Austin values, Tesla moving in nearby, the works. If I were buying property I would buy in the Bastrop area.

The area is gorgeous. I love it. Forests, river, and rocks. 

It's so close to Austin that, as long as you don't have to drive in rush hours, you have the benefits of bearing near excellent music venues,  cultural events, classes, a good airport, etc.

That said, culturally Bastrop isn't for everyone. I posted here and in r/Austin several months ago to poll for opinions about Bastrop.
