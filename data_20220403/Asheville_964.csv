"Dude, they are arguing to legalize and regulate the pharmaceutical opiates…

That means people can go to the store and buy what they want. This would kill the black market for the opiates. The guy cutting the heroin with fent would stop, because there would be no money in it anymore because his market would dry up. 

You seem to be stuck on this idea that the illegal drug cartels still exists. But the drug is legal now in this argument. Are the states with legal weed still being flooded Mexican brick weed? No, because it’s legal now. Think that, but with opiates.

Edit: picture this. You live in a city where opiates are as legal as beer. You are feeling unwell and wanna catch some sweet nods and energy so you can get up and clean your house. You have 2 choices:

Choice 1 - you can go to the dispensary on your block, walk in with no wait and buy exactly 80 mg of pure oxycodone and you know exactly what is it, and how much.

Choice 2 - you can call some sketchy dealer you know, drive over to another neighborhood to meet them, sit a parking lot for a half hour cause they left you waiting, and buy some shit that everyone knows is cut with fent even though the dealer says it isn’t and has killed 5 people in that last month.

"> The same thing that stops drug manufacturers from putting fent in Percocet instead of oxycodone?

How though? The reason drug manufacturers don’t swap medicines without notifying the consumer is because that illegal.

"My flight back in January from Asheville to Boston with Allegiant was cancelled right at time for boarding…Booked another flight that day in Charlotte with Delta for double the price but at least I got to my destination. Allegiant said the reason was because they didn’t have staff. Don’t fret though because if your flight gets cancelled, they’ll give you a voucher you can use towards your next Allegiant flight. But here’s the kicker…If your next flight gets cancelled, you also lose the (non-refundable) voucher you used! 🙃

The time before that, I had a long ass flight delay back to AVL with Allegiant and they repaid me with a $10 food voucher LOL. Every time I’ve booked with them has resulted in some sort of inconvenience and flight vouchers.

It doesn’t end there, though! Here’s the best part!

Last time I bought two tickets from their site they took my money and I didn’t get any tickets. Seriously. Logged into my account to double check and it said I didn’t have any upcoming flights. Had to dispute this with my bank because customer service said they couldn’t help since there wasn’t a flight number (of course). It took me several days to try to reach someone from customer service because their wait times are usually 2+ hours. Don’t even try email— took them 4 months to reply to my last one and they responded by apologizing for the delay and asked if I still needed help. I told them yes and I still haven’t heard anything 4 months after their initial response.

Obviously, I got my money back from the bank but the whole process took about two weeks. I was pissed.

Also, like with Nevarez, the things that make them appealing to some, are also probably their biggest obstacles (independent & free from political obligations, but not run for office, no significant base of donors or any track record with voters, no significant endorsements, etc.).  

Ballotpedia provided him with a questionnaire he completed which is somewhat informative.  They also have the same Q&A with Nevarez and O'Connell.  After the bio, just scroll down:

"Rod Honeycutt's campaign started last October: the top three family-related issues he's heard most about beyond gas | inflation | finance topics (which are important):  
(1) Parents want options to get their kids caught up on their education and social development skills.  
(2) Grandparents are finding themselves raising their grandchildren, and   
(3)  7.8% of school-age children are homeschooled in North Carolina. The homeschooling community has a large presence in our area/unmet needs.  
The three listed are not necessarily related to one another. For Rod, these are ""top of mind"" topics that he's seeking more insights and solutions from people in this area. Add to the list of what matters to you.  
Note: I'm not an expert or caught up on the details so it's not worth a debate. The event is for people to engage Rod directly and have some ice cream.

"Y’all might want to consider renting a car or two. I haven’t had to use Uber in this area but I’ve heard more than one local friend say that getting a ride isn’t always easy.

Also, not implying that *your* crew would be like this, but I’ve noticed that when I’ve crossed paths with other XL-sized tourist groups enjoying our mountain home they tend to be unpleasant to coexist with. Asheville and many of its residents rely on tourism, so we’ll know how to show you a good time in a gorgeous place…but please don’t forget that you’re vacationing in a place real people live and work and not a theme park. Fifteen people on vacation-mode tend to not realize how much of an effect they have when they roll up together.

"Hi everyone! I have scoured the page for information on these subjects, but I’ve only come up with posts from 7 years ago so I thought I’d ask again! 

I will be visiting Asheville with a group of 15 people total from May 20-23. We will be staying in an Airbnb in Fairview. Can anyone provide recommendations for shuttles large enough to accommodate this size group that can pick us up in Fairview for different activities? We would love to hike or do other outdoor activities, but are worried about relying on ubers to get us to the meeting points for different adventure companies. 

Similarly, does anyone have recommendations for 1) restaurants that can accommodate this size group or 2) restaurants/catering/individual chefs that would deliver to Fairview in large quantities? A lot of local bbq restaurants and those of the sort have catering, but pick up only, and we will be without a car. We would be willing to consider hiring a chef to come to the house and cook in the beautiful kitchen.

"Kinda hard to undo something y’all have been working to accomplish for the last 100 years.

You did not become a “tourist town” overnight.
You had to kill off other industries first.

Thousands of you built businesses selling the beauty and serenity of a Northern Carolina town. Well, you succeeded. Millions want to come here. This happens over and over and over from Austin to Ann Arbor. When places develop character, it drives popularity, and popularity drives price increases because of a little principle called Supply and Demand.

Question is: can you keep people in a Capitalist DEMOCRACY from spending their money where they choose?
I suspect not.

I was raised in a ski area, so Californians liking a rural place and moving there is nothing new.
Our bumper sticker said Don’t Californicate Colorado.

"Wikipedia says this:   
""Aerospace is a term used to collectively refer to the atmosphere and outer space. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and **military** applications. Aerospace engineering consists of aeronautics and astronautics.""

Okay, Montgomery civil rights movement began in 1955. Buncombe County's Reject Raytheon (P & W's parent company) has mounted almost two demonstrations or teach-ins a month for about a year and a half. We may ignite a national effort to control the obviously out-of-control military industrial complex. Buncombe could become the Montgomery of World Peace. May not. But since the destruction of humanity is at stake, it's certainly worth a try. In the nuclear age, the other country isn't the enemy, the enemy is war. This is so obvious given the threats Putin has made in the Ukraine war. And Buncombe County is now in the business of making parts for war. 

Mr. Whitesides should thus realize the potential for a local movement to become national such as the Civil Rights movement that he worked in. He stated to Reject Raytheon: "" I’ve been against every war since World War II, from Korea forward, including the Vietnam war that I was in, even though I was in the Navy. We have fought wars that didn’t even benefit this country. What did we get out of it but a lot of lost lives and in some cases the reputation of the country?""

"It is incorrect to say ""only"" but it does disproportionately affect black folx here in avl.

""One crime where arrest rates should be comparable among the whole population is marijuana possession. Annual surveys by the federal government show Black people report using marijuana at about the same rate as white people.

Yet African-Americans have accounted for 39 percent of Asheville Police charges for misdemeanor marijuana possession since 2012. In recent years, the percentage has climbed: 41 percent in 2018 and 46 percent in 2019. ""

M.B. Haynes - Employee owned (I think?).  Good benefits, good pay, practice proper safety, have a clear pathway for advancement.  Larger organization and may take a little more time from application to hiring.  My FIL works here in the plumbing division and likes it.

Emory Electric - On the larger side of a SMB, not sure about the rest

Grigg Electric - Smaller company, family owned and operated, solid benefits and pay.  Probably more room for advancement if you want to follow the apprenctice -> journeyman -> self-employed route.  I worked for them around 04-06 and enjoyed my time there (I haven't done trade work since) and I know several folks who have been there 25+ years.

"Cawthorn's  ""No"" vote on pot ranks low on my list of top 100 reasons I would not support him (somewhere behind his being a clueless, Trump-fluffing, crypto-fascist) but it's still worth mentioning.  

As for the strategy of voting for Wendy Nevarez, for me, she certainly is the ""best"" of the 8 Republican candidates.  So, if the goal is to feel good about one's vote being cast for the best of the GOP bunch, that makes sense.  If the top goal, however, is to defeat Cawthorn, I don't believe that voting for Nevarez makes strategic sense.  

First, we have to consider that she is underfunded, has no support within the GOP establishment, and has never run for or held office before.  That's a very deep hole to be in, and her strategy of primarily appealing to a small number of alienated, moderate Republicans, unaffiliated voters, and closet Democrats who register unaffiliated, just does not seem like a reasonable path to victory in a very red district.  I just don't see how she possibly gets more votes than Cawthorn or Edwards.  Maybe (a big maybe) she comes in third, but I'm betting 4th at best in a crowded field.  

Even more important to a possible Cawthorn victory though, is the fact that in order to win the nomination, and thus be re-elected in the general election in what is a safe Republican district, Cawthorn only needs to be the top vote getter in the 8 person field, and win 30+% of the vote.  With 7 other candidates splitting the anti-Cawthorn vote, it is very plausible that we could see him winning the nomination with less than 1/3 of the total GOP primary vote. 

So, if beating Cawthorn in the primary is the top objective, and everything else follows that goal in order of importance, then people may need to shift their traditional thinking from, ""which candidate do I like best (or, find least objectionable)?"" to ""which candidate has the best chance of beating Cawthorn?""  

As others have pointed out in this and other threads, the candidate with absolutely the best chance of beating Madcow is Chuck (hold your nose real tight before you vote for him) Edwards.  For me, voting for him will probably be the most unpleasant vote I've ever cast.  But I see Cawthorn and Trumpian politics at large as a direct threat to core (small d) democratic values.  Edwards is an asshole, and like most in the GOP he baits libs (i.e., Asheville), and likes to put a stick in their eye in policy terms, but I don't think he's a genuine fascist at heart the way Cawthorn is.",t2_1k4xlw4h,MelodicCheese,0,1648854896.0,0,t1_i31nfa6,i31nfa6,True,roonie1,t3_tu07ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/tu07ee/vote_out_wnc_rep_cawthorn_he_voted_against_the/,Vote out WNC Rep Cawthorn.

"A split GOP field *helps* Cawthorn, not hurts.

You're correct that the 70% number is not from an independent polling company, it's from Cathorn's internal data, which has him at 82% and Trump at 83% and I took out 10% because of that.

"Look at Russia. How many Russians do you think are privately thinking Putin is nuts? Apply the same logic to America. Lots of thoughts with little voice from the center, but ready to vote.

I really think the large majority of America is pretty moderate and center. You don't hear it because most of them aren't vocal, but the vote in 2020 showed that it certainly wasn't lopsided, just that only two parties hold the power in elections.

In WNC there's plenty of conservative Baptists that vote Democrat, many whom I call friends. They don't necessarily subscribe to all of the Democrat's far leftist rhetoric, just like many Republicans don't from the far right, and for that reason I refrain from lumping my exceptionally intelligent 85 year old Republican father and mother into the ""idiots"" category just because they voted Republican and I extend that same process to Democrats I personally know. A party shouldn't be what we define people by. That's what character is for.

We're never going to get everything we want. No one does. My hope is that we return to a more civil time when people thought before they spoke, and when they did speak, they carried weight like EF Hutton so telling people that the Orange Man has no clothes carried weight and opened their eyes so they could think for themselves.

I find it exceptionally ironic that Trump was a Democrat for so many years, and that so many of the far right follow him so blindly - a man that 20 years ago few Republicans would have followed, much less those on the far right. Blindness to see the nakedness. Maybe they missed that story in preschool.

">Can she bring in high value business like Knox White did with BMW and Michelin in Greenville?  That was a really transformative move for Greenville, it revitalized downtown Greenville and made it a destination for business.

(BMW is in Greer, though.)

Knox White has been mayor of Greenville since 1995 and on City Council since 1983. It took a while for the city to get to where it is now. Some city council members also have long tenures. That kind of stability makes it easier to attract talented city managers -- the current manager came in from Sandy Spring, GA in 2019 -- but it's still a long time to remain in office.

Greenville has a bunch of geographical advantages. A small-c conservative city government is more likely to get more favorable treatment from a conservative state government when it wants to raise and spend public money. Greenville also doesn't have the heavy influence of the Cecil family over land use. (The Pratt & Whitney facility shows how difficult it is to build large-scale high-wage manufacturing in the area, and it's in the county. There is literally not much space within the city limits for big industrial developments. New Belgium isn't to be sniffed at, but it only employs 135 people.)

I think the biggest general challenge for Asheville City Council is that it is collectively terrified of making decisions. It hides behind consultants. It kicks the can down the road. It is intimidated by those who wield power in the private sector, whether it's hoteliers or property developers or HCA/Mission or Ingles.

So I'm not trying to make excuses here: I think city leadership needs to be willing to make clear policy decisions and own them. But I also think it was way easier to encourage and manage growth when it was Julian Price and John Lantzius preserving buildings and charging affordable rents than having to deal with hotel after hotel after hotel.",t2_lnueq,etagloh1,0,1648837302.0,0,t1_i30izpa,i30izpa,False,northernboundary,t3_tt0jf0,https://www.reddit.com/r/asheville/comments/tt0jf0/kim_roney_for_asheville_mayor/,Kim Roney for Asheville Mayor,/r/asheville/comments/tt0jf0/kim_roney_for_asheville_mayor/i30izpa/,2,r/asheville,0,2

"Mostly because of either the local elites preventing construction of new housing, and rich people from elsewhere buying vacation homes here that they only use one week a year.

But yeah, even the county I live, in, McDowell, which is adjacent to Buncombe has a lack of affordable housing and is getting more expensive because more people are buying here because of our proximity to Asheville.

Other people have commented and are pretty right though, the main reason your seeing such expensive prices is because of the amount of land you want, you'd probably be able to find more reasonable prices if your willing to compromise on land, even if it's just accepting 2.5 acres over 5.

"Yes, you are correct and yes, I understand that.  And I totally see your point.  The mayor is mostly a figure head and sort of guides/helps the city council while the city manager is in charge of daily operations.  But the mayor can lead economic development efforts and important decisions that affect the community and the path of the city.  And I do believe that experience is needed to navigate that.  And perhaps we do need a stronger mayor ""system"".  With the right mayor of course.  As it seems all our city council and current mayor does is hire consultants as they don't have the experience needed to navigate things themselves.

Asheville has some pretty big issues.  Can Kim Roney make a decision to increase the operable hours of the city transit system?  Sure, most could.  That's a pretty minor issue in what Asheville is facing.

I think one of our biggest challenges are job availability and developing sectors other that tourism.  Does Kim Roney have the ability to layout an economic development plan to entice companies to bring businesses here?  Can she create realistic, actionable ideas to develop a thriving tech sector?  Or other sectors?  Does she understand business enough to create an environment in Asheville that has jobs with competitive salaries compared to other markets?  Currently job salaries in Asheville are way below other metropolitans.  And I'm not talking about minimum wage.  I'm talking about middle class  and lower middle class salaries.  Can she bring in high value business like Knox White did with BMW and Michelin in Greenville?  That was a really transformative move for Greenville, it revitalized downtown Greenville and made it a destination for business.   Now I know we don't want to be Greenville, but you understand what I'm saying.  Does she have the ability to understand the ramifications and future effects of a plan a developer is proposing?

I think Kim is just going to chase the newest social policy trend she read about somewhere like a squirrel going after a nut and doesn't think about the greater ramifications.  I mean if she did get elected and then established a permanent camping space, it would attract every transient in the South East.  Our homelessness and transient issue would explode.  Would that be good for business, jobs and our community?  We need someone with a real vision for Asheville that can help us get us through our current crossroad.
