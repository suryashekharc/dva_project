They do when you're taking a city which isn't improving its roadways, and actively making them worse by suggesting *removal* of lanes and parking.

>and tons of cities know this and function quite well with a vast network of them.

Tons of cities which don't have loads of snow. Tons of cities which don't have people who have to commute from 100km+ away because housing is unlivable with a federal government adding more and more people. Tons of cities where ""function quite well"" means getting stuck for hours going less than half the distance most people here do on their daily commute.

> People do need to get places, and we should be encouraging them to do it other ways than a car.

"Thank you! 

I’m unsure of the ‘reasoning’ 4 downvotes as well. 

My guess is either 

a) It’s a dumb post, worthy of ridicule that I don’t understand cuz I’m not open minded enuff

b) Ppl are vehemently taking sides/opinions on a cartoon/CGI movie that has the audacity to be set in Toronto, has lead characters that are female, has an Canadian/Asian context (despite that it’s clearly applicable to all persons), has the female lead lusting/crushing on a POC boy in the band, focuses on becoming more mature via independent thought & (gasp!) menstruation etc. 

There were a lot of energetic debates about the movie, which I fail to see. It was a fun movie. 

I guess empowered pubescent females is offensive to some. 

Menstruation? What’s debatable? 
Don’t all of us exist ONLY because of the egg etc cycle? The movie approached it in such a benign way. Couldn’t have done it better. 

Did u see the original “Carrie” movie, when she gets her first period, is ignorant about it due to her controlling (psycho) mom, and is pelted with tampons by her bullying peers? 

That’s ok for mainstream folks, but a movie with a lovable panda allegory isn’t?

"You may be a bit thrown off because this swan is a young swan, and still retains some of its juvenile colouration. When swans are young, they are much darker than when they're full grown and have more orange on their beak. However, they do not have the yellow beak markings of tundra swans nor the fully orange beaks of mute swans. I have watched their beaks go from almost fully pinkish orange a few months ago to almost entirely black nowadays. They are trumpeters, they just don't look exactly like the adults you're used to seeing :)

This is a short [Imgur album](https://imgur.com/a/sP6g9Hd) I put together after hanging out with the swans on Thursday. The last image is from months ago, it shows the two adult (fully white plumage, fully black beaks) swans with their younger offspring (grey+white plumage, partially orange-pink beaks).

"I'm in development. I'm a mid size contractor for high rise development.

No, contractors are already backed up with increasing prices.

Problem is mainly a very tough funnel to grow talented labour pool. Province makes it super hard to accredit foreigners, and there's already large red tape barriers to being an Ontario employer in construction so uptake of new small contractors is a fraction of what it once was -- meaning mid/large companies have to grow to increase supply and that's slower than fast moving entrepreneurs.

Think: policy, MOL, insurance, engineering, inspection submittals, JHAs, safety demands, employment law, bureaucracy, etc. Toronto used to be 1000s of skilled Europeans launching trade companies employing family/community members working as grandfather-apprentice-trades. That's all but gone on any mid size to large development project due to the hurdles.

Pretty much all grandfathering, apprenticing and challenging is gone now. It's all mandatory school for many years with wait lists to get in them. Makes funnel of new skilled people difficult, and makes top qualified people expensive creating downward pressure from employers with perverse incentive not to advance workers academically.

Non union sector it is very very hard to get through sponsorship to licensing without connections and unionization is still struggling (unions are way easier to get thru licensing).

Stack onto this having shit on technical trades as a profession for 30 years in schools and decreased unionization; you get a lot of poor performing people in relatively poor paying jobs (at least historically maybe not now) unless they have connections.",t2_dus08x9h,TOUnionPhilosopher,0,1648997930.0,0,t1_i389zq9,i389zq9,False,Bruno_Mart,t3_tuhx9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tuhx9t/ontarios_housing_plan_will_create_more_red_tape/,"Ontario’s housing plan will create ‘more red tape, not less,’ says Toronto’s chief planner",/r/toronto/comments/tuhx9t/ontarios_housing_plan_will_create_more_red_tape/i389zq9/,1,r/toronto,0,1

"As an engineering reviewer who reviews subdivisions/condos, you have no idea what kind of crap gets submitted by some consultants. A major thing people need to understand is that Consultants design condos/subdivisions for Developers, and neither of these parties have an incentive to spend money or time on doing things properly.

Designing a condo or subdivision requires 2 things: money and skill. I would add time, but time and money are the same thing to Consultants as they charge by the hour.

Consultants are under a lot of pressure to get projects approved in as little time as possible, while also ensuring the design is as cheap as possible because that means more profit for the Developer. It is almost like building a car that has to drive 100 miles, and then will hopefully break down immediately after because then you know you made efficient choices. They want the approval and that's it. There is also an element of general incompetency because a lot of Consultants also don't know what they're doing.

All of this means that there are often MAJOR engineering and planning issues that I encounter quite often. Missing studies for due diligence (because $$$), purposefully ignoring standards that care about the environment (because $$$), poor reasoning, legal issues that could completely fuck them in the future (but not now so who cares? /s) etc.  The reason why engineering approvals can take a long time is because government bodies are the only ones who don't have an incentive to save money.",t2_lhhgmtzc,SuperFatLynx,0,1648990274.0,0,t1_i37urbw,i37urbw,False,Bruno_Mart,t3_tuhx9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tuhx9t/ontarios_housing_plan_will_create_more_red_tape/,"Ontario’s housing plan will create ‘more red tape, not less,’ says Toronto’s chief planner",/r/toronto/comments/tuhx9t/ontarios_housing_plan_will_create_more_red_tape/i37urbw/,1,r/toronto,0,1

"> If you are not wearing reflective clothing while biking or have reflectors on your bike, you are at fault.

Nope. Bicycles (not riders) are expected to have some pretty simple lighting but that's it. [This bad boy](https://bikesharetoronto.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_6781-1536x1152.jpg) is compliant with all legal requirements for lighting and reflectors for a cyclist.

>  if you cross outside of intersections

That is perfectly legal in Ontario, check out section 144 of the Ontario Highway Act.

> (22) Where portions of a roadway are marked for pedestrian use, no pedestrian shall cross the roadway except within a portion so marked.  R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, s. 144 (22).
> ...
> (28) Every pedestrian who lawfully enters a roadway in order to cross may continue the crossing as quickly as reasonably possible despite a change in the indication he or she is facing and, for purposes of the crossing, has the right of way over vehicles. 

So a pedestrian can, within the Ontario Highway Act, absolutely perform a mid-block crossing with right-of-way where no marked crossing are available, and in doing so they have a right-of-way over vehicles.

Unfortunately the act is entirely non-specific about exactly how close one has to be to marking to be considered in violation of the requirement to use marked crossings when available.

The Toronto Municipal code says this:

> § 950-300 (B) No person shall, except where traffic control signals are in operation, or where traffic is
being controlled by a police officer, or at a pedestrian crossover, proceed so as not to
yield the right-of-way to vehicles and streetcars on the roadway; however, nothing in this
section shall relieve the driver of a vehicle or streetcar from the obligation of taking all
due care to avoid a collision

So pedestrians absolutely can enter roadways outside of controlled pedestrian crossings, they're just expected to yield to oncoming traffic... but that doesn't mean the traffic is necessarily at 0 fault if there's a collision because they're still expected to operate with ""due care"" according to the code.

> It is very rare for a driver to hit a pedestrian downtown and it be the drivers fault. 

This is inconsistent with the facts. A [2015 study from Toronto](https://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2015/pw/bgrd/backgroundfile-84111.pdf) found that pedestrians had clear right of way in 67% of the cases of a pedestrian injured or killed in a collision, and the right of way was unknown in another 19% of cases. A mere 14% of collisions with pedestrians happened with clear right-of-way for the vehicle.",t2_28cbus01,oefd,0,1648961974.0,0,t1_i36t7gs,i36t7gs,False,morenewsat11,t3_ttpf5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/ttpf5b/toronto_opens_third_collision_reporting_centre/,Toronto opens third collision reporting centre — for pedestrians and cyclists,/r/toronto/comments/ttpf5b/toronto_opens_third_collision_reporting_centre/i36t7gs/,1,r/toronto,0,1

"Snow storm worked out fine. I stayed home from work because roads were treacherous regardless of method of transportation. Tons of cars got stuck. Didn't see any news stories about bikes getting stuck.

I haven't done 100km in an hour on a bike. I don't need to. I don't need to drive that far in a car either 95% or the time. What an absurd metric.

I fit over 60lbs of gear on my bike (depending on what job I'm doing), and that has included circular saws and drills. They're not that big. Why are you transporting school lockers?

They do own one, or they wouldn't be biking with me.

"Does it surprise me? a bit, have I experienced this? yes. 

I used to work as a superintendent for a building that I would say the vast majority were seniors, quite a few of whom were bedridden or relied on PSWs. We had on average 5 to 10 PSWs in the building everyday and there was one woman in particular that stands out.

Her daughter lived in Europe and for whatever reason the daughter gave that lifealert/line service the superintendents number. So whenever the mother was having ""issues"" I'd get a call at all hours of the night. Majority of the time it was because she was lonely but often it was also due to her dementia. She was bedridden and couldn't move around her apartment. So i'd get calls that she was crying or ""in pain"" and I'd say probably once a week or so she'd manage to work the phone to call 911 so we'd have the fire department and paramedics out constantly. It was so bad that I was on a first name basis with the majority of fire fighters.

The mother desperately needed to be in a LTC facility but the daughter didn't want to pay for it. It got so bad that eventually the daughter requested that lifeline and myself stop calling 911 for her. I had enough and told the daughter that I wanted my number removed from the lifealert/line service.

Saving for a downpayment should be seen as something to work towards with a reward; as it is today people who save a downpayment are punished as housing inflates faster than saving is possible.

There are at least three components necessary to right the system:

A) We must stop giving away free money to anyone with a pulse

B) We must change regulations to favour the missing middle in housing

C) We must find ways to stimulate investment in housing: we need builders to build faster, in order to do that, it must be in their interests to build. People who have money should be encouraged to invest in housing, not just condos but the missing middle

It is NOT set up for clear results. It is set up to frustrate everyone involved, has no targets for outcomes, and very little standard processes.

Imagine wanting to build a shed in your backyard, you go to the city and they say that the overall policy of the city is to allow sheds in backyards, but there are no laws that allow them to give you a permit. You must hire an expert to create the laws that allow your shed consistent with the policy but it still takes two years. Then they agree to you concept in principle, but then spend another 12 months trying to figure out the language of the law even though they have agreed to allowing your shed. Concurrently, you apply for the shed permit and the city reviews it and 8 different City departments provide comments that say they want more trees, less trees, less shadow, a green roof, no storm water discharge, a water meter in the front, no water meters in the front, etc. It takes you 18 months to negotiate a resolution of all these matters between the various departments.

So, now you have a conditional permit to build your shed, 30 months after you started the process. You’re ready to go, but costs are higher because it’s 30 months later. You cancel the shed project and buy a car cover instead.

This is how we build housing in Toronto today.",t2_8x7faup5,Embarrassed_Ball_261,0,1648927574.0,0,t1_i353rnu,i353rnu,True,Bruno_Mart,t3_tuhx9t,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tuhx9t/ontarios_housing_plan_will_create_more_red_tape/,"Ontario’s housing plan will create ‘more red tape, not less,’ says Toronto’s chief planner",/r/toronto/comments/tuhx9t/ontarios_housing_plan_will_create_more_red_tape/i353rnu/,11,r/toronto,0,11

"A number of studies have looked into this more rigorously and suggest that in aggregate that’s unlikely to be the case. What you’re hearing from ‘local businesses’ (I’d be interested to see a source for that) may reflect sampling or confirmation bias, and doesn’t necessarily accurately reflect reality. 

Here’s [a summary of one recent large study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200422151318.htm) suggesting that bike lanes tend to be either economically neutral or net positive for local businesses.

[This article summarizes a few different studies](https://www.cambridgebikesafety.org/2021/09/22/bike-lanes-and-local-business-the-economic-impact/), including one that looked at the impact of bike lanes along Bloor that concluded “by economic metrics, after the bike lane was installed, businesses on Bloor St performed similarly or better than the control areas analyzed, even with the removal of parking on the pilot section of Bloor St.”

EDIT: Within that last article was a link to a [large systematic review](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2021.1912849) comprising 23 separate studies that looked into the issue. The main takeaway is as follows: “Taken together, the studies indicate that creating or improving active travel facilities [bike lanes] generally has positive or non-significant economic impacts on retail and food service businesses abutting or within a short distance of the facilities, though bicycle facilities might have negative economic effects on auto-centric businesses. The results are similar regardless of whether vehicular parking or travel lanes are removed or reduced to make room for the active travel facilities.”",t2_2dk4tpy3,frostedmooseantlers,0,1648927372.0,0,t1_i353dng,i353dng,False,EarthWarping,t3_tukxmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tukxmy/if_you_use_uber_eats_you_should_back_bike_lanes/,"If you use Uber Eats, you should back bike lanes on Yonge",/r/toronto/comments/tukxmy/if_you_use_uber_eats_you_should_back_bike_lanes/i353dng/,31,r/toronto,0,31

"It’s a conundrum. Despite all the comments, not everyone wants to own. It’s expensive and it’s a lot of work. And sometimes, like from 1989-1996, prices go down and it takes more than a decade to come back up. Worse, sometimes people have their houses taken away by the bank. In 1981, mortgage rates hit 18% (not a typo… eighteen!). I was in Calgary then. People were walking away from their homes. They couldn’t afford the payments and no one was buying. All their equity, gone. Like a market crash and you bought your stock in margin and there is a margin call. You’re screwed if you can’t cover.
There needs to be a supply of reasonably priced rentals as well. The ability to charge high rents, with people paying because they really have no choice, puts upward pressure on house and condo prices because the investor can get more revenue. Builders won’t build a surplus of houses that would drive their average price down. It is not in their interest. When the government builds low cost housing it typically turns into a place no one wants to live. Look at this graph for median house prices across the US. Look familiar?

"Agreed. These delivery apps take a significant cut that substantially eats into narrow profit margins small restaurants rely on to survive. And from what I’ve heard, it’s not as simple as you might think to just stop doing business with them. Best practice is to call the restaurant yourself to place your order and then go pick it up — this way all of the money goes to your local small businesses instead of a massive American tech company.

In the near future, I don’t think it’s inconceivable that companies like Uber might even launch their own delivery restaurants that compete with local businesses but also get preferential treatment on their app.",t2_2dk4tpy3,frostedmooseantlers,0,1648925985.0,0,t1_i350npp,i350npp,False,EarthWarping,t3_tukxmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tukxmy/if_you_use_uber_eats_you_should_back_bike_lanes/,"If you use Uber Eats, you should back bike lanes on Yonge",/r/toronto/comments/tukxmy/if_you_use_uber_eats_you_should_back_bike_lanes/i350npp/,14,r/toronto,0,14

">  Otherwise re-zoning will just provide more options to investors.

I see this view articulated a lot and I think it's deeply mistaken.

The financialization of housing is only viable *because supply is constrained*. Remember the toilet paper shortage from 2 years ago? You had people actually going into business buying up toilet paper and selling it at higher prices. But that wasn't a long term business strategy - nobody is making money at that today - because the supply chain quickly adapted and people were able to once again easily get toilet paper in stores.

Bitcoin is another good example. Keeping in mind that bitcoin is a Ponzi scheme that will eventually come crashing down, what makes bitcoin currently ""viable"" as an investment is that there are, and will always be, a limited number of bitcoins. People don't buy and sell US dollars with 50% profit because of the vast number of US dollars, and because the treasury would simply produce more of them if supply ran short.

I suppose we think of housing as an investment vehicle simply because we've been undersupplied for decades, so we don't know housing abundance. But supply really is the answer to speculation in the housing market.",t2_61skf,McKingford,0,1648924414.0,0,t1_i34xgh6,i34xgh6,False,Hrmbee,t3_tu42uc,https://www.reddit.com/r/toronto/comments/tu42uc/the_ford_government_isnt_taking_the_housing/,The Ford government isn’t taking the housing crisis seriously,/r/toronto/comments/tu42uc/the_ford_government_isnt_taking_the_housing/i34xgh6/,3,r/toronto,0,3

"We live in a beautiful Victorian semi in
Roncesvalles that we bought 10 years ago for 750k. It's now worth 2 million. We decided a few years back to turn the very unfinished (literally had a dirt floor) basement into a one bedroom apartment, which we now rent out to a tenant. We owed 500k on the house at the time, and took on 400k additional debt to have the apartment built. So, we now have 900k mortgage debt on a house that's worth 2 million. Of course we could sell the house tomorrow, wipe out the 900k debt and
pocket a million dollars. Problem is we don't ever want to sell, and would like to stay in the house, and hopefully pass it down to our kids someday. I still can't decide if we were smart or stupid to take on this amount of debt to own a home in downtown Toronto.

"I think the issue isn't necessarily the regulations but the enforcement. The province has all kinds of rules about how cities need to do planning and development such as: 

> ""maintain at all times where new development is to occur, land with servicing  
capacity sufficient to provide at least a **three-year supply of residential units**  
**available through lands suitably zoned to facilitate residential intensification**  
and redevelopment, and land in draft approved and registered plans.""

Given almost every single development application needs to apply for a rezoning in Toronto I'm pretty sure Toronto isn't having a 3-year supply of appropriately zoned lands, but there is literally no consequences for them just ignoring this. 

&#x200B;

That isn't to say the proposed bill will do much to change this, it honestly has none of the actually important parts of the recommendations (though they say they will be introducing more later). The current bill just says that if the city takes more than 30 days after a complete application has been submitted they have to start refunding the application fees - which is perfectly reasonable, as all the studies are done by the developer normally.

"Deffo, Toronto you can make more.  Hamburg and Copenhagen have very high median salaries... if you aren't in a finance/tech/medicine then your salary is likely higher in those two cities than it would be in TO.

'Keep' is a funny thing... and depends heavily on if kids are part of it and if/when you got into real estate. Childcare is nearly free in Sweden and can be almost 2k per kid in TO.    With lower housing and kid costs I had more left than a friend I knew in TO who'se wife and him both making twice what I did at the time.  Now the situation has swung back in their favour,  but hey.. not complaining.

I luckily switched into Tech a while ago and work for an American company and run my own consultancy of the side.  So income is not an issue, and the brutal marginal tax here at my income can partially be avoided through paying myself less, corporate expensing, and dividends...  but you are right.. if you are just taking a ppaycheque there is definitely a limit in Sweden.   The best possible situation here is live in Swe, work in Copenhagen and it's a pretty good deal, but you don't live here in order to max your income. If it wasn't for the kids and the awesome infrastructure for them here, I'd move to Portugal or Costa Rica and just work my American job haha.

"Thank you for sharing.

In my opinion...I feel like southern Sweden has a ceiling on growth.

I mean you could be happy at that level till your retire.

But north America doesn't have a ceiling. Sky's the limit. Depending on job..role of course. I mean in general.

You mentioned housing and cycling.. yes great. Parts of quality of life. If you're content.. you should never leave. I truly mean that.

I'm not saying toronto is great..I'm not even there now myself...I'm just saying...earning potential is very high. But the places have their own issues. Crime..travel..housing.

So it's all about what makes you happy.

Again thanks for sharing because I really wanted to know which cities you meant!

I'm not an expert but I'd think Hamburg out of the cities you mentioned had the highest earning potential ..but that's in general. I don't know what you do. Then of course that city would bring with it other issues.

It's not how much you make..its how much you keep..and how far it goes in that place.

"I currently live in Southern Sweden.   Highly pleasant medieval town,  Malmo and Copenhagen are just a short transit away for serious culture and entertainment.  Cost of living is low,  taxes are brutal, but my income is high.  No stress living well and saving lots.

I have lived in Ecuador, South coast UK,  another city in Sweden, Calgary,  Hamburg, and Utrecht.   Don't get me wrong, Toronto is a great city.  But if existence is a grind to break even then a lot of it is wasted. If you're on the lucky side of the housing market and can get good work without much of a commute, then hard to point at many places better.

You'd have to define 'better'..  Ecuador is amazing but you can't build a life there..  The lifestyle cost / income is definitely easier in Calgary (if you can get good work) south Sweden, Hamburg, and Utrecht.  Southern Sweden for sure better if you have kids.  

The amount of culture you can access is as good as Toronto in almosrt any metro area in much of Europe.   Being able to work remote vastly increases the number of viable places.  Optimum I think is to live in a nicer smaller place a short train hop from a major center.

I don't miss traffic.  I like being able to walk or cycle everywhere and can be in downtown Copenhagen in an hour door to door for a 25 buck return fare.
