"Make sure the tires are good and it'll probably be fine for you. The roads are kept pretty clear during winter. The only concern I would have is the battery.


From a random 2017 article on cars.com: ""Still, it should be noted that if you’re the type to go out when it’s really cold, the Prius owner’s manual states, “When the hybrid battery (traction battery) is extremely cold (below approximately minus 22 degrees Farenheit [minus 30 degrees Celsius]) under the influence of the outside temperature, it may not be possible to start the hybrid system. In this case, try to start the hybrid system again after the temperature of the hybrid battery increases due to the outside temperature increase, etc.”""


Note that -22 degrees Fahrenheit isn't uncommon here during the winter. The temps can drop that low every night for sometimes weeks at a time. I have a friend who drove a Prius for a while (she parked it outside) and I think she couldn't start it a handful of times over the 2 year period she had it.

"MINOT, N.D. — Last night the Grand Forks City Council gave approval to a controversial corn milling plant to be built by a Chinese-owned company named Fufeng.

The project is controversial for a lot of reasons, from not-in-my-backyard concerns about smell and traffic and zoning to growing domestic concerns about China's presence in our economy.

That's a healthy debate to have, but things got a little bizarre at the meeting last night when a right-wing activist and frequent fringe candidate for public office, Michael Coachman, attempted a citizens arrest over the project.

""This is what is talked about as a citizen's arrest by a private person,"" Coachman told the council after a testy back-and-forth with Mayor Brandon Bochenski over his address (Coachman lives in Larimore, not Grand Forks). He said he could make the arrest on the authority of state law and ""god the father and the holy spirit.""

The alleged charges? According to Coachman, the council as well as Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer, Congressman Kelly Armstrong, Gov. Doug Burgum, and a laundry list of other public officials violated federal law prohibiting support of a foreign government as well as state laws related to the refusal to perform duties and criminal conspiracy.",t2_nch6u7z,smooth_bastid,0,1645659223.0,0,t1_hy61xms,hy61xms,False,lonelyone12345,t3_szk12c,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandForks/comments/szk12c/port_this_guy_tried_to_arrest_the_grand_forks/,Port: This guy tried to arrest the Grand Forks City Council last night,/r/GrandForks/comments/szk12c/port_this_guy_tried_to_arrest_the_grand_forks/hy61xms/,3,r/GrandForks,0,3

"I've got a smaller 15 gallon.  Make sure to prime the water using something that can take care of chloramine (e.g., prime).  Otherwise, I've found getting fish/plants from Pets R Inn (in the mall) survive much better than PetCo/PetSMart.  The latter two use RO water and the water parameters are extremely different from that you can get from the tap in town.  I've found Pets R Inn's water to be nearly identical, so if a fish/plant is doing well there, it'll probably do well in your town.

As for things you can't get at Pets R Inn, you can try drip acclimating, but that can be a struggle.

All else fails, you can buy an RO system...

"GRAND FORKS — The Grand Forks Police Department says a series of break-in cases have baffled them for more than two years, and what was the intent of these random break-ins.

Investigators aren't sure if it's the same guy each time, but admit the cases are similar and the victim's description of the suspect are pretty close.

""I have to live with that fear everyday, and so do all the victims,"" said Jacquelyn Emery.

Surveillance video at her home provided police with one of the best leads in the case when a man broke into her off campus home back in May. She believes the same man also broke into her house in October and sexually assaulted her roommate.
 
Emery, a senior aviation student at the University of North Dakota, says it's tough to close her eyes at night.

""Is tonight the night he breaks-in again,"" Emery says she asks herself each night.

The suspicious incidents started in November 2019, when a man was caught taking pictures inside a sorority house at UND in the middle of the night.

The following August, a similar looking man struck again, breaking into a home near campus full of sleeping women. A man broke in again the next night, but nobody was home.

A man came back a third time, but was spooked off by someone in the yard.

""It's tough on you, you don't like to not be able to figure things out,"" said Lieutenant Jeremy Moe with the Grand Forks Police Department.

Grand Forks police did identify and speak with a person of interest who is a student on campus. However, despite multiple investigators working the cases over the past two years, they can't pin down who may be behind the break-ins, or say with certainty that they are all connected.

After using all investigative tactics, the cases are now closed. But they can be reopened at any moment.

""Any new information that is developed or passed along to us, we will follow up on,"" explained Moe.

While the cases may be closed, Emery wants to share the nights of terror at her house to remind other young women on campus this guy is still out there.

""I don't think he is going to stop, so that's why I am here today, just to warn other people. I don't think this person's done,"" she said.",t2_4dcpa9qa,Lurker-O-Reddit,0,1643551582.0,0,t1_huupwa3,huupwa3,True,Air9821,t3_sfv2ue,https://www.reddit.com/r/GrandForks/comments/sfv2ue/i_dont_think_hes_going_to_stop_victim_of/,'I don't think he's going to stop': victim of suspected serial predator at UND speaks out,/r/GrandForks/comments/sfv2ue/i_dont_think_hes_going_to_stop_victim_of/huupwa3/,3,r/GrandForks,0,3

I mean grand forks is great. Just getting populated more and more every year. If we get a decent amount of snow they will probably put up the flood walls come spring then there's not anything to do but take toys out of storage🤣 
The homelessness is nuts there, my gf and I love going to old sac but the cons outweigh the pros, especially when it comes to smell. 
I've been trying to take up hobbies to meet new people around here but they all tend to be into snowmobiles, farming, school or trucks. It's a little bit of a pain in the ass finding groups when it comes to meeting people picking up hobbies and after 9 years or so, its starting to get annoying as I don't have many friends or anything relatively close to that which blows chunks.

"I'm a transplant who has lived here 11 years, and the winters haven't driven me away (yet). My take on Grand Forks is that it is *fine*. It is not my dream location and I probably won't retire here (moved for work), but I'm fairly content.

I've been fairly fortunate that I've found a good group of friends here. There are many tales of people being closed off to newcomers (to be fair, I've heard this about the Twin Cities too). But the geeky circles (book club, board game group) I am a part of are pretty welcoming. 

You asked specifically about nightlife, and from what I know is a lot of the downtown bars cater to the college crowd. There are some bars outside of downtown that pull in a more mature group, but a lot of them have more of a blue collar vibe. St. Paul may be tough to get an Uber willing to take you, it would be a pretty long drive. Amtrak goes there though. Winnipeg (about 2.5 hour drive) would probably have some decent nightlife once the border is fully open.

* I love snow

* Before last year, it hadn't snowed in NYC **for three years ....**

* Seventy-five fuckin' degrees on Christmas Eve ....  Enough already.

* I want to experience a place where *gasp!!* Winters are actually cold.

**SHOPPING:**

* Never been to a Walmart: they don't exist here.  lol

* A place that covers my supermarket *and* other stuff needs all in one spot ...??  Sign me up!

* I like that stuff closes on Sundays.  When I was a kid, it used to be that way, 

and for one day at least in the week, there'd be peace & quiet in the streets ....  

Know everything's closed on Sundays and don't stock-up on Saturday?  Tough toenails.

"I'm guessing you got the church thing from the older crowd? As a Grand Forks lifer I long ago decided the fish sandwich they served on Fridays was gross and sky wizards were unneeded. 

I'm late 30's and I've never actually had a discussion about church with anyone new in the region before. I'm also child free so that may be a difference as well?

Racism is very well alive with the older generations. My parents are bad at it. Younger crowd if they're the small town type will have it taught to them as well. It's getting better but still not great. There are a chunk of people that move out here to avoid the diversity of other locations. So they'll try and keep the small kindness going.

The winter is a winter that's for sure. But I is what you make of it. Late 30's and I make a bad ass snow fort with friends in my yard or we go sledding. Last year's snow was underwhelming so that didn't happen. But ice skating and pick up hockey out at the rinks is still fun. Cross country skiing and snowshoeing is great as well. The Greenway gives you plenty of space to try outdoor things. It just seems people get stuck on the wind or temperature. 

One of these years we'll get mini golf and an adult arcade. We have axe throwing now. So it's a start.

Steers is still open. We have good Mexican at a few places now. Indian place opened up. Plenty of sushi places. A pho place. Thai food. Etc.

You can get a nice home for $130/sq foot. It’s a quiet town compared to NYC, but has lots to do if you’re interested and willing to seek it out. VERY FRIENDLY PEOPLE. 
 
It’s a white collar (svcs for farmers and Air Force) university town that offers plenty of things to do. Its not stuffed down your throat though, you have to find it on your own. 

Golf, hockey, curling, hunting/fishing, biking, walking trails. We were members at the country club and it was a great way to meet people and get plugged in.

"I really like it. I grew up here and returned to raise a family here. It’s safe, calm (especially summer weekends when the population empties to go to their lake cabins in Minnesota), and the people are extremely friendly and warm. 

Yes, it’s very cold in the winter. Sometimes brutal cold. By February people are starting to go nuts and need  break from three months of frigid temps. But those cold temps keep out the riff raff, and keep the place safe. My orients retired in FL and said the winters here are like the summers in FL: you run to your pre-chilled or pre-warmed vehicles and then quickly make you way indoors. 

There are chain restaurants, yes. But there’s plenty of ma and pa places. You just have to be open to finding them. 

Taxes are a bit high, but that’s because we have incredible parks, roads, and other stuff. Friends who have moved here from major cities laugh at how affordable it is, while North Dakotans complain about how expensive it is.

"Moved there in 2016, left in 2019.

For weather, the wind is constant. Pretty much no matter where you face you're going to get hit by wind. Nice in the summer. Shitty in the winter. Snow is annoying as it is everywhere. Get a good blower and you should be fine.

Commercially you have things you need like Walmart and Target. Smaller stores too. I think they're called blue laws? But basically when I was there stores weren't allowed to open before noon on Sunday for religious reasons. Annoying as hell. No pun intended but I'm keeping it in.

That leads me to the people. My wife and I had an incredibly difficult time meeting people and developing a friend group. In conversation things were looking good, but once we mentioned we don't go to church a wall was instantly up. Like, immediately. Enough so that we started saying we're ""between churches"". Neighbors wouldn't give us the time of day until we said that.

Diversity is also a big deal. My wife is Middle Eastern but white-passing. Conversations with her colleagues quickly led to ""you're one of the good ones"". Lots of passive racism. Usually you'll see it applied to the Somali population.

Food is a biggie too. Like American food? Good. That's all you'll get that's good. Except for the Somali joint, but I think they shut down... My nachos were made with American cheese at a local place for an example...

Outdoors in the summer is great though. Parks and Rec does a good job of hosting community events, bike paths are great, and Lincoln Park is pretty nice for frisbee golf/walkabouts/playground/dog run, etc.

"Lots of new and new-ish properties on the south side of town...south of 32nd Ave, west of Washington.  Attached/underground garage makes the winters infinitely more bearable, if you can swing it.  College town so you will likely find a mix of college students, young families, and seniors in most places.  Trail system is fairly extensive, and there is a large community rec center (Choice Health & Fitness) with several nearby housing options.  32nd is pretty much the main (only) retail corridor.

Commutes are easy and traffic is almost non-existent, so you won't have a problem regardless of where you work.

Duplexes are often called ""twin homes"" here, but many are fairly large and (IMHO) overpriced.  The vast majority seem to be for sale and not for rent.

Lots of college-type bars for nightlife, unless you just want to get drunk at home in which case there are plenty of liquor stores because ND has plenty of those. Turtle River State Park isn't isn't far and is nice for hikes during the non snowy as shit months. But we do have a lot of flat land for cross-country skiing and places from which to rent equipment. This may sound kind of lame, but I personally appreciate our library, although I'll be honest and say it doesn't necessarily offer more than other libraries, it's just nice nice be somewhere quiet where you aren't expected to buy something.

The town kind of goes nuts for college hockey in the winter, so that's a pretty big social event. Winter dominates here, so you have to plan around that a lot (though I'm sure you're used to some semblance of that in Chicago, just more to do there).

"Widman's is currently ""the"" candy store in town. They've made their fame on chippers (chocolate covered potato chips). They make some other candies, but they also sell bulk candy like you get at the grocery store. Like someone else mentioned we had a 50s style eatery (Toppers) that did milk shakes, burgers, and the like and it seemed to be doing well until it burned to the ground (like the owner's former business [42nd st eatery IIRC]).  

One of the issues I'd foresee you having is staffing, as there are many businesses hurting to maintain staff.

"I would support that. I know a lot of people are bringing up Widman's, but I think it's a little unfair to suggest your candy couldn't compete with theirs, especially if you were to offer food and beverages as well. The one thing nobody else has mentioned is that we already had a couple candy places try opening up in the past few years, and end up shutting down. Candy Corner lasted a few years, and Sweet Dreams only lasted one or two. I'm not trying to discourage you, just giving you something to think about.

That being said, I've always wanted a local place for ice cream and milkshakes, and if you were able to offer that alongside candy, especially on the south end of town, I'm sure I'd be a regular. Hypothetically, there's no reason this town can't support two candy stores, you just need to be smart about how you differentiate yourself from the competition.

In regards to a business name, I'll echo the sentiment that it shouldn't be too fancy.

As for DogMahal, I am speaking of only more music nights of one or even two genres. Yes, one of the only all ages venues in town. It can prove to be trying to do that due to sheer amount of punk/alternative/post-punk, etc (select whatever genre or genres).

"Bemidji Birder here. I grew up on the UND campus. I watched them build 'The Eternal Flame', install the armilary on central campus, went to school at Lake Agassiz Elementary and even used to live where the Math Building sits now. I make regular runs to ND birding and am very familiar with the area. 

If you have never been to Kelly's Slough this is a must. Bring binoculars and a camera with a good telephoto. The easiest way to get there is to head West on Hwy 2 past the Civilian Airport to 20th St NW. Watch for the Magoo's Tattoo sign. They are World renowned for their Tats. Take a Right and follow it North for 3.5mi and you will come to a low area with water on both sides. The gravel roads are soft so drive slow and watch for birds. Stay in your car and use it as a blind. Birds see cars as harmless lumbering beast, they recognize you as danger and will flee. Check the shoreline on the island to the West for Avocets as well as the mudflats on the North shore. They will be nesting soon. 

When you have finished there, head north 1.5mi to Co.11 blacktop. Take a left (west) and go 1/4 mile down the hill to the ponds. Stop and get an eyeful. This is where I took this picture. Head West for 3/4mi to the big tower and turn left (South) back into the Reserve. Travel every road between there and the Air Force Base and make sure you check out the AF Base settling ponds.

In the open areas watch for Snipe on fence posts, Kingbirds (eastern and western) on power-lines and shrubs, Meadowlarks everywhere, Harriers flying low over fields, Clay Colored Sparrows in the shrubs and Marsh Wrens in the reeds. Keep a close eye on the ditches for waterfowl.

On the ponds the variety is endless and constantly changing. I have seen birds in these ponds I have never seen anywhere else. Red-necked Phalarop, Marbled Godwit, Cinnamon Teal and more. Currently there are lots of Pin-tails, Green and Blue Winged Teal, flocks of Marbled Godwits, a few American Avocets, many Yellow legs and others. The show changes almost weekly.

"Obviously we are a bit far from an ocean, so it's not going to be 100% up to snuff for Japanese cuisine that can get same-day food deliveries. 

I know that they get the freshest fish available though. It gets flown in overnight direct from the West coast to supply many restaurants in town, so it's as fresh as you can get without having direct access to the ocean. Almost anything else seems to be sourced locally too from what I've heard. 

I'd say it should be pretty close to what your husband would expect, and definitely the most authentic Japanese food you can get in the area. Staff are great, chefs are very skilled. Pre-covid you would likely have a hard time getting a seat!

Sushi- Shing Ya. They also have awesome fried rice and Ramen.
 
 
Pizza - Late night pizza I pay the extra for Boss pizza half the time now because of the chicken and other options. Deeks has such limited toppings as well.
  
  
Wings - Parrots Cay.
 
 
Blue Moose, Elys Ivy, and Toasted Frog are all nice restaurants with good rotating menu's. 
Ely's makes an effort to use locally grown products as much as possible.
Blue moose has a great beer selection at an inflated price. I used to go there after 9pm to get the late night discount so they were actually a normal price.

Not a bad place, nice, quiet, Walmart, Sam’s, liquor stores, hair cutting places, restaurants (unless you wanna cross the bridge to Minnesota and eat at the blue moose, sickies, or the Thai place or the burger place but it’s still just 5 minutes away) ice cream places, antique shops, gas stations, you are pretty centrally located living here.
