"Ooh ooh I know about this one. California civil code: 

> 

>Statute: Cal. Civ. Code § 1748.1(a) (West)

>Statute: (Cal. Civ. Code § 1747.02(a) (West) (defining “credit card”))

> “No retailer… may impose a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check or similar means…”
Statute: Cal. Civ. Code § 1748.1(a) (West)""




> “A retailer may, however, offer discounts for the purpose of inducing payment by cash, check or other means not involving the use of a credit card, provided that the discount is offered to all prospective buyers.”

&nbsp;


This varies state by state. Credit cards cost money for a retailer to process. Large money in fact. No it is not 49 cents per transaction, it's anywhere from 2-5% of the total depending on which credit card (Amex and Discover are higher). You disagree? You're wrong. 

&nbsp;

So it is illegal for a retailer in California to charge a surcharge for credit cards. It is, however, perfectly legal for them to give an additional discount if you pay by cash (or check). And this is because there's generally no fees associated with cash/check that the retailer would have to pay. This is why, at every gas station, you see a cash price, and a credit price. 

&nbsp;

But if the retailer simply puts ""all pricing is including cash discount"" on whatever they list prices on, and they honor those cash prices across the board, it's fully legal to ""charge extra"". It's bullshit red tape / semantics. But that's government. 

&nbsp;

"The 1% rate is dated. The current credit cards rates have sky rocketed to all types of businesses. You used to be able to negotiate your rate or shop it around. However, since the delivery apps like Grubhub & DoorDash, you have no power to negotiate, drastically changing the industry. It’s terrible. While I don’t agree with adding an additional fee.

"As a former pub crawler, agreeing with the above.  Oceanside is not the place to party.  (And that makes me sad.)

If you are downtownish, though, there's a nice pub walk from about Bagby to LTH, to Stone, and little places in-between to figure out on your own what your vibe is.

Downtown Vista Village has some life to it too along Main St., 
Carlsbad Village is pretty good, but far and the train doesn't run during the fun hours.

"Hey man good luck, sorry I couldn't figure out a way to work with you.  Sounds like you are going for a more live/punk rock feel while I'm totally opposite using pretty much only pre-recorded loops and doing nothing live.

When I asked about your music theory knowledge - it isn't absolutely necessary - especially if you are going for a more Punk type feel.  It's just that it is more necessary to *my personal workflow* so I didn't think we'd be a good fit working together without it since I do nothing live.

Either way, feel free to hit me up for any questions.  I can definitely help you out with advice on recording gear and help you get your recording methods figured out.  I also know a fair amount about live gear too since I DJ'd for many years.  I'm fairly knowledgeable about the low end gear (especially the brands to avoid) and best 'bang for your buck' low to midrange gear.

"I used to live in the apartments on the corner of Melrose and Oceanside Blvd, right behind the transit station/gas station, and before that I lived by Vista High so I have many years of experience in that part of town. There is nothing to walk to in that neighborhood. Or at least no roads you'd want to walk since they are all very busy and people drive fast, so it's not an enjoyable walk.  

I enjoyed living so close to the train station as I could easily take the train to Oceanside instead of driving. There were a lot of homeless people at the transit station and down by the sports park before they started construction on the houses. Not sure what that is like now. The freight train does go by a few times a week very late at night, and is loud. 

Traffic is a bitch right there because both roads are major arteries for Vista and Oceanside. Melrose in particular gets very backed up during morning and evening rush hour. 

Honestly you spend a lot of time and gas driving to other places for activities. Downtown Vista does have a few things to do like breweries and restaurants, but it doesn't exactly have a ""nightlife"" like someone else said. Vista is a very family oriented town with not a whole lot to do and traffic engineers who are hell bent on making it the least drivable city in San Diego. I'd consider where you commute to every day as well as it can easily take 40 minutes to get from one end of Vista to the other. There are a few good parks in town to take kids to so that's a plus. 

As for crime, that area doesn't have any more crime than San Marcos. Vista is a fairly safe city. But saying that there are still a few neighborhoods I'd stay out of, which are on the same side of town but down a ways. 

Overall that area is fine. It's not exciting at all it's just a normal and boring part of town.",t2_5maax,atonickat,0,1647892156.0,0,t1_i1kkai4,i1kkai4,True,[deleted],t3_tjhkg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oceanside/comments/tjhkg0/melrose_droceanside_blvd/,Melrose Dr/Oceanside Blvd?,/r/Oceanside/comments/tjhkg0/melrose_droceanside_blvd/i1kkai4/,2,r/Oceanside,0,2

"

Oceanside is not very walkable as a general rule.  Every block is huge and full of hills. 

It used to be nothing but dirt dividing Oceanside and Vista, so would not expect much crime at this time.

Would be closeish to downtown Vista Village.  Lots of things to do there if you need some sort of nightlife.  (Used to be very high crime, but  now much safer with new developments).  

Guajome is a nice large park and mostly undeveloped land for hike-walking and biking.  Children's areas near the duck pond.  (Beware of rude geese)

"No need to apologize-  it’s totally a group of subhumans that feel entitled no matter where they venture on this planet- they think it’s theirs to destroy as they please. 

There just so happens to be a concentrated bunch here from Arizona at the current moment wreaking havoc but like I said, definitely not all of them! Definitely not you. Plenty of locals trash the place too, sadly. 

Prior to my husband now being more involved with things that get trashed, I would have assumed there’s some costly damage here and there. But now that he vents about his day I’m seeing there’s a HUGE cost to local taxpayers and I’m shocked at the amount of destruction humans think is ok to cause, day after day. Literally just the cost of the destroyed bathroom lights, or drain covers, or what people purposely do to the toilets is both shocking, revolting, and makes me realize there’s an entire underbelly of society most of us don’t realize exist.

"Coffee is easy, it's espresso that is complicated, expensive, and takes quite a bit of training to do it right.

This is about as close as you can get at home inexpensively, requires minimum $100 investment: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgIVfU0xBjA

If you watch it it's still quite a bit of work for a single espresso beverage.

"It definitely bums me out to read comments like this!

They are locally run and operated and do SO much good for each community they’re in — it’s a huge reason why they have such a huge following! No doubt they’ll be looking into ways to literally bless the community of Oceanside/Vista and beyond!

Reading your comment, you may be interested to know more about DB so I am happy to expand on this!

There are three annual company-wide giveback days:

-	Dutch Luv Day
(February 14th — $1 of every drink sold supports LOCAL nonprofit organizations — generally to an organization fighting hunger)

-	Drink One for Dane
(A Friday in May — a huge chunk of net sales is given to support the MDA (Muscular Dystrophy Association))

-	Buck for Kids
(A day in September — $1 from every drink sold goes (again) to support another LOCAL nonprofit organization — specifically one that helps the youth!)

^^ these are just the yearly super-fun giveback days each location participates in each year.

IN ADDITION to these company wide giveback days, the local operator may host planned giveback days at their shops where a specified amount of sales are donated to a local organization or cause — all this $$ goes back to benefit the community and it’s a huge part of the company mission.

Each operator gets to live in the community they work in and strives to provide a fun, stable and healthy work environment for members of the community and a great experience therein for folks like you to roll through, say wassup and grab a cup of coffee/tea/Rebel/smoothie/etc.

Here’s a link to more information if you’re interested! :)

"Your circle is a bit off and makes a world of difference.  That house on Magens Bay is right around the corner from me.  I moved here a couple months ago and this area feels just fine.  The only complaint is that it's at least a 15 minute drive to get anywhere.  There's also a fair amount of noise from Camp Pendleton.

"I used John's Natural Dog training about 12 years ago for my 2 puppys and it was great.  He spent most of the time training me how to train my dog which was exactly what I needed.

When I got my 3rd dog recently from a puppy I used what I learned and my lil Bobbi is an extremely polite and well behaved dog.

"Pamela Chandler does pack walks at Buddy Todd Park on Wednesdays at 8am. They meet in the open field by the parking lot. It's $20 a class. There are anywhere between around eight and eighteen dogs in attendance. The group starts with about twenty minutes of training exercises before the walk. It's a great opportunity to be surrounded by other dogs in a training environment. It has helped my two dogs walk on leash without reactivity to other dogs. She also offers group training classes and private training. I recommend participating in a pack walk and then deciding if she's a good fit for you and your dog. Once you have attended a pack walk, she is available to call for advice with your pup. If you can't make it on Wednesday, there are also walks in Encinitas on Sunday mornings. I've attended these walks for years and have witnessed many doggie success stories. You do need to sign up for the walks in advance, here is her website [https://dogsense.community/](https://dogsense.community/)",t2_iie896rg,grillmeeeeacheeze,0,1644276206.0,0,t1_hw0dk57,hw0dk57,True,redblendkp,t3_smrcz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oceanside/comments/smrcz4/recs_for_dog_training_classes/,Rec’s for dog training classes,/r/Oceanside/comments/smrcz4/recs_for_dog_training_classes/hw0dk57/,3,r/Oceanside,0,3

"I agree, I was a 2013 graduate from OHS and I knew a good amount of people who went to the CSUs and UCs. I don't know if they still have it but the Health Career Academy and avid programs were amazing. I can speak from experience that if your child is in the Health Career Academy, they will do their best to prepare your child for the Healthcare field. The teachers helped in making sure we all were building a good resume by the time we graduated and that we all had a clear Career pathway. The classes the students take in the program are transferable to the local community colleges. And they make sure that they at least are registered ahead of time before the graduate at least to the community college. I don't know if they still do it but I remember there was an option to take the ASVAB if you wanted to join the military.

"I have 2 suggestions. 
1st for proximity is Surfside Educational Academy on Ditmar st between Oceanside Blvd and Eucalyptus st, entry on Eucalyptus. It's a school so people use it as a dog park after hours. 4 - 6 pm it's really popping off with pups in a big open grassy field. Most of the dogs are friendly enough with a few exceptions, (don't blame the dog) you'll see what I mean. No water bowl, but the poop bags are often stocked. 

2nd is a short departure from Oceanside maybe 5 - 10 min drive near El Camino Real and Carlsbad Village dr. Ann D. L'Heureux Memorial Dog Park is an excellent dog! All dogs and people are well behaved. Mulch is refreshed regularly. Fresh water and poop bags are always available, plenty of parking.

"As everyone else has already stated, it's Camp Pendleton you're hearing. I'm an O'side native and have been listening to it all my life.

Although every now and then you'll get a good boom that'll make the windows rattle.

While nighttime drills are by no means unheard of, they definitely are *not* a regular occurrence. Maybe 3 or 4 times a year. I don't think I've ever heard them go past 9 or 10 PM.

"It was the WAY Revolution Roasters came in that rubbed locals the wrong way. Captain’s Grounds was literally just a cart back in those days, and when RR’s owner was asked how they could justify opening up directly next to a very small but deeply local business, their response was somewhere along the lines of “Captain’s can just move.”

The family that owns and operates Captains has deep and longstanding roots in our community so that attitude did not go over well.

"Great article and thanks for writing it.   I think it bears mentioning though that RR had an atrocious, entitled attitude moving in close to CG. At the time, the Grounds was a coffee cart and during the city inspection period, one of the owners of RR was asked  by the city official why she was moving in next to the Grounds. The response ‘they’re just a cart- they can move’.  

That really fired up the local supporters of the Stoddards (Ted and Jen) who then went on to establish today’s permanent coffee counter. 

So the premise of the article is still solid but the catalyst for the animosity was missing.  

Personally, I’ll never step foot in RR and can only hope that the new roasters on Morse and Hill St have better luck playing nicely with established folks (note: I’m having brain freeze on the shop name and don’t know the owners).

"interesting.  As a ""gentrifier"" who just moved here in November, I wouldn't have guessed Captains would have such a following.  It just looked like a coffee stand tacked on to a clothing store.  Did they open at the same time, or did the coffee counter come after the vintage clothing store?

In my search for a frozen/blended coffee drink (i.e. sbux frappucino, coffee milkshake, etc), I was looking at places on Yelp.  Revolution didn't seem to have one, but Captains did.  I almost missed it since the Captains Helm signage was so much more prominent.  I also wouldn't have expected it to be basically next door to Revolution, so we nearly drove past it.  I knew it would be after Revolution when coming up the coast highway but didn't pay that close attention to their proximity. In any case, the drink was good, and I plan to go back for another next time I'm over that way.

"I love the start of this. I think the issue with General bus usage, or public transit usage, is consistency, as you have stated.   
I think the issue with buses is that there is a lack of dedicated infrastructure to these kinds of thing (buses, bicycles in particular).   
Proven examples of working systems exist, and utilising examples from areas that have seen increased ridership and quality of life would certainly help with your proposal. There is a great channel on youtube called: ""Not Just Bikes"" that i highly recommend for getting some ideas on how good infrastructure looks, and performs.

"I’m down to be friends! We all have those moments in life 
Where it’s never going to be easy nor  fun but your girlfriend will get through it! Oceanside doesn’t have anything for teaching online? because I know back at home it did. Even if that meant only dealing with one student who was being homeschooled. Back at home when I was working I was an afterschool program teacher and my coworker told me that there is that option. I was just trying to see what she can do if possible. But other than that, that’s pretty cool that you guys smoke together Unfortunately I don’t. Since I grew up with my criminal justice family and military family and they were really strict and I never really cared to do that stuff and now I’m going to the Criminal Justice field and now I really can’t do it 😅

My major option is pretty interesting!

"His take is dated.  It's mostly based on past reputation. 

It was true mid 2000's and every year before, with 2 different serious budget reforms by the district in 2006 & 2009, they turned things into a very positive direction.

The 2 high schools get better every year in terms of campuses, teachers, and student opportunities. 

The middle schools do kinda have a tier system in terms of which one's best vs worse offering.  Certainly, the weak point of the district. 

Most of the elementary schools have become very good, again lead by the quality of teachers. 

Obviously, the higher cost of living costal community's as you go south to San Diego will have more money to pump into their districts.
