"So many places gone. 

The Barnes & Noble in Bay Terrace, followed by the one near St. John’s. I loved going there so much.

Douglaston Plaza - Toys R Us. The toys section in stores like Target or Walmart just don’t hit the same. I’ll never forget the feeling of wandering through the Barbie aisle or racing over to the video game section. Heck, nearly everything in Douglaston Plaza from that time is basically gone. Do they have plans to do anything with it? 

Flushing - Honestly countless places that I miss but can’t remember the names anymore. So many delicious Cantonese banquet-style restaurants are gone. Almost every municipal parking lot is gone too. I always remember frequenting a Taiwanese restaurant somewhere on Prince Street that had stinky tofu and shaved ice served in styrofoam cups. I remember the smell lol. I remember when Flushing Mall opened. That was an interesting place. I miss the food from there - sizzling pepper steak and noodles and ay chung rice noodles. Does anyone remember Assi Plaza? It was huge and it had its own food court. Many of the asian stationery stores are long and gone, such as Magic Castle. There was one place we LOVED going to, called something like Sweet n Tart Cafe in English, 糖朝 in Chinese. It had the yummiest scallion pancakes, wonton noodle soup, and bamboo container rice. I remember the wait being SUPER long every time we wanted to go there, and then all of a sudden it closed. 

Bayside - Morning Glory on Springfield Blvd. THE SUPER OLD-SCHOOL MCDONALDS!! I remember the OG Dunkin Donuts spot on Springfield that became a Donut Connection. The current one used to be a Blockbuster which I miss too!

"I’ve been super pissed about this forever now. Why the hell did the city think it was a good idea to sell almost all their municipal lots for private condominiums?! 

The big lot would have served a better purpose if it was turned into a multi-level bus terminal with levels for public parking. Since Flushing is a safe haven for immigrants who may not know English well, all you have to tell them is to go to the bus terminal to find their bus. It would immensely improve traffic conditions by centralizing the bus traffic by dispersing them through different side streets (this was pre-bus lane Main St) rather than give them a sprawling clusterfuck of different bus stops around the downtown Flushing area.

"It could conceivably be a nice small multiplex at some point in the future, like the one in Kew Gardens. It has one large space showing very dim random old movies, with what looks like a burlesque stage at the front, and several smaller spaces showing porn.

>I’m saying that it makes no sense a single dose of drugs costs more than decades of shelter, food, medical care, etc.

That's not what comprises the cost though.

There's an extensive appeals process for the death penalty. It takes *years*, sometimes decades to exhaust the court appeals to put someone the death. The court costs alone cost more than feeding and sheltering someone in prison for life. 

And the reason there's such extensive court processes is exactly because we don't want to accidentally kill an innocent person. 

Many, many people on death row have been exonerated when DNA evidence was introduced.

"you can put oz park in the F tier, man, it's okay, ive lived here my whole life and watched it tank through the decades.

resorts world is a trash palace. didnt revitalize the neighborhood at all like it was supposed to. only seemed to make it worse since it took away the aqueduct flea market and big A fair, which were big draws for families.

now ozpk is home to a lot of shuttered businesses and a growing homeless population. thanks to deblasio's administration, the christ lutheran church community center, another big neighborhood draw that used to have a dance academy, preschool, community theatre, and tons of community events, got sold to a shelter for the adult male homeless population. 100+ grown men, some with serious mental problems, located just three blocks away from an elementary school.

not safe to hang out even on your own front stoop anymore. crime is up 78% this year in ozone park alone, and its barely april. people leave garbage everywhere. a couple of winters ago someone defecated in our community driveway and left it there. disgusting.

sad to see my community turn into a dumpster fire, but thats what happens when big families move out and the local govt does nothing about transportation problems, high rent, struggling small businesses, and crumbling infrastructure. deblasio administration was corrupt as hell and let small communities like ours go to ruin to make a few bucks.

plus there are no family restaurants, no more movie theatres, comic book shops, or safe places where teenagers can congregate after school. even the karate school on 101 avenue closed down.

"You know zero about Queens especially ranking Jamaica as F. This looks more like your afraid to go into neighborhoods farther than Jackson Heights.

Manhattan doesn't equal NYC, you need to subject yourself to more culture and not what's trending. You also suspiciously ranked neighborhoods with higher minority populations D and below.

Rosedale is after Jamaica going toward Green Acres and Long Island. Queens Village is also after Jamaica but following Hillside Avenue below Glendale / Douglaston.

Laurelton, Springfield Garden, Hollis, St. Albans. Unbelievable.

Calling Hollis Unsafe when it's primarily an older neighborhood with an older population.

"Responding to a year-old post at 3 am. Clearly a busy man. Respectfully, you don’t deserve a response, but I’ll give it to you anyway because people need to be explained why they’re wrong sometimes. 

I’m originally from Howard Beach. It’s predominantly Irish and Italian, but there are also now black families who live there, in addition to Asian, Puerto Rican, etc.

 Phil was not and is not in the mafia. He’s a retired firefighter who had a small contracting business. You have no support for your dumb statement because it’s simply not true. You watch too much TV. 

There is no “Howard Beach Police”. Howard Beach is in Queens, one of the five boroughs and hence it’s under the jurisdiction of the NYPD, specifically the 106th precinct. The 106 covers ozone park, Howard beach, Woodhaven, Aqueduct Racetrack, parts of South Ozone Park, Howard Beach, Lindenwood and Hamilton Beach. The cops spend less time in Howard Beach compared to the other neighborhoods, because there’s more crime in the other neighborhoods. The idea that black people aren’t allowed in Howard Beach is asinine and obviously not something you’ve seen/experienced firsthand because it’s just not true. It may have been told to you by a dumb friend or family member. If someone of any creed acts like an asshole in Howard Beach, somebody will say something, but 1986 was almost 40 years ago. All this is irrelevant though, because I believe your point is that a black person couldnt get into Howard Beach, but the attack happened in the outskirts of Howard Beach in the Gateway Federal Park- a marsh that extends from Howard Beach to Starret Spring Creek and East NY (where Channel lived). 

 As for her father finding her body, from what I’ve read the helicopter light stopped scanning and landed on her body. It’s not like he was bloodhound charging through the fields and found her body. Your loose handle on grammar and incomplete thoughts aside, your statements don’t add up to anything even remotely suspicious. Are you saying that Katrina was killed by her father because he’s in the mafia? Well, that doesn’t make sense. Are you saying that Someone in the mafia killed Karina and told Phil where the body was? That’s slightly less idiotic because it’s a semblance of a complete idea, but still makes no sense. Phil and his daughter ran together on that route every day. He knew where to generally lead the police. A CC camera caught Karina running alone a few minute before her death. 

Channel’s DNA is all over Karina and her phone. Is it possible that he found her body after she was already dead? Yeah, I can’t say it’s not possible, but then why did he go to the hospital with scratches the day of Karina’s murder? Did the mafia frame a mentally handicapped person by scratching him up after killing Karina? The hospital visit pushes it beyond a reasonable doubt.

If you’ve never hear of Occam’s razor, look it up. Also, watch less TV and maybe hang out with smarter people.

"From my mom: ""Sunday, March 27 we went to flushing to have a dim sum,  the restaurant name is Asian jewels  seafood restaurant,  located in 133-30 39th Ave ., Queens , at the intersection of 39th and Roosevelt Ave. It  was crowded ,  supposed to be very good food,  we waited about a half hour and got a table  in the second dining area, right near the parking lot side entrance close to its bathroom,  then  put my backpack right in between our seats  on the floor. At around 11:30   When we were ordering from the cart ,  the  guy in the video just took my bag and walked away. The cctv caught the whole action…at least two men were working together. Police were notified, they said chances of finding these guys were low. There are cameras in the parking lot that the thieves exited to. But the NYPD officer that responded to the crime bluntly told us that he got another call for another robbery that he has to go to and that this stuff happens all the time and he doesn't have time to fully investigate this. He also said because they were wearing masks, it's more difficult to identify them. All he did was write down some info for a police report that will be mailed to us, and that's it. I'm sure if NYPD wanted to, they can get all the camera footage from around the area and solve this crime, but they're just too understaffed/inefficient to handle all the incidents. What can ya do...I’m not expecting to catch these guys. But please contact me with any info. (412) 465-0665""

"Just to clarify: Long Island City *is* a neighborhood in Queens. Western Queens, to be specific, and in very close proximity to Manhattan.

I know it’s confusing because of the association with Long Island. Queens and Brooklyn are both part of New York City, however, they are both *geographically* located on Long Island. Although, to make matters more confusing, Queens and Brooklyn aren’t really considered part of the Long Island “region” to native New Yorkers.
