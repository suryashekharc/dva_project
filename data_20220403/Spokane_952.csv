"I grew up here and went to LA for the first time in my life this year. The thing I noticed right away in LA is that people drive way more aggressively, but EVERYBODY drives like that there, so people don't get mad when they're cut off or tailgated; it's just how you drive there.

People don't drive like that here, so they get irritated when somebody rides their ass or cuts them off. I'd guess you're used to CA driving and don't notice you're driving in a way that aggravates others. That certainly doesn't justify violence or road rage but we do have a lot of big, lifted truck bros with tiny, fragile egos.

I never resort to road rage, but I gotta say, I really really hate people driving aggressive around me. I try to be safe, leave space for people to merge, etc so it bothers me when other people can't do the same. In LA, I had to completely abandon my Spokane mindset and be aggressive, otherwise I'd never get anywhere.",t2_6k0hk0sd,antron2000,0,1649012998.0,0,t1_i39a38o,i39a38o,True,Alzolay_collector,t3_tutfeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tutfeu/ive_experienced_more_road_rage_and_aggressive/,ive experienced more road rage and aggressive drivers in my 5 years living here than 20+ years in Southern California. please explain spokane,/r/Spokane/comments/tutfeu/ive_experienced_more_road_rage_and_aggressive/i39a38o/,1,r/Spokane,0,1

"Spokane drivers do not cooperate as they have learned to in bigger cities.  Allowing a car to merge in front of you especially when it is of no inconvenience is necessary for smooth traffic flow but in Spokane, that doesn't happen.  Instead of allowing you to merge into their spot, the Spokane driver will zip up and close the space.  

Here's some rules to go by:

(1) In Washington, it is legal to turn from a two-way onto a one-way at a red light, either direction.  So if you're at a light on Indiana and you want to turn left onto Division Southbound, and no-one's coming down Division, GO!  DON'T WAIT!  I have rarely seen anyone else take advantage of this allowance.

If you doubt it's legal, then take a look at the ""no turn on RED"" signs located at Riverside and Monroe - that is an example of where you CANNOT turn on a red light.  How about at the Altamont underpass?  ""No turn on RED"" signs all over that have no applicability otherwise.

(2) If you are entering the street from a driveway and have to cross traffic, and some asshat driver is actually accelerating so you'll hurry and get out of the way, slow way down!  Let them hit you, just the rear part of the car if you're careful.  Jackpot!! $$$$

(3) When entering an arterial from a side-street, and there's hundreds of feet before the next car arrives, go ahead and enter the lane - it's not like the other driver's going to keep going the same rate of speed and run into you!  (You have to judge this possibility).  Go as slow as you'd like!  Do not play game this with motorcycles or you might be sued civilly for a death.

(4) When at a yellow light and waiting to turn left, be in the center of the intersection so when the light does turn red, you have all day to vacate your spot!  Better yet, move up far enough so the guy behind you will be in the intersection as well (nose past the crosswalk) - get TWO cars through when the light turns red.  DO NOT sit behind the crosswalk so you have to wait yet another round of traffic signals!!  

(5) When merging onto a single lane, let cars merge - and merge in zipper fashion.  If you are having difficulty getting in, push - let them hit you.  Jackpot!! $$$$

(6) Many times I've seen someone in a hurry swerving, passing cars, causing minor havoc  only to end up behind them at the light even though I was proceeding leisurely.  There's never really any time saved.

(7) Get a dash cam so you can prove you weren't the aggressor.",t2_djps0oya,pillowmite,0,1649006722.0,0,t1_i38uvj4,i38uvj4,True,Alzolay_collector,t3_tutfeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tutfeu/ive_experienced_more_road_rage_and_aggressive/,ive experienced more road rage and aggressive drivers in my 5 years living here than 20+ years in Southern California. please explain spokane,/r/Spokane/comments/tutfeu/ive_experienced_more_road_rage_and_aggressive/i38uvj4/,1,r/Spokane,0,1

"So…I’m from here, learned to drive here (both city and rural), moved away and spent the next 15 years driving in SoCal (San Diego and LA, Oregon (Eugene and Portland), and Seattle (proper and suburbs). 

I’ve also traveled for work and spent a LOT of time driving around Phoenix, Chicago, Minneapolis, NYC, Atlanta, all over the Bay Area, etc. 

Overall, Spokane drivers aren’t better or worse than anywhere else. What I HAVE noticed a difference in between when I lived here before moving back, is an increase in population, with lots of people coming from somewhere else. Just the sheer number of additional people here statistically means there are going to be more road rage incidents. 

Also, we’ve been experiencing a population explosion and we haven’t invested in the infrastructure needed to support that kind of growth. We need to redo many of our roads to help people get around, we need to invest in protected bike routes, there’s not enough housing, and on and on. Traffic clogs, people are late getting to places where they don’t want to be and can’t afford to be late to, and people are on edge and frayed. 

OP, I’m sure that as an Uber driver, you put in more miles per day than most people, and it’s just how it works that you’re going to experience more road rage than other people. That’s why you see it more and others don’t. It’s not that Spokane is worse than other places, we have a lot more people than our city can handle, and you’re meeting a lot more of them who are already pissed off.

These invaders will eat your plants out of sight all winter. Be warned, and keep an eye out!

It has some color variation, but reliable markings along the top sides. All those I've seen so far, however, within the past couple weeks (ie: late March), were more brownish on top, and perhaps just the slightest bit green on bottom.

 - it was a choice made by roughly (charitably) half of the population only (that is: women only), and very informally
 - the coast rhododendron naturally really prefers (a small part of) the coast only, and less commonly slightly elsewhere in western Washington but not really eastern, which means not only does it poorly represent Washington as a whole, but that from an actually-being-able-to-easily-plant perspective, very few counties in the state would have sensibly chosen it",t2_holu8pa,excelsiorsbanjo,0,1648994409.0,0,t1_i382fkk,i382fkk,False,thundersnow86,t3_tula3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tula3g/plant_people_i_need_advice/,Plant people I need advice.,/r/Spokane/comments/tula3g/plant_people_i_need_advice/i382fkk/,1,r/Spokane,0,1

"**[Republican Party (United States)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_\(United_States\))** 
 
 >The Republican Party, also referred to as the GOP (""Grand Old Party""), is one of the two major contemporary political parties in the United States, along with its main historic rival, the Democratic Party. The GOP was founded in 1854 by opponents of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, which allowed for the potential expansion of chattel slavery into the western territories. It was simultaneously strengthened by the collapse of the Whig Party, which had previously been one of the two major parties in the country. Upon founding, the Republican party supported economic reform and classical liberalism while opposing the expansion of slavery.

"> I go to medical school and vote GOP

As someone in mental health, married to someone in pharmacy, who was raised by a surgeon… why?

It’s not the 90’s, privatized healthcare doesn’t mean you get your own practice. It means you have to jump through hoops to get your patient’s insurance to approve the scan you know they need so that you can help them stop being in pain.

Not that the Dems are necessarily more willing to implement a more reasonable way to pay for healthcare (I got my differences with Bernie too), but why vote for someone actively hostile to letting you bill more patients or (because you’re a med student and want to heal people) treat patients according to best practice?

"One thing I would add is that, having driven in Spokane for about 20 years (including professional driving that allowed me to experience pretty much every neighborhood, arterial and highway in the county): it does feel like an inordinate amount of drivers don’t use turn signals at all here, and the majority of those who do use them improperly.

Signaling after you’ve already braked or are already mid-turn or after/as you merge does not count as an indicator because it’s too late at that point. The most noticeable commonality that I’ve seen over the years is easily the vast majority of bigger trucks and SUVs just never using their signals at all, even in winter conditions. I’m not talking about a bit of laziness: I mean these drivers clearly are not in the habit of signaling. Their hand never goes near it even if a cop is around. 

It also seems like turn signal use is under-enforced.  I’ve seen cops in traffic either not notice or not care while drivers all around and ahead of them are barely signaling or not signaling at all. It’s likely that most of these people who don’t signal have just gotten away with it their whole lives, never being by anyone that they should do it, and never being ticketed or even warned for it.

The thing is, it’s extremely important for a host of reasons to use turn signals early and often to indicate your intentions to other drivers, particularly on the freeway or when driving on snow and ice.",t2_a9uto48s,bonerbang420,0,1648950243.0,0,t1_i3672oc,i3672oc,False,Alzolay_collector,t3_tutfeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tutfeu/ive_experienced_more_road_rage_and_aggressive/,ive experienced more road rage and aggressive drivers in my 5 years living here than 20+ years in Southern California. please explain spokane,/r/Spokane/comments/tutfeu/ive_experienced_more_road_rage_and_aggressive/i3672oc/,1,r/Spokane,0,1

I was waiting outside a bbq joint where I ate lunch for my uber. There was a 4 way stop.

A fourth car attempted to ignore the stop and nearly t-boned a car that had the right away. Scary stuff. My uber driver told me people lost their god for saken minds in the last two years and the driving I witnessed was reflective of what to expect. Honestly, that worries me.

More people in a given region means more of everything: more traffic, more angry drivers, more drunk drivers, more car accidents, but also more calm drivers, more safe drivers, more defensive drivers.

Add to that the existing stereotype of “Idaho drivers” — which I do feel is based somewhat in truth: it’s far less metropolitan in nearly all of Idaho, so people live their lives driving on more country roads and highways and are less prepared when maneuvering im heavy traffic or when something unexpected occurs. Learning to drive and driving for years in cities is very different and produces far better and safer drivers in every way.

"Eastern WA has a special breed of passive-aggressive drivers that are unique to the area.  

If you use a turn signal to change lanes, that simply makes people close the gap so you cannot change lanes.  Apparently pulling into a lane in front of a driver is an insult. 

They will travel the inside right lane on I90 through town at 53 mph clogging up traffic trying to exit and enter the freeway.  Almost everywhere else I’ve driven understands that during heavy traffic in areas with multiple on-ramps/off-ramps to use the left lanes for thru-traffic and leave the right lane for entering/exiting and allowing traffic from the right lane to merge with the thru-traffic.  (See above)

Also, they like to bunch up in groups.  They’ll speed right up to your bumper but not pass.  I’ve had cars chase me down on I90 for miles only to never pass.  When I speed up to create some space, the speed up again to stay close.  I think they’re afraid of being alone?

"Yup, gotta agree with mza on this one.  I’ve seen horrific bad drivers and traffic on east and west coast.  Spokanes pretty chill until maybe 2 years ago.  Driving here like they do in the big city is just a recipe for disaster.  There’s a couple of things that take getting used to with the roads here, but it’s not hard.  What makes it tricky is when someone new doesn’t realize the lane cuts down from two lanes to one lane and just start getting aggressive.  If you can anticipate where you need to be in traffic and avoid being sporadic it goes a long way.

I’ve also had great experiences with people in collision situations.  Just very pleasant people and earnest in making things right.  You have to keep in mind hit and runs come from things like legal status, lack of insurance or license, drugs, other shady shit.

"Pear Lake or Blossom Lakes on the Idaho Montana border, northeast of Wallace. There's almost never anyone there, and it's not too difficult to hike and it's an easy drive. No permit unless that's changed, I'm not sure which state either lake is in for fishing license purposes or if they're stocked. 

Lotta the lakes other folks mentioned in North Idaho are definitely awesome and worth hiking to, but they get pretty crowded once the snow melts.


If you're willing to drive a bit further, North Cascades NP from the Winthrop side and adjacent forest service land to the east of it is a backpacking mecca, more crowded than here, but tends to be less crowded than other areas of the cascades.

If you have species questions about permits, feel free to DM, I worked for the forest service for 6 years and if I don't know the answer I can def help you figure out, and should be able to get some intel if the trails/roads are currently snow free or not. 

The Pacific Northwest forests app is also a great resource.

"Mint is fine for some.

"There's a good episode on the Criminal podcast called, ""If it Ever Happens, Run.""  It's just a quick hour to kind of understand what they're trying to talk about.  They're twisting it around to try to mean something else, but it was interesting, imo.  (not about slavery, but about racism and politics and how the republicans were ""different"" back then)

Politics is dirty, period.

A short rundown is that you can join groups for discounted service as If you were on a family plan, but it's with strangers. None of your info is shared with theirs, you are just in the same group together. If you were to go on Visible just for yourself you would pay $40, group of 2-$35, group of 3-$30, 4 and above you pay $25.

"The modern German state has only existed since 1949. Since 1871 there have been three discontinuous states that we have called Germany. German Empire (1871-1918), Weimar/Nazi (1918-1945), and Federal Republic (1949-present). Changing their political system was a very important part of shedding off the naziism and allowing them to become normal and great. We simply call them Germany because it's easier and covers roughly the same people/extents as previous iterations of German statehood.    


For example, there was a ""Republican party"" founded by Thomas Jefferson that historians have called the ""Democratic-Republicans"", even though they always called themselves the Republican party, but we recognize this party as a separate entity altogether from the modern Republican party.

"into power in the South. They quickly reestablished white supremacy across the region with 
measures like black codes – laws that restricted the ability of blacks to own property and run 
businesses. And they imposed poll taxes and literacy tests, used to subvert the black citizen’s 
right to vote.
And how was all of this enforced? By terror -- much of it instigated by the Ku Klux Klan, 
founded by a Democrat, Nathan Bedford Forrest. 
As historian Eric Foner - himself a Democrat - notes:
“In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic Party.”
President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, shared many views with the Klan. He re-segregated 
many federal agencies, and even screened the first movie ever played at the White House - 
the racist film “The Birth of a Nation,” originally entitled “The Clansman.”
A few decades later, the only serious congressional opposition to the landmark Civil Rights Act 
of 1964 came from Democrats.
Eighty percent of Republicans in Congress supported the bill. Less than 70 percent of 
Democrats did. Democratic senators filibustered the bill for 75 days, until Republicans 
mustered the few extra votes needed to break the logjam.
And when all of their efforts to enslave blacks, keep them enslaved, and then keep them from 
voting had failed, the Democrats came up with a new strategy: If black people are going to 
vote, they might as well vote for Democrats. As President Lyndon Johnson was purported to 
have said about the Civil Rights Act, “I’ll have them n*****s voting Democrat for two hundred 
years.” 
So now, the Democratic Party prospers on the votes of the very people it has spent much of 
its history oppressing. 
Democrats falsely claim that the Republican Party is the villain, when in reality it’s the failed 
policies of the Democratic Party that have kept blacks down. Massive government welfare 
has decimated the black family. Opposition to school choice has kept them trapped in failing 
schools. Politically correct policing has left black neighborhoods defenseless against violent 
crime. 
So, when you think about racial equality and civil rights, which political party should come to 
mind?

"When you think about racial equality and civil rights, which political party comes to mind? The 
Republicans? Or, the Democrats? Most people would probably say the Democrats. But this 
answer is incorrect. 
Since its founding in 1829, the Democratic Party has fought against every major civil rights 
initiative, and has a long history of discrimination. 
The Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed Reconstruction, 
founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynchings, and fought against 
the civil rights acts of the 1950s and 1960s. 
In contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission 
was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territories with the aim of abolishing it 
entirely. This effort, however, was dealt a major blow by the Supreme Court. In the 1857 case 
Dred Scott v. Sandford, the court ruled that slaves aren’t citizens; they’re property. The seven 
justices who voted in favor of slavery? All Democrats. The two justices who dissented? Both 
Republicans.
The slavery question was, of course, ultimately resolved by a bloody civil war. The commander-
in-chief during that war was the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln – the man who 
freed the slaves. 
Six days after the Confederate army surrendered, John Wilkes Booth, a Democrat, assassinated 
President Lincoln. Lincoln’s vice president, a Democrat named Andrew Johnson, assumed 
the presidency. But Johnson adamantly opposed Lincoln’s plan to integrate the newly freed 
slaves into the South’s economic and social order. 
Johnson and the Democratic Party were unified in their opposition to the 13th Amendment, 
which abolished slavery; the 14th Amendment, which gave blacks citizenship; and the 
15th Amendment, which gave blacks the vote. All three passed only because of universal 
Republican support.
During the era of Reconstruction, federal troops stationed in the south helped secure rights for 
the newly freed slaves. Hundreds of black men were elected to southern state legislatures as 
Republicans, and 22 black Republicans served in the US Congress by 1900. The Democrats 
did not elect a black man to Congress until 1935.
But after Reconstruction ended, when the federal troops went home, Democrats roared back",t2_bltqa0tn,dilapidated2faded,0,1648908897.0,0,t1_i33yxmc,i33yxmc,True,wetblanketdreams,t3_tub6em,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spokane/comments/tub6em/they_really_dont_care_about_facts_at_this_point/,"They really don't care about facts at this point, do they....

Racism and Religion.

Racism is an outdated response to things that are different than us. We are no longer cavemen, scared of anything that looks or sounds different than us, and our behavior should reflect that.

Then we have the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , when the party's core base shifted, with the Southern states becoming more reliably Republican in presidential politics and the Northeastern states becoming more reliably Democratic. 

Following the Roe vs. Wade decision, the Republican Party opposed abortion in its party platform and grew its support among evangelists.

"Price fixing is actually really messy and dangerous.  When the government sets a price for something and it’s below the cost it takes to produce, it collapses the entire industry.  I’m not exaggerating when I say it was a big part of Venezuela’s economic collapse.

Insulin is a clear outlier though because it was clearly a racket where a tiny number of companies were fixing the price to begin with and the customers had no alternative options and would die if they didn’t buy it.

I’d support insulin price fixing but not other markets. Or ideally IMO the government should just fund the creation of a bunch of alternative insulin producers to drive the price down.

Also, I hate to say it, because it really hurts people like you and me; but rising gas prices are actually a good thing. We need less usage due to climate change.

"Yes! And, when I looked at the bullet holes in the clothing and entry wounds on his body, they were more consistent with his hands in the air like he was surrendering rather than attacking. 

Wallace’s story is pure bullshit. He was never interviewed by investigators and was able to give his written statement to the investigators a month after the shooting. 

Also, with the dropped knife contaminating the crime scene, it makes you wonder how many weapons might have been dropped at other crime scenes. We have a problem here with the sheriff’s office not preserving a sterile crime scene. 

SPD is just as bad! I just received records from the Jerome Alford case from when he was killed on 3/4/2007. On page 103 at the heading 1330 hrs, you will see Detective Dresback accidentally stepped on the shell casing that was fired from Officer Torok’s weapon.

It's just down to proper representation. Rural people don't like to have their votes swallowed by urban and vice versa.
