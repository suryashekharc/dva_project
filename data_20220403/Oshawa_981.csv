"I do think you would be wise to avoid Wentworth and Oxford Sts. in the south end. Just rough area all around. Mary & Nonquon gets a bad rap. It is a high density area and has the reputation of any high density area. I lived there for years, it's not so bad, and everything you could need is within walking distance, which is why I liked it. I don't see much in the way of racism towards any race in this area, it is slowly becoming much more diverse and as a result, much more tolerant. Is there racism? Sure. Is it improving? I'd say so.

Definitely walk around the area you're looking at. If you check out Wentworth, you'll understand without getting out of your car what kind of area you're in. People there can be friendly and all, I don't want to knock the people themselves, but the area is run down, dirty, and completely without pride of ownership. The area is low income. Come anywhere north of Taunton Rd and you get very different feel. Many big new homes, clean. Both areas have their own crime issues though.

Downtown is rough. Just the usual, drunks on weekends, bars letting out, homeless people. It seems like it's a bit of a food desert too. There isn't much in downtown for grabbing groceries and what is there is expensive.

"That fire, the 1989 one, was arson/insurance fraud IMO. The day it happened, I was riding my bike with a friend to his house on Bruce Street. As we rode by an entrance at the top of Gliddon, the doors were propped open and an anonymous white van was parked in front. Fittings had been completely shut down for a couple years at that point, so there was no reason for someone to go in there for normal operations. A couple hours after arriving at my friend's house, his sister came and told us that Fittings was on fire... It went up like a tinderbox. The stretch along Bruce street that I was in had wood floors supported by wood columns, and a wooden roof - this was built just before the Albert Kahn reinforced cement column grid era. There were bits of tar paper from it on the lawn at Eastdale CVI. 

Interesting map, where did you find that?? Love to see the rest of the pages. I'm guesstimating it's ca 1910-1920. My childhood home is just off this map, but looks like it and the area wasn't quite built yet (house was built 1929). Interestingly, many of the fire hydrants indicated there are still in the same place (on the streets, not in the vacant land)

* In my living memory, only the buildings that faced Bruce and Drew were still left, all the 'interior' buildings were already gone, my afore-mentioned friend's dad has photos of the demolition of them in the 70's
* the electric oven isn't showing on this map, it was right at Bruce and Drew, it looked like the newest part so not surprising
* the ""Tower"", the imposing tall black building at the south end of property (at the top of Eulalie), is not there
* Drew street runs along the east property line, it got cut out at some point and Huron Park appeared. It was cut at Huron Cr when I was a kid, looks like it's cut off at Eulalie now
* McKim runs right up to the property line, they cut it off at some point where the houses stopped. Wonder why that field was never developed... no concept of buffer zones then, I remember a house with the corner of it's porch cut off at Bruce and Ritson for the train to pass by.
* Eulalie ends at Drew, that little stub down to James St isn't there

* Other stuff - I wonder what that ""public school"" on Albert street was, I remember it being an open lot with a long building with lots of garage doors (like a storage place) at the very back of the lot... then the current apartment building was put up in the mid 80's or so
* I didn't know there was a Prospect street, that was defo where Oshawa Railway (then later CNR) ran their freight service down to the GT/CNR, CPR tracks - in any photos dating back to the 50's it's only ever been rail going through there.
* Lot of earlier versions of businesses I remember... the Orange Hall on Bruce... Victoria Apartments called out there...

"That land is cursed. Well, polluted beyond belief, actually. They might just be running the clock down, waiting for nature to take its course and the pollution to dissipate. 

TL;DR for anyone who doesn't know: there was a factory there (Fittings Limited), long torn down (~1990 or so), that dumped some really nasty Love Canal-level crap on the site. 

Story time: To get rid of expended cutting oil, they used to put barrels of it on the back of a truck, punch a hole in it then drive around the gravel parking lot to keep the dust down as well as ditch the oil. Common practice back then. Another story, not directly related to the site itself, but gives a sense of what went on: On weekend nights, when the residents and the MOE was asleep, they did some kind of process that stank like fuck and smoked the area out. All the houses to the east of it on Huron, Tylor and Clarke were stained by this fly ash that you couldn't wash off your siding/plastic lawn furniture/etc. Lots of cancer deaths in that little area. And let's not talk about the 'pond' (a chemical dump) - even though they dug down a long way and pulled out TONS of dirt you can still see where it was on Google Maps because stuff doesn't want to grow there. The skin on my brother's foot has never been the same since it went through the ice and into that water one winter 30 years ago.

There've been numerous development proposals over the years, but when it comes to remediation efforts and associated costs, the proposals seem go away and the developer sells the land. 20+ years ago there was talk of mixed density affordable housing - townhouses, a low-rise apartment building - all the hot button topics of today, but they've never come to pass.

"I hope you enjoy your tour of DC. The college holds a special place in my heart.

North End Bowl has evolved significantly. Many others here have already mentioned it.

[https://nebsfunworld.com/](https://nebsfunworld.com/) \- If you want, you can book a lane in advance so you can be sure to access bowling. Otherwise, there are go-karts, VR stations, an arcade, a bar, etc.

If you just want to take in a few different things the city/region has to offer, you can check out places like Brew Wizards, Deadly Grounds in Courtice, 8-Bit Beans in Whitby (This is an arcade and cafe!).

The downside is that DC is a little bit off the beaten path from entertainment for the most part. I think that will change quite a bit in the coming years with the growing development in the area.

"I had lived in Oshawa a very long time, from 7-33, and I don’t remember anywhere having any stories of being haunted. Possibly the old houses at the lakefront? 

I have lived through many creepy situations though that I would have rather avoided that didn’t include hauntings. I feel haunted if that counts.

Outside Oshawa though, I’ve visited the old ghost road in port perry and seen the weird car light ghost thing.
There’s what looks like an old summer camp north of the city, not samac, and it’s around this railway track that moves your car if that sounds familiar to anyone? My old buddy used to drive up there and a bunch of us would smoke a joint and hang out. I remember so many creepy sounds like children and things up there. I was again smoking a joint though so that could all be in my head.
If camp 30 is at all accessible anymore that place was something else and definitely felt haunted at night with how creepy it was especially that basement and the hallway with the little closet rooms.

I'm assuming this is 885 oxford or 835 oxford  by the  flooring or 275 Wentworth.  An option you always have is contacting the city of oshawa to come do a property standards inspection. For an idea.

"My Clayborne family moved from Canada in the 60s-70s. Murray was just a kid. I was born in South Carolina, but my mother- his sister was born in Canada. My uncle never went by as being a Canadian. Matter of fact, he changed his name to Mohamed once he got settled in Saudi. It’s weird to me that he’s now using the name my gma Maisie Clayborne gave him now… My gma, uncle Bruce- Murray’s brother and my gma were all into tele- communications. Murray was always into a bit of trouble. I was young, but I’m sure my grandparents were aware of Murray’s demons. Do I think they felt those demons would unleash on any of the kids- no! But, it did. My nanny (gma) lived in a small single wide. We had family guests from Florida. So there were only three rooms. I had to sleep with my uncle- Murray. I was 6-7. He treated me as his gf. I was disgusted and afraid. It was just him and I in and room and he was taking advantage of me at such a fragile age. I told my grandma and mom the next morning. The era in the 80s was more so hush hush. They wanted me to forget about it, act as if it didn’t happen. Let me also express that I am mixed. All the other Clayborne’s were blonde and blue. So, I was the one that experienced all the torture. I will never forget u Murray. I am actually so filled with emotion tonight. My cousin- David’s son sent me this clip of you being stuck Murray. I’ve never thought of u honestly I’m 33 years. And, today, I’m filled with anger, memories and a sense of relief to see that Karma has not skipped you. Your son which is my cousin said he hasn’t spoke to you in 15 years and you called and asked him for thousands. If you ask me, Murray got into some things and needs to flee. He’s a flee’r when things hit the fan. I don’t think Murray ever worked in tele communications, I think it was an easy thought because that’s what “the family” always worked in from my nanny, mom and Uncle Bruce. I also truly, whole heartedly believe that when u fled, u went to be with other more easily accessible children.

I’ll leave with this… My nanny who was my everything hurt… she hurt because she never got to see you do right, she hurt because you left and she hurt because you hurt her granddaughter! Me!

2) Don't make the turn onto Naples there just because someone gives you a wave through. It's not safe just because they wave you. Multiple times a year, somebody writes off their car because the vehicle in the second lane doesn't see you coming.

"Sitting on a vacant property is bad business. 0

Let's see if i can break it down for you.

Say it's a $800,000 house. The owner puts 20% down and mortgage is $640,000 at a cost of $3028 a month at 3% over 25 years.

Property taxes would be around $3600 a year or about $300 a month.

Insurance on a rental like that would be about $180-$200 a month.

So let's say the 2 bedroom upstairs rents for $2200, and the basement 2 bedroom rents for $1800.

Total cost (not including incidentals) is $3500.

Total income is $4000 a month

Profit: $500

So say they didn't rent it out for 12 months. That means that year there was a net loss of $48,000. Meaning at $500 profit, they wouldn't be out of the red for 8 years.

Most owners would gladly accept lower rent just to keep the building occupied but when you have 40 applications for 1 property, you may as well jack the price as the demand is going to be the determining factor in the price. As long as a couple of those people are willing to pay the inflated prices, they will continually go up.

If a listing is put in, and they don't fill the vacancy, you'll see the price reduced to their break even. If it gets to the point where they still can't rent, they'll sell to recoupe costs.

The vast majority of properties value comes with holding for 10 years and then liquidating. As long as the property still remains cost neutral, that's fine for buyers.",t2_4dknyaqe,MikeTheMic81,0,1648080038.0,0,t1_i1v7s0g,i1v7s0g,False,lovesilver,t3_tkw8y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Oshawa/comments/tkw8y6/21storey_tower_planned_for_king_and_mary_in_oshawa/,21-storey tower planned for King and Mary in Oshawa,/r/Oshawa/comments/tkw8y6/21storey_tower_planned_for_king_and_mary_in_oshawa/i1v7s0g/,3,r/Oshawa,0,3

"Brew Wizards in Oshawa board game cafe is run by friendly people with craft beer and coffee, if you like board games. 8Bit coffee in Whitby is the same bit with pinball and videogame machines.   
If you're into live music the Atria is ""rough around the edges"" but not a bad spot for metal and punk. The Biltmore is a bigger place and gets more established acts, but they used to have a monthly funk night that was banging, definately check that out if it comes back.  Oshawa music hall is planning on being a new live venue but hasn't opened yet.   
The art gallery downtown Oshawa used to have an open friday night event with a bar and live music once a month. Very friendly crowd with a great gallery, easy to make friends there.  
Covid pretty much turned this city to a social ghost town, but if everything opens up I can a more entertaining environment returning.   
Other things to check out is the Oshawa Art Association events, Town Brewery, Little Beasts Brewery in Whitby, Manantler Brewery in Bowmanville.

"I’m always cynical about this sort of thing, fearing that a company that advertises testing for something is likely to find it and recommend immediate and expensive treatment.  This company may be legit, and they seem to have good reviews on google though.
Here’s what I suggest:  If you search for Guide For Radon Measurements in Residential Dwellings there is excellent info on Canada.ca.  I highly recommend you review this so you can understand the results.  Testing should take a long time (months) and is best performed in the winter.  There are places you should never place a detector and it’s best if it’s checked by a certified lab.  It’s also important that you are testing an area that you commonly use.  It’s likely high in your basement, but if you are rarely in your basement, does it matter?  Once you have a bit of knowledge you can better determine if the testing company is honest or not when they explain what they are going to do.

Escooter tech ""share"" companies are to blame for the rise in hate for these and the conversation needs to revolve around banning them from operating.

"For your last point it's no rent control for buildings made after 2018. The reasoning for that was the Tories claimed rent control disincentivized people from building new rental stock. Which I'm not entirely sold on but even if it was true it still ignores the much bigger issue of councils and voters blocking or slowing down the building of new rental stock due to zoning issues. 

So sure with no rent control developers might be more incentivized to build apartments/townhomes but the one place they want to build (GTA) they can't do so with most of it being zoned for single family housing only.

"I'll repeat what I said in r/canadahousing:

>The main reason for this is a massive influx of people from other GTA cities and international students while NIMBYs have ruled local government for decades largely vetoing any new apartment building. Most of the ones that do exist were built before the mid 1990s.  
>  
>The only major rental development is near DC/UOIT. It took a decade of illegal slum land lording in the surrounding single family zoned housing and the many complaints from local residents for council to actually do something. Even then that housing is only for students and doesn't meet the demand from other groups. Though they did build 2 retirement apartment complexes in the north end (but only after developing 99% of the land for single family housing).  
>  
>Feds doing everything to increase demand for housing while local governments refuse to rezone or build is a terrible thing that must come to an end. It's absurd this has allowed to go on for essentially 3 decades now.You can't expect renters to absorb ever rising rents like this.

TL;DR: Blame city council for not thinking long term and being stuck in this vision of Oshawa only being single family homes filled with families with kids.

Now the single family homes are still there but any on sale now are all getting bought out by mom & pop landlords/RE investors to turn into de facto rental housing. Even if neighborhoods weren't planned for this.

I mean just take a look at the homes in North Oshawa with their tiny driveways and no space for parking. But hey I guess as long as everything looks the same as it did visually in the 1980s everything is fine according to council and NIMBYs.

(That’s just one example.)

I calmly asked them to be a little more gentle the following week and mentioned that I watched them laughing about it on video and they proceeded to lecture me on how I never have a green bin out and I am clearly throwing out compost items. 

I explained I have a giant composter in my backyard (visible from where we were standing) and that the rare time I have meat bones in my house from guests, my neighbour lets me put it in his green bin.

">it's not like I'm looking for advice. Just clarity on why some people act thay way.

You'll drive yourself crazy trying to figure this out.

These bins are made of cheap plastic that is expected to withstand elements ranging from -30c to +30c. They're going to break eventually and there could be conditions that cause them to be far more brittle than usual.

They'll replace your bins at no charge to you. Sure it's a pain in the ass but that's a pretty good problem to have.

"Durham Waste asks that we don't bag our recycling. From their [website](https://www.durham.ca/en/living-here/garbage-recycling-green-bin-and-other-collection.aspx#Extra-or-replacement-boxes-and-bins): ""Recycling must be loose inside your Blue Box, not in plastic bags. Recycling set out in plastic bags will not be collected.""       

Our collector sometimes throws our bins down with more force than necessary and our containers bin has a chunk out of the lip as a result. Our house is slightly recessed by about a meter compared to other houses and it's an end house which understandably puts our bins just out of a collector's eye-line if they don't back up to the end of the street. Collectors often miss us and I've had to have them come back multiple times to collect what we put out so perhaps there is some animosity from our collector leading to some angry bin handling.

"The problem is Oshawa is a huge vote splitting riding hence why Colin keeps getting back in. When you can see it in the polling within these past election results you can see the NDP/Liberals splitting the vote which is why Colin keeps getting elected. I think this why Colin keeps getting in is because both Liberals/NDP split causing him to be re-elected every single time. I honestly feel like there should be term limits regardless of MP. Too many of these politicians make it their career.

At a glance, it seems like a solid alternative for people who don't want/need/can't afford an automobile, transit, etc. People should have the freedom to dictate their means of transportation when they can't reasonably justify other alternatives. There are certainly people out there who can't even afford the monthly bus pass fees or the daily fares on DRT. Maybe this is a solid alternative.

I know it's not so black and white because I'm sure it's a question of whether or not Oshawa has the infrastructure to implement this with regards to roads/sidewalks or whatever.. but it's not a bad idea when gas is pushing $2/L.
