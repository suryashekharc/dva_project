"This is a really good point, thanks for bringing it up. Funding is a big issue to solve with DART. Most of the problems associated with DART—infrequent trains and buses, everything behind schedule, poorly maintained rolling stock and stations—could largely be solved by much better funding and planning. 

I don't think Texas would ever loosen the sales tax cap as a matter of political will and the unpopularity of raising such a  common tax. An alternate revenue stream would be needed.

In my opinion, a tax scheme targeting road transportation would be the most effective. Tax parking companies at higher rates. Introduce a comprehensive gas guzzler tax (God knows we need to disincentivize huge pickups and SUVs). Moving funding away from road expansions is also needed—no more expanding the Katy Freeway or I-35.

"From behind the paywall: 

>On Dec. 4, 2017, Collin County Deputy Sheriff Robert Merritt conducted a traffic stop along U.S. 75 north of McKinney. The motorist, a 45-year-old Black man named Ronnie Brown, was driving alone. He said he was on his way to the night shift at work, and that he was stopped for a missing light on his license plate. Riding along with Merritt was a civilian named Leos Drbohlav, a dog trainer who works with the department’s K-9 units.  
>  
>In dashcam footage of the stop, Drbohlav is seen wearing a tactical vest marked “POLICE” on front and back. He carries a holstered sidearm. Merritt and Drbohlav search Brown’s car, which Brown said he consented to. At one point, Merritt comes away from the car, leaving Drbohlav to search alone. Drbohlav is not a sworn peace officer. According to multiple sources, he is from the Czech Republic and not an American citizen. We spoke to Drbohlav briefly by phone, but when we asked about his citizenship status, the line went dead. He has not responded to multiple attempts to contact him since then.  
>  
>Civilians are not allowed to pose as police officers or participate in police searches. The sheriff department’s own internal policy on ride-alongs forbids them to carry firearms, give the impression that they are police, use police equipment or participate in an investigation. The 2017 stop broke all those rules.  
>  
>“There is a law against impersonating a police officer,” Tittle said. “We’ve all heard about that, but that law is actually on the books.” Fortunately, any escalation was avoided once patrol Sgt. Russell Driver arrived. When he discovered what was happening, he said, he told Merritt to let Brown go. Then he reprimanded Merritt and Drbohlav and ordered the ride-along over, he told us.  
>  
>Driver retired in 2019 and now lives in Washington state. He told us his frustration over the way the department handled this incident contributed to his decision to leave the force.  
>  
>In 2019 an anonymous whistleblower loaded 16 thumb drives with the dashcam footage and mailed one to every judge and commissioner in the county along with a letter signed “concerned citizen.”  
>  
>Weeks later, after multiple complaints from judges, and more than a week after IT had determined the thumb drives to be safe, they were returned, the sources said. The returned footage contained no audio.  
>  
>This isn’t just about the letter of the law (though it appears that was broken). It’s about leadership and sending a clear message about what behavior will be tolerated. To preserve public confidence, Skinner should be bending over backward to answer questions and support his answers with documentation. The public should have gotten this information four years ago, along with an apology and a plan to improve.

If you stay with Spectrum I would highly suggest you get your own router (even if you get Frontier too honestly), something Wifi6 (look for AX when shopping) from Asus or TP-Link.How expensive it will be depends on the number of people in your home and square footage.

Do you think the dogs just hop in their Hyundai’s and take themselves to the dog park? Are soccer fields only for soccer balls?

Just like a soccer field is for PEOPLE to play soccer, dog parks are for dog owners (people, including kids!) to take their dogs and socialize with other dog owners (also people) and their dogs.

"I'm going to address a few of these things. 

1. From the FURTHEST end of AHS I can walk to visit teachers on the other furthest end in under 5 minutes. 
2. The high school is no longer one way hallways. That was a covid mitigation idea last year and the signs are no longer in place. 
3. Sports DO have an impact on student learning. There are lots of studies about the benefit of being a student athlete, and to that argument, just being in any form of extra curricular. 
4. The opposite can be said for small schools. Not sure what the right answer is or that there really is an answer. AHS has amazing opportunity for students, many of which are not THAT competitive. If you want to be there starting QB on Friday night that's a pretty tough spot to get to. If you want to PLAY football, there's a spot on the team. If you want to be the drum major of the largest marching band, that's pretty difficult, if you want to march with 700 of your closest friends and play in one of the (8 or 9 I think, normal sized) concert bands, there IS a spot for you. Small schools don't have animation teams that win national awards, ROTC groups that get to travel to national competitions, and academics that are second to none. You pick and choose.

The reason Allen is a ""single high school"" city is because of the stupid football situation.  I don't want another football team, I want another high school.  In fact, let me list the errors of the ways of AISD.

1. 5 minutes between periods for one mile walk is not okay (one way because that is the current setup, no two way halls.  thanks covid)

2. Forcing students to take a bus between buildings, thereby forcing them to lose time for lunch or walking to class, is inappropriate and ludicrous.  This especially applies to transport to/from the STEAM center.

3. Building a ""STEAM"" center was idiotic.  That could have, very easily, been another high school without sports teams.  Sports are nice and all, but they have ABSOLUTELY no impact on students learning.

4. Packing that many students into a single school forces a contentious, and overly competitive, atmosphere.  This has not benefitted students that do not do well in that environment.  And yes, there are plenty that fall into that category (my oldest student being one of them).  They feel left behind and ignored.

I could go on, but those are the biggest issues in my opinion.",t2_h28ym,crymson7,1,1643316990.0,0,t1_huho4ap,huho4ap,False,starlocalmedia,t3_se4up7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allen/comments/se4up7/allens_first_public_dog_park_in_bidding_process/,"Allen's first public dog park in bidding process, parks officials announce",/r/Allen/comments/se4up7/allens_first_public_dog_park_in_bidding_process/huho4ap/,0,r/Allen,0,0

"This is a multi-faceted issue that isn't just as simple as one Wag's dropping the ball. Relax for a second and think of the big picture.

We're soaking in the Great Resignation. People are quitting their jobs left and right, especially those that are customer facing, because they're tired of dealing with entitled customers, especially during the past 2 years. 

There are a myriad of supply chain issues right now. Getting goods from one place to the next is hard. This is because of the aforementioned combined with people who either retired early during the pandemic, or were laid off and found another career. 

Also, almost a million Americans died due to the pandemic. This will affect open positions no matter how you look at it. Compounded by the resignations and career changes. Places, including pharmacies, are just understaffed. 

People are sick and/or worried about being sick. People want to get COVID tests and they are in high demand so they are hard to find... combined with supply chain issues, it's making it harder. And then when they are sick they want to not go in somewhere, because that's the considerate thing to do, and instead go through the drive-thru. And a LOT of people are sick right now. COVID numbers are really high as the omicron is variant is highly contagious. 

Also, I've heard tales of pharmacies across the country being out of certain things and referring clients to one or a few alternate pharmacies. This one you're having issue with might be the one that others' are sending patients to.

There’s LOTS of parks around too (search “parks near me” and I bet you’re going to find something within a mile or 2), and even if you aren’t swinging on a jungle gym, many have ponds with ducks & geese hanging out, a place to fish…and it can be generally relaxing. Mayyybe a place to meet people too..? (That’s always by chance I think lol - just be careful who you’re swapping numbers with). Lots if kids out of school right now. 

I’m not personally religious, but I think there are some decent churches around town. Maybe you can look into joining a youth group..? Call churches nearby and see if they have a “youth night” or something like that.

"It’s been awhile since I played, but leading up to varsity they have A & B teams for different levels that play other schools. For instance freshman year they had 4 teams.

But coaches made an effort to get the 3rd or 4th stringers in on games that were runaways. 

Hockey was similar. There was a A and B team for junior varsity and one varsity team. 

Most if not all sports followed this type of structure. If they didn’t it was most likely cause they didn’t have enough kids to fill out multiple teams.

"“Doesn’t want to *bus in crime from downtown*” is specific language used by segregationists for decades to justify creating general barriers to access of the suburbs for black and brown people across the US during the redlining era and beyond. 

The fact that “bussing crime in from downtown” doesn’t explicitly mention race, but implies it - *who primarily lives in the inner cities? What is different about those people that automatically makes them all easily characterized as criminals or desperate poor?* - makes the statement into what is commonly known as a “racist dogwhistle”. While you didn’t say anything explicitly racist, *the phrase effectively evokes the fear of other people in the community who ARE racist* to act on that fear as your political/rhetorical ally.

"I've lived here a while and there's a few local gems, but we have an unfortunately high chain to local ratio. That said my favs in town:

Breakfast we like Sunview and Eggsquiste. Frogg is good too but I can't stand their coffee. And everyone will tell you Max's has the best doughnuts.

Scotty P's for burgers, they also have a huge very good Greek salad on the menu. Great place to take a youth sports team after a game as they have a back room that's just the right size. 

Roman Cucina for Italian. So good. Love the ala checca and their creative pastaless dishes. Mio Nonno is also excellent but it's even pricier. On the cheap side Italian Villa is decent.

Tango Empanadas & Bakery. You've probably never had a real empanada, and I hadn't either until visiting.  A truly unique little ""hole in the wall"" type place which Allen is lucky to have. I hope this place flourishes, when I've been in it doesn't seem like there's a ton of foot traffic, but it's so good. I recommend the pulled pork, and literally any of the sweet options I've tried are fantastic.

Dimassi's for ""Mediterranean"" food. While Hedary's is a true local place with a much better atmosphere (are they still sharing a restroom with the Pilates place?), despite being a buffet (which you may or may not wish to do at this time, COVID and all) Dimassi's food quality is consistently very good IMHO and vegetarian friendly.

DAWON for Korean. This is a legit authentic Korean place. Not sure if they are back to full seating (it's a small place) but so good.

Saltlight Station for PHO, though ensure they are open. Their Pho Ga (Chicken) is maybe the best I've had, very generous with the meat (something most Pho places go cheap).

Shiawase for Japanese. Been a while since I've been their but generous with their sushi servings, though for Donburi style food I tend to hit up the food court in Mitsuwa at 75 and Legacy.

J.S. Chen's for Chinese - This is technically in Plano, but being at Legacy and 75 (near Mitsuwa) it's well worth the short drive as it blows away any of the Chinese food in Allen, very authentic and delicious. On the weekends, it's pretty much Dim Sum only (they'll offer you a menu if you ask but the service will be poor in comparison), so keep that in mind.",t2_11fl6d,Dirks_Knee,0,1634137778.0,0,t1_hghp7q4,hghp7q4,True,justlooking2browseee,t3_pnhupe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allen/comments/pnhupe/recommended_local_restaurants_for_new_folks/,Recommended local restaurants for new folks?,/r/Allen/comments/pnhupe/recommended_local_restaurants_for_new_folks/hghp7q4/,2,r/Allen,0,2

Without a full disclosure from the district of the extent of the breach, don't really know exactly what's going on (outside the district lying about having any proof). I'm treating it like any data breach that I've been a part of and keeping a watch on my credit. I already use unique passwords for every site I access, so exposure of any AISD passwords doesn't do me any real harm.

EDIT: I should add...the district should not pay here, the damage is done and any data stolen is gone. This is different vs a typical ransomware attack which locks down data with the threat to delete if a ransom isn't paid (and even then, payment is no guarantee of release of data). All paying does here is give the hackers a bonus as they will likely release/sell what they've stolen anyway.

"Not salty, but it’s just hilarious and idiotic to hear a bunch of suburbanites in a really nice community like Allen, which lacks a true “bad side of the tracks”, speaking about poor.  A significant portion of east Allen is middle class, by definition.  Not “poorer.”  Allen’s definition of poor and poorer shows how sheltered Allen residents really are. 

So whenever I see the west vs east snob debate happening, always perpetrated by west side residents looking to feel bougie, I have to point out the stupidity of it all.   It really is a bunch of people looking to feel special, who don’t know what “poorer” really means.   The audacity to use the word “poorer” about some of the neighborhoods in east Allen.  That’s a special level of suburbanite sheltered.  Imagine saying that to people in the DFW area who truly live in low income neighborhoods that lack the resources of Allen.  They’d die laughing in your face as you clutch your pearls and speak about the poorer side of town in Allen.  

I’m convinced the people who use “poorer” when describing east side have always lived in privileged bedroom communities.  There’s a common theme whenever I’ve heard someone rag on the “east” side.",t2_16nkti,CybReader,0,1620792181.0,0,t1_gxtdrm8,gxtdrm8,False,magmaazul,t3_na76mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allen/comments/na76mt/looking_to_move_to_allen_and_want_to_know_hows/,"Looking to move to Allen, and want to know how’s this area to live in, and why are house cheaper compared to other areas.

"We used to live in a house a little further east of your circle (right under the ""n"" in Presidio Apartments). The houses in that area are a little older and smaller than many of the surrounding neighborhoods, but that's not saying much because those other neighborhoods can be really upscale/pricey.

We liked our neighborhood well enough, no HOA, overall pretty quiet. In the 5-ish years we lived there, we had one drunk driver plow into a neighbor's house a few doors down, and a few reports of stolen packages. But that's about it as far as crime. If you're looking for community, there wasn't much of one in our area; pretty much everyone just kept to themselves.

The schools have pretty good ratings, overall just shy of Plano's if I remember correctly. One of the reasons we moved though was the elementary school my daughter started going to. The principal had this crazy policy where kids are not allowed to talk/socialize. Like at all - even during lunch. My daughter got really depressed and started getting really stressed out by school, so we moved and put her into a new school that she likes much better.

I think the biggest complaint we had is just that the house we were in was right in the middle of a giant subdivision with... nothing much really nearby.  With the exception of a few places in Watters Creek, most of the good restaurants, fast food places, good grocery stores, etc. we liked were either in Plano or McKinney. There's not a lot of interesting stuff to do or interesting events that happen in Allen, so we usually would drive to Plano for family events or nights out.

"I moved here from North Carolina, but I'm originally from New Jersey.

I moved here in January 2019. My wife and I got to the DPS office to do a routine change of license from NC to TX. We arrived at 8:30. We left at 3:00 PM.

Texas DPS is a joke for licenses. The systems here would be overloaded if they were trying to handle licenses for fucking Maine, and yet they're trying to handle them for the second largest state in the union.

Your honest-to-God best bet is to go to one that's in some podunk town 3-4 hours outside DFW, get a hotel room for the night and go there in the morning. Less demand. That's what I would've done then, knowing what I know now.

We have loved Texas since moving here, but it's my one complaint and it's a big one.

Significant raise is questionable. But it will raise the IS portion of the ISD tax rate.  
The AISD tax rate includes two parts. M&O and I&S. M&O is for maintenance and operations that include salaries, utility bills, bus operating expenses, etc. The I&S will be for the Bond/loans for building, renovating facilities, technology, busses, etc.  
The ACE will majorly impact the I&S portion of the budget/tax rate.  


I certainly recommend attending one of the ACE meetings and also review data at AISD - [https://www.allenisd.org/Page/58020](https://www.allenisd.org/Page/58020); As per this documentation, the average increase can be around 0.09%. Again this is an estimate, will not know the exact value until TEA provides clarity on which commercial property will be detached from AISD.

  
The second part is, even after detaching the property, in few years AISD may get to the same state of tax wealthy district and go through the issue again.",t2_6ng466jm,sathyasastry,0,1616698800.0,0,t1_gs7dmof,gs7dmof,False,starlocalmedia,t3_mceksa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Allen/comments/mceksa/allen_isd_chief_financial_officer_said_allen/,Allen ISD chief financial officer said Allen could lose $3.03 billion if attendance tax credit doesn't pass.,/r/Allen/comments/mceksa/allen_isd_chief_financial_officer_said_allen/gs7dmof/,1,r/Allen,0,1

I am still wondering why we aren't doing this too.  The capital expense at the beginning is higher than people might like, but the operational cost and ROI are unreal.

In the case of Allen, especially, this could be heavily beneficial.  But they keep making the biggest spending mistakes possible...like building a STEAM school instead of another high school to alleviate the pressure on the students (like my son who is currently attending Allen high).  It has gotten so bad that in the last year, with everything going on with the lockdown, that upwards of 50% of the students have failing grades (as related by my son who is SQUEEAKING BY).

And at the end of the day, the teachers are taking the brunt of it due to no fault of their own.

Yes, if a caucasian requested a white realtor then it would look racist. Because caucasians control the socio and economic conditions of the country. It's the same reason you can't say the N word publicly Jeff.  Now if we were in Nigeria and a black person ask for  black realtors. Then that black person would be considered racist. 

It's no longer just ok to not be racist Jeff. When your friends make racist jokes. Tell them to stop. When your political leaders make racist or misogynistic comments - vote them out.  See color Jeff, it's important to embrace our difference. Recognize that no one race is a monolith.

"You can call different doctor's offices and ask how much do they charge cash. How far along will you be ? 
Some doctors do not take new  patients after 12 weeks or so. You ll need to call to find out . Ussaly it will cast cost couple of grands not including labs and probably limited ultrasound. For ultrasound you ll need to figure out what machine they have and who does it. Some doctors offices have really bad machines. So you might want to go do it at some other place. 
You could also contact birthing center and figure out deal with midwife.
