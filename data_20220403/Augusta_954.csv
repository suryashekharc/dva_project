I understood they were offering it to everyone because the deal fell thru due to the previous buyers wanting a ton of repairs and they didn’t want a similar situation to happen again. It’s an older home and there were some minor moisture issues in the crawl space. The homeowners were already in the process of having that issue fixed and the other things were handy man type/minor repairs.

I substitute in Richmond County. The standards dropped because students with their parents help are lazy and complain about everything. Elementary nice kids but your kid will fall behind and eventually you will notice they are slow. Middle schools teachers quitting  a lot and behavior is out of control. High school students are a bunch of Karens and mini adults prone to violence. I would say that the schools and  county is not the biggest determinant but more or less you and your child’s ambitions. If you do not have ambitious children then none of the schools will make that happen. Richmond county is predominately black with low achieving students while Columbia County is predominately white with mid to low achievement as well.

We are moving from out of town and didn’t even view the house in person before submitting this offer, so we had a 7 day due diligence period where we could get out of it if we didn’t like the house, neighborhood, etc. Thankfully it was better in person than we expected. We were comfortable with this offer because a deal had previously fallen thru on this house and we had the home inspection from it.

We did not include a contingency on selling our current home. Our realtor mentioned sellers don’t seem to like those in this market (understandably). I felt like this was a very aggressive offer and thankfully it was successful. We could not have done this a few years ago or if we were first time home buyers. We are only able to do this because the market is also bonkers where we currently live and anticipate a significant profit when we sell our current house.

"> in 25 years, the epicenter of this region will be Evans... not Augusta.

I've spent the better part of 40+ years in Augusta, Martinez, Grovetown, Evans, and then back to Augusta; and I could not disagree more.  Augusta, specifically downtown and the surrounding historic areas are the cultural epicenter of the CSRA; to the extent that we even have one.  Evans is simply the logical progression of the caucasian Trail of Tears that started in Martinez when people thought racial homogeny was the key to having good schools back in the 80's.  The swarm of white locusts then started emigrating further and further westward into Evans, Grovetown, and now Harlem as they chase school districts around; leaving nothing but chain restaurants and nail salons in their wake.  In 25 years, Evans will be another dwindling pass-thru community the same way Martinez is now, full of empty strip malls and dilapidated D.R. Horton shitboxes (Starting In The Low $300's!).  And Grovetown will follow, and earn its nickname as South-Augusta West.

"“Unifying the Circle K brand inside our stores and on our fuel islands is improving the customer experience and making our customers' lives just a little bit easier every day.” 

Circle K technically used to just be the convenience store, and depending on which market they were in they sold gas from Valero, Shell, BP, and others. 

https://www.csnews.com/circle-k-rebranding-efforts-near-5000-stores-across-north-america

I used to use the heck out of Fuel Rewards and Kroger Fuel points at Circle K. When they dropped Shell, both went away. Now I use GasBuddy and GetUpside. Savings vary from station to station. Of the two I’ve saved more with GetUpside… my first fill-up saved me 75¢ a gallon. (You can earn bonuses for referrals too.)

They don't discuss coverage _around here_, but Consumer Reports had a nice article _Best Cell Phone Plan Deals for You and Your Family_ in their February 2022 issue of Consumer Reports magazine.


Some extract:

> We get it. Changing cell phone plans sounds like a major headache.
>
> The three big carriers—AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon—bury all sorts of caveats in the small type of their plan descriptions, making it hard to compare offerings, much less figure out what you’re getting and how much it truly costs.
> 
> But based on Consumer Reports’ survey findings, it’s worth the effort to shop around. In 2020 more than half of CR members who switched providers in the previous year reported saving money—with almost one-third pocketing more than $30 per month.
> 
> How? Often by looking beyond the Big Three. Many of the plans recommended on the following pages come from smaller providers that lease excess wireless capacity on cellular networks built and maintained by AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. (There’s no escaping them entirely.)
>
> In our ratings of cell phone plans, based on the input of 61,785 CR members, providers such as Consumer Cellular, Mint, and Ting generally rank near the top for value, customer support, and overall satisfaction.
> 
> AT&T, T-Mobile, and Verizon? They end up in the bottom third. In fact, AT&T is the lowest-scoring provider, receiving our worst rating for value and reception. T-Mobile—which had for years placed higher than its chief rivals—took a dip in 2021, too. After merging with Sprint in 2020, the carrier dropped in almost every category, slipping from above average to average for value, customer support, and data quality. Even carrier-owned alternatives like Verizon’s Visible rate higher.
> 
> Before shopping plans, it helps to know how much cellular data you use each month for things like checking email, getting GPS directions, and streaming music on the go. Without that info, it’s easy to end up paying for more data than you really need.
> 
> […] 
> 
> If there’s one catch to sidestepping the Big Three, it’s this: During peak traffic hours, the major carriers reserve the right to slow data speeds for customers from smaller providers before “throttling” their own patrons to alleviate network congestion.
>
> For most people, that’s not a deal breaker. If you’ve ever been throttled for using up the high-speed data allotment on your “unlimited” plan, you know that it can be annoying, but it’s not the end of the world.",t2_7aj333g7,tcxrt,0,1648092254.0,0,t1_i1vy7q3,i1vy7q3,True,hashtagfred,t3_tlv341,https://www.reddit.com/r/Augusta/comments/tlv341/what_phone_service_is_best_in_and_out_of_augusta/,What phone service is best in and out of Augusta?,/r/Augusta/comments/tlv341/what_phone_service_is_best_in_and_out_of_augusta/i1vy7q3/,2,r/Augusta,0,2

"The judicial system is not systematically racist because it locks minorities up. It IS systematically racist because it DISPROPORTIONATELY locks up people of color when compared to white people. 

Actually, it disproportionately responds to complaints regarding people of color, pulls over, searches, arrests, sentences, and disproportionately imprisons people of color compared to white people, charges them consistently higher bail, and sentences them to significantly longer prison terms for the same crimes in the same jurisdictions. People of color are also far more likely sentenced to the death penalty, and far less likely to have their death penalty commuted to life in prison.

This one is a good brief summary:

They also scheduled a technician to come to the house while on the phone with them but didn't tell me they were doing that. We weren't home the next day when they arrived and that's a $50 fee they charge to have someone come out to your house.

"First, welcome to Augusta. Hope your move goes well and you enjoy the area.

As far as pine pollen, It can be pretty bad if you’re not used to it. Everything outdoors will be covered in yellow pine pollen, not unusual to see yellow clouds when the wind blows. Fortunately the pine pollen is composed of larger particles and is likely not going to cause allergies. However other tree pollen will crank up allergies. The pine pollen can be washed off cars, etc creating yellow rivers with the runoff. Basically let the pine pollen season end then hope for several good rains, wash your car and outdoor furniture and you’ll be good till next year. I suspect if you’re coming in a month you’ll likely catch the tail end of the pollen or just miss it.",t2_kthyb,CincyDawg,0,1646656951.0,0,t1_hzp3vid,hzp3vid,True,Nobody_Special22,t3_t8hsxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Augusta/comments/t8hsxe/is_the_pollen_as_bad_as_they_say/,Is the pollen as bad as they say?,/r/Augusta/comments/t8hsxe/is_the_pollen_as_bad_as_they_say/hzp3vid/,2,r/Augusta,0,2

"A local hiking trail in North Augusta has been closed.

The Savannah River Bluff Heritage Preserve, located at 1129 Old Plantation Road, was closed to the public on Feb. 25, 2022 by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources.

“The property will remain open to SCDNR employees for management purposes only,” SCDNR said in an online statement. “Over the next several days, SCDNR will post closure signs at the property. Those who fail to comply with this closure may be ticketed by SCDNR Law Enforcement.

Willie Simmons, a spokesperson for SCDNR said that it was due to an easement issue.

“We had a chance to resurvey the upper part of the property and when we did, we realized that we did not have an easement for the public to come in,” Simmons said. “If you are looking at Old Plantation Road, the easement that we have is for us to do management, so now we are currently looking and pursuing to see if someone grants us an easement or unless we can buy property on one end of the property or the other.”

The 1.8 mile trail runs through the Savannah Barony neighborhood. The roads leading towards the park are county, however the nearby neighborhood roads are considered private property.

“When they first bought the property, they initially said they were going to get a road access agreement and I guess it just fell through the cracks,” Simmons explained. “... that is why we have to close the property down until we can get a means to get the public in on a legal access.”

SCDNR does not know when the park will reopen.

A lock stands between residents and the Savannah River Bluffs Heritage trail. It was closed recently, and many people in North Augusta wonder what’s going on.  
  
“We all love the park. We all agree. The park is a wonderful thing,” Diane Koehne told NewsChannel 6’s Aiken Bureau Chief Shawn Cabbagestalk. “I think it’s a real shame and a real loss to the North Augusta community,” Pat Kaerko added.  
  
Koehne and Kaerko are two of several people voicing concerns over the Savannah River Bluffs Heritage trail closure. The trail is off a private driveway, but the driveway is not so private after all.

“We sometimes get 50 cars a day on this road and this parking area is there’s an easement here that’s illegal,” Koehne shared. COVID made the parking situation even worse for Koehne and her family. “They would come out here and this parking lot would be totally full and it would overflow down this road and all the way up this road,” she recalled. “As you can see, the road is so narrow that it was hard for the people that live here to even get to their house,” she added. The parking problems are also a safety concern. “They came speeding down our roads. This is like a 20 mile an hour road and they were at 50 miles an hour. Because it’s a one-lane road, there’s so many curves and blind spots that you couldn’t see somebody on the other side. We would actually play a fake-off to see who was gonna move over to allow the other to move on. And we don’t have shoulders on this road either. So it’s very, very dangerous,” she said.  
  
The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources closed the area last week. While the space offered peace of mind, some say other activities were happening there.

“It’s just not good. I mean, we have speeders, we have drug deals going down. We have all kinds of stuff,” Koehne said.  
  
After years of growth, DNR went back to the drawing board to figure out how to add more parking spaces for visitors, but the agency ran into a roadblock. “Because we were looking at maybe doing a larger parking lot, something of that nature. And that’s when we found out that when they first had the property, they did not establish a road access agreement,” SC DNR’s Willie Simmons said.  
  
“This trail is a beautiful resource for people in the area to be able to get out and exercise and get some fresh air.,” Kaerko recalled.  
  
While those who use the area often are waiting for a fix, Koehne has a possible solution. “The parking area needs to be moved. And honestly, if, if that parking area is on DNR property, then it should be over there in the Savannah Barney area.”

Shawn asked DNR if that option would be feasible, “We actually don’t own that property right there that goes through property that the HOA owns. The easement that you see is a power line. So unless we can purchase property or someone grants us an easement. Those are the only two ways to get into the property,” Simmons added  
  
“I think we can come to an amicable resolution. DNR wants to do something. The people on this road wanna do something. We have to maintain this road ourselves over there. The city maintains the road, which makes sense. And it’s a two-lane road. So if everybody is happy, open up that parking spot over there, and open the back park back up,” Koehne added. “The Department of Natural Resources needs to work with the local community here to not only provide additional parking area but also to help compensate the people that live right here for the repairs on the road,” Kaerko shared.  
  
Meanwhile, DNR says the trail will be closed indefinitely until those matters are taken care of.",t2_hqstr,Travyplx,0,1646426200.0,0,t1_hzd2ffy,hzd2ffy,True,Travyplx,t3_t6saad,https://www.reddit.com/r/Augusta/comments/t6saad/savannah_river_bluffs_heritage_preserve_closed_by/,Savannah River Bluffs Heritage Preserve closed by SCDNR due to easement issues,/r/Augusta/comments/t6saad/savannah_river_bluffs_heritage_preserve_closed_by/hzd2ffy/,3,r/Augusta,0,3

"The point is to show support. To let those affected know they are not alone. That what they are going through will be seen by others. Not just the others in their country suffering along with them. 

When people just step back and say nothing, it'll start like WW2. We didn't hear about the atrocities till much later. Wasn't or problem. Then we finally realized it wasn't going to stop. Then the queens army stepped in and we followed suit. Things ended but lasted so much longer than it should have.

We've learned from those mistakes. Also, we don't really on only printed news papers and radio for news. The world is much smaller. Our small irrelevant voices become a chorus they can't ignore when shouting the same thing. 

The people who make the decisions, that have the money, that have the power will notice. And their choices or actions will not be without consequences and they cannot claim ignorance.

"I had my wedding this past October in Augusta and I was so pleased with all my vendors!
- Flowers on Broad for boutonnières, corsages, and fresh bulk florals
- Something Borrowed Blooms for rented silk bouquets (not Augusta specific, I just really loved using them)
- Augusta Special Events Tent and Party Rental for tent, tables, chairs, glassware: Extremely reasonable prices and easy to work with
- Ranco Events for a rented dance floor
- Chick-fil-A for our cocktail hour food: we had a chicken nugget bar that was so popular, there wasn’t a nugget left
- Taqueria El Rey food truck for our reception food: AMAZING, cannot recommend enough. 
- Heart of Soul DJ and Entertainment: Great people, dedicated to giving you your dream dance party and tasteful reception 
- Cara Woodward Hair and Makeup: Airbrush makeup, so professional, will travel to your getting-ready location, focused on making you feel beautiful and working with your timeline (I had 8 bridesmaids, timeline was key) 
- Stayed our wedding night at the Rosemary Inn in North Augusta, it was super luxurious with breakfast in bed in the morning!
