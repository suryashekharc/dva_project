The state ferry boats around central & northern Puget Sound are an underrated way to see marine mammals & birds. You just sit inside the huge boat, out of the weather, sipping good coffee and eating snacks, and looking out the big windows all around you as you travel across the beautiful water. Or you can stand out on the deck for a better view of course, but I'm lazy. Watercraft have to stop engines if whales show up. One time we saw four species of whales & porpoises simultaneously (Dall's porpoises, grey whales, orcas and minkes). All those obnoxious little whale-watching Zodiacs had to stop engines as well, but they were down low and couldn't see much... and definitely didn't have hot cocoa on hand... we sat still for almost an hour as the whales played all around us.",t2_5cj7rexs,5CatsNoWaiting,0,1648968342.0,0,t1_i372aff,i372aff,True,Corbanator26,t3_tusd18,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tusd18/where_are_the_best_places_to_safely_see_wildlife/,Where are the best places to (safely) see wildlife near Oly?,/r/olympia/comments/tusd18/where_are_the_best_places_to_safely_see_wildlife/i372aff/,6,r/olympia,0,6

"\#3  Housing is really bad but that is spreading everywhere in the US with artificial markets and manipulations thanks to outfits like Zillow, huge hedge funds, REITS  and the like flipping houses back and forth and throwing up cheap apartments on valuable land.  Between all of them them, along with foreign investment and local speculators jumping on the bandwagon because borrowing money is virtually free and the same as cash, there is an artificial market with a manipulated demand side creating outrageous pricing.  

It's Tulipmania.   I'd find it hard to make a move anywhere unless I was forced to in this market.  I get multiple contacts from investment outfits and ""Property Aquisition"" companies every week.    The rate of contacts are increasing week to week and it is the same houses around here that go on the market all the time.  They try to find renters to make their payments for them but not many can afford it so it goes back on the market.  They are churning property like crazy to keep the game going. 

No one is selling because where would anyone go?  It's a losing proposition after all is said an done with taxes, fees, etc.  That leaves us with a stalemate and rising prices.  Along with that comes high property taxes pushing everything higher.  

The whole thing is absurd and they try to tell everyone that questions it that it is simple supply and demand.   Then they justify selling or renting at the ""market rate"" that THEY created.  

I wish  I knew how to ""short"" this housing market because it seems like it will eventually implode on itself.

"Excellent schools. 

Housing is an artificially inflated nightmare, like everywhere in this Country. Wage stagnation as well. 

Because people can't afford to rent a flat anywhere, they end up sleeping rough. This has been the way for years. 

You do see signs of these people and encampments. And yes, the garbage, all humans create waste. But that is a direct result of our Governments refusal to do anything to mitigate the situation, such as not supplying garbage services adequately, failing to address rent control, not enforcing affordable housing builds, lack of essential services, etc. We are fighting to remedy this.

Edited to add, no leftist thinks 100 people living on the street is no big deal. Precisely none. It's only leftists fighting to house them. 

Olympia is suffering many of the issues that every American City is facing right now, this is not a ""leftist"" creation, this is not a bi-partisan one-though we are by and large a Blue State (at least the good half of Washington is, lol) but trust me when I say the Ds and Rs are pretty much indistinguishable in the ineptitude, special interest chasing, and general mismanagement department.
In all kindness do yourself a favor and disconnect yourself from the right wing media outlets. There are better more reliable sources of information. In fact, the only true blight other than local politics is that we get occasional visits from Right Wing Nuts Driving Great Big Trucks that are protesting their right to behave like pukes, but we figure once they get their catalytic converters stolen or run out of ammo, they will lose interest. The vast majority of these clowns are not local. 

The plusses, aside from awesome schools, is great people, an awesome music and art culture, this is an inclusive city, drive in any direction and you will find an ocean, a Volcano, a rain forest, a desert; We have great hiking trails, so many lakes and streams, the plusses are too numerous to count.

"1. Our schools are very understaffed at the moment. We do not have enough teachers and the ones we have are very burnt out. Before Covid, the schools were excellent so it will probably level out but not for awhile.

2. We have some great Thai, Vietnamese, and Indian restaurants. For Chinese food you have to go about 40-60 minutes north. We do have a decent but small Asian market.

3. Housing is a nightmare. We do not have enough homes for the folks currently here. The homes here are worth twice what they were before the pandemic. Be prepared to pay thousands over the asking price just to be considered. If renting, be prepared for unpredictable and unreasonable rent hikes. Washington does not have rent control laws. 

4. Our unhoused community is large and visible. I personally do not feel at all threatened by them and they are not the main source of crimes in our area by any means. It is a “problem” because it’s horrible for people to live in such conditions. I am concerned for their welfare, not mine. As I said before, we don’t have enough homes or resources at this time. We have a shortage of doctors and dental care. I am someone with good insurance and am still challenged to get appointments. Anyone with fewer resources will have a harder time.

"1. The public schools are actually pretty great, and Olympia/Lacey also have fairly abundant “cheap” private schools if you spur on public schools for some reason. We do have the same issue that most of the country does though, our teachers are underpaid and class sizes are usually 25+ 

2. You will be welcome with open arms and loads of seasonal celebrations. Being home to joint base lewis McCord we have a high number of Asian immigrants that come over after marrying military members (mostly Korean, some Japanese). I’ve been to multiple Asian heritage festivals and have loved every single one. I think my favorite was a Japanese festival where I got to pound my own mochi.
3. Yes, sadly this is one of our downfalls. I bought my 2000sq ft house 6 years ago for 260k and it’s already been ballooned up to 790k. There are still some places like Shelton that while the city is kind of a dump you can carve out your own little area.
4. I’m a liberal Christian (infer what you will), and the homeless are everywhere and making giant garbage dumps of the freeway and most downtowns, the only “upside” is that they seem to more or less keep to themselves, I’ve never had an interaction with someone that I didn’t specifically want.

Olympia is great if you’re looking at working for the state or government at any level, the food is pretty diverse and pretty good (not top notch Michelin level, but good). The biggest drawback I’ve noticed to this area so far is what’s known as the “Seattle Freeze” which basically means if your not from here and didn’t grow up with an established friend group it’s kinda difficult to socialize.

"To start with: no that's actually not anything I said at all. It's pretty direct. One of the responding officers felt like someone calling him out put him in 'mortal danger' and used it as justification for calling the crisis line on the guy with the apartment (denial thinking: there's no way I'M the homicidal maniac, we need to stop that nut!). A lot of people handle unimaginable stress that way. I suspect that particular cop has a lot to answer for. Any sense of mortal danger the officer felt would presumably be the officer's own guilt from his intentions. From what at least one witness said, he intentionally misinterpreted what the suspect said as justification for the crisis line. If a psychologist finds the cop goes into crisis after being approached with similar lines of questioning, the psych report will almost certainly say something like ""the cop used crazy people thinking as justification for the use of deadly force"".

"The most important thing I want to say about this is I have direct sources telling me that it was the officer who had the crisis and then he went into denial about it and accused the suspect of such instead. From this point the investigation tends to look into whether or not this is the first time the officer has convoluted information this badly, especially when coupled with any sort of mental health concern.

"Fire was dispatched to a fire at the 1300 block of Fern St SW. The fire was intentionally set on the sidewalk outside of an apartment. It does not involve the building at this time. A neighbor attempted to put the fire out however the guy that started it pepper sprayed the neighbor. Fire is staging for officers to arrive.

The suspect retreated into his apartment after pepper spraying one of the officers. The officer is ok and does not need medical. The fire has been extinguished.

The male is still inside his apartment. Officers are still on scene and will most likely arrest the suspect once they are able to get him out of his apartment. They have advised him over the phone that he is under arrest.

Update: 7:08pm - 2 officers have been stabbed and the suspect has been shot. Critical care is being preformed.

The suspect has been airlifted.

"I practiced law in Oly for 15 years. A couple of years ago, a close relative came out as trans and wanted to change their name. They grew up outside Philly but their family have a vacation home in Washington. 

Family fully supported transition and name change. Got wind that Judge in PA had a reputation for shaming and dead naming trans youth at name change hearings. They asked me to figure out if they qualified as WA residents to name change in WA. 

Consulted with Lavender Legal Services and did some digging into online trans name change support groups. Confirmed that Pennsylvania is (in the words of a trans attorney) “the worst” when it comes to trans name changes. 

Also discovered that WA, and especially Thurston County, has been a haven for trans name changing for decades. I seriously found posts going back to the 90s about it. People in Oly have been welcoming people from across the country to come to Oly, live with them, establish residency, change their name, and then go home (if that’s what they want.)

I asked a judge I trusted what the process was like. He told me that his very first day on the job as a judge, the more senior judge walked him through their process for handling trans name changes. She told him rule number one was don’t use their dead name. 

My own relative’s experience in another county in WA was similar and life affirming. 

Whenever I have represented clients with pronouns that aren’t cis-typical, I’ve filed a document called “Notice of preferred pronouns” and always had the judges go along with it.

I love it when Oly is a cool place for our trans siblings. It’s so fucking cool to see people and get to know people comfortable with being who they are. 

That said, Oly is a lightning rod for right wing assholes. They like to swarm on Oly and stir up shit. That would scare the shit outta me if I were trans.

"Hmph. Don't be defaming your south-county neighbors. Tumwater's Black Hills High School had the first Gay-Straight Alliance in Thurston County (they now call it the Gender-Sexuality Alliance bc these kids today are smart) and was Pizza Klatch's first site. It's a very interesting & safe place. OP would probably not even be the only trans kid in the classroom.

OP, Tumwater is the little town just south of Olympia. It got paved over when they built the interstate and doesn't look like much, but looks can be deceiving. The mix of redneck + hippie + state worker + punk + Mormon populations gets weird sometimes. BHHS used to be the only school in the state with both a rifle club and a GSA, but then they got rid of the rifle club due to lack of interest. (Some of those queer youth had very good aim btw.)

Lacey (to the north of Oly) is also fine, especially for youth. The schools are good, and the folks at Olympic Cards and Comics will make darned sure you're okay.

When my daughter (a BHHS alum) brought her two tiny out-of-state trans friends to visit, they remarked on how many businesses in the Olympia/Tumwater/Lacey area have the ""Safe Place"" stickers in their windows - if anybody should hassle you, you can duck in there and they'll make sure you're safe. We actually hadn't noticed how many there were until the friends mentioned it. Not just the lefty coffee shops, but also the toy store and the downtown hardware store and at least one tire store.

Unfortunately everywhere is going to have assholes/bigots but I would say this area is more welcoming of LGBTQ people than lots of the US. I myself am pansexual and have not gotten much flack when out in public with my girlfriend at the time and i have lots of friends here who are openly trans who enjoy living here. Oly has a pretty strong positive LGBTQ presence downtown like pride flags up every day of the year in stores. bars like McCoy's and the crypt are openly known for being very LGBTQ friendly and while that's out of your age range it does go to show that there are places where trans people can be and feel safe. The Evergreen State College is a big influence on the culture of the area and its super progressive/leftist so it helps attract and inspire acceptance among oly people to be actively anti-bigoted. Lots of house shows here are very LGBTQ/POC friendly because they tend to be pretty hard left/progressive spaces. I've ran into more tankies at shows than neo-nazis cuz most of the time any open neo-nazi knows they are going to get the shit kicked out of them (personally seen it happen a couple times at McCoy's).,t2_it6sw10h,PNWmantismistress,0,1648681315.0,0,t1_i2s0cwr,i2s0cwr,True,QveenJules,t3_tsl9ll,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tsl9ll/how_accepting_is_olympiatumwater_for_trans_ppl/,How accepting is Olympia/Tumwater for trans ppl?,/r/olympia/comments/tsl9ll/how_accepting_is_olympiatumwater_for_trans_ppl/i2s0cwr/,18,r/olympia,0,18

There is no total break down of the interest rates added in over 24 months if you do not pay within 6 months. When I Asked so at the end of the 24 month contract the dog cost $5000 and she said yes. I asked why the interest rate was at a ridiculous amount and what does that do to the $5000 price tag.

"Because I don't care about a petty ideological distraction that amounts to us regressing toward civil rights era and cold war levels of mistrust, racism, and political violence. 

I care about ending the corrupt oligarchy that exploits workers of all races, and I want to undo the outdated financial systems that have oppressed three generations. I care about continuing the work disenfranchised millennials like myself began 10 years ago.

Here's a brief timeline:

&nbsp;

September 2011, Occupy Wall Street begins.

May 2012, the OWS May Day March on Wall Street happens with 100,000 participants.

July 2013, we start to see headlines about ""Black Lives Matter"" and the ""Alt-Right"".

2016, those have evolved into local chapters of BLM, Antifa, Proud Boys, Patriot Front, etc. We're so fractionalized that we elect Donald Trump and divide this country to a degree not seen since the civil rights movement.

Now it's 2022, and the only words in anyone's mouth are identity politics. We have shootings in out street with our fellow Americans over buzzwords and propaganda, over our own overblown fears and misdirected anger.

Liberals of all stripes have no trouble supporting multinational corporations that use child slavery abroad and pay poverty wages here, as long as the corporate twitter account tweets a Rainbow Flag, BLM fist, or ""Thoughts and Prayers"" when appropriate.

Conservatives are of course equally misguided and propagandized. Brainwashed into worshiping capitalism as a god, and ignoring their own principles as long as it ""owns the libs"".

&nbsp;

People talk about racism, equality, and generational wealth. But then they ignore the fact that a black and white millennial are closer in wealth to each other, than either of those people are to the boomers of their own race. 

You've fallen for a theater piece, just like those you despise on the opposite side of this stage play. Our oppressors have convinced you that your enemy is the guy standing next to you wearing a red hat, not the fat banker standing on both of your throats.

Joe Biden is just an actor is this stage play, same as Trump, Obama, the Clintons, the Bushes, Reagan, and likely those preceding still. None of them have cared about your race, gender, or sexual identity. They care about your votes and how cheaply they can acquire your labor.

"The police and county prosecutor basically put out a red carpet for these fools.  They allowed two shootings with absolutely no prosecutions.  Two shootings where the perp was arrested and let go without any consequences.  The cop who was photographed buddying up to local militiamen was given officer of the year award.

We had a strong antifascist movement in this town up until last year. Olympia worked with Portland and Seattle to keep this city clean of these pieces of shit. The liberals in this town continued to prosecute, blame and attack local activists who were protecting this town.  Our mayor loves to label housing activists and BLM activists as terrorists much to the amusement of local right-wing shitlords like David Ross.  Finally Olympia had seen that antifascist activists have thrown up their hands and unsurprisingly, this town has become a playground fro the right openly marching downtown.  Openly hunting people in our streets.  People like Candice Mercer, openly calling for the lynching of a Hispanic activist with not so much as a ripple of anger.

I would say you get what you deserve, but unfortunately these yuppies won't be the ones who are harmed.  It will be our homeless, our queer, and our black and brown neighbors who are harmed.

Meanwhile, I know multiple amazing activists of color who have had to move from this town because it is no longer safe.

"Heyo! Congrats, having a garden can be so rewarding!

The majority of soils over here on the west side tend to be acidic, and will benefit from an annual application of some lime to bring them into ideal veg pH range. But the growing season is taking off already, so I would save that for the fall and just jump in! What does (or doesn't) do well can also give you indicators. Agree with other who suggested a soil test, but I'd do that at the end of the season at this point.

Do add: Compost. Beneficial regardless of soil type. Where & how you source it can depend upon your beliefs/ethics/ budget. Do you need certified organic? By the bag or in bulk? Etc. Just do be sure that it's been properly composted (lookin' at you, ""free horse manure"") so you're not planting your new garden with weeds & grass seeds.

Also: Nitrogen. The majority of veggies are nitrogen hogs. I highly recommend cover-cropping with a legume or two in the mix over the winter, but for this season I'd get some fish emulsion. Don't spray it on things right before you're hoping to eat them (because ewwww) but it's an effective quick fix for fertilizing.

I'm an organic farmer so my suggestions are guided by those principles, which also favor the long view & overall soil & ecosystem health. Sorry, can't help it.

Most of all: Just go for it! The best way to learn is by doing. Some things will work, some won't, and they're all learning opportunities :) Hoping for the best for you, and happy eating!",t2_5pew7ym1,Saloriel,0,1648519700.0,0,t1_i2ijfu6,i2ijfu6,True,The_Wizeguy,t3_tqc3lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tqc3lb/created_new_garden_space_what_to_add_to_the_soil/,Created new Garden space what to add to the soil?,/r/olympia/comments/tqc3lb/created_new_garden_space_what_to_add_to_the_soil/i2ijfu6/,3,r/olympia,0,3

I also recommend pulling dryer from the wall and disconnecting the hose so you can deal with/replace that separately depending on condition. Also allows you to clean the duct from both sides if it's particularly long.

Finally if you've owned the dryer for awhile it's also advisable to read it's service manual(or wing it if your half handy) on how to get inside it and go at it's inards with a vacuum and brush to keep it from being a fire hazard and running at peak efficiency.

Edit: if your paranoid and I know I am and you have the space to store it when not in use assembled you could glue/threadlock the joints.

"I haven't been obsessive enough birds while I've lived in Olympia to know where the good spots are, but I saw a pileated woodpecker at Priest Point Park like ten years ago, and it's probably a good place to go for a general excursion. I've seen kingfishers there, which is something.

I've seen various species of duck in Capitol Lake, although in my mind the whole place overlaps almost perfectly with Green Lake in Seattle, so if I told you want I'd seen in Capitol Lake I might be thinking of the other lake.

If someone told me I absolutely had to go watch birds, right now, within five minutes of South Olympia, I'd go to Watershed Park. I have no idea what's there but there have to be a ton of birds in there, and I could swear that remember hearing winter wrens in there, although once again I might be hallucinating about something in Seattle.

"Window mounted units are the best.  The ""portable"" units are not very efficient at all (the ones that are free-standing, with an exhaust duct that vents out your window).  Something a lot of people dont realize is that with those portable, free-standing units, the farther they are from the window the less efficient they are.  The exhaust ducts are not insulated and dump heat back into the room; more so the longer they're stretched.  If you cant get a window mounted unit and a free-standing portable is your only option, the best way to use them is to put as close to the window as possible, with the duct running as straight as possible.  Use a makeshift platform if need be to get the exhaust port lined up straight with the window.  Each curve in the duct will slow the hot air exhaust and lead to more heat dumped back into your room and higher cooling bills.  If you have to have the unit a bit away from the window, you can try to insulate the exhaust duct the best you can to limit the heat dumped back inside.",t2_96nnm,JoeFarmer,0,1648335123.0,0,t1_i28xrvx,i28xrvx,True,coffeeginrepeat,t3_tp4wmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympia/comments/tp4wmz/help_me_not_melt_this_summer/,Help me not melt this summer!,/r/olympia/comments/tp4wmz/help_me_not_melt_this_summer/i28xrvx/,10,r/olympia,0,10

"So you can season your beans, by and large, from the get go instead of adding additional steps later. Soaking in salty water will make sure you can season your beans as you got and not worry about mushy skins. The saltwater causes ion exchange with Mg in the skins so they stay solid during cooking.




Soak 2.5 cups dry beans (1 lb bag) in either cold, salty water overnight

Or cover beans with salty boiling water and let stand 1 hour

Rinse and let beans drip dry

For stove top:

Heat a heavy pot over med high heat

Add 3 tblsp or so of oil of choice (I like ev olive oil)
Sauté until tender with some non-iodized salt and pepper: 

[Chopped]
1 med onion
1 hatch pepper
1 poblano pepper
1 jalapeño

Add some crushed garlic (I go big here, but preference)

Add 1 or 2 tblsp toasted ground cumin and 1-2 tblsp oregano and a bay leaf
Cook until fragrant
Toss in the beans, season with salt and pepper to taste, and coat them with the oil and flavor, cook a minute or two.

Cover with 6 cups water or stock (kombu dashi or mushroom stock for extra credit)

Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, partly cover, and simmer for 1.5 to 1.75 hr depending on bean type. Stir and fawn over the smells occasionally, start tasting your gravy around the 45 min mark to adjust seasoning. Adjust liquid as needed to prevent scorching. 

You can start with less water/broth but you really have to keep a close eye.

Pressure cooking, you can do the same recipe just the boiling bit obviously.
