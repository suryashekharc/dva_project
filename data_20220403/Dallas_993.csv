"It‚Äôs kind of astounding to me that in probably the last 10-20 years of lgbt acceptance, how much history relating to these groups got sanitized.

Essentially, younger groups that don‚Äôt understand the history but enjoy the acceptance wonder why anyone would care about them.   It was always kind of a given when the US went back into a more witch hunt and less live and let live  mode they‚Äôd have to deal with it again.  

It‚Äôs not any more complex than, there was a time that LGBT was treated just as brutally and so they were found often in these groups‚Äô spaces for protection and numbers.  Many of the more intimidating parts of the population were in them.  Their security was tied together to some extent.  Did the cops want to try raiding them?  A lot less than a gay dance club you‚Äôd find.

This was always somewhat expected though.  The reason many straight kinky couples were found in these spaces was the same reason.  When the US goes through one of its ‚Äúpedos are everywhere‚Äù spells, the line blurs and it becomes costly and dangerous to run these spaces even if your circle doesn‚Äôt have pedos in it.  Not saying these groups don‚Äôt have them either, just that Pedos from an enforcement standpoint are everywhere because it‚Äôs not a political affiliation, it‚Äôs an individual‚Äôs behavior.

"This comment really pissed me off. You obviously have no clue what it takes to live today. My son, who is 23, makes $15.22/hr, and cannot afford an apartment anywhere in a 100+ mile radius.

He pays us rent, and banks the rest. If he had to live on his own, he literally would not make enough to pay all the bills and buy food, let alone save for any kind of future.

"At the same time, we have cost of living increasing exponentially where the minimum wage is not increasing with it.

Many restaurants are already increasing pricing to maximize profits without raising wages for employees, increasing the disparity between money earned vs money paid to staff.

There are McDonalds on the area that are advertising $12/hr for assistant manager positions, yet I can name a number of other places off the top of my head that are offering more + salary + competitive benefits for the same position. If they can't compete against other companies that ARE offering such costs, then it's their own fault that they aren't successfully hiring people.

Back on McDonald's, how is it fair that the CEO *doubled* his salary from $10 to $20 *million*, but they're ""struggling"" to meet the needs of the workers at the bottom rung.

It's super clear that they care more about the profits than the people who are basically responsible for earning them said profits.

"The strawman argument is that you're talking about an environment that does not exist.  We live in a capitalist society.  No one morally has to like it, but that does not mean it doesn't exist.

Businesses are not in business to make friends.

Businesses are not in business to give people jobs.

Businesses are not in business to be socially responsible.

Businesses are not in business to make customers happy.

If making friends makes more profit, then businesses do it.

If giving people jobs makes more profit, then businesses hire them.

If beings socially responsible makes more profit, the business will be more socially responsible.

If better customer satisfaction makes more profit, the business will make more customers happy.

"You can also sign up for emails from Dallas Garden School. She is local, in Dallas proper, and also does classes and whatnot if that‚Äôs of interest. 

North Haven Gardens also has a great newsletter and they have demos/seminars that are often free as well. 

Also I forgot that I also do sweet potatoes, I get my slips from North Haven. 
I have blueberries also, i got those originally from North Haven as well. 
And my olive tree, which isn‚Äôt old enough to set olives yet or anything though. 
Same with my Lime and Lemon trees, still ‚Äúbabies‚Äù and we probably won‚Äôt get fruits on them for another year or so. 

Also look up square foot gardening and companion planting. Both good ways to start off for newer gardeners! 

I also suggest doing a few things by start/transplant vs all seeds. That way things go a little faster, and you get a confidence boost and early satisfaction vs the waiting game with all seeds.

"There are several groups on Facebook that are really helpful, if you are on there. 
ASK North Texas Vegetable Gardeners is a good one. Especially since you are a new gardener and will likely have questions. 

Personally, I second dutchy with ‚Äúadvice is just advice‚Ä¶sometimes people who give it, don‚Äôt follow it‚Ä¶‚Äù lol. 

Also a lot of it depends on what varieties you pick, how you‚Äôre growing (in ground or raised bed or container, etc), how you‚Äôre watering (old school can, hose, irrigation system, etc), your soil, how you‚Äôre feeding/adding nutrients, and so on. 

I grow food crops, very few floral/decorative items and grow all year. There are no ‚Äúno-go‚Äù months for me, but I also am not great at following advice and real good at ‚ÄúI do what I want‚Äù hahah. 

That said, I grow in raised beds and containers because I am a renter and I also don‚Äôt have a ton of space. 
What I have going right now:
- tomatoes and marigolds are in. I do have these drop over  greenhouse things I got at Aldi last year that I‚Äôm still putting on overnight and for any cold snaps we may still get. 

-cold weather crops- I have lettuces, kale, spinaches, a couple brocolli and cauliflower still going. I don‚Äôt expect them to go much longer as it gets hot, but I also let them all bolt and shoot up flowers because the bees love that and I then collect the seeds. 

I‚Äôve got basil, chives, chard, arugula, cilantro, parsley going right now too. They like cool but not cold and will probably do well in their shady spot until we got the real heat HEAT. 

I have pepper starts, that will probably come out of the greenhouse and into the beds pretty soon. 
I am also going to get beans, melons, cucumbers and possibly squashes in soon as well. 

I have had two miserable years dealing with squash vine borers and I can‚Äôt decide to throw in the towel or try one more round with squashes or not. 

Corn was a fail last year, but my kids want to try again, so corn is a maybe. 
Amaranth also a maybe. We did it one year, and it did well, but not sure if I‚Äôll do it again. 

Okra will go in later when it‚Äôs a lot warmer and okra does really well here. You have to plant a lot of them though, in order to get a decent harvest. It‚Äôs not like tomatoes where a few plants‚Äôll do. 

Malabar spinach does well in the heat. So do collards and mustard greens. 

I‚Äôm probably forgetting a few things, but you probably get the picture!

"I'll tell you this about tomatoes. When I moved here, everyone would say ""don't plant them until April or they might freeze!"" Then those same people would be harvesting in early June while mine were just setting fruit. Then I'd find out they put their plants in the ground in early March and just covered them up if there was a freeze. They do save some of their plants to put in the ground in April just in case but they didn't let me in on that tidbit. 

The moral of the story is advice is just advice and sometimes the people who give you the advice don't follow that advice. Experiment and have fun with it. 

Also, my biggest piece of advice is to garden in the winter as much as you can. Even during the horrible storm last year, my cabbage, kale and a bunch of other things survived.

"Oh God.... You're one of those poor souls who comes on Reddit to argue for kicks. Ok. Well then, enlighten me professor. In your ragged diatribe response you feature no counter argument with any relevant facts other than anecdotal evidence you probably got from out of the window of your car on I-30.



>was making fun at the fact that you pointed out 4 or 5 separate points of the city which are only a few blocks long to make your point about how walkable the 4th largest metropolitan area in the US is. I hope that's clear now. 

Well....Ok....And......That's kind of a square peg round whole observation. Of course those places aren't connected. Dallas wasn't developed as a city that way. Off to a bad start already.


>I only mentioned shootings because two of the few neighborhoods you mentioned are riddled with crime. No one wants to walk in deep ellum or downtown when you can get mugged and shot for doing so. You failed miserably here. 

Do you have any relevant data that Deep Ellum or downtown are any more dangerous than anywhere else in the metroplex? Or are you again just pooping in your hand and calling it evidence? I would imagine there are shootings anywhere people drink, and carouse, and gather. We are after all in America. 

Also how do you know where anybody wants to walk in the Metroplex? How do you know no one wants to walk in Deep Ellum or Downtown? Have you been to either place? Like ever? You sound like a person who hangs out in the suburbs and has a lot of opinions about what's going on in the city, when you haven't actually been anywhere.



>You have to be kidding if you're trying to exemplify an efficient public transport system with DART. This is the dead giveaway that you're arguing for the sake of arguing, and possibly trolling. I won't even address this ridiculous suggestion. 

Do you use DART? Because I do. And I know how the trains run. This is so ignorant as to be laughable.


>Thanks for showing how you've never been to either of these places. That's absolutely not true. The fact that you continue to make DART an example just nullifies any reasonable attempt at addressing the issue. 

Been to Miami. Been to San Diego. I've been on the people mover, and the trolley and Light Rail in San Diego. How? How is this not true? Maybe have counter points to support your argument?



>OK, and? Meeting up at an airport is the absolute least it should do. No reason to praise them for doing so. It's still mediocre and inefficient. Look at the many park and ride lots that are empty across DFW as an example of this. Stop trying to defend DFW transport. It makes you look ridiculous.

One of the important litmus tests of the usefulness and efficacy of a metro transport system is moving people along places in a city, and then after that giving them the ability to connect to other means of travel. From the Dart station closest to me I can take the Red Line to West End station, connect to the Orange line and be at the Terminal at DFW. If the wonderful efficiency of that simple fact is lost on you, you shouldn't really be having this argument. If your evidence is looking at empty park and ride lots you really should just leave your opinions to your buddies in whatever close minded suburb you live in.


>Oh boy.... You wrote paragraphs upon paragraphs and yet nothing meaningful came out of your mouth. On the contrary. There is such a thing as objectivity, which you know none of. You're ignorant when it comes to these issues, and yelling and screaming won't change that. Good day.

Once again... In an argument you argue your points in a clear and didactical way, with relevant points to bring to the conversation. So far the best thing you have is you've looked at park and ride lots and noticed there weren't cars there. That's fantastic detective work.

">You‚Äôre a suburbanite, so you‚Äôre Eric‚Äôs real constituency

Not sure what this is supposed to mean, or what it has to do with anything in my post. Everyone in DFW benefits from a healthy and vibrant Dallas, given it's the city that anchors the metro area. That's especially true in my case given I live in the same county as Dallas and in a suburb almost entirely surrounded (to the North, South and East) by Dallas.

>The city isn‚Äôt rated AAA with any of the three ratings agencies and has been repeatedly downgraded due to pension problem

I did confuse Dallas proper with Dallas County with the bond rating. I'm big enough to admit my mistake there.

That said, Dallas' bond rating \*IS\* currently AA. Other than San Francisco and Boston, I dare you to find any city anchoring a top 15 metro that has a higher bond rating higher than Dallas, or pension obligations in good order. And frankly, if Dallas has a credit rating that's only worse than the two cities in the country notorious for displacing/alienating residents who are poor or POC, tht's not a bad thing.

Point being, the doom & gloom expressed by you and others is blown way out of proportion, because the fact that Dallas isn't perfect doesn't mean other major cities of similar size are any better (in fact, many of them are in worse shape).

>The city is very much experiencing wealth flight out to the suburbs and is now losing population.

Do you have a source to back this claim up?

Because if you're referencing the 2021 census estimates, those won't be available for cities until July 2021. What the 2020 census shows that Dallas grew by 9% the past decade, occupancy rates are high and birth rates exceed death rates.

Furthermore, the number of workers in Dallas earning $100K has \*INCREASED\* from 12.8% of the working age population in 2017 to 15% of the working age population in 2020. Not to mention, Dallas \*PROPER\* (not just the Metroplex) has one of the highest concentration of millionaires and billionaires of any major city in the country.

This is all putting aside, BTW, the reports that black/hispanic people were heavily undercounted in the recent census \*AND\* the effects the COVID-19 lockdown had on the physical count.",t2_1q6do3l,waffle-fil-a,0,1648912492.0,0,t1_i346joc,i346joc,False,notstylishyet,t3_tu9jvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tu9jvt/thoughts_on_mayor_eric_johnson/,Thoughts on Mayor Eric Johnson?,/r/Dallas/comments/tu9jvt/thoughts_on_mayor_eric_johnson/i346joc/,-4,r/Dallas,0,-4

"Not really.

The biggest difference to me is that Dallas, specifically downtown, is still primarily business driven and commuter based. Other cities, Detroit and Cleveland in particular from your example, have been doing tons of revitalization into their downtown areas that make it ""cool"" to live and work there. Dallas, while a lot of money IS going into downtown, still struggles with residential amenities.

"Is LSHT actually 128 miles? It seems like major sections of the trail are always out of commission. 

It doesn‚Äôt even show up in AllTrails when you filter for trails 100+ miles. It claims 92.4mi. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a great trail. I‚Äôm in the minority among my hiking buddies, but it‚Äôs my favorite trail.

"Dallas‚Äô air quality is not nearly as bad as other large cities actually‚Äî some of the worst cities for ozone and air particle pollution are ‚Äúcool‚Äù cities like LA, San Diego and Denver. Even lovely, quaint Fort Collins ties Dallas for ozone. Check out the American Lung Association‚Äôs [pollution rankings by city](https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities). 

As a person who has lived over 45 years in Dallas, it is baffling to me that anyone could ever find Dallas ‚Äúboring‚Äù or ‚Äúgeneric.‚Äù It has a very distinct worldwide reputation (thanks to the TV show and Kennedy) for being a city of guns and glamor, whether or not that is accurate. Literally every person I have met in other parts of the world while traveling has heard of Dallas, and has a clear picture of its personality (albeit a fictionalized version). Our reputation is that we are Big D: Bigger than life. Very distinct personality, not generic at all.  Ask a foreigner to describe Newark or Omaha. 

Now, when you actually live here, you realize that this city is a cultural Mecca. Hands down better food and more diversity than most cities. My street alone in what some people would call the ‚Äúboring suburbs‚Äù has no fewer than 8 different countries represented in the space of a quarter mile strip. It is literally the opposite of anyone‚Äôs vision of a pasty-white ‚Äúsuburb.‚Äù (I also lived in Houston for several years and will take anyone to task who finds that city boring. Houston is amazing.)

And while I hate Dallas traffic, I now spend very little time in it: I commute by bike, and take the DART train whenever I can, or a combo of the two to reach faraway places. We are unique and lucky in that regard: this is rapidly becoming a very bikeable city, with a very active cycling community and a lot of excellent interconnected multi use trails that can let you get nearly anywhere on a bike, including all the outlying towns* of Richardson, Plano, Frisco, Allen, McKinney, Denton, Lewisville, etc. (People often refer to these as ‚Äúthe suburbs‚Äù but these are actually full fledged functioning cities in their own rights which just happen to be near Dallas). If you spend your life commuting by car on a freeway anywhere in the US, you will never experience the unique things that make an area interesting. 

And don‚Äôt discount strip malls. Those are often the places with more affordable rent where you will find the coolest, quirkiest family-owned places. Visit the strip mall on the southwest corner of Belt Line and Central in Richardson. There is a fantastic family-owned pizza place called industrial Pizza, a Peruvian restaurant just opening that I haven‚Äôt tried yet, and an independent guitar shop, among other things. The ‚Äústrip mall‚Äù near the water tower on the northwest corner has a row of Austin-caliber-cool places including a coffee shop, noodle shop, GAP pizza, and Lockwood Distillery. Hidden gems. 

I love visiting Austin, love its quirky vibe, love the hills, and regularly bring my bike there, especially since the traffic and parking is so horrible that biking is significantly more efficient. But its cycling infrastructure is not nearly as good as Dallas‚Äôs. 

My suggestion to people who think a place is boring or soulless is to get on a bike and see it from a different angle. Freeways are the things that are soulless.",t2_tscpk,stewartdesign1,0,1648907251.0,0,t1_i33vnpt,i33vnpt,False,cook511,t3_ttsrov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/ttsrov/the_most_generic_american_cities_according_to/,"The most generic American cities, according to Redditors [OC] -- Do you agree?",/r/Dallas/comments/ttsrov/the_most_generic_american_cities_according_to/i33vnpt/,1,r/Dallas,0,1

The city's not experiencing wealth flight, it hasn't experienced a spike in crime unlike most major cities post-COVID, it continues to maintain a balanced budget with a ~~AAA~~ AA financial bond rating (tough feat for most major cities), Love Field is one of the best-run municipal airports in the country, plus basic services such as park maintenance & trash pickup remain efficient.

That said, the leadership structure that Dallas has makes it very difficult for the Mayor to accomplish much of a transformative nature. Everything has to go through the City Council, where each of those individuals also have their own agenda (for example, the Councilwoman in Plano-adjacent District 12 who gets off on being a contrarian against any type of progress on behalf of her NIMBY constituents).

Furthermore, many of the problems people are complaining about (I.E. lack of investment in South Dallas) pre-date Eric Johnson's administration and is not entirely the fault of city government.

The main thing I would criticize Eric Johnson over is his failure to address the dumpster fire that is the building permit process. With a good competent manager, all of the problems in this area could easily be fixed without having to involve City Council. People complain about how much more expensive the city's getting and how much higher their property taxes are getting, but when you make it so hard for developers to build new housing or open new businesses that would contribute new tax revenue, that's bound to happen.",t2_1q6do3l,waffle-fil-a,0,1648902738.0,0,t1_i33nprb,i33nprb,True,notstylishyet,t3_tu9jvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tu9jvt/thoughts_on_mayor_eric_johnson/,Thoughts on Mayor Eric Johnson?,/r/Dallas/comments/tu9jvt/thoughts_on_mayor_eric_johnson/i33nprb/,-7,r/Dallas,0,-7

"Bishop Arts, Lakewood Deep Ellum and Downtown are all connected to rail and bus lines. East Dallas because it was an older established neighborhood had problems with NIMBY complaints otherwise it would have had rail. But it has constant bus lines. And yes, most of the neighborhoods I have mentioned are indeed walkable. 

As to the issue of shootings. I don't really understand what that has to do with the issue or not of whether the city is generic, although crime and murder by gun is I guess generic enough to be an epidemic in American cities everywhere. 

Dart trains run about every 15 minutes and some lines like the Red and Blue routes go even quicker depending on the time of day and how many trains they have operating. 

Is it perfect? No American transit system is perfect. Woefully, politics and the kind of cynical pessimism you seem to be engaging in here derail many attempts to secure the funding that would make US transit systems better than they are. But it's better than MARTA in Atlanta. It's better than Houston's Rail system. It's better than the system in Phoenix. The Miami people mover is cool but it doesn't go to as many places. The only one that is even approaching DART in terms of efficiency is San Diego's system, but it doesn't go as many places. Los Angeles's system is incredibly impressive with the sheer size, but it doesn't operate as efficiently as Dallas's. Denver's is a joke of inefficiency. 

And as to the rail for the whole mega region do your home work and check on what's happening in Fort Worth with Tex-Rail and the TRE before you decide to LYAO. It goes less places than Dallas, but the two separate lines from both cities meet up at DFW airport. Many other systems have problems with going to airports in their cities. Los Angeles for one still does not have a rail service that will take you inside LAX. Dallas and Fort Worth now operate 3 separate lines between them that will take you directly to the terminals, and one that is adjacent and runs shuttles to the terminals.

"See I don‚Äôt feel this way about the city of Dallas, I feel this way about DFW and it‚Äôs suburbs.  People in suburbs and outside Dallas sometimes actively choose to stay away from more ethnic groups, lower standard public schools, crime, poorer people, higher property taxes, etc.  I enjoy Dallas to an extent because I have Mark Cuban and George Bush 5 minutes from me one way, and prostitutes and strip clubs 5 minutes the other way.  That may be segregation, but I pay more in property and taxes to experience all of it and I love it all.  Suburbia chooses to ignore all of that, pretend they‚Äôre in a place that is safe and familiar, and still live cheaper than in a big generic city and in a larger (cookie-cutter) home.  Dallas isn‚Äôt anything special in a lot of ways, but it‚Äôs not terrible like people make it out to be.

"**[Caravan of Dreams](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravan_of_Dreams)** 
 
 >Caravan of Dreams was a performing arts center in the central business district of Fort Worth, Texas during the 1980s and 1990s. The venue was best known locally as a live music nightclub, though this was only one part of a larger facility. The center also included a multitrack recording studio, a 212-seat theater, two dance studios, and a rooftop garden. The center was at 312 Houston Street, and prefigured the redevelopment of Sundance Square into a dining and entertainment district.

"Deep Ellum was a marginalized sector for decades. While it was almost as famous as Harlem in NYC in the 1920s and 1930s, during and after WWII, it was largely ignored and neglected for decades. The only reason the streets were in decent repair was because they were arteries to and from downtown. It was a maze of abandoned storefronts. There were some small businesses there because it was a depressed area and the rents were cheap. After the success of the West End Marketplace in the 1980s, the developers began to move into and redevelop Deep Ellum.

">I knew you were going to respond with money being the driving factor as to why private school kids are more successful. I knew that because I've had this conversation a thousand times and everyone who doesn't know about the private school system believes this. Money has nothing to do with it, because: #1 you cannot buy grades, and #2 plenty of low income kids in public schools still go onto college and become very successful in their lives and careers so that busts your theory and the article you linked. That article is hand-picked and whoever wrote it has no idea as to what they're talking about and I'm very serious about that. 40% of the kids at my daughter's private school are normal, average income levels (no more than kids at public schools) and even low income (the school and very generous donations help with financial aid for those families). Those kids remain far higher than state and national averages of public schools. Family income levels have absolutely nothing to do with it. 
  
Seriously, take a breath...   
  
If, as you said, you've had this conversation hundreds of times already and you still don't understand what people are telling you, then I doubt I'll be the one to convince you, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt for now. There are a few things that you seem to be missing here:  
1. Anecdotes are not the same thing as data. The fact that you can point to a few low income students who are given the opportunity to have a private school education and go on to live successful lives is entirely irrelevant to the question of whether or not public or private schools lead to better outcomes on average, and **more importantly why that may or may not be the case**.  
2. No one with an understanding of the subject claims that money itself guarantees you a better education. What money provides is the likelihood of a more stable home life where kids are less distracted by questions of food security, lack of adequate supervision due to parents being forced to work longer hours in order to survive, and the chaos and occasional danger that can come with living in certain very disadvantaged neighborhoods.  
3. Selection bias: if you simply take the raw numbers of all of the children who attended private schools, and all of the people who attended public schools, and you compare their outcomes, then private schools will absolutely perform better, but it's not simply for the reasons that you seem to believe. You mentioned, as though it was a substantial number, that only 40% of the students at your private school are what would be considered ""average"", implying that the majority belong to high income families. That means that according to your numbers roughly 60% of the students at your school belong to families that are likely to be able to afford private tutors, or who may be able to afford to leave their kids with a stay-at-home parent, or paid guardian during after school hours. These are kids that never wonder where their next meal is coming from, and never have to wonder if their family will be able to afford rent to keep a roof over their head. These kids are able to focus as much as they choose to on their school work with fewer distractions. It's these students who are likely to have much better outcomes than students who do not have those advantages, regardless of which school they attend. It's simply that most of these highly advantaged students choose to attend private schools, then perform better because of their advantages, and therefore improve the average outcomes of private schools as a whole. If you account for and correct for these errors in the data, the advantages of private schools tend to disappear in the results. If you separate people into two groups, and force nearly all of the people with disadvantages into one of those two groups, then *of course* that group would, on average have of worse outcomes, regardless of the teachers or the subject matter. It's statistically inevitable.  
  
>I will tell you this, unless you went to a private school, or you currently have kids in private school, then you have no clue as to why or how private school works and any article you find online will not give you true information. It's like when I tell people that private school teachers in Texas make far less than public school teachers, *every single person* I've told this too said ""No they don't they make way more money"" and then they look it up and their jaw drops. I could go on and on but I can tell you do not have a clue at all. And you still circumvented the fact that private schools steer clear from absurd ""agendas"" that you are promoting. Teaching forced politically backed morals in schools? Ugh... give me a break. Absolute nonsense.  
  
The most absurd thing here is the claim that private schools steer clear from agendas, whereas public schools do not. Personally, *I did* spend a few years in a highly accredited private school in Texas in my high school years, and then chose to go back to public school when my family moved. For the most part, I have few complaints about my private school experience, only that it cost my family a lot more money than it was worth. The only difference between it and my public school education were was the relative affluence of the other students there. The material I learned in my private school was not any more strenuous or challenging than what I learned in public school. The major difference in fact was that in private school, especially in classes related to subjects like biology, instead of actually spending significant time covering the subject matter of topics like evolution, our school had a policy of ""teaching the controversy"". Basically this meant that instead of learning about these foundational biological concepts from people who understand and respect the subject matter, we were taught nonsense ideas such as that ""evolutionists"" believed that ""people evolved from monkeys"". Then of course those same teachers would turn around and attack that obvious and idiotic straw man argument in order to convince kids that evolution was unsupported by evidence, and only believed by fools. I literally spent hours in a biology class watching videos made by propagandists like Kent Hovind and Ray Comfort, and yet you sit here now and tell me that private schools are free from agendas.   Insanity...  
  
>Private schools do not cripple them with uncomfortable ideas. Because what you think is an uncomfortable idea is actually political propaganda absurdity. Right wing or left wing political BS is nowhere to be found at my daughter's school and I could not be more at ease with this, and her and all of her classmates are in a far better position as a class and as a school with their educational position.  
  
Again, I can't be sure if you simply misunderstand what I've said, or are being deliberately obtuse here. ""Uncomfortable ideas"" includes anything controversial. These ideas can be true, false, or entirely matters of opinion. It only matters that they require you to think. What is important is learning to confront the structure of the arguments for and against these ideas, in order to learn how to recognize good *and* bad arguments. You have to hear a lie in order to learn to recognize one. The purpose is to teach kids to be skeptical, not to shelter them from ideas that you, as their parent, simply disagree with.",t2_49d38,kahrahtay,0,1648856288.0,0,t1_i31q9zi,i31q9zi,False,yosemitebison,t3_tnmu4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/tnmu4z/north_texas_superintendents_say_uproar_over/,North Texas superintendents say uproar over critical race theory in schools is a Republican ‚Äúmanufactured crisis‚Äù,/r/Dallas/comments/tnmu4z/north_texas_superintendents_say_uproar_over/i31q9zi/,1,r/Dallas,0,1

"I had my pool redone last year. I'm in Richardson near Garland and also have a large ""sport"" pool (21k gallons). Satellite images show it's the biggest in the neighborhood heh. 

I ended up going with FG Pool Repair. Quite happy with the results. Because it was the largest home expense I've encountered - I called 10 companies. 7 showed up to give quotes. Spent hours reading reviews.

Ended up redoing the tile, mastic, and coping. Pretty much all the companies quoted around the same for the resurfacing (+/- $500) but FG came in much less for the coping/tile work so I went with them. If you are looking at doing coping/tile - they came in at about half the cost and the work they did was amazing - I'm picky and found nothing to complain about.  

I went the pebble route (Stonescapes). FG did a great job. Despite being a somewhat darker color (Aqua Blue) - the color is pretty consistent across the pool. The color was a bit off at first in some areas but as it cured it became nearly even. This seems to be an indicator that their crew has a lot of experience doing it. 

My only complaint would be the lack of instructions for how to balance the chemicals after... and they didn't add enough CH as was needed per the manufacturer. Minor complaint though since I handle the chemical balance myself and was able to find the instructions online very easily.

"Lived in DFW for almost seven years, but only in Dallas proper for a year, so take this with a grain of salt; I can completely understand why Dallas is on here, but I think that it's definitely undermining parts of the city.

&#x200B;

What makes Dallas generic:

* It's completely unwalkable and choked by urban sprawl, probably moreso than any other metro area in the US.
* Geographically located nowhere special.
* DFW Airport is a huge hub, so a lot of people only pass through the city and never see it.
* The city's most recognizable institutions are either overlooked (UT Dallas, U Dallas, DCCCS) or infamous (SMU). The same with the sports teams (Stars and Rangers are pretty subdued within their sports, the Cowboys and Mavs are easy antagonists there).
* Dallas' image, nationally, is secondary to Texas' image.
* Dallas is an incredibly segregated city, and as a result, there's a veneer put up, in terms of image. The culture of the Park Cities and North Dallas, while wildly different than that of South Dallas, is the one that is put forward and obscures the other cultures.

&#x200B;

What makes Dallas unique:

* Dallas is a huge city and is a cultural hub! That's indisputable.
* Despite the segregation, there are still those smaller pockets of culture that locals tend to know about (K-Town in NW Dallas, the Hispanic areas around Jefferson Ave., etc.).
* The city has a unique history w/in the American canon and the Texan canon, and has a very different feel than other cities. 
* White Rock Lake, Bishop Arts, Deep Ellum, and Oak Lawn are all awesome neighborhoods with a lot of flavor.
* Along w/Fort Worth, DFW is the largest set of twin cities in the US, and you can easily get two different experiences within the same area.",t2_10cmli,ionlymemewell,0,1648846872.0,0,t1_i315ydv,i315ydv,True,cook511,t3_ttsrov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/ttsrov/the_most_generic_american_cities_according_to/,"The most generic American cities, according to Redditors [OC] -- Do you agree?",/r/Dallas/comments/ttsrov/the_most_generic_american_cities_according_to/i315ydv/,3,r/Dallas,0,3
