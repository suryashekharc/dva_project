Guess what happened, we fought tooth and nail to keep it, and even though the Alamo fell, we Texans pulled through sand kicked their asses out.

"Hancock fence did mine and I get comments on how well-built it is. 8 ft, board on board with steel posts. Was expensive but worth it.

Heard Museum. Great trails here too. Sometimes live music at the outdoor amphitheater. Sometimes themed attractions to visit.

I’ll second the suggestions for Tupps and Hutchins, though. Tupps makes some damn good beer and Hutchins just might be some of the best bbq you’ll have in your whole life.

"Check out the downtown square area. A few places to get drinks and some good restaurants. For breakfast/lunch check out Spoons or Snug on the Square (might be closed for construction still). For dinner check out Cadillac Pizza or The Yard (especially if the weather is nice). For desert hit The Pantry for pie or for boozy ice cream at Cocktail Creamery. 

Also in the downtown area is Rick's Chophouse if you want a fancy meal. Expensive but very good. 

Off the square I second the recommendation for Tupps. Good beers and the Food Truck there is excellent. Also check out Stix Icehouse - huge patio and another good destination if the weather is nice. 

Another neat area is on the west side of town called Adriatica: [https://www.adriaticavillage.com](https://www.adriaticavillage.com) \- neat place to walk around and take pictures and some good restaurants there as well.

Tupps Brewery is a fun time - great brewery with lots of options, usually good live music, events most nights, and a food truck run by Rye.

When I was still in high school and lived with my parents I had to park on the street.

It always traumatized me Bc he, a big man, would yell and scream at me at the time I was 16-17. I wonder if he does it to the new people that live there

But I would look on your Facebook page and see if your neighborhood has a group! I’m sure others have complained as well.

Their customer service, community outreach and support, employee satisfaction, HEB brand foods, and selection are just all above what other stores in the area offer.

"Seldom do any mass transit systems make any substantial income, that’s why they’re funded through sales tax, it’s simply a public service. We don’t judge schools on their potential for income do we? The same goes for any non-tolled highway. 

The old rail line you’re referring to is actually a reason why DART could so easily expand further north. Those tracks are owned by Allen and building a second track and catenary to support electric (or no catenary if DART ever converts red line into DMU’s) would be relatively simple. There would be no purchase of land making it a sound investment for Allen. The issue is that Allen already has their sales tax set at the state limit. For Allen to get DART service, they would have to reallocate 1/8th of their sales tax revenue. 

It’s a shame. Historic Downtown McKinney could heavily benefit from some sort of public transit, however, it would take an act of state legislation to allow DART to expand. 

One last note: DART is not profitable at all but metro systems, especially a park and ride like DART expands revenue exponentially with more service. Texas is one of the most challenging areas in the country to build efficient mass transit, and it will take a large investment if we ever want some of these highways to relieve some traffic.",t2_qzh5a,Fancy_o_lucas,0,1644621442.0,0,t1_hwkm7by,hwkm7by,False,ProudLion12,t3_spacm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/McKinney/comments/spacm0/city_of_mckinney_breaks_ground_on_11_million/,City of McKinney breaks ground on $11 million indoor tennis complex,/r/McKinney/comments/spacm0/city_of_mckinney_breaks_ground_on_11_million/hwkm7by/,1,r/McKinney,0,1

Is it a warehouse job or is it sales? One is logistics and labor, the other is sales. Those are two different jobs with wildly different skills sets and wildly different pay structures. 

Who would you be working for? What companies warehouse is it? What kinds of products are we supposed to be handling? What kinds of conditions will the work take place in? Is it haz mat? Are certifications required? Is it contract basis or is it a w-2 position? 

What is the compensation? What's the hourly? Do you bonus out, and if so by what metrics? Are there benefits, and if so what?

The best bet would be to contact me through e-mail (contact@planomill.com) or one of the other methods listed on [my website](http://www.planomill.com/contact.html) since I don't log into this account very often.

"When I lived in Los Angeles, there were virtually no cops using speed guns to catch speeders. They only looked for obviously dangerous driving behaviors. But it looks like cops in Texas have far more speeding traps set up. It's like they are just trying to fine their citizens to fund their departments. For 20 years driving in LA, I've only received one traffic ticket. In Texas, I already got one ticket in 3 years and my wife got another one as well. I got mine when I was on dedicated lane entering the SRT. I was speeding up to match the SRT speed limit. You HAVE to speed up from 50 mph to 70 mph so you can safely merge. But the cop didn't take that. 50mph limit is 50mph. Until you are completely in the tollway, you need to keep driving at 50mph. I'm now going to keep at 50mph and merge with cars driving at 70mph.

"Not really many curves or less traveled. But, I use to enjoy the drive between the DFW area and Austin at night when the traffic was low and I could open it up.  I use to have all kinds of stupidly fast supercars past me like I was standing still when I myself might not have been strictly obeying speed limit too, so as long as you aren't going that stupidly fast.   I use to leave around 6:30PM when rush hour had died down, stop for Kolaches in West Texas (get enough for breakfast), spend the night bar hopping in Austin or to catch a specific band playing, and then drive back mid-day on Saturday.  Word of advice, stick to the speed limit through Waco for your own safety even if there isn't that much traffic, it is a decently sized town and will have idiot drivers just like we have in the DFW.

"I am in the same problem situation as the OP here. As it is the real estate market prices have skyrocketed in the last couple years and it is super hard to find any decent 4-bedroom home in and around 500K range within the vicinity of Frisco ISD. Added to that is the burden of the newer community homes being boxed-into a small lot say about 5000-6000 SqFt. I do find some older ranch type homes are typically built in much larger lots - like 9000 to 10000 square feet and doesn’t feel as much boxed. But they often have only 3 bedrooms and no media or game room. Always wondered if it would be worthwhile to purchase one of these and pull up permits to add additional rooms.

"The responses here are really disappointing.  Of course you're new here - that's the whole point right?!?! Also, I disagree that what you're looking for doesn't exist.

What does not exist in McKinney is a *new or recently built* home with significant space in the backyard or between homes.  All developments in McKinney in the last approximately 20 years feature essentially the issue that you are talking about.  There are homes built before that time (or new builds built in older neighborhoods) that have larger lots.

So, inside the city limits of McKinney, I would look at the following neighborhoods: the Historic District and surrounding downtown neighborhoods; Eldorado, particularly those parts closer to 75, Eldorado Pkwy and Country Club Drive.  Also take a look at Tucker Hill (though I doubt they have bigger lots) and Vintage Place (this is a brand new neighborhood under construction now so I'm not sure what those are going to look like but I think their lots are bigger.)  Look at the streets surrounding Rockhill Road and Randy Lee Lane as well (I think the latter neighborhood is called Northpark. Personally I think it's run down and not nice but the lots are bigger.)  Also there is a neighborhood south of 380 and East of Lake Forest that has 2 acre lots but there aren't many homes in there and they are expensive and they are under constant threat from developers.

Outside McKinney Fairview and Lucas both have larger lot neighborhoods.  Lucas has development standard minimums of 1.5 acres I think.  Fairview has several new developments with smaller lots but they have old neighborhoods with big lots too, look at Camino Real Drive in Fairview.

Hopefully this is a bit more helpful to you.  BTW, I live in the historic district and I have almost a half acre lot and this is my second home in the HD with a similarly sized lot (and both were well under 500K though you couldn't buy either for that now).",t2_fwinn,thewombbroom,0,1642449073.0,0,t1_ht2ucb2,ht2ucb2,True,Sarjobran,t3_s68ufq,https://www.reddit.com/r/McKinney/comments/s68ufq/why_are_all_the_backyards_so_tiny/,Why are all the backyards so tiny?,/r/McKinney/comments/s68ufq/why_are_all_the_backyards_so_tiny/ht2ucb2/,8,r/McKinney,0,8

"Eh haha. I’ve lived out in mckinney for about a year now & I haven’t explored too much due to the pandemic. Yes I’m paranoid so I just stay home, but downtown mckinney has some neat spots that I’ve been to.

The apartments I’m in now are nice and new (I can message you the name if you’re interested), but they fill up quickly. It opened in 2020. Neighbors are quiet, nice, and we have no issues here as of now. A year ago you could’ve found a 2 bedroom for that price (here), but everything has gone up tremendously in the past year. Im currently paying 1195 for a 1 bedroom in mckinney and I’m looking at $1400 if I resign this year, so be mindful of that while looking. 

Prosper has some new apartments opening up that are pretty cheap. Saw some 1 bedrooms for $1100 (740 sq foot) and 2 bedrooms (did not get the sq footage on that) for $1450. not sure if they’re so cheap because they’re new and trying to fill them up, but wouldn’t hurt to check there too.

"That my friend is called probation fees AKA supervision fees. It's the reason so many people end up getting in trouble on probation for very minor things. Granted I was using and that's my problem and choice that I made for myself. But probation in general is designed as a money Grinder. You do one thing and they tack on something that costs you money to do. Typically around $50 a pop I had an anger management class that cost me 50 bucks to get done I had a theft prevention class that was 50 bucks to get done. I've also got to take an MRT class which is $30 for the book and 12 weeks worth of classes one per week at $25 for class. Oh and that $150 of supervision fees that's not including my drug tests, which cost $25 a piece. I have to call in every morning to a hotline that tells me whether or not I'm supposed to test that day so I could get tested 30 times in 30 days if they really wanted to, granted they don't but there have been months where I wasn't breaking any rules or dirty and they were testing me around eight times a month, you do the math on that that's $200 a month in drugs teats alone. And that still doesn't include the fines that you pay to the actual courts. I've been on probation for 14 months total only 12 of which is for my assault charge but I have a rough estimate that I've spent more than $5,000 on probation fees and fines together not including the classes and the warrant costs. Oh that's something I forgot to mention you get charged $52 every time a warrant is filed. 

I've had literal sheriffs and people that work at the probation office tell me how utterly crooked the probation system for Collin county is. I know that I screwed up and that's neither here nor there in this particular post comment that I'm making but I know a lot of people that have been on probation across the country because I stayed in touch with a lot of my friends who moved and got in trouble after moving away and I haven't been in trouble in 18 years so I would kind of try to talk to him through doing the right thing, and I've never heard of anything as just unbalanced as their probation system is here.",t2_17gi3g,Cryyptus,0,1639799534.0,0,t1_hp0cf45,hp0cf45,False,Cryyptus,t3_rihws8,https://www.reddit.com/r/McKinney/comments/rihws8/can_anyone_give_me_misdemeanor_probation_legal/,Can anyone give me misdemeanor probation / legal advice,/r/McKinney/comments/rihws8/can_anyone_give_me_misdemeanor_probation_legal/hp0cf45/,2,r/McKinney,0,2

I was on probation in Collin county for 8 years and never had a violation. Do what they ask you to do. Show up to meetings early. Crush any part of the given probation no matter what it is. 50 hours of community service? Ask where they give you double hours then do it in the first month. Classes? Enroll and suck it up like an adult. You did the crime. You do the time. Probation officers have to deal with people who don’t do what they ask.

"I really appreciate that and yeah that kind of mess happens everywhere on probation not just Collin county but Collin county is the worst I've ever seen in the country. I mean probation is a big scheme to get money out of people for the city or the county depending on where you're at and I've always known that. In fact that's why I got my act together when I was a teenager and had screwed up big time. I knocked it out and dealt with it and moved forward but like I said in the post I back slid and screwed up and here I am now just have to roll with the punches and deal with whatever comes my way. 
And let me say this from the bottom of my heart I don't know you and I haven no need to have met someone to be able to say that I am sorry that you or your boyfriend ever had to go through probation and being railroaded by a system that's designed to make people fail. 

Really you can be trying to get your life on track and they intentionally make it hard so that you fail backslide and keep making them money. It's ridiculous. And it's not just me somebody that's 36 doing dumb shit. I don't know imagine summer 18 year old just out of high school fighting because they're 18 and dumb... Boom assault charge probation being locked up around others that leads to a more criminal mindset even if it's for a short period of time, instantaneously exposed to the likelihood of failure.

Good chance he sentences you to the whole year.   


You do get good behavior time for that. You can have your public defender ask for only jail time and no probation and honestly I will always take the jail time over the probation. Probation in collin county is a trap. They want to make it impossible and get you to violate. If you can sit the time do it.   


You won't be transferred out of collin county. For anything under a year.   


Only time that's doesn't have good behavior is state jail felonies.
