"This is going to deeply affect the urban schools as well. I often wonder if people realize that private schools are allowed to pick and choose the students that they accept, even when they receive pubLic funds. A voucher isn’t going to buy you a place in a private schools. If you have a child who struggles with academics, behavior, or just a student who doesn’t fit their demographic they are not going to accept them. This is nothing but a way to bleed the public schools and eventually privatize them. If your child isn’t exactly what private schools are looking for you will not have a choice. You will still be sending your kids to public schools,

"Fun fact about the ""Convoy"" song.  While it is banjo heavy and  composer Chip Davis won the Country Music Writer of the Year in 1976, it's was recorded with a full orchestra and has a french horn heavy chorus.

Davis was a classically trained composer at Bill Fries' (C.W. McCall was a character name created from country and western and McCall's Magazine which Fries liked the sound of).

You might know Davis from his Mannheim Steamroller group and their multiplatinum Christmas albums.

Convoy comes from that CW McCall character created for this ads for a bread company:

"The Iowa GOP, specifically Kim Reynolds, strongly support the use of eminent domain to seize rural property to give to a private corporation to build a CO2 pipeline across the state. They want to stick cameras in classrooms. They want to censor school library books and imprison teachers. Reynolds banned local school boards from mandating masks in response to airborne contagious diseases. And the state services that are very helpful for rural Iowans? Don't expect them to remain fully funded with the new tax system the Iowa GOP put in place to overwhelmingly benefit the very wealthy. The Iowa GOP's private school voucher system, btw, directly takes money from rural public schools and gives it to private charter schools, which are rare in rural areas. Your drinking water is more likely to come from a well in rural Iowa, which is likely severely polluted by farm runoff, like fertilizers and pesticides. The Iowa GOP's Medicaid privatization is negatively impacting the number of healthcare providers that can operate statewide, and that means fewer providers are able to serve rural areas.

"Price gouging is the logical conclusion of the unregulated markets you favor. Insulin costs in America are roughly 10 times what other countries pay, yet those countries have no problem procuring insulin. This isn't passing costs of production onto consumers, these companies are taking advantage of their volume of production, the patent system, and inelastic demand to kill generic competition. 3 companies control 95% of insulin production in the world and 100% of the american market. They mirror each others cost increases. The exact same insulin (same manufacturer, same production process, same drug) that's $100 in america is $7 in australia. Goverment intervention is the only realistic way of solving this. Couldn't find any information on the medicare inprovement fund, if you do please link me.

Look under ""Concealment.""
You should consider seeking a license, as any bladed weapon >5 inch is considered a dangerous weapon.

The test for concealment under Iowa law is whether the weapon is discernible by ordinary observation per the case of State v. Newsom,  563 N.W.2d 618 (1997), where the Iowa Supreme Court stated:

We discern the policy underlying the prohibition against concealed weapons to be based on the protection of those persons who may come into contact with a weapon bearer. If a weapon is not concealed, one may take notice of the weapon and its owner and govern oneself accordingly. No such opportunity for cautious behavior or self-preservation exists for one encountering a bearer of a concealed weapon.

The intent of the person carrying the weapon is not a factor. Rather concealment is based on the perspective of people who come into contact, or proximity with him. In a state where the intent of the weapon bearer is an issue, one might argue that pocket clip carry, as opposed to placing a knife completely within a pocket indicates a lack of concealment intent. This is not the case in Iowa.
The State v. Newsom Court further instructed that a weapon:

is not concealed simply because it is not discernible from a single vantage point if it is clearly discernible from other positions. It may be concealed, however, where it is discernible from only one particular vantage point.

Concealment or what is “discernible by ordinary observation is ultimately a fact question to be determined by a jury. Prior to deliberation a jury in a trial where the charge is the possession of a concealed dangerous weapon in violation of § 724.4. Carrying weapons, the jury would be instructed, as to that precise issue, using the following pattern instruction:",t2_vqo4k1,NyayN,0,1648931996.0,0,t1_i35d0lo,i35d0lo,True,DarKknight786848,t3_tt71i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tt71i0/legal_swordcane/,Legal sword-cane,/r/Iowa/comments/tt71i0/legal_swordcane/i35d0lo/,1,r/Iowa,0,1

"Iowa is not a massive food desert, and not so regarding grocery stores -- but it is at least concerning restaurants -- and especially when you have a particular cuisine in mind. There are small towns where the grocery store is \~20 minutes, but the grocery stores have a large selection. That's not unreasonable. That same town is the same 20 minutes from \*ANY\* Pizza restaurant (and iirc, only has a bar-restaurant in town). They \*do\* have a gas station, though. If that gas station happened to be a Casey's, your choice is 1) Casey's, 2) homemade/frozen from previously purchased ingredients, or 3) 40 minute round trip. If that's the choice, Casey's wins. If you lived in that town with a grocery store, I can think of \~12 local places with better pizza, and another  dozen chains with better pizza, and at least one national chain with WORSE pizza -- and another gas station with pizza just as good, but not advertised as much.

Again, personally, the best thing about Casey's Pizza is that it's easy to get.",t2_ha7s7,iowanaquarist,0,1648909954.0,0,t1_i3413qx,i3413qx,False,thatblackman,t3_tte343,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tte343/what_is_the_best_cuisine_in_iowa_what_are_some/,What is the best cuisine in Iowa?

"Registered Libertarian here, and I feel that I need to point out something.  And it's important to read the legislation which these people are casting their votes before posting such a sensationalist headline.  
  
We all want affordable insulin.  It's **how** we make that happen, which is the point of contention.  I disagree that these people voted against affordable insulin, but rather they voted against the government's forceful hand at capping it, the effects of which may result in manufacturers simply exiting the market, leaving no insulin for anyone or supplies so low that there is not enough product to supply the market.  That's certainly not what anyone wants.   
  
As I read the bill, and the Social Security Act which it is amending through this bill, I see that it is amending a certain provision of the Medicare Improvement Fund from $5 MILLION to $9 BILLION.  I don't have all day to research exactly what this is, but that, right there, is glaringly suspicious.

"> because they want poor people to die

Hyperbole, yes. I'd say that they actually love the poor and the ""poorly educated"" as a reliable vote bank.

> It also doesn’t address the major issue of the US pharmaceutical companies price gouging the overall price

If that's the crux of the problem, do you think regulation is necessary here? Or is that Big Government oversight and overreach that stifles Big Businesses yearning to breathe free?

> namely that it wouldn’t include the coverage of the 28 million people in the US who don’t have health insurance.

OK. How many people does it cover now that weren't covered before? 7.8 million people in this country use insulin to manage their diabetes ([source](https://factcheck.afp.com/trumps-insulin-order-frozen-not-scrapped-biden)). What fraction of them belong to the 28 million people who don't have health insurance?

So we don't do anything to help a few more people because trying anything at all in a broken hyper partisan political system is ""simply band-aids and do nothing to actually solve the problem.""

"The bill now faces an uphill battle as it heads to the Senate, where Senate Republicans, much like their House counterparts, compare the measure to “government price fixing”.

“Today, it’s the government fixing the price on insulin,” said Rep Cathy McMorris Rodgers. “What’s next? Gas? Food? History tells us that price fixing doesn’t work.”

Other critics of the legislation point out that the Affordable Insulin Act has some loopholes, namely that it wouldn’t include the coverage of the 28 million people in the US who don’t have health insurance.

It also doesn’t address the major issue of the US pharmaceutical companies price gouging the overall price of the lifesaving drug, and instead shifts that burden onto a person’s insurers and employers.

"[Citation needed].

But because you won't be bothered to Google ""trump insulin"":

> During the 2020 presidential campaign, Trump touted his order on insulin in ways that made it seem as if it would have a broad impact on prices, but the rule was narrowly targeted, according to Rachel Sachs, associate professor at the Washington University in St Louis School of Law.
>
> “The rule as it was finalized **would never have applied to all or even most Americans**,” she said by phone.
> 
> If implemented, it will require that Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) -- which serve about **one in 11 Americans**, including homeless and vulnerable populations -- offer the discounted price they receive when they purchase insulin and injectable epinephrine (EpiPens) through a federal program called 340B.
>
> Sachs said these centers already provide some free care and discount drugs for people living at less than 200 percent of the federal poverty level, meaning $34,840 for a family of two. The new rule would expand those discounts to FQHC patients with incomes up to 350 percent of poverty -- $60,970 for a family of two.  
>
> “Those are very important patients that we should be caring for,” Sachs said, but the exact number of additional patients who would have seen discounts is far from all diabetics who are facing large insulin bills.

"Ya, we are pretty close.  Now, years ago I did some looking into it, so hopefully my memory serves me correctly.  But it is my understanding that money that comes into districts from the state and federal sources are ""per student.""  So if my child is homeschooled, the school doesn't get that money anyway.  I believe this is why our district liked the fact that we partially homeschool- they still get the money but don't have our kid to fill a seat for half the day.  Our other daughter has gone to the 100% online Iowa school - and that school got the money for her.  The money goes to the school instructing the child.  These public schools are quasi-municipal **corporations** that stand as their own entities.  They should be judged against objectives and compete for money.  Competition drives quality.  If a public school can't meet the needs of the student, that money should go somewhere that can.  Right now, there is no way a majority of people can afford to take their child from the public school and place them anywhere else, even a nearby local school because the logistics just don't work out for their family.  So ya, we can debate whether the money should go to those private schools, and i could agree with you, as long as whatever approach we take, it increases school choice.

"Dear Republicans 

These are your representatives. Hope you are proud. Says a lot about you as a human being if you believe a medicine should exist that people can't afford and then die because of that.

JFC wake the fuck up to the callousness of your party!

": Billions of tax dollars go to private entities
Does not mean it is right

: Public schools are private entities.
How so, please explain

I am not a fan of public school. Nothing against (most) teachers, just a broken system (imo). And only got worse when the the federal government under republican power implemented ' no child left behind'.

I would not advocate for 'families with little wealth', but instead children with limited opportunities. Because, many times this is do to cycle of bad choices of a child's parents. Maybe a choice by a parent who was a child when they became a parent. Maybe a choice to run the family farm and financially it is a struggle. Maybe a single parent because a choice to mate with a loser. Many reasons. And I suspect a bad choice by 'families with little wealth' or more difficult to overcome than for a family with financial means.

I believe the choice should be more along the lines of 'choice to go to any public school'', and it needs to be focused towards the younger child. If a child is getting a poor education in the elementary years, going to a private highschool (imo) won't do much. If kids were leaving 'bad' public schools, maybe a portion of monies follow the student to the new district. And possibly the good ran public schools would get better and the poorly run public schools will cease to exist. It is a complex issue, with rural and urban, poor and rich, transportation, extracurricular activities, the loud voices of the extreme and the quiet voices of the majority.

I could go on and on and on, but I'll end by saying I agree with almost everything you say. I think a say another comment you made related to sports and you are spot on. I just disagree that money should go to private schools. I also believe (most) public school districts have enough monies, but need to learn to be financially responsible (along with every other government entity).

2 tbsp apple cider vinegar

"I'm glad they are increasing they payment to redemption centers, but grocery stores and others who want to profit from selling these single-use items should be required to take them back, as the Bottle Bill originally intended.

It needs to be strengthened and expanded to include water, sports drinks, and other single-use beverage containers. The deposit needs to be increased to at least ten cents, and closer to a quarter to have kept up with the original nickel 40 years ago. 

People talk about recycle bins at home. **That wasn't the purpose of the Bottle Bill.** The purpose was to ensure that these containers, which are often consumed away from home--in cars, at baseball fields and events, along trails, etc.--are kept and disposed of properly. Go pick up trash along any busy roadway, look in the trash after any softball tournament. Those containers all need to be recycled, and strengthening the Bottle Bill is the most effective way to do that. 

In fact, we should be pushing for [a national bottle bill](https://resource-recycling.com/recycling/2022/02/08/national-bottle-bill-likely-to-land-in-congress-soon/) and other extended producer responsibility legislation to make sure that those who create and profit from all this waste are the ones who are responsible for cleaning it up.",t2_dpy3a,ataraxia77,0,1648725385.0,0,t1_i2u0zek,i2u0zek,True,Mediocre-Attempt-378,t3_tson5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Iowa/comments/tson5o/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_bottle_bill/,What are your thoughts on the bottle bill,/r/Iowa/comments/tson5o/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_bottle_bill/i2u0zek/,14,r/Iowa,0,14
