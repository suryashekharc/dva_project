"JSC sucks. They claimed it was only a name change. My parents had an account with them for many many years. Not only did they change their name .... but everything went down south.

My mom has had nothing but a horrible experience since they changed the name- The changed back in Oct or so. My dad died then. At that time BBVA changed to PNC and JSC to Wellby.   I cannot tell you how many problems my mom has had. In addition, because of their mistake on her checks she had 12 checks returned. She requested addition checks like and order. Instead of ordering checks on the account that already has checks- they ordered checks on an account that has never had checks, She said that she should have caught. Maybe- but they should have ordered from the checking account she told them to.

Thankfully, she has not had to pay fees.- she let them know up front - SHe will not pay fees on their mistakes,

The latest problem- waiting for checks that were written one ago just now are clearing the her checking account.  The businesses said they cleared 3 weeks ago- but they were outstanding at the bank not listed on the register online.

I have told her to leave.  She mistakenly thinks that JSC service and quality will reappear. 

I personally go to Amoco. I like the way they operate. I had JSC yrs ago. I no longer have account- I am thankful now. The other CU I use are Dow, Cypress Fairbanks.  In the past I had University Federal- sorry I did not like it there. Dow is supposed to be good., Personally , I like Amoco more.

"I think you might have better luck with your query if you post it to the Clear Lake Reddit group rather than posting it as a reply to my complaint. 

I’ve been a homeowner at the same location for about 20 years now, and I’m not particularly friendly with any of my neighbors. There’s no animosity, just nothing that has called for us to do more than say a few words in passing or chat briefly about Christmas decorations. 

I know a lot of people in the area through work, and while many people know and do things with their neighbors, others have an experience similar to mine. I think it comes down to personalities, so it’s just luck of the draw.

"I have been looking all over the CL area in hopes that when I am able to move I will be able to relocate there.  Years ago I lived in an area within the CyFair ISD and found that the neighbors kept to themselves and were not too friendly. Later when I moved to Spring Valley the neighbors were friendlier than the CyFair area but, still not what I was looking for. While most of the neighbors had children of different ages I did not at the time have any. I also lived in a rented home. I was not sure why the neighbors turned a blind eye to us. Perhaps, they looked at us .... oh... another set of renters. Since I had not come from a family that rented homes and had always lived around friendly neighbors I was not sure what the deal was.  So, with that said in the neighborhoods of Bay Oaks, Bay Forest, NorthFork , and those that have Brook as part of their names -do the neighbors have anything to get involved in besides sharing the blades of grass between their homes?

  Currently, I am living in a small town and I happen to live in one of those homes built before 1900.  The area CL is quite appealing. It is close to the water when one wants to go, it is close enough to Houston and culture events when one wants to participate. There are several churches in the area, decent grocery stores (although, you all could use a Central Market or a larger health food store), and close to medical facilities. The home prices are pretty much intact with the home prices across Texas. 

  Any neighborhood I would move into must have neighbors that speak to one another and a cherry on top would be one that had neighborhood activities. While I might be on the older side I would not want to be the talker amongst the mute. I am the one who has neighbors who borrow a cup of sugar, a cold beer, where the better-behaved kids may use our basketball hoop in the backyard, etc.  

  So, could someone provide more info about this area?

"I went to UHCL, but not for that major. The good thing about UHCL is that it’s smaller so you can have more 1 on 1 with your professors. 

However, two things I’d note:

-School bookstore like any other is expensive. My preferred method for getting books is bigwords.com because it’ll find the cheap book online.

-Since it is a small school, it has smaller resources for networking and jobs. Start networking now and seize whatever resource you can. Do a google search for any professional associations with your career field, make a good business card and get started. I made MANY connections that way.

Dragon fries were alright but they were a light dusting of some black pepper and some other hotter pepper that built up over time. Beer selection was limited and priced about average.

For the price and quality of food I'd recommend Popeyes over this to be honest. If you want decent not chicken then you're still going to have to make the hike into town for Mico's/Birdhaus/Mainchick. I was excited to see a hot chicken place opening nearby but this place misses the mark.",t2_wcw6f,ElonVonBraun,0,1628913940.0,0,t1_h8vfjfj,h8vfjfj,True,[deleted],t3_p25o3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/clearlake/comments/p25o3u/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/clearlake/comments/p25o3u/deleted_by_user/h8vfjfj/,3,r/clearlake,0,3

"Native 43 y/o Houstonian here.  Been in this area for 17 years.  Stayed in Webster '04-05, in Bay Pointe for 8 years, been in Pine Brook since '13.  Webster & into the south part of Clear Lake used to be somewhat yuppie when NASA contractors had a lot of work.  Had a good time there in my mid 20s!  Hazy memories, but I remember visiting a coworker at one Webster apartment complex and it was a freakin' nonstop party every day.  Beer, weed, music, food, skateboarding near it, etc.  But when NASA went down, that area gradually ""diversified"" and then poverty & crime followed.  Otherwise the rest of Clear Lake hasn't really changed much.

Bay Pointe- mixed white & blue collar.  Kinda nosy neighbors.  Pine Brook is white collar.  More respectful neighbors.  My current neighbors are engineers, dentists, lawyers, professors, business owners.  Also met a few fakes that vanished in the wind.  In both neighborhoods a lot of retirees stay put.  Had 3 neighbors pass away over the years.  Good mix of kids here.  Overall a nerdy population that is not materialistic or snobby outside of good investments.  Racially it is almost all white & Asian, a little Mexican, near zero black.  Lots of immigrants from all over Asia and Europe.  Chem engineers working for ""big chemical"" quickly replaced NASA engineers after the crash and have kept this place going.  The remaining NASA clique lets you know they're still around as they inject themselves into local spotlights, volunteer work, etc.   Volunteer with some of them and you'll understand why they say government workers = incompetence.  Not all, of course.

Anyway, I have kids and this has been a great place to raise them.  Schools are competitive but not too hardcore.  My kids made friends easily, my neighbors are all good and the community is caring.  Lots of really good kids here, even they are clueless from living in this bubble.  Believe it or not I've been victim to zero crime here, heard of a few things but have witnessed nothing.  Kemah, Galveston and the inner city are all convenient.  We even have a lot of good mom & pop restaurants we rotate through.  The only deal is- after 17 years this place has become boring!  Still a pretty good place to be stuck between work, kids and side projects.",t2_2lnfb815,former_weed_head,0,1624928741.0,0,t1_h3dzos0,h3dzos0,True,[deleted],t3_o308vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/clearlake/comments/o308vw/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/clearlake/comments/o308vw/deleted_by_user/h3dzos0/,2,r/clearlake,0,2

"Mostly agree, but note that League City is huge and has diverse areas much like Clear Lake.  There are areas of Friendswood, League City, and Clear Lake that are like Eagleton. But real life applies, so this is not homogeneous.  Agree with one of the other commenters below that said Clear Lake is “aging less than gracefully”.  That’s true in certain areas.  Seabrook had small town appeal, but the increased traffic on 146 and freeway expansion detract from that IMO. All of them have nice pockets generally.  Nasssu Bay is the most self-enclosed insular (and small), but has older homes with foundation problems and flooding.  There is some of that in most of these communities.  The newer developments will be built up higher and maybe have better slab construction (old Clear Lake - Oak Brook, Oak Brook West, maybe Meadowgreen?, Clear Lake Forest, Nassau Bay, El Lago- is perhaps worst for foundations - built in early 60s on 4” slabs, not post-tensioned, shell-aggregate driveways and garage slabs in some cases). I’ve lived in like 5 of the areas plus Pearland.

"I've lived in this area most of my life. Do you watch Parks and Rec? League City is Eagleton. Dickinson is Pawnee. Clear Lake is technically Houston and is mostly neighborhoods, NASA, and contractors. It's also very diverse. It's a well off area without feeling snotty, and in general there's a mix of upper to lower middle class in its bounds. Nassau Bay is its own little enclave that is really a part of the Clear Lake area. Webster is a smaller and quite commercial area that also blends into the greater Clear Lake area. Seabrook is the part of the coast that feels more connected to Clear Lake, with plenty of neighborhoods and local eateries and small commercial areas. Kemah, on the other side of the bridge, has the touristy Boardwalk district but still has parts that feel like a fishing town. Friendswood is a nice little suburban small town and it really does strive to have that quintessential small town vibe. It has an excellent parks department, lots of community events, and decent neighborhoods.

We put 10% down, and then made a few bulk payments, and to remove PMI was very easy with JSC. Same goes with all escrow requirements and removing them.

"Some random stuff:

I'm one of those rare native Houstonians, grew up on the SW side in the 80s and 90s, been living in the Houston proper part of Clear Lake since 2004.  Back then when the Shuttle program was going strong there was a sizable # of young singles here.  I'm a married w/ kids guy, but it appears most of that scene disappeared after the shuttle was retired.  The lifestyle here has mainly catered to families.

I recently lived in Pennsylvania... and if you are coming from an east coast city you may find this place boring, lacking appreciation for the arts, poor walkability outside of a few spots, with crappy parks and atrocious commercial development.  I never really noticed this until I moved back here after being away for 2 years.  The NE also has a breed of extremely competitive and unlikable characters you won't find here.  The majority of people who consider themselves ""competitive"" here would get slaughtered up there.  But- people are much happier here and that counts for a lot to me.

I think it should easy to find people of all political beliefs in the Houston and Webster parts, but keep in mind a TX Democrat may seem like a NJ Republican.  Once you get to Nassau Bay, Seabrook, El Lago, Kemah- that is teabagger country where some people are still flying Trump 2020 and rebel flags.  Outside of that, a piece of of South Pasadena, Bacliff & Santa Fe are Aryan/White Knight country.  Regardless of that I find most people are pretty pleasant and it is more relaxed than the city & most of the bigger burbs.

As for places to eat there are plenty of established mid-tier, independently owned & diverse places to choose from.  We can't seem to support fine dining, and lack exotic African food you'll find in the International District.  But we have just about everything else within a 5-15 minute drive.  Many restaurants are tucked away in nondescript strip malls that are also tucked away behind a cube shaped CVS or Firestone (remember- atrocious commercial development).  Also, the newish HEB on Clear Lake City Blvd is a nice big grocery store, and has many Central Market items.  (Central Market is a high end store in the wealthy part of the city core.)

"Two Options right now (subject to change).
Live in Clear Lake and WFH.
Live in “the loop” (inside of 610) and WFH.

If you want a city vibe live in Montrose (south of gray, north of Richmond). Expect about 1100-1400 per month. If you want suburbs live in Nassau Bay. It’s right across the street and has biking access to restaurants and the only coffee shop (JavaOwl). If you reallly want a secluded suburb, I’d look at middlebrook. Not to pricey, not to posh. Just north of site and it has a massive park buried in the neighborhood.

Outside of that I would do research on the location of things that you are into and compare that to how far you are willing to commute for work.

Based on my friends that work at nasa I wouldn’t be surprised if your work culture stayed in the high strung arena. Clear Lake itself is more laid back than “in town” (Houston proper). Definitely a driving town and we are terrible drivers so that’s fun (pretty aggressive) and traffic sucks. So you’ll probably want to live closer to work than deal with that commute. Houston is very diverse and has great food. Houston proper is very liberal and that fluctuates the further away you travel. It’s pretty mixed in clear lake. But if you don’t want to talk politics then don’t. But yeah you’ll be surrounded by conservative thought no doubt. It is what it is. Houston is large. Really spread out. Most of my friends live in Houston but I only see half of them regularly because the other half live too far away. An hour drive and still in Houston lol. I feel since you know Florida it would be an easy transition.

"I've lived in this area for many years. Like everywhere, there are pockets of things you'll like and things you won't like. There are four ""major"" cities around clear lake. Kemah, League City, Webster, and the City of Clear Lake. Most of them end up with a ""Houston"" mailing address.

Alright, so Webster is a normal little suburb community. It's got neighborhoods and typical suburban life. I personally don't think its special, but of course, it has its charm. There's a dance club call ""The Hop"" that takes you back to like 1970. There are some great little breweries and bars. Overall, Webster is a great place to raise kids and escape big city life. 

League City is a suburb of Houston all the way. It's got it's main street downtown, which is charming, but it's really nothing special. I'd say it's a run of the mill town/city for Texas. That doesn't make it bad. It's got good city services, nice areas of town, great little neighborhoods, and decent apartment living. It's also got easy access to I-45 which is the main way to get downtown on a Friday night.

I'd say Clear Lake really consists of a bunch of smaller townships - but those people will argue. Clear Lake is a little nicer area, but still a 'burb. It seems to be mostly neighborhoods or grocery stores. I wouldn't call it anything special, but if you have kids they do have a good school system.

Lastly, there's Kemah. Now Kemah is a beach town without the beach. They are built around a nautical community and I, personally, love the town. They have a boardwalk with rides and restaurants, they have tons of marinas, they have lots of water front property, and they have a chill vibe that typically allows golf carts just about anywhere. I have lived in Kemah for about two full years, before that I was in League City, before that I was in Webster/Clear Lake. Overall, I like Kemah. It's just funkier and feels like not a typical suburb.

All of the Clear Lake area is about 30 mins from Galveston. It's also about 30 mins from downtown Houston. That means jobs are plentiful and entertainment is never far away. The people are normal for anywhere - you'll find radical liberals and extremists right wingers. You'll find a lot of people somewhere in the middle that agree with both sides on different issues. You'll find people willing to tow your boat in when the engine quits and assholes that won't return your hat when it blows off your boat. You'll find dog lovers and cat people. But overall, if you put yourself out there, you'll find a group of people you get. 

So if you're moving from DC I think you'll find better traffic, fewer people, and more water sports opportunities. I hope you find it as rewarding to live here as I have in the last several years.",t2_fp6dy,Regel_1999,0,1615675201.0,0,t1_gquctmh,gquctmh,True,[deleted],t3_m4ev67,https://www.reddit.com/r/clearlake/comments/m4ev67/thinking_of_moving_to_houstonclear_lake_area_from/,Thinking of moving to Houston/Clear Lake area from DC.

"It’s friendly, fairly laid back, and warm. The springs and fall weather is great. Summer is hot, but summer nights are actually really nice. I love to go down to the museum district in Houston and see plays at Miller Outdoor Theater, or relax near the water. We are super close to the beach and clear lake has lots of waterfront stuff just a few minutes from NASA. All over town there are some really cool places to hang out and awesome places for beer and food. You just sorta have to know where to look. Check out places like Axelrad Beer Garden (then let Google show you similar places). 

Definitely a driving city though, and humid, but I’m sure you’re used to that.

Just back from the HEB on Clear Lake Blvd.

While they are limiting it to one case, they have pallets of water set up at the entrance. Had plenty of fresh meat. Fish department wasn't open though. Some empty shelves...

Was a bit busy but most people were doing well. A few in full hurricane mode though. Short line to check out. HEB workers all seemed to have a great attitude.

Stop lights on Bay Area Blvd were not operating. (Between Space Center and Middlebrook.) Traffic was moving well though...

At University Green Townhomes, we seem to be doing relatively well (haven't lost power ... yet). Though, our water slowed to a trickle sometime last night.

"Welcome from a fellow NASA family. A decade ago, you could get a decent sized house in neighborhoods like Bay Glen or Bay Knoll for under 200k. Those same houses have gone up almost 100k in value. I look at HAR all the time and you may occasionally see one under this price in Oakbrook or Camino South, but as someone else recommended, look into the patio homes on the corner of Space Center and Bay Area. Overall Clear Lake is a great, low crime place, very diverse, with good schools and plenty to do for a suburb. I will tell you that the area around El Camino and Bay Area is seen by plenty of locals as some of the most problematic crime wise. Once again, the crime pales in comparison to other places.

"1) I'm sure you'll get lots of recommendations. Really depends on if you're buying an existing house or a new build. A realtor isn't really required for a new build in my experience (although I'm sure they'll tell you otherwise for 6%...)

2) Yes. Neighborhoods can vary pretty dramatically here (and everywhere else). You may actually find you prefer League City, Seabrook, El Lago, Nassau Bay, Friendswood, Pearland or any number of other places once you get down here. Or even living in town and commuting counterflow if you're a fan of the bar scene. All are reasonable enough to get to JSC and have their own advantages and disadvantages.

3) $200k doesn't go as far as you'd think for a detached home in Clear Creek or Friendswood ISD and prices are going crazy around here. HAR.com is probably your best friend to see what you can get for your dollar. You don't provide much detail on what you're looking for, but you might look at some of the townhomes near UHCL or along the former golf course that ran parallel to Space Center Blvd (now a green space/drainage retention).

KEMAH

Late-night crowds in Kemah’s entertainment district have gotten rowdier — and, some people argue, shadier and scarier — since police presence dropped off because of cuts in city spending. Some bar owners and residents now worry about the safety of their visitors and employees.

The city’s entertainment district long has attracted big crowds from across the region to a bustling, vibrant array of restaurants, bars and other attractions. It’s known as a family friendly place to eat, drink and be merry.
But since the coronavirus pandemic began, crowds outside the bars after closing time have gotten unrulier, and there are fewer officers patrolling the district because of city budget cuts, according to several business owners in the area.
The bars, some of which are in restaurants and some that have begun selling food so they can operate legally even under a state order closing many drinking establishments in Texas, have been denying some among the new crop of visitors entry into their facilities, said Jordan Paultz, general manager of operations at Voodoo Hut, 511 Bradford Ave.
“The people we’re denying from the bar are not in a good headspace,” he said. “Some are angry, upset and distraught and we have to deny them because of liability. But if we can’t let them into the businesses, then they roam around the streets. And, without adequate police presence, people get hurt.”

Some of Paultz’s bartenders and other employees have told him they feel so unsafe that the bar’s bouncers escort them to their vehicles at the end of the night, he said.
After a man was wounded earlier this month in a shooting in the district, bar owners and concerned residents banded together to voice concern about safety and asked city officials to spend money staffing the police department.
“We want to protect our guests and make sure they are safe when they come down to Kemah,” Paultz said. “We can’t police the streets ourselves, which is where people are getting hurt. We need the council to fund the police department and hire more officers.”

‘COMPLEX SITUATION’

Mayor Terri Gale on Thursday told The Daily News she shared residents’ and business owners’ concerns for safety, that the department was recruiting officers and that the coronavirus pandemic temporarily hurt the city’s staffing.
Safety is always a top priority, she said.
“It’s a complex situation,” she said. “We’re working through improvements not only toward bolstering the police back to full strength but also with more lighting and cameras. We’re trying different techniques to make sure we’re doing all we can to support businesses.”
The tension has been building in town since officers on Sept. 13, responding to two shots they heard while on foot patrol, found a man on the pavement, fading in and out of consciousness, in the 600 block of Sixth Street, officials said.
The incident happened at about 2:04 a.m., police said.
Emergency personnel transported the 23-year-old victim to a hospital, where he has been recovering, but investigators haven’t yet found the person responsible for the shooting, police said Thursday.
Investigators believe the shooting occurred in the street, with the victim on foot and the shooter in a car, police said.

SIGNIFICANT CUTS

Investigators are looking for a man in a black, four-door Cadillac car, police said.
Community members in the days after the shooting gathered at Voodoo Hut to voice their concerns about safety, particularly as it relates to police presence in the district, and plan to have more meetings in the future, Paultz said.
“The community as a whole is kind of worried about it,” said Zach Buster, a manager at Skallywag Suds N’ Grub, 600 6th St. “We’re all doing the best we can to minimize instances like that.”
Kemah, the small city of about 2,000 people in the northeast part of the county, in April made significant cuts to its budget in response to concern about the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Gale said.
Unlike many cities, Kemah makes most of its operating revenue from sales tax and mixed beverage taxes, both of which were expected to take hard hits from government-ordered COVID-19 closures and restrictions.
As part of those cuts, two police officers from the city’s 15-person department were furloughed, with no clear indication about when or whether they’d return to work, and all unfilled job positions were removed from the budget.
Those cuts hit a department that already was down four or five officers when Gale took over as mayor, she said.
“It was never our intention to remove officers from the street so much as when we had resignations, we’d been working to backfill those positions,” she said. “And the council felt, particularly with the diminishing police calls we were experiencing in early 2020 that, once the virus hit, we didn’t need more than two or three officers on duty at a time.”

‘DISGUSTING- LOOKING THUGS’

But Kemah, despite initially dire projections, has emerged better than expected from the pandemic financially and has been actively recruiting officers since May or June, Gale said.
The city’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year projects sales tax revenue at about $3.5 million, down from $3.7 million during the 2018-2019 fiscal year but up slightly from $3.3 million this year.
The city already has converted one officer from part-time to full-time to fill an open position, and another officer should start sometime in the next few weeks, she said.
But some Kemah leaders have been worried about safety in the entertainment district even before the shooting.
Former Mayor Matt Wiggins, in June, wrote to members of council to express concern about safety around closing time.
Wiggins did not respond to several requests for comment Thursday, but he posted the email on his social media profile.
“Last night I arrived on Sixth Street at 1:45 a.m. and left at 2:45 a.m.,” he wrote. “There was absolutely no KPD presence during this time. Sixth Street was full of some of the most disgusting-looking thugs I have ever seen.”
Wiggins saw two fights and signs of drug trafficking, he said.
Paultz, however, disagreed with the characterization of gangs outside the bars but said some visitors have been more on edge since the start of the pandemic.
