>One persons trash is another‚Äôs treasure they say. If you don‚Äôt like it here leave. It‚Äôs that simple. Pretty sure you‚Äôll be complaining any where you go.

Everything about this is dumb trashy copium speaking. 1-One person's trash is another man's treasure doesn't apply to literal garbage littered on the side of the road.... No. That's just trash.

2- Saying if you don't like it then leave is stupid and how places get left in the past. Literally promoting stagnation. A healthy place is constantly changing and growing. If you don't like the litter, poor driving culture, and homelessness we should just get out? How about trying to help heal the city instead of just lashing out at anyone who dares criticize it.

3- The assumption that they'd be unhappy anywhere. Nah, you don't get to assume that just because somebody doesn't like your home. That's just you looking for a sassy way to close our your comment.

"I would agree that the income disparities that cause these issues should be examined. Living wages, health/day care, rising costs of education, etc... we should be taking a serious look at these issues and be open to addressing them. We also need to abandon the zero-sum mentality that assumes to give to one group somehow takes away from another.  

This is probably the only way forward here, as people living in poorer neighborhoods can't afford to move out, and wealthier people moving in would bring gentrification that the current residents also can't afford.

I also believe in having respect for your neighborhood and the needs of your neighbors.

My street is quiet and the people are fine. There‚Äôs crime yes, but not much different from the rest of the city, statistically. 
Anecdotal, yes. But my experience from a lifetime of living all over San Antonio is that the communities are more or less the same in terms of safety, but extremely segregated by race.

"Things we wanted in a house when we moved to San Antonio:

* a good kitchen (gas stove, double ovens, decent amount of cabinet space, no garbage island fucking up the flow)
* a pantry
* a decent yard for the dog
* within a 30m commute during peak hours for Mrpantzen to get to work
* good closets
* individual mailboxes
* no gate
* no HOA
* enclosed and attached parking
* 2200-2800 sqft, at least two bathrooms
* around 350k (this was years ago, so that was not a ridiculous ask)
* not Pulte or DR Horton

He moved here six months before I did, and we spent four months actively looking where I would look through the new listings online, pare them down, and he'd or we'd go look at them in person on the weekends. All in, we toured over 100 houses and lost bids on two others before purchasing this one.

What we actually got

* a good kitchen (gas stove, double ovens, decent amount of cabinet space, no garbage island fucking up the flow)
* a pantry
* a ~~decent~~ small yard for the dog, but at least she can poop without being leashed
* within a 30m commute during peak hours for Mrpantzen to get to work
* ~~good~~ dinky closets
* ~~individual~~ cluster mailboxes
* ~~no gate~~ gated
* ~~no HOA~~ not one, but two HOAs
* enclosed and attached parking
* ~~2200-2800~~ 3k sqft, at least two bathrooms
* around 350k (this was years ago, so that was not a ridiculous ask)
* not Pulte or DR Horton

We had hoped to rent for a year before buying so we could learn the city more, and if we had, we would have ended up in a different area, but finding somewhere within that commute radius that would rent to us with a >100lb dog that wasn't falling apart or leased before we could see it in person proved impossible.

"I live in the Converse area but worked over off I-10 DeZavala for 8 years. I would have to leave at 630 to get to work at 8 am and was almost always late. Traffic sucked and I was spending crazy amounts on gas just to get to work. I researched taking the bus and found a route that would dump me right in front of the building I worked in, and got me to work 45 minutes earlier than driving and usually got me home around the same time (parking at park and ride off Randolph Blvd). Not only did I save somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 grand a year on gas, but the bus pass at the time was $30 and I could hop on any bus that passed my job and go have lunch somewhere other than drive thru, shop, or whatever. I'll also admit I was much nicer and more relaxed when I got home and was ready to work when I arrived at the office. It was the best decision I ever made and frankly, I enjoyed all the different personalities you'd encounter on the bus. I met some really cool people from different walks of life and we hard core looked out for each other. There's always riff raff if you take any of the looper routes, so the express 17 was bomb, as it left the park and ride, hit downtown before the congestion started, stopped at I think 4-5 stops downtown then hit I-10 to the park and ride at 1604/10. I had to get off the 17 and catch the second bus, which was less than 5 minutes from my office.

"Do you have access to your filters? If so change them. If that does not help put the unit on circulate without cold or heat to possibly defrost the coils. It may be frozen over usually happens when the filter is very dirty.  If That does not help write your  request to fix your AC now via certified letter to your landlord.

Do you have access to see your indoor AC unit? Possibly in a closet. If so see if you can see the actual coils to see if they are dirty. It‚Äôll look like caked on mud. Again happens when the filter is dirty and older tenants used shit filters. Don‚Äôt try to clean the coil you will only fuck it up more.  If it‚Äôs dirty write your  request to fix your AC now via certified letter to your landlord.

Do you have access to your outside unit? If so ask someone to turn on your AC. When they do does your unit actually turn on and spin the fan? Or just make a buzz sound. If no fan then it‚Äôs the capacitor, these break alll the fucking time and are easy to fix.  To fix write your  request to fix your AC now via certified letter.  

The reason I say write your  request to fix your AC now via certified letter is that the certified letter means you know the law and you mean business. You can certainly take in a hand written letter to request but they may point you to some online portal or some bs nowadays. If they insist ask for a written reciept that your request has been received. Should be easy again it means you know the law. Apartment AC units are usually bottom of the barrel contractor grade so be prepared for a fight to keep it cool this summer if you don‚Äôt get it fixed now.

Do you think the city should be given carte blanche to do whatever it wants, for whatever reason it wants, regardless of what we the people want?

With regards to what restaurants are allowed to operate within the airport, the only thing the city should concern itself with is the restaurants paying  their rent on time and maintaining compliance with health codes. The restaurant operator is the one who should assume the risk of things like negative PR associated with their brand.

"Search for auto damage adjuster with literally any major auto insurance carrier in the area. Most start between 40k and 60k and require no experience. If you hustle you can climb pretty quickly salary wise and get into the 80s/90s within 5 to 6 years or significantly faster if you move into supervisor and management roles. 

Many prefer you to have zero experience so they can train you in the way they want you to perform. Work from home or field options are available. Usually Monday through Friday 8 to 430 hours.

Full disclaimer though most days can be chill but often it isn't easy, shops are full of shit, company expectations (like any major company) can be ridiculous, and customers are assholes.

I understand the contradiction between my YIMBY transit oriented beliefs and my commodity fetishization, so I bike most of the time when I need to commute to a place within 5 miles. Biking keeps me in shape and helps me save on gas. I can go several days in a row without even wanting to take the pickup because I live reletively close to everything I need.

Maybe I'm justifying my car-brained faults post hoc, but I think my big beautiful pickup is better off sitting in my carport than in the hands of some suburbinite who's just going to commute 40 miles a day at 15 mpg in it.",t2_9qgomj99,Jaded-Recognition-31,0,1648827109.0,0,t1_i2zt5km,i2zt5km,False,Jaded-Recognition-31,t3_ts8wdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanantonio/comments/ts8wdq/san_antonio_is_the_largest_city_in_america/,San Antonio is the largest city in America without light rail.
