"“The Authentic History of Cincinnati Chili” by Dan Woellert. 

>	Woellert writes that ""the Kiradjieffs took a meat stew with traditional Mediterranean spices like cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg and added chili powder, along with other spices familiar to their Slavic Mediterranean upbringing."" As Woellert comments, it would have probably been far more accurate to call what they served an ""Americanized Greek stew,"" but that doesn't have much of a ring to it, does it?

"Yup. Nick Buonicanti was an attorney and a member of our TravelClick corporate board.

In fact, he shared an office in a vestibule between their two rooms in a hotel they lived in on Park Avenue in New York City with our co-CEO, Richard Gray.

As we all know, Nick's son Mark was paralyzed in a college football game at the age of 19, so Richard has always been involved with Nick and his spinal cord research with the Miami Project, which has raised millions.

Nick and Richard enjoyed being pals and they would do things like go to the Lima, Peru fine art museum. Richard had an office there.

As you can see from a prior posting, I was a friend of the late Mosi Tatupu of the Patriots and Rams.

I visited Mosi outside Boston in December, 1980. That's where I met Haynes. The thing I was most impressed with was how intelligent the other players on the team were. 

Larry McGrew, Don Hasslebeck (father of Matt), Roland James, Haynes, John Hannah.

My nearby neighbor and classmate, Gary Carano, runs the biggest casino conglomerate in America. He was our high school quarterback and center. 

His brother Glenn played as a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys for 7 years. He now works with Gary. 

One of our basketball team's two forward, Mike Bodney, spent time on the PGA tour before becoming a VP at the PGA.

It really is time to put the dumb lazy jock stereotype to rest.

Note about Lima Art Museum: 

The permanent collection includes representative pieces by Peru’s dominant historical cultures, including the Moche, Vicus, Nazca, Chimú, Chancay, and Ica-Chinca. 

Each exhibit reveals the characteristics distinct to each culture and notes developments in technologies, processes, customs, and art forms, while also tracing a legacy of continuity evident through contemporary works. 

Historical pieces on display include trophy heads, statues, ceramics, and textiles, as well as decorative and ceremonial objects.

The museum contrasts these ancient art pieces with rooms devoted to modern and contemporary works.

This latter collection begins with the 1940s, a period that ushered in the country’s first modern art, and includes pieces by Peruvian artists working in a number of styles, notably abstract, postmodern, and Pop art, and paintings by such Peruvian masters as Macedonio de la Torre, Francisco Mariotti, and Jorge Eduardo Eielson. 

The museum holds a number of significant pieces by Fernando de Szyszlo, considered the father of Peru’s abstract movement.

There were trees planted between the sidewalks and the road. One home had a lot of property and a lake. At Christmas they set up a life size nativity, built a small fence, and had live animals. 

I haven’t been to Fort Thomas in over forty years, but some of my happiest memories are from there.

"Do you know him? I have a friend named Mike Haynes who is in the NFL Hall of Fame.

He once was the highest paid defensive player in the NFL.

During one of his appearences in the Pro Bowl in Honolulu, he invited me to his hotel room the evening before the game. His wife was out shopping for souvenirs.

When I entered the room, the first thing I noticed was a pile of about 15 books on the bed.

So he said, ""You know, I would like to stand here and beat on my chest about being some great football player but the fact is, I could get hurt tomorrow and never be able to play again. Then what would I do if I didn't have an education?""

""So right after the game I'm going to kiss my wife and then fly back to Arizona to take my finals on Monday""

Now keep in mind, he'd been an NFL player for about 3 years before that, but despite the money, he vowed to get an education.

The man played in the Bowl NINE times. He is now a VP at a large corporation.

Another of my friends played in the NFL for 14 years. He has passed away but his name was Mosi Tatupu.

He also earned his degree and even went to one of the top high school s in America, Honolulu's Punahou. Barack Obama, Steve Case, Michelle Wie and many others also attended the school.

So your notion of people being good athletes who don't care about education appears to stem from something else from inside of you.

"I'm a straight ticket Democratic voter, but reporting from [the hill](https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/600374-rand-paul-cuts-deal-on-russia-trade-bill/)  characterizes this as a disagreement about the vagueness of the language in the bill around what qualified as a human rights violation.  Maybe this wasn't a genuine criticism, all I have is the reporting and I'm not invested enough to read the bill, but it's at least plausible to me he has a legitimate concern.

Quotes from the hill article:

>The original Magnitsky bill targeted “gross” violations of human rights.The language in a bill approved by the House and now under consideration by the Senate would expand that to target “serious” human rights violations, codifying language used in a Trump-era executive order.  
>  
>As part of the deal with Paul, senators agreed to keep the “serious” violation phrasing but provided a definition for what would qualify.  
>  
>Thune said the concern with the original House language “was too broadly defined.”  
>  
>“They were willing to accept changes. … They just had a mind meld,” Thune said.

Considering how the vagueness of the patriot act is something I think we'd all agree was determent to  citizens privacy, it's probably good at least someone is trying to make the language of the bill more specific, even if that guy is generally an ass 99% of the time.  Broken clocks and what not.

Edit: and I know this take is probably unpopular, but a problem with politics in this country right now is that nobody takes the time to listen, everything is editorialized, and we're too lazy to even try; deferring to the color of the persons political party instead of the contents of their words.",t2_7ea19,GraphicH,0,1648905074.0,0,t1_i33rmki,i33rmki,True,snooshoe,t3_tu340e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kentucky/comments/tu340e/rands_latest_stand_undercuts_gops_ukraine_message/,Rand's latest stand undercuts GOP's Ukraine message,/r/Kentucky/comments/tu340e/rands_latest_stand_undercuts_gops_ukraine_message/i33rmki/,1,r/Kentucky,0,1

"The basic recipe is four pounds of ground beef, three pounds of ground onions (we use food processor, original recipe had onions ground in a grinder attached to a chair), about 8 cans (15oz each) of tomato sauce (in the original recipe, they put tomatoes throw a sieve.) Add water. Work this together with hands. Make a spice bag of pickling spices. Add this and a few cayenne peppers. Cook for three to four hours until it is the consistency you desire. 
Refrigerate and remove grease on top. Remove spice bag but squeeze the moisture into the sauce. 

This recipe was not a problem until my kids grew up. Now I have to pull out the big pans so I can triple or quadruple the recipe. On the plus side, it freezes well.

It’s possible that passage of the trade bill, a top priority of Biden’s, could slip late into April at this point.***

Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who recently traveled to Poland, said Paul “has the right” to do it, but it’s “not helpful” for her party’s message.  And after a lengthy sigh, Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) put it even more bluntly when asked about Paul: “It’s what we’ve come to expect.”***

They get a little light from led plant lights but not much really.  I get very little natural light so it has surprised me in how well it has done.    I get a little of a morning but only a couple hours due to our porch and home design.  Also plant lighting is very affordable these days and you don't have to have expensive to run and hot HID type lighting.  All you really need is a few led strips from amazon.

"The most enticing and exotic food in Kentucky is caviar. Yes, caviar. Kentucky is known as the best source of caviar in the USA and can be found in many top restaurants in NY and LA.

Most of it is harvested in the Grand Rivers area near Paducah in the south west corner of the state. You can buy it in specialty stores about the state, or online, for about $35/ounce.

"Burgoo and hot browns are the 2 biggest. Burgoo is a stew that uses whatever you can find normally meat wise then corn, onions, and some spice. 

Hot brown is an open faced sandwich. Toasted bread, slice of turkey, slice of ham or bacon, moray sauce. Very common is tomato also. 

Rolled oysters are also a thing. Oysters rolled in cornmeal then fried.

Whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse.

[Proverbs 19:17]

Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed.

Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house; when you see the naked, to cover him, and not to hide yourself from your own flesh?

"Don’t know if this qualifies, but my great grandfather who lived in Kentucky and died in 1933, passed down a recipe for spaghetti sauce that he got from a saloon in Ironton, Ohio. The family has adapted it to modern standards-we use tomato sauce rather than putting tomatoes through a sieve. We use a food processor to grate onions rather than using the old grinders that attached to a chair.

There is a Chinese proverb that I saw once and have never been able to track down again. Basically something bad happens to the son, the father says ""well, it may turn out to be good."" Something good happens to the son, who brags and the father says ""it may turn out to be bad."" And it keeps going back and forth. The truth is that we can never tell.

No. I don't ""take"" any of that. I *pay* for that, above and beyond what I pay in taxes. And taxes don't really correlate to GDP. As you mentioned, GDP shows how much our economy produces. Taxation is technically a drain on GDP, since a large amount of taxes go to fund social services, which of course don't relate to GDP.

>Do you think the government is getting enough to operate and provide for those taking less than you?

It's not the government's role, really, to ""provide"" for people, beyond the military at the federal level, infrastructure at the state level, and fire and police at the local level.

Right. Because high income people currently pay a lot more of the taxes. If you cut taxes across the board, they will obviously most of the benefit. That's math. That's fair.

Let's say I paid $1000 in taxes to Frankfort last year. Let's say my son (who earns a lot less) only paid $100. If you cut taxes by 10%, then I get $100 back, and he gets back $10.

In June or July they have the Hatfield McCoy Festival. It is small but they have tours in Pikeville to WV. They have a marathon race that is known nationwide to runners. If you geocache they have a series out that is exploding. Go to the Breaks when you are here. If you need a contact for more info DM me. I’ll help you out the best I can.

"Kentucky Republicans are absolute idiots.

Kansas tried this nonsense in like 2012. Gov Brownback and his minions claimed tax cuts would bring amazing wealth and bounty.

Nope. Kansas couldn't raise enough money to maintain roads, schools, higher education or pay people. Couldn't even conduct business after about 18 months. Sam Brownback claimed they had not cut taxes deep enough but by that time even the Kansas Republicans who are nearly flat-earthers had had enough and they rescinded all the tax cuts. And they still haven't really recovered and that was almost a decade ago.

Oklahoma did the same thing at the same time, had the same resultz and rescinded their tax cuts, too.

"I grew up there so I’ll throw some suggestions at’chya. Jenny Wiley festival in Prestonsburg is calm but decent with performances at night and good food. Billy Rays restaurant is great to walk to from that festival if you aren’t feeling their deep fried food. Apple festival in Paintsville is always pretty lit, as is everyone there lol. But, there’s a good amount you can do there during the event and it lasts about 3-4 days. Great food to! Hillbilly days also have very drunk people but it can be awesome with the right company. I have an insane story form that event lol… 

You could take a drive around the lakes, Dewey lake in Floyd co. is very curvy, but a beautiful scene. The lodge has a lot of events and live shows performed that you can check out. Sometimes the shows are about local history or it could be Rocky Horror Picture Show. Heard from a couple workers that the dining area is haunted so beware or book a room! If you want a cabin you could get one there instead (they’re not bad!) If you go around Halloween time definitely go to the Paintsville haunted trail at the Mountain Home Place. It’s actually pretty fun, with a nice walk over the river on a big bridge. 

Definitely try Small Town in Pikeville KY if you’re feeling frisky for a tattoo. There was a cool little comic book shop in Pikeville with some interesting finds, if you’re into that. (Page-3’s Game Zone) it’s humble but cool shit in there. 

The Brick House in Prestonsburg is owned by a good friend of mine, she has painted a ton of art lately so that restaurant has probably gained a gorgeous artistic scene inside. They also have live music there if you wanna check the local talent. El Azul is the best Mexican food, you gotta go. Lizzie B’s is also a local talent lover and have really good food; but small inside with odd seating. If you like antique shops Prestonsburg, Johnson county and, Pikeville are good finds. I’m a fan of a couple of shops on Johnson county that have a whole variety ranging from furniture to old toys.
