"I'm up north, in Rockaway. I don't have much yard at all, but I'm 2 minutes from the beach, and close to forest and several parks. I agree that I got a good deal, but I have definitely seen stuff around 300 that is decent. The one thing I'm not sure of though is how many of those houses would qualify for financing--a lot of the cheaper stuff I see seems to be pretty odd construction, or older manufactured houses. And I know banks often have issues lending for properties like that. So if you need all cash to buy those houses, they aren't really affordable for regular people. 

I just took a look on Zillow though, and you're right--there isn't much available now in that range. When I was looking, I was willing to spend up to 400 if I found something I really wanted, and I was looking from Seaside to Pacific City, and it took a couple months to find much--most of the good stuff that popped up went pending really quickly, I assume for all cash offers.

"Where?! Have you seen what housing prices have done in the past year?  With the exception of Coos Bay/NB, if your house is in any type of decent condition, it's probably worth over $310K by now.  Great timing for you! 

We've been looking and it seems like they're going up about $20K quarterly.  We can't touch anything under $300K, unless it needs another $50-70K of work. And interest rates are going up as well, so that adds another couple hundred to the payment.  Two years ago, I put my nose up at an 800 sq foot in my neighborhood because it was only one bedroom. It was $189K.  In the past 6 months, 2 FIVE HUNDRED square foot houses have sold for $300K!  One 300-something sqft ""studio"" (my realtor told me it was literally a shed in it's previous life) sold for $200K last year. Shit's *insane"", Yo! Congrats on your house though, I'm truly happy for you.

"That's really, really cool. What you have there is likely [False Brain Coral](https://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/visitor-center/found-beach/false-brain-coral), a fairly common coral-like structure made by worm colonies right off the coast. But YOUR specimen appears to be False Brain Coral that is entirely encasing a rock. This means that at some point in the life of the colony, a rock fell on the structure, and the worms continued to build around it and encase it. When the colony died, this piece broke off and washed onto the shore with the tides, much like the rest of the rocks and gravels found on the beaches. In its journey to shore, it likely got tumbled and pulverized by the other rocks around it, which wore down this not-coral to expose the inner rock. If nobody had found this, it would have continued to lose more of the false coral until it was just the rock.

Very unique specimen!

"The daycare that my son currently goes to is $3.60/hr, and they offer a 10% sibling discount, so 2 children would be $6.48/hr. I don‚Äôt know how many hours they are there per month, but 160 is pretty typical, and that would 1,036 dollars. 

There are a couple downsides, though. They have pretty limited hours; 7:15 AM - 5:45 PM. They are part of the school district as well, so they take a lot of days off. 

However, it‚Äôs a great daycare. Tons of activities. My son goes to preschool just down the hall. Kindergarten and first grade are also in the same building. Other students are bussed to their school. 

But I would say that the biggest issue, in my anecdotal experience, isn‚Äôt so much price, but availability. My son‚Äôs last daycare provider (who charged us a $600 flat rate) retired a about a year ago. There was absolutely no daycare availability (the pandemic certainly didn‚Äôt help). I had to quit my job to stay home with him. I was out of work for months until I could *finally* get my son into daycare. We just happened to get lucky that a kid at my son‚Äôs preschool moved away, and my son‚Äôs teacher gave us a heads up that it also meant that a daycare slot opened up.",t2_12m5ev,Kriscolvin55,0,1645469025.0,0,t1_hxv3fsa,hxv3fsa,False,spakky,t3_gux9qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonCoast/comments/gux9qm/general_job_market_along_the_coastal_cities/,General job market along the coastal cities?,/r/OregonCoast/comments/gux9qm/general_job_market_along_the_coastal_cities/hxv3fsa/,1,r/OregonCoast,0,1

"To whomever downvoted this, trying to keep people from knowing where your ""secret place"" is:

The above-referenced episode took place in the **early 80s**, probably *before you were even born*.  Lots of us have been here on the Coast and have explored its nooks and crannies far longer than you have; in fact, I was dragged to that spot by an older friend who had discovered it about five years earlier.  This place doesn't *belong* exclusively to you.

Even so, if you had actually *read* my comment, you would understand that what I was doing was trying to **deter** people from going to your precious ""secret spot"".  What we did that time was dangerous - and we were young, fit and healthy, but we could have been seriously hurt because of our foolhardiness.

I had a wonderful ""secret spot"" of my own up near Cape Perpetua that I freely shared with (mostly non-local) friends, because it was so amazing.  It's now part of a formal viewing spot - evidently I wasn't the only one who knew about it - probably because *its* access wasn't entirely safe, especially in wet weather.  I miss the place, but I don't begrudge those who do enjoy it now.

As I said, the Coast doesn't exclusively belong to you - and as much as we decry the tourists crowding in and ruining everything, it doesn't belong to us locals, either.  If you want to cut down on the excessive tourist traffic and overuse of public lands in our area, then do your bit to help governments curb the overabundance of short-term rentals that drive this traffic - and squeeze us locals out of decent and affordable housing in the process as well.",t2_95qb3auj,DevilsChurn,0,1645312869.0,0,t1_hxmyvua,hxmyvua,False,slayer1am,t3_sugpnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonCoast/comments/sugpnu/found_this_awesome_spot_between_florence_and_the/,Found this awesome spot between Florence and the Sea Lion Caves.,/r/OregonCoast/comments/sugpnu/found_this_awesome_spot_between_florence_and_the/hxmyvua/,1,r/OregonCoast,0,1

"I can only answer for Brookings, as I don't spend enough time in Crescent City or Gold Beach to give a fair, full answer. I'll start by saying it's absolutely beautiful. The weather is usually 50s- 70s, foggy when it's hot further inland, and rainy during fall/winter. It gets below freezing a few times a year, but usually only at night and it's short-lived. 

I don't know what the wages are for your field, but cost of living is rising and a lot of locals struggle in lower wage jobs. Basic food and necessities are standard prices, though our shelves get pretty picked over when there's any supply chain hiccups and also during tourist season. Home prices have practically doubled over the last few years, rentals are very hard to come by, and I know several people who had their rental homes put on the market with no warning. There are plenty of vacation rentals though (*sigh*). Housing is a serious issue in Brookings.

Basic healthcare is available locally, but anything specialized goes to Medford or Coos Bay, if not farther. There's also only one pharmacy in town now, so expect long wait times and long lines.

The area leans red, but most of it isn't vocal. There are a few very 'loud and proud' people who definitely cross the line of basic decency, though. The elected officials in the area are hard right. They govern accordingly.

Not sure of your position in regards to covid, but this area isn't very careful. Mask wearing was never great, but it was down to about 50% during Delta and is less than 25% now. People refused to mask up even in healthcare settings and a few were very confrontational about it. I think we're over 60% vaxed at this point, but that was only after employers started to require it (and many employees received exemptions).

Schools are struggling to maintain staff. There aren't enough subs to go around, but most of the teachers really try their best with what they have. There are bullying issues for students outside the ""norm"". 

There are homeless people in the area. In fact, Brookings made national news in the past few weeks because of it. A quick Google should explain that better than I could. That's an issue you'll find all along the coast, though. The fires, covid, housing issues, and economic struggles have only made it worse over the past few years and I don't see it getting better until we address that on a national scale.

Hope this helps.

"Chiming on on Oregon Coast. My father lives in Gold Beach since 1994, and there is really nothing there. He was on the chamber of commerce for two decades and also a director of the Gold Beach fair board (since retired). Gold Beach has a lot of aged people who do not want to see the town changed. The fair board is trying to destroy the fairgrounds so they can sell it - and make way for condos. Besides Jerry Rogue Jets, the fairgrounds were the only attraction bringing in business to the town - like the circus and other major events. The schools there have approximately 166 kids in 9-12 grades, so you have a small class. My father says most of those kids leave because there is nothing but seasonal work (restaurants, cleaning gigs, handyman). They have to go instate for college and most never come back. Those who stay never get an education past grade 12. Gold Beach is mostly right wing and a lot of Trump supporters. It does however have one of the best brand new hospitals on the Southern Coast.

There is no real beach access in Gold Beach except on the South part of town or North of the Rogue Jetty, and most if it is covered in logs carried in and out by the storms. This is because of how the airport is on the North end, and condos are along the South - with lots of swampy grass between. Spinner's Restaurant is the best there at about $90 a plate. There is a pretty good pizza place and of course the Port Hole Cafe. There are two very small grocery stores - Rays and McKays. If you need anything more than staples you will have to drive South to Brookings or further to Crescent City (46 miles), or Coos Bay (82 miles) to get to a Walmart or bigger. Port Orford is 31 miles North and has the docks and a couple restaurants (The Crazy Norwegian is always good). It also has the Cape Blanco Light House, but not much else. Port Orford is also a speed trap as it's pretty much how their police get funded, so they're always writing tickets.

Surfing is great down between Myers Creek and Pistol River because of how the coast is shaped there - tons of wind. It's always packed down there with wind surfing - but bring a wet suit because even in summer the Pacific doesn't get much above 54F.

I take my kids out there every year to stay in rental homes which are mostly on the Wedderburn side (North of Gold beach across the bridge). We ride the jet boats, but we spend more time outside of Gold Beach because there isn't anything to do there. We hit Brookings, Crescent City for the redwoods, Bandon for the food and old town, and Coos Bay for the casinos, theaters and food.",t2_4hgh5,Infymus,0,1645199307.0,0,t1_hxgi0iw,hxgi0iw,True,TheOffshoreFlow,t3_sv9xux,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonCoast/comments/sv9xux/crescent_city_vs_brookings_or_gold_beach/,Crescent City Vs.

"Surfing can be had, there is plenty of coastline and Aleutian Juice; but its inconsistent. It gets crazy windy and/ or giant for weeks on end sometimes.  That being said , there is usually a wave somewhere if you are willing to drive. Local knowledge is key to finding spots  that are breaking in adverse conditions.  The big  winds can be out of the south or north so hiding behind different headlands or jettys based on direction is common. 

Cresent City might be the best spot you mentioned overall for surf but also the most crowded.  It's the only town on your list with a surfshop. 

 I love it but it can get kind of one dimensional here. If all you want to do is work and play outside , its great.

"Oregon has no sales tax.

Crescent is ""flat"", Brookings is ""cute"", Gold Beach is ""another hour up the road"" and Port Orford another hour after that, meaning the money and day-trip tourism falls off.  Crescent has walmart and home depot (iirc), brookings has fred meyer (much smaller chain), gold beach has 2 supermarkets, Port Orford has one small one.

A few miles over the border it goes from ""flat"" to ""stunning"" and stays that way until north bend: just amazingly beautiful coastline.

> contractor

There's work, some new builds, but it's not like a metro where 1k boxes go up at once.  We've made quite a few upgrades here and (luckily) no overt eff-ups or lawsuits.  Zoning and natural contours are limiting, but gold beach and to north land $ goes down and rogue river has some amazing views undeveloped.  I imagine if you are a custom architect or journeyman XYZ you could make a name as a specialist.  You can probably get a roofing or framing 40hr easily but not metro wages.

> wages

I'd just cold call a few per city, assume $20-50 max if you are the employee.

> wing

""Soft red"" lumber and fishing meets ""dyed blue"" hippies and artists.  In the middle of Delta about 1/2 of supermarket customers were unmasked, I've caught all 3 variants in the wild due to this, but it's not at all like texas or florida where the stupidity is LOUD.  There were a few trump flags but not anymore and afaik no-one is threatening school boards about CRT.

> schools

Check populations, GB has a graduating class < 100 whereas Crescent >1000 I think.  ""Decent"" = probably, ""exceptional"" = probably not.

> drugs and homeless

Yep, plenty of driftwood washes up, Crescent is the most ""systemic"" (and north cali is not in great economic shape, Yreka was seriously a ghost town last year, like 20% retail occupancy downtown).  Both states have pretty good mental health services and charities (and a lot of residential guns) so theft/break-ins are low.

> surfing

Pistol River is a windsurfing tour spot, 5-12' surf with a smooth break and 30mph winds all summer.  Water is 40f so it's wetsuit and watch out for sneakers and riptide.  There are probably a lot of local secrets.

I would add ""there's no hurry in Curry (county)"": if you are looking for a ""dynamic, forward leaning"" community there isn't one north of Eureka on the 101.  I'm extremely forward leaning and had a few fun years of giving energy to other people who merely dropped the balls when they realized they would have to work a little - a very little.  Enough so that I thought about it and suggest ""there's a lot of retirees"", meaning people on fixed incomes who own houses and have no ambitions beyond enjoying lovely sunsets - they have little incentive to become a leader in off-shore wind/hydro energy and would happily debate for 30 years allowing maybe a university study of the impact on local clams.  I am moving, soon and at a childless unmarried 50yo... bought these 3ac at <250k and it'll sell for >400k after the upgrades... but that's sort of the only impact I have had lol: I have fixed what I can and the rest they just can't see how it's broken.  When fishing and logging are cut to zero it's going to be a sh*tshow but I warned 'em.",t2_meosu,ItAmusesMe,0,1645174444.0,0,t1_hxfbc2a,hxfbc2a,True,TheOffshoreFlow,t3_sv9xux,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonCoast/comments/sv9xux/crescent_city_vs_brookings_or_gold_beach/,Crescent City Vs.

"Southern Oregon Coast is pretty right wing (as in red-neck).  There is a moderately sized liberal arts & healthy-living community in Brookings, but generally speaking small town folks are not very sophisticated, socially or politically.  I think it would be easy to find general contracting work there, but wages are probably lower, as is cost of living, especially housing.  Health care and other services are not great.  

I can‚Äôt imagine there is very good surfing in Brookings... it is stunningly beautiful but the coast is rocky.  Maybe a few good spots, but Im not sure if you would find many good waves.  The weather is warmer than the northern Oregon Coast, less rain, but Crescent City often gets socked in with fog.

"LOL Ikr, arent manatees freakin adorable ?

V true, FL has so manygreat restaurants all over, especially for seafood lovers. Sounds like a nice date! And the sunsets are magnificent in FL.

I will look up where you are at, bc I'm VERY excited to begin traveling throughout OR as soon as my partner finishes school this summer. I started rockhounding during Covid and while the coast and Willamette Valley are good for a lot, there's definitely places I cant wait to visit in central OR and all the way out east as well for plume agates and other stuff u cant get here. (Any idea how the Illinois River is for petrified wood & other pretty stuff/ fossils/ cool rocks? So far riverbank hounding is my favorite)

We both love wilderness areas, especially protected ones and that kalmiopsis spot sounds like a wonderful choice, I appreciate the suggestions! I'm always super eager to hear travel tips from ppl who know and love OR best, I have a bunch of destinations on a list in my fon that I'd never heard of til locals told me abt em and now they're gonna be some of the first places we go once we really get to explore our new home... It's 4 yrs we have been on the coast (lincoln county) but between covid and work/ school, while we have  taken a handful of long weekend roadtrips to explore nearby, there's been only 2 week long trips  to travel- down the coast to the Redwoods (a dream that as a lil kid growing up in NY)and back up as far as home, then next time we saw the rest of the coast, the northern 1/3.

"I hear you!üòä No matter WHAT my day is like, I am so happy and incredibly grateful to live where I do now.
I grew up in the NE, but spent a decade & a half in  FL, just a couple blocks from the beach. When I first got out here if ppl asked where I'd moved from they seemed really surprised I wanted to leave there. (Which, as pale as I am, had ME surprised, I figured it was obvious... Not everyone tans!) Really though, the beach was one of just a small handful of reasons it was *almost* tolerable there, but now that I've experienced the Pacific, there is absolutely no comparison for sheer breathtaking beauty.

The only ways FL *Might* have OR beat is amazing wildlife (though it's close, the Everglades have so many species found Nowhere else! And of course manatees! love those blubbery sea cowsüòä) & awesome, fantastic to behold storms- seeing gigantic ominous thunderclouds roll in over the ocean across an endless sky, followed by an insane electrical storm complete with high winds that from out of nowhere whip everything to a frenzy & lightening displays unlike anywhere else, maybe some pounding hail as well...

There's not too much I miss about FL, (which is sad bc I loved it at first but it became tougher & tougher for ppl just trying to get by, (across the country obviously but it was especially bad there) post 2008 the tourist economy that millions of service workers kept afloat & profitable no longer paid enough of that back for the ever increasing cost of living, wages across the board stagnated as well.

"My wife reminded me that the coast can be very cold. We were there in July/August and there were some 70 degree days and some 50 degree days with very high wind. We literally wore fleece sweaters, raincoats (for windbreaking), and hats and were still cold some days. It's probably warmer closer to California but I would say you should either pack for it or be prepared to buy extra layers if it gets cold.

All times are lovely but the risk of rain is higher the later you go. August is extremely dry inland and it rains very frequently in the winter months. I think my mom would say that September and June are the best months of all.

Alas, it's been almost 20 years since I lived there so I can't speak to weather trends very specifically anymore. Maybe others can say better.

School starts in September so that might be helpful if you want the local kiddos to be otherwise occupied. 

If you want to pick more blackberries than you can eat, mid August is great. Blackberries grow there like you wouldn't believe along the road, in parks, everywhere. They make our mulberries look like a joke.

There are very few deciduous trees other than oaks so don't expect a big color show in the northern part of the state when the season starts to change.

Also also, we got a combined total of 3 mosquito bites in two weeks and never once used bug spray.

"As a native Oregonian, I'd recommend Newport. There's a lot more to do there than in many Oregon coast towns, which are frequently tiny and economically depressed to varying degrees. There's the Oregon Coast Aquarium, the Bay Front, the Art Deco District and Nye Beach. It has multuple commercial areas and a functioning fishery (There's a Deadliest Catch series based out of Newport even). 

Lincoln City is super touristy and about 20 miles north of Newport, so you could stay in either Lincoln City or Newport and have access to sandy beaches galore, many parks and lots of activities. I.prefer Newport but I think Lincoln City has more vacation homes and hotels than Newport does and it's an easy drive between the two . The entire coast is pretty much gorgeous, but if you want to do sight seeing or shopping or fun activities that aren't nature centered, Newport is a good option. And as an FYI, you will need a car on the coast. Public transport is almost nonexistent.

"My vote, as an Oregonian who used to live on the coast and who is aiming to move back when he can‚Ä¶ plan your trip between Florence and Astoria.  Start at one end and travel toward the other.

You get a literal metric ton of the most beautiful drive through Heceta Head, Cape Perpetua, and towns like Yachats and Depot Bay that are every bit as coastal and cozy as any cape cod cottage, and in my opinion the best breweries in Oregon are all on the coast, several of which you can hit up within this stretch.

"Deane‚Äôs Oceanfront Lodge in Yachats is probably on the south end of what you are looking for, but still less than 3 hours from Portland.

It was our dog‚Äôs happy place. The rooms are small, but you can get small kitchenettes. Walk out the back door and down the stairs to some of the biggest and longest sandy beaches in Oregon. Also tend not to be nearly as crowded as the beaches to the north.

10 years ago you could stay there for less than $60 a night. It‚Äôs much more expensive now, but probably still cheaper than many other options.

"Hey my dad's ashes are there.    

Before he died he gave me a cassette tape that he said he wanted me to play while I was flinging his remains into the boiling sea.  On the tape was written ""Kansas--Dust In The Wind"" in his shaky handwriting.  

So a few months later he meets his maker and I trudge out there with my sister and a boom box.  No wind that day--miraculously--but the surf was splashing over the rocks in high tide.  

A solemn affair:  My sister and I dressed in our best clothes, Mom safe in the car, too upset to join us.  

I open up the coffee can and start to pour his ashes into the ocean as my sister pushes play on the tape deck with the volume as high as it will go.

"We look at several things, including (partial list): do the park features justify it, are there nearby opportunities that don't charge for parking, is it feasible based on the number of parking areas and entrances, is it allowed according to the property deed or other legal restrictions, what would the public reaction be, are there management reasons (like congestion control) for it. This last reason was more compelling when the parking fees first began around 30 years ago and $5 for a carload would persuade some people to seek another location. It would have to be a bit more than that to control the crowds now.

There are more than 60 state parks along the coast. Only seven of them charge for parking. None of them charge an entrance fee. A map of state parks that charge for parking is [online](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=visit.day-us).

"Really? I've felt it's been rather mild compared to last year as there were multiple power outages. 

I'm guessing southern Oregon coast? Bandon and Port Orford almost always gets 80 mph wind gusts. Like I haven't seen nearly the amount of downed trees on hikes like Humbug or read about 101 closed due to any land slides. (If you've driven south of Port Orford or through the redwoods, 101 is always getting hammered)

Also, 15 years would be nearly 2006 when you had the freak wind storm with 130 MPH gusts that ravaged the coast line and hit in the 80 mph gusts in the willamette valley. I'd never seen trees on houses and cars smashed by trees in the valley but that happened. Absolutely nothing like that has happened in a long time.
