- “get off”, as in “are you going to get off the car?” which translates to getting “out” of the car.

When I mentioned it, the server looked at the order and said, “And that’s because the guy checked the order too.” I find this usage quite confusing and took me awhile to understand.

"I didn't say it didn't have, I said Brownsville has more.. for the simple reason that it's easier to convince one government than five, same goes for everything else.

I'm not an urban planner, but I had the chance to travel all over the world, and being that I love bikes (pedal and motor ones) I get to know cities in different ways than just as a tourist.

I find urbanism fascinating, I glow with envy when I'm in a European properly built city, where cars are just another way of transport and not the only one. I was in Singapore for a few months and the only cars I used were the taxis to and from the airport, everywhere else I walked, used bus or subways. It's heaven.

Getting back to the Valley is painful, riding bikes on the street is suicidal, public transport is a joke, and walking is just a fantasy, most of our cities don't even have sidewalks.

Arguing about which of our cities has ""better urbanization"" is a cruel joke, we are like at the bottom of the barrel.. but hey, we have great tacos :)",t2_13i4mp,Ducatista_MX,0,1648754447.0,0,t1_i2vx8f6,i2vx8f6,False,furtissim,t3_ts31x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/ts31x7/edinburgmcallen_or_brownsville_for_living/,Edinburg/McAllen or Brownsville for living,/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/ts31x7/edinburgmcallen_or_brownsville_for_living/i2vx8f6/,1,r/RioGrandeValley,0,1
"The cost of living in the valley is pretty much as low as you can get in the US lol  
If you don't have children you are living extremely comfortably with a household income of 100k or more.   
With 250k or more that means a luxury home plus two luxury cars in the driveway (assuming you're into that) still putting away a responsible amount toward savings/retirement, and having plenty leftover to play with each month.   


In terms of living in the super in demand neighborhoods it doesn't take nearly as much as might in other areas. You can probably qualify for a mortgage for one of the lower priced homes in that area with 100k household income. But I would say in order for it to be a sound financial decision then household income should probably be closer to 200k. But there are other houses within a quarter mile that are slightly more affordable but I would still consider it North McAllen.

">So urban sprawl would be the spreading of urban developments on undeveloped land near a city **irregularly or without restraint**.

I pasted here verbatim the definition of urban sprawl, why do you need to modify it? because you are wrong, that's why.. check this other one, from encyclopedia Britannica:

*Urban sprawl, also called sprawl or suburban sprawl, the rapid expansion of the geographic extent of cities and towns, often characterized by low-density residential housing, single-use zoning, and increased reliance on the private automobile for transportation.*

You see? you are confusing the general meaning of the word ""sprawl"" with the common definition of ""urban sprawl"", is not the same thing.. As an ""urban planner"" you should know that.

&#x200B;

>I like how you used the a bad example of density to argue against it.

I'm not arguing against urban density, I'm showing you how urban density does not correlate to urbanization. Matamoros and Reynosa are way more dense than McAllen or Brownsville, but no one in their right mind will call them ""better urbanized"".

&#x200B;

>My main point was in response to your initial comment that Brownsville had ""long term policies for better urbanization"". I simply disagree with that.

Sure, but you did not offer any argument to support that disagreement. You just said that McAllen is more dense and therefore better urbanized, that's clearly faulty logic. Also, you cited McAllen density while ignoring McAllen metropolitan area.. that just shows ignorance of the basic composition of the cities in the Valley, maybe because you are new here.

&#x200B;

Now, my point was very simple. One municipality can plan ahead better than a metropolitan area composed of several municipalities. If you disagree with that, you have zero idea how public administration works.. riddle me this: why Brownsville has better bike infrastructure than McAllen Metropolitan Area, if as you said McAllen is more dense?

"Ok so I’ve lived in Brownsville for 10 years and Mcallen for 5 and worked as a teacher. 

Brownsville pros: 
-closer to the beach and easier to make a day trip and back. 
-if you live by Alton gloor area on the north side, you are zoned to los Fresnos isd and that’s a great district based on academics and athletics. 
-There are more things to do for children such as the zoo or children’s museum. 
-less traffic. 

Cons: 
-for adults all there is are a few bars to visit. 
-only food to eat is Mexican food or local chains. But the Mexican food is really great. 

Mcallen 
Pros
- more diversity in food choices because there is a little more diverse culture. Way more high end restaurant choices
-schools in Mcallen isd are great as well. 
-more activities to do for adults such as bars and entertainment. 
-more events are hosted in the Mcallen area or concerts in Hidalgo which is close by. 

Cons 
-the housing market is probably a lot more competitive and higher than Brownsville. You could probably get more house and yard in Brownsville.

"I lived in Edinburg my entire life, but have been living in Brownsville for the past two years. I came to Brownsville a handful of times growing up (only the zoo) but go to Mcallen/Edinburg every other weekend since I’ve moved. 
Brownsville is definitely more “authentic” but not as diverse as McAllen/Edinburg. You really won’t find much more than Mexican food down here and although things are changing with the city growth, I don’t think it will ever catch up to McAllen. 
In Mcallen, you can find Arabic food, Indian food, PLENTY of asian restaurants (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Philippine), Peruvian food, etc the list goes on. Brownsville has:
- 3 sushi options (one which i’ve heard terrible reviews of, and one which closes at extremely early  hours) 
- 1 ramen shop
- 1 good pizza place 
- 1 Mediterranean/Tex-Mex restaurant 

Additionally, the metropolitan area is so much bigger in McAllen. Need something in Mission? less than a 20 min drive.  Need something from Pharr? around the corner. Brownsville is pretty isolated from the rest of the RGV, even Harlingen is a 30 minute drive!

"I feel like the McAllen/Edinburg area is probably the most developed as far as having places to eat, etc. 

Brownsville is cool, but definitely lacks the variety of McAllen. Good thing is, depending on what part of Brownsville you live in, you’re 15-30 minutes away from either of the two choices for going to the beach: Boca Chica beach and South Padre.

That said, if you’re looking for a small-town vibe, there are surround cities that may be more to your taste, but still close enough to enjoy the dining and shopping that McAllen has to offer.

Unfortunately, you’re a good hour or so away from the beach.

Additionally, there are a few other cities that aren’t as well-known:

I’m not the biggest fan of Harlingen, but I will say it is in a very centralized part of the valley as is San Benito, which gives you the small town life combined with being very central to the rest of the valley.

Port Isabel is a badass little town because the island is less than 10 minutes away, which means lots of food and the beach. The only problem is that it’s kind of isolated: 20-30 minutes from Brownsville and maybe 60-70 minutes from McAllen.",t2_d1sa0,WorldBelongsToUs,0,1648690363.0,0,t1_i2sk5k5,i2sk5k5,True,furtissim,t3_ts31x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/ts31x7/edinburgmcallen_or_brownsville_for_living/,Edinburg/McAllen or Brownsville for living,/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/ts31x7/edinburgmcallen_or_brownsville_for_living/i2sk5k5/,2,r/RioGrandeValley,0,2

"Did you miss the initial definition of sprawl in that same website?
*to spread or develop irregularly or without restraint*
So urban sprawl would be *the spreading of urban developments on undeveloped land near a city* **irregularly or without restraint**. There's a reason urban sprawl has a negative connotation. It's not sustainable and unrestrained sprawl tends to increase infrastructure costs which then leads to higher local taxes for the maintenance of that infrastructure.

It's funny, all those cities you mentioned are also denser than Brownsville [see here] (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/pharrcitytexas,missioncitytexas,edinburgcitytexas,brownsvillecitytexas,mcallencitytexas/PST045221)

I don't think you fully understand the actual city limits of Brownsville. Compare for yourself [here] (https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=a21dc22ec10c4ccb96923ab55170e530). You'll notice there is a ton of empty space within Brownsville city limits.

I like how you used the a bad example of density to argue against it. Would I live in Kowloon? No, but I have lived in downtown Los Angeles (Koreatown to be exact), downtown Houston, and would totally live in San Francisco, NYC, or Chicago.

I understand there are many metrics to show good urbanization including those you mentioned, but my main point was in response to your initial comment that Brownsville had ""long term policies for better urbanization"".

"Welcome to the Rio Grande Valley! This area is both ecologically rich and a unique area. If you enjoy nature, it truly is one of a kind. We have a migratory air highway of birds traveling from all over the world and have amazing birding centers where you get to observe it.

The hawk season is happening right now and it’s awesome to watch at the Bentsen State Park.

We also have our other parks and wild life refugees.

As far as food, the food is great every where you go. But you will find a diversity (not like New York diversity- but the eateries are diverse compared to what it used to be in the past) of eateries in McAllen I find.

Brownsville is beautiful but too far and seems too separate from the rest of the valley.
Yes, the beach is there but depending if you decide to live near Brownsville UTRGV, the beach is about an hour away still.

If you live in the edinburg McAllen area, you have a quicker route for traveling to San Antonio (3.5 drive depending), Austin (5hr), Houston or Galveston (6hrs) and so many other cool towns. 

I warn you that our roads are made with asphalt so expect to get a crack on your car windows. It’s a common and annoying occurrence.

I think it depends on what you’re looking for down here. I personally would pick McAllen/Edinburg area because there is more to do IMO.

There’s more comic book stores, when we hold our big conventions (like anime con) it’s at McAllen. Lots of our big concerts are in Edinburg at the Burt Ogden Arena.

">Sprawl is sprawl and sprawl is bad urbanization.

Sprawl is just city growth, from Merriam Webster:

*Definition of urban sprawl : the spreading of urban developments (such as houses and shopping centers) on undeveloped land near a city.*

A city growing is not necessarily a bad thing, it's usually the opposite.

&#x200B;

>McAllen’s density is 2,283 people/ square mile Brownsville’s density is 1,420 people/square mile

You are equivocating McAllen with its metropolitan area.. once you include Edinburg/Mission/Pharr (as OP and everyone in the Valley does) you'll find plenty of empty space. When people complain about ""McAllen traffic"", they are referring to traffic in all that area, not just on streets technically in McAllen.

And again, just go and check google maps, there's enough free space between Edinburg and McAllen to fit San Juan and Alamo.. 

&#x200B;

>So, as an urban planner, I’m telling you McAllen and that area in general is better urbanized.

"The fact Brownsville has “a continuous sprawl” disproves your very point. Sprawl is sprawl and sprawl is bad urbanization. 

McAllen’s density is 2,686 people/ square mile
Brownsville’s density is 1,322 people/square mile

So, as an urban planner, I’m telling you McAllen and that area in general is better urbanized.

"It's all ""mexicany"" and there's pretty much a border crossing 15 to 30m away anywhere in the valley. McAllen is like a second home to me and I truly wish I'd lived there rather than a small town northeast. I've been to Brownsville and worked in Brownsville and while I can't point to anything specific, a ""chill vibe"" is putting it very mildly. It's more like a ""depressing vibe"" and I actually feel homesick after being there for any matter of time. 

Brownsville = Old/Sad/Stagnant 

McAllen = New/Vibrant/Flourishing 

I haven't had the pleasure of visiting SpaceX nor have I witnessed Elon cruising the mean streets of BTown but neither of those things seem like more than sparse novelties. And of course you can always visit the zoo/beach/SpaceX on your downtime. 

*I've never lived in Brownsville so I can't speak much towards the community, schools or amenities but I'm willing to bet most people would find it strikingly boring in comparison to the McAllen metropolitan area. Only reason I'd consider Brownsville is if I had a very high paying job there, so high that it'd make up for the toll it would take on my mental state. 

All this to say that I'm actually not much of a fan of the valley myself and this is mostly attributed to the weather(brown town is noticeably muggier). I've always wanted to move to a cooler climate,  perhaps because I was born in Connecticut. But personally, I got Colorado Springs in my crosshairs. But even then I'm sure I'll miss the valley for the rich culture, proximity to Mexico and of course, family.

"No problem. 

It really depends on your budget. If you are a high income household then North McAllen is where it's at. That's some of the most expensive real estate per square foot that's south of San Antonio. No area in Brownsville even comes close. But for good reason. That area has absolutely everything.   
You can live in the bougie area of Mission and still find decent deals right now (decent as in relative to the crazy market right now, not cheap ha.) That area is referred to as Sharyland. That's the second most in demand area. 

If you're planning on raising a family, Sharyland and McAllen ISD schools tend to have the highest test scores and produce the most graduates who go on to Ivy Leagues. That's one of the factors driving up the housing prices in those areas.   


Stick to Mcallen, west mission, south edinburg. Don't live east of 281 and don't go south of Expressway 83 unless it's in Sharyland Plantation area. 

Some people will try to tell you there are great deals in Pharr but because of the way they zone things you might be living in a really nice house but you'll have a trailer park on one side, a house with loud roosters and donkeys on another, and the ghetto only a block away. There isn't a lot of violent crime anywhere down here but Pharr has a lot of non violent property crime for a reason.   


If you do decide on Brownsville I have no idea what areas you need to stick to.

"They each have pros and cons but the McAllen/Edinburg area easily surpasses Brownsville by most metrics as follows.

1. Significantly better infrastructure and general development 

2. More restaurants and importantly, VARIETY of restaurants. Brownsville overall I'd say has better Mexican food but the upper valley has way more variety. 

3. Cheaper housing. Brownsville used to have cheaper housing until it started to be gentrified by SpaceX, something which is certain to worsen. 

4. Diversity. To put it quite frankly, the valley is almost entirely populated by small minded mexican-americans that have a narrow worldview, many of which have never left Texas or even th3 valley. The upper valley actually has a good amount of people living here from other countries (not just mexico) or from other parts of the country. Most valley people get shocked whenever they see a white, black or Asian person so in general expect a lot of ignorance, but there is definitely less so in the upper valley. 

5. Entertainment. From shopping to the aforementioned restaurants to natural areas, the upper valley just has more to offer. Brownsville by itself does have more natural areas and without a doubt is more historic than the upper valley, however the upper valley overall has way more i.e. salt lakes, several national wildlife refuges, 2 state parks, 5 world birding centers and more parks in general. 

Brownsville definitely gets major points for being close to the beach and as mentioned, has way more historic sites i.e Palo also national historic battlefield (site of the first battle of the mexican-american war), palmito ranch (site of the final battle of the U.S civil war, several natural areas, a state park, sabal palm sanctuary and beaches. SpaceX also has its manufacturing and launch center near boca chica Beach which is a pro and a con in itself. Easy access to South padre Island and the coast in general and a smaller town feel, the Gladys Porter zoo is also located here which is amazing. 

I live in Edinburg but work in Brownsville and can say that Brownsville and the lower valley in general is lovely to visit but not the live. You're going to deal with a lot more ignorance, less variety in culture/food and a local economy that's increasingly being owned by Elon Musk. That's my two cents, I've lived in the valley for nearly 6 years and it's definitely not even close to being the best area to live in Texas but it's also not the worst.

"I think people who have lived here their whole lives are really splitting hairs to try and make the two areas seem different. They're not.

Housing prices are similar. Culture is identical. There isn't a huge difference in humidity. The valley is very humid period. 

McAllen area has more to do and is growing at a faster rate. Edinburg adds several thousands of houses per year while Brownsville adds a few hundred. 

Brownsville is closer to the beach. The flooding might get worse during hurricane season, but not always. 

That's it. Those are the real differences.

My advice would be figure out where you think you'll be socializing more, even if it doesn't mean partying. If you end up making more friends in the McAllen area because that's where you attend events, you're going to wish you were living there, or vice versa. Most people down here will not make that drive regularly in order to spend time with you if they have other friends nearby. 

Definitely don't listen to the ones suggesting the oddball towns/cities like Harlingen, Weslaco, etc. McAllen metro area and Brownsville metro area are the only two reasonable options down here.

"Since you have kids you should base your decision more off of the schools in the area. Brownsville has an older vibe it’s definitely a nice place to live in the valley. Someone described it is more authentic, I don’t think that’s true but it definitely feels older, with SpaceX the cracks are showing in terms of city infrastructure, and just the general preparedness for what’s going to happen to the area. McAllen is an evolving city and growing quickly. in general the valley is a good place to grow up but the school quality varies wildly. A lot of an inequity in that department.

You will find in the valley that there is hardly any public transportation so remember that your life is going to be carbased, although every school district provides great buses to get kids to and from school. You’re going to be dealing with extraordinary heat and humidity that not everyone is prepared for it but you’ll adapt quickly.

No matter what you hear on the news the valley is an extraordinarily safe place to live. All this talk of drug cartels and things are generally over exaggerated. They tend to just deal with each other and with law-enforcement there’s no spillover into the general public. 

I grew up in the valley, I love the valley, I live elsewhere now, being in my mid-20s I still want a little more than what I feel the valley has to offer in terms of culture diversity and exposure. I’m also uncomfortable with how quickly it is growing. I feel like it’s growing too quickly for it’s own good and there are going to be challenges in the next few decades that a lot of the communities aren’t prepared to deal with. 

 I have always felt that the valley is a fantastic place to raise a family, and if I decide to I will probably go back. Lots of rich family values in the area.

"Team Brownsville here.. to add on what has already been said, let me put my two cents:

The McAllen metropolitan area is actually few towns that grew together: McAllen, Edinburg, Phar, Mission (maybe Hidalgo too). This means a lot of diversity in services, infrastructure and city planning. Each have their own police, townhalls, etc..

In contrast, Brownsville is just one city with a few close by towns (like Los Fresnos or Olmito). This has been of great advantage to promote long term policies for better urbanization.

If you have a chance to come to the Valley before making the decision, that would be the best approach.. visit both places and see if you can catch the differences. Honestly, for an outsider all the Valley will look the same.

"Brownsville for sure. McAllen is overwhelming with traffic, car accidents, etc. 

-Brownsville has a slower pace of life, more authenticity, and more affordable cost of living… though it’s been growing. People have more of a humble nature. I’d also say, there are new local leaders who have revamped the place and done a lot of good to improve travel, resources, quality of life, etc. The current Mayor is also really accessible and great at listening to the people. Elon Musk lives there now - it’s his primary residence. He drives his Tesla around and I think it’s easier for him because it’s such a laid back place and most Mexican nationals who live and work in Brownsville have no idea who he is.

-McAllen has more chain stores (Brownsville has some too, but McAllen more so). One would either go to McAllen or Mercedes to buy certain types of clothing, for example. It’s also more stressful because there’s a ridiculous amount of traffic and with lacking infrastructure, everything is constantly under construction… has been for years, which makes any day in McAllen incredibly stressful. All the cities around McAllen are completely connected, which makes travel even more congested. McAllen is also more of the party scene with more of the large concerts nearby. Many Mexican celebrities live in the McAllen area.

-Harlingen is basically a bunch of old white people and doctors/stores/resources for those old white people. I would not recommend. …unless you are white and deliberately want to stay in an insulated bubble. Not a ton to offer other than being in the middle of the RGV (making both of the larger cities more accessible, since you are in the middle).

"Welcome! I'm sure y'all will love it here. Regardless of what part of the RGV you choose to settle, you will have quick access to travel, multiple food options, and affordable living.

McAllen/Edinburg: Because this is where more of the development has taken place over the past couple of decades, there are ample varieties for food (both in terms of cuisine and mix of national/local joins), and shopping (mostly recognizable brands, but plenty of local stores, too). Likewise, there are multiple options for professional sports (Vipers and Toros), concert venues, museums, and movie theaters. Two locations for the big chain book store, the only ones in the Valley.

But because much of the development is from external influence, this area can look like any other part of the country: a lot of your view is pavement, traffic lights, and chain stores. The rush hour traffic w/i the cities can render the closeness of everything kind of moot—what's the point of living ""close"" to something if it's going to take you just as long to get there? It's nice that there are so many quality movie theaters, but what's it matter if they're all showing the same blockbusters and offering the same amenities? M/E are closer to leaving the Valley (you'll get used to driving to visit San Antonio, Austin, Houston) but that's really only a quantitative advantage if you live close to the expressway.

Brownsville: More of a unique, local look and vibe, with the built environment reflecting the regional natural landscape. Recent developments, especially downtown, have been pushed by local groups, which means that the existing communities have a say in the changes. However, there is tension lately with big-money private and political interests pushing a more gentrified vision. What you heard about the mugginess is absolutely true, but I'm yet to encounter anyone in the Valley who gives other people a hard time for having to deal with the heat.

BVille is closer to South Padre Island. Folks in M/E like to say SPI is ""an hour a way,"" but that's only true if you don't start counting the drive until you get out of McAllen and stop the clock once you get to Port Isabel. It is not, in any honest interpretation, 60 minutes from your house in McAllen to your beach chair (and depending on the time of year/week/day, you could spend close to an hour just sitting in traffic waiting to get over the causeway).

"Screw it, I’m not doing much, I’ll offer some insight.

First & foremost, I should say that the valley can be what you make it. Im from McAllen & personally love the area, and miss it dearly whenever I leave on month(s) long work trips. I’m a petroleum engineer so I’m always getting flown out, and almost always feel homesick as soon as I’m a few days away from the valley, which speaks volume as to how ‘home-y’ the place really is. It’s very unique, and offers everyone a great way of life. People in the younger generations deem it ‘boring’ because it’s lacking city like infrastructure that significantly bigger Texas cities like San Antonio, Houston, Austin, etc have but honestly the place is great. Over the last decade the McAllen/Edinburg area has really expanded and has built a lot of modern recreational arenas, parks, restaurants, shopping centers and bar districts. we actually have a top golf now too that was made made 2-3 years ago. Our main shopping mall was also remodeled and is very nice to visit, and that’s coming from someone that always hated going there cause I hate being around too many people. I get anxious. I’ve lived in Houston, and while houston was definitely an amazing city to live in, I’d choose the valley to settle in but that’s just me. Even with the housing market inflation prices the cost of living is significantly cheaper than other Texas cities, and you could live like a king/queen with a nice, big home (if that’s your thing) compared to what you’d get in other cities for the same price. I’d say the Crime rate is also significantly less than most Texas cities. Sure it’s not a perfect place, but most crimes committed are minor, it’s usually big news for the area whenever something significant happens. In Houston you pretty much had to accept that your car was gonna get broken into at one point. I could go on & on but overall the valley offers everyone a slow paced, comfortable & cheap way of living while immersed in a great Mexican/Hispanic culture.

Pros: 
•it’s the ‘metropolitan’ area of the valley, with a great selection of recreational options like parks, arenas, bars, restaurants, shopping centers etc 
•it’s all compact & connected, and you often times don’t have to travel far to get to where you want to go
•homes & neighborhoods are nice & cheap 
•just way more to do & enjoy on your own leisure 

Cons: 
• almost everyone in the average family has to have a car, car pooling is almost none existent in valley families, so as a result traffic has increased significantly & is really only bad early in the morning 7-9am when people are going to work and from 4:30-7:30pm whenever people are going home from work. 
•the city is currently tuning up & upgrading their highway systems so there’s a bit of construction that only amplifies how bad traffic can get. In the short term, it’s a pain in the ass but long term it’ll be a great thing.
• honestly I can’t really name another con that I could think of right now 

Brownville: 
Pros: 
•a zoo? 
•Elon Musk’s Space X Star Base (which is actually pretty fuckin cool but it’s pretty much waaaay out of way and closer to the beach than it is closer to Brownsville)

Cons: 
•tbh brownville looks like a hell hole, no offense to it’s residents. In my 26 years of living all I’ve ever known brownville as was a pass through town to get to the beach. It also doesn’t look very pleasing to live in from the times I’ve passed through it. Infact I’m just gonna stop here cause I don’t know much about brownville since I’ve never really taken time out of my day to go there just for leisure. If someone wants to add pros/cons for Brownsville they’re welcome to.

Just like the south used to be democrat and now its republican despite the views being the same. All that changed was the “party” name.

"Of course, homie! Thank you. It's true. The ways the history of the United States affects us to this day is very real and I think given our geographical location, isolated in the tip-toe of Texas, our poor (arguably colonial) public education, our longing to ""be more American"", and our machista tendencies for pride, denial, and ""toughen up and get over it"" mentality, our history has been forgotten, undervalued, or straight up erased, which has all  set us up to be obsequious to conservative/law & order/patriotic culture.

And perhaps it's too deep for this post, but even beyond the centuries-old narrative of ""US/Texas Oppressing Mexicans"" that you've pointed out, almost all of us descend (very visibly) from natives who, at some point, were detribalized into ""Hispanic/Mestizo/Catholic"" identity and severed our ties with the nations and cultures of our ancestors who have been on this continent for thousands and thousands of years. One of the things in my life that really brought me back to studying the Valley in a serious way has been traveling through Latin America & meeting/talking  to Natives in the US and realizing we are all cousins, much more similar than we think, who have been affected by colonialism in different ways...but that's for another time!",t2_49416ub6,jasperpablo,0,1648488810.0,0,t1_i2gncds,i2gncds,False,jasperpablo,t3_tpqy1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tpqy1c/re_last_weeks_posts_about_valley_conspiracy/,"Re: last week's posts about Valley ""conspiracy theories"" & the KKK in San Benito photo",/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tpqy1c/re_last_weeks_posts_about_valley_conspiracy/i2gncds/,6,r/RioGrandeValley,0,6

"These points are not even worth engaging with, but considering how you're clearly very passionate about a tragically uninformed take, it might just be better to make an example.

Confederate statues, in many cases, have been transported to museums where ""history"", as you point out, is preserved and [observed](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/these-confederate-statues-were-removed-where-did-they-go-n1240268). There is no legitimate argument for having statues of genocidal, slave-owning, pro-segregation figures, confederate or not, in public spaces where families should be able to picnic, walk their dogs, hang out and build community. If people are really interested in history, they can go to the museum and learn about it with context.

It's embarrassing to have to explain this, but you're either under-read or being disingenuous, so: Yes! The Democrats were pro-slavery in the mid 19th century. Very informed of you! An incredibly empty point that disregards 150+ years of changes in party platforms and national history, but I guess you can get one point for participation.

"There’s a TX veterans war memorial in McAllen which is really neat. Resembles some DC monuments (on a smaller scale). 

Ive also been to the Brownsville History museum on Elizabeth or Washington Ave.  You can spend about an hour there. 

Ive never visited, but the Palo Alto battlefields look cool. I think there’s just open Fields with cannons still standing. 

You could visit La Sal Del Rey near McAllen. King of Spain used to mine salt there and it’s a nice walking trail that leads to shallow, very clear, very salty water. 

The Sabel Palm Sanctuary is also an old farm house you can tour. Will only take 15 minutes but there’s also nice walking trails all around it.

"You're making the argument about removing statues not teaching history. You can have history being taught without having statues erected. How do we know about the Nazis and yet we don't have any monuments to them? Auschwitz doesn't have a plaque honoring the heroes of the war from the Daughters of the 3rd Reich. 

Yeah sure the Democrats wanted to keep slavery in the 1800s but if you actually followed your advice and did some research into history you would see that there was a switch in the 1960s when Civil Rights Act was being passed and the parties switched. Southern Democrats became Republicans overnight. You're being obtuse just to fit a narrative you want to convey.

"**[La Matanza (1910–1920)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Matanza_\(1910–1920\))** 
 
 >La Matanza (""The Massacre"" or ""The Slaughter"") and the Hora de Sangre (""Hour of Blood"") was a period of anti-Mexican violence in Texas, including lynchings and massacres, between 1910 and 1920 in the midst of tensions between the United States and Mexico during the Mexican Revolution. This violence was  committed by Anglo-Texan vigilantes, and law enforcement, such as the Texas Rangers, during operations against bandit raids known as the Bandit Wars. The violence and denial of civil liberties during this period was justified by racism.

*The Injustice Never Leaves You: Anti-Mexican Violence in Texas* by Monica Muñoz Martinez

*Reverberations of Racial Violence: Critical Reflections on the History of the Border* edited by Sonia Hernandez and Juan Moran Gonzalez

Also I am currently reading a book about political corruption in the RGV in the early 1900s called *Boss Rule in South Texas: The Progressive Era*.

I've also wondered the same thing—but I guess considering that the RGV has grown substantially in the last 15 years, I assume that elite Texan families would see the trend coming years ahead and investing in masses of real estate to accommodate for this coming boom would be a guaranteed successful investment. I mean, given that all the subdivisions have these generic and romantic Spanish names (El Jardín, Los Nogales, etc), they were pitching a Valley version of the American Suburb to Hispanics wanting to live in a ""nice"" area, and people from up north wanting to live in a suburb with ""flair"".

"It's really very long and detailed but I'll give a short summary about the development's background. All of this is easy to verify through google. You could go to the Sharyland Plantation website and click on ""Developer"" on the right hand side and go down the rabbithole for yourself! ([http://www.sharylandplantation.com/about.aspx](http://www.sharylandplantation.com/about.aspx))

Sharyland Plantation was developed by Hunt Realty, the real estate subsidary of a Dallas-based multinational oil company called Hunt Oil. In other words, SP was a tiny side-hustle in the portfolio of a massive international oil corp.

Hunt Oil, as you can find for yourself with a few google searches, has drilled all over the world since the 20th century and they currently have a huge stake in an Amazon rainforest drilling project which has gained the UN's attention for its destruction of environment and ancestral lands.

The owners of this company, the Hunt family, are a billionaire family whose patriarch, H.L. Hunt, was once the richest man in the world, believed he was immortal, actively bankrolled white supremacist orgs, and is speculated, in some theories, to have been involved in the JFK assassination, but I won't vouch for that, personally ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\_L.\_Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Hunt)). He had over a dozen kids who went on to become ambassadors, oil lords, one  \*founded the Super Bowl\*, etc. Again, none of this is secret and is all very google-able.

So, in short, SP is just a tiny side-hustle of a very powerful mega-billionaire oil family from Dallas whose patriarch had documented links to white supremacist orgs & politicians like George Wallace - if you click the link, just ctrl+f ""Hunt"" ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George\_Wallace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace)).",t2_49416ub6,jasperpablo,0,1648415625.0,0,t1_i2cz5n3,i2cz5n3,False,jasperpablo,t3_tpqy1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tpqy1c/re_last_weeks_posts_about_valley_conspiracy/,"Re: last week's posts about Valley ""conspiracy theories"" & the KKK in San Benito photo",/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tpqy1c/re_last_weeks_posts_about_valley_conspiracy/i2cz5n3/,23,r/RioGrandeValley,0,23

"The wikis linked above and their respective references are, of course, great starting points, but there are a ton of great books written on the topics.

For me, *Blood Oranges* by Timothy Paul Bowman is the best as it covers a general history of the RGV, beginning with the first written records by Spanish ""explorers"", an overview of how the ""Valley"" was essentially a marketing term to rename this floodplain and attract white farmers, and then goes all the way to the RGV in the late 20th century.

He makes a very credible argument that the ""Valley"" and its people were colonized very much how Natives were colonized in other parts of North America and he has a ton of primary sources to make the case (diary entries of an evangelical colonist who started a school to ""save the souls"" of Mexicans, letters between farmers discussing how the locals are ""basically Indians"" and are willing to work for wages unheard of in other parts of the country).

There are more books written about La Matanza/Plan de San Diego, though I can't recommend one in particular. Mostly, though, I would say that any reading about Native Americans and the ways they have been colonized through the course of US history is \*very\* relevant to understanding the RGV—while internally we may not identify as natives in the same way and we may not be connected to our ancestral cultures, Mex-Americans in the RGV were seen as being an obstacle to expansion and commerce and through mob violence, land theft, labor exploitation and correctional schooling, they could be subdued—much like natives have been in other parts of the country.",t2_49416ub6,jasperpablo,0,1648413235.0,0,t1_i2ctzc8,i2ctzc8,False,jasperpablo,t3_tpqy1c,https://www.reddit.com/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tpqy1c/re_last_weeks_posts_about_valley_conspiracy/,"Re: last week's posts about Valley ""conspiracy theories"" & the KKK in San Benito photo",/r/RioGrandeValley/comments/tpqy1c/re_last_weeks_posts_about_valley_conspiracy/i2ctzc8/,28,r/RioGrandeValley,0,28
