"There are very few places left that aren't overrun with tourists.  As much as visitors are welcome and we absolutely depend on their revenue, sometimes it gets frustrating to live in a place where it feels like a constant train of people come, make a mess, and then leave.  When we are trying to get to work, or drop off our kids at school the ONE ROAD we have is plugged up with new york license plates.  You would be amazed at how many angry mean people are on their vacation.  Honking, yelling, fighting their way to KW.

Locals like to eat normal food.  Steak and potato.  We like to drink a cold beer, instead of a tropical fruit salad with an umbrella on top.  If a place has an ""award winning fish sandwich"" or ""world famous key lime pie"" we don't care.  We don't like mango and coconut put on every damned piece of food or drink.  We aren't on vacation.

If there are some off the beaten path places where locals hang, they have really started to keep them to themselves.

"I don’t mean to bring more worry to you but they sound like German roaches. And they are insidious. There’s a good possibility they could hitch a ride in your luggage etc and then infest your own home. They are also very bad for your health, for example they can trigger long term respiratory issues. No super short term solution exists to my knowledge but I did clear an infestation brought into my home by guests before. Kill every one you see. Ensure zero food sources are available. And pour a line of borax powder along every edge of every surface and sprinkle some in cabinets or wherever else you see them.

"At any given time, roughly 30% of homes in southern Florida are battling roaches. It’s a never-ending battle to keep them out of the house literally *all the time*. 

It’s really odd the place you’re renting isn’t on top of their game more. Every house most likely has a roach or two in it, but you have to constantly do a combo of cleaning up any possible food crumbs, plugging potential entries from outside, and regularly using exterminators/pesticides to keep them out.

I would guess past guests may have left food out or not cleaned up after themselves well, and it doesn’t take long in the Florida warmth for an insect situation to get out of control.

My advice is to go on google and look for all Realty Firms around your area and then expand further and look which one provides long term rentals.

"My fiancé and I moved to Marathon a little over a year ago. We work from home in finance, not in the service/boating industry so my perspective is slightly different. 

I don’t own a boat it live in a decent size apartment in a neighborhood with a pool and “beach” (we got stupid lucky). 

Because I work from home I don’t have to experience a ton of the bad traffic, etc. The problems people mentioned about crowded grocery stores is a non-issue here. It does get crowded but rarely is Publix out of stock and the lines arnt worse than a populated city. 

Id say the biggest downside is lack of things to do besides water activities. I love walking on the beach, kayaking, etc. You can’t do that all day every day. And a lot of the other options are expensive (like diving, driving to Key West for the day, etc) or always involve drinking. 

I’m also younger (29), and there are ZERO young people here (this may be a marathon thing and is different in Key West and maybe Key Largo). It’s been really challenging making friends, and those that we have made aren’t in the same position as us. They’re either older (or much older) with kids, or work in service industry and arnt in the same financial position as us and never have Sat/Sun off the way we do since we work a 9-5 Mon-Fri. So it’s rare we have plans with friends

Another thing to mention is the Salt. My car has probably aged 5 years in the past twelve months, and I can’t keep the rust of bikes or anything metal you keep outside. Just something to keep in mind.

"I posted this a few years ago.  

I lived in the Keys for 8 years.  Mostly in the upper Keys.  

The Florida Keys are absolutely beautiful.  The prettiest place I have ever lived.  

With that said, I am glad I moved.  Here's why.

The Keys are ridiculously expensive.  Housing is tops on the list.  A rental below $1,200 a month is not worth driving past.  Anything above that will be a tiny 1/1.  Prices scale up if the larger you go.  

A poster said buying a house on a dry lot will be $400k.  I would say that's not realistic unless you are looking to spend a lot of time and money fixing it up.  I would put it more at $500k to start.  A house on the water will start at $750k.  

If you own a home and you want to do anything besides paint it, good luck cutting through the red tape.  The amount of government and regulatory hoops you need to jump through to do anything is absurd.  Also absurdly expensive.  Want to fence in your back yard?  Likely you will need n environmental impact study done.  

Another poster mentioned paying tourist prices to eat out.  Yep.  Dinner for 2 with drinks can easily be $80.  

Virtually everything closes at 9p - 10p.  Aside from a couple of tourist bars, there is no night life there until you hit Key West.  Then you are paying tourist prices for drinks.  (At least they FINALLY got Uber!)  But if you want to just grab a burger at a fast food joint, be prepared to drive 20 miles round trip.  Gas, groceries and household stuff is also expensive.  The good thing is that an hour dive North in Florida City and Homestead is a 24 hour Walmart, a BJ's and a plenty of grocery stores.  It's well worth a monthly, hour drive North to stock up on basics and fill your car up.  

Another poster mentioned being a salty or an alcoholic.  Those seem to be the 2 paths that many local people are on down there.  Alcohol is rampant down there.  Getting drunk once in a while is fun when you are partying with your friends while on vacation.  But alcohol as a way of life will kill you.  If you like to drink, at least be smart are keep yourself stocked up.  Driving 10 miles to get more beer at one in the morning because you ran out is a sure way to get a DUI, or worse.  

I owned a boat.  I loved it.  But boat ownership is time consuming and expensive.  They say the 2 happiest days of a boat owner's life are the day he buys it and the day he sells it.  That was me.  I could afford it but it was a pain in the ass.  What I eventually did was sell that expensive money pit and befriended other people who owned boats.  Show up on time.  Bring food, bring bait, bring beer and drinks.  At least make the offer to buy the gas.  DON'T get sloppy drunk.  MOST important, when the trip is done stay after and thoroughly clean up, including cleaning the fish if you were fishing.  Do that and you will NEVER run out of days to go out on the water.  

There are so many people who retired to the keys so they could live out their dream of fishing and boating everyday.  The problem is there are not enough reliable, responsible people to go boating with so you got these people with expensive, beautiful boats who have no one to share it with.  They eventually get burned out from the time and the cost and get bored.  Generally they wind up have a $200k lawn ornament on the side of their house or on the sea wall.  

If ""SaltLife"" is your goal, put up cards at local marinas.  Offer food, bait and drinks in exchange for being on the water.  You will be contacted.  If you wind up with a Capt. Ahab or a drunk, just move on to the next one.  

Traffic can be an absolute nightmare sometimes.  You will learn how to do a ""Keys left"" to get on US-1 which is basically making a right and then a U-turn somewhere down the road.  Be prepared to drive 10mph under the speed limit because you are stuck behind a car from New Jersery diving slow so they can take in all the sights on their first visit to the Keys.  Be prepared for stop and crawl traffic because (something)-fest is going on that weekend in Key West.  Be prepared for some horrific car crash 10 miles away equaling you being stuck in your car for a couple of hours.  Be prepared to avoiding US-1 at all costs during certain hours at the start and end of holiday weekends.  

One other complaint I have not seen mentioned.  it seems like everyone has dogs.  It seems like no one trains them to not bark at all hours of the day and night.  Shit gets old after a while, especially if you want to walk around the neighborhood in the evening.  

I loved living there.  I still miss the water and the beauty.  But I don't miss living there anymore.  


EDIT:  It seems that for many people who live down there, they hate tourists and they hate taxes.  In my eyes, you can have one or the other.  Tourists tie up traffic and make it expensive to do things.  But they do pay for a lot of services and infrastructure that residents would otherwise pay for.  

Another thing I observed is that when many people move down there, they want to close US-1 behind them and be the last one moving down there.  When people who live down there complain about how growth and expansion harms the environment, my answer to them is bulldoze your house, plant mangroves and get out.  Funny how when put that way people suddenly become less environmental.",t2_5e3ue,TomTheNurse,0,1647813688.0,0,t1_i1gg46c,i1gg46c,True,repairman2428,t3_til1cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/til1cn/living_in_the_keys/,Living in the Keys,/r/floridakeys/comments/til1cn/living_in_the_keys/i1gg46c/,11,r/floridakeys,0,11

"Definitely more info needed. 
Flying into key west or into the mainland and driving down? 
Where are you staying in the keys?
This weekend is looking like a blow out for water activity so it will feel pretty busy on land, especially going out in the evening because all the people who make a living bringing tourists out on the water won’t be running. 
There lots of snorkeling; from key largo (pennecamp st park with Christ of the abyss) and all the reef spots between there and key west. Glass bottom boat tours are pretty cool when the water is cold. There’s not really any cliff jumping, there is one jumping bridge in the lower keys. Sombero beach in marathon is a really solid keys beach, the beaches here are not like Miami Beach or anything like that. Much smaller more private feel, no doubt they are busy on the weekends…especially when no one is out on the water.  If you don’t already have a boat or plane booked to go to the tortugas then most likely you’re too late, most of the inexpensive options are booked months in advance and if you go private…big $$
Anyways your route into the keys is important in the question because the drive in is awesome and there’s tons of shit to do along the way. Everything is gonna be filled with tourists we’re in spring break season. And still pretty heavily understaffed so best bet is to get on island time from the second you step on the plane. Things move slower here without staffing issues so patience is key! Over tip! Almost all the people here providing you any type of service, servers, bartenders, boat captains and mates, hotel staff, housekeeping, valet, the guy who bicycles you from one end of duval because it’s too far a walk back to the room🤣…the list goes on and on, these people rely on tips to be able to afford to live here and take care of (to the best of their ability) the every need of thousands of people 365 days a year.  It’s not cheap to come here and live here. The cheapest, livable house where I live in the middle keys is for sale for $700k 🙄So hook the people up who hook you up!

"Ok, I asked only to verify that you received an actual ticket. And because some formats of that ticket include a line where the officer can write how much the ticket will cost. It could also be on the back of the ticket. But, yours may not have that anywhere. In that case, you're supposed to contact the clerk of the county court, for the county where the violation occurred. I'm assuming Monroe County.

If the officer didn't cut you a break by writing you a ticket for a different offense, then the fine for violating the Move Over law starts $120 and goes up from there, plus points on your license. However, it looks to me like this won't transfer points to your CT license, though it will still be on your record.

Since you said ""trooper,"" I'm assuming you were pulled over by Florida Highway Patrol, rather than Monroe County Sheriff, is that correct? If it was the state patrol, it may take a few extra days for them to get all their tickets to the appropriate county courts. Verify that your ticket lists Monroe County as the courthouse to contact, and keep checking in with them. Once they have the record, they'll be able to tell you how much it will cost. If you're interested in fighting the ticket/trying to get it reduced, it may be possible to hire a lawyer who can represent you in court or work out a plea deal without you needing to be there, if you're heading home to CT before a possible court date.

FYI, in Florida if you're passing a stopped emergency vehicle, you're supposed to move over to leave an entire empty lane between you and the vehicle, AND slow down to 20mph below the speed limit. If moving over is not possible, you still need to slow to 20 below the limit. Every state has a Move Over law, but they're individual state laws and thus they vary. Familiarize yourself with the laws in the states you're traveling in, e.g. find out how exactly you're supposed to move, how much to slow down, and what vehicles you need to move over for.

"We went to the Everglades during summer years back. We were “prepared” with bug spray and proper clothing . We drove to a nice picnic area by the water , got out of the car and carried our cooler the 100 yards to a picnic table with a view . 

Then they attacked . 

First came the scout mosquito , to sample our valuable blood . Then we heard the sound of distant trumpets , and the dust cloud as the cavalry troops of Mosquito Battalion 2010 swooped down upon us from on high. 

Having lived in Georgia and Florida my whole life , Mosquito’s were not unknown to me . But the sheer volume in which they attacked , died from our slaps , and kept coming like tiny Hirohito Kamikaze pilots was simply astonishing to behold . 

We RAN back to our car as if we were being chased by lions , and peeled out of there never to return . 

The 50 mile drive out of the park was a miserable experience , as at least two platoons of the buggers made it into the car with us despite our “we just robbed a bank” getaway style . We kept the AC on full blast in an attempt to force them to the back of the car from the wind sheer . 

I shall not return to that hallowed ground where many fought and died . I still hear the buzzing in my ears on many a still and quiet night .

"Move over laws do indeed exist in all states . 

Law enforcement officers usually will not tell you the cost of the citation , that’s the job of the clerk of court of the county in which the citation was issued.  And before you hypothesize , if a trooper issued you the citation , he doesn’t work for the jurisdiction receiving the citation money . 

And you can’t accuse it of being a “setup” when someone observes you violating a law . If a cop is watching a roadway and observes you jaywalking in an area and not using a crosswalk , that’s not a “setup”, you just got caught . 

Your defense to this is if there was a car beside you preventing you from moving over efficiently , but most roads in the keys have ample sight lines , I doubt it was a surprise when you saw them . 

Another possible defense is if you show Connecticut has no move over law and you were simply ignorant , however the highways in Florida do have gigantic signs educating people to “move over”.

"They are VERY strict about just sleeping in your car on the side of the road. The state park campgrounds are nice, although Bahia Honda would be my pick, followed by John Pennekamp depending on what part of the Keys you want to be in. Long Key has a campground, but less amenities than the others. There are also a number of KOA and private campgrounds that people really like, but I don't have any personal experience. 

My only suggestions are...

1 - Book NOW, as these places fill up MANY months in advance. 

2 - Camping in the Keys during summer is HOT and HUMID and there are A LOT of bugs. I've camped there a number of times, but the one time we did it in the summer we gave up and found a motel.

"These guys in this thread are all too key west centric. Isla Bella on marathon is a really nice luxury hotel with a beach that will run you around 500 in peak season. Also close to sombrero beach and writhing driving distance to key west if you want to shoot in for the day.

Post card inn on Islamorada is similarly nice and has a beach (but you should rent a boat and shoot out to the sandbar; it’s within site of the hotel so an east bait ride for a newbie in the keys)",t2_xxxwu,Starks40oz,0,1646277826.0,0,t1_hz4y6w5,hz4y6w5,False,[deleted],t3_t5h6fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/t5h6fp/halp_looking_for_places_to_stay_in_the_keys_that/,Halp!

"Marathon should have something and it’s got Sombrero beach. Not much compared to typical Florida style but sandier and you can walk into the water there. But your hotel won’t be there, it’s public. In Islamorada you should be able to get a decent hotel with water access but most of the beaches don’t lead to the water. Right now we are heading into our busiest season so everything will be $$.

"No real good answer for this.  The main reef that runs the length of the Keys is about 3 miles out into the Atlantic. This is where almost all the good snorkeling is. There is a protected snorkel/swim area at John Pennekamp Park. It’s not great but you will see some little fish. From Marathon I don’t think it’s worth the drive, but maybe a stopover if you are driving back North. You can try off the beach around Bahia Honda. Probably won’t see much. I’ve dove for lobster in the channels around there, and there is some structure and a little stuff to see, but you can get very strong currents. I’d be cautions without a boat or at least a kayak as you don’t want to get swept away by the current if you are diving in any of the channels or around the bridges. Lots of sharks under the bridges as well. 

Honestly, if you want to snorkel, I would really recommend spending the $40-50 and going on any of the snorkel tour boats they have everywhere. It’s a good time, not too expensive, and what you will see is going to be 100x better than anything you can access from the shore.",t2_su924,sailphish,0,1645909542.0,0,t1_hyk72nn,hyk72nn,True,clonegian,t3_t25gjd,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/t25gjd/best_snorkeling_spots_without_needing_a_boat/,Best snorkeling spots without needing a boat?,/r/floridakeys/comments/t25gjd/best_snorkeling_spots_without_needing_a_boat/hyk72nn/,14,r/floridakeys,0,14

"If you're an outdoor person, get a kayak or paddleboard rental at one of the upper keys and go through the mangrove trails in the bay like buttonwood sound and across the bay to long sound - trails in that area, or the ones closer to the middle keys if that's where you'll be stopping, if you feel comfortable kayaking and navigating on your own. You'll see more nature and critters that way than through the pennecamp trail with tons of people on vacation with kids. Don't land anywhere in the bay though - there's protected nesting areas. If you don't feel comfortable on your own, stick to guided tours - but kayaking through mangroves should be on your list if you've never done it.


Edit to add: of you specific questions, I've done work with the Turtle Hospital, Dolphin Research Center, and Theater of the Sea, and have been to Butterfly Conservatory, Hemingway House, and History of Diving Museum. Of the aquarium type places, I'd say Turtle Hospital has the best info and experience, and the funds go the furthest, DRC would be next. Hemingway House would get my next vote, super interesting - if you are into that kind of thing - some people come out of it bored because they had no interest in Hemingway, history, writing, ""the good ol' days"", etc - I loved it. Same for history of diving for me, but I have a degree in ocean engineering and have a genuine interest in how we got to where we are with the ability to work underwater. Most people end up at the history of diving because the hotel they are staying in or the dive charter they used or something gave them 50% off the entry fee. Also, as others have said - the sunset cruise is a sham, seriously, every city has people that do that, if you are on a honeymoon or something it's nice, but it's not a unique Key West experience.",t2_6wxdh,alue42,0,1645584054.0,0,t1_hy1u0a4,hy1u0a4,False,pierretong,t3_sz0u39,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/sz0u39/dry_tortugas_florida_keys_questions/,Dry Tortugas & Florida Keys Questions,/r/floridakeys/comments/sz0u39/dry_tortugas_florida_keys_questions/hy1u0a4/,2,r/floridakeys,0,2

"If you're really into snorkelling, you'll find 2.5 hrs inadequate imo. There are several areas around the island and fort to explore that are different and fun to explore.

Butterfly conservatory is a pretty short affair as is hemingway house. You could easily do both in a morning and still have plenty of time for other activities in key west.

"Close enough. The view is looking from Fill #3 - (closest to Lower Mat. - Lignumvitae, I think) to the East towards Upper Matecumbe. The pre-Hurricane Donna ""Indian Key Draw Bridge"" is visible in the distance. 

The Aqueduct ran above the water on the Oceanside (to the right). The bridge-keepers home was also on the Oceanside. It is visible to the right of the draw.

"Hi there, paramedic here who works in the keys. 

In terms of crime safety, Key West is very safe for walking around both day and night. 

However, auto vs pedestrian, auto vs bike and auto vs motorcycle/moped accidents are very common, not only in Key West but throughout the keys. Be cautious and situationally aware. People are usually site seeing, looking around and gawking and not paying attention to traffic patterns as the should. Even if you have a right-away, be careful and make sure you're seen.

To add:

Restaurants:
- 915 on Duval for fresh homemade pasta. Upstairs and down have the same menu. 
- happy hour at Martin’s on Duval for half off all small plates, I love the schnitzel
- if you’re here and they have a meal happening: The Lost Kitchen Key West. 5th generation conch (someone from the keys) chef Martin is amazing and the atmosphere is very chill. This is a super locals event. 

More local to OP on Big Pine:
- Grouper upstairs or down on Cudjoe has the best food. My New Joint upstairs has live music and more shared plate style, downstairs is a traditional restaurant and has $12 blue plate specials every lunch. 
- KiKis on little torch is a great place to hang out for lunch or happy hour, or dinner if you have bug spray. Everything is outdoors, you can walk down the pier and explore the wildlife. The food is solid, I love their fried pickles. It’s also a great bar to just enjoy the keys at.

"I’ve only been to key west but it has some amazing bars for whatever vibe you want. I’ll list a few and why I like them and if that sounds like an atmosphere you’d like, check em out. 

Green Parrot - this is the most iconic bar in key west. Don’t let people tell you it’s Sloppy Joes. It’s one of the oldest bars in American they have good live music and the most true key west atmosphere on the island.  

Greene Street Cigar bar - they only sell wine and beer, but this cigar lounge is worth a visit if you smoke. Key West was cigar city USA in the past so it’s nice to pay homage to that and have an excellent smoke and a beer. 

The Whistle - this is the middle story of a 3 story building with different bars on each level. The bill is downstairs and the clothing optional garden of Eden is on the roof. The whistle has a New Orleans style balcony over looking Duval. Once the sun goes down it’s an excellent spot to park, drink, catch a breeze, and watch the show beneath you. 

Food: There are plenty of amazing high class restaurants in Key West but let me point out some that you won’t find in your google search. 

Mr. Z’s - This is a late night Philly cheese steak joint. They are worth visiting anytime, but a cheese steak after a night on Duval is heaven. They also have good pizza. 

Cuban Coffee Queen - For all your coffee needs stop in here. If you’re on this key early they also have excellent breakfast sandwiches and Cuban sandwiches.",t2_2madjb88,Hardcorelivesss,0,1645007042.0,0,t1_hx5n8wg,hx5n8wg,True,FunkTheFreak,t3_stfe4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/stfe4f/visiting_next_month_what_are_your_favorite_bars/,Visiting next month.

"Hey. I run an eco-tour company out of Hollywood, Florida that takes people to the Florida Keys and The Everglades. 

The traffic on thursday is not that bad but weekend traffic can be rough (especially sunday). The drive down Cart Sound Road is beuatiful I would highly recomend driving down that road if you have never done it.

I would reccomend Snorkeling or Diving at Captain Slates Dive Center in Tavanier especially if it is on a friday. They have special dives on friday where they feed nurse sharks and eels. It is really cool. Another thing I would reccomend is checking out the Everglades. The Everglades is a national wonder and it is one of my favorite places on earth. In Flamingo in the south of the main entrence (Homestead) you are pretty much gurunteed to see Manatees and Crocodiles. 

I would recommend Mrs. Macs Kitchen. It is more of a locally spot with great food. If you like more refined eateries I would recomend Square Grouper and Chef Micheals.",t2_j7vtw09p,Wild_lime_adventures,0,1643735678.0,0,t1_hv5mbfv,hv5mbfv,True,AdultToyStoreFan,t3_scxtoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/scxtoh/first_timer_in_april_what_do_i_need_to_know/,"First timer in April, what do I need to know?",/r/floridakeys/comments/scxtoh/first_timer_in_april_what_do_i_need_to_know/hv5mbfv/,1,r/floridakeys,0,1

"Hello. I run an eco-tour company based in Hollywood Florida that takes people to both Islamarada and Key West. In addition to this, I have spent many days in practically all of the habitable Florida Keys. Islamarada and Key West both have wonderful things to offer and are slightly different. Here I will way pros and cons.

Key West does have a better nightlife then Islamarada but it is no longer as ""funky"" or ""crazy"" as it once was. Key West is basically a cruise ship town now as all the famous bars and pubs there no longer have a local feel (for the most part). That being said, there are enjoyable dives in Key Largo/Islamarada as well. My favorite part of Key West these days, is the archetecture and history there.

Key West also has worse Snorkeling and Diving compared to Islamarada. Islamarada has tons of amazing snorkeling and diving companies and cites to check out. If you do decide on staying in Key West I would try to spend most of the outdoor time either 45 min north in Looe Key (Prob best snorkeling in the keys)/ Great Heron Wildlife Refuge, take a ferry over to the Dry Tortugas, or at Ft. Zachary Taylor Beach.

As some of the other people have said, you can easily drive the two hours from Islamarada to Key West for a day trip and do this once or twice. Islamarada is close too all the amazing Kayak opputunities, beaches, State Parks, etc. If you do decide on going to Islamarada make sure to drive north to North Key Largo where the bottanic park is. That part of the keys is undervisited and really cool.

"I'd go Islamorada for the pure relax mode. Key West is ALL about drinking and seeing wasted people on the streets partying at night. Seriously. People getting sick even some places openly. My fam found it dirty/trashy, etc.

Islamorada has more of the class feel to it, and you can always take a day trip out to Key West in a few hours, spend time there checking it out, and be back to Islamorada at your place before you guys see the craziness. You get all the tourists just going nuts at the bars so....not sure what your fam prefers. Islamorada also offers snorkel charters/fishing charters and a dolphin sanctuary very close. Tons of cute shopping for kids and older crowd which is classy and not trashy.

Key Largo just north also offers excellent dive or snorkeling and some excellent eating.

"im going back to the keys in march. my wife and i used to go almost yearly for several years until we had our daughter but we havent been back for many years.

the keys are like no other area. its awesome and so laid back. if you have time do the drive down to key west. go over the seven mile bridge. stop at certain places that you see along the way. one restaurant we love to stop at on summerland key is mangrove mamas. trust me. also, find a pub/restaurant called the no name pub on big pine key. its a old shack and its built with dollar bills. wondering what i mean? just stop in maybe have a beer and youll see.

my wife and i got certified in diving on big pine key at a place call underseas dive shop. it was on a whim during a week long vacation. we never planned it but turned out to be a never forget experience out on looe key sanctuary.

keys west has its own charm. find the ""southern most point"" of the u.s. landmark and take a pict. its cool. stop in margaritaville restaurant. fun place.

"Cheapest is going to be a camper or tent and a KOA park, the closest surf is a reef break about 10 miles out, only accessible by boat and is usually so mushy it not much fun.  The closest break after that is Jupiter FL, which is about a 3.5 hour drive on a good day but it is a direct run thru the gauntlet of Miami thru West Palm and even there the conditions have to be right, you may find yourself having to run all the way to Sebastian Inlet before you find a decent break. The beaches down here are man-made, and do not wander on for miles and miles most are short and packed. The other commenter who mentioned Mexico is right, if you want beaches Mexico is going to have better beaches. If you want waves and beaches, Costa Rica is also hard to beat.  


People come here to drink and fish, that is about it, if neither of those are high on your agenda it's not going to be the place for you. I would suggest maybe taking a weekend trip to somewhere between Marathon and above Big Coppitt. That is the authentic experience of living here and it is pretty much boating, spearfishing, wakeboarding, tubeing, line fishing, hanging out on the sandbar and drinking.",t2_a237iolk,FRIKI-DIKI-TIKI,0,1643114370.0,0,t1_hu59f72,hu59f72,True,Fordy_15,t3_sc6ol0,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/sc6ol0/temporary_living/,Temporary living?,/r/floridakeys/comments/sc6ol0/temporary_living/hu59f72/,6,r/floridakeys,0,6

"That is one reason I love Islamorada! As much as I enjoy the small town laid back vibe and Keys life, I also like being able to run up to Target, get fancy donuts in Wynwood, eat Indian food or ramen or pho, visit botanical gardens, etc. I will day trip there waaaay more often than to Key West.

"Now that you’ll have enough time on the ground here so to speak… Pennekamp park in Key Largo has kind of all in one shopping for some of your activities (mangrove paddle and snorkel) but personally I would recommend Paddle! the Florida Keys in Tavernier for your mangrove eco tour and Islander Girl tours in Islamorada for snorkeling - I prefer Alligator Reef/Lighthouse area for that. 

Of course no guarantees but the manatees show up a lot for Paddle! tours and they never have a shortage of equipment so even if you just go last minute you can rent at the best rates. If you have never done stand up paddle boarding you should do that, gives you better view than kayaking and is not hard. They are great with beginners. 

I’m partial to Islamorada Brewery & Distillery since I work there and we have some unique options like cocktail flights and rum tastings, but we do have two great places making their own beer and providing spots to relax within one awesome mile in Islamorada, with Lorelei right in between. It is a great bar for sunset with a lively scene, though I also enjoy a more laid back vibe at Morada Bay Beach Cafe where you’ll get that more picture perfect beach. 

If you split your nights you can shorten your drive each day as you make your way to key west and explore different areas fully but it’s really not that bad to drive down from the upper Keys in a mid-afternoon trip and come back after breakfast the next day. I usually aim to arrive around/by 3-4 pm, visit some of the distilleries before sunset, go to nice dinner after (probably make reservations), then hit the town for so much live music!!!",t2_4yefec9q,drinkmorehops,0,1642680578.0,0,t1_htg6a6o,htg6a6o,True,Dizzy-red-head,t3_s680bp,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/s680bp/2_nights_with_rental_car/,2 nights with rental car,/r/floridakeys/comments/s680bp/2_nights_with_rental_car/htg6a6o/,2,r/floridakeys,0,2
"Not yet mentioned: Founders Park in Islamorada. The beach is small but swimmable there, better than Pennekamp and Harry Harris for sure. Playground for kids. Entry fee but I’ve heard many resorts can issue you a pass that gets you in free. Personally I like Sombrero most, since I live in Islamorada it’s not as far as Bahia Honda, it has your beach day vibes, and there are plenty of places to eat in Marathon. The “back side” of Bahia Honda (horseshoe mentioned by Starks40oz) is much better than the ocean side which is usually sea grassy as others have said. But I’ll usually only go there if I’m heading to Key West. Not as much right around so pack your food or go between meals and after the beach continue down to No Name Pub in Big Pine.
Edit to add - Fort Zach beach and Truman Waterfront in Key West. I wouldn’t necessarily go to Key West just for beach day but if you’re already planning a trip there you could add that on. Seeing the sunset from Fort Zach is a chill alternative to the bustle of Mallory Square and there is a great splash pad/playground area at the waterfront park.",t2_4yefec9q,drinkmorehops,0,1642679298.0,0,t1_htg4dqh,htg4dqh,True,clbris4,t3_s70ro2,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/s70ro2/beautiful_beaches_near_key_largo/,Beautiful beaches near Key Largo?,/r/floridakeys/comments/s70ro2/beautiful_beaches_near_key_largo/htg4dqh/,2,r/floridakeys,0,2

"We were just there and I tried to do the same thing. 
John penne camp is tiny and there is virtually no beach, def need water shoes because it’s not very sandy and it hurts the feet. I didn’t go in the water but my husband and older daughter did, it was neat but not the Caribbean blue. 
We then tried a beach in Harry harris beach which was actually pretty gross, muddy sand, jelly fish, crabs I can’t remember what else but was even smaller than the first. 
We didn’t go to Anne’s beach this time but I remember the water being lovely and very shallow but a little muddy. Bahia Honda looks the nicest. If you drive to key west the beaches there are slightly nicer but still not the beautiful water I assume you speak.

"Not to pry, but where might that be? I’ve definitely had the best luck with live bait. Live shrimp under a popping cork can do a lot. One reason is you can get movement with a stationary bait. And a lot of the fish near shore will hang near structure like pylons, piers, mangroves,or oyster beds etc. So sometimes a traditional lure you pull through the water will only be inside the “strike zone” for a very brief window and you risk getting hung up the more you drag it through the column. A cork + shrimp for example you can pretty much hit the pylon with the bait and let it fall next to it and not get hung up. 

For fishing on a shore line without structure, live swimming bait can go a long way. Because you in general want to get the bait as far from shore as you can and if you are pulling back a lure it doesn’t have much residence time in the deeper water. So a cork (and one that can catch wind if your wind is offshore so it will move the bait deeper and deeper) with a live bait fish under it will give you again that action while stationary. 

For me, I’ve had the best luck with lures when fishing for top water strikes using “straws” or similar rigs for mackerels. But even then live bait seems to often be better. 

Some fishes don’t mind cut baits. But this is a similar strategy: get the bait to the strike areas and hold it there. 

In general, to really get the most efficacy out of your lures you will need to find areas where the bait will cross over a strike zone thru much of your return reel. This often means a pier so you can reel parallel to shore, or perhaps near a bridge so you can reel across a channel etc.

Good luck, wish I was there :)",t2_543ike4,southernwx,0,1642527078.0,0,t1_ht79duk,ht79duk,False,imlose444,t3_s705g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/floridakeys/comments/s705g5/heading_to_the_keys_for_shore_fishing_what_gear/,Heading to the keys for shore fishing - What gear am I forgetting?,/r/floridakeys/comments/s705g5/heading_to_the_keys_for_shore_fishing_what_gear/ht79duk/,2,r/floridakeys,0,2

"Like others said, two nights isn’t much time and the drive from Key West to St Augustine is a lot (I used to do this once a month and you’re looking at about 9 hours). 

Maybe I missed it but when are you looking to travel? With your timeline for travel I’d recommend staying in Islamorada for your two days. You could book a snorkel tour, fishing charter, kayak/stand up paddle board tour, there’s lots to do in that area without making the trek down to KW. If you were spending an extra day, it might be worth it to do a day in Islamorada and two in KW, but again, that drive back up to St Augustine is brutal.

I have also experienced these critters in our winter travels to the West Coast of Florida.  However, I always take a bottle of Ole Time Woodsman Fly Dope with me.  As I understand it, biting gnats and other insects are attracted to the carbon dioxide flume that we emit when we breathe.  Don't ask me how they came up with the formula but back in the 1800's two fly fisherman concocted a solution that actually interferes with an insect's ability to detect carbon dioxide.

"I drive there 1-2 times per year from MA (going on 9 trips now) with 2 dogs in a rented minivan…

* Rent a car if you can. Not worth putting the mileage on your own. Minivans are best even without kids. Lots of room.

*Pack in Rubbermaid bins instead of suitcases. Easy access. 

*Dont pack too many snacks or food. Rest stop places are fine and you’ll probably end up eating and spending less. 

*Stay overnight on the SC/GA border. We like best western, Hampton inn, etc. just stay on 95. 

*when you get into Florida, stop at the first rest stop and buy a SunPass. You’ll be on the Florida turnpike when 95 ends and it’s way easier than looking for change. They’re cheap too, in a vending machine. 

*once you’re through the nightmare of Miami, you’re pretty much going straight all the way. Go slow, enjoy the ride. Probably hit some traffic but you’re where you want to be so no rush.

*if you want to stop to eat once you’re in the Keys, I suggest islamorada fish company, Wahoos, Lorelei’s, etc. easy to get a table and back on the road. 

*put in a Publix instacart order that morning. Then go pick it up before you get to your rental. You won’t want to go back out to grocery shop after that ride. Don’t forget beer! 

*unload your car and get out on the island! My husband and I always stop at the green parrot for our first beer!

"Flew in from Dallas and drove from Miami. The drive down seemed to take forever but the views were beautiful. Key Largo definitely had some stop & go, so be prepared for some super delays. It also doesn't help that speed limits are significantly reduced for much of the drive (with cops everywhere) so you'll be lucky to even break 60mph. You'll get slowed down to 35 a lot and there's ALWAYS some guy driving well below the limit with a line of people stuck behind them (it's mostly one lane).

Or at least he did at the time, this was a few years ago, so there were no maga flags. The captain is an ex firefighter or something, anyway, it was a fun day, ended up hanging out at the sandbar after our visit.  He was actually pretty friendly for a MAGA.

"Meadery in Key Largo, really cute coffee and vegan place called Coco Plum Place there too. 

Florida Keys Brewing in Islamorada.

Marathon: Oceanfront Park, Sweet Savannah’s has great key lime pie and ice cream. Crane Point Hammock is a decent nature walk. Castaway Waterfront Restaurant and sushi has a key lime martini 🍸 I like. The Marketplace at the upscale Isla Bella resort is a really cute coffee, ice cream, sandwich and gift shop.

Key West: Bars on Duvall Street - my favorite is the swanky General Horseplay. Wicked Lick has good ice cream. Mallory Square is pleasant.

"The schedule said the last bus was like 8:40 or something, but the bus driver said he wasn't going to make another trip after his \~7 pm run. Island time is a thing for sure, I guess. We stayed at Faro Blanco Yacht Club. Very nice place. 

Pro tip: if you get chilly in your room at night though, put on a sweatshirt, don't turn on the heat. The dust in the vents starts on fire. I guess that's pretty common across the board for hotels down there though. They don't really need the heat often. 

There are a few restaurants I highly recommend checking out in/around Marathon itself. The Lighthouse Grill at Faro Blanco is yummy, slightly upscale but still for the casual Keys crowd. The Sunset Grill is a great place to watch the sunset, and get drinks in giant novelty souvenir glasses. The Overseas Pub & Grill has a great laid back dive bar atmosphere in the outside area by the parking lot. The smoked fish dip is amazing. It's a local specialty, but the best we found was there. Like seriously, if I had discovered it earlier in the trip, I would've gone back there multiple times for it. And there's a secret local's bar that I'm hestitant to mention but it's just so cool I will. Hopefully this post just won't go viral haha. It's called the Dockside and it's near Sombrero beach (which is the best beach in the area, and free to visit. I'd recommend at least an afternoon there).

As for Key West, the Hemingway House is a great stop for a little history and some cat cuddling. Sloppy Joes is cool, but packed. Mallory Square for a sunset is totally worth it too. And there's like a semi-open air market there. Other than that, plenty of shops and a bar every few feet to check out. I'm sure people who have been multiple times, or spent more than a few hours in Key West can give you more guidance on that particular area.

Also, if you're renting a car, go through a rental company that isn't Ace Rent A Car. I would rather hitch hike than deal with them again.
