"Call Libby Realty. They had 2 houses for rent.  They aren't insane. Its much harder finding single apartments. 
If you can live up by Utah Trail, that's your best bet.
Gets rough by 4 corners. (north of baseline road)

Western home builders has new units. 
There are rentals but you must have a 650 score. 
Id pay a realtor fee to handle the application.

Joshua tree is $$$ bc of strs. 
Avoid ""Felony Flats"" in yucca.  Otherwise, some beautiful places. 

Check Ring neighborhood crime report.
San Bernadino Sheriff calls and

MUST check Meagans law- I will warn you now, many offenders haven't committed a felony, aren't on the list. And ones that are,  have several more stuffed under one roof. 

(yes, sexual battery is only a misdemeanor speaking from experience)

Wildcat Way by the high school resembles a yucca family neighborhood. 

Avoid Amboy road north of 62 going to the base. Thats sketch. 

There are no local police,  just sheriff dept. They no longer list Wonder Valley as a community they serve so avoid it. It's where the illegal grow houses are- guns,  drug, vicious dogs and murders. 

Check out the desert oracle podcast to fill you in.

"I was at Joshua Tree for just a day, about 6 days before this news broke. I was very aware of Bill being missing in the park. My impressions of the park and my experience, on a day where the temps were still in the high 70s, I drank a lot of water doing short hikes. Bill vanished on day where the temps were very high. 

I talked to a ranger at the main entrance before I went into the park, who told me, they deliberately kept hiking trails shorter than most National Parks, just because of the dehydration factor there. 

I went to JT on my 61 birthday. I am a trucker who regular goes from FL to CA. I dont do a lot of hiking anymore and when I was in the park, I was well aware of the danger of dehydration. I was also well aware of the danger of that with a man my age. It can and does cause confusion and the older you are, it can come on quickly. In that environment, even with lower temps, it is so arid and you lose hydration with every breath you take. 

I believe Bill went on a hike, became dehydrated and because of his age, confusion set in and he kept going the wrong direction.  And to give context, before I was a truck driver, I was a land surveyor for 25 years. Along with that, I also recreated a lot in the outdoors in the East. I have spent a lot of time in The Ten Thousand Islands in The Everglades National Park, and when I was in my late 20s, I would go out there 25 or 30 miles and camp for days on end, feeding myself on the fish I caught.

So, I know a bit about the outdoors. Now I go out west and have spent time in desert environments as an older person, I am ultra cautious. 

I once almost became a vanished person in Florida, because I waded up a tidal creek and wandered into quicksand while fishing.  I was able to get out of it and the danger was, it was low tide and if  I had not gotten clear, the high tide could have drowned me. 

I also found the skeleton of an older man, who had dementia and had wandered away from his home while doing land surveying in the 1980s. Because of that, missing person stories have always meant a bit more to me. Going missing is also kind of a hazard of my old profession, land surveying. It's because we would spend so much time in the wilderness and often alone, we could become careless. 

I'm glad Bill's family will finally haver some closure.

"""The wait is part of the experience!"" said no one ever. JTNP is 1,235 square miles, you can easily get away from the crowds if you are willing to go beyond the most popular locations...or at least get there early.

The guy who runs Cliffhanger Guides had a movie series going on but I have no idea if that is still a thing.

One thing I like about JT is my kids don't need to be entertained. We don't bring tablets and they are perfectly fine and get along without any issues. When we were in JT a couple weeks ago I talked with a couple camp guides and they told me there are way more kids at the campsites than there were just 7 years ago and they were thrilled with that development.

I’m not trying to be disrespectful with my comment but I’m pretty shocked by your question. I just got back from my first trip to Joshua Tree with my GF. We both travel a lot both in the states and internationally. We were so blown away by the scenery. Both of us found the rock formations and the vastness of it to be a borderline spiritual experience. The only complaint we had was on us….for not planning our trip better. As I said we’ve been to numerous places and we just didn’t understand the sheer size of Joshua tree National Park.

"Yes, you can get in any time of day!

It will likely be pretty good weather but it can definitely vary so I would just check as it comes up.

The Cholla Cactus Garden is road accessible and has a parking lot. It is a nice and short scenic walk around the cholla cacti. Definitely perfect for sunrise!

Hall of Horrors is a very easy, short and flat hike. Hidden Valley Nature Trail is a nice and easy hike with some steps. There are some day use picnic spots in this parking lot as well that I’d highly recommend! Barker Dam and Wall Street Mill are two hikes pretty close to each other and are both relatively easy as well. I recommend the website All Trails for more info and reviews on these hikes. There are so many more but these are pretty popular choices!

Other great and easy things in the park I’d recommend are Keys View, Skull Rock and off-roading (if that’s something you enjoy) on Queen Valley Road and Geology Tour Road!

I also recommend bringing water and food/snacks with you because it can be a long drive out of the park just to get food (but there are lots of great choices in town).

"You might be right, but I think it's a little manipulative to totally conceal the fact that it's being completely run by a church. The way that it's described as a ""media outreach ministry"" internally says to me that they're putting it on with the goal of ""reaching out"" and recruiting people to their church, either through converting non-Christians or attracting Christians from other churches.

Think of it this way: imagine you work at Walmart and you see a poster in the employee area for an independent ""worker's rally"" happening nearby. You do some digging, and you find out that this rally is actually an outreach program for the Walmart corporate office. They're the ones funding it, their staff are the ones running it and speaking on the stage, and half of the people in attendance are other people from the Walmart corporate office, but they don't mention their involvement anywhere on the poster. Do you think that workers rally is going to be fair and even-handed, or do you think it's designed with the purpose of discouraging Walmart employees from unionizing, advocating for their rights, etc.?

The truth doesn't fear interrogation, and a church operating in good faith shouldn't fear mentioning their involvement in something, even if the religious overtones are kept to a minimum. I'm not anti-religion; I'm actually pretty pro-religion in my personal life. But that's why it bothers me when I see religious people using such underhanded tactics to recruit people who clearly don't want to go to a religious event.",t2_kwwfh2fx,Low-Faithlessness212,0,1647798869.0,0,t1_i1fh64m,i1fh64m,False,Low-Faithlessness212,t3_ticf51,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoshuaTree/comments/ticf51/psa_theres_a_new_music_venue_in_yucca_valley/,"PSA: There's a new ""music venue"" in Yucca Valley that's secretly evangelizing for a local church",/r/JoshuaTree/comments/ticf51/psa_theres_a_new_music_venue_in_yucca_valley/i1fh64m/,5,r/JoshuaTree,0,5

"Definitely enter at the west entrance in the village of JT and just take Park Blvd from there to the North Entrance exit.  It takes maybe a half hour to drive that if you don't stop to get out and look (though I'm sure you'll want to!).  This route takes you through the most scenic (car accessible) area of the park with the dramatic features JT is known for.

From the North Exit in 29 Palms, do the route through Wonder Valley then the Mojave Trails National Monument to Amboy/Route 66 then through the Mojave National Preserve, which will spit you out on 15 to Vegas.  About 3 and a half hours to do the drive from JT to Vegas, and Three National Parks in one road trip.  I did that drive to/from Vegas/JT a few months ago, and it's one of the most stunning drives in the US.  Plus the opportunity to stop at the famous Roys motel for a drink and snack in the Amboy ghost town.  

As others have said, just make sure you have gas, food, water and a cooler.  Know that you won't have cell service in JTNP or MNP, but otherwise I had great service.  Was able to use Waze to navigate the entire way.  When leaving 29 Palms, make sure you have a full tank of gas bc i don't believe there's gas en route until you reach Nevada.

"I'm not at all an expert on the situation so you'll wan to confirm all of this, but my guess is that it can only be considered an ADU if you make both lots one single lot and do not keep them separate. If you keep the lots separate it would likely need its own utilities but if you combine the lots it could be considered an ADU and it can tie into your existing water, electric, and septic (if the tank is large enough and close enough). However if you combine the lots you may be limited in future construction on the property as well. I believe unincorporated SB county allows 1 primary structure, 1 ADU, and 1 detached garage. 

Again you'll want to confirm all of this as I may be off the mark but I'm in the process of getting some work done myself and I recently got a quote for a 475 sq ft shed roof style ADU that was $160k-$180k, which seems absurdly expensive.

"No first-hand experience, but from the town of Yucca Valley's website: 

""Storage Shed Permits  
A storage shed permit is required prior to construction of all sheds over 120 square feet in area built within the Town of Yucca Valley.  A building plan and site plan showing lot size, property lines, and the location of all existing and proposed buildings must be approved by the Building and Safety (B&S) department before a storage shed permit will be issued.  Sheds with less than 120 square feet have setback requirements, however sheds over 120 square feet must meet additional setback requirements which can be obtained from the Planning department.  Sheds under 120 square feet are exempt from requiring a building permit, but check with the Planning department for property setbacks.  Sheds that exceed 120 square feet must meet setbacks for accessory buildings.  
Plan review of your project may find that your construction is not in compliance with zoning regulations in your area, or that the work will require additional digging permits before construction can proceed.  In these cases, the B&S department will contact you regarding the necessary steps.  Additional permits and fees may be required depending on the nature of the project.  
For more information about storage shed permits and fees, contact the B&S department at 760-365-0099 x 302.""",t2_4hgimeqp,falsifiablepopper,0,1646773420.0,0,t1_hzvzgja,hzvzgja,True,[deleted],t3_t9opik,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoshuaTree/comments/t9opik/anybody_have_first_hand_experience_with_buying/,"Anybody have first hand experience with buying some land and putting an off grid ""shed"" there for camping? shed meaning <= 100 sf thus no permit required -- not planning to build a home (details in text)",/r/JoshuaTree/comments/t9opik/anybody_have_first_hand_experience_with_buying/hzvzgja/,2,r/JoshuaTree,0,2

"I know this thread is two years old but as a hunter and 2A enthusiast I'd like to share some knowledge:

That's a link to a color-coded PDF map of San Bernardino County of where you can and can't shoot, including gun restrictions on type and caliber and if nighttime shooting is allowed, I'd use the OnX Maps App to help cross-reference and see what areas are BLM land. It is basically a visual map of this San Bernardino County Ordinance:   
[https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/sanbernardino/latest/sanberncty\_ca/0-0-0-154757](https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/sanbernardino/latest/sanberncty_ca/0-0-0-154757)

Aside from the High Desert Rod and Gun club in Morongo, there is also a private gun range in 29. Google it, I can say no more.  


Now I am not a lawyer, and what I'm about to say should not be construed as legal advice, but as I have a family member that works in LE and has a law degree, confirmed my interpretation of the law such as this, and I will include links for anyone that wants to go down the rabbit hole:

https://library.municode.com/ca/twentynine\_palms/codes/code\_of\_ordinances

Title 1 of 29 Palms Municipal Code states essentially that for anything the city doesn't make a law for, you revert to the San Bernardino Country Ordinances.   
29 Palms CHAPTER 11.12 - RESTRICTIONS ON SHOOTING  
 simply reinforces the no firing of any firearm or bow within 150 yards of basically anyone's cultivated lands, occupied structures, tents, mobile homes, trains, planes, anything that can have a person in it, without their written permission, but does not specifically prohibit the shooting of firearms except at night time. And since in the San B County Ordinance it considers 29 Palms an incorporated territory(meaning it makes its own ordinances) the County has no specific restrictions. It states ""Except as otherwise provided by statute of the State,"" referring to California Penal Code:  
[https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/home.xhtml](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/home.xhtml)  
Part 6. Control of Deadly Weapons: Title 4. Firearms- Division 5. Carrying Firearms. Ch.1 Miscellaneous Rules Related to Carrying Firearms, Ch.3 Carrying a Loaded Firearm, Ch.6 Openly Carrying an unloaded Handgun, and Ch.7 Carrying an Unloaded Firearm  
Basically, just use the search function and type in 'Firearm' and it will pull up all the Penal Codes referring to what you can and can't do with a gun and many of these laws include exceptions to them SPECIFICALLY stating that people are allowed by law to carry firearms in public for hunting or target shooting even in some instances with respect to gun ranges. Remember that most land within a city's limits is probably owned so Trespass Law comes into play as well but basically in California if raw unimproved land isn't fenced or there are no 'No Trespass' or 'No Shooting/Hunting' signs posted around the perimeter at no less than 3 per mile and at every road and trail leading into the property then it is legal to hunt on it. (Part 1. Of Crimes and Punishments: Title 14. Malicious Mischief)

But, if you're going to hunt, that also means that the Rules and Regs of CDFW come into play so you'll need to make sure you're in compliance with these:

"If this is your first time visiting JTNP, I'd recommend entering by car in the North Entrance then driving down to the cholla cactus garden to get a taste of the low desert part of the park, and doing that nature trail.  Early morning is best bc the sun over the cholla is gorgeous.  After that nature trail, head back up to Park Blvd.  I'd suggest stopping at skull Rock to do the discovery nature trail and skull rock nature trails.  Then continue driving through to the west entrance (while being amazed!) And do the barker dam and hidden valley nature trails.  You can realistically do all of this between sunrise and sunset, with time to spare so that you can pop into the town of JT for lunch.  This is exactly what I did when I took my brother on his first trip to JTNP in February.  Make sure to do it on Friday instead of Saturday and start early!  In the morning, you are far more likely to see wildlife and have one tenth of the crowding.

That's a great first day intro to see the best of the accessible areas of the park.  Then on your subsequent days, I'm personally a huge fan of the Willow Hole trail.  It takes you into the Wonderland of Rocks, and we had a fun time scrambling and even napping in a secluded Boulder field before heading back the way we came.   Enjoy!

If you're hiking the Boy Scout Trail, near the entrance station it's all day use, then south of that, everything on the Wonderland of Rocks side is day use (like you said), and there's cut of ""non Wilderness"" part on the other side of the trail (at least 3/4 a mile or more from the B S trail. The cuts are in steps so the distance varies) and south of the junction trail to Willow hole which begins another non Wilderness area.

You must go through RV permitting in Sacramento or at least that was what the process was a couple of years ago.  There are a lot of unpermitted places around but it is a fine and a possible tear down if you are caught.  There are a lot of people buying RVs and putting them on their property but then some of them are getting caught.   There are some permitted tiny homes but all need a permanent foundation,t2_7rlftnhv,Maleficent_Agent4773,0,1646086720.0,0,t1_hyu42lq,hyu42lq,False,XYZfoolishboy,t3_l13vva,https://www.reddit.com/r/JoshuaTree/comments/l13vva/need_help_with_lotland_questions/,need help with lot/land questions,/r/JoshuaTree/comments/l13vva/need_help_with_lotland_questions/hyu42lq/,1,r/JoshuaTree,0,1

"Years ago on a cross country road trip, right after being scared shitless from going thru border partol/homeland security checkpoint on I10, we made our way to Joshua Tree on a whim and managed to get a super badass camp spot at jumbo rock.  Didnt plan on it, but it worked out, and it was so friggin cool. Wtf are those rocks doing out there, where did they come from? 
We got camp set up, made a bit of food, and when the moon started to rise, I discovered that it was a full moon, and not a cloud in the sky. I ate some mushrooms for supper instead and spent all night scrambling on those mystical boulders in the full moon light. Talk about a magikal feeling.

"that's a cool find.

My best find is still magical... I was walking in a wash near rattlesnake canyon, which has TONS of rocks scattered, and I was about 1/2 mil from the parking lot.  I notice a smooth, round rock sticking out of the sand (about fist sized), like the hundreds all around, but for some reason I decided to kick it.  when I did, I noticed it looked like a heart shaped rock.

I picked it up, looked at the bottom, and noticed it had stamped letters and numbers on it.  I shook it, and there was something inside.  A few weeks later I couldn't resist, so I broke it open.  Inside was a ceramic cube, like the size of a sugar cube.

I can't even comprehend the odds of me finding such a thing.

Hmm.  That *could* be significant, but maybe it is; maybe it isn't.  Some people just aren't into summit registers.  Some people hate them and deliberately vandalize them.  Or maybe he didn't think of it.  Maybe he was in a hurry.  Maybe he just didn't see it.  I don't recall where the one on Quail Mtn is, but sometimes they're placed under rocks to protect them from the elements and aren't out in the open.

He did make it pretty far if he was up by the Panorama Trail, certainly well past Quail Mtn.  We are pretty sure he started at Juniper Flats.  He pretty much had to go over the ridge the Quail Mtn is the high point of.  Once you're atop that ridge, it's the most logical path north.  I distinctly recall that when I went from Quail Mtn to Smith Water   
Canyon that some of the terrain was a little slow; there were a lot of ups and downs out there, if he went north, the most logical route is via Quail Mtn, but who knows?

But the fact there were no pings from his phone until the end suggest one of two things. Either he traveled a route devoid of cell coverage (meaning Lang Canyon or Smithwater) or he went over Quail to Smithwater without thinking his situation perilous enough to turn on his phone until he finds no water at his destination, but then he's out of coverage again. I'm leaning toward thinking he expected water at Smithwater/Quail, overexpended his energy/water reserve getting there, finally realizing he was in a survival situation and picked wrong.

"Yeah, well it would not have been high on my search list either.  I really figured somewhere near Smith Water Canyon.  Shows you what I know.

I'm speculating, and admittedly it is speculation, that he may have intended to do a loop hike, which many hikers prefer -- particularly if you want to see more of the park.  Descending Johnny Lang Canyon with its trail would be an obvious route north and would place him along Quail Springs Road.  I've looked at a loop through there involving that very trail.

Maybe by that point he was disoriented and/or confused and instead of turning right toward Park Blvd (about 2 mi east), he heads NW/NNW toward... perhaps the West Entrance Station and it's water spigot?  I'm not sure exactly where he was found with respect to the Panorama Trail.  A straight line drawn from the junction of the Quail Springs Road and Lang Canyon Trail to the Entrance Station would pass near the junction of the Bigfoot and Panorama Trails.

"Well, I'm no expert, but I speculate below on what he may have been up to.  *Maybe* it all makes sense if he were fixated on water.  I'm assuming that he was found relatively close to the junction of the Bigfoot and Panorama Trails.

Map link:  [https://caltopo.com/m/A1L2D](https://caltopo.com/m/A1L2D)

**SCENARIO:**Ewasko ascends to Quail Mtn. Instead of heading back the way he came, he wants to do a loop back to his car via Johnny Lang Canyon. There's a trail marked on the map in Johnny Lang Canyon. He follows the ridges first over to Mt. Minerva Hoyt (pink dotted line) and then follows the ridges over to the site of the Lang Mine (green dotted line). He then descends what's left of the old Lang Mine Trail (purple dotted/dashed line) down to Quail Spgs Road. Perhaps he's underestimated the trip, but for whatever reason he's **out of water** when he reaches Quail Spgs Road.

What does he do? Personally, I'd head east on the Quail Spgs Road and hope to flag down a car -- *if* I were thinking clearly. If he's out of water, maybe he's not thinking clearly. He could be fixated on water. In the Grand Canyon, dehydrated hikers have been known to try to cut straight down to the Colorado River, leading to their demise.

Whether he's thinking clearly or not, Mr. Ewasko decides to go for the West Entrance Station, ""only"" 4 miles away (cross country). He remembers that there's water available, and, if he's severely dehydrated, that (water) may be all he can think about. He shoots a compass bearing or some such and starts on a straight line route to the Entrance Station. I've plotted such a straight line route on my map. It passes near the junction of the Panorama and Big Foot Trails. Sadly, he never makes it, succumbing somewhere in the vicinity of the junction of the Panorama and Big Foot Trails. Even if he's further west along the Panorama Trail (I don't know the exact spot his remains were found), his intended destination may have been the West Entrance Station.

Whether he's thinking clearly or not, Mr. Ewasko decides to go for the West Entrance Station, ""only"" 4 miles away (cross country). He remembers that there's *water* available, and, if he's severely dehydrated, that (water) may be all he can think about. He shoots a compass bearing or some such and starts on a straight line route to the Entrance Station. I've plotted such a straight line route on my map. It passes near the junction of the Panorama and Big Foot Trails. Sadly, he never makes it, succumbing somewhere in the vicinity of the junction of the Panorama and Big Foot Trails. Even if he's further west along the Panorama Trail (I don't know the exact spot his remains were found), his intended destination may have been the West Entrance Station.

"Yeah. But I think he must have taken the same route in that I did. It's the only thing that makes sense topographically (though wildly illogical otherwise). As I recall, it wasn't too terribly difficult, a slow grade and fairly easy to negotiate as there was a wide wash and also sections of trail here and there. (You can see the pictures in the link above to get an idea) But the end section where I wound up, and the area past it, got a bit more rugged. I seem to recall the canyon narrowed quite a bit at a certain point and it wasn't far beyond that when I turned back. However, there is a section of trail that appears beyond that that goes about halfway to where he apparently was found. So there is some logic to it that he went up this route and went as far as he could, and then expired.

So jack it up, clear the sand out, then dig down under the tires and put roots and branches down there, with some rocks. You can actually build yourself a little runway to get out.

It was very cold at night… cold enough for both of our sets of toes to become frozen! 🦶🏽 🥶 However, we were car camping meaning we slept right next to our car of which we packed extra sleeping bags (to double up), plenty of blankets and started a fire right when we arrived for some sanity. As long as you don’t have to use the bathroom multiple times at night (like me) you will be fine creating a cocoon and sleeping through the night. 🌚

"My grandparents retired to Yucca Valley in the 1950s, and I loved going there in my childhood, the 60s and 70s. I'm sure it's quite different now. In 1959 my grandfather bought 5 acres near Landers/Joshua Tree/Pioneer Town and it's hard to tell exactly where it is on the plat map. It's in an undeveloped area. I can't seem to connect what's on the plat map with the streets on Google maps and have only a general sense of the area where the five acres might be. There is conflicting info on street names. Are you good at interpreting the parcel number or know someone who is?

Joshua tree took money from the state to get Pedophiles released there for years.  It's the end of the civilization and has lots of meth and break in problems.  Don't believe me just drive around and see the difference.  There is a reason joshua tree and 29palms are half the cost in rent to Yucca Valley.

"There is a gym in yucca valley, I forgot the name but it’s easy to find. You can buy a day pass for it for about $8. Not great, but any shower is nice.

Desert hot springs has several places with pools and showers like the one already mentioned. That area, however, is more like an hour from the heart of the park, farther than that from Jumbo Rock. I have gone to this place. It’s run down but fairly cheap, and it has warm pools. Might be a good option for an evening.
