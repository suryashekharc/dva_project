CLARKSVILLE, TN (CLARKSVILLE NOW) – Wes Golden, who last week announced he’s running for county mayor in 2022, has an assault conviction on his record from an incident 19 years ago.


According to court documents obtained by Clarksville Now, Golden was arrested March 4, 2002, on a warrant for aggravated domestic assault.

Clarksville Now reached out to Golden, who said the victim was a woman he had been dating on and off at the time. He said he was out of town when the charges were filed.

According to the arrest warrant, Golden choked her to a “near unconscious state” and hit her in the back of the head multiple times.


The case was settled, and Golden pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of simple assault with a sentence of 11 months and 29 days, suspended on condition of a $25 fine, good behavior, probation and attendance of batterers’ intervention classes.

He said he pleaded guilty after months of back and forth in court to move on and “make it go away.”

Golden said he expected the case to come up when he announced his candidacy, but he hopes people will see him as a changed person.


“I was 20, 21 years old and wasn’t living the best life back then,” Golden said. “The man that I was back then, I wouldn’t have voted for him.”

Golden, who is now the Health and Safety manager for the City of Clarksville, plans to run as a Republican in the Montgomery County mayor’s race.",t2_8ifbm,Donkeyslapper84,0,1648990840.0,0,t1_i37vqhs,i37vqhs,True,politiphi,t3_tv6dft,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clarksville/comments/tv6dft/mayoral_candidate_wes_golden_was_once_arrested/,Mayoral candidate Wes Golden was once arrested for choking a woman unconscious,/r/Clarksville/comments/tv6dft/mayoral_candidate_wes_golden_was_once_arrested/i37vqhs/,8,r/Clarksville,0,8

"The roads suck. Especially the main ones. As someone else said, we are a city of 200k people made for 50k people.

First off, there is not jack shit to do here. Sure we have golf, a single mini-golf place, a couple bowling places. Downtown, nothing. There's strawberry alley. It's nice. Blackhorse is opening up again, it's nice. We have that arena opening up and an Italian restaurant and bar. Those will be nice. The river and marina too. Those are ok (my family doesn't have a boat so I can't talk much on those). Other than that, nothing. You have to go to Nashville for any entertainment, but you can't drive to Nashville at any time without having people going 100 on the interstate. Our city is a place for people either in the military or business people who work in Nashville to be able to live cheaper. We're literally a college town with a high population college and 0 things to do for students.

Ignore what that other person said about expanding. We will never expand. It's impossible with the way everything is setup. Everything is so clustered together with no room to expand, unless they want to expand on the city borders which will help absolutely nothing.

Forget driving anywhere at 2 in the afternoon or basically anytime on Saturday on the main roads. There is so much traffic and Clarksville is filled with, pardon my language, stupid fucking drivers. Cutting you off, don't know where they're going despite living here for years, etc. Any ""back roads"" are just raceways for the tiny dick sports cars and overly suped-up trucks. Even the main roads. I've seen them race past people in the turn lanes, and the police couldn't care less. Also, no one knows how to park.

There are really no good schools. Even the Clarksville academy private school isn't that great. There are so many ignorant ass holes that they teach their kids to be ignorant ass holes and it ruins all of the schools.

Like I just said. There are so many selfish ass holes in this town. Everyone is for themselves. The people are just rude. Period.

I'm not sure of your political affiliation, but everyone here are old, conservative Christians who will follow and praise Trump if he led them to their deaths, preaching the holy Bible all the way. We aren't called the Bible belt for no reason.

Remember what I said about being clustered up? That's our housing situation too. Clump every house together and skyrocket the price, because people will still buy it. In cash, even. It sucks for new home-owners.

If I missed anything feel free to ask. But that's most of it I feel.


Edit: I must say, I've lived here my entire life and I turn 23 this year. This city used to be way better. It's slowly depreciated over the years. I'm not sure why we keep getting ranked top ten or even number one in places to live in the US. It's not that great. The only appealing qualities is we're close to Ft.

"Clarksville Athletics Club is an option. It has a family plan, day care (so does crunch), a pool (indoor and out), strength training classes (as well as a ton of others), an indoor track, upstairs and downstairs with various areas targeting specific themes (cardio, weights, machines, etc), an indoor basketball court, indoor theater, a sauna. When I was a member, a family of 4 was about 80 a month. So it can be pricey imo.

I ended my membership for one main reason, however. My workout style is primarily powerlifting so I do compound exercises every workout. When I was a member (about a year ago now), they only had 2 squat racks and 2 deadlift platforms. I think I saw one Smith machine. And i want to say there was 3 flat benches? So as you can imagine, it was frustrating to plan your workout program for the week or even the day due to the amount of people. Also, let me emphasize the amount of people. It will do nothing to help anxiety. I'll add, I've heard they've done some renovations and either moved some stuff around or added more to the gym. You'll have to get a current member to confirm that. But all in all, this is my favorite gym in town just because it offers so much. I haven't been to crunch, but I've been a member at Battleground. It's a super clean gym but it's a Christian gym. Not that that matters. But they play Christian radio over the speakers there and I always feel uncomfortable saying ""bad words.""

"Welcome to the fucked up pay situation for a lot of mechanics. Some guys expect gravy jobs they can flag an easy 2.5 or 3 hours on all day long, and get each done in about 45 minutes .

Regardless, i have no idea if that's actually what happened. All i know is that I've seen it before where a lazy mechanic decides that a rotate isn't worth his time since it pays so little (Flat rate). Or who knows, the tires could have indicated the same treadwear front and rear, which would surprise me at 6k miles but, i guess if it's all highway mileage and the tires are a harder compound then it's certainly possible.

If i was still working in that field and I had a vehicle come in for an LOF(Oil change) + Rotate and when I checked the tires with my tread depth gauge and all of the tires read the same amount of wear, I would recommend to not rotate at that time. Now if your drive wheels (lets say front wheel drive since that's the most prevalant nowadays) measure out at like 7/32 and your rears at 8/32, then yeah. Totally rotate them. That's worth doing. But if they're the same wear *or* the fronts  have 8/32 and the rears have 7/32, then realistically from a tire longevity standpoint they shouldn't be rotated.

"Not to be ""that guy"", but i'll preface this by saying I worked as a mechanic at Toyota, Mazda, and an independent shop in the Nashville area... 

Whenever I had a vehicle come in for a service I knew that it did not need/ warrant, I would always bring it up to the service writer before performing it. Most of the time we got happy customers when I told them that they didn't need a rotate, others I was told to do anyways. Most of the time when i said it didn't need an alignment, it was due to the drive wheels already having the tires with the most tread left on them... Just trying to help the customer stretch their tire life.

 Same thing with alignments, if I saw no evidence of uneven wear, no complaints of a pull while driving, and a centered out steering wheel i'd usually get the service writer to talk to the customer about it. And, if at the end of the day the service was requested to still be done, i'd do it. That means I get paid for it, i just don't want people to be out money for no practical reason.

However if you get charged for a service and it wasn't performed, then that's a whole other subject of at best simple negligence or at worst, shady business practices.

Infact i got into a shouting match once with a service writer who wrote up an RO on a vehicle to check the tires for needing an alignment. I went on record, detailing everything i saw of how it didn't need that service. The writer still told the customer the car needed it and I proceeded to fly a bit off the handle (Service writers, like mechanics, are paid by commision).",t2_3mwkknow,Aviate_Anime,0,1647892281.0,0,t1_i1kkm5w,i1kkm5w,False,Umbra29,t3_tje590,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clarksville/comments/tje590/wyatt_johnson_subaru_mechanics/,Wyatt Johnson Subaru mechanics,/r/Clarksville/comments/tje590/wyatt_johnson_subaru_mechanics/i1kkm5w/,3,r/Clarksville,0,3

I used to live in the townhouses down tiny town a short drive from all of the business down there and now next to a strip mall. It was awful trying to leave and go anywhere. I would almost get hit just trying to turn into the area. Now I live on Needmore and they've somehow crammed even more over here. The zone changes on East Boyscout Rd (going down to Billy Dunlop park) is ridiculous... the road isn't even wide enough for all of these apartments. When the event center and that 3 level restaurant opens up it'll be a nightmare to go downtown or to Riverside. The town planning is truly awful here.

"Yeah. I don't believe half of that for a second, but I also haven't done any in-depth research on it. But I definitely feel like there is a profit from gas, or else no one would want to be in the business.

Actually, EV batteries have gotten a lot better. Some can last 8-10 years and definitely do not cost $20k. It can if you have a dealership trying to scam you, but the vast majority of the time it'll cost $10k-15k or less. Every 8 or 10 years? I say that's not terrible, since most people spend more than that on engine repair/oil changes/basic engine maintenance. Plus, you save a ton on gas cause electricity costs less.

Perhaps you should do some research and take your own advice. Stop believing the bullshit agenda that conservative, gas lovers are feeding you. Do some real, in-depth research like I did.

"Short answer is, people wanted out of the oil market because they predicted oil companies were going to not make as much money as their other investment options.

&#x200B;

Truly, it's complicated.  The market is unpredictable and based on consumer sentiment and opinions and guesses, and one day is hardly enough time to measure any of that anyway.

&#x200B;

But rising oil prices does not equal rising oil profits, especially when you are cut off from the primary source of new oil deposits... new federal leases, and cut off from any expansion of your pipelines.  Removing Russia seems good for American oil companies, but not if there's nowhere to get any additional oil to meet the demand.

"i've fixed my PS3 countless times back when COD4 was still poppin'. It's not that hard of a fix tbh, and you can do it yourself. You'll need to learn (youtube) how to open up your PS3 and get to the motherboard. You'll need to apply some thermal paste to the CPU. That's all it is, thermal paste on your CPU. That's what fixed mine numerous times. It's like a 10$ fix and an hour of your time.

"Austin Pray is a decent mid-size campus. You won't have much trouble walking to classes. The campus is pretty safe. Yes, there are areas of town that are seedier than others. It won't take long to learn where to avoid. It is a city experiencing a growth surge due to the proximity of Nashville. There is no state income tax in Tennessee which draws a lot of people. Fort Campbell straddles the Kentucky/Tennessee border. A single person will be able to find things to do here, but despite having like 23 elementary schools there really isn't a lot here for families. There is a decent bus transit system uptown. If you need a car, buy it before you come here. Having all of the young soldiers with money means car prices are high here. The weather is good, generally. Very little snow. Some black ice to learn to be aware of. There are several city pools open during the summer. Your car will last you twice as long here because you won't have to deal with road salt.

"I am already working full time in the industry and do not have much time to spare BUT I can provide some advice. Once you finish feecodecamp go to udemy and purchase a masters course using a first time coupon in your chosen language (It should end up like 8.99-11.99 US, well worth it). Be sure it includes object oriented programming. Also be sure you understand git and versioning.  If you finish the master's course and the associated projects, you will be ready to build whatever.  I also highly recommend a deep review of [https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) as it will convey the gang of four patterns needed for the big time efforts.

"There’s a lot, but the short answer is that the builder is garbage, everyone was in everyone else’s business, parents are letting their kids run wild (many families stopped going to the playground on Mutual because of how awful some of those unsupervised teenagers were acting). As an example, they were setting fires, destroying playground equipment, trying to break into houses (caught on doorbell cams), and one girl (probably about 12 or 13) flashed a bunch of adult men while the playground was packed with kids and their parents.

And the drama. We’ve lived a lot of places, but that neighborhood is legitimately THE most drama filled place we’ve ever been. It was exhausting. 

The neighborhood looks pretty nice from the outside, but the feel changes entirely once you’ve moved in. A lot of people are jumping ship for many of the same reasons.

"Fellow outdoorsman here and the reason your dad is saying this is because it WAS true in the past. Fishing with live bait meant no license and then I believe it became fishing with worms meant  no license and that finally became you need a license no matter what.

"Fort Donelson out in Dover has absolutely beautiful views of the river and some really cool artifacts. It’s also very serene and peaceful.  It’s a great way to get lost for an afternoon.  

We like Dunbar Cave to take a quick walk through. The trails are really nice. 

The Riverwalk is hit or miss depending on the time of day. Seems like after 4-5 PM the sewage smell becomes more aromatic.  I usually get a great whiff driving home from work every night around 5:15-5:20. 

The City Forum is a lot of fun.  And bonus it’s indoors so if the weather doesn’t cooperate you can still have a blast. 

Edward’s is really nice for dinner just make sure to make a reservation. Ms. Linda will make sure everything on your visit is perfect, she’s a saint of a woman, so kind and gracious.  We also really like P’body’s at the Clarksville Country Club. It’s super casual, the food is amazing and the staff treat you like family. Perry and Angie are absolutely the best!

"I'm sorry about that! That's pretty much what happened at my job too, I'll see their Facebook posts but we don't talk. 
And I understand that about approaching people.
Do you have the next door app or Facebook? If you have the next door app (where you can connect with people in your neighborhood) you can post an introduction or ask for things to do where you can meet people! I've seen people do that on there. Also on Facebook there's this group called Clarksville chat. If you can sift through the stupid (some people on there are really rude or do everything they can to talk bad about Clarksville) then you can meet nice people sometimes! I found out about a writers group that way, but you could also ask about activities or clubs/groups, and see if you can get any ideas or meet anyone there.
I also just remembered this app called hey vina. It's like bumble but for making friends. It's not super popular but it may be helpful!

I would recommend you look in to going to school, whether you have a degree already or not. On a college campus, it is really easy to make friends, and taking a class is something you can do anywhere. Find something you want to learn and look for classes at APSU, a language a writing class whatever. You could work towards a degree, or just do it for fun.

"Walking around downtown on Franklin and Strawberry Ave can be fun! Plenty of nice restaurants and coffee options, you can see the massive developing event center, Journeys Eye Studio is an official welcome center for Clarksville and usually has a freebie for kids or a refreshment of some sort along with really good people and an eclectic mix of items, Fanelli's Deli has the BEST CANNOLIS I've ever had, the Downtown Commons may or may not have ice skating or yard toys out considering the weather but it's a nice open area for kids to romp around for a little bit. The local museum is also downtown and the kids area should be reopening soon if you want to stick to indoor activities. I think downtown is about 7 miles from The City Forum arcade/bowling/mini golf/laser tag that others have mentioned which is also attached to Miss Lucille's, a massive indoor antique and handcrafted marketplace with coffee and a cafe. Mochas and Minis just opened on Tiny Town Rd. where kids can play on their indoor playground for like $15 while adults sip coffee and chat. I also agree that Silkes is amazing, their cheesecake is my favorite and the meat and cheese plate and pizzas are so tasty. We also often get bread to go. People all over the US order her bread, it's that good. The shops attached to Silkes are fun to browse too if you're into antiques. If y'all like pizza and want to do a pizza night, Woody's or Michaels are my fave local pizza joints. The catfish house is a great family eatery but be sure to check the website for hours and plan accordingly... Some days they only do dinner hours. Golly G's is a local ice cream and baked goods shop, their cinnamon rolls are as big as your face. At Exit 4 there is a Blacklight Mini Golf that has been there awhile now, it's not my thing because it hurts my eyes but I'm sure kids would love it.

"I second Novadell and Torino’s if you’re looking to drive your out of town guests around so they see a bit more than just Clarksville. Both are a bit of a drive, depending on where you are in Clarksville, but completely worth it.

They do flavored foam and it’s to die for! Mugsy’s has great lattes. The beans are roasted on site and they have them available for purchase. Both are veteran owned. My next last recommendation is for Silke’s. It’s a German café, deli and bakery and they’re coffee is great. I get the iced Turtle. They’re food is amazing. I get the meat and cheese plate.

"Revel House does open mic nights on Tuesday at 8. Bands come in and play. Everything from a single artist with a guitar, to full groups. All genres.

I go with some friends and hang out. It's a pretty chill time with a mix of crowds. It doesn't get too crazy, which is more my speed since I'm in my 30s. I hear there's larger crowds though on Wednesday night and on weekends. 

There's games and open areas to get to talk and meet people.
