"It's not about me being offended,  I just called it like I saw it.  It was just so strange how you came out of the gate in attack mode with this person.  First, a Paragraphs long comment about the housing crisis in this town, that the OP is obviously well aware of, was not helpful. 

 When she responded that she was aware of the housing issues with some slight sarcasm, you wrote a second, even longer comment.  You lectured her, and rudely insulted her, calling her ""incel"", and rudely asserted no one would want to live with her.  For unknown reasons you seem to have a deep seated hostility towards her, it made no sense.  Also, exclaiming ""OK boomer"", which is usually funny, but in this case was rude.  

Then you created a whole new post to complain about this poster, and  how Reddit should not be used to find housing.

"I totally get it. There’s shitty people everywhere. I’ve been a toxic person, still dabble sometimes…not speaking for or about anyone with or without any of the thousands of reasons toxic people become toxic, but sometimes they don’t even know. Have you ever pissed someone off and never even knew it? If not, you’re lying to yourself or perhaps less than aware than you might think.

Yup, your guy probably should know if someone’s trying to blacklist him from making a living because he’s mean…what’s the end game btw? are you or someone in this group going to challenge him to a duel because he’s hard to work with or pisses off customers? 

Don’t hire him at the restaurants you own and you’ll never have to deal. Easy right. 🤦‍♂️

Maybe the guy’s had a rough go lately, or worse, for a long time. It’s easy to get toxic if things don’t go your way long enough, especially when toxicity is a (literally toxic) coping mechanism for people who’ve suffered a lot in their life.

Anyway. I know “this person” and “you” not because I have any idea who you’re trying to do whatever it is you think this will accomplish, but because we all know people like both of you. You’re equally hard to work with for vastly different reasons. 

You can fire someone for being toxic outwardly though. People like you just think you’re doing a good deed. There’s a lot of things to unpack in your post that mostly say that you are doing this thing instead of dealing with a you thing that this person triggers.

An extreme example presented strictly to point out your cognitive dissonance…I’m hesitant because using something so culture shaping in our US history of brutalizing black people just for being black, but…

You’re basically rounding up a posse to go burn a cross or perhaps lynch a person because YOU,. personally. Don’t think this person belongs in the community where you choose to exist. What color hoods will your Righteous Restaurant Liberation crew wear? 

Seen/ read Fight Club? It’s not a stretch that this is your foray into policing the bad guys yourself. No one is Norton OR Pitt…we’re all both. You’re allowing this person to trigger you and choosing to literally “deal with” the types of people you don’t like instead of dealing with yourself and figuring out what you can do about your life and why a bad employee in your circles is causing you this reaction. Hint: it’s not him.

That’s all I got. Maybe the guy just needs someone to tell him he’s a complete ass hole in the best of ways and extend a branch. Maybe he’s lonely and his life sucks…if you don’t know anyone who’s circling the drain an hates life because they’d rather check out, you should get to know your friends and family better…it will change you if you let it. 

I’ve Bibled enough to know that most who preach religion and feel devout wouldn’t recognize this as an opportunity to turn the other cheek if the God guy reached out of the heaven place and slapped them in the face himself. 

There’s also only a thousand other restaurants to work for, but if you think the world is so small that this toxic fellow is so widely known you fear your identity might be revealed in a community of 300,000 people then your delusions might be clouding your view of the reality we all live in.",t2_608cgmbv,spindlecork,0,1649005315.0,0,t1_i38rflu,i38rflu,True,AreaServer,t3_tv7emx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/comments/tv7emx/toxic_people_in_food_service/,Toxic people in Food service,/r/Eugene/comments/tv7emx/toxic_people_in_food_service/i38rflu/,4,r/Eugene,0,4

"A friend of mine told me to post here. 

 Copy of the text from Facebook: 

Eugene, I am extremely excited to announce another edition of Eric Sparks and Friends. 

This time around I’ve invited six of my favorite comics from Salem and six local comics from Eugene (I can’t say favorite because I love everybody here) to perform in back to back showcases on April 6th at Sam Bond's Garage starting at 8pm. The purpose behind these shows is to highlight the talent working hard to make a name for themselves in the comedy industry right here in the local communities of Oregon. 

All of the comedians on these shows have impressed me, not only with their jokes, but with their commitment to comedy and their kind, decent attitudes. I am honored to have an opportunity to showcase their skill.
 
Sam Bond’s Garage is a rustic bar with an intimate atmosphere that is perfect for comedy. We will be telling jokes for three hours. Please come by for as much or as little time as you would like. My goal is simply to create the best opportunity I can for my friends and a fun, funny environment for the people of Eugene. 
    
*Vaccine cards are required to attend this show*

$5 cover. Thank you for supporting local comedy! We can’t do it without you!

"By that logic, the penalty for texting while walking should be the same as texting while driving. A distracted walker might get hit by a car, and the driver would then deal with guilt. 

Yes, I do think before I post and I stand by my statement. A distracted cyclist poses little risk to others. Cars kill pedestrians about every 90 minutes in our country. Bicycles kill pedestrians so rarely that there aren't any meaningful statistics. The penalty and price of a moving violation should be based on risk, and the reality is that a distracted cyclist is orders of magnitude less risky than a distracted driver. The penalty should not be equal.

"Like. I can’t remember a time I was offered a petition that wasn’t for a ballot measure or otherwise related directly to and therefor a very important part of our democratic process. Sick of democracy in action. Amazing stuff.

You exemplify exactly why we are where we are. Everyone bitches about the government and the one thing that rings true (even though it never really has been) is that it’s in our hands and they work for us. Do you realize that the causes that require groundwork like petition drives are almost exclusively for the items most popular with and specifically aimed at helping the people who live where the drives are happening? They’re also almost always the ones the corporations and people in current power are trying to keep off the ballot. Seriously. Corpco can legally bribe and otherwise has means (like manipulative ads) because they have bottomless pockets. The folks trying to initiate systemic changes at the local level don’t have bottomless pockets…and when they do get a little chunk from somewhere it’s scrutinized far more than the dark billions that are the problems. 

Isn’t it acting locally that people always say will make the biggest impact for you personally because the changes are at home? Have you ever criticized the government/ process? Then you should be paying attention to those petitioners unless you think we’re at a great place in the way of societal direction locally, regionally, and on a national level. 

Perhaps instead of getting triggered for having to see or heaven forbid engage with another human in the real world who is literally out there doing an essential job in our society that directly improves our community regardless of whether their specific bill/ cause doesn’t garner the signatures/ attention it needs you should just stfu and let people who give a shit about our community a break. Go walk elsewhere.

Since I can’t remember the last time I ran into a person who’s never complained about our state of affairs, I’m going to assume you complain too…safe bet? Do you find any irony in the fact you’re complaining about perhaps the most direct way you can have an impact in your own community by doing quite literally next to nothing…Voting fits here too for you idiots that don’t do that. 

Right now the freedom party is so bent on nationalist ideas and freedumbs like mandates that they’ve been blindly supporting the blatant removal of our freedoms in favor of the very police state idea they use to spread the fear that gets republican votes these days. How can you take a political base seriously when a vaccine is a tracking device and we’re doomed if we get it, but at the same time pay Verizon $100 a month then make monthly payments to lock you into a contract for two years on a tracking device you’ll pay $1000 for that also gives them your whole life and contact tree since day on. Gaslighting and propaganda are killing us and the people who think they’re the patriots and protectors of freedoms are the ones giving it all away. That Brandon guy who’s party has easily drifted into the neo-conservative right of center space they’ve been waiting for since Rush and Newt started pushing the GQP right under Reagan is probably feeling stoked they haven’t actually had to put into play any of the progressive carrots they had to dangle to pull it off in 2020. 

What an absurd thing to get triggered over. Also, you can just say I’m not registered to vote here and 99% of the time you’re off the hook instantly. 🤦‍♂️",t2_608cgmbv,spindlecork,0,1648944054.0,0,t1_i361xqd,i361xqd,True,DairyFact0ry,t3_tus27n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/comments/tus27n/whats_up_with_all_the_petitioners_in_town/,What's up with all the petitioners in town?,/r/Eugene/comments/tus27n/whats_up_with_all_the_petitioners_in_town/i361xqd/,11,r/Eugene,0,11

"I’m sorry, explain these “civilizations contingent rules” when I just said my coworker, who is working a job in the health care field, is living in a tent under a bridge. …?  Does that not constitute living by societies standards ???   I’d love to know what civilized contingent rules I’m missing here other than being a law abiding citizen with a job ….  & while I am not in a position to offer all of my belongings, Which was not at all in the conversation because that would mean it’s being put on small people, which I had already stated is the cruel part. Maybe you didn’t read that far before responding with your two cents. 
I am a special education teacher who can hardly afford her own rent.. if I gave away my things and belongings, I too would not have a way to get to my job or have a bed ? Or a roof?    My belongings are fairly minimalist as I cannot afford many luxurious things if I wish to keep my housing ?    
So I’m not entirely sure why you’re calling me heartless for not being able to afford to help others?
And It’s a pretty drastic thing to request from another struggling with homelessness herself ????  

And that is where my comment started & ended with it’s not the job of the small people, there is a bigger problem at hand that can’t be fixed with “just get a job”. I work full time and am searching for additional part time because rent is higher than minimum wage, and only drastically getting worse might I add. 
So.  If you have any other bright ideas that don’t entail me selling my desk, bed, and my cat, please, do share. If not, 🤷🏽‍♀️ your hypothetical philosophical idea of selling all of our belongings to help the poor is a fantastic idea and I applaud it, but for that to work, everyone would have to reevaluate what their values are. (Also the divvying up wealth appropriately is basically socialism….) 

I can make the argument that if everyone sold their macbooks or never bought one to begin with, you could literally save thousands in Africa from malaria since it costs 1$ for a malaria shot. 


Is that happening?  No.     Could it happen and benefit the majority? Yes absolutely.

"Well… fully capable adults if they weren’t suffering from mental health disorders and other ailments.  
People become homeless , and it’s not always because they don’t have a job, my old coworker when I was working in the health care field, asked if I could give her a ride to her place.  Her place was a tent under a bridge….  A. Coworker. Someone who was working the same hours as me, but also had a multitude of other set backs (bad ex partner that stole her money and credit cards, health problems and not able to afford medical bills, has mental health problems, depression, fatigue, whatever else) 
As much as I agree we have a homeless problem and little to no solution, bitching and moaning about how we can’t use side walks just baffles me when they are at rock bottom and nowhere to go.  
Something as simple as insulin (costing someone still up to 500$ even when insurance covers it!), like that’s a fat portion of my rent? If I had diabetes, I doubt I’d be able to healthily work MORE than 40 hours a week in order to pay for my medication…. 
Just sucks that this blame is being put on the small people, on the people who are struggling severely that they have no choose but to liiiiive on the streeeeet.  Like how bad must life be for you to have no other option but the street? Do we think they’re living luxuriously? 
As rent is going up to accommodate wealthy college kids, and wages are just bs, i foresee an influx in houselessness and it’ll be the common folks like you and I using Reddit at 7am in their comfy beds with heat and whatever else going on. My rent is 1250$ and I work full time as a teacher for kids with autism and I am applying for part time jobs because I can’t afford rent.

At this point long story short about 10 more minutes and a few more 911 calls later, the cops do finally see the guy and sit him down on the sidewalk. They spent about 5 or so minutes talking to him then let him walk away. Didn't even wait for him to get to the street corner before they drove off and out of sight.

That link will give you some of your options. I've been a couple years before covid. 

Darlings is highly recommended but there's a LONG waitlist to be ""invited"" to camp there. You can visit it at night and tour people's camps. It's quite fun. 

Quiet camp is most family friendly that I've seen. Somewhat self explanatory. 

Your best best (and from my experience) is Shady Rest. It's right across the street from OCF and they have DJ's and what not going on well into the night. I'm not a raver but I'd consider it pretty wild. It does feel like an exercise in living in squalor though - especially by the last day.

I haven't been or heard much about the others.

No matter where you go, you'll probably want to arrive EARLY on Thursday to stand a chance at getting a decent campsite. Places like Shady are absolutely packed to the max and there's places you don't want to camp in there (mosquito hotspots, swampy, etc).

"On the issue mentioned in the comments:

I think a lot of people stop short when they hear “defund police” because they don’t understand that it means - take the BILLIONS of dollars that go to the police (with all evidence pointing to police hindering communities more than helping them) and put said funds to programs/people/systems that would actually address and solve the issues. It includes looking at our current systems and giving them a complete overhaul. 

Our current justice system is the definition of insanity. A broken system that is perpetually corrupt, inefficient, costing and wasting tax payers billions, instilling terrorist tactics on civilians at will, works solely for the rich as easily seen in tickets, fines, fees, and cash bail, with disproportionate laws built on suppression and oppression of society, etc etc etc. 

I believe most people hear “defund the police” and think It means absolute chaos and murder in the streets but they don’t know the very real facts such as that so far this year we haven’t even gone 30 days without someone being killed by the police in this nation. Gang activity ranging in all of the worst criminal activity is very real within many police forces.

"I can understand that sentiment when you see all the abuse and neglect by police officers. However, it's also a fact that increasing police presence reduces serious crime, and also reduces arrests (as it's a deterrent). Research shows that for the average city, hiring 10-17 police officers saves one life per year, and that life saved is twice as likely to be Black as White.

"This thread is heartbreaking, honestly. Policing in this country needs major reform, that's for sure. But it's complicated. There are good cops, there are terrible cops. Their racial prejudices (sometimes conscious, sometimes unconscious) come out in stressful situations, which are especially stressful because they are so poorly trained. (Did you know they have about 1/6th the training of a cosmetologist or plumber?) They are more likely than the general population to be abusive.

ALSO:

Crime generally goes down with more police presence. (10-17 new police officers saves one life per year.) And the lives saved by increased policing are twice as likely to be Black as White.

50% of Black people favor hiring more police officers. (It was higher before George Floyd's murder.)

It's complicated. I've seen cops totally mistreat people, and I've also seen police do good and show restraint and wisdom, such as when I used to work for a crisis mental health program and we'd work with them frequently. I don't know what the solution is, but surely comments like ACAB aren't contributing anything.

"I was talking to a 911 operator outside my work in downtown Portland once about a disheveled elderly homeless guy swinging a big screwdriver at passersby. The operator and I had an actual debate (while this loon was wildly swinging the screwdriver) about whether the screwdriver was actually a weapon. The sad thing is that crime is so bad in Portland that I *almost* saw where she was coming from, and that the screwdriver wasn't really much of a weapon. You'd have to be really slow or have zero street smarts to get stabbed by this homeless guy. But is that part of the societal social contract? Is walking down the street ""almost"" getting stabbed by a screwdriver the new norm? I guess so. 

The homeless guy ended up throwing the screwdriver into a Taco Bell parking lot, and that was that. ""So, it's been resolved?"" the operator asked. ""Yes,"" I said.

No trash can. No comfort. There’s no reason to blame people on the streets for being on the streets. Even if there is a reason ask yourself “will this help or treat the problem?” Or are you just verbally masturbating because you have no idea what to do? Imagine you’re out in the street. For whatever reason. And I promise it can happen to anyone. There’s only going to be more in the years ahead. Might be you out there. THEY NEED A ROOM TO LIVE IN. Period.

"I'm sure there are good cops, but I have never had a good experience with one, and I'm a middle class, cis white man. So if these are my experiences with the police than I can only assume some people's are a lot worse:

* Last time I called the cops was on a couple of dudes driving down coburg during rush hour traffic while one hung out the passenger side window pointing his gun at people so that they could merge. This was a good 30 seconds away from the police station on country club. These guys slowly drove through traffic while aiming at peoples heads. The police never showed up even though it took the guys 5 minutes to get through. The police were banging on my door at 2am that night (this event happened at \~1:00pm) to ""see if I wanted to press charges"" and said they were not able to track down the vehicle and it was registered to somebody in brownsville so there wasn't much they could do ""but they'd try"".
* A couple weeks ago an unhoused person was pumping up his bike tire in front of our office, he wasn't doing anything wrong, I'm pretty sure one of the guys who bikes to work actually gave him the pump to use. A Karen from my office called the cops ""because she felt threatened"" and the cops pulled up not 2 minutes later demanding he leave.
* My buddy from highschools dad was a high ranking (or whatever they call it) officer for eugene, he sexually assaulted a girl while drunk, on duty, and at a bar, in full police attire. Dude (somehow) got off with an apology and retained his position. It was actually worse for my buddy because the whole school knew about it.

So to summarize my view of cops; they can get away with sexual assault in public while working and don't have to respond to a call about a possible shooting but will respond quickly if an unhoused man is pumping up his bike tire. I'm not saying there shouldn't be cops, but maybe only allow cops who are normal people and not just looking to inflate their ego every day? Maybe cops need to have consequences for their actions?",t2_u2x90nf,braed13,0,1648839038.0,0,t1_i30n88i,i30n88i,False,awakebutverypuzzled,t3_ttvhi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eugene/comments/ttvhi1/police_response_time/,Police Response Time,/r/Eugene/comments/ttvhi1/police_response_time/i30n88i/,110,r/Eugene,0,110

What he said (in a relatively rough way) remains true though; the police are not, and have never been, responsible for your immediate personal safety. Only YOU are. That has been true for all time, in all countries and cultures, and will always be true.

If that's a responsibility you don't want, then it's on you to flee any and all dangerous situations, which, to be fair, a lot of people should do. Most people don't want to be in a gun fight or fist fight. Some people choose to arm themselves or otherwise prepare for the possibility of violence, which doesn't equate to seeking it.
