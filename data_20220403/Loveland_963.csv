"My sister has lived at Peakview by Horseshoe lake for several years. It was very nice when she moved in, but it is now showing a lot of wear because they really don't do much upkeep. 

When it snows, they let the spots between the cars just pile up. This is where I would want the most attention as it makes it very difficult to get in and out of your vehicle without falling on the ice after snow is left to accumulate over days and sometimes even weeks in the shade between the cars.

They recently started a ""trash valet"" service and it is not optional. Everyone's rent was increased for this service that most people don't care for. It's only a 40ft walk for my sister to take her own trash to the dumpster. 

She said they do fix things fairly quickly when something like her heat goes out. But she says they are a little slow to fix other things that are not as important such as the microwave. 

She's been wanting to leave for a long time, but the requirements to break the lease are expensive, plus you must give a lengthy notice (I believe she said 60 days) if you are leaving at the end of your lease so it makes it difficult if you don't already have a new place lined up. Part of why she wants to leave is because there are much larger single family homes with big garages that rent for the same amount as what she pays for her apartment.

I wish I had a good recommendation for what you are looking for. I do know an incredible and honest landlord named Ashley McDaniels. She is a real estate agent in Timnath. But I don't know if she has anything that meets your needs. Also, you will likely have to get on a waiting list for her rentals because so many of us previous tenants are always trying to come back to her.",t2_pj6xw,glo363,0,1648925607.0,0,t1_i34zwo7,i34zwo7,True,thomas_powell,t3_tuomj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveland/comments/tuomj8/peakview_by_horseshoe_lake_and_other_townhome/,"Peakview by Horseshoe Lake, and other Townhome Community Suggestions?",/r/loveland/comments/tuomj8/peakview_by_horseshoe_lake_and_other_townhome/i34zwo7/,2,r/loveland,0,2

"Colorado was the first state to overturn drug laws responsible for mass incarceration of non-violent individuals.

Colorado has numerous social programs directed at breaking the cycle of poverty and the violence it begets.

Colorado ended qualified immunity last year, a pivotal step in police reformation.

Loveland has a community response team in addition to armed police.

The Loveland Police Chief that was responsible for the department for the last six years has resigned.

Meaningful change is a slow course correction, Colorado and Loveland are doing a much better job than many other parts of the country.

I think most state and city residents recognize our work isn’t yet done in rewriting unjust laws and ferreting out bad actors within our state and city politics, and law enforcement.

"Psst. I love watching FPV flying and all and It looks like you are having a lot of fun. However, you should really consider taking down this and your other videos on YouTube before you get into legal trouble with the FAA or other agency. 

At minimum you need to be registered if your drone weighs over .55Lb. Which judging by how stable your footage is and it being a DJI, unless it’s a “mini” you would fall over that weight. 


Make sure you are up to date on what is and isn’t legal and take a course so you can legally fly. 
https://uavcoach.com/drone-laws-colorado/#

I assume you haven’t taken a course as In almost all your videos you fly over a street with moving vehicles and lose visual line of sight which are both prohibited by FAA guidelines (FPV DOES NOT COUNT AS VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT). Not to mention drones flying around while driving can be extremely distracting to a driver.

"Okay, so you expect me to believe that you were the very best that your generation of Navy SEALs had to offer? I highly doubt that. If you were as good as you say you were, i don't think for a second that you would be browsing reddit. This is mostly a place for jobless neckbeards that still live with their parents, and nerdy high school kids that don't have any friends. It really isn't the place for highly-trained assassins to be hanging out in their spare time. Even if it was, something far worse than a troll being mean to you probably would have set you off a long time ago. What about the slew of gore and child pornography that gets posted here on a regular basis? Isn't that something that deserves a person being hunted down and made to regret their actions? Yeah, you're just not the reddit type. Sure, there's a wide variety of people that browse here, but you're far from the core demographic if you are who you say you are (which isn't the case). Even if it were true that you're an incredibly talented soldier, I think all the military discipline would prevent you from getting mad enough to murder some random idiot on the internet. I also doubt that even the best SEALs have a 'secret network of spies across the USA'. Why would all of the most expanisive Big Brother network in the world be willing to help a troubled PTSD-sufferer hunt down some random kid on the internet? That doesn't even make sense. If you're gonna try to scare somebody make it more believable than 'IM A SUPER SOLDIER HURR DURR'.

"Just FYI, your address will determine your ""home"" school.  You can apply to attend any of the other schools (even in a different district), but you are not guaranteed to be accepted - it only happens if there is room, and if there are more applicants than there is room there's a priority/lottery system.

I wouldn't say that there are any high schools to ""stay away"" from.  It really just depends on what you are interested in.  One more in-district option you should be aware of - Berthoud High is also part of the same district as Loveland, Thompson Valley, Mountain View, and Ferguson. 

(That said, Berthoud is unique in that there are just two elementary schools that feed into one middle school, and just the one middle school feeds into the high school.  So in many cases, you've got kids who've been going to school together since kindergarten, which can make it a bit cliquey.)",t2_xlh2z,RockyMtnPapaBear,0,1646016384.0,0,t1_hyq8sn6,hyq8sn6,True,underspare,t3_swij9w,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveland/comments/swij9w/questions_about_loveland_high_schools/,Questions about Loveland High Schools,/r/loveland/comments/swij9w/questions_about_loveland_high_schools/hyq8sn6/,2,r/loveland,0,2

"Loveland high was kinda a waste.  When I went we had a mouse problem, the school was always falling apart, and we were hemorrhaging science and math teachers. School lunches were worse then most places. The school really never had enough teachers to go around and the ones we did were not great. They tried to find every way to fill our credit requirements without actually teaching us. I started going to the community college by the junior year almost full time because they didn’t have enough math/science teachers for all of us. The band is pretty cool if you like being busy every day but Sunday from like June-late Oct and have to fund raise like crazy because we never had enough money to go around.

For food it’s of course a blend of Mexican and Irish options. You can find Reubens, Irish Nachos (my favorite), quesadillas, burritos, plus a variety of other dishes. There will also be fried options like fish n chips in the future once the new fryer is up and running!

"Not OP, but we stopped by on Saturday, and beer-wise it's a mix of crafts (both local and non) and a good selection of Irish and Mexican beers on tap and bottled. There's also a full bar. For food we just needed a snack so I didn't look too hard at the entree part of the menu, but I remember seeing sandwiches, tacos, and both Irish and standard nachos (which were delicious). Price-wise they were pretty reasonable, probably on par with other casual spots downtown. 

Right now they've got it set up where you order at the bar, take a number and they bring the food to you, not sure if they'll go to a more full service model as they get up and running. Atmosphere-wise, I'm not sure how to describe it. If you'd ever been when it was the Laureate, it's all the same darker wood furniture, but with some of the new art (and maybe time of day we went) it felt brighter inside.  Maybe it will have more of a sports-bar feel when there are bigger games to watch (and there are plenty of TVs for it).

"The usual opinions of the high schools, or accepted generalizations, are: Loveland HS=uppity rich families, good football and marching band, and very crowded. Mountain View=artsy, good culinary program, Thompson Valley=more of the country/farm kids, maybe more friendly.

Keep in mind the TSD tech campus at Van Buren/Eisenhower. It has really good programs for nursing, design, manufacturing, etc.  Once you enroll as a tsd student you are able to attend there and its like getting a community College/tech school education at no cost. People are certified in a variety of things when they finish their 2 years there. You also have the option, regardless of where you attend, of staying enrolled as a tsd student after graduation and then attending front range community College (is maybe Aims, but I want to say FR) while the district pays for your tuition.

"Not sure if Loveland or Larimer county has permit requirements around short-term rentals, but just search for “larimer county short-term rental” and you’ll find a bunch of links to the county website on the topic.

Also, I believe that the laws with respect to tenant rights change after 30 days. So 30 days or less and it’s considered a short-term rental. More than 30 days and standard tenant laws kick in. There are probably nuances associated with that (like lease length etc.), but I’ve never had to deal with it directly so I don’t know all the details.

Finally, I believe the laws for “long-term” rental will vary depending on if you’re living in the space/it’s your own primary residence.

I like Loveland the best of all three, though admittedly i haven't spent a lot of time in Longmont. Loveland is in my opinion flying under the radar. Low traffic, lots to do and slightly lower housing prices. Loveland also does a great job valuing the arts.

"Loveland is the sweet spot in my opinion. You could pay less to love there and work in any of your 3 options without a bogus commute.

15-25 minute drive to Fort Collins and you don't pay nearly as much for a house or deal with the traffic and college kids as much.

The train that runs on Mason in Fort Collins is worth considering when analyzing travel paths. It can easily add 10-30 minutes once or twice a week if your route calls for crossing it.

"This opportunity is for this summer. If she'll be 16 by this summer, Larimer County Department of Natural Resources is currently taking applications for people to inspect boats for aquatic nuisance species before the boats enter county-managed lakes. 

The department provides the training upon hire. To stand out, her resume and application would need to address the points mentioned in the job posting, emphasizing any customer service, nature, and boat related experience and knowledge, including through unpaid experiences. It would be best to look up online how to prepare resumes and give interviews as someone who is new to the workforce.

PUBLISHED: January 4, 2022

A delay in the delivery of equipment has forced the Larimer County Department of Natural Resources to temporarily postpone the collection of a new daily use fee at the Devil’s Backbone Open Space’s south trailhead west of Loveland.

The fee, approved by the Larimer Board of County Commissioners in September, was intended to go into effect on Jan. 1. Other routine fee increases intended to keep pace with inflation and rising maintenance costs went into effect on Jan. 1.

“Tentative receipt of the equipment and subsequent installation is expected in the coming weeks,” Department of Natural Resources spokesperson Korrie Johnston said in an email. “Visitors to the south trailhead of Devil’s Backbone Open Space will not be ticketed or penalized with a fine prior to the pay station’s installation.”",t2_iepz6om,mr_yancey,0,1642594242.0,0,t1_htb48f6,htb48f6,True,SPK83,t3_s7i9j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/loveland/comments/s7i9j2/pay_kiosk_at_devils_backbone/,Pay kiosk at Devil’s Backbone?,/r/loveland/comments/s7i9j2/pay_kiosk_at_devils_backbone/htb48f6/,3,r/loveland,0,3

"Looking at the schedule it's not so bad. You could get on the bus in Loveland at 6:45 and get to Denver at 7:35. That's plenty of time to make the 7:45 train which gets you to the airport at 8:22. But the train runs every 15 minutes so even if your bus is a bit late, or you dawdle a bit, and you catch the 8:00 you get there at 8:37. So it's about 2 hours to get the the airport instead of 1 hour with a private service, with a total cost of $19.50.

> The redesign of the Redwood Road/6200 South intersection in Taylorsville, Utah cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 19 tons (17 tonnes) per year. Compared to the previous design, the redesign of the Bangerter Highway/3500 South intersection saves 3+1⁄2 minutes of travel time per vehicle and 800,000 U.S. gallons (3,000,000 liters) of fuel per year, and has 60% fewer accidents nearby; it also cost $20 million to $40 million less in construction costs than a grade-separated alternative.

"No problem with traffic circles
Huge problem when they make no sense. Frankly it feels like someone just way over designed the whole system expecting a city to be much larger than it is.  And that’s crystal ball design which, frankly, never works

Let’s take an easy scenario that makes no sense.  I get off a major US Interstate.  I’m dumped into a tiny, local town circle.  Not a garden parkway of New Jersey traffic circle that is designed to handle thousands upon thousands of cars, no, a tiny little barely two lanes for the whole circle, local town traffic circle.  I do that circle and immediately drive out into, gasp, what’s that, another tiny local town traffic circle. I go to the office.  Now.  I want to go home.  On the interstate.  

Wait. I can’t just go around the one circle into another circle and onto the interstate.  Nope.  I have to, instead, drive through 12 more tiny, local tiny silly traffic circles to eventually get on one lane, and only one lane, that takes me to the interstate 

Normally when circles are put in they are designed to keep a higher volume of traffic constantly moving.  You can’t claim a higher volume of traffic with one tiny lane that feeds into an interstate.  It also makes no sense to have 12 tiny traffic circles that you route traffic through just to get back on the interstate. 

It’s a very poor design. It won’t expand well. It’s definitely way over designed for the level of usage right now

I’m not trying to insult the town of Loveland, I am looking at it from a pure logical, design standpoint.
