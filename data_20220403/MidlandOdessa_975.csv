"This is the problem with our voting practices. The massive majority of Americans believe that there are only two parties to vote for.

"I'm an insurance broker and this is very common.  Every year your mortgage company gets your updated property taxes and insurance renewal and then adjusts your payment to cover these new expenses (if you have an escrow and they're paying these bills for you).

So while this sucks, it's common and just part of the price of owning a home.  Feel free to DM me if you'd like for me to look at your insurance policy, if you get a cheaper policy (from me or on your own) the mortgage company will readjust your payment to reflect that.

"Yes.

Your mortgage company will sell your mortgage to another mortgage company. 

This is common, especially early in the early life of your loan. They basically flip mortgages in order to profit on the high percentage of interest you are paying the first several years.   Most of your payments go towards interest, not your house.

"Unfortunately, rising inflation has prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in an attempt to rein in spiraling prices for nearly all consumer goods. 

Many home loans are adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs), which means your payment goes up (and down) with changes to the prime rate as dictated by the Fed.",t2_9ri9gkue,rmdingler37,0,1647955422.0,0,t1_i1np729,i1np729,True,Alwayslost2021,t3_tk1ka0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Midessa/comments/tk1ka0/got_letter_out_mortgage_is_being_raised/,Got letter out Mortgage is being raised,/r/Midessa/comments/tk1ka0/got_letter_out_mortgage_is_being_raised/i1np729/,6,r/Midessa,0,6
"Four likely potential causes:

-Adjustable rate mortgage and the interest rate went up.  Are you locked into an interest rate or is it adjustable over the course of the loan?  If the latter, maybe look into refinancing to lock in a rate.  Interest rates are likely going up significantly over the course of the next year or two if inflation continues at this pace.  
-Appraised value of your home went up.  The county appraisal district will re-asses the value of a home roughly annually.  You should get a letter every year from the appraisal district stating what they assess the value of your home to be.  There's an appeals process you can go through to fight any evaluation increases.  You'll need evidence based on home sales in your area of roughly comparable homes if you hope to be successful.
-Property tax rate increase.  If the county, city, or some other taxing agency raised their tax rates, you'll have to pay more into your escrow every year to cover the higher taxes on your property
-Other ""escrow"" costs went up.  Could be your insurance, could be PMI, or any of the other miscellaneous costs that your escrow account covers.",t2_k636y,Predmid,0,1647955107.0,0,t1_i1nojo6,i1nojo6,True,Alwayslost2021,t3_tk1ka0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Midessa/comments/tk1ka0/got_letter_out_mortgage_is_being_raised/,Got letter out Mortgage is being raised,/r/Midessa/comments/tk1ka0/got_letter_out_mortgage_is_being_raised/i1nojo6/,2,r/Midessa,0,2

"It'll definitely be warmer and the climate is significantly better than Austin, as Midland is not humid. So some days the dry heat is totally oppressive but the nights cool off, and the seasons are more defined.  So I think you'll get the weather you're looking for.  No water though.  There are some lakes within a few hours, like 2 hours to Alan Henry and 4-5 hours to LBJ and the hill country lakes.

For your kids, there's sports in Midland for sure but it's nothing like what you'd get in the big city.  There's an athletics culture in Midland, but the specific sports are skewed: obviously there's opportunities for American Football, baseball, and surprisingly swimming.  The rest?  It's hit and miss.  Club sports.  Public high schools have athletic teams.

Housing will be more expensive.  Looking at zillow, home prices are drastically lower where you are.  

Attitude is everything: You can have a good quality of life in Midland.  It's 5 hours driving to any city with 500k people.  So there are going to be some things you won't have, and that's hard for some people.  Limits in diversity, culture and opportunity.  I grew up there and it was a good childhood.  I was fortunate, and don't look back on it and think MIDLAND was a particular problem in my childhood.

"We would come from Alberta, Canada. We lived in Austin Texas for a year while my husband played hockey there and we loved it but this was back in 2003. My husband would be working as an electrician in the oilfield. We are considering the move because I was born and raised in Grande Prairie, Alberta and the cost of living is becoming unliveable. He makes $100000+/year and between housing, food, transportation utilities, property taxes and sports we can’t afford to do anything but work and stay home. Haven’t vacationed in years and don’t have any toys or a fancy house, it’s crazy. Plus we just need a change. It’s cold here and winter is 8 months so warmer weather is part of the desire. Room for promotions for my husband and eventually moving closer to the coast. Living near water would be in my top 3 and a realize there isn’t any there but this would hopefully be a 3-5 year place to live. Better scholarship opportunities for the kids with sports possibly. Showing the kids more of the world than just northern Alberta. We are used to right wing conservatives.

"So here's the thing, the area and people are extremely tribal.  Most people assume that if you live there you have the same world view as they do.  It's not uncommon for people to strike up conversations with complete strangers about the latest conspiracy theory or how socialism and gun control will ruin our country. You'll also be asked a lot which church you are attending. If you lean right politically and are a Christian or are willing to fake it, it's no big deal. If you aren't / can't and don't want to lie to people, you'll be considered an ""other"" and won't ever be accepted. This is true in both social and professional settings in my experience.

"Pretty terrible. 

Midland has a better reputation, but they are essentially the same. Midland has slightly more going for it and some semblance of parks and public places to go, but has much worse infrastructure than Odessa. The public school system in both cities is atrocious, and the private schools are expensive and uh, have had some very recent public problems that have been going on forever. Cost of living is atrocious, especially considering how shitty it is and how little you get for it. Nothing is affordable. 

$200,000-$250,000 is doing well enough, and at that point it really doesn’t matter which city you live in. Just an absolutely terrible place for kids to grow up (as someone who grew up affluent there). If you’re poor you don’t matter, if you’re affluent there is either being super religious or early into substances (and you can do both!). There are competitive sports, but that level is not cheap - lots of good travel teams, but that means lots of trips hundreds of miles away. Rec sports are whatever, and high school sports don’t mean near as much as being on travel/club teams. 

I can’t stress enough how cliquish and classist the area is. Affluence and in is all there is (and don’t confuse affluence with just money - any dumb shit can make money there if the conditions are right). The same people from the same families will happily propagate and live in a bubble where Odessa-Midland is an incredible place to be and see no alternative. 

After being away for long stretches, just the smell of the cities is so off putting. People will just say it smells like money even if they’re not the ones getting rich.",t2_3sx4vbu0,ready_to_spill,0,1646549841.0,0,t1_hzjt7hr,hzjt7hr,True,DC55EE3C,t3_t7rn8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Midessa/comments/t7rn8l/quality_of_life_in_midessa/,Quality of life in Midessa,/r/Midessa/comments/t7rn8l/quality_of_life_in_midessa/hzjt7hr/,36,r/Midessa,0,36
"I spent a large part of growing up in Midland and if you have a choice I would recommend skipping out on it. 

Both cities are basically the same however Odessa has a reputation of being less family friendly but both have their issues. 

As for cost of living, it’s absolutely awful. I would recommend looking at the current housing market and seeing for yourself but there are people easily spending $1,500 a month for small apartments. 

I can’t speak about sports but football is pretty good and most schools will value sports in general.

"Ah yes, the party of personal freedom (as long as it’s within the context of their interpretation of religion).

“The real biblical approach to government is—the ideal is—a kingdom with a perfect king,” Dunn told a Christian radio audience in 2016. (Dunn begins speaking 58 minutes into the video.) “But pending that, yes, the ideal is a self-governing society.” Dunn’s notion of self-government, though, is different from that of most Americans. He has stated repeatedly that our democracy must be brought into line with biblical laws. When secular governments stray from the Ten Commandments and try to make their own rules, he says, “you have a false perfect government with a false messiah.”

"I've had Suddenlink probably three times since I've lived on my own. I don't remember all of them being awful but the latest one was certainly the worst.

In January 2021, I switched to Suddenlink from Grande to save a buck. They installed the service and it worked... for a few minutes. I work in IT so I know it wasn't anything to do with my equipment. I was on the phone with their support at least half a dozen times. I had technicians come out at least three times. Nothing that any of them did helped. 

It got to the point where I had to create a script to record a ping with a timestamp in order to document when the service was up. Over the course of a day, I had service for maybe an hour or two collectively. 

My wife and I were full time students also working full time so having an unstable connection forced us to sit at restaurants and coffee shops to do our homework. After about three of weeks of putting up with the endless calls and service visits, I finally told them to cancel my service. I was ready for a fight but the guy said that because I cancelled within the 30 day window I would get a full refund. 

That was the only redeeming quality in my entire encounter with Suddenlink.

"Moved in to The Trinity and despite AT&T and Grande having service across the street, we could only get SuddenStink. Halfway through our spotty contract (service interruptions were constant), we were informed that they were ""upgrading the service to the building"" and needed access to the attic to run the new lines. I was informed that since I was the person with the attic access on my porch, I had to make special arrangements t o allow these \[curses redacted\] ""contractors"" *access to my home* during business hours on working days to let them up to the attic. Well, the bastards made and broke FOUR APPOINTMENTS. FOUR. I contemplated changing the locks just to ensure that they couldn't just be let into my home at random without my permission and presence. Ultimately I think they got in via the other attic access on the other side of the building, and in the process of ""running new cable"" they disconnected service for every single person in my building because the dumbass completely wired it wrong!!

I had to call multiple times and got what sounded like their Caribbean call center and at Day #3 they finally got someone out to fix the service who spent all of *his* time cursing out their own tech for the mistake. Then lo and behold on my next bill they charged me $150 for a service call fee.... THEY CHARGED US TO FIX THEIR MISTAKE. I was beyond livid. After *multiple* return calls to their ""customer cervix"" and getting repeatedly dropped after holding for hours, I eventually reached the foreign call center again (still a Jamaican accent) and they swore they would credit my account. Not only did they not ever credit my account no matter how many times I called, they jacked my rates up without my consent and I flat out refused to pay the increase. I had screaming matches with these retards in the end and that wasn't enough. They would refuse to put me on with a supervisor, they would drop the call, it was always something.

Finally months later into the screaming matches I asked for transcrips of every call I had made; they claimed that they had just switched over to a new computer system and had no records of any of my previous calls, even for the outages, and refused to credit my account.

I used more ugly words after that, refused to pay the bill, told the collectors to go \_\_\_\_ themselves with that bill and finally AT&T got access to the building and it was all peaches and sunshine and puppies from that day forward with AT&T.

The 1800 number they give you to call is useless. They can only send out another tech who won’t be able to tell you anything. If you want a chance at getting in touch with someone local you have to tell them to cancel your service. Found that out the hard way after two weeks; when we called to cancel all of a sudden they were able to get in touch with someone local to get our service started.

"A lot is going to depend on how much electricity you use. Although Reliant had a lower $kw rate than TXU, their minimum base charge + kw charge would have made my bill higher for the same total kw than it was w/ TXU, even in the summer - my furnace & hot water heater are gas & everything else is electric. Also, unlike so many others, TXU didn't rape its customers during the bad freeze last year or any other time during the 40+ years I've been using them.

Reliability is strictly an Oncor issue since they are the only deliverer in this area.

She’s ruined careers of men and women. Hopefully Landgraf saved it all cause she did apparently and can prove she was as guilty as he. But I know of a minimum of two other men she was sleeping with one was with her at the rolling 7 she speaks of. I witnessed them together. They fought. So she sleeps with Brooksie.

"Unless you live in some of the parts of Midland Core or more high-end Odessa neighborhoods you WILL get homesick for scenery faster than you ever thought possible. The Permian is not a pretty desert like say Arizona, Western NM or Utah, it's a giant stinking shitehole full of choking dust , trash, more trash, H2S, scrub mesquite, choya, weeds, and ugly yucca. Some places getting southwest to the Davis Mountains are more scenic and worth the effort, but anything nice that you want to see is at least 3 hours away in some direction or another like Alpine, Fort Davis, San Solomon Springs/Balmorhea, or even Lubbock. The closest thing to home that you will find in this entire region is Cloudcroft, NM: a perfect place for a Canadian to get back to something approaching the beauty you remember. West Texans are ugly people living in an ugly world because they literally don't know any better. It's all they have ever known and they think its heaven on earth when most people just want to scrape it off their boots and walk away. If it wasn't for oil, no one with an IQ above room temperature would even consider staying for more than a couple of years tops. 

Ask yourself if money is really worth being surrounded by Republitards, anti-masker/Anti-vaxxer morons who love guns and hate you, who worship the antichrist Donald Drumpf as if he were the Second Coming, classless, cluess gits with a penchant for doing things the stupidest way possible because yee haw y'all that's jest how we do it 'round heah and who want to make sure that the only way to vote is the MAGAt way or no way at all. If you have even a lick of common sense and rational thought in your head you will always be socially rejected and outcaste, constrained to live on the margins of Texican society, longing for someplace with real doctors who had actual choices in where to live and work instead of hiding here because it was the only place with standards low enough to take them. Good luck even finding a nurse who can read above the grade school level. Disclaimer: I worked in the oilfield for 4 years and the medical field for another four before I had my fill and got out while the getting was good. 

Benefits of living and working in Midland-Odessa: traffic is mild, you can find blue xea maize corn flour in Walmart, the antiques are amazing, you are close to Big Bend and White Sands, just 4 hours away from the Trinity atomic bomb test site! Marfa Lights? Just go for the weirdos. Roswell, NM and Carlsbad Caverns are in easy reach for a weekend of fun, Roswell being more fun when the freaks show up for the alien festival. Meat is relatively cheap, when it's actually available. Pecans are plentiful. Sunflowers are literally endemic and hard to kill--hope you're not allergic to them! If you like windchimes you are going to love every day here. Sunsets are usually pretty awesome if you can find a spot with a view. If you have ever wanted to learn about low grade craft whiskey or high-end tequila, this is the place to be. Texicans don't know much but their craft distillers know how to make everything from flavorful lighter fluid to really good midrange. The tequila variety will knock your socks off.

"Okay so here's the skinny. You'll make money in a hurry if you get the right job, but it will hemorrhage out of you almost as fast because everyone thinks you're independently wealthy and the hidden costs of living are obscene. Make absolutely sure that you have an exit plan firmly in place and $10 - $12K in moving expense money ready to go when it's time to get out: moving trucks of a decent size just vanish the moment the economy here crashes and the U-Haul dealer employees are some of the stupidest and least competent humans who every walked the face of the earth: they will rent you a car trailer with damaged straps and a truck with a blown engine, if you can even get a truck as big as you need. 

Every single car dealership is full of crooks and morons or the dregs of society for mechanics. They will take all of your money and give you shit repairs in return. Most won't even look at a car more than ten years old because they are cowards who refuse to take responsibility for their own actions when they break things. The Honda dealership ""under new management"" is just as crooked as they were before with the old thieving management. Trust no one in the service departments here, learn to fix your own car or find a Mexican mechanic with a lot full of clean cars: it means they know what they're doing but could be backlogged for months. Midas on Wall Street is good for basic services. If you want an oil change that you can't do yourself, better be the first person in line first thing in the morning. You have to get an inspection pass from a place like that or any oil change shop to get your car registered in Texas. They will always try to upsell you on crap you don't need.

The internet and telecommunications are spotty at best, it all depends on where you live; AT&T and Grande and sometimes even SuddenStink may not be available *across the street* from where others have all three as an option! SuddenLink is the worst damn company on earth and if you have any kind of problems with them whatsoever, good freaking luck!! Their customer ""service"" makes Comcast look like paradise by comparison. They will screw you any and every way that they can. The AT&T people are beyond lazy, they are the worst scum the Union couldn't figure out how to fire and will take forever to do anything useful even in an emergency. The cost and poor reliability of electricity outside of Midland or Odessa is pathetic at best, getting a decent apartment in town is the only real option but you will pay for it. Avoid old construction or anywhere with a window AC unit upstairs, it means that it will be an oven from May to November inside. 

IF it's springtime and there is even a possibility of a hailstorm, do not leave anything you own or love outside or out in the open. About every 3 years it's time for baseball-sized hail somewhere and the last Hailpocalypse was almost three years ago and it took out tens of thousands of cars and rooves all over town.

Texans will always perceive you as an outsider if you weren't born in Texas, you will always feel just a little uncomfortable around them. I have seen very few Canadians stay in the Permian Basin for long. If you aren't somehow magically obsessed with high school football you will find it hard to talk to these backwards weirdos who live for living vicariously though children. ""Friday Night Lights"" and ""King Of The Hill"" were documentaries. Sadly so was ""Idiocracy"" when dealing with born residents. Don't even think of talking about hockey, just do not do it.

The food is mostly shit. Texan barbecue isn't real barbecue, it's smoked meat with the worst sauces you have ever tasted; best to buy barbecue someplace good like Johnny's downtown and add your own bottled or home-made sauce. Texans can smoke meat well enough but their sauces are poison. Kraft Dinner is still readily available on most shelves if you get homesick, Concord grape wine rarely is but the Llano wines are acceptable. HEB brand sausages are good eating, especially the cranberry pork ones and Hatch chili ones. Absolutely under no circumstances should you buy wings here, these people wouldn't know a decent Buff'lo sauce if it bit them in the hoohah. Absolutely do NOT buy HEB brand ""wing sauce"" it's ass drippings at best.

You will not find any good Greek food anymore but if you dig hard enough there's still a few decent places for Med. The Chinese Buffet is uh, scary some days. Do not under any circumstances get seafood here, these people have NO idea what that means this side of Houston. Do NOT under any circumstances eat fresh produce from a restaurant, especially salad, it most likely has not been washed and cleaned properly and you will get sick. In fact, avoid eating out as often as possible; there are NO good Italian restaurants, and every place that has enough staff still can't pay them nearly enough money so the restaurant employees tend to be the least capable, least intelligent scum of the West who couldn't cut it in an oilfield job that paid better. Every meal in town is a roll of the dice for food safety, every trip to a drive-thru is a gamble...

Except for Rosa's Café: Rosa's gets a greenlight every time, it's the best TexMex you will find this side of El Paso. 

The Winters are easy to deal with it's the rest of the dumbasses around you who can't handle it and they will piss you off. They panic buy and hoard, they can't drive for shit in a slight mist much less the occasional bi-yearly snowfall, and the power in Odessa is constantly getting knocked out by morons in trucks or idiots with backhoes. Anything resembling a half inch of snow cripples this region for a week. The death rate on West Texas roads even in good weather is obscene. Gardening is damn near impossible, everything here kills plants. Best you can hope for is some short corn, sunflowers, peppers, and maybe tomatoes if you use enough chicken poo. Trying to find an ideal grow spot that isn't either too hot during the day or too exposed to brutal wind extremes is difficult at best. The soil is toxic and you basically have to use distilled water, the tap is scary bad. You absolutely will have to get a Reverse Osmosis system. Well water out in the outside areas ranges between salty, nitrate-loaded, smelly, and inconsistent from house to house as well as outright poisoned anywhere south of I-20. Don't drink the local water.

90% of stores use freaking swamp coolers and somehow that just makes the heat so much worse and not better. Stores without swamp coolers can be 10° F warmer inside and still feel better to you in summer because of the cooling by evaporation factor. You will need to carry water with you AT ALL TIMES. Get used to drinking a solid gallon more than you have been used to. Liquor store operation hours are weird, and they close for most holidays and election days. Buy alcohol in advance for any special occasion. I don't know what the liquor taxes are like in Canada, but compared to the east coast they are obscene. I think it runs somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 - $15 more a bottle than in someplace like Florida. Texas Whiskey is nothing like Canadian whiskey, it's bitter and harsh like gasoline with an acetone chaser. ""TX"" brand is decent. Balcones is for putting in a parts cleaner fountain. Do you like Tequila? OH WOW ARE YOU IN LUCK!! I don't even mean that sarcastically, this is the place to be to learn to love tequila. Don't drink the ""known"" brands, go with the lesser known imports and be amazed.

Your internal gut biome will be under attack for the first three months until the local bacteria displace your native bacteria and take over. Every trip back and forth from Canada to Texas will require LOTS of Pepto Bismol. The bacteria are unavoidable, in the air and food you can't stop it. Also if you go to New Mexico the same thing happens there @ day #3, different bacteria, same results.",t2_fxfuj,The_Spindrifter,0,1644429709.0,0,t1_hw9557q,hw9557q,False,angrygreentea,t3_qq60uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Midessa/comments/qq60uu/potentially_moving_here_from_canada/,Potentially moving here from canada!,/r/Midessa/comments/qq60uu/potentially_moving_here_from_canada/hw9557q/,2,r/Midessa,0,2

"Being a vet you're probably already aware of city ordinances, but just in case you're not... Odessa and almost all the surrounding cities/towns have ordinances about RVs & campers. Odessa's ordinances state: \[It is unlawful for any person to occupy a motor home, camper, trailer, travel trailer or recreational vehicle on public or private property for more than seven (7) days in a 6-month period. No vehicle, including recreational vehicles, travel trailers, boats or boat trailers, in excess of thirty-six (36) feet in length shall be stored or parked in any district zoned for residential uses. No recreational vehicle, travel trailer, boat or boat trailer shall park on a public thoroughfare in any district zoned for residential use. You are allowed to park on a residential lot for no more than 72 hours at any one time for the purpose of loading, cleaning, preparing for a trip, winterizing or preparing the vehicle for off-premise storage.\]

Inside city limits, you will definitely have to use an RV park. Outside city limits, you can park a 40' camper on private property or use an RV park.

"Bio: Born & raised in the Permian Basin. Started work in the oil industry in 1973, worked for a major oil company for 35 years, retiring in 2013.

Fracking was actually invented in 1865 (no, that's not a typo). In going thru old well files, I ran across wells in the Permian Basin being fracked as far back as the 1950's. Mega-fracks (which is probably what you're referring to) were ""invented"" in 1968 and we started using them in the Permian Basin around 2010 following the discovery of the ""Wolfberry"" (tight shale in the Wolfcamp & Spraberry formations). Wikipedia has a fairly good non-technical article on hydraulic fracturing.

Horizontal drilling here started back in the 1990's.

Yes, the last 10 years have been crazy busy with a few minor busts due to the price of oil crashing and the pandemic. The industry has always been volatile (cyclic booms & busts) and always will be. Technology will continue to develop/progress enabling us to recover oil & gas reserves that we couldn't get to before along with the industry being very sensitive to geopolitical issues.

If you google ""historical population of Midland Tx"", it will give the yearly population from 2000-2019 along w/ 1990 and may give you some links where you can find additional data.",t2_j0qms2vm,Mongoose29037,0,1643159977.0,0,t1_hu8f52l,hu8f52l,True,catherine060405,t3_r53nkd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Midessa/comments/r53nkd/info_on_boomsbusts/,Info on Booms/Busts,/r/Midessa/comments/r53nkd/info_on_boomsbusts/hu8f52l/,2,r/Midessa,0,2

"One thing to consider.

I bet your offer is from the company out at the airport.

Its just a terrible place for this kind of business. Shipping costs to get materials tend to be high, you would think we would have cheap energy costs but we don't.

"I personally don't mind the area. It's definitely an arid climate which can take a second to get used to. I moved here from Kansas so the lack of greenery and humidity was weird but nothing you can’t get accustomed to. The summers are hot but the winters are nothing compared to up north.

"The location here is pretty new but they are already expanding.   They have a location at the airport and are adding  another nearby.  It does appear to be a promising enterprise.  I've purchased stock in it because I think they will be a major player in an up and coming industry.

The main campus is built around an old WW2 era bomber hanger but they have completely remodeled it and is rather nice.  They took over the old Xcor Aerospace location.  It is literally right on the edge of one of the primary runways.  The atmosphere has a very relaxed European feel as they are a Non American company and  they tend to follow the European work mantra.   I've been in the building on several occasions and have yet to see a person in a bad mood. They have a small putting green on site and I believe they have a full time chef on staff.

If you like things like trees, cool weather, lakes, etc, you won't find that here.  This area is on the edge of the Chihuahua Desert.   But the area is 2 hours from a couple of lakes and a 4-5 hour drive to San Antonio, Austin, and Dallas/Fort Worth.  I often find myself heading out of town at noon on a Friday for a weekend trip. This would be easy for you to do since you don't have kids.

There are three hospitals in the area.  One in Midland and Two in Odessa all three with multiple campuses, if your spouse would prefer working at a hospital.   RN's are always in short supply so she shouldn't have an issue finding employment.

"Actually it isn’t fracking directly. A bi product of oil production is a whole mess of water which companies will inject back into the ground (usually around 4-5K foot below surface in this area, but new SWD wells are being drilled much deeper). That water in turn creates fluid pressure on faults beneath the surface, ultimately resulting in slippage which causes the earthquakes.

Not sure where the whole “fracking causes earthquakes” thing came from, guessing media hype. While it is an indirect cause, it’s not what is actually doing it.

That’s fine if you feel like you need it then get it. Then you’re safe. I don’t see the point in getting an experimental fast tracked new vaccine that wears off after six months and has side effects that are being brushed off as if they don’t exist. For my age weight and comorbidities I have like a .00001% chance of dying. I caught Covid over a year ago. My girlfriend caught it six months ago and got pretty sick. We slept in the same bed in the same house all week and I was completely fine. My boss was literally in the hospital for over a week after getting the first dose. My friends grandfather died. I know them both personally. Sorry that effects my opinion on the “vaccine” negatively. There are plenty of doctors that will talk about it but you can find plenty there it will brush it aside so just listen to whatever echo chamber you want.  If the vaccine is so good you should be able to get it and not be worried about anybody else.,t2_gyvdstz0,PartyThe_TerrorPig,0,1639675631.0,0,t1_hosyc35,hosyc35,False,SummerMummer,t3_rgdq2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Midessa/comments/rgdq2q/choice_media_led_billboard_at_front_garfield/,Choice Media LED Billboard at Front & Garfield spewing lies,/r/Midessa/comments/rgdq2q/choice_media_led_billboard_at_front_garfield/hosyc35/,0,r/Midessa,0,0

I personally know many many people brave enough to get properly vaccinated and not a single one of them died or had to be hospitalized. Sometimes if someone who is already unknowingly carrying an active infection gets vaccinated they'll feel a little down for a few days as the vaccine does its work. That's normal with any vaccine.
