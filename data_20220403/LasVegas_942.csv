"You'll be ok. Stay on Fremont St and stay in that stretch if you're on foot (between Fremont St and Fergusons). Normal city stuff.. items in front pockets, don't get incoherently drunk, don't stare down at your phone while walking, etc. If you want to go down to the Arts District, catch an Uber because the area between is a bit darker and less populated. 

You will see a ton of homeless individuals and those less fortunate, but they keep to themselves for the most part and I've had way fewer violent or scary experiences than in SoCal. My wife and I live downtown and walk the dogs at all hours of the day though, so we are a bit desensitized.

Oh and on to the fun stuff. Go see Container Park and Fergusons during the day. They are nice little outdoor market type areas. The Arts District has the best restaurant in town (De Thai) and other options from every cuisine as well as limitless delicious coffee options (Makers, Vesta, Bungalow, Dragon Alley). Art Square has lots of cool galleries of various artwork. Writer's Block is a fun little bookshop with great coffee. Tacotarian has good plant based options.

Golden nugget is a good place to stay. Downtown (Fremont Street) is a fun place to walk around. Most people I know only stay downtown when they go to Vegas. You have multiple Casinos in a very small area. It’s cheaper and super easy to get around. The Strip is where the big casinos are. It’s nice too but more expensive and it can take 15 minutes just to walk from one casino to the next. Downtown is definitely not as nice and upscale as the strip and it will be a lot more smoky in the casinos. Last time I was there the crowd was a little rough downtown especially late night on the weekends. Still felt pretty safe as there’s lots of security.,t2_55pytoei,gcuben81,0,1648996393.0,0,t1_i386ll0,i386ll0,True,gracieSourlikeFunky,t3_tva4zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tva4zr/any_tips_for_a_female_travelling_alone_downtown/,any tips for a female travelling alone downtown?,/r/LasVegas/comments/tva4zr/any_tips_for_a_female_travelling_alone_downtown/i386ll0/,6,r/LasVegas,0,6

"[https://www.lavishvegas.com/pool.htm](https://www.lavishvegas.com/pool.htm) and if you want a more chill vibe guests at the Linq used to be able to easily book at Caesar's pools eg Venus for a fee.

Some cabana's have historically been either a minimum F&B fee (say $1000) which includes rental or a rental say of $200 + a F&B minimum. Harrah's day beds used to be a rental fee + F&B min but I haven't been there for a few years.

Venetian is guests only but their cabanas to up to 12 are $2000 rental + $2000 F&B so $4k on a Saturday but I couldn't see a price for Tao Beach Club (has it opened yet? They've been renovating it).

I like the Marquee Day Club at the Cosmopolitan, you can see minimum spends or book tickets on their site (example for Dom Dolla 4/10) [https://booketing.com/microsite/house/event/61/1109/dom-dolla-full-bloom?eventcode=EVE110900020220410](https://booketing.com/microsite/house/event/61/1109/dom-dolla-full-bloom?eventcode=EVE110900020220410)  but you can also book a day bed for up to 10 people if you don't specifically want a Cabana which is a $1200 min spend that day.  Saturday is way more expensive of course but Thurs/Fri and Sun are also good times. Dom Dolla will be a good set, he's warming up for Coachella.",t2_2eeca3dh,All_the_passports,0,1648944808.0,0,t1_i363bjz,i363bjz,True,rackie2493,t3_tuvmni,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tuvmni/advice_on_pool_parties/,Advice on pool parties,/r/LasVegas/comments/tuvmni/advice_on_pool_parties/i363bjz/,8,r/LasVegas,0,8
"I got engaged in Vegas. We were in a very similar situation. She knew it was coming, but didn’t know how/when. So I knew I had to go big. She still tells her friends all about it and I still can’t believe I pulled it off. “They” say don’t ever make an engagement complex, because so much can go wrong, but I like a challenge 

She’s a pool person so she was at the pool all day. I went and bought blank cards/envelopes. Working backwards I left a “clue” at a few hotels (front desk), there were about 4 stops total, kind of like a scavenger hunt. 

We went to dinner that night. When we were about done, I excused myself, walked to the hostess stand and asked the woman to deliver the first envelope to my wife as I walked out. Inside had the clue and cab fare for all the trips. She went to about 3-4 hotels, collecting clues, and then eventually ended up at the top of the Eiffel Tower where I was.

A town of about 1000 with 2 tattoo artists in town, one of the working out of his garage. I love that story!

"Park MGM - 100%  


The LINQ is great for a cheap vegas getaway party with a group of friends.  For what you want the Park MGM is the place to be.  


The Park MGM is non-smoking✔️  
It's across from the T-Mobile Area for the Game ✔️  
Still has a really fun vibe, but more relaxed and less partyish ✔️  


If you do stay at the Park and you have a bit of time before your trip (1-2 weeks). Then download the MyVegas Apps and check out the Park MGM 1 or 2-night reward.

If you need to get away from a guy at the end of the night just hide in the bathroom for 10 minutes, you’ll lose him and he’ll probably be too drunk to remember you left anyway lol. Use a promoter to get free entry.

Edit: they will not let pepper spray or a knife or taser in as people suggested bringing. They check everything. I do this at least once a month for the past 4 years and never felt in danger. Just be super cautious and aware. Club security is great. You’ll be much safer at a club than at a bar, just ask for help if needed.",t2_43k9653g,EverSinceSara,0,1648889728.0,0,t1_i3378c2,i3378c2,True,mendezevaa,t3_tu67x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tu67x7/girl_stoping_by_lv_on_a_road_trip_what_do_you/,"girl- stoping by LV on a road trip, what do you think about going out to a club for one of the nights? unfortunately it would be alone.",/r/LasVegas/comments/tu67x7/girl_stoping_by_lv_on_a_road_trip_what_do_you/i3378c2/,2,r/LasVegas,0,2

"When there are established civilizations that can and are invaded, you've about reached that point. Human ancestors went into totally uninhabited lands and developed genetic and cultural distinctions shaped by the lands they settled. They became indigenous to that land via that process and because their African ancestors settled that land. They were there first, and their lands were then invaded and stolen. 

In simpler terms, a land's indigenous population is whoever settled it first (and the descendants thereof), especially in cases where that settlement was literally so long ago that genetically distinct homo sapiens ethnicities came out of it. 

Native Americans literally have lived on US soil for so many centuries there is literally no place EXCEPT Africa 2 million years ago for someone to tell them to ""go back to."" The same can't be said for people who colonized the US from Spain, France, or England in the 1600s and 1700s. Their descents could very literally go back to the area their ancestors have inhabited for thousands of years that isn't Africa.

Though, of course, if you think people can't actually go back to where they came from because we all have African ancestors so we'd all have to go to Africa, then I'm sure you're for open borders because it apparently doesn't matter that some groups are settled somewhere first.",t2_am7ivgs1,Whipped_Alcremie,0,1648872317.0,0,t1_i32krqa,i32krqa,False,Yooshixpp13,t3_tt6ayi,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/tt6ayi/parents_home_was_vandalized_on_the_east_side_of_lv/,Parents home was vandalized on the east side of LV,/r/LasVegas/comments/tt6ayi/parents_home_was_vandalized_on_the_east_side_of_lv/i32krqa/,1,r/LasVegas,0,1

"Zouk supposedly has a reputation for these “free entries,” but then will try to hustle you at the door for money. If they don’t hustle you, they’ll most likely put you out on the patio where you can’t even really see into the main club. If you do go, go early. I like Zouk, but it’s much easier when you’re with a larger group. 

If you’re looking for dance music try Discopussy downtown, entry is never terrible and it’s a fun atmosphere.

"Luxor is not a good hotel anymore.

There are many YT videos showing a range of hotels, on a wide spectrum of prices. And up-close, honest reviews.

Luxor is considered just a bit better than no-gos like Circus Circus, and Excalibur.  These hotels used to be decent for a low price, but are poorly managed, and look dated, as well as worn.  

The difference in price is often much less than you would think.  A dumpy motel near the strip, no casino, no restaurant can run the same price as Luxor, or about $115. a night.  In that case Luxor would be a better choice.

Do you homework, stay where you can afford, and how much time you spend in the room depends on the type of trip, and who you are taking.

Looks like a GMC Jimmy or Chevy Blazer.  So on that interchange it’s 45 MPH.  OP probably got over because that lane on the right there is traffic that comes in from 15 NB.  If you’re staying on 215 E everyone knows to stay in the left lane unless you’re going to the airport connector.  If you stay in that right lane you run into traffic coming from the on ramp from George Crockett Road.

Traffic Citations and Penalties  
Assembly Bill 116 decriminalizes most misdemeanor traffic offenses effective January 1, 2023. It applies to minor traffic offenses such as speeding, cell phone use and seat belt violations. Serious offenses such as DUI remain criminal offenses.  
AB 116 will make only minor changes in law enforcement procedures during a traffic stop. Officers may continue to detain, search and arrest drivers as appropriate under existing laws. However, courts will then treat the citation as a civil infraction rather than a criminal offense.  
Under current law, a cited driver is subject to a fine and possible jail time if convicted. A driver who fails to appear in court or pay a fine is automatically subject to a bench warrant, possible arrest and a driver's license suspension.  
Under the new laws, the driver is subject only to a civil penalty of $500 maximum plus administrative assessments and fees if the court finds the driver committed the infraction. Drivers have up to 90 days to respond to the citation. Delinquent payments may be collected by the local city or county for up to 10 years. Courts may order a driver's license suspension for delinquent payments.  
All outstanding bench warrants for decriminalized offenses will be canceled effective 1/1/23.""",t2_107oub,wtfvegas1,0,1648845521.0,0,t1_i312scq,i312scq,False,ThisNamesNotUsed,t3_ttt4s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/ttt4s7/is_there_no_traffic_violation_reporting_hotline/,Is there no traffic violation reporting hotline?,/r/LasVegas/comments/ttt4s7/is_there_no_traffic_violation_reporting_hotline/i312scq/,2,r/LasVegas,0,2

Comped in the true sense is complimentary. I’ve been comped a limo, cigars, a room etc. (when I used to gamble years ago), and it was always on the house.

I understand that comp in that app means something else. I’ve not heard of a resort fee. That’s something that didn’t exist the last time I went 17-20 years ago.

"I certainly would never think of Luxor as being a more expensive hotel. They are usually very cheap. To me, the only things really going for The Luxor is the normally low price and their pool is very nice. If $650 is as cheap as it gets, then maybe Luxor would be good. If for the same price you can stay closer to the center Strip, you would probably prefer that. 

The Luxor offers good access to Mandalay Bay and Excalibur. Beyond that, it is a bitch getting any where else. 

Personally, I would not rule out staying Downtown if you find a really good deal. Everything else Downtown is much cheaper than on The Strip (drinks, food, gambling) and there is more of a party vibe without going into a club. The Strip has a lot of clubs, better restaurants, a lot more to see, but everything there is much more expensive. If you don't mind riding the bus ($8 for a 24 hour pass and an hour each way) or taking a 20 minute Uber ride ($15),  then Downtown may be a good option.",t2_68b3cqwr,Bear_Salary6976,0,1648837749.0,0,t1_i30k2zv,i30k2zv,True,Hunstraucity,t3_ttfzct,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/ttfzct/cheap_or_expensive_hotel/,Cheap or Expensive hotel?,/r/LasVegas/comments/ttfzct/cheap_or_expensive_hotel/i30k2zv/,1,r/LasVegas,0,1

"I don't think you're supposed to tie up 911 with traffic stuff in most states and especially since it's a day later now. Thanks though, I called 311, it's a shorter version of the number the website told me to go to. I did successfully leave a report this time. I couldn't tell what their options where and it was frustrating because it takes a while to hear all the options and the option you need doesn't sound like a police report.

option 6 - Non-emergency police reponse

option 7 - Non-emergency no police response.

7 was the right option. In my head though, I was like, is that for ""beaten wives/kids needing shelter or people just trying to call their spouse's desk who work at the police station?""

Important note: He asked me if I could hold for 911 calls coming in. I know most states like the separate hotline to keep 911 and aggressive driving separate. Also, it's great for police marketing campaigns. The cops can put up on some of the billboards they rend ""Hey! New aggressive driving hotline! Use it!"" and while it's not technically that much different than what they already have it, it shows the cops care about it, it scares people into driving safer, and encourages more reporting and more response to that reporting.""",t2_v2xnv,ThisNamesNotUsed,0,1648830485.0,0,t1_i301n5r,i301n5r,False,ThisNamesNotUsed,t3_ttt4s7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasVegas/comments/ttt4s7/is_there_no_traffic_violation_reporting_hotline/,Is there no traffic violation reporting hotline?,/r/LasVegas/comments/ttt4s7/is_there_no_traffic_violation_reporting_hotline/i301n5r/,-5,r/LasVegas,0,-5

But for those cheap rooms, you don't need to play much. Usually a few hours of $25 bet will get your free rooms.

 My advice is to sit at a FULL table so it extends your play time. Their comp system does not tak into account number of players at the table so the more players the slower the game goes for you. (Formula: bet size x time played)

"If they had a hotline they'd get a flood of reports, many of which would be completely made up, and either way would be too difficult to verify to be worth the trouble. It wouldn't do them much good.

The places that do have a hotline have the same problem, and even if they take reports there isn't much they do with that information at all.

EDIT: Note the main issue is that this is your side of the story. For example, how do we know you didn't swerve into this other driver, or aren't totally exaggerating your side of the story? How would a cop over the phone know either way, if their only evidence was your side of the story over the phone? I guess if this other driver is nuts and doing this a lot they'll be a bunch of reports for the same plates.
