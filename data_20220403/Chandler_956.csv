Is there a lottery system for Arizona College Prep school or is admission based on the interviews?

"Welcome! There are many good schools and school districts in the area. One important thing to keep in mind is that in addition to your neighborhood school, private schools, and charter school networks, Arizona has “open enrollment” that allows families to enroll in other school districts. This can be jarring for families moving from the East Coast.

For example, even if you live in Gilbert your kids can enroll in Chandler Unified, Kyrene, Mesa, etc. (all have good schools). Regarding charter school networks, it depends what you want: BASIS is known for STEM, Great Hearts is known for Classics; both are good.

I think the platform you're talking about is Turo?

I ended up renting with Hertz, but after I got the license.

Temari Fine Japanese is the most recent place I got to go, just a couple years ago. I really enjoyed it and the service and atmosphere were great, although the dining area is small so you might be in for a wait. 

I know Mido Sushi had all you can eat a few years ago, I’m not sure now.  (Edit: their website says no all you can eat right now, but from the phrasing it might come back)

"Looks like someone has given you a pretty good answer already, but one additional spot that literally just opened is Kura Revolving Sushi Bar. This sushi chain is literally from Japan and for the price is pretty good sushi. Plus, you put enough plates down the counter and a little prize will pop out of a device above your table. In addition to the revolving sushi, you can place special/fresh orders that will come out on a conveyor belt to your table. 

As of right now (most) plates are $3.10 per the website and depending on the type of sushi on the plate will have 1-4 pieces. Some special items will be more per plate but are denoted by a different color. Download their app if you plan on going regularly so you can earn rewards and such. 

If you go to their website, the number of pieces they show on the menu 99% correlates to the number of pieces on the plate in the restaurant.

"My current favorite sushi spot in the Phoenix metro, hands down, is Hana Japanese Eatery. It's in uptown Phoenix so it's a bit of a drive, but very delicious as well as cheap.

I'm also a fan of Harumi Sushi & Sake in downtown Phoenix. It's pricier than Hana, but they have some unique takes (they use forbidden rice, which is purple).

For something closer, Teharu Sushi Restaurant in Tempe is a revolving sushi bar. I go every time I'm out that way.

On Gilbert Rd (Chandler/Gilbert), Jogoya Sushi Seafood Buffet has sushi and poke. The buffet is pretty cheap, and admittedly the fish quality reflects that, but I'd call it decent. Across the street, I also liked the sushi at Osaka Japanese Steakhouse. Good size/quantity for the price.

The only AYCE spot on this list is Jogoya. I also know Akita Sushi in Scottsdale has AYCE sushi - I haven't been for a long time, but it was good and well-priced ~5 years ago.

"They will sell you on things like their graduation rate, and the amount in scholarships they’re students earn. They’ll also talk about various lists where they’re Top25, Top 100. Meanwhile, they won’t tell you how many children come into the counsellor’s office just to be turned away. They won’t tell you how many of their absences are related to mental health struggles their students are facing. 

I guess to put it simply, it’s a highly competitive school, and that breeds an environment I don’t find helpful for students, in many respects.

"**[Carrier-grade NAT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT)** 
 
 >Carrier-grade NAT (CGN or CGNAT), also known as large-scale NAT (LSN), is a type of Network address translation (NAT) for use in IPv4 network design. With CGNAT, end sites, in particular residential networks, are configured with private network addresses that are translated to public IPv4 addresses by middlebox network address translator devices embedded in the network operator's network, permitting the sharing of small pools of public addresses among many end sites.

"Double NAT means you are behind 2 NAT routers, ie: the eero and then your XYZ home router.

If the welink inside box translates the signal from the outdoor antennas into Ethernet, it should provide you with an internet IP address. If it is assigned via DHCP from the welink indoor box, it should not matter what is plugged in there, PC, Router, or eero. It will have internet access.

So I think this is the part to look at more, if whatever comes out of that ethernet cable is the wan IP, then you say then not use the eero router and just plug in your own device? Then you've got: wan IP >> your own setup, so there then is no double NAT issue? I have heard from others that you don't have to use their router.

I'm also just curious now that they went from Coaxial to Ethernet, where the conversion occurs (between the coaxial to ethernet?). Because like I said I look into the inside box, there is nothing but a power + a female-to-female jack. So I guess modem is now sitting with the antenna?

So with Cox my router would get the wan IP from Cox, not the modem.

"Okay so this is what I'm confused about. Before this, they have a coaxial cable, so the ""box"" that they install inside the house is a power + convertor (taking coaxial to ethernet). With the new ""box"" the power is there but since it is no longer using Coaxial cable, what's inside the box is just a female-to-female Ethernet jack. So what I'm really curious is this, what happens if you plug a computer directly into the line that comes from that new Ethernet cable? Does it act like a modem and provide you with a single IP from WeLink? If that's the case, having that along with a standard router behind it should not create a double NAT issue?

I guess I'm just confused as to what I can expect by connection directly to that Ethernet cable coming from the antenna.

"Just had my installed done an hour ago, and now that I have a better understand of this. I have the following question. From talking to the tech and looking at what was done, he told me they no longer use Coaxial cable to deliver the data to the inside box. He said that it's just power + ethernet cable to the antenna. Looking inside the ""modem"" (the inside one that plugs into the wall power socket) is basically a transformer + a dumb ethernet connector. To be honest I won't even called a ""modem"".

So my question is this, based on what you wrote previously: 

""Reason why. Their setup is a modem that supplies their mesh system with an IP address. The modem is a DHCP server and there is no interface to disable this setting in the modem. My router is MY DHCP server and that is what I want to use.""

"Awesome, thanks very much. I’ll make sure to get this to my friend should they decide to sign up.

Hitting a bit of a rough start. They were supposed to show up this morning, but never did. Called in to check on status, and was told the rep rescheduled my appointment to next month, I asked why I was never informed of the change they said they have no idea, probably just a process error.

Fortunately the rep was nice on the phone, so I ask many questions even ones about the concern of having two-story neighbors around me. We eventually rescheduled it again for later this afternoon. I'm still on fence about getting the service tbh, as I have t-mobile home internet right now and it's ""relatively"" close to what WeLink has to offer, based on our need (on average 400/20, and ping ~35ms) with $50/month.

"Absolutely. 

Yes they can get a static IP and it is $10 more a month. 

If your friends have a dynamic IP and want to still VPN they can get a DDNS service like [noip.com](https://noip.com) which is free or you can pay $24 a year. The free version you have to sign in every 30 days and update it to keep the DDNS you created. Paid keeps it and updates on its own. They will create a friendly URL that routes to their IP address. If the IP address changes the DDNS service will update to the new URL typically within the hour if not faster. 

A lot of routers support DDNS and have their own interface or DDNS service such as TPLink. The issues is WeLink will use a 1-1 NAT so the router will get an IP from the modem which will be different than the WAN IP address and DDNS will not work using the routers interface. There are a lot of DDNS services out there to choose from. 

So for an example, say your WAN IP is [100.100.100.100](https://100.100.100.100) and your DDNS is [myhouse@ddns.net](mailto:myhouse@ddns.net) you can VPN in just fine. When the IP changes to [100.100.100.101](https://100.100.100.101) the [myhouse@ddns.net](mailto:myhouse@ddns.net) will still work. It's the same thing when you type in [www.google.com](https://www.google.com) it's actually taking you to their IP address, which for me is [142.250.72.132](https://142.250.72.132).",t2_2gtxh9yu,mrpooballoon,0,1636129694.0,0,t1_hjflfb2,hjflfb2,False,mrpooballoon,t3_qne4u8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChandlerAZ/comments/qne4u8/welink_internet_final_update/,WeLink Internet - Final update,/r/ChandlerAZ/comments/qne4u8/welink_internet_final_update/hjflfb2/,3,r/ChandlerAZ,0,3

I’m asking not because I need it. But I have had friends that tried similar serice (T-Mobile fixed wireless home internet) and because of the lack of static IP they are unable to VPN back home so they gave up on the serice.

Finally some interesting aside to share: I signed up with WeLink online a few month ago and they never go back to me. I tried it again after seeing your post, someone showed up at my door a few days later (without even an email or phone call), I wasn't home so my in-laws took their company name and he left. The person never came back. I then called the corporate office to ask if I can get the number for ANY local WeLink sales, I was told they don't have that sort of info, which is very weird to me. Finally, found someone on reddit that gave me the a local sale's number. When I contacted the sales, at first they told me I was not in their current coverage area, so I told them how I had gotten a visit from someone at WeLink.

"I'm not sure what you are saying about the issue with port forwarding and how is it any different from Cox?

I have DHCP with Cox witch provides my modem with a routable IP then my router NAT everything else and I can have access to my servers from that. I use a DDNS service which gets my new IP if it happens to change.

Usually ISPs block ports by default:

  
25  
80	  
135	  
136-139  
143	  
445	  
1433

"Edit 5:   
  
It has been a week now and yesterday my static IP address was completed. But it didn't work. I've been spending a lot of time with them on the phone but for some reason the engineer will not just talk to me and I have to go through support to relay messages. So it's taking a lot longer to figure this out than I expected.   
  
With that being said, My 30 day trial has been extended by 10 days. I have been using it just on my work laptop and so far so good in regards to that. We had a nice storm the other day and service was not interrupted at all during that time.   
  
I'll keep updated to see if they can fix my double NAT issue. I can say right now that if you plan on using their hardware and you are not a power user, I would be okay with making the switch to them. If you are a power user and want to use your own router/hardware I'd hold off until they figure this out.

"LOST DOG- 💰💰💰💰💰💰 REWARD - AHWATUKEE 💰💰💰💰💰💰 Please text photos/videos/tips to 480-670-2855 24/7! PLEASE SHARE!

YURI IS STILL MISSING - it is approaching one month 😭 We know he is still out there, but we are coming up short on sightings. 

As a result, we are now offering a $50 reward for any photo or video that is sent to us that we are able to definitively identify as Yuri! And we encourage you to snap a pic and send it anyway even if you just think it might be a coyote - text to 480-670-2855 at any time.

We believe that Yuri has been hanging out around the Warner-Elliot Loop in Ahwatukee - all of our more recent potential sightings have been concentrated near here, with some at Western Star Park and as far south as Kyrene Centennial Middle School. We also believe that he is traveling through the washes and is rarely needing to venture out to main streets now.

We will send $50, no questions asked, via Venmo/PayPal for each accurate photo/video that is sent WITH a description of the date and time he was spotted, the location and the direction he was headed (if you can tell). Check your Ring / Nest and home security cameras! Reward applies to camera footage provided with date and time at a home address as well!

Again, please TEXT PHOTOS / VIDEOS to 480-670-2855 at any time!!!!

As a reminder DO NOT CHASE HIM OR TRY TO CATCH HIM. We are NOT offering a reward for his capture as he is easily spooked; we just need to know where he is so that we can work on trapping him with the help of HARTT. 

We are attaching some more photos of Yuri to hopefully help identify him better.  Yuri has smaller husky-sized ears! He also has a black-tipped tail and his coloring is lighter/more gray. He is very shy and timid.

We have attached photos of him and of sightings accurately identified as Yuri! Anything like this helps us immensely!

"Very interested in your findings and m super hopeful they deliver the speeds and reliability advertised.
I can't wait to tell Cox to get F***ed!
I too have been a customer since they were @HOME and have witnessed them increase their customer base continuously while raising their prices non stop . Their relentless advertising of unachievable speeds has recruited hundreds of thousands of new subscribers on a network that was already overloaded. The billions of dollars in revenue should have been invested in upgrading the network and everything related to its infrastructure. Instead they have ignored the crippled network and instructed tech support to lie to customers about outages and problems. 
Cox used to be  awesome. Outages were -very rare and tech support was actually helpful.

"Yo! I just moved here and have found a few places I enjoy!

* Veggie Village, inside 99 Ranch Market. I got the General Tso's Chick'n and it rocked.
* SoJo Donuts, technically mesa but it's close enough. 100% vegan donuts and breakfast sandwiches!! (They sell out fast FYI!)
* 24 Carrots is decent and that's in south Tempe, but again pretty close to Chandler.
* Best vegan greasy junk food place is Green New American Vegetarian  (it's all vegan though) but it's in tempe north of ASU. They do a lot of play on standard fast food items. I got the Big Wac, their vegan big mac and it was heavenly!! They have a sister store too that's northwest of the airport in Phoenix and next to that is a place called Nami which is also one of my favorites! They do really great breakfast stuff like, biscuits and gravy and breakfast burritos!

"2 street taco places Warner and Alma School ""Mi Casita's"" is prolly my favorite. Taco's Chiwas about 600 feet due north in the next parking lot over.

For Mi Casitas i get the al pastor, (bbq pork) and then for chiwas I get the carnitas tacos. At chiwas people swear by their gorditas but I wasn't a fan. But their pulled pork, Carnitas is so good I wanna swim in it.

Lenny's right there has different burgers, but their french fries are amazing. Also, they have real shakes and malts. I get the peanut butter malt and it's my happy place.

Coffee, given infinite time in my mornings I would 100% always go to coffee rush. I believe they are a local chain, you can find them in tempe, mesa and gilbert as well.

Venezia Pizza is great, huge single slices and their lunch deals are amazingly cheap. They are all over so just map search it.

Hash kitchen is on my todo list...mostly cause the homie wants to go. I am certain that with that many 5-star reviews its mostly all hype. BUT!!! it cannot be all hype.

Los Taquitos right next door has amazing pozole, which is best describe from this white guy as carnitas soup. It's like chicken soup but better. couple of tortillas and the world is alright.  
Both Hash and Los Taquitos are on price (101) and ray rd.

we have 2 stand out BBQ places, Waldo's and Joes. Waldos has done a better job of expanding beyond one store, but Joe's is Arizona's mecca for BBQ. The most chandler location for Waldo's BBQ is on Queen Creek and Alma School. Joes BBQ is in downtown gilbert, about 15 minutes from downtown chandler to the north east.

Any of the hoosier cafes in the valley are throw-backs to when diner style restaurants were king. The one on Warner near Arizona Ave is amazing. 

And I know its a bit out of the way, BUT as far as local joints go, with delicious food...I have to give my guy Nhat's a shout out. It is a dive. If I ever come into a decent amount of money, I will donate to him to remodel and update his kitchen. Such good food. Anyway its a Vietnamese place, There portions are sizable and the pho is perfect. Its a dive. But on this list, Nhat's pho rivals every other food place I've mentioned. Its in mesa, just north of chandler. The main crossroads are Dobson and Southern. And its right across from the USA's largest community college.",t2_czap0,brothapipp,0,1630729843.0,0,t1_hbj7wp0,hbj7wp0,True,Chemical-Role4506,t3_phf26n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChandlerAZ/comments/phf26n/your_favorite_places_to_eat_in_the_east_valley/,Your favorite places to eat in the East Valley,/r/ChandlerAZ/comments/phf26n/your_favorite_places_to_eat_in_the_east_valley/hbj7wp0/,4,r/ChandlerAZ,0,4

"I have some insight on this as I reached out to council members 4 years ago proposing the same thing. 

Originally, it was planned to bring the light rail down Arizona Ave, you can see it in the general plan and area plans. Once they started fully planning and funding it, major developers were upset that it would effect their business and a large campaign started against it. The biggest player, Mike Pollack, (you may see is commercial complexes everywhere) pushed hard against it and council stopped. Mike Pollack has too much say in Chandler’s politics these days, unfortunately. He is able to rally a lot of people.

Now they are looking at alternatives. Potentially a light rail coming down Price. Or a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) down Arizona Ave. The City of Chandler has also invested a lot in self driving tech., so I have heard rumors the mayor is no longer really interested in the light rail as self driving cars are right around the corner.

Here is more information on the research of using  the BRT. [Link](https://drupal-space.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/s3fs-public/uploads/event-resources/210624_aaaa_final_report.pdf)

"I believe verizon 5g is already activated in all the towers. I don't have a 5g phone to test it. Verizon upgraded the connections in most of the tower with Fiber so it can get better speed. Based on other reddit posts, verizon activated the 5g in many antennas without mmwave. This results in similar speed than 4g xlte in some areas depending in the congestion.

In Chandler, I'm able to connect wtih with a LTE phone at a speed up to 180mbps download and 40mbps upload. I also tested in chandler fashion square and the speed are very good around 100mbps.

Going back to your post, the fiber connection for verizon 5g is very likely for verizon wireless antennas. I wish it will be for Verizon FIOS (Fiber) that is not the same as verizon 5g home internet. One is over wireless connection normally mmwaves and the other is fiber directly to your home.

You’re too young to rent a car, so buy a cheap one used from the above mentioned markets when you’re ready. Have a mechanic check out the car before you buy. AZ Automasters is my recommendation.

Go with Cox, CenturyLink is a joke.

Don’t forget to wear sunscreens and don’t wear black if you’re going to be out in the sun during summer/fall. Drink plenty of water. Buy a car with A/C.

"Oh! Somethin i forgot about for question 4. If you like walking/jogging and whatnot, you'll notice the canal system around that area. Makes for some good paths. The cool part though, you will often see smaller canals that run parallel to the main ones. Some of those are truly ancient. Like, pre-colonial. There was a system of canals set up on this land by the Ho'Hokam peoples waaaay back in the day, they can be pretty cool to explore. It's actually where the city of Phoenix drew it's name (two lines of thought there; One, that society had been long dead there and there was a grandiose idea of ""rebirthing"" a new one on top of it <with all the arrogant implications contained therein, particularly a disregard for several other cultures that had built their own societies in the same territory> and Two, there were myths in this land about the ""Thunderbird"" which overlapped in many ways with the Mediterranean myths of the Phoenix).

Point being: some of those same paths you might walk along have been walked for a *very fuckin* long time. And if you can find spots along those paths where you can see the land, not the development, you can see some really cool shit.

"1) Chandler-Gilbert is literally one of the safest places in the country (I'm pretty sure it's like the 8th lowest crime spot in the US), so you dont really gotta worry about that. The cops can be real jackasses with traffic stops though, so make sure to cross your t's and dot your i's when you finally get on the road.

2)Dunno about driving schools around here. But in the mean time, the bus system is pretty good on that side of town. And some companies will even hook you up with a free metro pass, so make sure to ask your employer about that while you are getting settled in

3)Never fucked around with Cox, but I've had no real complaints with Century Link over the years

4)Nothing really springs to mind. The Valley is pretty chill in general. Make sure to check out the sights. Maybe the Botanical Gardens or the PHX Zoo (Papago Park, where the Zoo is located, is gorgeous in it's own right). Plenty of great hiking around the valley. And just the *drive* up to Flagstaff/Sedona/The Grand Canyon can be breathtaking, to say nothing of the places themselves. Pretty good night-life up around Tempe too, if you don't wanna go all the way into Phoenix proper.
