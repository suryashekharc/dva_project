Less than two weeks after my transition publicly started, a homeless man followed me a block and a half swearing and throwing slurs at me.  That was at noon, on one of the busiest streets of my original hometown.  Had it been late at night, I have no idea what they would have done.

"I find just saying “sorry brother, I don’t have any cash.” (Which I don’t because who carries cash anymore,) is all that’s necessary when someone is pan handling. I suppose I am just accosted to living in cities where panhandling is normal and I don’t find it intimidating.

They are always super grateful and appreciative.

I probably wouldn’t walk *around* base camp, the bushes or trails nearby myself. Isn’t Unity Care on the other side of Banner Bank? Why would you need to walk around Basecamp? Don’t you just drive into the parking lot for your PT appointments? 

Regarding Denver, I imagine people visiting Bellingham have the same experience. They go window shopping in Fairhaven or drive to the restaurant they go to or Baker or whatever touristy things they do.

"Or it could be that I just tend to stick to more “touristy” locations in Denver because of why I’m there and what I’m doing. I also tend to spend time in suburb areas with friends and also out in outdoor spaces. The difference in outdoor spaces between here and there is that here, I know my car is probably going to get broken into at a trail head or park parking lot, there I trust my friends to know which spaces are safe. 

Here it feels like the safer spaces are shrinking. It started with stopping using the rotary lot on old Fairhaven parkway to access Fairhaven Park because of all the car break-ins. The Chuckanut trail heads have been hot spots for a long time so I don’t go there. Now Whatcom Falls parking lots are being hit. 

Where I go to PT is currently across from BaseCamp. Last summer the building was clear around it and you only had to worry about needles if you were on the trails near it. Now there are camps fully down the backside of the building and in the bushes all around. People aggressively roam the parking lot and leave their stuff all over the place which you can’t hear near or they’ll go off on you (Unity Care finally started to get security and the other day it was up to 4 guards in a pack roaming). Someone started a fire next to the building that the fire department has to come and check on. You can’t go there without having to step around poop or puke or someone’s stuff most days anymore. 

I love to go to Sweet Art and AB Crepes on Railroad but now people just sit on the street and ask you for money. I’ve seen knock down drag out fights between people on the corner of Holly and Railroad, especially if someone sat in on their territory or whatever. I’m not always the most balanced walker which puts me in an extremely vulnerable place, not to mention I have no idea if someone who is on drugs that is sitting there might lash out at me for whatever reason, especially since I don’t hand out money. 

Can’t really even go to the mall now because crime is increasing there too with more car break ins. 

I’ve already had my own car broken into sitting in my driveway during COVID. So that has also not helped my sense of security here in town. I’m constantly looking over my shoulder because what’s next? I’m a sexual assault survivor as well. When people who are in a seemingly out of control state approach me, I can’t help but not be scared.

They have no means of providing for themselves so they’ll steal or beg and camp out. 

Emergency room services cost MUCH more than preventative care, so this new building will save a lot of money and do a much better job.

"Better than nothing but also could fall short of what you need. I understand the desire to be less than lethal. I have carried Mace as a non-lethal option. Which might allow you to disengage and flee. 

However, you could end up just making them mad. If you are dealing with someone at close quarters with a deadly weapon you need them to die right now. Not be incapacitated for 5-10 minutes. 

So I don't know if I'd carry a taser. You risk escalating a situation beyond the capacity of your weapon. Police have the option of using a taser or a fire arm if the situation warrants it. I haven't carried a firearm because if you draw it, you automatically escalate to deadly force. A knife is even worse. You escalate to deadly force and if they have a knife you both die, if they have a gun you die. Better to not have that option and walk away.

"This is very sad news. 

The rise of streaming seems to me like an alarming development. It puts a huge swath of our culture in the hands of a few large corporations...  and the people who run those corporations are, generally speaking, barbarians. I'm thinking of when art-house/indie streaming service Filmstruck was acquired by AT&T, which immediately shut it down because it was ""profitable, but not profitable enough."" Never mind that it was the only streaming repository for the greatest films ever made. 

Of course, Criterion now has its own excellent streaming service. But independent video stores created a decentralized cultural repository which was incredibly valuable.

"A couple of years ago, I was downtown walking on Holly, crossing at Cornwall. I was about to walk across the street, walking about 10ft behind a tall dude. Coming towards us from the other sidewalk was a woman holding hands with her little girl who I would guess was about 5.  As the dude walked past them he stroked the little girls hair and his hand slid down her back to her bum. He perfectly timed it so the mom didn't see but I SHRIEKED and he took off running. The woman saw me, saw him and instinctively grabbed her little girl and I motioned her to run across to me and we both went to the sidewalk where I'd started.  I told the woman what I saw and she asked the little girl if that was true and the little girl nodded. The woman was horrified. The guy had run and ducked into an alley, I never saw his face. She only saw his presence but hadn't been paying attention. This was in broad daylight.  The woman was pretty shaken and I told the little girl that if any stranger ever touched her, she should tell her mommy. The woman just nodded and said ""yes, yes"". I stood there for about 20 minutes with them until the woman seemed ok to move on.  After that, I looked up the local list of registered sex offenders. (this is available on the Whatcom Sheriff's website).  I just looked and there are 102, several being non-compliant and don't have an updated address like they are supposed to.   I think parents should be looking at that list as well.

"It's not a gun fetish. Nobody wants to be carrying a sidearm. I have a permit to do so and I've never once carried, and I'll rue the day I have to. I shouldn't have to. It's bullshit that I'd ever need to. Yet that day is coming because misguided folks won't support bringing the hammer down on violent social actors that compromise society's safety. If you're down on your luck or having a rough day, I'm all for sympathy.

I would highly recommend Carmen Andrew. My husband and I bought our first house this past fall and she was fantastic. The market is a bit hard to predict right now but her predictions were pretty much spot on when we were buying which helped us to purchase very quickly in a difficult market. She also wasn’t pushy which I appreciated but as soon as I would email or text her about a house we were interested in she’d have a tour set up for us. She even made sure everything ran smoothly for us when the last couple weeks of our closing ended up being while she was in Hawaii on vacation. I would not hesitate to use her again when we someday need to sell our current house/buy a bigger house. https://www.remax.com/real-estate-agents/carmen-andrew-bellingham-wa/100257242,t2_cmutxnes,RecordingHaunting253,0,1648875374.0,0,t1_i32pji2,i32pji2,True,Gynetrix,t3_tu2wg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bellingham/comments/tu2wg8/realtor_recommendations/,Realtor recommendations,/r/Bellingham/comments/tu2wg8/realtor_recommendations/i32pji2/,0,r/Bellingham,0,0

"Doing some quick math, this is equivalent to using about 10kW per hour. An average baseboard is 2kW. Heating is likely the biggest culprit. My parents have a place in the rim and average about $100 in the winter using weekends only. When they’re not there the place is set to 45 degrees. We also have a wood stove and use it mostly for the heat in winter. It’s 1,000sq ft. We turn off the water and shut off the hot water heater when not there. Just some feedback from another house up there. 
$500 is a lot, but isn’t out of the question if the place is underinsulated and you rely on electric resistance heat which is convective (ie a baseboard or wall cadet heater). 
Improving insulation and more importantly upgrading the heating system to either a radiant/infrared system and/or a ductless heat pump will reduce the energy bill. As someone who works in the heating business I can attest that this is imperially shown and the internet will confirm :-).

"I noticed some mail dumped outside of a friend's place, I attempted to return it but had to take it to the post office.

Then I found more near where I live, I returned it to the door of the owner(s). Then I went on a dump of it set on fire and made sure we salvaged the important pieces and took them to the post office.

Then I got fed up and wrote a Bellingham Municipal Code change and an RCW change. It would require landlords to provide locking mailboxes like they have to provide locking doors. I provided them to a couple City Council members and a State Legislator.

The City Councilor took the idea to City staff and was told it didn't matter because the new apartment buildings were required to have locking mailboxes. I attempted to explain the significant impact to lower socioeconomic classes but it got ignored because City Staff didn't care.

The State Legislator saw all the email exchanges and said they'd chat with me during the interim... Then crickets....and they know me...

While the thieves are troublesome, it's the lazy bureaucrats and politicians that could fix this and refuse to...

"Then we need to build more prisons. Who’s gonna pay for those? How long will it take for these people to actually go to trial? How long will trial take? How much is going to be spent on these processes and how will that affect the broader population and budget allocation? Should we have a bunch of private prisons do it? Because I don’t think these people should be turned into slaves because they’re homeless and that’s what’s going to happen. 

I understand it’s not easy, but your plan is considerably worse. There aren’t any good options, but working towards a better one and a more compassionate one is something that we should be doing. We’ve been trying your idea since Reagan and it’s not working. Criminalizing homelessness just clogs up the justice system and makes it near impossible for the people who get out and try to get on their feet to actually get on their feet. Who’s going to hire someone with a criminal record and who’s going to hire someone without a house? Regardless of what people want to do with their lives, if they’re homeless the options they have available to them are near nonexistent. 

I do want to point out that you didn’t say anything about where they should go if they’re kicked out. It’s just going to be the same song and dance wherever they end up and you know that. Kicking the can down the road so someone else deals with it. That shit has never worked and it won’t ever work. There needs to be an option for these people and one that will legitimately help them get on their feet. Regardless of what you think, you don’t know what these people are going through and you don’t know what they’re willing to do to try and improve their lives.

"My husband and I went through Mike Bredeson and Muljat about three years ago, and I really recommend reaching out to him. We were already pretty ‘data nerd’ about the process and we’d been all over the selection already on Zillow. 

Mike really brought value to that by fitting in with our style immediately. Instead of trying to recommend properties as often, he’d instead be boots on the ground as soon as we expressed even a vague interest in something, or visiting houses he anticipated we would like based on our patterns. We were the data nerds and he was our validation guy. He also has lived here for a long time and knows the ins and out of the neighborhoods and everything, both in town and out in the county.

It was our first house, and he was amazing for this and many other reasons. Will always highly recommend him. https://www.muljatgroup.com/agent/Michael_Bredeson/8314113

Understanding crime rates and comparing them between US cities and regions almost requires a graduate course in statistics and reporting bias. There are lots of attempts to standardize crime reporting across US metro areas. These efforts are are primarily led by the DOJ via the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis), [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov), and sometimes state based agencies like the [WASPC](https://www.waspc.org/cjis-statistics---reports) in WA.

Despite all of this well-funded statistical reporting and infrastructure, *regional differences* in law enforcement, criminal justice, reporting, arrests, convictions are still statistical minefields full of confounding variables and subjectivity that help make comparisons difficult.  In the past, [the FBI has actually discouraged regional comparison](https://ucr.fbi.gov/ucr-statistics-their-proper-use)s . **However,  (IMHO) crime reporting is an important field for all communities and the data sets are important enough that the general public shouldn't be discouraged from understanding and accessing crime data.**

It doesn't take much googling to understand some of the many controversies about crime rates, crime reporting, criminal justice statistics in the US. Recent examples of such articles:

This is truly a minefield for even competent data analysts. Crime is a very personal issue. Those communities affected heavily by crime can feel grievous effects. Specific interest groups have heavy stakes in crime reporting. There are different political expectations in every community.  And the amount reporting of criminal activity and the relationships and expectation of law enforcement and criminal justice vary widely by region and locality.

"Did op ask for the cheapest option? Did I miss something here, because i thought they asked about best? For you, cheapest may be best. For me, Brio is best because it is clean and well staffed, they do pickup and delivery, they have highly energy efficient machines, I don't have to use coins, Garden Spot is across the street and Kulshan is a block away. Also, I rarely use a laundromat, the cost is worth it for all the above, and I can afford it. When I used laundromats exclusively for laundry 20 years ago, best was whichever one was cheapest and had a pinball machine with tight slingshots.
