Duke vs UK is another classic, and there is even a ESPN 30-30 outlining the primary fuel behind it, and there is actual venom there.    

In this thread No one personally attacked, no one threatening violence, and no one with really disgusting shit talking.  You want to see classless go watch Philly sports fans.

"This is entirely my personal opinion but flags around the world are completely uninspired and unoriginal. So you get a lot of flags that basically look the same.

I have a pet idea that we make 21st century flags that are actually images. Beauty shots of the country, iconic person/place/thing/event, etc.

Like the VA state flag. The Roman goddess Virtue (meaning military strength and bravery) is depicted holding a sword and a spear, and the tyrant she defeated is lying on the ground holding a chain and a whip and his fallen crown is by him. Virtue symbolizes Virginia, the tyrant symbolizes Britain, and the crown symbolizes the end of Britain’s sovereignty. Written in the space below the Latin motto of Virginia ‘Sic Semper Tyrannis’ meaning “Thus Always to Tyrants”). That phrase is attributed to Brutus after killing Caesar. It's the only state flag to show nudity.

I understand before modern technology, flags really had to be simple but I'm curious what people would choose for their nation's flag to look like.",t2_75h1893x,100LittleButterflies,0,1648998422.0,0,t1_i38b3uz,i38b3uz,True,xR3DDx,t3_tv94ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/NorthCarolina/comments/tv94ic/im_nc_born_and_tx_raised_i_just_realized_how/,I’m NC born and TX raised.

"Yes it is a misnomer that farms depend on illegal labor to make a profit. They can can support themselves on the current commodity prices (compare current grain prices over the past two years to the past 10 or so) and also government programs for agriculture. 2022 will be an odd year for farmers, while commodity prices are highs, their costs are skyrocketing as well. The two main costs (outside of labor) are fuel and fertilizers. We all know what's going on with fuel prices, and if you don't know about fertilizer cost just Google nitrogen right now. This will be hitting consumers later this year when we go to the grocery store (even more than now).

But like any business that just needs unskilled manual labor, there are lots of undocumented immigrants on the payroll.

"I don't think many people ever get to see something like this very often, so let's appreciate what it is.

UNC won this rivalry. Not the game, not the season, they haven't even won the big game. They won the whole rivalry.

Obviously not overall, the schools move on and there will be many, many, *many* more battles to come and they will be equally epic. But, the book is now closed on this part of one of the greatest rivalries in all of sports and the Tar Heels won it. In terms of accomplishments, Coach K is probably the greatest college basketball coach ever, and if not, he's behind Pat Summit at number two. He won five national titles on his own as a coach. He coached against five separate UNC coaches and at least one but arguably two of them were all-time greats. If you Google ""list of duke mens basketball coaches"", Google will literally just return his name.

None of that matters.

Coach K had a winning record over UNC before this game. He had a chance to get to the National Title game in his last year. His last game at home was against his biggest rival. He lost all of this and one was on a clutch as hell dagger to a team led by a first-year coach who got precisely two points from their bench. He lost the two most important games of his career.

If the median employee were making NC minimum wage, that 337:1 ratio would put him at $4.9MM. Or it would put his $2.3MM at 159:1. I'm guessing, though, that WFB's median employee is making notably more than minimum wage, so the ratio is likely to be lower than that.

"I had similar occur when I got my COVID Booster. I work around education but in an IT capacity. Education is my field as much as health care would be if the IT person worked for a hospital.

Well, making small talk like all the other times lady asked what I did, mentioned education. She asks what I teach, I mentioned I do IT support. She verbally scoffs and says that isn't really education but ""I guess whatever let's you skip a line"". She gives me an injection harsher than even the last tetanus shot I got. I had a welp for multiple days compared to nothing with the first two jabs. When she pulls the needle out she applies a bandaid and SLAPS the injection site before saying ""glad you got yours, too bad for others"". Lady was unhinged. This was a county site as well.

Sad thing is, I have family and friends in medical at all levels from Drs to administration to folks on their way to being administrative head of a hospital. Medical has always done shit like this to folks that upset them. It is never right but it is very sad that someone is brazenly wanting to brag about it.

">15% of those lynched were whites how does that play into your theory of ""no reason other than skin color"", only 26 people weren't accused of capital crimes

&#x200B;

That means that 85% were black.

Poor whites often don't realize how their interest aligns with black people. Somewhere I read that if poor whites would join with minorities that they'd form a force that could change the country for good. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of effort put into keeping poor whites from realizing that and making us fear one another.

What does it matter that only 26 weren't charged with capital crimes? Being charged doesn't mean you are guilty.  So, being charged, regardless of your guilt or innocence, justifies a mob murdering you without a trial?
