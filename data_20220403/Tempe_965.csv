"This…. But I will add, it amazes me how off schedule the light rail can get…. But is still better the often frequent canceled busses that happen regularly.

It was blamed on their need to hire more drivers, and had (past tense) a hiring campaign, but still many canceled trips, that can only be seen on the valley metro app, that uses your gps - in other words you likely wont see (the proof of my point) it until you’re geographically within the bus system.

It used to be more reliable years ago… not sure id its just the pandemic, or if it was better when it wasn’t ran by the city (last I knew, it was operated by the parent of discount cab)…

Right now, in the mesa area, its very frustrating how often a bus gets canceled.

Not to mention how they will re-rout to avoid stopped trains or accidents, that also avoids many stops too.

And for $2 per bus or $4 all day. If just paying on the bus. 

Too often an 8 hour work day has turned into a 12 hour endeavor for a commute of < 10 miles - to me is pretty ….

[Cholla Trail Renovation Update](https://www.phoenix.gov/parkssite/Pages/Cholla-Trail-Renovation-Update.aspx#:~:text=Construction%20began%20in%20November%202021,experience%20for%20hikers%20and%20neighbors.)

​​​​​​​​​​​​Updated 3/4/2022

The Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department is pleased to provide this update on the current status of the Cholla Trail project. 

Construction began in November 2021 on a new trail route for the popular Cholla Trail that services the east side of Camelback Mountain. 

The new, improved route will provide a  better trail experience for hikers and neighbors. 

The alignment is now moved away from Cholla Lane and will include a small restroom as well as drinking water. Special attention was given to providing a Sonoran Desert plant palette that will be used to buffer the surrounding neighbors from the trail. 

Below you will find additional information and background as well as a rendering of the improvements.  



**Construction Process and Updates**

* Construction began the week of November 29th. 

* The restroom renovation has begun and some early trail work is also underway. 

* Landscape planting is anticipated to begin in mid to late April.

* The project is expected to be completed by summer 2022.

* Valley Rain Construction has been selected as the project contractor. Valley Rain is an award winning contractor who has extensive experience constructing trails and trailheads in challenging sites. They recently completed the renovations at Piestewa Peak in the Phoenix Mountains Preserve and have completed many other successful projects for the City of Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department.



**Background Information**

* Since 1997, the City of Phoenix has utilized an easement on Phoenician land which provides hikers with access to the popular Cholla Trail on the east side of Camelback Mountain. From 1997 until March 2020, hikers were permitted to park only on Invergordon Road, then walk up Cholla Lane to access the trail. This condition created several undesirable hiking conditions.

* Due to the volume of hikers, which often reached over 10,000 per month, people frequently walked on the street rather than the trail alongside Cholla Lane. Hikers on the street created obvious safety concerns which led the Phoenix Parks and Recreation Department (Parks) to begin planning a safer trail alignment.




**Trail Realignment**

* Recent efforts by Parks have focused on finding a solution that allows hikers to access Cholla Trail without walking up Cholla Lane. In the past several years, the redevelopment of the Phoenician golf course property has provided the opportunity to consider an alternative trail alignment. Parking access will continue to be limited to on street parking on the west side of Invergordon. Access to the trail will now be directly from the sidewalks on the west side of Invergordon to a pedestrian entry gate. 

* An alternative route has now been designed that reroutes the trail off of Invergordon, south of Cholla Lane, thereby avoiding Cholla Lane.

* The new alignment will also provide a more natural hiking experience, away from City streets.

* Special consideration will also be given to provide visual screening with plant material between the trail and adjacent residences.

* Chilled drinking water and restroom facilities will now be provided at the existing restroom building that had been part of the golf course.

**Trail Improvements Already Completed**

* Since the closure of Cholla Trail in 2020, Park Rangers, Park Stewards and a trail contractor have completed hundreds of hours of trail work to improve the upper reaches of the trail.  They have removed unstable boulders, greatly improved the trail tread and incorporated additional trail posts and wayfinding efforts which has resulted in a much safer trail.",t2_8lxek,nmonsey,0,1648091188.0,0,t1_i1vw51y,i1vw51y,True,mrmikelawson,t3_tlgcf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/tlgcf9/camelback_mountain_hike_on_sundayam_i_crazy/,Camelback Mountain hike on Sunday...am I crazy?,/r/Tempe/comments/tlgcf9/camelback_mountain_hike_on_sundayam_i_crazy/i1vw51y/,3,r/Tempe,0,3

"[Eli the Handyman](https://www.elithehandyman.com/). 

He, and his crew, have been doing jobs for us since we moved to Tempe almost 20 years ago. He's done everything on your list for us except we never had to deal with low water pressure to our kitchen sink. But he did build us a new shower and remodeled a master bath. Exactly how we wanted it done too and at 1/3 the cost of a design/build kind of place. 

That said, his most common jobs are single day or less things, and he's fantastic at that. Most of the times we have seen him have been for things like a couple of ceiling fans, or swapping out old lighting for recessed LEDs, RO install and run to a built in ice-maker. That kind of stuff, just like what you are looking for.

"Long time resident here in Tempe, first time posting here 


I moved to Tempe to study at ASU. Never imagined I would continue to live here after graduating ASU. 12 years now and counting. 

Tempe is the smallest city in greater metropolitan Phoenix area. It also has the highest population density. Like others said, it’s perfectly geographically located in the Phoenix greater area. 4-5 major highways go through the city making it easier to get on the highway. It is surrounded by other cities, therefore, it is landlocked. I think that’s why the city invest into making this city a better place to live. It is close to the airport. 

Why do I like Tempe:
A lot of job opportunities with some of the great companies to work here. 

There’s variety of restaurants with different ethnic food, vegan options, and trendy restaurants. Take your pick and you will like it. Although, I would say Scottsdale have better restaurants which is not too far. 

Entertainment: Mill Ave and surrounding areas make it a good place to hangout with your friends. Covid destroyed few businesses but I hope they bring out even better restaurants and bars. There are so many social events happening here all the time. 

Places to relax: tempe town lake is a great place to walk or run or just to hangout with friends or a date. The A mountain is a quick hike to a sunset. There are alot of parks here. 

Demographics: Tempe is probably the most diverse city in Arizona. You can find people from different background, specially around ASU. 

Just the overall architecture of the new building and forward thinking of the city makes this a good place to live. 

What I don’t like about Tempe:
It’s a poor city. I mean not that poor but most of the people specially in the northern Tempe are not high earners. You can notice that in the grocery stores. Most of the people just look ghetto. Some of the houses look ghetto. Some of the streets look ghetto. 

Cost: It is expensive to live here. Apartments are not cheap here. New luxury apartments are around $1600 for one bedroom and over $2000 for two bedrooms. More apartments are being built but they are mostly expensive. Most of these apartments don’t have good managements. They don’t care as these properties are deteriorating cuz of students throwing parties all the time. 

Traffic: With more apartments going up, more people are moving in. Even in the middle of the night on weekends you will see alot of traffic around asu and northern parts of Tempe. 

Overall it’s a good city if you are single or together or married without kids. As you get older, start to focus more towards southern Tempe as it is more family oriented.",t2_8w2cwqth,Aladdin_Man,0,1647838713.0,0,t1_i1huq6b,i1huq6b,True,Intelligent_Type_106,t3_tim76r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/tim76r/hello_my_boyfriend_i_have_been_planning_to_move/,"hello my boyfriend & i have been planning to move to tempe,arizona. are there any tips and advice that we need to know? anything is appreciated, thank you!!",/r/Tempe/comments/tim76r/hello_my_boyfriend_i_have_been_planning_to_move/i1huq6b/,1,r/Tempe,0,1

"The homeless in north Tempe (north of the 202) are more aggressive, especially around the QT on Scottsdale Rd, cops are there all the time.

As far as advice goes, Craigslist is highly recommended to hopefully rent from a private landlord rather than a property management company. You will have to sift through all the property management company posts, but renting from a private landlord is much cheaper and better to deal with.

Traffic around ASU has gotten worse, so if you work normal office hours, emotionally prepare for this. Location wise, traffic is better in south Tempe.

Tempe in my opinion has changed a lot during this past decade, I’ve lived here my whole life. It used to be way more chill, and still kinda is, but all these new transplants have made it a little more stressing to live here.

It’s interesting to see how the culture is changing here what with all these new people. You can tell who the born and raised Arizonans are as they are usually a little more chill and slower paced and nicer, whereas alot of people moving here come from big cities and bring with them the fast paced and demanding personalities needed to survive where they came from.

"Just know what you're getting into. Arizona is a beautiful state and Tempe in particular is quite nice. However, the cost of living has skyrocketed in the area recently. Two bedrooms are easily going for $1700 in nice areas. Home costs have been rapidly rising; in the Phoenix Metro area I think it's safe to say that most 3 bed/2 bath homes are now about $450k. Arizona has some of the highest inflation of any state. 

With that said, if all of that's acceptable to you, then definitely do it. I might get some flak for it, but I prefer the Chandler and Gilbert vibes a bit more. Some really gorgeous homes in the area and their downtown areas are beautiful. Definitely more of a ""suburb"" vibe compared to Tempe.

"I’m as left as it gets (you can look at my post history) and I know you’re either omitting it or you don’t know what you don’t know. Blanket statements like “doing things correctly from a policy standpoint” is utter garbage regardless of the state - there are good and policy across all 50 states. 

There’s so many spectacular policy failures in California: housing, legalization of cannabis, the high speed rail project, the encroachment of housing closer and closer to forested land combined with the collapse of timber harvesting due to permitting difficulty resulting in yearly devastating forest fires. 

Phoenix has a housing crisis. Boise does. Spokane does. Seattle before that. Austin before that. It’s not a [insert state, city here] problem. It’s an American problem. Phoenix uses less water now to support more people than it did 50 years ago.

"I actually just spent today walking around Downtown Mesa on Main while my mom was in town! We spent about 2 hours. Stopped in the art museum which was free & had a little gift shop. One side of the street has a lot of vacant buildings,  but they had quite a few restaurants, a coffee place, a bakery. Then farther down was a plant store.

"> we have money saved up for a home, but not sure if it's wise to buy in the area right now.

Honestly if you're not IN the real estate game right now, getting into it is not going to be an easy task. Phoenix-area housing is so, so inflated. It may be a bubble, it may not be. But it IS super expensive right now. We sold our place in chandler last year for $450K that we bought for $250K just four years earlier. And according to Zillow, it would go for an estimated $540K right now. 

> Also not sure if renting is worth it?

I mean, you have to stay somewhere. If you're not going to buy, then you pretty much only have one other option unless you have options to stay with someone for the time in your PhD program. 

> Any advice about neighborhoods etc

"Several things: 
Congrats! ASU is great, I did my undergrad there and LOVED it. Arizona is beautiful, the weather is amazing 8 months out of the year and there’s a ton of hiking. ASU is divided up into 5 campuses including Lake Havasu but there’s only two schools on LH so it’s not really considered a “main” campus. The Phoenix metro area is divided up similarly with Phoenix being the largest city and smaller cities grouped near it. Each campus is at a different part of the Phoenix metro area (colloquially known as the valley) with the main campus being located in Tempe. 
What campus will you be primarily studying on? Because that’s going to factor in. an easy guide is 

Tempe campus - Tempe 

Downtown- Phoenix 

West- Glendale/Phoenix/Peoria 

Polytechnic- chandler/Gilbert 

I would recommend looking in For something near one of the campuses (even if it’s not your home campus) because ASU has a free shuttle between campuses. It even has wifi. It’ll cut down on wear and tear on your car while also giving you an extra bit of time to get some work done. I’d recommend looking around the surrounding cities of Phoenix and Tempe as housing prices will be the best.

It takes about 20 minutes to drive from Phoenix to tempe, about 30 from Phoenix to Glendale, 38 Phoenix to chandler and about an hour to go from Glendale to chandler. So there is a lot of driving in your future. Don’t let that discourage you though! ASU has some of the most talented staff and passionate people. Congrats on getting your phd from the nations most innovative university!!!!",t2_3mgk5wge,nahora123,0,1646633303.0,0,t1_hzo94p9,hzo94p9,True,kirk_2019,t3_t8g7nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/t8g7nf/phd_offer_from_asu_where_do_i_live/,PhD offer from ASU - where do I live?!,/r/Tempe/comments/t8g7nf/phd_offer_from_asu_where_do_i_live/hzo94p9/,10,r/Tempe,0,10

CITY OF TEMPE Council Meeting Date: 12/09/2021

[REQUEST FOR COUNCIL ACTION Agenda Item: 6A3](http://documents.tempe.gov/sirepub/cache/1207/rmwypqgq2jofjo4niydvkbxj/2920151703062022102954952.PDF) 

BACKGROUND INFORMATION: AURA APACHE (PL200263) is located on the north side of Apache Boulevard east of
McClintock Drive and is within the Rancho El Dorado Subdivision and the Apache Boulevard Redevelopment Area. 

On May 21, 2021, 

City Council approved a General Plan amendment to Mixed-Use High Density and Zoning Map amendment to MU4 with a Planned Area Development (PAD) overlay with incorporation of the entire site into the TOD.

As a result of this action a condition of approval requires a subdivision plat to combine lots 2 through 5 and lot 38 into one lot. The proposed four buildings would be accessed by a shared drive on Apache Boulevard. 

This request, which includes the following:

The Tempe.gov [page](http://documents.tempe.gov/sirepub/cache/1207/rmwypqgq2jofjo4niydvkbxj/2920151703062022102954952.PDF) has the rest of the details, I just copied a few paragraphs.

"First, congratulations on getting into the PhD Program here at ASU! I'm a year into mine, and I'm glad I ended up here.  


In terms of housing, I would honestly try to find something in Gilbert/Mesa. There are lots of places around ASU proper (in Tempe, at least) but most of them are way too overpriced, poorly managed, and cater to undergraduate students. Your money will go a lot further just over the municipal border. That's my plan for August when our lease comes up, anyways.  


Also, be aware that there's a pretty decent public transit system here, so if you're looking not to drive in everyday, you might be able to find something close to the lightrail train that is here, which will make your commute a lot nicer. Traffic anywhere close to ASU campus is a nightmare.

"I'm sorry, but the reality is there's an apartment shortage in Tempe. Any affordable places are snagged up within days of vacancy.

There's a law out there that says landlords can't turn down renters over a licensed emotional support animal, nor charge you fees for them. If you think, even remotely, your dog may be providing essential emotional support in your life, you could try consulting a licensed doctor (search on Google, there's lots) who may be able to write you an ESA letter you can give to your landlord saying your dog is not subject to whatever pet restrictions they may have. A lot of places do free consultations for this kind of thing so it doesn't hurt to ask.

If you're still finding no luck your best bet is Mesa, somewhere along the light rail. ASU offers a U-Pass for students for $150/yr for unlimited trips on the light rail, so you'll want to look into that. There's less to do than in Tempe and it's certainly not an ideal college life imo but definitely cheaper.

"I never leave my dog alone for any longer than 4 hours (because when training her to be home alone, I found out roughly 4 hours is her limit before she gets bored and anxious). If I know I'm going to be out for longer, I always have her dropped off at a daycare.

I'm not an irresponsible pet owner, I spend roughly half of my day dedicated to my dog, or doing things at home instead of outside (like exercise, which is something she is always entertained watching me do).

Additionally, by a ridiculous price, I mean I won't be willing to pay more than 1700 monthly rent. I tend to be a very low maintenance person, so all of my surplus cash goes to providing for my dog and finding a decent place for the two of us.

"There are lots of places in Tempe that are great. Here are s few of my faves.... I feel good service is a CHOICE. Places can hire servers and bartenders that understand it's the customer that pays their paycheck. Owners of establishments who realize happy customers WILL talk, promote, share, suggest to others places they are treated well at. They will do the same if treated like shit. When s customer goes out of their way to share their experiences it's because the place treated them great or bad.  I have consistent great service at all the below.

"I am sorry I missed the part where you actually said something with any substance. Towing companies do not prey on the weak .. we prey on people that think they can do as they please on someone elses property just because they pay rent. you dont pay rent to own anything you pay rent to live there. good luck finding a complex anywhere that does not have a towing company. Or a solution to your problem is to go buy your own home and trash it up as you please... at least until your neighbors complain and the city code enforcement fines you.

If you dont like the rules dont live there, you should be happy when your kid gets crushed by a car left on jackstands because no one is making them clean it up, or when your car gets backed into by someone with bad tags because they didnt register the vehicle after they bought it. Or maybe when someone dumps a stolen vehicle in your complex and your car happens to be the next one they steal, or God forbid you have an emergency and the fire or police crews cant get to you fast enough because someone is parked in the fire lane, or ask the guy in the wheel chair where he is going to park because someone without a handicap palquard is in the spot he parks in I can go on but your more worried about doing as you please with no respect or thought of anyone else....Happens every day ...

"I'd get it in writing from the leasing office that it's not disallowed, and print it out to put on your dash for whatever lowlife got pissy. 

If it gets towed, the towing companies won't give a shit about the documentation, you'll still have to pay to get it back (and go at their inane times they're open and their stupid ID policies, etc) and force the apartment to pay you back since it shouldn't have been towed by their rules.

I'd make a big fuss at the apartment complex and speak to the highest up I can to get them to communicate with the towing company that what you did isn't a towable offence and they'll be liable for the cost. I'd also get a dashcam with parking mode so you'll have video evidence of who is plastering your car.

You could also crank the wheel when parking and lock both axles by leaving it in gear or in park with the parking brake on to make it more difficult for the tow truck driver (though they may just damage your car and usually require small claims to get money back for damage).",t2_2ob5t,illiteratebeef,0,1645823337.0,0,t1_hyfj1in,hyfj1in,True,InterimApathy,t3_cwtulg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tempe/comments/cwtulg/backing_into_parking_space_against_city_ordinance/,Backing into parking space against city ordinance?,/r/Tempe/comments/cwtulg/backing_into_parking_space_against_city_ordinance/hyfj1in/,1,r/Tempe,0,1

"It is Not a made up thing it is actually an ordinance for Arizonas Crime free housing initiative there are 3 levels the communities go through and in the second level Backing into a parking space is prohibited.

That being said, it is important to note that when you rent an apartment or residence of any sort it is private property iowned privately by a corporation or individual. Written in a lease or not the owners or managers of that property have a right to designate policies concerning towing or anything else as they see fit and for whatever or whenever they like without warning.

"They either accept or decline what they are offered. They don't order anything. If they decline this offer, there may not be another one for a long time.

Fun fact: Section 8 housing is funded by the FEDERAL government and not the municipal government. So, that argument is just another indication that you haven't done your homework.

Another fun fact: If the city placed public housing on Tempe Town Lake land, they would forgo HUGE property taxes that they could pull in from a luxury development there. This is luxury land. It is insane not to use it as such.

Another fun fact: You put public housing on relatively cheap land... and land near public transportation. This development isn't vert close to a light rail station. So... you want public housing that can't easily access public transit? They should just have to own a car, because who cares about those not so financially well off?

"We do? That's news to me. The last time I looked, the Phoenix metro area had a 5% vacancy rate, which is very, very low (like how unemployment bottoms out around 4-5% and not 0%). There is a reason why both buying and renting are increasing so damn fast: 100,000 people are moving to the Valley each year and we are nearly a decade of home construction behind demand.

And if nothing is developed there, the city goes even longer without tax revenue. The alternative to this project is nothing, not something even better.

Look at downtown Phoenix: It was a dead zone since forever, until recently.

I don't get this. It strikes me as an effort lead by naive not-so-experienced young adults who are not tied to the community and won't even live here when this is built whining about something that is good for the community: (1) Yes, YOU may not live there, but this isn't about YOU; (2) The property taxes the city will EVENTUALLY get are very, very important and can be used for all sorts of great things like subsidizing affordable housing and education; (3) By opposing the building of housing, even if it is luxury housing, you're just driving up housing costs; (4) It's really dense! Isn't that exactly what Tempe, a landlocked city, needs? (5) Developers develop land. Not the city (the vast majority of the time). Not activists. If not this, then what?

"if your aim is to increase union participation statewide or even on a smaller scale (i.e county or city wide), then you should start advocating or link up with existing advocates for getting rid of ""right to work"" laws. These laws basically neuter unions and allow non union workers to reap the benefits they didnt contribute to.

I agree we need more union participation in the area and the big box stores are kinda ruining the community feel that has been built. Sure one or two small businesses might stay around and ""compete"" against the bigger ones for a while but they will eventually be run out of business.

capitalism needs to go but that is a much harder uphill battle against decades of propaganda,   and what i would consider and almost cult like mentality that is adverse to changing it.

What does your comment have to do with unionizing for the workers that support these huge companies.

How are you connecting the points? Is your point that they are so big we should give away labor without organized negotiations?

These large corporation can be both what you are boasting about as well as accountable to their employees.

You seem to be overly concerned about tech benefits, and minimally concerned about the wellbeing of other workers. Perhaps a post about empathy is not for you.

Manual laborers are just as important and should not be ignored because a company treats their tech side well.    There is no reason for people to stand up to defend them prohibiting their workers from unionizing.

No one is forcing Starbucks or Wholefoods or Amazon to fire unionizing employees. They do not want people to be able to unite in a way that may benefit something other than their profit and the corporation.

Unions are a way to make sure these corporations are accountable and not exploiting workers. People make more money after they join unions.

">Wholefoods and Starbucks took the place of local grocers and smaller businesses that were already there.

Wholefoods in downtown Tempe moved into what was known as a food desert. There is a store that calls itself a farmers market nearby and a Japanese market down the street. Neither of them are full service grocery stores and neither has gone out of business since whole foods moved in. It is unlikely that whole foods will seriously affect the Japanese market (given it is a specialty store). It is more possible, but also relatively unlikely, that it will seriously affect the farmers market store given that most of the people going to it are pro local and anti amazon and thus unlikely to shift to whole foods.

I'm not as familiar with the Starbucks, but pre-pandemic romancing the bean did a roaring trade and still seems to be in business even though it's, what, a block and a half from the Starbucks?

"From an entrepreneurs standpoint, I think the most effective solution to the problems you are experiencing would be to open your own grocery store or coffee store. Sounds impossible to a lot of people, but if you set your mind to it, it really would be possible. People want good coffee they know they can get quickly in a clean place with wifi and have a quick business meeting. Starbucks is my go to meet up with new people since it has a reliable atmosphere you can have a private conversation with a decent cup of coffee. Unions won't be coming to AZ for a long time, we are a right to work state and Unions don't stand much of a chance here sadly. Being proactive about your problems is the best route, but I don't think holding a sign for unionization is going to make any impact to be honest.
