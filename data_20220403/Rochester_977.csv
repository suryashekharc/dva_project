I think the mindset that our only options are fossil fuel or EV is the problem here. They are not. Once you start comparing the entire lifecycle of EV against an alternative, the issues with EV become more glaring. You have to look at it holistically, which means including the acquisition of raw materials, the impact of those mining operations to the environment and surrounding communities, the processing of those materials and impact to both environment and community as well, and then finally the eventual waste.

Nothing sounded like Covid but it’s worth mentioning this was just when numbers were starting to drop a few weeks back and none of these kids are old enough to be vaccinated, obviously none were in a mask.

This kids were noticeably “sticky,” Why the fuck do you bring them out: a: in public spaces, b: around other children, c: to a bloody bar!? I get that parents need a reprieve, and it’s probably cathartic to commiserate your child rearing woes with other folks your age. But this was wildly rude. At the very least to share a table with strangers and talk nothing but your child’s diarrhea at a restaurant!

I’m a physician, a see gross horrible things day in and out. I don’t need to hear it or see it while I’m eating.

"Honestly I think we really need to normalize having no kids allowed activities. But if it doesn't specifically say no kids allowed you should expect that there will be kids there.

There was a time when people would leave their kids and their dogs at home and it was a social faux pas to not do so. Personally that's something I think we should bring back.

Parents do the best they can most of the time and as other people have pointed out be a multitude of reasons for this situation. However I will point out that part of human social development is learning societal norms one of which is not talking during things like this.

"You know, it doesn't seem like you believe I'm saying any of this in good faith. Just as there are some people who will criticize any child making noise or just behaving like a child, a natural developmental stage that EVERYONE goes through, there are also some people who will trip over themselves to defend any parent, no matter there behavior. I worked at a toy store and of course kids sometimes make a mess or run or do other things like that, and parents can't always stop them. We had a couple of families whose kids would come in, tear around the store, make a mess, not listen to any adult telling them to stop, and their parents would just watch and do nothing. Sometimes it is okay to criticize other people's parenting, not everyone who does so is some r / childfree asshole. I've worked with kids before, I like them, and in my experience most parents are doing their best. Unfortunately some aren't, and it is okay to criticize them.

 > Ultimately, the only way kids can learn how to behave in public is by being exposed to better behavior models to emulate.

But the thing is, if you just continue to talk to your child for the whole show rather than telling them not talk, then how will they learn that? Don't you have to actually expose them to better behavior?

There were two adults. One could have taken the youngest outside and stayed in the lobby with them. There's plenty of room out there, I'm sure it would be fine if they talked or played. That was an option they could have taken. 

Society always has to balance the needs of the group, the needs of the individual, the needs of the family. Some people go too far in saying we should never have to make any accommodations for children. That's unreasonable, because how will they grow up to be adults, how will society continue? But some people like you also jump to the defense of any poor parenting, no matter what. Just as it's necessary for everyone in society to make accommodations for children, parents also have to make some concessions to others. It's a give and take, never 100% the responsibility of any one party.

"There aren't really any good options there. The parent could have not take the youngest, but then someone has to watch them, meaning one parent would have to stay home or some other family member has to watch them. Some families are one parent, though. If there is no family in the area who could take them it can be a big ask to have a friend watch them, particularly that late. Plus, that youngest kid may feel left out if the whole family is going and they're the only one who can't go. Do that often enough and that kid could end up with issues.

It is very possible that the parents were doing the best job they could, given their circumstances. I'm not trying to downplay how annoying it was for you, and its possible the kid really was too immature to be put in that position.

"Like others said, your town/city likely based the re-assessment on home sales since the last time it was done a few years ago and you'll need to check comparables to see if it makes sense. They should send a letter outlining how your taxes will change (or you can call) which likely won't be much (or change at all) when they re-assess their entire municipality.

As an example, the city re-assessed my place based at the price I purchased it for which was nearly twice their previous assessment sweep but still over 25% below comparable home sales in my neighborhood. My taxes went up a little bit but I didn't fight it because there's an upside to your investment having a formalized increased value. When I refinanced during the pandemic interest lows, my bank assessment was 25% above the city's which was then back inline with past city vs private assessments.

As for being in a bubble, just my opinion based on watching the housing markets but I feel pretty confident that the super cheap Rochester homes of 10+ years ago are a thing of the past as we're still well under the still rising national average so we probably won't experience a significant drop from here if other larger more desirable city markets correct. You can live pretty large here with a budget of $200k for similar homes that cost $500k-$1M+ in many other cities now. It's a bitter-sweet situation because I escaped the rental market where my mortgage is half the cost of a 2 bedroom in a decent area now but it would be ridiculously expensive to move anywhere else I like that's nice and warmer.",t2_ihmc2fvw,GunnerSmith585,0,1648996666.0,0,t1_i387774,i387774,True,Dumpster-cats-24,t3_tv8xvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/tv8xvf/appealing_an_assessment/,Appealing an assessment,/r/Rochester/comments/tv8xvf/appealing_an_assessment/i387774/,3,r/Rochester,0,3

ive also used ""traffic"" to see when roads are busier. this is less of an exact science. i wouldnt fully rely on traffic to tell you everything but if you know you are going to be going through an area at a certain time and it likes to go red, it probably means you  will be dealing with alot more cars on the road in that section.",t2_31xayc67,trixel121,0,1648963342.0,0,t1_i36vc8g,i36vc8g,True,BeeBop1983,t3_tut8ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/tut8ku/biking_trails/,Biking trails,/r/Rochester/comments/tut8ku/biking_trails/i36vc8g/,2,r/Rochester,0,2

"Auburn trail from pittsford to Farmington is a quite nice flat dirt trail. Stretches for a little over 10 miles or so and is a peaceful little trail. Has a ~4 car parking lot at the start of it in Pittsford, no idea if it ever fills up though as I always ride there instead of driving there.  

The Genesee river trail connects to the Erie canal trail and goes all the way down to the beach in Charlotte, only a few sections where you have to ride the road. Ride the erie canal trail to the U of R, turn onto the Genesee river trail until it ends at South Ave/St Paul, and then ride that until you can turn left onto Brewer St. You can ride the trail all the way down to the bike path on Lake Ave, and then turn back onto the trail towards the beach. Very nice route, worst section is the time spent on St Paul but it really isn't that bad. Has large sidewalks and a bike path on the way there.   

Not exactly a trail but have you been to the cemetery on Mt hope? The roads in there are very fun to ride except for some of the potholes. Lots of flat sections on one side to go on and then a huge hill section on the other side of the cemetery.

"[we have a ton of local courses](https://grdgc.org/courses/) and they are all unique in their own way. For beginner play you can try lookup park, the holes are very short, however there are ponds and it's often very wet in early spring.

Ellison is a great general course, but it's currently set up for winter play (and has a bunch of hills so it can be tiring for little ones). 

Widener park is one of my favorite because they mow it a lot like a real golf course. Also really love churchville as they have a playground and picnic benches through the course to let the kids run free.

"That’s from Formula 1. It’s supposed to be JB 17 and AH19

JB17 is Jules Bianche (racing number at time of death was 17) who crashed into a JCB tractor at Suzuka (Japanese GP) 2014 while the tractor was removing another crashed car after rain suddenly poured onto the track causing poor visibility and loss of traction. His death caused significant safety improvement to motorsport like the introduction of Virtual Safety Car to immediately neutralize the race, the introduction of the “halo” (in Formula races) and “aeroscreen” (in Indycar), which ended up saving many drivers from head impact since, most notably Romain Grosjean at Bahrain 2020, Charles Leclerc at Belgium 2018, and Mick Schumacher in Saudi 2022.

AH19 is Anthoine Hubert (racing number 19), a very promising F2 driver, who passed away after a heavy crash at Eau Rouge/Radillon complex at Spa Francorchamp (Belgium) 2019. He got involved in a big, but not lethal crash but immediately got bounced back into the racing line by the protection wall and got t-boned by another driver. The multiple impacts due to contact in the 1st crash and the barrier meant his crash structure was already destroyed before the tbone. His death lead to further safety changed at Eau Rouge/Radillon to avoid car being bounced back into the racing line. 

These 2 are the latest to pass away due to an accident at a race weekend. You’d have to go quite a long way back to find another fatal crash in F1 and their feeder series, although IndyCar also has a few casualties in the 2010s (Dan Wheldon at Vegas comes to mind)",t2_z9mp8,StingerGinseng,0,1648905981.0,0,t1_i33t9a0,i33t9a0,False,AltAccountWhoDis,t3_tug2m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/tug2m8/the_bills_on_rplace_simply_a_masterpiece/,the Bills on r/place.

"This. I started with Wegmans in 06 with my passion for food and my new career high. When I started, I'd get at least three or four customer compliments a month and they'd give me an $8 coupon (enough to get a free sub or hot bar for lunch), and say ""lunch is on us today""....


When I left 8 years later after battling corporate and even proving to them my numbers for the department I ran were projected way higher than the bigger stores in the region, I'd have customers come up asking if I got their compliment, I'd say ""no"" and then watch them go to the store manager and yell at him (small community Wegmans). The store manager would then walk over with a pissy look on his face and say ""thanks"" and literally toss a $3 CARE coupon at me. This happened twice. 

Since the daughters took over, they only care about their summer lake parties and new cars, so they are fully planning on making Wegmans a public offering once Danny passes. They want every Wegmans to be a clock tower store in rich untapped neighborhoods, while the small community demographic Wegmans that initially built the company to where it is today get left behind with corporate decisions that don't fit their specific demographic. You know, third generation business educated greed. 

 I was told multiple times that corporate didn't care that I was throwing out (shrinking) so much produce after they took full control around 2014 on my department when I'd suggest our customer demographic doesn't want to buy full pounds of Veggie Market items. 

My manager who I loved was replaced by some HR Corporate lady who literally yelled at me for going behind her back and lowering the amounts in our Veggie Market so we actually sell the product out instead of forcing full pounds on little old ladies and college students and throwing 3/4 of the product away. My new manager thought it'd be fun to play manager and work herself up to another corporate position by doing a short stint as my manager.

"Adding to this, there’s a lot of complexity that can trip you up if you aren’t familiar with printing. It’s not just “hit ‘print’ and walk away” like “paper” printers are.

There’s a lot of things you can adjust to affect the success of your print, such as the orientation of the piece on the print bed, and whether you need/have support materials. Then things like infill and layer heights affect strength and detail.

That’s why it might be best to find and work with someone to ensure your print is actually successful.

"Good point I suppose. I mean my thought was that by the time I had made the post, I had thoroughly checked my tracks, asked the grocery store to look out, and waited a few hours, so if it was a matter of it waiting to be found, I think it already would've been. And my thinking was, if it was waiting to be found, making a post telling exactly where it got lost would probably attract a lot of people looking to find it first and pocket it themselves or social engineer the staff into calling them first if the staff finds it. And I don't think it's an unreasonable worry, it's worth a not insubstantial amount of money and I think the most likely scenario is that someone found it and pocketed it anyway. At this point though I'd like to have it back, but enough people have taken issue with this post in some way that its sapped all energy I have to care about if someone pockets it because I posted the location.

"Honestly struggling with that. It used to be Nashville Hot Chicken in Farmington BUT the last two times I had it (it's the closest to me and it was months apart) it was overcooked. If you get it cooked right it's as close to Hattie B's as you can get in the area. 

Chick Magnet has great chicken but their sandwiches are basic and boring. They lack flavor and Texas Toast is a horrible bread choice. 

Tap & Mallet had one their last month of operation that was delicious. 

Just Chik'n isn't a traditional hot chicken sandwich but if you want a delicious spicy sandwich akin to Wendy's it can't be beat.

I guess I'll check out Chick'n Out today?


*Side note: the best Nashville hot chicken sandwich you can find is in.....

"It depends on if you actually want a puppy or an older dog. My first two dogs we lucked out and found on Craigs List. Last year when my second dog passed, after our grieving when we decided to get a new puppy it was a bit hard finding one this time. Nothing was on Craigs List at the time other than purebred breeders. Even though I've known people to have gotten puppies from shelters like my wife's parents they're typically snatched up quick. I checked every shelter from Buffalo to Albany and there were no puppies. The youngest was two years but they averaged like 4-8 years old with several being even being older than that. Animal rescues have an annoying couple of weeks approval process and end up costing you as much as just buying a dog with their ""rehoming"" fees. I ended up buying my puppy from Your Dream Puppy here in Rochester. She turns a year old today and wasn't that expensive at $600. You can't really put a price on the joy they bring to your family though. :-) I also checked out the Pet World in Country Club Plaza and Allie's Pet Corner but they didn't really have anybody that fit well with my family.

"Don't underestimate the value of stocked pantry. Maintaining (ensuring you always have a set quantity on hand by rotating and steadily consuming) non-perishable food which is equivalent to at least a couple of weeks of meals not only addresses this need, but also helps in an emergency like an extended power outage.

You can either can your own, or buy canned/jarred from the factory. Shelf-stable food (i.e.: not refrigerated or frozen) doesn't require any cooking. Serving warm may be more pleasant, but isn't required from a food safety perspective.

Options include, but are not limited to:

* fruit
* vegetables
* beans
* soup/stews
* meat
* bread (not a typo)
* nuts & nut butters
* crackers
* quick oats

Quick oats with some frozen blueberries or dried fruit makes a really quick and nutritious snack. Crackers and nut butters or canned meat also works well in a pinch. So does a can of soup, which takes 2 minutes to microwave, but doesn't need to be. V8 is just tomato-based vegetable soup.

Sure, it will be even healthier if you DIY. But, if you're short on time, virtually all of these options are healthier AND cheaper than fast food. 

Keep in mind that there's no need to pay the Wegmans tax for shelf-stable foods. Explore some local ethnic markets, Aldi, Price Rite, Walmart, Tops, Trader Joe's, etc.

Add 20 cans of something to your normal grocery list each time you go, and you'll be well on your way to stocking that pantry without feeling much of a pinch to your bottom line.

"Thanks for the thoughts! I have an old garden tractor but have been looking into legit tillers. However I'm not a fan of disturbing the soil so intensively, with no guarantee that it would kill the weed seed bank. I would also need a fair amount of herbicide, luckily some seem to break down quickly and aren't harmful, but lesser of two evils type of thing.

I haven't really considered just letting it go wild. I like the thought of it, but I have specific native plants in mind to create a diverse meadow, rather than let it go and likely have the grass and other ""weed"" flowers still outcompete and eventually become a bit of a monoculture.

I have been thinking of ways to smother the grass, but boy I'm too impatient to think of piecemealing it all together. It'll already take a good few years after seeding for the meadow to establish, so I'm trying to blitzkrieg this thing while still making sure it can be successful",t2_r9hi2mi,StickyFingyReggie,0,1648828063.0,0,t1_i2zvjdi,i2zvjdi,False,thewarehouse,t3_ttqg1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/ttqg1k/happy_friday_rochester_how_are_you/,Happy Friday Rochester!
