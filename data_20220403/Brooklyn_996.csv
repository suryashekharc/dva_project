"From where you're staying, a couple route ideas:

1. Run to and across the Pulaski Bridge to Long Island City. Beautiful run along the western waterfront of LIC, then up to Roosevelt Island Bridge. You can cross the bridge and loop all or some of Roosevelt Island before heading back.

2. (Optionally run through McCarren Park / Domino Park), then over the Williamsburg Bridge. There's a great running path along the entirety of the south + west sides of Manhattan. So, you can swing south to the south point of Manhattan, then up the west side until you cut back across to Williamsburg Bridge. Or, you can go straight west across Manhattan to go a bit further north up the west side highway (Hudson River waterfront).

You can also cross into Manhattan and run along the east river, though there's some construction along certain parts at the moment. You can run the Queensboro Bridge to Central Park, which is fun to experience too.

I second the idea that Prospect Park is an amazing place to run, but IMO your route to get there isn't very fun.",t2_hqbwl,gabergg,0,1649003468.0,0,t1_i38myse,i38myse,True,Classic-Scientist-97,t3_tv83m6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/tv83m6/running_in_brooklyn/,Running in Brooklyn,/r/Brooklyn/comments/tv83m6/running_in_brooklyn/i38myse/,2,r/Brooklyn,0,2

"You'll be in a pretty safe neighborhood in a cool part of town with lots of quiet streets and some scenic industrial areas to run. Of course always keep your eye out for cars/bikes and be considerate to walkers, just like in London.

My personal favorite long run in your neighborhood is to make my way west to Franklin, run south til it turns into Kent Avenue, then run the bridges, taking the Williamsburg Bridge to Chinatown, Manhattan Bridge back to DUMBO, and the Brooklyn Bridge to the financial district, Manhattan Bridge back to Flushing Ave, and head north along the shore til you get home.

Between Owl’s Head Park and the Verazzano Bridge you can run directly on the water path - or do the hills on Shore Road and see some of the beautiful homes and foliage along that stretch. There are a few overpasses along the way to get you over the Belt Parkway that runs along there. 

Anyway if you keep going toward what used to be the Bazaar, along the water, the next overpass after the one under the verazzano brings you to Dyker Beach Park which is a nature preserve, golf course, sports complex in Dyker Heights. That’s 2.2 miles in circumference.

"These posts are befuddling to me. People of all ages live in all neighborhoods. 

In either neighborhood, you’ll find bars that cater to younger folks with a younger feel and vibe. You’ll find bars that are more relaxed for people who enjoy craft beverages. At both neighborhoods, you’ll find restaurants and coffee shops at all difference price points and experiences. 

I know your question isn’t “will I find young adults at bars catering to young adults and will that therefore make me think this neighborhood is young.” But, heavily implied in your post is a crazy simplified erasure of the many generations of families that have lived in and shaped both neighborhoods. I don’t know who on this thread is saying there aren’t families in one neighborhood more so than the other — other than folks who for various reasons don’t see the public school buildings and family owned businesses everywhere.

There are strollers in both. Older people in both. Adults in both. Diversity in both. Both neighborhoods have tens of thousands of residents, and both neighborhoods have nearly identical percentages of households with children (around 25%). 

I’ve lived in both neighborhoods, and yes, you will see packs of young adults walking around on Friday nights. In Crown Heights you’ll see it on streets with bars. In Clinton Hill you’ll see it on streets with bars. It’s really nothing to write home about. 

I’m amazed by all the posts in here that say one neighborhood vs. the other. It’s really just people airing their biases.

"Do you even meet the criteria to transfer schools?
Not liking your school is not a valid reason to transfer. You really only get one shot in freshman year to transfer out for sophomore year based on the same lottery admission. But that’s only subject to seat availability in these other schools. Or you test out and get into a specialized high school. The other criteria are legitimate circumstances that prohibit you from attending your current school. Personal hatred for the school is not one of them.

If you expect more freedom, Madison is not the school for you. The school has fixed metal detectors that you are required to go through every single day.

Most NYC high schools don’t allow you to make your own schedule. The regents high school diploma curriculum fills up all the available slots. You really only get a choice in electives like gym, art, and an elective. But those come secondary to your core curriculum classes. If you were high performing in junior high school and have completed some regents classes already, you’re usually put into AP classes.

"Initially, Danny Meyer was using a blend, but I can't remember of what exactly. I know there was brisket in there, but ultimately, the burgers were juicier, had much more flavor, and I believe they may have been griddled in butter, but again, I can't be too sure. This chain truly did begin as a shack in the middle of a park and by a guy who had an established reputation in the city with money to burn. Shake Shack was a phenomenon in the mid-00's. I remember their website had a feed you can watch just to check how long the line was. When Meyer decided to expand it was inevitable the product would suffer (that's usually the case with all business expansion), but I will give him credit for nailing the chicken sandwich and keeping pretty much everything else tip top. I love Shake Shack a whole lot and I frequently go to their ""test kitchen"" location on Varick to try new things not on the menu yet. But those first burgers at the one location were truly amazing and might even be responsible for the smash burger Renaissance in the city the past decade or so.",t2_s6g7v,FajitaTits,0,1648906870.0,0,t1_i33ux92,i33ux92,False,Wholesome100and7,t3_ttnnod,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/ttnnod/best_place_in_brooklyn_to_grab_a_milkshake/,Best place in Brooklyn to grab a milkshake?,/r/Brooklyn/comments/ttnnod/best_place_in_brooklyn_to_grab_a_milkshake/i33ux92/,1,r/Brooklyn,0,1

"Request for an itemized receipt. 

When you see the receipt, you can pay for the door only and not the contractor's time.

In court, there's a saying, ""Money doesn't leave one hand without a receipt going into the other.""

When you get the receipt, make sure it matches the exact door. You need to see name of door and model. Then, you can take it to a local retailer to match price and also get expert opinions. 

If the price is price gouged, you should pay the price for the exact match of the door to your landlord, minus their contractor's fee. 

Shared responsibilities: Landlord pays for contractor's time. You pay for door replacement. 

This could proceed into a lawsuit. There's a chance you could win if you present a strong case. Lots of work. But that's what make this stuff fun! 

Landlord will have to prove to the court the door cost exactly as they quoted. If not, they could answer to the judge and probably see their charge significantly decreased to bits and pieces and also face punative damages if the judge sees fit.

"if the damage assessed cost more than your security deposit you’re losing the whole thing. lmao don’t try and game the system, that’s scamming.

also, it’s not even debatable l, you even said what it would be, it’s totally gross negligence. fire department being “overly” cautious is exactly how they should be. if it turned into a fire, tenant would be responsible for a lot more than just a metal door which aren’t cheap. plus labor which means you need to used a licensed contractor, not just you fixing the lock and thinking it’s okay, the landlord would lose coding on the building if he allowed that, which also brings in the cost of paying for inspection, making sure the door was installed properly.

tenants always just think it’s just a cost of a door and nothing more, a lot more costs associated than just replacing a door and lock lol.

"Do you know this or are you assuming?


Untangling where the responsibility belongs in a rental home fire can be complicated. The fire’s damage requires multiple insurance policies. Understanding the terms of your insurance policy is the key to knowing what to expect in the event of a fire. It’s possible that both your insurance and the insurance purchased by your tenants will pay for different types of damage from the same fire. The breakdown of who pays for fire damage in a rental home may include these parties.

Landlord/Owner’s Insurer

As a property owner, you are responsible for fire damage related to the structure of the building. Your should cover damage to the building, including plumbing, electrical, and even appliances provided with the rental home like a stove and refrigerator. Thus, check your policy to ensure appliance coverage.

Tenant’s Insurer

As a landlord, you are not responsible for your tenants’ possessions. That’s why it’s important for your tenants to purchase a renter’s insurance policy to protect their possessions. Your tenant’s insurer will cover damages to all covered belongings like personal items, furniture, electronics, and clothing. It’s always a good idea to purchase rental insurance with your rental agreements when a tenant moves in.

Renter’s Insurance

If your tenant fails to purchase renter’s insurance, they are responsible for the cost of their damaged belongings. Additionally, if the tenant (or a guest of the tenant) is responsible for starting the fire, they may be responsible for paying the landlord’s deductible on damages to the building.

Landlord Insurance

If your negligence caused the fire, and you have no liability insurance, you’ll be paying out-of-pocket if your tenant decides to sue. Additionally, if your insurance has gaps that leave you without the proper coverage, you may be stuck paying for all the damage yourself.",t2_3tsad,bottom,0,1648855753.0,0,t1_i31p6v8,i31p6v8,False,[deleted],t3_tu1glk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/tu1glk/charged_6000_for_apt_door_replacement/,"Charged $6,000 for apt door replacement",/r/Brooklyn/comments/tu1glk/charged_6000_for_apt_door_replacement/i31p6v8/,3,r/Brooklyn,0,3

"Incidents like there are usually reported on by the local papers.. you linked the nypost, I’m sure daily news also headlined this, I know the NYT also had an article on it. In NYC high profile shootings like these are often heavily covered .. remember the baby girl who was grazed by a bullet in January? There was  also a toddler who was grazed by a bullet outside a daycare, and a 12 year old grazed by a bullet outside a housing project last week. All of these were all over the papers in the days after. Typically follows a cycle - initial reporting, interview of family/community members, politicians decrying the violence, then follow up if the shooter was arrested/ tried. They simply don’t make national news unless extremely exceptional.

"Youre right to point this out. 
My opinion, as a born and bred NYer who has lived in Manhattan and Brooklyn in good areas and in very bad areas, is that the problem youre addressing (and rightly so) exists for 2 reasons.

1. If the media/political machine (interchangeable terms imo) covers a story involving black on black crime, for instance, they risk having to then address it as a reality. Media/political machine needs to keep that kind of violence that occurs everyday and has been through generational socio-economic divides and conditioning out of sight, out of mind, in order to keep the cycle going. 

2. Stories like this do not suit the divide and conquer goal.
Media/political machine needs to constantly demonstrate and reinforce to the public that we are divided - which then separates us all. 
Black on black crime doesn't support that.
White on Black, Black on White, Hispanic on Asian, male on female...these are the stories that are nationally covered. Why?

This is how you keep a nation divided - by constantly reinforcing that there is an ""other"" and that ""other"" is an enemy. 

I'm not naive. I know there is racially motivated violence. 
But when you really start to track what stories local and national news choose to highlight and compare them to actual crime statistics, it becomes very clear there's a problem.
If you've lived in high crime areas, you know. 
There's a huge disparity between reality and what the media/political machine chooses to report/weaponize. 

It's been like this for [decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird).

"Bad press, unionization happening at that spot/the fight continuing, and (I'm not a lawyer) it looks a bit tricky when it comes to shutting down a business instead of unionizing.

https://laborlaw.foxrothschild.com/2017/11/articles/general-labor-law-news-updates/one-response-to-union-organizing-shut-down-completely/

>In general, the National Labor Relations Act prevents businesses from retaliating against employees for engaging in protected activities, including voting to join a union. However, **the United States Supreme Court held in 1965 that closing a business in response to union activity is “not the type of discrimination which is prohibited by the Act.”** Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co., 380 U.S. 263 (1965). In Darlington, the Court essentially found that the law does not reach the act of purposefully liquidating a business because restraining a business from taking such an action was too “startling … [to] entertain.” Fundamentally, **the rule announced in Darlington is premised on the rationale that an employer that leaves the sphere of business entirely does not gain any advantage by shedding union-represented employees.** While this rule may sound odd, given that employers cannot discriminate against employees for their union activities, the law simply does not prevent an employer from going out of business, even when the closing is based solely on anti-union sentiment.

>As is usually the case, there are exceptions to this rule. An employer cannot close a facility due to union activity in order to inhibit unionization at other plants. One can imagine a situation where a non-union employer with multiple facilities closes the first plant to unionize in order to make a statement to all of its employees. Where a decision to close is based on anti-union animus and aimed at employees at other locations, such a closing will be deemed to be unlawful.

So if I understand it correctly because Starbucks has thousands of locations, shutting down in response to union organizing could be illegal since the company would not be going out of business and would remain in the sphere of ""coffee retail."" A company can't be forced to stay open if it unionized, so Starbucks as an entity could choose to dissolve itself, but there is a strong argument to be made that closing individual business would be a retaliatory, and therefore illegal, practice.",t2_7tt3v,TheeSweeney,0,1648758897.0,0,t1_i2w8rzv,i2w8rzv,False,Patterson9191717,t3_tszip9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brooklyn/comments/tszip9/brooklyn_starbucks_workers_and_socialists_join/,Brooklyn Starbucks Workers and Socialists Join Forces to Fight Union-Busting,/r/Brooklyn/comments/tszip9/brooklyn_starbucks_workers_and_socialists_join/i2w8rzv/,11,r/Brooklyn,0,11

"i have one friend who works at a machine workshop and he's part of a union. i asked him about unions and how they work because I've been wanting to learn more about it. evidently his particular union is ""corrupt"" and takes monthly union dues out of every employees' paychecks and all they do is make sure people cannot get fired without prior notice. i asked why he cant leave the union and he mentioned if he leaves the union, the union will get him fired from the job lol. it sounds like extortion to me... apparently the union rep hasn't been at his location for over 3 years and they never respond to any of his calls or emails to ask for details about his union rights either. 

now... this OBVIOUSLY doesn't mean all unions are bad, but if unions are meant to protect the workers that's great, but what exactly are the Starbucks employees looking for protection from? are they overworked and underpaid?

"I used to have pretty a pricey gym membership but canceled it at the beginning of 2019. I bought an elliptical, a set of weights, and a nice exercise mat, and I actually work out more now than I did before. The purchases have paid for themselves many times over. Massages are a great way to spend the available cash, and you can incentivize yourself to work out by only indulging in a massage if you've met your workout quota for the week. My advice would be to invest only in the equipment you currently use at the gym. If you're not super into spin classes, don't buy a Peloton. If you're not a runner now, don't pretend that owning a treadmill will turn you into someone who enjoys running. Be honest with yourself and buy the things you'll actually use, even if they're more expensive.
