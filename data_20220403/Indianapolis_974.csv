•Boutiques all along Massachusetts Ave downtown (“Mass Ave”)
•Edinburgh outlet mall (about 45 mins south of downtown)

•Livery (Latin)
•Futuro (best pizza I’ve had in my life)

•Kavka coffee (inside Castleton mall. The only oat milk I’ve ever had that I liked!)

Drinks

•Tappers (drinks aren’t special but it’s a fun arcade bar)
•16 bit (another arcade bar)
•Pins (duckpin bowling bar, though they actually have good specialty drinks as well)
•450 Brewing (in Columbus 45 mins south of downtown . Worth the drive) 
•Oliver winery (in Bloomington a little over an hour or so from Indy)

Random things
•Newfields (art museum)

"A lot of ""bars"" that do pub trivia are really bar/restaurants that are all-ages venues.

Personally, I like the [Challenge Entertainment](https://challengeentertainment.com/) games. They have a slower paced format than some other games (one question at a time vs. a sheet of 6-10 questions per round), which means fewer questions per game but more time to actually socialize with your teammates. Whether that's a plus or a minus is up to your taste.

CE has games at quite a few locations around the city on different nights of the week. I'd say more than half of their locations are all-ages, but unfortunately the CE website doesn't say which are all-ages and which are 21+; you'd have to look up an individual site you're interested in on their own website or Yelp etc.",t2_bagvq,icecreamkoan,0,1648936777.0,0,t1_i35n2xq,i35n2xq,True,bad_card,t3_tumrad,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/tumrad/is_there_any_place_that_does_trivia_for_families/,Is there any place that does trivia for families?,/r/indianapolis/comments/tumrad/is_there_any_place_that_does_trivia_for_families/i35n2xq/,1,r/indianapolis,0,1

"Related: IPS School #3 (Lucretia Mott School) at 23 N Rural was heading for the same fate in the 80s.

The first major renovation (I’m guessing somewhere in the early 90s?) was done as a joint project between the Englewood Christian Church next door and Wheeler Mission, to adapt the school to life as a women’s shelter.

In 2009, Wheeler donated the building to the Englewood Community Development Corporation (ECDC). ECDC began the second round of major renovations (far more extensive than even the first) and converted the building to the Commonwealth Apartments. The apartments are a mix of market value and subsidized housing. It is one of the many ways that ECDC is working to provide affordable housing even as gentrification begins creeping through east side neighborhoods.

"April 1st 2022....also ironically April Fools's Day. This is an update. So yesterday on March 31st, Lt. Brett Keith, the official who handles citizen complaints on officers, advised me his investigation and report regarding the conduct of Officer Mike Miller was finished and that he could send it to me, but that he wanted me to answer some additional questions. I advised him I would only communicate in writing because I didn't accept his attempts to intimidate me or compel me to change my view of the situation. He had already been advised not to contact me again by phone and only be email just the day prior on March 30th, 2022.  So when he called me again on the morning of the 31st, I kept it very short and advised him I would only accept the report by email. I called back to the station and asked for his supervisor since Lt Keith seemed unwilling to send me the report to me until I spoke with him directly and I sent a follow-up email to Lt Keith reiterating that I would only accept a report by email. I was told over the phone that his supervisor was Major Johnathan Foster. I tried reaching his supervisor a couple of times during the day to get a copy of the report emailed. Lt. Keith wasn't sending it and Major Foster would not return my calls March 31st or April 1st. I have recordings of the voicemails I left for Major John Foster. They claimed my email wasn't working, so I decided to just show up and get a copy of the report. I called (while recording) a few minutes before 2ish this afternoon and advised I would be coming to get a copy of the report at the station. This is what the video shows. In total, it took roughly half an hour of talking and waiting to get a one page piece of paper that I will upload here, which indicates that the Carmel Police have deemed my report to be  a false complaint. Notably, the report only references the allegation of racial profiling. It says nothing regarding the allegations I listed on my complaint form about police harassment or any other categories I listed. Very curious. There was a lot of waiting time at the station and I brought a friend who lives in Carmel as a witness in case the department decided they didn't like all my questions. so I also cut out our in between conversations.  I want to thank everyone who has supported me in this. The fight is not over. I am not surprised they deemed the report to be false. I have filed reports in the past on officers and they never find wrongdoing. I simply did the report as a formality to build my case.

"Built in 1924, IPS School #1, also known as George Rogers Clark, sits in the Forest Manor neighborhood of Indy. It served as an elementary school for the area and also had 5th-8th grade students from other schools, as it operated as a magnet school in the early years of STEM implementation into public schools. The George Rogers Clark name came from the Revolutionary War brigadier general that travelled through the area and apparently camped near where the school stands today.

IPS #1 expanded with the Forest Manor neighborhood, which grew to be one of the largest neighborhoods in Indianapolis by the 1950's. The 60's saw a big shift demographically, with African-American's starting to move into the neighborhood and whites moving out, mostly to the Carmel area. The population in Forest Manor and IPS #1 declined in the 1970's, and by 1982 the school was officially closed.

The building was temporarily used by a church outreach program, but it was vacated a few years later, apparently after a water pipe burst in the basement. Talk of turning the school into apartments was proposed in the 90's but IPS #1 continues to sit vacant to this day.

The last time I saw IPS #1 it was in a pretty bad state, and that was a few years ago. Every window is either busted or boarded up. The roof leaked in several places and the basement was completely flooded. It had been long raided by scrappers and nothing is left there, it's completely gutted. Still, it was interesting seeing how big the school is, it gives a good sense of just how many students were there at one time. It's also not the first IPS #1, the original was built in the 1870's and was located at East Vermont and North New Jersey Streets (it's now a parking lot).

"I cringe at the downvotes, but let me offer up one realistic scenario we've started to see.

The Indiana Chamber opposes legalization because of the burden on employers. The Legislature and Governor's office, no matter the individuals, have always favored whatever business wants over individuals.

Presumably the issue for employers is in HR, testing, increased costs for testing, figuring out thresholds (like Nevada) and the insurance and liability nightmare that comes with some positions being high or not. Indiana has a huge number of manufacturing and warehouse jobs compared to most other states, even our neighbors. And forklift drivers, truck drivers, people operating heavy machinery, etc. can't be high on the job.

Nevada has shown some guidance on this by setting thresholds for how high is too high, how recently a person smoked, etc. and the remnants of that in their system. It's akin to alcohol insofar you can drink, but don't come to work drunk. I think employers and the Chamber likely view this as another thing they just don't want to deal with, no matter how accessible the testing. I suspect, too, they may fear it's harder to tell who is high and how high they are vs. being drunk, which is more recognizable to people.

These are all completely solvable issues with smart, clear policy. But the answer to OP's question on ""what excuse will Indiana use?"" is likely ""it's a big burden on employers."" Especially if our neighbors legalize it, there's probably enough manufacturers or blue collar workplaces in Michigan, Illinois, etc. Republicans can point to and say, ""Look, these places looked at Indiana and said, ""That seems easier to manage in Indiana. I should just move. This is good for jobs.""",t2_4aos0,jlharter,0,1648899333.0,0,t1_i33io9w,i33io9w,True,PositivelyIndiana,t3_tu4put,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/tu4put/lets_pretend_cannabis_is_decriminalized_federally/,let's pretend cannabis is decriminalized federally--,/r/indianapolis/comments/tu4put/lets_pretend_cannabis_is_decriminalized_federally/i33io9w/,7,r/indianapolis,0,7

"I’m currently renting from Alpine leasing so I deal directly with the leasing agency and never talk to the owner, I don’t even know who they are. On March 30th I went down to the basement to do laundry and there was a pool of sewage coming up from the floor drain. I go down there pretty frequently so I know it couldn’t have been like that for long. I contacted maintenance by phone and email and they emailed be back on March 31st saying they put a work order in and that a contractor will contact me directly to set ab appt. My issue is that this is super unsanitary, a major inconvenience and the sewage is up to my washer and dryer so I’m afraid they may become damaged. I feel like this is an emergency and I should not have had to wait longer than 24-48 hours for this issue to be resolved. Am I correct in thinking that? In my lease it says any work I do to the house can be deducted from rent so I’m thinking I may hire a plumber on my own. Wondering if anyone here has an idea of how much something like that would cost. Water seems to drain fine except for maybe the tub. Toilet also flushes fine.

"It's really only Marion County that has stopped chasing marijuana as an official policy. The DA has said they won't prosecute cases involving marijuana under a certain amount. Beyond that, most of the state will still happily charge you with marijuana. I think there are more counties who unofficially don't care unless you're being ridiculous.

I also personally think Marion County's public decision to not prosecute marijuana cases has actually hurt legalizing marijuana efforts in Indiana. We have a vocal minority who manage to elect state reps who then go to the statehouse and propose making delta 8 illegal.

I agree with the decision to not prosecute those crimes. I just think it rubs the ""Indianapolis is a liberal shit hole and ruining the state"" crowd the wrong way and then we get stupid bills that only affect Indianapolis as a bit of punishment.",t2_k5cq6,cait_Cat,0,1648863791.0,0,t1_i3254xr,i3254xr,False,PositivelyIndiana,t3_tu4put,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/tu4put/lets_pretend_cannabis_is_decriminalized_federally/,let's pretend cannabis is decriminalized federally--,/r/indianapolis/comments/tu4put/lets_pretend_cannabis_is_decriminalized_federally/i3254xr/,9,r/indianapolis,0,9

Possession of a small amount of marijuana is like a half a step above a ticket.  The jail in the county I used to work for rarely had a possession case in the jail.  You would see it in the event that someone was on probation and violated that, then violated house arrest, and would then go on to violate work release.  But those were very few and far between, especially after 2014.  About 2015/2016 many of the jails in Indiana were overcrowded and possession cases would ultimately be a ticket or a summons.

"It depends entirely on the HOA.  I've lived in neighborhoods where I really wished we had one.  It was a starter home for me and we had issues with people having broken down cars sitting on the street forever, or piles of debris sitting on the lawn for months at a time. 

Conversely, I have friends who live in neighborhoods (in Carmel, of course) where they constantly focus on petty nonsense.  One of them got a crappy letter because they didn't have enough flowers around the base of their mailbox.  Fuck off with that.

I'm the president of the HOA where I live now and everyone is cool.  The only reason we have meetings is to discuss common area maintenance and budgeting.  At the end of the day, the goal is to help maintain property values and quality of life for residents.  I think most people can agree that those are reasonable goals, but there are certainly folks out there who get some kind of pathetic power trip from bossing around their neighbors.",t2_97n2iz1v,ChickenFlats,0,1648840567.0,0,t1_i30qx72,i30qx72,False,Duck_Hunter_117,t3_ttwvsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/ttwvsq/any_tips_for_getting_solar_approved_in_hoa_with/,Any tips for getting Solar approved in HOA with HB 1196 now passed?,/r/indianapolis/comments/ttwvsq/any_tips_for_getting_solar_approved_in_hoa_with/i30qx72/,7,r/indianapolis,0,7

‘Does freezing gun remove DNA’: Teen’s online searches used to charge him with 3 murders
Sarah Nelson
Indianapolis Star






‘Does freezing a gun remove DNA?’ ‘Homicide lawyer cost?’ ‘How long does it take police to get phone logs?’ 

Those were questions police allege 16-year-old Caden Smith searched online in the week after the bodies of three people were found by an off-duty officer in a “remote area” off I-465.

The internet searches, along with Smith's communication with the victims and firearms evidence, are part of the information Marion County prosecutors on Friday used to charge Smith with murder more than two months after the deaths,according to a probable cause affidavit.    

The investigation began when an off-duty Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officer who was working part-time security at a construction site saw the bodies of two young men on a path north of the area, along with several bullet casings.  

More:16-year-old charged in October triple killing near Meridian and I-465, prosecutor says

The officer called for more police to the scene in the 4400 block of South Meridian Street. While they searched for evidence, they found the third young man’s body in tall grass around 40 yards away.  

The Marion County coroner’s office identified them as Joseph Thomas, 18, Michael James, 22, and Abdulla Mubarak, 17. All three died from gunshot wounds to the head.  

Crime Scene specialists collected over 50 fired 9-mm casings, records said.  

The victim’s families told detectives in interviews they last saw Thomas, James and Mubarak between a day or two before police found their bodies. Detectives searched James’ iPad and found a conversation with him and an unknown profile asking to meet up to “test that switch...” and mentions taking a “path to a field” because a “highway blocks the shots.”  

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD) officers continue Wednesday, Oct. 13, 2021, investigating a triple homicide in a ""remote area"" just off South Meridian Street near the I-465 overpass. 
Detectives later learned at least one of the victims discussed meeting with Smith to obtain a switch for a gun.   

A switch is an illegal device that turns a semi-automatic pistol to a machine gun, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  

Police obtained a search warrant for Smith’s home on Oct. 26 and Indianapolis’ SWAT also responded. Negotiators made announcements for 10 minutes with no answer. Just after 12:15 a.m., the unit threw a noise flash device in the front and back yard.

The SWAT team then flew a drone inside the home and parked it outside Smith’s bedroom. They sent aerosol gas through the window after breaking it.  

Smith left his room, walked out of the house and yelled at the SWAT officers to get a warrant, records said. Police said the 16-year-old refused to walk toward them at first until eventually agreeing to, but turned around to walk back inside the house. The officers then took him to the ground and placed him in handcuffs.  

More:Indianapolis police officer charged with drunken driving off duty that ended in crash

Detectives said they found two guns on Smith’s bed, a plastic baggie with unfired bullets, assault rifle modifiers, a bullet proof vest, six cell phones, more than 103 grams of methamphetamine, nearly 74 grams of marijuana and several pills.  

One of the phones police found inside a backpack showed more than 10 calls to and from Thomas’ phone number days before Thomas was found dead.  

In another cell phone, forensic analysts found online searches inquiring about what happens when an FBI takes over a homicide, the number of deaths considered to be a mass murder and Thomas’ missing status.  

A firearms examiner later linked the bullets from the victims to a pistol found from Smith’s bedroom.  

In addition to three counts of murder, prosecutors charged Smith with felony murder – defined as murder that took place during a felony. Smith is also charged with robbery, possession of a machine gun, possession of methamphetamine and marijuana and resisting law enforcement.  

He is charged as an adult.

"I've walked and biked a good portion of the Fishers portion of the trail. On its own...honestly, it isn't much. The only real destination on the route is downtown Fishers at 116th. It doesn't really run up to any other commercial nodes. Even when it extends to 96th Street, it'll be like...you know, fast food, and Peterson's, and the strip mall on the Indy side with Sam's Club. And that's about it.

It also goes through a fair amount of lighter industry. Even when we go up to the portion when it eventually hits 146th, its industrial and residential so there's not a lot of room for re-development here.

And until we get well into  Noblesville's downtown core, it is mostly empty and light industry as well.

I actually think Indy's portion of the nickel plate can lead to a lot more re-development. A lot more empty or underused strip malls there that are going to be easier to re-devleop than light industry or existing residential.

"theres a LOT of missing context behind those bullet points.

1. this was during his annual mardi gras party, a big part of mardi gras in new orleans is the Zulu parade. hes FROM new orleans. he was dressed up like they do during the parade. its a whole thing down there. people didnt realize that, and blew it out of proportion.

2. they were robbed at gunpoint. in order to make themselves less likely to become a return victim, they advertised a discount for showing your gun permit. they didnt ask people to bring guns, or carry guns., he said he didnt want to SEE anyones guns. they just made it publicly known that theres the potential for people who are there to theoretically be armed as a deterrent to any would be robbers in the future.

3. not really much to add, husband and wife divorced, so they closed, and reopened as Mama Roux. She later got remarried, and decided to move on from the business as well, and closed shop permanently. 

im not excusing any of these things, clearly at face value they are some pretty bold decisions that probably werent for the best. but given the context they make a lot more sense.

With all due respect, and without any hostility, that is where you are wrong. In many industries, not just music, there is resentment against those who use PR to get attention/publicity/concert venues when they otherwise don’t deserve them. 

Did you know about Andrea Bocelli aside from his visual impairment? Or in any other way since he did that Las Vegas hotel commercial? In short, did anyone know about him purely from his vocal skills? I bet the answer is “no.” How many other classical singers can you name who could come to sing with the ISO? (Any? I bet not. Please tell me, if so, because I probably know them.) 

So this is just a cheap PR moment to make Indy folks feel good about themselves for getting some “high culture” when they are just getting scammed by a PR machine. Don’t go. Don’t let your friends go. Instead, go to one of the regular ISO concerts, and support our local, highly-trained musicians without the giant PR machine of Andrea Bocelli. And if you avoid this event, it will send a message to the ISO programming office not to continue to program these events in future (I guarantee that my ISO colleagues are already rolling their eyes about this event; please support them and not these cheesy special events.)",t2_37er3kw5,BonnieIndigo,0,1648829609.0,0,t1_i2zzeg4,i2zzeg4,False,Tikkanen,t3_ttc8i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/ttc8i6/andrea_bocelli_to_perform_with_indianapolis/,Andrea Bocelli to perform with Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra in December,/r/indianapolis/comments/ttc8i6/andrea_bocelli_to_perform_with_indianapolis/i2zzeg4/,-1,r/indianapolis,0,-1

I would think that someone so passionate about the arts would support this kind of show though. It injects a bunch of revenue into the arts and likely allows the ISO to perform with the kind of acts which you would prefer which may not otherwise be possible.

At the end of the day Bocelli coming to perform could not affect your life less (in fact it may indirectly contribute to improving the arts scene and thus your ability to see what you'd be interested in), so why are you so aggressively coming in here calling people names and talking down to them just because they like something.

It is not. So people in Indy will go to this concert thinking they are experiencing high culture (and clapping themselves on the back for it afterwards, because let’s be real, no one who is going to that concert actually wants to critically appraise Andrea Bocelli) when they actually didn’t.

"I attended a meeting with IMPD a few weeks again on the public safety camera and had meant to post this, but I still haven't gotten my written notes together -- having talked about it this in several meetings, I realize it is PRETTY MUCH just this subredd that I need to be written for!

I asked for the presentation after and posted to my website -- yes mods, if you want to complain that the title doesn't match the URL, I can change the website if you want!

There are a few things I liked when talking to East District Cmd'r Riddle and Assistant Chief Chris Bailey -- this is a chain of custody on all videos.  No one can just 'ask to look at them' and no one is allowed to use the videos just for a 'fishing expedition' in most cases...if someone is smoking weed, or getting into a fistfight or something like this...it cannot be the sole reason to arrest someone.  Pretty much, if an officer didn't see it in person, it can only be evidence for something else.  

We discussed retention policies -- and the fact that by state law, we aren't allowed to have 'red light cameras' or 'speed cams'.  It's to say some cities don't have these...but if you ever get an automated ticket...hmmm....talk to a lawyer!

Secondly, we spoke about over-policing in neighborhoods where violence happens.  Talked about how when a felony crime happens in a neighborhood hundreds of calls come through, most are very ambiguous in the description (purposely) and as such, officers have to kinda look into EVERYONE.  Note, I'm not claiming I agree with this, I'm saying this is their argument for pulling everyone over.  The claim is, with these cameras, they have more immediate and evidence-based descriptions -- with license plate cameras, they can quickly see what cars have been statistically around other crimes and target those as opposed to every one.  

One set of slides missing showed a crime ring around the city that was broken by a license plate camera and was able to catch the ring in the middle of attempted homicide.  

PERSONALLY, I still hate the idea of being surveilled.  I hate the idea that my travels are recorded throughout the city -- and if I'm not a target of an investigation, I don't want my license plate recorded for any longer than it takes to say ""NOPE NOT HIM"".  And I know a lot of others that feel the same.  I say this paradoxically knowing my social media can tell you where I am most days of the week, but that's on me and not the city.

"I'm gonna pipe in a bit late here because for whatever reason the inside people decided to be vocal on this post.

The Garage or Bottleworks district as a whole is a great food vibe. I can kill hours just people watching there. 

City Market is a great vibe spot for the same reason but a different crowd and also much more relaxed atmosphere.

Indy Vinyl in Broadripple is honestly a great music vibe, it is so rare that you can go to a record store that still has an ACTIVE shopping base. You know? You don't feel awkward being just one guy in a store while the guy behind the counter just sits there. This place is usually busy after work or on weekends and you can browse and talk music for hours.

And even though this may seem like an obvious one, enough people don't consider it that I feel the need to say it. Just go down to Monument Circle and sit around the monument for a minute. Eat lunch, drink a coffee, or bring a book. But like....take that atmosphere in. The fountains, the traffic, the monument itself, the music from the speakers.

"On the morning of Monday, March 28th, 2022 at approximately 6:00a.m., Officer Mike Miller of the Carmel Police Department approached my vehicle where I was legally parked, awake and alert and seated in the passenger side of my car. I saw him shining his flashlight and I turned the car battery on to allow myself to roll the driver's side window down. I initiated the interaction by asking the officer what I could help him with. He asked, ""Are you homeless or something?"" I find this to be a racially motivated question. I replied no. I stated to him I am an Uber Eats Driver, just parked  while I wait for morning orders to begin for a bit. He advised me that the reason he was profiling me was that I happen to be parked near a bank. I would like to know which statutes, ordinances or laws prohibit one from being parked on a public street close to a bank. Officer Miller stated he needed my ID. I advised him I have never robbed a bank. I said, ""For being legally parked on a public street?"" He laughed nervously and said yeah. That is when I requested a supervisor. Officer Miller advised that I had to sit tight. Because of this unlawful detainment, I sat and awaited a supervisor so that I could resolve what possible reason he could have for detaining me. During this time while I waited for the supervisor to arrive, officer Miller took it upon himself too wrongfully run my ID without cause. It was at this point I began to film. When officer Sean Brady arrived, I could hear him conversing with officer Miller behind my vehicle. I surmised from this conversation that there was no probable cause whatsoever to question or detain me. I was also able to determine that it appeared officer Brady could also not understand the reason for this racially motivated interaction. So I let my window down and loudly requested that the supervisor come speak with me. Upon speaking with Officer Brady, I was able to determine that there was no probable cause for such racially bigoted and unlawful behavior on the part of the initial officer Miller. I confirmed with officer Brady that I had broken no laws. I confirmed with officer Brady that I was indeed legally parked on a public street. I gathered his and officer Miller's identifying information and advised I would be making a complaint. I have footage of the incident. I am very well the officers were wearing body cameras and the department should also have footage, which I will be legally requesting through an attorney at the appropriate time.",t2_k1uuampt,Evening-ghost,0,1648811433.0,0,t1_i2yw4l4,i2yw4l4,True,[deleted],t3_tqgepp,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianapolis/comments/tqgepp/carmel_police_havent_changed_a_bit/,Carmel police haven't changed a bit.,/r/indianapolis/comments/tqgepp/carmel_police_havent_changed_a_bit/i2yw4l4/,1,r/indianapolis,0,1

"A pro is probably going to charge you an arm and a leg to do a scan.  There are some in town and that's a simply google away. 

New IPhones can scan.  I've toyed briefly with it on a family members phone by scanning the entire interior of their living room and kitchen.  It's fairly impressive, while not perfect either.  

https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=3d+print+an+iphone+scan

I think getting a good quality file to print will require manual touch ups and such, which could be very labor intensive depending on how the scan turns out and how perfect you need it to be.  There's also probably a bunch of prep to cover the windows and mirrors with masking tape because I assume you don't want to try to scan and print the interior as well, not to mention shiny stuff like windows, glass, or maybe even a good wax job might make scanning difficult.
