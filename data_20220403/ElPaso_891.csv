"What's with all the Flak.. Chicos Tacos isn't horrible it's not Amazing .. it's extremely Polarizing.. Either you Love it or You hate it . There's no in between. I personally Love it. Grew up eating it.. even in Sundays after church when I was a good boy.. or forced to go with my parents .. I don't want it all the time but I do get these random cravings that I assume are just built into my DNA . It's good. But that's Me . Everyone is different. 

My personal order . 
2 singles dry (Sauce on the side)
Fries. 
Iced Tea
Grilled Cheese
Side of government cheese. 

When I'm feeling super Fat ill swap the Grilled cheese for a Burger which is low key pretty good. It's a Mustard burger with lettuce and tomato.. legit..

Put ketchup on my fries, top it with the extra cheese and go to town with the jalapeno salsa they have . 

For those wondering . I get my sauce separate because I Love crunchy food . I don't mess with those soggy tacos .. once I understood why my dad did this . It changed my world!! 😱

"Don't know that I have a favorite.

Bowlero. Goony Golf far out on Dyer. And for that matter Putt Putt on Montana. Roller King. There was even a short-lived roller rink over by Rushing and Fairbanks but it was a little too small.

Western Playland at Ascarate was always a pretty dinky place compared to even smaller regional amusement parks but it felt like a place as opposed to the blacktop the Sunland Park version is. I remember having a birthday at the good one. Those waffle cones are seared into my mind.

Discovery Zone had such a cool jungle gym and the Men In Black laser tag near the end ignited my love for that. Was really happy when Bob-Os was built.

Tramway was fun even if as a kid going up to just see a tiny store wasn't particularly exciting. We had always had a pretty nice view of things already so it wasn't particularly remarkable.

Seeing the lights at UTEP during Christmas season. Watching Viva El Paso in middle school. Think I saw an Anne Frank play in Central in middle school as well. 

Golden Corral on Hondo Pass. Shopping at Furrs at Northgate. Going to the movies by the bus station at Northgate. Getting ice cream over by Supreme Bakery on Diana. Hondo Pass Blockbuster on Wednesday. Whataburger Wednesdays. Peter Pipers old location by Burrito House. 

Eating Grand China Buffet in the summer with my mom on her lunch break. Going to the discount theaters and libraries in the summer to cool off. Milling about McCoys while my dad got whatever supplies he needed. Great American steak for special occasions.

"There's a lot of good advice here even though it's Reddit. You should NEVER rush things or settle just because you think life is passing you by. I assure you that it is not. Also, keeping up with the Joneses is a very bad way to make decisions. Hopefully you don't want to get a house just because your friends or siblings have houses. Buying a dwelling is one of the biggest financial purchases you will make in your life, so this is something you MUST plan for and it will take time. As other posters have mentioned, you must have a stable income, save up for a down payment/closing costs, house insurance and have a home maintenance fund for inevitable repairs.

If you're renting then do not let people tell you that you are throwing money away. You are paying for a place to live and that's good enough. Due to my recent divorce, horrible credit and low income I am in no position to buy a house and may not be able to ever. It does not bother me because I may move out of town and I value having that flexibility.

"If you are single and OK with roommates, I would advise you to go that route and start saving aggressively. It's not a great time to buy a house right now, especially if you can't afford it.

Let's say a house costs you $2k/month. Find a place you can rent with roommates for $500 or so, and put $1500 aside each month. You'll quickly see how viable it is to afford that cost, without any real risk since you're just putting that money aside.

Once you reach a decent down payment + emergency fund saved up, then you can start shopping. Hopefully by then, prices will stabilize.

Without experience or a degree and just Comptia A+ certification you can easily get a tier 1 help desk remote job. Pay is usually between $18-$25 for that position. That position most people do for 6 months then move on to tier 3 which starts around $55,000.

"Sure! Almost all of them offer a ""tasting"" sampler which will get you 3-5 small glasses for around $10 total. Their tasting rooms are open to the public, usually from 12-5pm. This is my favorite because you get to try out several different styles that they make right there on site. The people there are very friendly and will help you discover wines that fit your taste. I really enjoy La Vina. Their wine is wonderful but the people there are just the best. They opened up their big grassy area to stretch out in which is great on cooler days. Zin Valle is a close second. Farther up the road is Rio Grande Winery which has by far the best atmosphere. The last time I went, the wine was just ok, but they're under new management now so I'd like to see how they've improved. All of these offer ""tasting"" flights, by the glass, or by the bottle.

It’s been about 20 years since I’ve been there, short of just a few random “passing through” drives and since I have an actual few days off figured I’d make the best of it but have zero clue where may be good to try.

Tagging /u/nickelsandvibes and /u/curiousthwy1970 since you also suggested Mad Jacks; maybe you have some suggestions for our evening meal.

"Yesterday I spent $140 at Wally World (Wal-Mart). There were a few higher ticket items, like 5 lbs. grated cheese, toilet paper, laundry detergent, and a 2.2 lb bag of coffee beans. These typically last longer than two weeks. The rest was staple items like OJ, eggs, tortillas, canned good, ketchup, loaf of bread, muffin mix, etc. I didn't buy meat or produce.

Today I spent about $44 at Food King for produce and other things.

I'd say that I am probably about $300 to $400 in a month all inclusive, which includes cleaning supplies, bathroom stuff (toothpaste, mouthwash, anti-cavity rinse), and food.

RE: food prep

I don't have an air fryer, but I do have a toaster oven. One of my favorites starts with an oversized tortilla, add refried beans on top, add salsa on top of that, then liberally add grated cheese.

"I guess it depends on where on the west side you plan to live. If you’re talking about older structures I’m thinking you mean closer to UTEP, which wouldn’t really be the west side so much,maybe west central? 

I lived near EP high school about six years ago and I liked the location, but I got a bigger house in better shape for similar prices to what I would have paid to be near UTEP or even on the west side. I think the only way I’d live out on the west side is if I could get a nice piece of land out in NM, but that’s pretty pricey in this market because property taxes are much cheaper in NM. 

I miss being close to the mountain, but I just can’t get over how little I drive out here.

"I live in the westside and work in downtown. The morning commute isn’t that bad. Leave home at 8:30 am and get to work before 9:00.

Mix the slaw with the bbq, and if you like it, put a little Texas Pete in there.

"Best things about El Paso would be leaving El Paso the fact that there's literally fast food joints everywhere because the only real thing to do down here is stuff your face and they have a city park that has a really shallow and littered and polluted pond that doesn't get up kept hardly at all.

The worst things about El Paso or in my experiences the people are hostile and friendly and often times depending on where you live criminal. The weather if it's not 110° out it's always blowing wind and sand
If you're an outdoorsman good luck finding public land here that's within the state of Texas sure you can pay more and go to Las Cruces but then if you're a hunter you have to deal with a lottery system that typically you're not going to win and if you're a fisherman good luck finding somewhere within 2 hours to go fishing unless you count that City Park I was mentioning earlier which is probably one of the worst places I've ever tried to fish as far as hiking and camping yeah that doesn't really exist here unless again you go to New Mexico or trespass on to someone's property.

"Originally from NC.

We don’t boil it, at least not the legit places. Maybe if you’re making it at home and don’t have a smoker you can cook it in a slow cooker/boil it. *True* Carolina barbecue is slow smoked for HOURS, and you constantly “mop” it with sauce while smoking it… then you let it rest for awhile after so it sits in its own juices. And then there’s 2 different scenes for the sauces - the vinegar based sauce (which I’m a fan of) and the ketchup based sauce.

Usually my first meal whenever I go visit back home is a big pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top, and a huge serving of hush puppies. Heaven.

"Taxes in Texas and EP are actually not that bad. I live in Charlotte Metro and here is a breakdown of the taxes I pay:

- Sales Tax 7.25% on everything except medicine
- Income Tax 7%
- Property Taxes $2400 for a 300k home
- Vehicle taxes $470 for a 30k vehicle, per year
- Storm water tax. When it rains we get taxed, a lot. 

We too have very little to show for it. Public transportation is expensive and unreliable, we frequently subsidize professional sports teams, and our transportation infrastructure within large metro areas is complete garbage. El Paso has 6 lane freeways, we have 3 lane freeways for a metroplex of 2.8 million.

Yeah but the new real estate they build would still cost more because of the new people coming in from places that had more expensive housing. Im trying to explain to you why people might not be thrilled about more people moving in. Since it will cause a housing price increase even if they build more houses which they are doing. I dont think its exactly theyre upset at the new people but more upset that prices will go up and resources for the city will be more spread thin.,t2_f5y2v2vc,UnusualRun375,0,1648132457.0,0,t1_i1xo7ks,i1xo7ks,False,[deleted],t3_tm34r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/tm34r7/why_are_so_many_people_moving_here_stop_plz_its/,why are so many people moving here?? stop plz? it's over populated enough thank you. it's a great place but won't be if all these people continue moving here :/,/r/ElPaso/comments/tm34r7/why_are_so_many_people_moving_here_stop_plz_its/i1xo7ks/,1,r/ElPaso,0,1

"Reason why, because even though El Paso is still safe...in the past recent years they have been an increase in violence, especially gun shootings. I don't mean to sound prejudice or racist or anything of that sort, but when a shooting would happen, you can bet your money it was a soldier or someone that came from out of town. Now the stupid younger generation from here are following suit. They think it is so rough out here they need to carry a gun. And reason being there has been a rise in people moving in from out of town, so more people more violents.",t2_2306flfu,surgeC,0,1648132147.0,0,t1_i1xnfwv,i1xnfwv,False,[deleted],t3_tm34r7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElPaso/comments/tm34r7/why_are_so_many_people_moving_here_stop_plz_its/,why are so many people moving here?? stop plz? it's over populated enough thank you. it's a great place but won't be if all these people continue moving here :/,/r/ElPaso/comments/tm34r7/why_are_so_many_people_moving_here_stop_plz_its/i1xnfwv/,2,r/ElPaso,0,2
