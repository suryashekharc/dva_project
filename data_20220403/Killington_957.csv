"Yes there is! I went to Killington earlier this year, and did a thorough google search looking for lift ticket discounts. All coupon codes were dead ends, but on the second or third page of google results I found an ancient Reddit post asking this very question, which had to different informative responses! From that I found there are now two different places that one can get a discounted lift ticket (approx 30% off). 

1. You can buy discounted lift ticket vouchers from REI. If you had more time, you could have REI ship the voucher to your home for free... but as you're going this weekend, you will have to go to an REI store to pick up the voucher in person. Note, when ordering, you must specify which REI store you will pick up at. https://www.rei.com/product/834706/killington-resort-adult-lift-ticket

2. You can buy discounted lift ticket vouchers from the Potter Bros ski shop. Here too, you can have the voucher mailed to you, or can pick up in person at the ski shop. They have a branch in Killington as well as one near Poughkeepsie, NY. https://www.potterbrothers.com/tickets/

In either case, you redeem the voucher by one of these methods:
a. If you already have a Killington RFID card, you go onto their web site, log in to your account, enter the RFID card number, then enter the voucher number and ""load"" it onto the card

b. If you don't already have a Killington RFID card, you get one from the customer service desk at Killington ($5 I think) and then load the voucher onto that. (I don't know if they can load the voucher for you at the desk, or if you have to buy the card and then use your phone to load the voucher onto it.)

Postscript: In years past, I was able to get Killington vouchers at Costco, but (a) you had to buy a 3-pack of adult ticket vouchers, and (b) Costco doesn't have those this year.",t2_3ctlf,SaxTeacher,0,1647470315.0,0,t1_i0y1eb5,i0y1eb5,True,Choice-Aioli-5225,t3_tfqqwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Killington/comments/tfqqwg/looking_for_a_ticket_for_march_20th/,Looking for a ticket for March 20th.,/r/Killington/comments/tfqqwg/looking_for_a_ticket_for_march_20th/i0y1eb5/,1,r/Killington,0,1

"The 60 year old K1/KBL Lodge will close for good next Sunday about 6pm. A substantial party is planned for that afternoon. There is even a countdown clock in Mahogany Ridge, the bar on the lower level closest to Superstar. The entire building will be demolished. 

The building under construction behind it will be extended to cover about half the KBL footprint and a substantial deck extending slope side in front of that. Scheduled completion is in November, in time for the Women’s World Cup Race over Thanksgiving weekend.

"Despite VT not getting the low temps and snow that they got some decades ago, typically there is a good amount of man made snow runs open by late December.   Snowmaking technology and budgets are massive compared to the past, especially since they started hosting the women's World Cup races.  Christmas to New Years is one of the busiest times at the mountain so they make every effort to have a lot of terrain open.  However, you are still at the mercy of Mother Nature.  Warm temps and rain can ruin even the most heroic snowmaking efforts.  Typically, I find mid-late December has at least a good number of man made groomed runs, so I break out my ice skis and start bombing down low crowded trails, especially superstar and cascade. If natural snow falls its all a bonus.  I have never been up there for Christmas week as it not in my family's plans and the cost and crowds are too much, but leading up to it can be good as long as you still realize its relatively early season for VT.",t2_d71zn,Amity83,0,1634780861.0,0,t1_hhfuxfd,hhfuxfd,True,SandPajamas,t3_pmazsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Killington/comments/pmazsi/conditions_towards_end_of_december/,Conditions towards end of December,/r/Killington/comments/pmazsi/conditions_towards_end_of_december/hhfuxfd/,1,r/Killington,0,1

">I am about ski at killington tomorrow for the 27th time this season and  am expecting a lot of crowds due to it being a Saturday, let alone one  of the last good skiing weekends of the year. However, I have noticed  recently that k1 lines have been unusually long. I am in line there  sometimes and usually over half the gondolas have only one person in  each a cabin. This undoubtedly is causing lift lines to move slower. The  same issue is happening at other lifts sporadically, but 95% of the  time I see this, it happens at k1.

Vermont COVID regulations for ski areas. They can shut K down. Since you've been here 27 times, you should well aware of that by now.

>Another concern is that there has also been a large amount of  inexperienced kids on steeper trails like wildfire, superstar, and East  fall. I’m not trying to act like a Karen or anything like that, but this  is making it fairly dangerous on busier days when so many kids are  doing pizzas at less than 5 miles an hour down the whole trail that they  literally form a blockade across the entire trail. Their turns are also  unpredictable and this makes any attempt at trying to pass them very  risky. This has resulted in it taking me 15 minutes to go down one trail  and often results in giant traffic jams further up the trail. What’s  even more unusual is that the  snowshed area is almost EMPTY nowadays,  even on holiday weekends. I don’t know why this is but either way, kids  have been making the mountain more dangerous on certain parts. Hopefully  I have described what others have seen there too.

I find it hard to believe you are having trouble getting around \*anyone\* on Wildfire, Superstar, or (Lower) East Fall. They're boulevards, except Superstar, which is more like an 8 lane highway.

"Depends on what you’re looking for. Killington has some of the largest terrain parks I have ever seen, and there are 8 of them! Any terrain park is good, but if you’re looking for the biggest jumps go to Dream Maker over by bear mountain. They have the largest jumps and it’s super easy to get a load of speed on them. If you’re looking for a good trail in general, my personal recommendations include skyeburst, cascade, and outer limits. The first two are almost always groomed and are good trails in general, but outer limits is usually very steep moguls and are frequently icy when open. However, as of the time I am writing this, they have snowmaking going on rn so I’m gonna try and get the first tracks there tomorrow. If you are looking for the longest run possible, take the k1 gondola to the summit and take bear trax until you reach snowshed crossover, where you should take that trail over to cruise control until you find great eastern. It is a rather flat trail but takes you to the valley below killington to a gondola that takes you back up. The total length of that run is almost 5 miles long. These are just my personal opinions, and killington usually grooms everything at this time of year when there is almost no powder left, so any groomed trail is good during early spring.",t2_7e4suqmb,Killington-Hobo,0,1615006652.0,0,t1_gpva7hz,gpva7hz,True,Ozzmeisterfest,t3_lrxnuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Killington/comments/lrxnuf/hows_the_snow_any_particularly_recommended_trails/,How’s the snow ❄️?

"You should be fine. Snowdon is part of their delayed opening plan (Nov 14) and it is mostly blue. They tend to delay on the double blacks because they require more snow making coverage.

"There are plenty of runs on the mountain for all skill levels.  Hopefully there will be lots of snow for you in December.  There are also a number of parks, progressing from beginner to advanced, more so than most mountains I’ve seen.  

There are plenty of great restaurants on Killington Rd., but they can get pricey for a months stay.  I particularly love The Garlic.  Rutland, which is 20 min west on Rte 4, has the less expensive/ fast food options.  Rutland also has more traditional super markets, but the ones in Killington carry all of the basics in a pinch.  

Also take some time to check out the area.  There’s Ludlow, home to Okemo mountain and Woodstock, a picturesque New England town.  Queechee Gorge, Rte 4 East, is pretty cool to see also.

"I've done this the past couple of years, going from late Dec-Jan.

It can be a bit of a crap shoot with the weather but by late November they will most likely be top-bottom with a fair number of blue run open (~6 or so, mostly on the north ridge). Maybe a little more this year since the world cup isn't happening, so more snowmaking capacity could be available in general instead of blasting superstar non-stop.

It can take some time for green trails to open up, but I wouldn't let that stop you.

"Hello. A group of 8 of us just visited killington.  We rented a Airbnb for a extra long weekend. We were very close to town with shuttle service running to and from the lifts all day long.  Also a ski home trail. At night if you are interested in bars they have shuttle services for that as well. We stayed at trail creek condos. 

If your interest in the unit we stayed in please PM me for more information!!",t2_52ewzl9h,Evol14570,0,1581191861.0,0,t1_fgz8kmr,fgz8kmr,True,[deleted],t3_f0wl2d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Killington/comments/f0wl2d/trip_planning/,Trip Planning,/r/Killington/comments/f0wl2d/trip_planning/fgz8kmr/,2,r/Killington,0,2

Having a car would be ideal, it doesn’t cost anything to park at the mountain. I would recommend mountain sports inn, they have reasonable prices. 

There’s a lot of good places to go for apres, like the lookout, sushi yoshi, etc..the mountain even has live music at Bear! 

The grocery store in killington is kind of expensive, so I would recommend grabbing some groceries before you get there or snag some in Rutland.

March is excellent! There’s scanners now so it’s really hard to do the buddy pass system. Sometimes people sell tickets on Craigslist though!

"Killington has some excellent gladed terrain, but not a lot of glades that are so mellow as those (i.e. most of Killington's gladed terrain is relatively steep).

There are some good options, though. Check out Squeeze Play off of the Ramshead chair (it's a weird one, but it is a blue), and Treezy, although, in my opinion, they are just OK.

The cool ones you might like are to ski Vagabond (you get there from Snowdon, but can't get it from Ramshead) and jump in the woods as you see fit. To warm up, I'd recommend skiing the first pitch on Vagabond until the trail takes a hard right turn, and instead of taking that turn, go straight, into those woods. Super wide, mellow. After, if you like that, hit Patsy's/Tinman/Scarecrow from the top.

"This has been a great season! We have had 113.5"" of snowfall so far and while we had some warmer temps and melt off a couple weeks ago, the mountain has done a great job at making snow whenever possible. Have you checked out their conditions reports? http://www.killington.com/site/mountain/conditions/dor

While we're certainly not the west coast, Killington will have skiing into May and has tremendous snowmaking ability. The value of a M-F pass depends on how many days you use it, but if you have the time it can still be a great deal. You can also ski Pico, Killington's smaller sister mountain about 10 minutes away. I'm heading there today with my pas as they're closed Tue and Wed and will still have some of that 7"" of new powder that fell yesterday.

Killington also has a ton of parks - from beginner to advanced. You'll find what you need...

Outback for pizza.

Liquid art for breakfast sandwiches before you hit the hill.

""Wobbly,Pickle Barrel usally have a band or a dj playing most weekends.Check their sites ahead of time to see whats going on. The barrel provides a shuttle that can take you home if your reasonably close by. You may have to wait for it for a short while but way better than driving. If not keep killington taxi in your phone, they are great.
