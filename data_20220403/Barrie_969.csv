"Yea I‚Äôve heard that line a million times. Do you think maybe Canada should prioritize, idk‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs own damn citizens? And perhaps if it was even remotely affordable to start a family here, we‚Äôd have a higher birthrate?

Sure mass importing cheap labour is a quick and easy bandaid solution but it‚Äôs not a long term one and we‚Äôre already seeing the consequences of it with highly suppressed wages and skyrocketing housing costs (further suppressing our birthrate). Not to mention a large number that come here are now soon considering leaving anyway because of our ridiculous cost of living.

More than half of all international students are poor Indian kids coming here for the sole purpose of PR (not to study) and they pick the cheapest and easiest program they can to qualify them for a work permit at any minimum wage job to eventually achieve that.

"in my humble opinion, visible cameras are a deterrent to the low hanging fruit type criminals..  the ones that check doors at night to raid your cup holders.   to the more brazen, the camera's will mean very little and they'll just find ways to do their bidding around them.

I'm in the country but surrounded by new home construction and had a lot of trespassers and vandals (off-road vehicles and theft are common) and i have a mix of visible and not visible, and the number of trespassers and problem people have dropped to almost nil since adding the fake visible cameras (just unused crib cameras off kijiji), to supplement my more hidden ones.     The hidden ones didn't deter, but definitely helped identify culprits, the visible ones shooed them away",t2_eos0j71,DamonSeed,0,1648649531.0,0,t1_i2ptkk4,i2ptkk4,True,GivEmTheBroadStrokes,t3_ts06lb,https://www.reddit.com/r/barrie/comments/ts06lb/should_home_security_cameras_be_clearly_visible/,Should home security cameras be clearly visible on my new house in Barrie?,/r/barrie/comments/ts06lb/should_home_security_cameras_be_clearly_visible/i2ptkk4/,11,r/barrie,0,11

"You don‚Äôt need to hide them. But don‚Äôt get wifi cameras or things like Ring, Google, etc. Sure they‚Äôre good brands but they only record once they‚Äôre ‚Äútriggered‚Äù by an event - this means they miss events at times.

Get yourself a dedicated IP camera system that records 24/7 and deletes/overwrites old footage automatically after a week (or a month if you have sufficient storage)

But no. No need to hide them. If anything, they intimidate people.

"We haven't gone out of our way to hide ours as being visible is part of the deterrent. No one has said anything and I think, nowadays, it's becoming a lot more common to see them. I know at least 3 other friends who have them (two of whom use the same ones as me). 
  
In terms of cameras, I would recommend Eufy - [we have these ones](https://www.amazon.ca/Security-eufyCam-Wireless-Resolution-Compatibility/dp/B08C4TDK5N/ref=mp_s_a_1_16?crid=394RF4OLAV44F&keywords=eufy+security+camera&qid=1648623545&sprefix=Eufy+%2Caps%2C96&sr=8-16) . Unlike Ring, you don't have to pay a monthly fee and they store the notifications and recordings you take for, I think, up to approximately 3 months or so before overwriting them. We also got their wireless doorbell and were able to easily do the installation of everything ourselves. 

The quality has been great and we get almost instantaneous notifications - even in the midst of winter. The only downside is that the battery life isn't amazing.

\- Pay their employees less, with fewer benefits. I understand why, they cannot afford to pay more. Not only that, the chains often employ more people per customer served. Small business owners often have no employees at all, if they can get away with it, or as few as possible, working as few hours as they can get away with giving them. I've worked for both small local businesses and massive corporations. The latter treat me far better, with more pay and better job security. The people making the decisions in small businesses are paying you almost directly out of their own pockets, and resent every dime they have to dish out as a consequence. The layers of corporate abstraction between the employees and the shareholders in bigger companies means that this same phenomenon doesn't happen there.

\- Have less convenient hours, and more difficult locations to access, in the case of brick and mortar locations. I want to be able to make a single trip for all my shopping needs, not drive all over the world for them. Furthermore, there's the advantage of browsing to get ideas. I love wandering an Ikea store or similar, even if I have no plans to buy anything specific.

\- Charge their customers more, often (but not always) for inferior service/product.  This is the shortest item, but by far the most important. The economy of scale is quite powerful. Convenience and lower cost is progress, and always better, in my opinion.",t2_nlr24,RavingRationality,0,1648489369.0,0,t1_i2goppz,i2goppz,False,TheSwedishOprah,t3_tq8kk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/barrie/comments/tq8kk4/construction_next_to_park_place_starbucks/,Construction next to Park Place Starbucks?,/r/barrie/comments/tq8kk4/construction_next_to_park_place_starbucks/i2goppz/,3,r/barrie,0,3

"I've practiced several religions in my life and none of them really felt like a good fit for me, until I tried Paganism- specifically Norse Polytheism. I've been an Atheist, Buddhist, Christian, Rastafarian and a Satanist (LaVeyan and Theistic). But none of those really felt like what I needed in my life. Paganism just speaks to me.

I guess some benefits are that it makes me feel closer to my ancestors and has made me more appreciative of solstices and seasons changing. I find the stories of the Gods to be really interesting and meaningful to me, which makes worshipping them more engaging- especially if I include a reading from the Poetic/Prose Edda in my ceremony or offering to my chosen deities",t2_d79k5vp2,transzient,0,1648337024.0,0,t1_i291t69,i291t69,False,transzient,t3_tnz2by,https://www.reddit.com/r/barrie/comments/tnz2by/pagan_communities/,Pagan Communities,/r/barrie/comments/tnz2by/pagan_communities/i291t69/,4,r/barrie,0,4

If a person diets and exercises and controls there body weight they can easily live a healthier life and lower there chances of getting sick. So if a person chooses not to and is obese should they have to pay for any illness that may come with it? How is that any different from someone who chooses not be vaccinated? They both had options to avoid getting sick and they chose not to. I‚Äôm not an anti vaxer or anything I am tripled vaxxed but come on Karen this is over life cannot continue like this.

Like others have said, leaving the cage outside with food and favourite toys is a good idea. You can also leave food and water dishes in other areas outside so the bird comes down to eat. Also can you play any music or sounds (phone rings, whistles, etc) that are familiar to your bird? It's probably not far from your house. Might be hiding and quiet since that is their instinct when in danger. I read somewhere that most of them are within 500 metres of the house.

"I believe that annual parking of $700 is for places like the Collier Street lot that aren't covered with our resident passes anyway. Great for people who work down there and need to be parking and paying for it anyway.

To me, the article is poorly worded. If you use the hotspot app, which is similar to the Green P or the Mackay Pay app that are used in Toronto and in conservation areas (Tiffin uses Mackay Pay), charges a ""convenience fee"" each time you use it to pay for your parking.

So you go downtown, park on the street during a week day, your resident pass wouldn't cover that so instead of hunting for change you put the spot number into the app, the car your driving and the time you'll be there and you can pay with your credit card.

The $20 annually they refer to is in lieu of the $0.20 per use convenience fee that is charged in the app. If you park downtown less than 100 times a year then the $0.20 per use fee is a better value, over 100 times then the annual / monthly fee is a better option.
