"Both the red light cameras on that corner and the ones on Bond / Elk Grove Florin have been messed up like that for a couple of weeks now. I watched the one you are talking about snapping pictures numerous times while not a single driver was moving. And several times now I've been stuck at Bond / Elk Grove Florin due to the train and saw that one just going crazy snapping pictures, again with nobody moving. There is something wrong with both of them. As mentioned they are all reviewed and there is even video taken. Typically if you get a ticket from them you will get a link with photos and the video showing you run the light. A lot of the time it's usually people not completely stopping when they go to turn, thinking they can just slowly roll through.",t2_98ydq,snaxx89,0,1649000119.0,0,t1_i38ezi0,i38ezi0,True,Sdotadot1,t3_tuzt7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElkGrove/comments/tuzt7l/does_any_one_notice_that_some_of_the_street/,Does any one notice that some of the street lights start taking pictures for no reason?,/r/ElkGrove/comments/tuzt7l/does_any_one_notice_that_some_of_the_street/i38ezi0/,1,r/ElkGrove,0,1

"Not even close to it. Elk Grove really needs more multi-unit housing, condos, townhomes and could even use some mixed use buildings.  You can keep people ""local"" even in the suburbs. 

Elk Grove can throttle building, keeping the prices higher than other areas, who are filling in with more affordable housing. Elk Grove cares about Elk Grove, not affordable housing in Sacramento overall. As long as Elk Grove creates attractiveness and convenience, it'll stay a strong housing market for a seller.  Rocklin/Roseville/Loomis is building like crazy for housing and commercial. They're creating their very own Metro area without any need to drive to Sac.

I see Elk Grove doing the same thing. 

&#x200B;

Right now, Natomas is building a lot of single family and multi-unit homes.  Condos that were $300k 18 months ago are now $400k+ because of demand.  As long as there is a great demand, it'll be a seller's market.  With a new Kaiser, Training hospital, Costco and mega warehouses, the housing demand in the Natomas area is going to stay strong.  Roseville/Rocklin/Loomis area is also growing and extremely competitive. And those areas are a drive and half from any job in downtown Sac.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, downtown, midtown may see prices stabilize when there is more housing. Maybe.

&#x200B;

Do I get to dismiss your sources because you may like NPR or Mother Jones or Huffington Post or something?

Pat has been in local politics for a long time and, all-in-all, has done a decent job as much as I don't like how maybe those with connections get more attention than others, that's just politics especially at the local level. I've lived in Elk Grove for a decade and the city, even with how massive it has grown, is running pretty smoothly compared to the surrounding suburbs of Sacramento and Sacramento itself which is a leftist cesspool.

"I am considering moving to District 2,  which Pat Hume is the council member for, so I decided to look into what this guy is about. There is really not much information about local politicians so I went through his social media pages. Few things I picked up:

1. He really does not like the homeless situation and that seems to be his focus. Like 99% of his posts are about it. Which is fine, no one is happy about the homeless situation
2. He shared a post about the father who shot his kids in a Sacramento church, something about him over staying his Visa. This gives off anti-immigrant vibes. American born citizens commit horrible crimes everyday, why are we concerned about monster's Visa status? He's a monster, end of story.
3. Saw couple of things he shared which came from right-wing news sources - never a good sign when a guy can't discern between facts and right-wing media.
4. He's towing that whole ""both sides are the same"" line with stuff like ""I am running is to break the cycle of polarization and bitterness in our political discourse"" -- yea sure, ""polarization and bitterness""... Republicans stormed the Capitol and tried to overturn an election, but sure, let's call that ""polarization"". You want to stop political polarization? Here's an idea, stop sharing ring-wing media stuff.... see #3.

&#x200B;

All in all, I didn't find his stuff too offensive. I was kind of expecting something worse, but he seems pretty focused. I think the other comments on here are a bit harsh.

I guess my opinion on him is neutral at this point.

"**[Tule elk](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tule_elk)** 
 
 >The tule elk (Cervus canadensis nannodes) is a subspecies of elk found only in California, ranging from the grasslands and marshlands of the Central Valley to the grassy hills on the coast. The subspecies name derives from the tule (), a species of sedge native to freshwater marshes on which the Tule elk feeds. When the Europeans first arrived, an estimated 500,000 tule elk roamed these regions, but by 1870 they were thought to be extirpated. However, in 1874‚Äì1875 a single breeding pair was discovered in the tule marshes of Buena Vista Lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley.

"No, there really isn't any that I know of. This is one of the frustration that leads me to write my comment. Essentially the only time you hear about Elk Grove politics and see the politicians is when they attend ribbon cutting on some new development.

I follow all the Elk Grove social media accounts on my FB, Nextdoor, etc... and I am still woefully uninformed. I attended a city council meeting once but I didn't really know what was going on. All I remember was that a developer was arguing that we need to decrease the size of the park so they can have more development space.

That's one of the drawbacks of living in a suburbs, no one really covers the political news here.

"I'll jump in here and basically echo everyone else, Elk Grove is probably your best bet.

To paint a picture here, I'm a white Jew, my husband is Filipino, and we're gay. So living in a place that was not just racially diverse but also just generally accepting of everyone was a huge thing for us.

Sacramento is quite diverse in general, but as you move into the city itself you notice that it can also be very segmented, with certain areas much higher in one and lower in another. Once you move into the ""nicer"" cities like Roseville and Folsom, you find that diversity very quickly falls off. It's one of the reasons Roseville/Folsom and beyond are on our ""not interested"" list. 

Elk Grove on the other hand is, in my opinion, much better. We live over on the east side and our neighbors/neighborhood is one of the most diverse I've ever lived in. My husband and I are technically ""upper middle class"" by income, but our neighborhood is just normal folks, everything from lawyers, a CEO, and a university professor to primary school teachers, laborers, and small family business owners. 

All around I'd say Elk Grove is your best option. Its generally clean, safe, solid schools, diverse and open, and has everything you need. The city proper is 15 minutes away for all your big city needs, and the city itself is busy revitalizing itself into being a destination spot too (casino, possible zoo, and an large ongoing public venue project).

"About Natomas for OP (and anyone else who doesn‚Äôt know), there was a building moratorium in place in 2008 that wasn‚Äôt lifted until 2015.

">My main worry is that our elected leaders are pretty corrupt (both Democrats and Republicans).  They are basically owned by and paid for by real estate developers.

I feel like the elected officials are way less progressive than the citizens of this city. Today I got a flyer from ""Pat Hume"" and I just didn't see anything on it that interest me. Elk Grove needs a progressive city leader who wants the city to invest in more environmentally friendly stuff, curtail sprawl, decrease big box stores in favor of mom and pop, etc...

"Pros: 

CA weather vs MO

CA people vs MO

CA wine and beer selection is unrivaled
 
CA diversity
 
Elk Grove Public Education is top ranked year after year

NorCal food culture from restaurants to farmers markets

Quick access to NorCal favorites - SF, Napa, Tahoe

CA income with lower CA home prices

No snow and rarely under 30

No tornado warnings

Limited humidity 

Both my kids 3rd and 6th have a great range of friends from all cultures.

Its a huge melting pot, not just black and white

Crime rate is very low here. EG is one of the lowest per capita crime rates in the country. 

Best in the world job opportunities within 60 miles radius of EG. 

Vibrate economy

SMUD - look it up. AMAZINGLY lower energy costs


Cons:

Several 100+ degree days

Smoke days - CA over the last 5 years has 2 to 6 weeks of bad smoke air days from local fires (not in EG). Before 2017, this was rare. 

Lifer CAs who think they have it terrible, but yet refuse to leave. They love telling everyone, including random people at the grocery store or on Reddit, how much they hate it here. 

Higher income taxes - CA has a surplus tax revenue vs deficit in most states, but it sucks to pay 32% fed plus 9% state on the income above 320k. It does NOT suck to make over 320k though‚Ä¶ so is that a EG pro or con? You decide. 

Higher gas prices

People who complain about the high gas prices‚Ä¶ constantly. 

EG shuts down after 9 pm every night

Only Kings NBA for pro sports within 70 miles. 

Telling non CA people, I live south of Sacramento 

Home prices affordability has become an issue in the last 3 years.

"There's not a lot I can add as a newbie myself so I'll just speak to our experience.

My family has been in Elk Grove for about 2 years and in CA for 4. We are black and moved from Alaska. The city we lived in was very diverse. So the first city we lived in was kind of a shock because there were barely any black people. It was okay but not great.

When we moved to Elk Grove I immediately felt comfortable because it was more close to what it was like back home. Heat has been rough for us but we make do.

"I assume you are ok with higher real estate prices ($600-700k real estate). My recommendation (and I have more knowledge in this area since I live here) is in the 95624/95829 (Sac city proper but still EG school district). Areas that gets you in Arnold Adreani or Edna Batey Elementary Schools feed into Albiani and Pleasant Grove HS. All top schools. I think the PGHS demographic is about 5-7% blacks, higher Hispanics, and Asians. Found this link below. 

As an over-represented minority, my kids haven‚Äôt had a lot of issues. However, both of my kids have been friends with black kids since they were in preschool. Best friends. However, they each have 1-2 black friends and that just seems like a typical sampling in this area. It‚Äôs not like where I grew up in WA where I felt I had more expansive and quite frankly, more friends who are black. You definitely won‚Äôt be in a predominantly white population here vs St Louis. My oldest is in college and on the East Coast and finally leaving his ‚ÄúUnited Nations‚Äù bubble where he grew up. Candidly, there is still incidences of racism here. My kids‚Äô friends and my girl friends (their momma friends that‚Äôs part of my village) have shared personal stories with me. As my kids grew up, I saw that many moms of all races volunteer here and there in grade school and that‚Äôs made a big difference where kids have a solid group of friends that support them.  

The high school my kids go to have a black student union. EG isn‚Äôt perfect (maybe worst if you go east of Excelsior/Grant Line) and I think we are always going to have 10-33% of the population who have prejudices like anywhere but I feel safer in EG as a minority than I would in the Midwest where I‚Äôve traveled frequently for work. 

Air quality in CA sucks the last few years due to the fires but it‚Äôs affected the entire West Coast. Allergies are bad here sometimes. I don‚Äôt suffer them but my family doesn‚Äôt so Claritin is their friend.

"In the greater Sacramento area?  Not really, if I'm being honest.  But then I'm biased; this is where I chose (but I'm white, so keep that in mind).  The schools are solid, we have good stores I like, and things aren't nearly as spread out as Roseville is.  It's still an auto suburb with all that entails, but we have great parks and plenty of kid friendly activities.

As for neighborhoods in general:

Roseville, Granite Bay, and Folsom are bougie new money upper middle class and kinda red.  Think Orange County North.  Land Park and Curtis Park are more old money liberal, but very expensive.  Fair Oaks and Citrus Heights are working class white and a lot of former Soviet folks - a bit Trumpy for my tastes.  Natomas is really diverse, but it's also got the potential to be underwater if the wrong levy breaks.  The whole region does, but that neighborhood is a particularly deep bowl.  You might have to carry flood insurance to get a mortgage there.  Pocket is nice, but might be a bit pale for your stated preferences.  Not sure the demographics in the region.

Midtown is, IMO, for the 20 something set who like to party.  Much more walkable, but it's urban life and the prices and conditions match that reality.  Might suck with kids.  Other neighborhoods I know less about.  

Just know that Oak Park, Meadowview, and a lot of South Sac are kinda rough.  Drive through it, preferably during the day, and you'll get the gist.  It's not like you're gonna get gunned down in the street for just existing, but there's a lot of homes that haven't seen work recently (like, since the 90s or even the 70s/80s).

"Summers are dry heat.  No humidity.  Avg 90 - 100 . But it can get in the 100+.  I've been in humid Georgia in the middle of summer.  Humidity is way worse than dry heat.  You should be able to enjoy your backyard.  Winters are mild compared to South and East.  People here complain it's cold when it gets in the 40s.  Avg winters is 40s-50s.  The air quality kind of sucks in the summer, mainly due to all the wildfires throughout the state. Pretty bad if you have pollen allergies too.  But Elk Grove doesn't necessarily have to worry about actual wildfires itself.  

Racism, based on my anecdotal experience, is mild.  I'm not white, and in the 25 years I've been here, I have never had an explicit incident of racism, knock on wood.  But, there are red neck elements, just like every other place.  I can only speak about the Laguna West area where I live, but it is a very diverse, very tolerant, very peaceful area.   I hate cops in general, but I have to say that our Police Dept is actually pretty professional and pretty tolerant.  I haven't had or heard of any profiling type incidents by them.

My main worry is that our elected leaders are pretty corrupt (both Democrats and Republicans).  They are basically owned by and paid for by real estate developers.  Thus far, Elk Grove has grown to be a pretty good city.  But the more corrupt our leaders are, I worry about the future this City is headed in.

* Large school district
* Nice regional park
* Maybe a zoo in the future
* Access to two major freeways

* Typical suburban shopping with major chains
* Developing a faster route to Folsom Area

CON:

* Bad traffic
* Nowhere close to a traditional mall (Arden Fair Mall is closest)

"Elk Grove borders a rural area.  South of Grant Line it can get kinda red neck.  There's been Proud Boy stickers on a local gas pump, anti-Biden stuff and a few other things.  It's not as bad as Roseville (which is your upper middle class Karen factory).  A couple young black men in a local church had racial slurs yelled at them while walking near that aforementioned gas station.

That said, a lot of Elk Grove proper is middle class White and Asian families - likely bay area folk escaping the real estate situation.

So it's a mix.  According to this, [we're almost 11% black, but 24% Asian](https://datausa.io/profile/geo/elk-grove-ca/#demographics).

"If you're looking for full out office space, you'll want to look at commercial real estate management companies. Not all list on loopnet, and most don't list on craigslist. PDF is one - but it sucks to look them up because obviously the name...  Jackson is one of the bigger ones, and they tend to list their stuff on loop net, but they'll have spaces on their website that aren't listed. CRE, Buzz Oates, and Newman Knight Frank manage a lot of properties here too...  


I do agree though about a lack of solid co-working spaces. I had reached out to InnoGrove a while back about an office, but got told they were full. I'd been wanting to create one myself that focused on creative fields like photography and videography, but haven't had the time or money to get one off the ground.  Currently, I rent a space upstairs at my church, Elk Grove United Church of Christ, in their fellowship hall. They had a couple open rooms that they had talked about renting out, so I grabbed one.

Emily and Ryan are amazing and they have some spaces in their store for co-working too... so if you're looking for more of a co-working type option, I'd reach out to them for sure!",t2_e95t6,Bmorgan1983,0,1647462225.0,0,t1_i0xgu51,i0xgu51,True,vinhboy,t3_tfnnyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElkGrove/comments/tfnnyz/where_to_find_office_space_in_elk_grove/,Where to find office space in Elk Grove?,/r/ElkGrove/comments/tfnnyz/where_to_find_office_space_in_elk_grove/i0xgu51/,5,r/ElkGrove,0,5

"There used to be multiple bookstores with multiple locations. Barnes & Nobles, Tower Books, Borders, Crown and Walden were the big players. Not counting the book section in grocery stores, pharmacies and record stores. 

New competition killed off Tower Books. Barnes and Noble moved into Birdcage in Fall of 1997 and hurt Tower Books a great deal. Barnes and Noble's slick website also hurt them.

Then Amazon was born.

So, you'll excuse me if I doubt the government really is doing anything other than try to generate revenue (which they then give to illegal immigrants - California has spent $4 billion on healthcare for illegal immigrants while ignoring citizens).",t2_bsw8slwl,StanTheMan8000,0,1647113273.0,0,t1_i0ekecn,i0ekecn,False,LittleCarp87,t3_tcex08,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElkGrove/comments/tcex08/which_partarea_in_elk_grove_is_the_most_peaceful/,Which part/area in Elk Grove is the most peaceful that you know?,/r/ElkGrove/comments/tcex08/which_partarea_in_elk_grove_is_the_most_peaceful/i0ekecn/,7,r/ElkGrove,0,7

Agreed.  Ultimately, just about *every* shopping center / strip mall / etc. in Elk Grove needs to go in that direction.

The solution to *that* - motivating people to develop denser housing instead of hold onto land as an investment - is to eliminate the concept of land as an investment.  A land value tax - especially as a replacement for property and sales taxes (and income/payroll taxes on a state/federal level) - would immediately make land speculation nonviable; combine that with UBI and an abolition (or at least a substantial relaxation) of arbitrary zoning restrictions, and unaffordable housing costs would be a thing of the past.",t2_ayqdf,northrupthebandgeek,0,1647045803.0,0,t1_i0b9ev8,i0b9ev8,False,vinhboy,t3_tbzrpr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElkGrove/comments/tbzrpr/the_state_of_elk_grove_real_estate_this_is_what/,The state of Elk Grove real estate.

"Second Dr. Oshetski. A while back my dentist was pushing me for Invisalign for my TMJ issues and I went to Dr Oshetski office for a second opinion. They really took care of me, called me twice over a period of time to examine my teeth and how they were crowding, and quite honestly gave me his opinion that there was no proof Invisalign would help my TMJ. So to be honest, I‚Äôve not actually gotten Invisalign through him, but his honesty, personality, staff, and office impressed me SO much that if I had money just to get Invisalign for cosmetic reasons I‚Äôd get it with Dr Oshetski without a second thought.

Editing to add that the two exams I had with Dr Oshetski were free consultations so I didn‚Äôt even have to pay anything, and even though it was free the care was very high quality.

I am very happy with them. Same guy has been doing our neighborhood for 10+ years.

if you're suggesting ""paranoia"", then...

"> behind you *paid* the tab'

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

"An arrest was made:

ELK GROVE, CA ‚Äì On February 20, 2020, at 6:47 p.m., the Elk Grove Police Department responded to the 8100 block of Sheldon Road regarding a man down near the bus stop. Officers arrived on scene and found a man down on the ground suffering from multiple stab wounds. Unfortunately, despite life-saving efforts, the man succumbed to his injuries.    
   
As officers started their investigation and began to canvas the area for a possible suspect, potential witnesses, and evidence, they found surveillance footage of the suspect, later identified as 31-year-old Aaron Spencer, approaching the victim, who was lying down near the bus stop. Spencer then became agitated and stabbed the victim several times in the upper body. The suspect walked away from the scene before officers arrived in the area.  
   
Spencer later returned to the scene and was detained by officers. Through investigative efforts, detectives determined that Aaron Spencer was responsible for stabbing and killing the victim. However, the weapon used in the homicide has not been recovered.   
   
Spencer was transported to the Sacramento County Main Jail and booked on a charge of Penal Code 187 (Murder).  
   
The name of the victim has not been released, and identification will be made by the Sacramento County Coroner‚Äôs Office.",t2_96pan11k,Imadum_Bass,0,1645481091.0,0,t1_hxvxie0,hxvxie0,True,Imadum_Bass,t3_sxw9su,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElkGrove/comments/sxw9su/fatal_stabbing_near_winco/,Fatal Stabbing near Winco,/r/ElkGrove/comments/sxw9su/fatal_stabbing_near_winco/hxvxie0/,7,r/ElkGrove,0,7
