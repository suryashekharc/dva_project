"Trail Ridge is currently open up to Many Parks Curve, which is a nice drive and good views, but it's not open over the top till (usually) late May. Going up to Bear Lake is also worth doing even just for the drive.

The closure on Hwy 7 is between Lyons and Raymond (Allenspark). Hwy 7 from Estes Park and 72 down to Idaho Springs / Black Hawk / Golden is open. It is a nice drive, but not the same as Trail Ridge.

If the weather is good, hiking just about anywhere in the park is worth doing. Trails around Bear Lake are quite popular (and for good reason - the scenery is stunning). If the weather hits and you want to stay closer to the car - the loops around Sprague Lake and Bear Lake are good (assuming the road conditions let you get there). Other nice hikes include Dear Mt or Cub Lake or the Fern Lake trail up to The Pool.",t2_3flej,srednal,0,1648566591.0,0,t1_i2kmqu0,i2kmqu0,False,865_Ridger,t3_tqcgyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstesPark/comments/tqcgyi/visiting_in_early_april/,visiting in early april,/r/EstesPark/comments/tqcgyi/visiting_in_early_april/i2kmqu0/,2,r/EstesPark,0,2

"Frankly there’s nothing comparable in the country. It’s the highest continuously paved road in the continental US and travels through something like 5 different ecological zones.
A nice drive is the scenic byway between Golden and Estes taking state highway 7, but last I heard there was construction at some point along that route and part of it is detoured.

You can still get part of the way up trail ridge, just not all the way up and over and the old one way trail up the back is closed to cars till summer.

"It’s unlikely to be in the 20s during the day, that’s more like a night time low. 

What you are looking at is possibly snow; wet, heavy snow that dumps several inches and melts the following day is the mountain version of spring rain showers. Wind is going to make the temperature feel lower than it actually is. It tends to be bursts of wind in the spring, rather than sustained wind like in our fall and winter.
As for the weather, it truly is variable. It could call for heavy snow but be sunny, It could call for clear skies and be overcast, it could do exactly what the weathermen said. While it’s a good idea to know what’s possible, it’s almost impossible to pin down spring weather for any given day. Prepare for this with layers, as you said. 

There is no shortage of good restaurants in town. Some highlights are Antonio’s pizza, The Rock Inn and Mama Rosa’s.

Trails, it really depends on what you’re looking for. I would say to you, as variable as the weather can be in the spring, stick to trails you can get off of within an hour if something crazy happens. Spring and fall unexpected weather results in the majority of mountain rescues for unprepared hikers.

 When you look at trails online be sure to find ones on the east side of the park, as the west side (over Trail Ridge Road) is inaccessible without an hours long detour by I-70.",t2_v8qogpf,Flammablefrosting,0,1648499834.0,0,t1_i2hdzvc,i2hdzvc,True,865_Ridger,t3_tqcgyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstesPark/comments/tqcgyi/visiting_in_early_april/,visiting in early april,/r/EstesPark/comments/tqcgyi/visiting_in_early_april/i2hdzvc/,3,r/EstesPark,0,3

"The weather here is always unpredictable, early spring being the most unpredictable. I've started hikes in a tee-shirt and finished by brushing 4 inches of snow of my car when I got back to the trailhead. Always best to be prepared for anything here. I usually just use my weather rock to tell the current conditions.

A fist sized rock is suspended on a rope and conditions are interpreted as follows:

Rock is dry and warm……Sunny   
Rock is moving…………..…Windy   
Rock is wet……………….....Raining   
Rock is white………………..Snowing   
Rock is not visible……..….Foggy   
Rock is gone……………...…Tornado – Run

The biggest thing is to be aware of the Rocky Mountain National Park entry reservation system.   It was introduced during Covid and I have to assume it will still be in place this summer.  So unless you are willing to enter the park before 6am you will need to book time slots whenever they open them up for the season.

"Less than a month of planning - you are bold! Estes is up in the mountains so if you are altitude sensitive, 3 days may not be enough to acclimate. And that’s just something to consider at any point in the year. Could it blizzard? Eh, maybe. Eh, maybe. It’ll still be winter so your best chances for success will be geared toward winter activities. When people think about winter activities, often skiing is at the top of the list, but Estes is not an Alpine ski town so you actually are thinking along the right track if the weather permits, UTVs rentals, snowmobile rental if there’s enough snow. If you can find Inner tubing hills or sledding in general, that might be the best bang for buck for the kids. The Y is pretty neat, have only visited,haven’t stayed there personally.

Olympus Lodge, Coyote Lodge and Discovery Lodge offer weekly rentals. The issue with weekly rentals is that the lodging in Estes is often booked solid months in advance. It’s a gamble to go that way.

"Please don't feed critters you see running around. I know they're cute and it's tempting, but you're only causing them harm in the long term. Feeding wildlife in RMNP is a crime. 

There's a significant chance that being fed by humans contributed to the deaths of those chipmunks. 

I'm not sure who told you the chipmunks might have died because they hadn't been fed, as the opposite is likely true. 

The following is from the nps.gov website:

Animals can easily pick up scavenging practices, so never feed them. Animals stay healthier when you do not feed them. And, once they learn to beg, they can become aggressive, more likely to get injured by vehicles, and become seriously ill. They do not need your food handouts to survive. You can help us curtail this unwanted behavior from animals by putting your food away and moving away from the animal.

If you make it into town, then walking the town can be nice, shopping, restaurants, and some nice bars / breweries. We like going to The Barrel.

You can rent snowshoes, and maybe try that at one of the lower elevation / popular trails? Also, you have no experience hiking or driving in the snow, but you are still thinking of driving into the Rocky Mountains during our snowiest month, with the intention of hiking? I can’t think that it will end well. In fact, I’ve never seen the trails safe or clear by mid March.

"I'm not here to change your mind. The bottom line is a modern 2 stroke engine designed for bikes (not the cheap chinese ones) burns it's fuel more efficiently than say a leaf blower would. Not only that but it uses 1/8th the fuel that a car could, meaning I woupd only be contributing to 1/8th of the carbon footprint and physical impact of offshore drilling, freighting and trucking that fuel to me.

Beyond that I would not support the lithium ion batteries in modern e bikes as we do not have any real recycling options for those batteries. Sadly many of our electronics end up in landfills in other countries, with workers and sometimes children picking through them. I don't want to contribute to that, one day we as a country will have better solutions for e-waste, but currently our options are poor.


Not only that but an Ebike motor doesnt last as long as an electric car would, but still has a fairly large carboon footpring during manufacturing and unlike an electric car the bikes do not last lpng enough to make a net gain on their carbon offset.

I'm a big person, a 750 watt ebike motor will die on me inevitably meaning I must buy another meaning another must be manufactured, but a 2 stroke engine with proper maintenance and care will last and burn more cleanly than a typical chainsaw engine that many people associate with 2 strokes.",t2_1n7c80qa,Riotthedev,0,1642996620.0,0,t1_htz5qmj,htz5qmj,False,[deleted],t3_sbbnml,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstesPark/comments/sbbnml/looking_for_a_bike/,Looking for a Bike,/r/EstesPark/comments/sbbnml/looking_for_a_bike/htz5qmj/,0,r/EstesPark,0,0

"Ebikes lose up to half their value on the first ride, our methods for disposing lithium ion batteries literally just leads them to landfills in other countries alongside our other poorly ""recycled"" electronics, and a 2 stroke engine gets 80 miles to the gallon compared to 10-15 to the gallon on most trucks and suvs.

Do they offput exhaust? Yes, are they any worse than a car? The sheer efficiency of the gas useage makes their carbon footprint laughably small in comparison to a honda civic

"My SO and I are frequent visitors to Estes Park (and currently looking for a house there, which is a whole other story given how hot the market is). Here are a few things we like to do: 

1. First and foremost are the mountains. Anything in the park is great. You gotta drive Trail Ridge Road all the way to Granby and back. It's bananas. Hike anywhere and everywhere you can. Spend an hour in the park or spend a whole day there. It's totally worth it. A hike up Deer Mountain is very doable and offers great views. Get to Bear Lake -- you won't be disappointed. 
2. Avant Garde Aleworks is our go to place for a beer. Open mic night is fun.  
3. A little more upscale is the whiskey bar in the Stanley hotel. A nice spot for a sip.
4. The best restaurant in town (IMHO) is Bird and Jim. Surprisingly good food. Get a reservation as soon as you can. 
5. The American Legion is a cool spot to hang out with the locals (and they are very welcoming). Sign up for trivia night or just have one of their amazing burgers (huge!)
6. Smokin' Dave's BBQ is also pretty good, (and we're from central Texas). 
7. La Cocina de Mama is good for a margarita and pretty good Mexican food.
8. No dispensaries in EP, so load up at the Bud Depot in Lyons.

"4x4 is good, but keep in mind your not likely to be driving around all the time in 4x4 mode, especially at higher speeds. I have snow tires on my truck and only ever use 4x4 to get out from being stuck in heavy snow.

It's a good idea to have chains just in case. Additionally, it is a very good idea to put extra weight in your truck bed to help prevent fishtailing. I certainly appreciate people who can control their vehicles when it snows. 

To give you just one example of what I have seen around here... I once watched a large 4x4 truck (Texas plate) slowly pull out of the Safeway parking lot, and it immediately spun out, slid, and rotated across highway 34 in a horrifying spectacle. They were super lucky they weren't hit by another vehicle. It had snowed about 8 inches and the roads weren't totally plowed yet.

"I would absolutely get AWD I would recommend renting a vehicle that is good in the snow and preferably has good snow tires on it. It's very common to get snow in Estes Park and Aspen in October. Be prepared for varying weather conditions which can change at a moments notice as this is common for those areas and in the mountains in general. If you leave for the day and it's 60 have layers in a backpack in preparation for snow, rain etc.  While a corvette would be fun it is definitely not a practical choice not only for these conditions but for some of the roads you will be traveling on. I would suggest a mid-sized vehicle such as a crossover. Something that is a little big larger and lifted from the ground which will handle better on some dirt roads etc.

This is going to be a beautiful trip and I gold such a special place for Rocky Mountain National Park in my heart (as that's where I got married). I always tell people this is such a beautiful place to go. So with all the above said I think this is such a fun and amazing trip to go on. I just like to caution people who have not been there before or are not from this area that it's also mother nature and to be respectful and responsible while visiting.

I would definitely recommend doing some research on the area as well as even visiting the website for Rocky Mountain National Park and the town of Aspen. There's a lot of valuable information not only on what to do there but also what to expect weather wise etc.

Keep in mind as well for Rocky Mountain National Park specifically they have been requiring timed entry passes I believe this is a new thing since COVID although I'm not sure. So when you do go just plan on having that prepared. The timed entry is $2 and the pass for the day is $25. Definitely research areas of the park before going. I've gone many times and still have yet to see everything I want to see there because it is so large!

"1. Trail. Ridge .Road. - you must drive through until the Alpine Visitor’s center. Unreal. We took it all the way through and came down the west side of RMNP, down all the way and went to Red Rocks. What a drive. Obviously more of a 1/2 day to full day. I wanna go back and go through to Vail.
2. We went 4-wheeling in the mts. Amazing! Best unexpected part of the trip.
3. Bear Lake - can drive to it or walk same trail that takes you to Victoria Falls
EDIT: 3. Stanley Hotel - Stephen King stayed there for one night and wrote the Shining after.
4. Walk around town on Saturday. Usually a little fair and just soak it in. There’s a gondola ride near town that looked great.
5. Boulder looked like a fun town to grab dinner or drinks in on the way up from the airport.

At the altitude, snow is likely. It was cold at night when we went the last week in August. 

We stayed at a little cabin near the entrance to RMBP. Just amazing.

Be prepared for a hunt. Housing up here is hard to come by in reasonable price ranges.

"There are playgrounds all over town.

Stanley park near the school campus is the biggest one: picnic area, little playground, big playground, picnic shelters, plenty of open space to run, play ball, fly a kite. There’s  one downtown by the post office, one downtown by the Dairy Queen, one by the marina at Lake Estes, one in a residential area on the south end of town.

You didn’t ask, but I have a method for hiking with kids: a good rule of thumb for how much they can handle is half their age in miles or less. Fortunately there are a couple places that meet this for three year olds!
Bear Lake and Sprague Lake are both in the National Park, and Lilly Lake is south of town. All three are fabulous “loop” nature walks of about a half mile each and are great hikes for littles. Of course, you can always pick a “hike in-hike out” trail and just go for a half hour or so and come back.


My personal parenting style involves bribery:
There is a line of embroidered patches that have the trails on them, and they’re cheap. A really cool thing you can do is get each kid a patch for each trail and put the patch on something of theirs, a jacket, hat, bag, etc. It’s a tangible reminder of their vacation and it’s fun to show off and collect.

The National Park also has a junior ranger program, and there’s different levels of difficulty. You pick up a little pamphlet at a visitor center, and when it’s complete, you turn it in and the kids get a cool park ranger badge. It’s a fun way to keep them engaged in the outdoors and it’s secretly educational! 
I don’t know if it’s accessible with covid restrictions, but the bottom level of the Fall River visitor center has a really cool kids section with dress up clothes for pioneers, and a 3D map of the park. It’s cool to see the mountains from above.

Brand new this year is a mountain coaster, and I believe the kiddos can ride with you. You get a hand brake and can control how fast you go down. Check is out, it’s called the mustang mountain coaster.

I believe our farmers market is starting up soon, that’s fun to take kids to. Sometimes there’s a person who makes balloon animals for tips. There’s a Bakery that sells soft giant pretzels, always a hit with my kids.


You didn’t ask, but I’m going to throw out a couple cheap and family friendly restaurants.

The Bighorn is fabulous, cheap, classic small town diner. 

Antonios pizza is absolutely the best pizza in town, with the Sandwich Mafia coming in a close second. (Sandwich Mafia is cheaper and delivers).

Don’t forget to dress in layers, wear sunscreen, and drink lots of water.

"You have a lot of questions and I’ll try to get them all. Please note this is all personal opinion stuff.

Hotel.

The Stanley is expensive for what it is and not maintained very well. It’s worth going on a tour but it’s not worth staying there. For a place to stay for a honeymoon look at Della Terra Mountain Chateau. My husband and I have gone there on anniversary’s and it’s amazing (and child free= quiet)

Weather. 

The bottom line is that weather in the mountains is extremely variable. That said, January and February, while cold, are not usually very snowy. Snow comes primarily in “spring” March through May.

100% you need a car. This area is not designed with pedestrians in mind. Even if it was, everything is uphill at least one way, and the altitude can be difficult for people from low elevations.  It will be “off season” and the shuttle through town will not be running. You want a car.

The drive from Denver isn’t bad. Roads are cleared well when it does snow, and like I said, snow isn’t usually too bad January and February. I would suggest to time it in such a way that you arrive in Estes park before sundown (4pm ish in winter) because I personally do not like driving the canyon in the dark.

Parking should not be an issue for that time range you’re looking at.

What’s open?

Currently just about everything. The Colorado mask mandate has been changed from “everyone all the time” to “optional outside or indoors for the fully vaccinated.” Businesses may require masks. Even in winter most things will be open, although it is likely they will have shorter operation hours: 10-4, closed Monday, etc. 

Things to do outside.

There are a couple recommendations for that, depending on what you’re into. Kirks Flyshop does guided fly fishing trips. Something wildwood something does guided hiking and camping trips. Sombrero ranch does horse trails. And “The Mountain Shop” can outfit you with rentals for cross country skiing or snowshoeing in the park and will be able to get you the gear and information to make it a pleasant experience no matter what your skill/comfort level is.

Other stuff you didn’t ask, but I want to throw out there.
Romantic restaurants:

Twin Owl Steak House

The Rock Inn

Cute home town diners:

The Bighorn

“You Need Pie”

There’s several micro breweries and wineries near by that could be fun, if you’re in to that.

Be careful looking at downhill skiing, there isn’t any in Estes Park and the closest ones are still 4ish hour drive away one way.
Trail Ridge Road will be closed at that time of year. The park is still worth going to though, even though the west part will be inaccessible.
There are festivals going on fairly often, even in winter, check out the “Town of Estes Park” website. (It’s Visit Estes Park dot com)

Thank you for researching before you go!

"I don’t know if it has electricity, but Olive Ridge campground is just outside of Allenspark and has really close by access to the Wild Basin entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. It is also nearby Lilly Lake, technically part of the park, but I don’t think (I could be wrong) that’s included in the reservation system. It’s maybe a 1/2 mile loop, so great for little kids. Also Olive ridge is part of National Forest land, which has trails. I believe (I could be wrong) that there is a new rule in which you’re supposed to have at least one person in your party with a current Colorado fishing/hunting license when you use national forest land. 

If you can get into it (it’s usually booked pretty far out) Aspenglen is a campground at the North entrance to the park. It’s a walkable distance to horse stables, an abandoned cabin, Fall River, and a general store/gift shop/restaurant.

"First things first, make sure you have a park reservation. There are two kinds of passes, Just Bear Lake, and the whole park. If you don't have one, you'll have to try to get in the park before it officially opens which I believe is 5 AM for Bear Lake. This pass is above and beyond your ATB pass or day/week pass for the park you will buy at the gate.

For hikes, Gem Lake, Bierstadt Lake, Alberta Falls  if you can get to the Bear Lake Parking lot before it fills up, and Sprague Lake if you need a much smaller hike.

 2nd on Putt putt, right outside the park. I would also recommend checking out the activities around Lake Estes. If you have an active family there are rentals for boats and these odd 4 person bikes that people seem to have a love hate relationship with. If you've never been, The Stanley is a fun place to check out.

"Seconded on the Gem Lake idea. I was at Bear Lake yesterday and there's easily a foot of snow in all the paths running near and up to the lake. The lake itself is still frozen. A lot could happen between now at the 29th, but it very much could be and probably will be a soupy, muddy mess. The Lumpy Ridge area gets more sun so should be less messy by then. No matter your choice, as OP said, I would bring spikes or some form of traction if you can. An alternative if you want to be in RMNP proper would be Bierstadt Lake.

"Good morning. Estes full-timer here. Congrats!
It seems to me you have a good understanding of how busy parts of the park can be. I'll tell you that Bear Lake is by far the busiest area of the park and yes, parking can be difficult. As business owners, we really see town take off after Father's Day, so I would say your chances of getting parked are pretty decent. At the least, you'd be forced to take a shuttle up to the area and it would bring you back. 

If it were me, I would also consider doing Gem Lake or something else along the Lumpy Ridge area. The views are stunning nearly every step of the way up. This is a short but somewhat steep hike. Mostly just lots of stairs or an incline, and I would suggest you get Yak Tracks if there is still snow pack (check with the Mountain Shop and can get gear there - Tracks are cheap). Lumpy Ridge really is awesome because of the southern view towards Long's Peak. Even if you only went half the way up, it still would be beautiful.

For restaurants I think you're right on the money with Twin Owls. Another option is Bird & Jim which is a newer restaurant, however you might prefer the view elsewhere although this one isn't bad at all. Some of the other restaurants are situated higher whereas this one is located near a park entrance.

I hope this is helpful! My partner and I are small business owners in town and hope you have a wonderful time!

"It’s similar to what mythandriel said.   My family has been here for 3 years so far.  It’s a great place if you like what the town and area has to offer.   Out doors.   Big box stores like target and similar are all down in the valley.  You’ll get used to trips down.  

The winters are cold and windy, but you still can get outside.  My wife works at a resort in town and they have been extremely busy this winter compared to others.    Choose your heat source carefully.  Propane is expensive.  Very expensive.  Wood burning stoves are excellent and firewood is reasonable. You can get on city gas I believe too.. I’m not sure on that.  Electric too can be expensive.  Above all expect strange and dramatic weather patterns.  We are still in false spring. 

Family life and activities have been in short supply due to COVID, but there is a good library, and a great new rec center.    

Jobs are hit or miss, but lately many positions are empty with the lack of J1 workers.   House keeping is fairly high in demand.

"Covid changed a lot about the live music scene, but I'll tell you what I know so far. Definitely look up schedules closer to July when you're here.

The Stanley Hotel's ""Stanley Live"" was bringing up some amazing/ big name musicians in 2019. I really hope that returns soon. The Stanley also hosts local musicians in their restaurant. They used to also have what was called the Veranda Series where musicians would perform on the front porch on Friday and Saturday afternoons. I hope that also comes back.

Avant Garde Aleworks is a good bet for outdoor music on weekends in the late afternoon during summer.

In the summer, The Rock Inn will likely have live music from 6 PM to 9 PM on Sundays through Thursday. Look them up for details. They may not have much on weekends because they use the stage for dining/table space; however, they sometimes have special concerts after 9 PM on weekends.

Snowy Peaks Winery has outdoor live music from 4:30 to 6:30 pm on Friday afternoons in summer.

Snowygrass is a great local outdoor festival in town. I think it is currently sold out due to limited seating due to Covid. However, I wonder if more tickets will become available if restrictions are eased. 

Lumpy Ridge Brewing sometimes has live music.

The Barrel used to have live music on Friday and Saturday evenings, but I don't know their plans this year.

Every first Friday of the month, the arts district holds their ""Art Groove"". Many galleries and breweries around town will host live music. 

I think Twin Owls Steakhouse still hosts a classical guitarist on weekends. Not sure if that is still going or not. He's a good guitarist.

Nicky's Steakhouse has a live music room. Not sure if current status.

The YMCA used to host a concert series in the summer. Hopefully, that's back with less Covid restrictions.

Performance Park used to have great evening concerts...but again...Covid. no idea this year. Detecting a theme yet?

Friends of Folk Festival is another great live music event in town at Performance Park, but that's probably not til September.

There's more out there, but those are a few highlights. Again, check back closer to July. I really hope the scene can recover this year!


Cowboy Brad is a well-established local musician and plays free concerts in Bond Park (City Hall) at 7 PM on Sundays and Mondays.

Outdoors:
Jeep tours, an ariel adventure park, guided fishing trips, horseback riding, tons of hiking trails, a marina and boat launch, escape rooms, an old fashioned theater. Most weekends through October have events downtown which would be in that website.

"Things you should know: 

None of the hotels have air conditioning. If the day is too hot, crack the windows in the evening/night when it’s cool and close them in the morning and keep bright windows shaded if possible.

Summer is dry. So dry. Often there are fire bans, so check that with the local fire station before you do anything, even grilling.

Weather in the mountains changes drastically with little to no notice. Most days will be warm and sunny, but the possibility of cold rain, wind, cloud cover, hail, etc is totally possible. The key is layers. It is unlikely you will need coats.

Food, the tldr: ignore McDonald’s and domino’s pizza.
99% of our restaurants are amazing. Some highlights:

Antonio’s pizza

Fresh stop (this is inside a gas station, but don’t let that scare you off, it’s really good food)

The Nepali Cafe has a buffet that is delicious.

The Rock Inn is fabulous, all fresh made from scratch in house. It can be expensive, but it’s totally worth it.

The Big Horn is a classic hometown diner, and a locals favorite.

"There is a need for rentals, but *most* rentals are too expensive for *most* people... like, twice the cost of a mortgage expensive.

Your challenges as I see them: 
-Setting a long term rental price point that makes it cost effective for your renter and financially acceptable to you.
-if you Airbnb instead, you have to work with the town. There is a limit on how many short term rentals are allowed, and I believe there is a waiting list.

"Emerald lake for an easy scenic hike. Sky Pond for a longer and more adventurous hike. Mills lake is also a good option. 

Please stay on trail. There are several established resting points along the trail and plenty around the lakes for you to eat lunch. 

Even if you’re just 20-30 yards away from trail, you are still stepping on vegetation that should be preserved and left alone. If every visitor goes off trail 20-30 yards wherever they like, the surrounding environment will be impacted. It’s the little things that people think don’t matter, matters. 

Please also use the outhouse at the beginning of the trail so you don’t have to try to go to the bathroom along the trail.

"I second ...Frosting's advice.  Get up early one morning (to beat the crowd) and drive to Bear Lake trailhead and take the Nymph-Dream-Emerald Lakes trail.  This is one of, if not the most popular trail, in the park.  We have hiked it in summer/fall/winter and it is always beautiful.  But it does get crowded so start as early as possible otherwise you will have to shuttle into it with 60 of your new best hiker friends.  Especially in July.  Being July, get to know the shuttles.

Also, I too send people down to Wild Basin trailhead.  Escape the crowds!  It is one of my favorites for all the reasons mentioned above.

Want a bit different hiking experience?  Go to Lumpy Ridge trailhead and hike up to Gem Lake and down the backside for a while and then turn back.  The loop is too far for your stated 8 miles max.

LNT and read Eric's book below on trail etiquette.

"I highly recommend getting a copy of “Hiking RMNP: The Essential Guide” by Erik Stensland, who is kind of the Ansel Adams (/Tom Bombadil) of RMNP. 😄

"There are no bad views in the park. That said, I do have some suggestions:

It’s worth the extra drive time to hike from the Wild Basin entrance. Waterfalls, lakes, wildflowers like crazy, it’s less known so not as crowded as the main parts of the park.

If you do go see the popular trails, go the distance. For example, everyone and their mother goes to bear lake, but if you keep going you can hit the falls, dream, nymph and emerald lakes beyond that. 

Personally I would avoid hiking out from the west side and cub lake trailheads as that area took damage in the fires this past fall.

So, someone mentioned to LNT (leave no trace) meaning pack out everything you pack in. Good advice. Also good advice is to stay on established trails. I want to touch on that a little bit:

Is it illegal to hike off trail in RMNP? No.

Should you hike off trail? No. 
Why? We have way too many people get lost/stuck/need rescuing and die every year. Personal safety in an unfamiliar environment needs to be your number one priority. But, beyond that, we also want visitors to KEEP the area a nice place to visit. We have had too many wildfires caused by careless visitors screwing around where they don’t need to be. We have had too many bears put down for having access to trash left by visitors. Too much damage done to alpine areas from people trampling the delicate and slow growing tundra.


Food. The bottom line is don’t go to the chains if you want really good food. Beyond that, I recommend The Nepali Cafe buffet, Antonio’s Pizza, and The Big Horn as my personal favorites.",t2_v8qogpf,Flammablefrosting,0,1616546178.0,0,t1_grzu6t0,grzu6t0,True,bostonmama95,t3_mbs2sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstesPark/comments/mbs2sg/good_trails_in_rmnp/,Good trails in RMNP?,/r/EstesPark/comments/mbs2sg/good_trails_in_rmnp/grzu6t0/,12,r/EstesPark,0,12

"Go to the Estes Park Mountain Shop and rent snowshoes & poles.  I think it's still $6 per set per day.  Then drive up to Bear Lake and hike to Nymph, Dream, and Emerald Lakes.  Or if there's a parking spot open at Glacier Gorge, park there and go to Mills Lake or The Loch.  There are many other hiking options, but these are good intro hikes with great views, no guide needed.  If that's your Day 1, you'll have a sense of whether you want something easier or harder for Day 2.  

If you're hiking while it's snowing or blowing, it's extra important to maintain good situational awareness of the route you're taking and how the weather is changing, and be willing to head back to the car.

"While that sounds like a good idea, the RTD bus route from Boulder to Nederland is why Ned has a huge problem with homeless encampments. There was an article in 5280 magazine that was shocking, I'm sure you can find it online. Ruby Gulch and the West Mag areas are particularly effected with lots of trash, drug use, and petty/violent crime. EP would have plenty of nearby areas for homeless encampments to start up, which is why I don't ever want RTD service.

"I’m not sure you’ll be able to sit down at a restaurant with that many dudes. Maybe you will? Idk, I haven’t seen groups that large in any restaurant in Colorado over the past year. I believe the restriction here is a maximum of two households with 10 or fewer individuals at Airbnb’s, restaurants, or any public gatherings.

Antonio’s pizza is really solid, NY-style pizza. I really like oppa too for Asian fusion type takeout. There’s also a few great authentic Mexican restaurants here — el mex kal and la cocina de mama. There’s really not much nightlife around here to be honest but there’s a few good breweries — avant garde is probably my favorite and they have a nice outdoor section. The barrel has the best selection of local beers and they also have a decent sized outdoor patio. For cannabis I highly recommend grabbing some flower from 14er in Boulder if you’re passing through on your way up. Best bud in the state IMO. There aren’t any dispensaries in Estes.

Can’t go wrong in RMNP. You won’t be able to drive to the top of trail ridge road, but the bear lake area offers tons of fantastic hikes. Not sure what your physical ability level will be across the group but sky pond will be the best hike you’ve probably ever done. Get micro spikes for ice, even in April.

"Congratulations on the soon to be little one!

I don't think you all need any kind of a guided tour. Asking on here, buying a guide book, and looking up other online recommendations should give you more than enough awesome stuff to do for 3 days. I'll list a few things below. That being said, one thing to keep in mind is that snow is always a very real possibility in March. Being from Colorado means it shouldn't be too new but should be part of your planning.

Depending on how active and fit you both are, some good places would be:

As far up Trail Ridge Road you can go. They don't plow it in the winter and so it closes, but you can go part way up (I think it's open to Many Curves point now) which always has gorgeous views.

Deer Mountain in the park isn't a super difficult hike and gives phenomenal views of the most popular valleys on the Estes side of the park. And when everything is covered in snow, it's an even better view.

Lily Mountain (technically in the park, but with parking just on Highway 7) is also a fairly doable hike for most people with good views of the Estes Valley.

Alberta Falls is one of the easiest falls to get to at only 1 mile in. But it was frozen the last time I went a month ago and might be still in March (someone else might know better than I). 

Lily Lake and Bear Lake are both super accessible and easier walks ~1 mile and are gorgeous when covered with snow and ice (and as long as it's cold enough can be walked out on! Seeing snow men in the middle of the lakes is always fun).",t2_biw61bc,s8ki9,0,1614019574.0,0,t1_godayzi,godayzi,True,Nickthelocksmith,t3_lpuxys,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstesPark/comments/lpuxys/looking_for_a_private_guide_for_estes_park/,Looking for a private guide for estes park!,/r/EstesPark/comments/lpuxys/looking_for_a_private_guide_for_estes_park/godayzi/,6,r/EstesPark,0,6

"So, Loveland ski area is a long drive from Estes  Park. Make sure you know where you’re going, in comparison to where you’re staying.
Trail ridge road is closed in the winter, which is part of why that drive is so long. So, if you’re actually staying in Estes and driving to Loveland ski, you’ve got a canyon to drive and i70, which has a nasty reputation in bad weather. And then you have to come back.
