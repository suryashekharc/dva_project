There is a family on Strathcona and Lakeside that (in my opinion) are horrible pet owners. They have one if not more husky’s they let roam the streets or escape often. I have almost seen their dog(s) get hit by cars routinely. I would guess this beauty is one of theirs. I am not sure if they are breeders but I once saw two husky puppies outside in their front yard without a leash playing with just their ~5 year old kid. Their dog(s) never have collars on. They live on the right hand side of the street if your coming from Park Ave right after the turn on to Lakeside.,t2_uevze,MadLove1348,0,1648977346.0,0,t1_i37dhc1,i37dhc1,True,Blagues_Blanca,t3_tus7ok,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tus7ok/anybody_lose_a_handsome_huskie_around_the/,Anybody lose a handsome huskie around the Edgewood/Roger Williams Park area in Cranston?

"Yay! Fellow bunny friends! I live here & run **BinxBox.net**, plus volunteering with several local rescues on rabbit stuff.

For rabbit vets, I highly recommend Dr. Wietsma at Coventry Animal Hospital or Dr. Saslaw at Wickford Vet Clinic. There aren't too many exotic vets in providence proper, but most places are less than 30 min drive away. Ocean State Vet Hospital is 24 hours with exotic vets on staff as well.

For a great PVD experience, living on the East Side is probably the best, especially if you're in your 20's. Lots of walkability & it's super safe. Most apartments will be converted homes into 3-4 apartments.

Providence is AWESOME for vegetarian & vegan options. We're foodies here & almost any restaurant you go to will have great options. Nice Slice is a great pizza place with vegan & gluten free options too & they're AMAZING. But seriously, almost everywhere you go will have amazing vegetarian food. Indian & mexican food here is pretty amazing. Chilango's in Olneyville (borough of PVD) makes their own tequila & it's heavenly.

West Side is the place with the better bars & restaurants, in my option, plus more of a social life. But you don't have to live over there to enjoy it. Ogies, Julians, Nick's on Broadway, The Avery... So many awesome places.

"First of all, [hate is not a bad thing](https://questioner.substack.com/p/pepe-does-politics).  If somebody treats you unfairly, they deserve to be hated for it.  Are the Proud Boys a hate group?  Sure, I'm not denying that.  The real question is, do the people they hate *deserve* to be hated?  That's the question that most leftists don't engage with, and that's what makes many of you hypocritical losers.  For example, you hate Israel and you say that *your* hate is totally justified because of their actions, but when the Proud Boys hate *you* for equally justifiable reasons, suddenly *they're* bad people?  Seems to me like a lot of their hate towards you is equally as justified (if not more justified) as your bigoted hate towards Israel.

Either it's OK to hate people and the only issue is hating the correct target (in which case, we should be having a discussion of whom the Proud Boys hate and why), or hate is never OK at all (in which case you should feel ashamed and stupid for your bigotry against the Israeli people).  Unlike you, I'm not a hypocrite: I say that it's entirely OK to hate people, as long as your hate is justified.

Second of all, just because the Proud Boys are a hate group doesn't mean that they're white supremacists.  There are tons of hate groups that exist on both the political Left and political Right, and all of them have different agendas and hate different people.  Antifa is a hate group.  BAMN is a hate group.  It's highly ignorant to assume that all hate groups are associated with White supremacy, and it's hypocritical of you to criticize hate groups when you clearly belong to an anti-Israeli hate group yourself.  Based on their racially diverse membership, the Proud Boys clearly are not anti-minority, they're anti-immigrant.  There's a big difference between *nationalism* (which is good) and *white nationalism* (which is bad) and I don't think you seem to recognize that.",t2_5c9rslgy,SocratesScissors,0,1648824107.0,0,t1_i2zlpt3,i2zlpt3,False,commandantskip,t3_tt8v66,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tt8v66/proud_boys_at_the_statehouse_i_hate_ri_nazis/,Proud Boys at the Statehouse.

"There's a lot of bars and restaurants that have activity nights such as Karaoke or Trivia nights. Trivia nights are always fun because they put you into groups. 

Also cigar bars have a ton of regulars and they love talking to strangers. Tel Aviv waterfront is the best because they do have outdoor seating so it's not too smokey for you, and the girls that work there are so friendly. 

When I first moved here, I went to gay bars just so I can meet men who wouldn't be attracted to me and I could just drink with and every bar besides Eagle was so welcoming. I say Eagle because it's the type of bar where they wear leather and flirt, so they aren't there to make chit chat with random lost girls. 

Also, if you're into art there's AS220. It's an association that you pay I believe 20-50 dollars a month (last time I checked) and you have access to literally every art medium out there including 3D printing, which as an artist, I say you're paying too little. But yeah that association has a studio, apartments, a gallery and their own bar, so you meet a lot of people that are members and frequenters and they all already have an interest in art. 

Here's the thing, providence isn't a pretentious place, people want to know other people because a lot of them have lived here all their lives and know just about everyone. I'm an introvert and I stuck out like a sore thumb. Random people on my street would say hello and introduce themselves asking where I'm from. You're gonna do fine.

"Anti immigration is not the same as white supremacy.  I'm very anti-immigrant myself, simply because I understand that mass migration from climate change is a big deal, and has the potential to collapse our social safety net and indeed society itself.  A lot of radical leftists would call me ""racist"" for trying to reduce immigration, but that's not true - I'm just a pragmatic person who understands that our social safety net has an upper bound, and that unlimited migration is unsustainable.

As for anti-semitism, why do I always see left-wing groups supporting Palestine and calling for the destruction of Israel?  Isn't that the most anti-semitic position of all?  I don't know much about the Proud Boys, but I don't believe they've ever called for the destruction of Israel, and they seem to be a very racially diverse group.  So calling them ""anti-Semitic"" or ""white supremacist"" is just crazy.

In our modern society, calling somebody a racist is just about the worst slur you can use against them, and that's why the Left overuses the term and tries to label anybody whom they disagree with as ""racist"".

"Previous versions of this (for assault ban at least) did not have a grandfathering provision, simply stated that they must be turned in to police, sold out of state or destroyed. This one does.

Now the proposed bill (page 4, 11-47.1-4) would have you register it with local police (ugh), pay $25 per gun and go in for fingerprinting.

Now, consider that this forces legal owners to now have to go in to pay for a gun they already own and passed a federal check on and submit to further local police scrutiny and payments to them. Then consider that an AR15 hasn't been used in a violent crime in RI in the last decade that I can find info on and that all rifles nationwide (according to the FBI's provided stats) contribute to roughly 1% of firearm homicides.

How does this bill make RI citizens safer? What swath of gun crimes does this address? If this bill was passed a decade prior how many lives would it have saved (roughly zero). Can you think of any reason that certain groups of people might not want to go to their local PD to let them know exactly what guns they own and pay them money to get fingerprinted? How many criminals are going to line up to register their weapons and pay money / get fingerprinted?

“The Proud Boys glorifies violence, and the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has called the group an ""alt-right fight club"" that uses rhetorical devices to obscure its actual motives.[16][17][18] The organization has been described as a hate group by NPR's The Takeaway and the SPLC.[19] The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has described the Proud Boys as ""extremist conservative"" and ""alt lite"", ""overtly Islamophobic and misogynistic"", ""transphobic and anti-immigration"", ""all too willing to embrace racists, antisemites and bigots of all kinds"", and notes the group's promotion and use of violence as a core tactic.” [wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys)

">turn you into a felon if your gun has more than 10 rounds 

Yeah, this is not true.  Any gun you already own will be grandfathered in under the assault weapons ban.  Actually read the text of H6615.  

The high capacity magazine ban does ban any magazine with capacity over 10 rounds (no grandfathering). 

>But they the politicians are exempt 

No, politicians are not exempt from this law.  Current and retired cops are exempt though.

"If I'm reading this correctly (and someone please correct me if I'm not), the assault weapon ban (H6615) and the high capacity magazine ban (H6614) are not going to be up for a vote this year (they're stuck in House Judiciary Committee).

>The House Judiciary Committee, unlike its Senate counterpart, is not holding another hearing this year on the annual bid to ban ""military-style assault weapons'' and feeding devices capable of holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition.

Any guns you already own that fall under their definition of ""assault weapons"" will be grandfathered in (with registration required within 1 year), so no, they aren't taking your guns away (nor will . The magazine ban is more aggressive -- no grandfathering, all magazines with capacity over 10 rounds will be banned.

Great, I'm not and never have. I am arguing over the fact that the Providence subreddit (which seem to be comprised of middle class+ folks from my observation of years on here) and the upper middle class community thinks it's some godsend, authentic, cheap place when in reality it's expensive garbage.

> Youre just obviously annoyed by how other people choose to spend more on tacos than you. 

Then they write a review saying it's the best thing ever and it gets extremely popular for all the wrong reasons. When people ask on here or google ""best tacos in RI"", what do you think comes up? What are the top voted answers? That's my issue. People are misled to believe this crap.

"While it is a ""locally founded chain"" it has been owned by an international consortium for some time so thats like saying Dunkin is the best local coffee shop around, and yes way in hell trader Joes can be more cost effective than stop and shop especially as of late.  The best option would be an Aldis but that isn't happening. Again Stop and Shop has a presence in the city and it is the most expensive option here. Yeah Joe's brand might be the only option in a lot if cases but it is also the cheaper option. Great example is coffee, their coffee is like $7 a can the cheapest God awful brand at stop and shop is at least that. Their spices are $1.50 for most of them and most of their blends stop and shop $3 minimum and going way beyond that. Are there items cheaper at stop and shop yes but that could be said for any grocer. 

So we shouldn't build anything anywhere? The term you are looking for is revitalization not gentrification. The spaces that are being built up are formerly empty lands that were form parcels of highway or buildings that are rundown and in need of major repair. 

Gentrification is what is happening in the Olneyville section of Providence where people are being displaced, what is happening in the Point Street area is not gentrification, it is the same as has always been done there. The whole East Side is that way, how do you gentrify an area that already has some of the most expensive homes in the state and has a large portion of it owned by Brown? I have been here for 15 years this is the same as it has always been. It has actually gotten much better recently since they are incorporating open/public spaces more than they have in the past. We have so many run down empty buildings just falling into disrepair in the city that something needs to be done with them.

"A modern shitty city has more to do with local government and corruption than it does corporate lobbying. Bad politicians and leaders will fuck it up one way or another. Also it’s us Voters’ fault for not making lobbying illegal, it’s literally bribery.

Health industry is a mess. Pharmaceutical industry is a mess. Public education is a mess. Infrastructure such as bridges are a mess. Electrical grid is a mess. Water is tainted with lead and toxins. Run away higher education costs. Run away debt. Shrinking middle class. **we’re fucked** 


Everything is getting worse over time in this country. The whole car/roads public transit argument has less to do with that singular industry and **much more to do with corrupt politicians being allowed to take bribes for corporate interest**

"So would you prefer a Stop and Shop or Shaws? Trader Joes is much more affordable than either of those too especially if you include the ""small grocer"" East Side Market which is now just a Stop and Shop with higher prices.

Aldi's would be a good option but I don't think they would wanna foot the bill to be located under and apartment building.

I agree that having chains everywhere is bad but some things really do need to be a chain or they just aren't going to be able to have affordable prices. Look at Rory's Market downtown they are pretty expensive.

Wickenden will not go the same route as Thayer St as it is not as densely packed business wise. But you also can't keep storefronts empty because they aren't a small business. That negatively affects jobs in that area and brings down the neighborhood with empty businesses. 

Thayer still has plenty of great local businesses but there needs to be something to fill those giant storefronts and that is where the larger chains come in.

I am not happy that a Trader Joe's is going in at that location, but I also wouldn't have been happy with any grocery store in that location based on how it will affect the traffic at that specific location. Hell if they moved it a little up the road up near Tops Electric It would have been much better or even across the road in some of the 195 space.

"So much on this thread to talk about RE history of Greater Providence development, income distribution and trees. But, I want to focus on the link to the tree equity score site. What it shows to me is something I have suspected, at least with respect to New England, ever since the ""tree equity"" conversation began. There fundamentally is no real pattern at all except to show that there really is no repeatable pattern. Case in point: Newton and Boston seem to have about the same distribution of trees, but not income. Watertown seems to be really bad off, but it certainly isn't as poor as Boston. It seems to be much more about high density housing and non-residential development more than anything else. Same goes for Providence. Providence seems to have more trees than either E.

">The car isn't the problem, people making the decisions and implementing them are.

What do we mean by ""The car"" here?  My car, your car, a few cars - how can that be a problem?  Yet having millions of them is just about the biggest problem we have.

What do we mean by ""People making the decisions?""  Every car exists because a person decided to purchase it.   Each such decision was an insignificant event, but in the aggregate these decisions changed everything.  Small decisions added up to a tyranny.

As the automobile age got going streets like Elmwood, Reservoir, Broad Street, Post Road, the only places to drive in or out of the city became unbearably clogged with traffic.  City officials who decided to cut the trees down and widen the streets were merely obeying this tyranny.

When 4 lane avenues did not solve the traffic problem, limited access highways looked like the answer.  I guess people actually expected traffic to mostly vanish from Elmwood Ave etc. when drivers became able to zip out on the new I-95.  But instead of relieving traffic on local city streets, the highways pour traffic from out of town onto them.  And people who enjoy living on quiet suburban streets fail to see any offensive absurdity when they say ""I would not want to live in the city with all that traffic and pollution - I can just drive there in a few minutes anytime I want!""

Anyone proposing any step to turn this mess around gets shouted down for starting a ""War on Cars.""  Fuck that.   There has been a war for 100 years.  How many people do you know who have been killed or hurt in a crash?  People beginning to question the tyranny is the beginning of the end, not the start of a war.",t2_xqu2g5,listen_youse,1,1648571796.0,0,t1_i2l08j3,i2l08j3,False,Shouldvegotafalcon,t3_tqzody,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tqzody/providence_same_street_130_years_apart/,"Providence, same street, 130 years apart",/r/providence/comments/tqzody/providence_same_street_130_years_apart/i2l08j3/,-4,r/providence,0,-4

"As someone that was very strongly impacted by Lyme disease throughout my lifespan and have done a reasonable amount of reading and research, I have NEVER heard of this term. I haven't done much research in probably ten years so maybe that's it. But strong comment here.

EDIT: So what exactly is the criteria? Does this have to do with the Western Blot and the bands? I had a significant clinical presentation of chronic Lyme and tested positive for (IIRC) the 3 non-active bands (IgG?) and negative for the 5 or 7 'active infection's bands - I was treated based on the sx and not the test results, fortunately.",t2_52k0fiy3,corrupt_gravity,0,1648418952.0,0,t1_i2d64gg,i2d64gg,False,nowifnotwhen,t3_tptu5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/providence/comments/tptu5x/tick_season_lyme_diagnostic_manipulation/,Tick Season & Lyme Diagnostic Manipulation,/r/providence/comments/tptu5x/tick_season_lyme_diagnostic_manipulation/i2d64gg/,3,r/providence,0,3
It might boost visibility if you explain a bit of what is meant by “Lyme diagnostic manipulation” so you’ll draw more people in to reading more.
