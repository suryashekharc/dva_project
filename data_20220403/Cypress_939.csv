Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Look if I am wrong about the high voltage issue feel free to provide me with information on there not being issues. I just have read on my own that there could be the potential. I don't have the data and this is really a tangent of the real issue. If the high speed rail is approved it has the potential to cross through a community. There are purchase order agreements from builders that write this in into the contract making you aware that this can happen in the future and they the builder is not liable for decrease in home property values.

"Hey! Cypress is a great place to settle! I'm a Realtor in Cypress but have also lived here since 1986 (when I was a kid ;)).  
  
The first thing to know is Cypress is big! We have nicer areas, less nice, more expensive and less expensive. I'd say we have a nice amount of Diversity, but I think most of Houston will. You don't have to search too hard to find it's a fairly global city.   
  
As far as groceries, HEB is going to be your easiest access to food, but we have Sprouts (one on 249, one on Hwy 6), and a Whole Foods off of 249. We do not have a Trader Joe's (yet!) but there are several in town. There are more and more farmer's markets around, and similar, so finding fresh food (except seafood for some reason), isn't too difficult.   
  
Houston itself is about 30 minutes away from Cypress, except during going to work/coming home times. Freeways give you options depending on where you want to go, so 290, Grand Parkway, Beltway, etc. are your friends!   
  
The rental market is strong in Houston. You can find a rental in some areas of Cypress for $1600, but probably not in the newer areas and probably more like a 3 bedroom/2 bath older home. $2000-2200 and up is probably a little more reasonable, but there are always new properties coming available.   
  
CFISD has a good reputation, but again, there are some better rated schools in certain areas. Check out greatschools.org for more details there.

"I'm glad Bridgeland was able to avoid severe flooding.  Sorry to hear about Townelake and Fairfield.  Inside the loop in Houston the flooding is common near the bayous. After Harvey I recall passing by over a dozen houses near Brays Bayou that had piles of their wooden floors ripped out and placed in their front yards due to the flood damage. 
 
At least two of the older home owners next to Brays decided to have their houses elevated at least 4 to 5 feet on a massive cinderblock and/or brick foundation.  I heard from one insurance company one homeowner spent over $30,000 to raise up the old home.

"Great value Bridgeland 😅

They will soon be rezoned. There’s a new elementary coming over there in mirmesa in a few years. Although they currently aren’t zoned to the same HS as Bridgeland residents.

I think initially they thought Wells would be able to take them in but the school is currently 180% versus capacity. It’s a nightmare. Each grade level has 12-14 teachers 🤣

They will remain at Wells and I assume smith next year. But once the mirmesa elementary opens they’ll go there. That’s why they didn’t zone them to the new elementary school in Bridgeland on tuckerton opening this August. They didn’t want to have them go from Wells to ES57 to the mirmesa ES in the matter of 3 years. So they’ll stay at Wells even though they will have to pass ES57 to get to Wells. Probably stay at smith when all Bridgeland gets rezoned to the new MS in 2023.

They already are zoned to ranch so they’ll stay there. At smith half the kids go to ranch (CCL, blackhorse, BC) and the others go to Bridgeland (Bridgeland residents obviously). Townelake kids are at Anthony which I don’t think they’re thrilled about because they get a lot of the crappier neighborhoods closer to 529.

Also the other side of 99 won’t be at Cy fair schools outside the initial section they’re building currently.

"Just FYI I the next few years fry should get better. Mason will go all the way through Bridgeland to alleviate some traffic.

Anyway they’ll finally connect Mason and meuschke will be built out south of 290.

"Martin Luther, father of the Protestant movement, wrote this letter in 1527 in the midst of an outbreak of the bubonic plague in Wittenberg, Germany. He was responding to a Lutheran leader in Breslau, who asked whether a Christian ought to leave a city in the midst of a plague outbreak for someplace safer.

In his treatise, Luther wrote:

“Therefore I shall ask God mercifully to protect us. Then I shall fumigate, help purify the air, administer medicine, **and take it**. I shall avoid places and persons where my presence is not needed in order not to become contaminated and thus perchance infect and pollute others, and so cause their death as a result of my negligence. … See, this is such a God-fearing faith because it is neither brash nor foolhardy and does not tempt God.”

"Hold on to your hats, I live in CCL.  I also lived in Village of Cypress Lakes (north of 290 off Cypress Rosehill which is just Fry).

The biggest issue in the area is traffic.  290 and Fry sucks, Fry at Cy-Ranch also sucks.  290 and Barker Cypress is also terrible.  They are adding additional roads but they are adding a ton of houses also.

Crime: The worst crime is people stealing from cars at night.  A few people have had their catalytic converters stolen.  In VoCL there were a lot of rims being stolen.  But more people drove big trucks there.  There have been some recent shootings but they are outliers.  The shooting at the Kroger seems to have been DV.

The schools are great.  Our teen had a lot of issues in HS, he was eventually diagnosed with autism.  The schools handled it professionally.  

Now on to each neighborhood.

**Bridgeland**: Bridgeland is so nice it's stupid.  If there had been a house available in my price point then I'd have moved there.  Very walkable, lots of small and large parks, trails everywhere, and easy access to 99.  It also has a lot of houses for sale plus new builds. HOA is proactive but still controlled by the builder.  

**Cypress Creek Lakes**:  Great place.  Good schools, easy access to stores, lots of walking paths.  The biggest issue is the lack of sidewalk along Fry to Cy-ranch.  Good luck finding a house.  They sell rapidly.  I checked HAR and there is only 1 house for sale not under contract.  

**Miramasa**:  Nice place but less access to stores and further from 290.  I've heard some bad things about their HOA because the builder is keeping control using some tricks (It's the same HOA that runs Stone Gate).  Also I think they are zoned to slightly worse schools.  

**Black Horse Ranch**:  Older neighborhood with a golf course.  I think they had some flooding problems.  Looks nice when I drive by.  I know a few people that live there and they like it (They are golf people.)

**Towne Lake**: Nice houses and very walkable but less parks than Bridgeland.  If you want to boat this is the place to be.  But you'd have to drive up Barker Cypress and rush hour traffic is bad.  The Boardwalk has some great places to eat.  

**290 and Mason**:  Bridgeland sold off some of their land near 290 to a different developer.  They are suppose to build a subdivision between Bridgeland and 290 off Mason.

"So a good portion of the answers will depend on if you're looking in the Jones Rd side of Cypress or the Cypress Rosehill to Fairfield side. 

1. Medical - two hospitals with a 10 mile span, both directly off the 290 feeder, three physical therapy facilities as well (span is from Huffmeister to Mason)

2. Grocery - provisions almost 100% back to normal. Not as ""survival of the fittest"" out here - less people than the inner city and plenty of grocery options within same span (HEB x2, Kroger, Food Town, Costco, etc.)

3. Amazon - typically same timeline

4. Good news and bad news - nuisance noise enforcement greatly depends on the subdivision you choose. Most HOA's contract out a police officer to patrol their neighborhood periodically and would be the person to request assistance from in that event. If you're going to a new subdivision backing up to an old established neighborhood lacking in deed restrictions or high in petty crimes, probably won't have much luck. Check NextDoor App to get a feel for the neighborhoods surrounding your future home. 

5. Power - depends on location. If on a hospital power grid, no worries. Most of new development in Cypress since the 2010s has put in buried power lines which significantly reduces the loss of power with just a storm brewing in the distance.

6. Flooding - YES. Lots of creeks, lots of flood plains. Ongoing work to improve drainage, reinforce creek shores, improved flood gage reporting and access to info is all underway, all the time. Strongly recommend you review flood maps in Cypress while narrowing down options.

"I want to pop in on this post now that we’re in the spring semester.

We have a huge teacher, substitute, and bus driver shortage, too. At my school we have around 5 busses showing up late every day. In the afternoons, there are multiple routes joined together (kids tell me they are sitting about 5 to a seat) or they have to sit and wait for hours for a bus to deliver multiple routes and come back to get them.

"No ones knows if and when there will be a correction. The simple fact is there is a significant demand for Ranch style houses less than 2000 sq ft which command a premium. Tenants have realized you get more space for your buck and it’s easier to deal with small time landlords then to deal with institutional apartment owners. Covid has amplified this realization. 
For now, the result of non-stop money printing by FED is an asset bubble. Inflation is real. So is labor shortage. So is the fact that a lot properties in TX are significantly cheaper than their replacement value. Even the new McMansions are fraction of what they will cost in California.

"We're starting to see houses sit where someone just bought it in 2020 and is now trying to get 100k more for it. One house in bridgeland was bought for 325k in Feb 2020 and they have listed now for 499k and have done nothing to it to improve it since it is still a new home. A lot of these houses need a lot of work but the owner is seeing dollar signs and no one is biting. In short, there are a number of delusional sellers entering the market and hoping no one will notice they don't fit in the same price range as what they would like to get. I think some people will definitely overpay and get burned later. But there seems to be a price equilibrium occurring. The new builders though are seriously constraining supply and that is giving them and everyone else a license to shoot for the moon on listing prices. When more pre-owned houses that are optimistically priced start sitting for 30plus days is when we will see more hope for buyers not trying to grossly overpay. When houses stop selling in 1 day is when buyers will start to have some leverage to make sane offers.

"Can you be more specific?

I think Fairfield still has many similarities to both the Woodlands and is both in Cypress and CFISD. Within Cypress you also have Cole's Crossing and several other nice areas. Cy Fair ISD covers a huge area, including Bridgelands and Jersey Village.

Personally I'm not willing to live in a place like Bridgelands. It's way too far away for a daily commute. It's the same thing with the Woodlands, though there are at least a lot of large companies in the area.

I considered Cole's Crossing when I was on the market but many of the houses flooded during Harvey and you still pay a premium for them.

"Also didn’t make it clear. We’re in Cy fair so it’s definitely not some sort of district policy to not have crossing guards or anything. Probably self explanatory as this is the Cypress Reddit. It’s probably just simply up to the principal of the school.

The school we’re at has now been open 4 years. The first two hiker/bikers weren’t allowed. It’s in the middle of a very actively developing neighborhood so there were a lot of cement and work trucks driving the main road so the principal didn’t even allow hiker/bikers.

">117,120 students in CFISD

Let's say 5% get infected, and either they get symptoms or not = 5,856. 1 or 2 kids per classroom. No big deal?

Then 0.1% of them die. ""Only 0.1% of 5%"". Sounds low risk, right? 0.005%, why worry?

That's about 6 kids dead. That's the math of pretty big numbers.

"^^^^ Facts ^^^^

We sent our kids into CyFair this year after much debate and prayer.  We talked with them last night about the option to homeschool, if needed.  They were both okay with it because they at least got to try in person.  I totally agree that in person learning is more effective, at the same time, the risk doesn't always equal the reward.   

One thing I think CyFair got totally wrong was forcing the teachers to do in person and homeschooling in the same class.

Why not look at a place like humble ISD. They’ve been open about two weeks longer that Cy fair to come up with some projections based in reality. They’re a month in which will be at the same point of the 61k projection and they’ve had 2.3k cases. They have a third of the student population as Cy Fair so that would equate to about 7k. Your problem is basing your transmission rates on the first week data. They’re weren’t just 300 people with covid that week. It was definitely higher which completely throws off you transmission multiplier.

At a given time there will probably be 0.5-1% of the population with active cases. They won’t shut down for that.

"We're going to make our decision later. Wheels-up Sept 23. We might still delay it. Here's what's letting us continue, with lots of input from a Medical doctor sibling:

1. Weekday travel, not a holiday, kids in school
2. People are cancelling, so passenger volumes could be significantly down in another month
3. Both of us fully vaxxed, age 60 but not overweight, no illnesses, so sister says we're low risk
4. We use N-95 and KN-95 masks, and fit them as well as we can. I wear eye protection, though wife doesn't
5. Uber to/from airports... no parking lot shuttles
6. Stay away from others as well as we can in the airport; avoid people who are eating or drinking; no food court
7. Flying First Class, maybe faster boarding. no middle row at least
8. We are enrolled in TSA Pre expedited security check
9. We won't eat when other passengers eat (masks not off on both ends at the same time). Eat fast. Get mask back down
10. Drink through a straw stuck into the bottom of the mask
11. We can always defer. It's not emergency travel

If we get sick, hope to get sick IN Seattle, not in Texas. Maybe get a quick test just before we come back so we don't get on the plane to Houston as asymptomic transmitters, then wait out 10-14 days up there.

"Hi! Welcome to Cypress soon!! There’s a disc golf course near the Klein Cain High school. I’m not sure if there are newer ones built. Some local food places I’ve loved is pho ton, they have funky hours so check first before you plan to try them. Season harvest is a little on the pricey side but it’s a cool place and rural. There are chickens on the property and horses on the next property; I recommend sitting outside if possible. Rose hill bar-not a brewery but has outdoor seating and local vendors; super friendly staff and very yummy tacos!!!! If you see the bar car, his name is Angus 😺 you can also bring children if you have them... there’s a playground. 

In Houston—You have to try out saint Arnold’s brewery+ restaurant; amazing selections and great environment plus if it rains, there’s coverage. Sticky’s chicken is a great local place ( opened probably 2 hrs or so..?)  and you can walk around there as well; there’s a brewery across the street. There’s just a big food scene in downtown and general area of Houston 😌 discovery green, very cool, very hot. Free museums on Thursday, pretty packed sometimes, and I would recommend checking out the actual installations that’s going on.

"Cy fair has been a very accepting school district and is a great school district, not just in Texas but across the country. I went to school there about 12-13 years ago and we already had a zero tolerance policy on bullying. I am very proud to be an alumna of a cy fair school. Cy creek had some of the best teachers in my whole educational career and they were very open to all walks of life. 

I can’t speak for Cy Ranch, since it was still a very new school in the district when I graduated. They hired my favorite French teacher, Ms. Wadenpful (forget if that was how she spelled her name).

"unfortunately, this is about one of the worst times to move into the area as there is a housing shortage... its a sellers market right now. prices are up about 10-15% over what they were a year ago. so... might be good to rent for a bit and get your bearings. 

but - there is a subdivision and community for just about all ranges from sub 100k to multi million dollar homes. so no matter what your situation is - there is a spot for you. :)

this is a bit of an odd area.... the outer bad of mix between deep red state, and bright blue city politically... so you get a mix of people in that regard. 

lots of great schools if you have kids. 

not sure where you are coming from.... but be prepared for hades level summers. we have the worst mix of ultra hot +100 degree temps and 100% humidity. 30 seconds outdoors, and youve got sweat in places you didnt think could sweat. 

winters are ultra mild... although its been uncharacteristically bad the last couple of years. 

our biggest issue - flooding. especially in cypress. there are some areas that stay high and dry.... others can see 8' of water over the roof of their homes - and we have a yearly flood tradition here - so pay attention to where you go, and make sure you have flood insurance. its absolutely mandatory for some areas.",t2_7a6e0,Microdoted,0,1624133448.0,0,t1_h2cv7x2,h2cv7x2,False,8theDingosBaby,t3_o3hfog,https://www.reddit.com/r/CypressTX/comments/o3hfog/moving_to_cypress_not_from_ca_because_of_a_job/,Moving to Cypress (not from CA) because of a job transfer.

"Solid suburban community in the Houston metro area. Unincorporated, so we're technically under the jurisdiction of Harris County (you'll see more constables / sheriffs than regular police). Pretty much everything you'd want or expect from a suburb - developments, parks, good schools, shopping centers, etc. 

It's a large area, so depending on where your job is, you'll have a variety of commuting options. Usually to get into Houston proper you'll be using 290 or 249 to get you to I-10, I-45, the Beltway, etc. 

More an older family dynamic than younger population you'll encounter in the city. 

Weather wise we're similar to the rest of the Houston area. As we're in the northwest area, we don't get the brunt of Hurricanes like some other areas (but are still affected). Flooding hasn't hit here *as* hard as other parts of the region - but we have the Cypress Creeks that do overflow during events.

Easy to get over to George Bush Intercontinental if you're flying out of town for work (Hobby's a bit more of a drive). 

While not *as* expensive as some other communities, prices have risen here just as quickly as the rest of the region. That affects rentals as well - depending on your situation.",t2_8r6o0,amendmentforone,0,1624117159.0,0,t1_h2bzmtl,h2bzmtl,True,8theDingosBaby,t3_o3hfog,https://www.reddit.com/r/CypressTX/comments/o3hfog/moving_to_cypress_not_from_ca_because_of_a_job/,Moving to Cypress (not from CA) because of a job transfer.

"Depends on what part of Cypress you live in as it's a pretty large area. Are you north or south of 290? Or are you close to 249? As /u/kaytoos mentioned, there's a park and ride bus station at Skinner & 290 that will get you to downtown Houston in about 40 mins - hour depending on what time you leave. If you're driving, 290 to 610 to I-10 will get you there or 249 to Sam Houston to I-45 will too. Rush hour will be the roughest time to be getting there so plan accordingly for classes. Middle of the day is a bit quicker. 

Also, just to note, the Metro busses between Cypress and Houston are (if I recall correctly) essentially operating on a 9-5 schedule.
