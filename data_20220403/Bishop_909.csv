Inyo county is great for retirees until something happens and they need additional services or care.    Many of these services are limited or unavailable altogether.  Many retirees don't consider that when thinking about moving here then get upset when they realize that they will have to leave the area to get services especially if they need special medical care or they are unable to remain safely in the home.    I wish we were more honest with those who want to retire here about those limitations.,t2_5oz3pqq7,Friendly_Reality,0,1648879375.0,0,t1_i32v4f2,i32v4f2,True,biffnix,t3_tr1c06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/tr1c06/best_counties_to_retire_to_in_california_inyo_is/,Best counties to retire to in California (Inyo is #11),/r/Bishop/comments/tr1c06/best_counties_to_retire_to_in_california_inyo_is/i32v4f2/,1,r/Bishop,0,1

"I'm not sure why this was downvoted, and has negative comments, but here's my take.

For schools, it's a function of how engaged and involved in children's lives parents are, which I've found to be the single most important variable for student success.  I've worked in K12 for the past 22 years in both Inyo and Mono counties, and have personally known students who have gone on to Princeton, Yale, Harvard, Stanford, Swarthmore, Johns Hopkins, UCLA, Berkeley (virtually every other UC of course), and just about any elite university you can imagine, all products of our little public schools.  My daughter graduates from Swarthmore in May, and grew up going to Round Valley and then Bishop High.  I think if you are engaged with teachers, and work hard to support your student's success, it's a wonderful place to grow up.  It certainly was for my own children.

Crime is pretty rare.  I haven't experienced any in the 22 years I've lived here, but have known some folks who have.  Usually petty theft (bicycles stolen, skis/snowboard stolen out of truck beds, that sort of thing).  Occasionally there is the tragic violent crime - I remember that shooting at the Bishop 'Y' where someone from out of town tried to carjack a local's truck, and the guy was armed and shot the carjacker, killing him, and the carjacker's girlfriend ran off into the brush, and gave herself up the next day after nearly freezing to death.  That crime alone probably spiked the violent crime statistics, since the population of the county is so low.

For doctors, I've had good experiences at Northern Inyo in Bishop.  The chief of staff a few years ago was Dr. Allison Robinson, who is a colorectal surgeon who saved my life. They detected colon cancer early (stage 1), and performed surgery right here in Bishop, so I didn't have to travel out of town.  She's a surgeon who grew up in Big Pine, and went off to the Navy and became a surgeon.  My daughter was born in Northern Inyo (before the big remodel a while back).  I've always gotten good health care here, but for big problems, patients usually get airlifted to Reno or Carson City.  I know a classmate of my son's who came down with the plague (hantavirus) several years ago, and had to be flown up to Reno, then eventually to UC Davis medical center. He survived, and I've seen him playing at the open mic down at the Looney Bean recently...

My primary care physician is at the Rural Health Clinic here in Bishop, and I've had a pretty good experience there, as well.

I think the most important and useful information I can provide for folks thinking about moving here is that Inyo county is very rural.  Much more so than they probably think.  The nearest town with a Home Depot is Ridgecrest, 120 miles south, in another county, or 2.5hrs north, in Carson City, in another state.  No Trader Joe's, no In-N-Out, not even a general retailer like K-Mart or Walmart.  We have one theater with 2 screens.  

Folks have to be very honest with themselves about how much they want or need amenities, because Inyo and Mono don't have that many.  If you want an Uber/Lyft to get around, that doesn't exist here.  If you want Doordash, or Amazon same-day delivery, that doesn't exist here, either.  Convenience is NOT the norm for rural living.  

But, if you love wide open spaces, incredible scenery, outdoor activities, and a small tight-knit community, you can certainly build a wonderful life here.  But, that really depends on you.  Bloom where you are planted, as they say...

Best of luck to you.",t2_33kr7,biffnix,0,1648470616.0,0,t1_i2fhoak,i2fhoak,True,Negative-Actuator-51,t3_tq15br,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/tq15br/info_on_inyo_county/,Info on Inyo County,/r/Bishop/comments/tq15br/info_on_inyo_county/i2fhoak/,13,r/Bishop,0,13

"The schools are full of teachers who openly stare at the students tits. The crime rate is fairly low comparatively but you have to be an idiot to go along with the people who insist it isn't necessary to lock your cars around here. The community is decent as long as you're straight, cis, white, and racist, but is terrible otherwise. My cousin's son in law openly did a hate crime and now spends his time drinking by the road and screaming at any women who pass by. The cops refuse to do anything because he's a good ol boy and so they automatically take his side in any dispute. Thank fuck the loser finally moved to somewhere else in town.

There is an accessible hospital in Bishop but, as a worker there, I highly recommend going anywhere else that you can reach without dying. They'll do okay with something like a broken arm but almost killed my aunt by insisting her heart was fine at a time that it needed immediate surgery which she got by going to the ED at a different hospital. Nobody follows infection control protocol (I genuinely see violations every single night and I was the one to get in trouble when I reported it) and as a result we were the second highest county in the country for transmission rate during the last surge. My uncle came into the ED suffering from an aneurysm and, after collapsing on the floor and vomiting on himself, was told that he needed to get up and walk into the triage himself if he wanted treatment. That was a lie though since I regularly see them roll out a wheelchair for people who are simply drunk.

Raising your kids here isn't terrible but I will always prefer growing up in Bishop to any big city. After graduating I decided to move to Reno to go to UNR, long story short I decided to move back to Bishop to attend Cerro Coso.

The schools are good, but they are small and limited so you won't get all of the same things you might get with a bigger school but teachers genuinely care and will go above and beyond to help your kids.   
Medical care is also limited.    If you need specialty care you will probably have to go out of the area.

"Hitchhiking is usually not too difficult from Bishop to the South Lake or North lake trailhead in July (lots of anglers and campers/backpacker heading up there), but as a father myself, I would certainly be reticent to recommend to my own daughter to hitch it.

The ESTA shuttle is easy, and probably cheaper than Mammoth Taxi.  Keep in mind that if you are hiking to Piute Pass, you will want the North Lake trailhead, and not the South Lake trailhead (which takes you up to Bishop Pass).  The ESTA shuttle will drop you at the intersection with the North Lake road (it's just before you get to Sabrina Lake), so you can hike up the North Lake road to the Piute Pass trailhead.  You have to let the shuttle driver know you want to be dropped at the North Lake road intersection with 168, though.

I've done the North Lake to South Lake loop, so you're in for a treat. Heading over Piute Pass down through the canyon to the San Joaquin River and onto the John Muir Trail / Pacific Crest Trail is just some of the best high Sierra scenery there is, especially if you're visiting Evolution Valley during your trip.

"Yes of course!  The one's I photograph run between Big Pine and Buckley ponds, with Saunders pond always a pitstop for them. They haven't been at Buckleys in the last 6 weeks. They are always there before the cattle start having babies and then they chase the placenta.  In my opinion these are not the round valley and pleasant valley family.

North of Big Pine is where this family has been hanging out in the mornings and later in the day from what I've heard from my DWP friends.. Its been a few weeks since I've looked for them  since the fire so I'm out of the loop.

In past years if you head down towards the river at the Aberdeen turn off , the goldens usually fish around there.  I have not been down there this year to look for them.

I feel like we've done this prematurely before and that didn't go well.   But there are too many people many of whom claim to be loving Christians who refuse to help stop the spread and think that the lives of others including the those who are high risk are disposable and they will never wear a mask and since they are so aggressive many businesses and the county have stopped trying to enforce.

"Nobody can predict what will be open or closed in the Sierra towards the end of April. I would like to say that Yosemite is probably a must visit for you though, So July would be a safe bet. From LA, its a slow elevation gain in the high desert until Bishop then you start to climb in elevation, but no giant sequoia's on the east side.",t2_522uzbbf,squashed377,0,1644854126.0,0,t1_hwx530n,hwx530n,True,Wild_Competition_716,t3_ss4kkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/ss4kkz/travel_planning_questions/,Travel planning questions!,/r/Bishop/comments/ss4kkz/travel_planning_questions/hwx530n/,1,r/Bishop,0,1
"April is always hit-or-miss weather wise.  We've had a historically dry Winter (one huge storm in December, literally nothing since then), but we've also had a few ""Miracle March"" snowstorms, and looks like we may finally get a touch of snow this week.  So you'll just have to check forecasts before you arrive, I'm afraid.

Most passes will still be closed.  Traditionally, Hwy 120 (through Yosemite Nat'l Park) doesn't open until Memorial Day weekend.  Sometimes, Sonora and Monitor passes (the other two passes that traverse the Sierra near Bishop/Mammoth) open earlier, but that really depends on weather.

There are a TON of other hiking opportunities - you can try Bristlecone Pine forest (east of Big Pine) if you want to see some of the oldest trees on earth, for example. By late April, some other trails may start to open up.  Oh, you can always try Bodie, if you're interested in visiting an authentic old West ghost town, too (not too far from Mammoth).

For giant Sequoia, you'll need to change your travel from Los Angeles a bit, and head into the Southern Sierra Nevada via the West side, I'm afraid..  Usually to get to Mammoth, you just drive up the 405 to the 14, to Hwy 395 and get straight to Mammoth. You won't see any giant Sequoia trees, though.  For that, you'll have to head toward Tulare in the Central Valley, on the other side of the Sierra.  To see the famous grove of giants, and say, the General Sherman tree and such, you'll need to head to Tulare, then head East on Hwy 198, past Lake Kaweah, and then up into the windy section of the General's Highway past Three Rivers.  I honestly have no idea if this will be open in late April, though.  Does anyone else know?

And it's pretty difficult to cross back over to the East side of the Sierra at that time of year, since there aren't many roads that traverse the Sierra, and none that are reliably open in the Winter unless you go south to Highway 178 (Bakersfield on the west, Ridgecrest on the east), or all the way north to Interstate 80 (Sacramento on the west, Reno, NV on the east).  The other highways that traverse are subject to snow closure in the Winter.  Highway 50 (Placerville on the west, South Lake Tahoe on the west), is usually plowed in the Winter, and then you can take either Hwy 89 south to Hwy 395 via Markleeville (if it's open), or 89 to 88 north to Gardnerville and Hwy 395.  Those can also be closed, depending on weather, of course.

"This is a big loss for the valley.  She was always a staunch advocate for her constituents.

I had personal interaction when Digital 395 was being built. Due to rising construction costs, there were plans to move the fiber route away from Round Valley, but she held firm, and kept on the cooperative to build out as originally planned.  It ended up costing almost a million extra dollars, but it got built out through Round Valley - because of her.

Round Valley school became the very first school to sign up for Internet service via Digital 395, and now every school in Inyo and Mono get that same reliable high-speed service via Digital 395.

When the big fire swept through Round Valley a few years back, all of Mammoth lost Internet service, and wireless service because the fiber from Verizon (now owned by Frontier) was on poles, and burned down. But the Digital 395 fiber was just fine, because it's buried fiber along the entire route (from Barstow in the south, to Reno in the north). Verizon ended up having to lease service from Digital 395 for the months it took to rebuild their fiber after it burned.

"First, decide what you’re trying to accomplish, ie; heat your home or power a factory. This is what is called Load. From Load you can do your estimate. The load will always change.

My experience has been that Christians want the rights to stand up for their rights while denying the rights of others.     Too many times they have used rhetoric that is hateful towards groups they don't agree with and then when held accountable for their words and actions that deeply wound others they claim to be the victims.  Everyone has freedom but there is also responsibility for that freedom and sometimes consequences.   So if Christians are being hateful then the consequence is that they are held accountable for hate speech.,t2_5oz3pqq7,Friendly_Reality,0,1642369196.0,0,t1_hsycaxl,hsycaxl,False,biffnix,t3_s4l1j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/s4l1j3/inyo_supervisor_jen_roeser_refuses_to_say_if/,Inyo Supervisor Jen Roeser Refuses to Say If She'll Attend Hate Group Meeting,/r/Bishop/comments/s4l1j3/inyo_supervisor_jen_roeser_refuses_to_say_if/hsycaxl/,4,r/Bishop,0,4

You are not the only hospital employee that has concerns about Covid protocol.   It's sad that they are part of the problem with the spread.

Cases are going to continue spiking until the hospital actually starts to take them seriously. I see covid infection control protocol violations almost every single night I work there. They do stuff like send covid-positive patients to walk around the main hallways with just a paper mask. Last time I reported something infection control was very disinterested in taking down the report and I was the one who got a talking to. They told me to be careful that I don't become the problem so now I just ignore it and do my best to protect myself.

"Here's the article text:

Jessica Sharkey has been teaching for 19 years. This one is the hardest.

Not only is the fourth grade teacher at Bishop Elementary School again facing a roomful of wriggling, masked kids every day, but as many as six have been absent in a given week, making it difficult to keep all students caught up as COVID-19 surges around them in rural Inyo County. The county has had the state’s the highest coronavirus case rate for much of the fall.

With challenges like having students out in quarantine for extended periods, Sharkey, whose school is in Bishop Unified School District at the northern end of the county, says the past several months have been “emotional and draining.”

“You know more is being asked of us and you don’t have more hours in the day,” said Sharkey. “You are trying to be here for all of these kids and be here emotionally and physically.”

Inyo, a vast, rugged county of 18,000 that adjoins the Nevada border and includes Death Valley, as well as eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada and towering Mount Whitney, has struggled like a number of California’s rural counties with the pandemic ravages that affect school kids and adults alike. In September and October, while much of the state saw cases taper off, Inyo’s case rate continued to soar — surpassing even the peak of last winter’s surge which in most places marked the worst period of the pandemic.

In October, the county reported a larger number of pediatric and adult cases, by far, than any other month. As of Wednesday, Inyo’s case rate has fallen to a seven-day average of 43 cases per 100,000 people per day, but it remains among the highest in the state, and is well above the state daily average of 12 cases per 100,000 people.

County hospitals, with 29 beds total, have struggled to appropriately isolate COVID patients, said the county’s Deputy Director of Public Health Anna Scott. Staff levels have been strained. With limited specialist and intensive care resources in the county, and neighboring rural counties struggling as well, severely ill patients have been transferred to hospitals as far away as the Bay Area, Los Angeles and western Nevada, officials said.

“Once we start getting a little strained in our hospital systems, we are concerned about can we move people out fast enough if we have higher severity cases that need a higher level of care,” said Scott.

It got so bad that on Oct. 26 the county’s public health officer imposed a mask mandate for nearly all indoor public settings for the first time since California’s statewide mask mandate was lifted in June. Such restrictions have been commonplace in the Bay Area and much of the state for months, but the mandate drew objection from some residents who complained at Board of Supervisors’ meetings about government heavyhandedness, often referencing conspiracy theories.
Coronavirus Coverage

    What to know about COVID-19 rapid tests heading into the holiday season
    These 6 Bay Area counties have California’s highest vaccination rates for kids ages 5-11

“You’ve heard repeatedly from the public, trying to wake the board up out of a slumber concerning government overreach with COVID masks, PCR tests and pseudo-vaccines,” resident Wes French said during the board’s public comment session on Nov. 16. He compared vaccine and public health mandates to human experimentation.

Other residents, however, backed the mask mandate, including Frances Hunt, who wrote the board that it was a “small price to pay.”

The “mask mandate supports our goal of keeping businesses open and allowing kids to attend schools,” she wrote.

County Supervisor Matt Kinsley asked the county health team to explain what caused the spike. Dr. James Richardson, the county health officer, did not have a specific answer, but said the recent drop in cases was likely due to people wearing masks.

Scott, the deputy health director, said in an interview that the county’s situation likely is tied to factors including the highly transmissible delta variant, school reopenings, and larger community events in the summer compared to last spring. While the county sees increasing compliance with the new mask mandate,“We are hearing some reports of individuals who are observing that people are not always wearing their face coverings in indoor public settings,” Scott said.

The county’s many visitors, who come for its phenomenal outdoor recreation, may have also have contributed to the spread, she said. Death Valley National Park, for example, saw a nearly 50% increase in visitors this year through August compared to the same stretch of last year, though it is not quite back to pre-pandemic levels.

About 63% of Inyo residents 5 and older are fully vaccinated, according to county figures updated Monday. That is slightly lower than the state’s 5-and older vaccination rate of 67%, and significantly lower than the Bay Area’s most highly vaccinated counties. In Marin County, 87% of residents 5 and older are fully vaccinated, and in San Francisco it’s 80%.

But Inyo’s vaccination rates are higher than some other, mostly rural, counties that currently have lower case rates. In Kings and Madera counties, for example, less than 50% of residents 5 and older are fully vaccinated, yet both counties have lower case rates than Inyo.

Rural counties like Inyo, with their limited health care resources, face unique challenges with patient loads that while not numerically large by metropolitan standards still strain the local capabilities, said Dr. Joy Engblade, chief medical officer and hospitalist at North Inyo Hospital, which serves Bishop — Inyo’s largest town, with a population just under 4,000 — and surrounding communities.

“We have to do a lot more and different triages than you would have to do in the city,” Engblade said. She often faces a situation in which, she said, “I kind of have to have a crystal ball to think if this person is going to get worse quickly.”

During the height of the surge, the county tried to keep the hospital patient load down by using an oxygen delivery program for patients residing within 30 minutes of the Bishop hospital who could get by with smaller amounts of oxygen.

“The goal is to decrease exposure for everyone involved — the patient, their family, and all of our staff — so if the patient needs a little bit of oxygen and are otherwise mentally alert and doing okay and [they] live fairly close to the hospital, we try to discharge them home,” said Engblade.

Other challenges include patients, especially older longtime residents, who are reluctant to be transferred out of the area when their condition warrants more elaborate care. “They don’t want to be put on a ventilator or die alone in a far-off hospital,” Engblade said.

One patient, whose kids who went to local schools, stays in her mind. “He didn’t want to be transferred. He just wanted to try and fight it, and you know I had to stay and watch him die, slowly over two weeks.”

“It is not the volume of death that is difficult, it is the connectedness we have to the patient,” Engblade said.

The cases in the schools also have been painful. Infections have risen this fall, along with the spike in cases in the adult population, said Scott.

Between when kids returned to school in August and Nov. 10, 4.8% of Bishop Unified’s 1,941 students have tested positive for COVID. By comparison, San Francisco Unified’s positives were 1.8% of students. The first letter to Bishop Unified parents announcing an exposure at school came four days into the school year. The district has sent out close to 100 more of these parent notifications as of this week.

“What we are seeing is a lot of transmission within households and schools even though schools have a lot of safety measures in place,” said Scott. “It is somewhat perplexing because all the schools have good protocols in place, but they only have so much control.”

County health officials work closely with the school districts on state public health guidelines, Scott said, but they don’t control activities away from school.

Latest news: Complete coverage of the coronavirus pandemic

According to Bishop Unified’s superintendent, Katie Kolker, students have mostly complied with wearing masks, as mandated by the state for all schools.

The district has on-site COVID testing three times per week and beefed up contact tracing.

“We have tried really hard to be as least restrictive as possible while keeping students in seats, but the contact tracing has been overwhelming and hard to keep up with” as infections have escalated in the community, said Kolker.

Despite pandemic-related absences for both students and staff, school goes on. “I can’t stop teaching,” Sharkey said.

As case rates drop, Scott predicts two possible scenarios for the winter in Inyo — one more hopeful and the other darker.

“On the rosy side my projection is that we’re increasing our vaccination rates, week by week, and many people have potentially some natural immunity from this outbreak so we are hoping to keep our case rates low throughout the winter,” she said. “There is light at the end of the tunnel.”

County officials will continue to urge cautious behavior, she added, in hopes of avoiding the bleaker scenario: “We could easily bump our case rates up again as people get together and celebrate through the winter season (based on) what we saw last year.”

“We are hoping it won’t spike to that level again.”",t2_33kr7,biffnix,0,1637953035.0,0,t1_hm6n90k,hm6n90k,True,biffnix,t3_r2qx9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/r2qx9d/how_inyo_county_is_trying_to_beat_falls_worst/,How Inyo County is trying to beat Fall’s worst COVID surge,/r/Bishop/comments/r2qx9d/how_inyo_county_is_trying_to_beat_falls_worst/hm6n90k/,7,r/Bishop,0,7

Strangely, the price per gallon quoted by Eastern Sierra Propane was way more expensive: $3.55.  AmeriGas quoted $2.65/gallon on the phone.

"Right and I think just having a mandate helps. A lot of people aren't wearing masks, not because they are anti-mask, but because there is no mandate. If things start getting a lot worse, I think people will start voluntarily wearing them again with or without a mandate.

Sheriffs refusing to enforce it is a jerk move, but I am not really sure what they can do. The business owners are the ones that have to deal with it, and if someone refuses they can kick them out. If they won't leave, the sheriff will arrest for trespassing. I don't think any police officer has arrested anyone solely based on the mandate itself.

"Hunt is the cheapest but they aren't well known anywhere, AFAIK.

I have Eastern Sierra Propane in Crowley. Their prices are decent but not great. They are stuck in the early 2000s though. It's very difficult to get auto-pay set up. Also, when USPS was backed up last year, they would send out termination notices immediately if you missed the first deadline (I didn't even know I had a bill). That really rubbed me the wrong way. I make sure I log in each week to check for bills now. If I could switch to Hunt, I would, but we are on a community system.

Amerigas is the most ""reliable"" in terms of billing, but very expensive. I have them at my condo in Mammoth and even though my complex has a steep discount, it's still more expensive than what I pay with ESP, and my house in crowley is 3x the usage of my condo in Mammoth.

"Yep, there it is.

>Bishop Ford, citing a shortage of microchips, and thus, vehicles to sell, opted to close its doors last week. Its final day of operation was September 30. The dealership was owned by the father and son duo, Victor and Victor Covarrubias. The younger Victor, reached by telephone this week, said Ford was sending only 2-3 cars per month. And half the parts for the service department were on back order because Ford had been scavenging the parts to build new vehicles.“It’s just a business decision,” said Mr. Covarrubias. “We didn’t know how long we’d have to wait \[for a return to normalcy\]. ”“Dad has buyers lined up for the property,” added Victor. He said he didn’t know what use there will be for the property going forward, but “it’s gonna be something different.” Existing orders for the popular Ford Bronco have been transferred to different dealerships. As for the younger Covarrubias, he said he plans to take some time off before deciding upon his own future and “seeing what jobs are out there.”",t2_285ujb3k,BallsOutKrunked,0,1633968455.0,0,t1_hg8qs1p,hg8qs1p,False,BallsOutKrunked,t3_q5qmcc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/q5qmcc/heard_a_rumor_that_the_bishop_ford_is_shutting/,"heard a rumor that the bishop ford is shutting down, can anyone confirm?",/r/Bishop/comments/q5qmcc/heard_a_rumor_that_the_bishop_ford_is_shutting/hg8qs1p/,5,r/Bishop,0,5

"I love the whole thing about ""we need language that unites, not divides us.""

It's a handy way of saying, ""I don't want to acknowledge that I'm part of anything shitty, that that my ancestors or race has benefited from, while other groups were kept down. That makes me feel bad and I want to feel good, so please restate this in someway whereby I can hold my head up high.""

Like up in Gardnerville and Minden where indigenous people had to be out of town limits before sundown and they blew the airhorn so you'd know it (the horn still blows today!). At a real nuts and bolts level, in that little example, white people could start businesses in town, have shorter and safer commutes, and better access to resources for *decades*. Looking at black America on the east coast, the timelines are longer and deeper. 

And do you know what it costs to acknowledge that I (as a white dude) benefited and continue to benefit from that history? Nothing. It doesn't cost me a single god damn dime. My family still loves me, my hobbies are still enjoyable, everything is fine.

"DEATH VALLEY, CA – On Wednesday, August 18, 2021, Mr. Lawrence Stanback, 60,  of San Francisco, California, died while hiking near Red Cathedral along the Golden Canyon Trail in Death Valley National Park.

&#x200B;

National park staff received a report of suspected heat stroke and CPR in progress at 1:40 p.m. An inter-agency search and rescue was initiated,  with park rangers responding on foot locating Mr. Stanback and  confirming that he was deceased.   

&#x200B;

CHP - Inland Division Air Operations helicopter H-80 responded to assist with the recovery, but winds were too strong to safely land. In the cooler evening hours, national park staff were able to safely complete the recovery. The Inyo County Sheriff’s Office and Inyo County Coroner are investigating the cause of death.   

&#x200B;

Park rangers urge summer travelers to visit Death Valley safely by hiking only before 10 a.m. or at high elevations, drinking plenty of water, eating snacks, and by staying close to an air-conditioned building or vehicle to cool down in.

"**By James Cornsilk
Yesterday at 10:10 a.m. EDT**

**TRUCKEE, CALIF. — ** Situated on the north shore of Lake Tahoe, Truckee has long been a place where well-to-do San Francisco Bay area residents owned second homes, used only for the occasional ski weekend or summer retreat. Then came Airbnb, which took even more homes off the market as they were turned into short-term rentals. What drove things to a tipping point was the pandemic and the sudden release of remote workers no longer bound to their San Francisco desks.

Seeking space to recreate outdoors in the dreamy environment of the Sierra Nevada, many came to Truckee. As the median home price rose to just over $1 million in 2020, many property owners found it prime time to sell. Many longtime renters were suddenly forced to find new places to live, an incredible challenge in housing-strapped Truckee. Posts to Facebook groups by locals looking for new apartments appear almost weekly, with many fearing that they might have to relocate out of town if nothing comes through soon.

“I feel like I’ve been squeezed out. Like you’re at the bottom of the barrel and you’re being dumped,” said Flor Andrade, who has lived in the north Lake Tahoe area for 10 years and is being forced to relocate.

With so many locals leaving Truckee, many are worried that the character of the place could be changed permanently. Others wonder if the new residents will return to their office jobs once their employers call them back, and whether Truckee can shed its “Zoom town” status.

“What I would view as success five years from now is a diverse economy and a year-round economy where we’re not seeing such ebbs and flows on a seasonal basis,” said Dave Polivy, who was the mayor of Truckee during the period of upheaval in 2020. As the owner of outdoor outfitter Tahoe Mountain Sports, he said it would be a “godsend” to his business to have more people in town recreating year-round.",t2_33kr7,biffnix,0,1628605923.0,0,t1_h8ex2sd,h8ex2sd,True,biffnix,t3_p1qbxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/p1qbxp/lake_tahoe_was_already_short_on_housing_then_the/,Lake Tahoe was already short on housing.

"I took the weekend. Hiked to Lower Horton lake Friday, headed up Saturday, slept that night at Horton, hiked back to the car at the trailhead on Sunday  

It was a lot harder than I thought. Once you get to the mine, it’s a lot of loose gravel and tons of rocks that are unstable. While not technically too difficult, I had to find rocks stable enough to find my way up. The deceptive part are there are MANY trails, but those are mostly trails of people coming DOWN. They slide through the sand, gravel and rocks on the way down and create what look like easy trails, but trying to go up them is futile. Don’t be fooled and try. To get up, I had to get to the edges of the chutes, and climb the rocks there that were stable enough to hold my weight.

"I have taken it on a few easy overnighters, and up to the peak of Mt. Tom just this past weekend.  For me, it's got all the features I need, at a really low weight.  In fact, I used it as my summit pack for the Mt. Tom weekend.

[Here's a link to the photos of this past weekend, to Mt. Tom](https://www.flickr.com/gp/biffnix/EL8wFr).

What I liked:

* Light weight
* Perfect bear can pack
* Ergonomically fits me well
* hip belt water carriers are the best I've ever used

What could be better:

* Maybe hip belt pockets? I ended up using a fanny pack to carry convenient items

* I'd like a *slightly* narrower strap, as my [Peak Design camera clip](https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Capture-Camera-Black/dp/B07818LB9D/ref=asc_df_B07818LB9D?tag=bingshoppinga-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=80264400674394&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4583863980104082&psc=1) took some finagling to get on there.

Other than that, I really like it.  Those water carriers are something else, and probably my fave feature. It's literally the ONLY water carrying solution where I haven't had bottles slip out at some point.

Hope you enjoy it, too!

"Here are the school board members you still have time to contact, and below is a sheet of talking points to use if you feel so inclined. 

Edit: I did not write this, I’m just sharing an email I received;

Dr. Claudia Moya-Tanner, President, cmoya-tanner@bishopschools.org
Virginia Figueroa, Vice President, vfigueroa@bishopschools.org
Dr. Taylor Ludwick, Clerk, tludwick@bishopschools.org

Here’s How to help. The Bishop Unified School District Board will be discussing masks and student safety at its meeting on Monday, August 9. The meeting starts at 6:30PM and will be in the Bishop Elementary School cafeteria. There are three effective ways to have your voice heard:
 
1. Rally in support of protecting our children, educators, and community through mask wearing. We will meet at 6PM outside of the Bishop Elementary School cafeteria in advance of Monday’s School Board meeting. Bring a sign for the rally if you’d like to encourage the Board to act wisely. Contact Fran Hunt at franhunt@gmail.com to learn more or take part in the rally.
2. Attend Monday’s School Board meeting at 6:30PM (in person or via Zoom) and briefly speak in favor of common-sense mask requirements which follow the state’s guidelines and sound science. To participate in the Board meeting via Zoom: https://inyocoe.zoom.us/s/98424555900?pwd=ZGVXZ2FiZFM0WFpadHdXMUJGWlk2QT09
3. Email all members of the School Board between now and Monday’s meeting with your thoughts and concerns. It’s fine to send a single, brief, email comment addressed to the full Board:
 
Dr. Claudia Moya-Tanner, President, cmoya-tanner@bishopschools.org

Suggested Talking Points. Pick Your Favorites. A short comment is fine!
 
1. School Board members and Bishop School teachers and staff deserve our thanks for their hard work and service to our community during these challenging times.
2. It’s important that we get children safely back into schools alongside their friends and their teachers. Masks prevent the spread of the virus and not only keep our students and local community safer, but they also help keep our children in their classrooms and our schools operating as normally as possible.
3. The pandemic has taken a toll on children, and it’s not just their education that has suffered but their mental, emotional and physical health. Wearing masks will make in-person learning safer and possible for everyone.
4. Last week, 35 percent of Inyo County's COVID cases were in children 18 and under. Thirteen percent of the County’s population is 12 and under and is ineligible to receive a vaccination, and 54 percent of the total Inyo County population is still unvaccinated. 
5. There are many people who cannot be vaccinated. Children under the age of 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination. Masks are important to protect people who are not fully vaccinated and our whole community, including students, teachers, staff, and other members of their households.
6. Making masking optional puts unnecessary pressure on children who may want (or whose parents may want them) to be masked for their own or their family members’ safety. Optional masking will likely mean mask-wearing children experience harassment and bullying.  
7. As more information becomes available, it is becoming clear that the highly infectious Delta variant is too-easily spread even by people who are vaccinated. COVID cases are rising once again. The Delta variant is as contagious as chicken pox. This makes wearing masks even more important.
8. It’s VERY important for the Bishop School Board to follow guidelines from the California Department of Public Health (https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Schools-FAQ.aspx) for a safe return to school. The sooner public health prevails, the sooner our small businesses and family lives will return to normal. (Note: You can also mention the American Academy of Pediatrics (https://services.aap.org/en/news-room/news-releases/aap/2021/american-academy-of-pediatrics-updates-recommendations-for-opening-schools-in-fall-2021/) and the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/k-12-guidance.html) guidance as well if you’d like.)
9. We cannot permit a loud minority to jeopardize the health and safety of our children, families, and the community at large. The School Board must do all it can to keep our students, families, school employees and our community safer. Masks help keep infections down and schools open to in-person learning. Please enforce mask wearing.",t2_444lpyge,noil05,0,1628371155.0,0,t1_h83kf8t,h83kf8t,True,WrenisPinkl,t3_oznn4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/oznn4c/school_board_meeting_monday/,School board meeting Monday,/r/Bishop/comments/oznn4c/school_board_meeting_monday/h83kf8t/,4,r/Bishop,0,4

"first study is about effects of mask on comorbidity and has nothing to do with covid

second study is about effects of risk reduction during exercising ONLY.

your third study is old af (2004) and needs a published Meta-Analysis for it to remain relevant. 

your fourth study states ""The benefits of using N95 mask to prevent serious emerging infectious diseases should be weighed against potential respiratory consequences associated with extended N95 respirator usage."" Seeming as Covid is a pandemic that has cost millions of deaths within a short timeframe id say this study is contrary to the opinion youre trying to make.

your fifth study talks about increased findings of contaminants and pathogens on the outside of the mask with prolonged use, implying that proper sanitation procedures with mask usage should be employed when wearing masks (i.e., don't reuse masks). This was a problem in the beginning of the pandemic since there were mask shortages in hospitals that forced PCPs to reused their N95 masks, mitigating whatever protection they had against the virus. 

6th study states CANNOT FIND SERVER when clicking on it

7th study states that the research conducted has not been peer reviewed (i.e., is useless)

8th study states that the research conducted has not been peer reviewed (i.e., is useless)

9th study is focused on how well masks work WITHIN THE HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. It clearly states that they don't work when solely used by healthcare workers with high degrees of exposure and risk. Hence the need for surgical gowns/gloves along with hand hygiene.

Your 10th study was conducted with mask usage in order to prevent Influenza infections. Since Orthomyxovirus and Coronavirus have different methods of replication and proliferation, you can't expect it to have the same external validity. 

&#x200B;

Im a doctor and can really keep going regarding the flaws in your studies but its 5pm here and i need to pick up my kid from daycare.

"Dr. Richard O. Johnson, Acting Public Health Officer for Mono County, issued a Local Health Order effective August 6, 2021 requiring the use of face coverings (masks) for both vaccinated and unvaccinated residents and visitors within indoor public spaces.

This Order will remain in effect until rescinded, in writing, by the Mono County Health Officer based on three consecutive weeks of adjusted case of below 6.9 per 100,000.

""During the last six weeks, increased interactions among members of the public have resulted in an increased number of daily new COVID-19 cases in Mono County, with case rates more than quadrupling since reopening on June 15,"" said Bryan Wheeler, Mono County Director of Public Health. ""Community transmission of COVID-19 within Mono County is now considered Substantial by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicators, and we anticipate the rate to continue to increase over the coming days and weeks.""

The Order includes the following:
All persons within Mono County and the Town of Mammoth Lakes, regardless of vaccination status, shall wear face coverings while in indoor public settings, venues, gatherings, and businesses (examples include offices, retail, restaurants, theaters, family entertainment centers and meetings, among others).
Individuals, businesses, venue operators, or hosts of public indoor settings must require all patrons to wear masks, for all indoor settings, regardless of their vaccination status, and post clearly visible and easy to read signage at all entry points to communicate the masking requirements for patrons.
Recommendation: It is recommended that all persons wear face coverings while attending large outdoor public events.

The following individuals are exempt from wearing masks:
Persons younger than two years old. Very young children must not wear a mask because of the risk of suffocation.
Persons with a medical condition, mental health condition, or disability that prevents wearing a mask. This includes persons with a medical condition for whom wearing a mask could obstruct breathing or who are unconscious, incapacitated, or otherwise unable to remove a mask without assistance.
Persons who are hearing impaired, or communicating with a person who is hearing impaired, where the ability to see the mouth is essential for communication.
Persons for whom wearing a mask would create a risk to the person related to their work, as determined by local, state, or federal regulators or workplace safety guidelines.

A number of counties have issued similar Orders in the past few weeks, including many of Mono County's drive market counties such as Los Angeles County. In addition, both the CDC and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) recently recommended that unvaccinated and fully vaccinated individuals wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas of Substantial or High transmission.

The Emergency Operations Center (EOC) team will be hosting a bilingual COVID-19 Community Conversation at 5:30pm this Thursday, August 5 to provide an update on the pandemic in Mono County. Meeting details can be accessed on the COVID-19 Portal.

Mono County residents and visitors are encouraged to visit the California Department of Public Health's My Turn website at myturn.ca.gov to schedule local COVID-19 vaccination appointments, or visit an upcoming Mono County Walk-In Clinic. Mammoth Hospital, Vons, and Rite Aid have all joined in the vaccination effort, and appointments are available via My Turn. In addition to the My Turn website, appointments can be made directly with medical providers and at Mammoth Hospital.",t2_33kr7,biffnix,0,1628016046.0,0,t1_h7l0l84,h7l0l84,True,biffnix,t3_ox6z04,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/ox6z04/mono_county_issues_indoor_mask_order_following/,MONO COUNTY ISSUES INDOOR MASK ORDER FOLLOWING INCREASE IN LOCAL COVID-19 CASES,/r/Bishop/comments/ox6z04/mono_county_issues_indoor_mask_order_following/h7l0l84/,8,r/Bishop,0,8

What...the ever living fuck are you ranting about? Experience is not fact....no shit, who said that? Grouping different elements into a sentence is giving them similar definitions, now? Stop it. I said that you didn't provide either of what I listed, you went on some 12 year old level tirade like the sand in your asshole just won't ever come out all the way. Perhaps a bidet?

Fencing and Jazz actually have a lot to do with one another,  but you let loose a hasty little emotional response because you think you cut off my clever reference. You didn't. Fencing is also not structured, you're talking out your ass. It has rules, but it's all about the improvisation to get a point or the footwork up on your opponent....it isn't bowling...lol. Jazz, you also cannot play ""literally any note"" and it will work, you would make a horrible Jazz musician. There are scales, structures, chord progressions, etc., or do think that shit just fell out of the sky? Don't be a choom.

Now I will tell you how they apply. You basically walked into this one by claiming you know what jazz and fencing consist of, but like Jazz and Fencing, always flowing, always moving, always finding new ways to fit into what is established....if you move too fast because you think that is what it is, you'll fuck it up. You talk and assume without knowing, first, and you fucked up any credibility in this exchange by making an ass of yourself.

You can regale me all you want with your account of this entire situation, but the entire point you're once again missing...you're still responding. Everyone has their methods of perusing what they peruse in life, but my point was you did respond, not that you do respond. Habits aren't up for debate here, lol. You want preferred pronouns? How about ""Sr."" for Professor Prolapse Sr.? You weren't the first.

This isn't like ""hands up don't shoot"". This was multiple instances of nearly inhuman strength and a strong dog being told ""kill him"" while his owner is getting attacked. This is a fucking joke.

Experience is not fact. Ideology is based on your personal feelings. Neither meets the definition of evidence. 

I am familiar with fencing and jazz to the point that I know they have nothing to do with one another. One is a highly structured points based combat sport. The other is a very loosely structured, highly improvisational form of music based on a scale that you can literally play any note of and it will work with the harmony. As far as how they apply here. I believe you think you’re jousting like an Olympian, but in reality you’ve shown up to the jazz sesh before learning how to play your ukulele.

"**DEATH VALLEY, CA** – A California Highway Patrol (CHP) helicopter crew found a deceased hiker about 2 miles from the closest road in Death Valley National Park on July 28. According to family members, the 68-year-old man planned to hike from Badwater to West Side Road and back, a 12-mile round-trip hike across salt flats.

Douglas Branham missed a scheduled flight home to Tukwila, WA on July 27. A family member called The Inn at Death Valley on the morning of July 28 and learned that his belongings were still in his hotel room. National Park Service rangers found his vehicle at Badwater parking lot.

CHP’s H-82 helicopter located his body around 2:25 pm on July 28. Helicopter rotors struggle to create enough lift in hot air, and temperatures were about 115°F at the time. The helicopter landed at Furnace Creek airport to off-load equipment to lighten the helicopter before returning with a park ranger to recover his body.

The Inyo County Coroner Office is investigating the cause of death. Mr. Branham likely started his hike on Sunday or Monday, when temperatures were up to 118°F, with humidity up to 91%.

Park rangers urge summer travelers to visit Death Valley safely by hiking only before 10 am or at high elevations, drinking plenty of water, eating snacks, and by staying close to an air-conditioned building or vehicle to cool down in.

"I honestly don't know what possible solutions there could be. With limited real property available for sale, and little new development, housing is in very short supply, and has been for several years now.

More high density housing could solve a lot of the problems, but none seems to be in development, much less construction, in either Inyo or Mono counties. As remote workers look beyond the 'burbs to live their best life, they are looking to leverage their equity in their current homes to purchase properties in other, often rural, or otherwise attractive areas, and want to dip their feet into that community.  I get it. It's completely logical, and I don't blame *anyone* for wanting to do that.  It's literally why my family chose Bishop over 20 years ago - I loved the area, my wife grew up nearby, and I had the opportunity to do so.  

I *know* it comes off as provincial and self-interested to say things like, ""Don't come here!"" I honestly don't feel that way. But, as I also work in K12 (at the county office of education level), as does my wife, we are seeing a LOT more struggles for our new hires to find any housing at all. People are seriously trying to find property as far away as Benton, just to get anything to live in.  I haven't seen that before, so I wish I knew how to solve it.

It's also not just happening here.  Virtually all attractive areas are seeing surges in urban workers who can now work remotely moving in, and stretching housing supplies and raising home prices.  During the Spring, we drove to Iowa to visit relatives, and virtually every place we visited complained of the same thing.  The folks we visited in Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana (Bozeman in particular!), Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa *all* had similar stories, complaining about non-locals buying up available housing, then trying to rent out part-time to offset their cost, and thus limiting housing for workers.

I mean, you can't fight human nature - who **wouldn't** want to live someplace beautiful, that you can afford, and also work remotely at a job you like?  I have that here, and I think it would be great if everyone also had that!

I hope you can find a situation that works for you, /u/TonightHealthy8666/ .  Bishop is full of friendly, welcoming people, and people of all types can build a wonderful life here.  I love it, and hope others do, too.  I don't want you to feel discouraged or dissuaded from wanting to live here.  I just wish it were easier for everyone to find housing these days.

Thanks so much for your reply. This is all really helpful to better understand the issue which I had heard was concerning but not to this degree that so many workers even  teachers can’t find housing (I’m a teacher myself).

"That’s not what what-about-ism is. It was reduction to the absurd: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum

You made an absolutist claim, that violence by police was NEVER ok, and I refuted it by pointing out that is leads to an absurd conclusion.

Then you invoked the false dilemma fallacy. I don’t need to choose between police arresting people and police being violent. They can do both, and so long as the latter is only when necessary, I can live with that. 

I don’t disagree that beating a person when they could be cuffed is bad, but that’s essentially a straw man, because you can’t prove that’s what happened in this case.

If you watch MMA fighting, you see that sometimes opponents can be locked in static grapples which can appear like one person is in complete control, but it’s actually not the case. They are straining against each other with all their strength, and the other could break out and turn the tables at any moment.  I don’t know if that happened here. I don’t see it in the first video - they never have him in control and aren’t really beating him, but fighting with the dog.

"SUSPECT ARRESTED AFTER USE OF FORCE INCIDENT
 
 
BISHOP, CA, July 25, 2021 – On July 24 shortly after 2:00am Inyo County Sheriff’s Office received a report of a domestic violence restraining order violation at 969 Tu Su Lane.  Upon arrival of the deputies, neither the reporting party nor the suspect could be located.  While looking in the area, the deputies noticed a male subject across the street at the Chevron station, which was closed; the subject was agitated and yelling.  
 
When the first deputy contacted the subject (32 year old Bishop man, George Barlow III) Barlow asked, “Can I kill you too?”  Barlow then charged the deputy with his pit bull closely behind him.  The deputy continually ordered Barlow to stop charging.  When Barlow came within 10 feet, the deputy deployed his Taser.  Due to the heavy clothing Barlow was wearing, the Taser had no effect on Barlow.  Barlow removed his heavy sweater.  
 
The second deputy responded to the Chevron at this point and after Barlow refused to follow commands, he deployed his Taser striking Barlow in the upper abdomen.  This caused Barlow to fall to the ground.  Before the deputies were able to handcuff him, Barlow sat up and removed the Taser darts.  
 
Deputies transitioned to a baton and after striking him, Barlow grabbed the baton and attempted to get it away from the deputy. During the incident, Barlow commanded his dog to attack the deputies.  Both deputies received dog bites before a deputy was able to shoot the dog.  Barlow was pepper sprayed which caused him to release his grasp on the baton and charge at the deputies.
 
Verbal commands were continued to be given to Barlow which he ignored. The Sheriff’s Office deployed its canine which was able to subdue Barlow until an additional officer from the Bishop Police Department arrived and they were able to handcuff Barlow.  Deputies immediately provided medical aid until an ambulance responded to medically clear Barlow before transport.  
 
The Sheriff’s Office has seen and is reviewing the social media video capturing this incident. After a thorough investigation of this incident it will be referred to the District Attorney for review. The public is encouraged to contact the Inyo County Sheriff’s Office at 760-878-0383, option 4 if you have any additional information.",t2_3etp616e,strange-children,0,1627321099.0,0,t1_h6lyncw,h6lyncw,False,strange-children,t3_orh03n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bishop/comments/orh03n/bishop_chevron/,Bishop Chevron,/r/Bishop/comments/orh03n/bishop_chevron/h6lyncw/,3,r/Bishop,0,3
