"TLDR: 4 10's needs to be an option not a change. 

This is dumb. Everything is pro and con. It varies by the job. Some jobs I had hell yeas! 10 hour days were gold, and other types of jobs, the opposite was true. Also, someone can always find a way to ruin it. I would work those 4 10's only to discover ""something"" and we'd have to come in on Friday. And what about your circumstances? A single person can lump all the work together and maximize their time on and time off. What about a parent? Are the schools going to 4 days too? 

Unless the 4 day weeks are ""AN"" ""OPTION"" this is a bad idea. 4 days works for some, not for others. Personally I love the idea if it is an option. Imagine if some workers at the DMV choose to let the place stay open an extra 2 hours on 4 days? I'd love to be able to come after work.

Prices are still going up and (at least in my neck of the woods) inventory is low. I know you will have bucks for days after selling on Oahu, but keep an eye on things to make sure you don‚Äôt get priced out. Yes, prices will probably drop eventually but there‚Äôs no guarantee the location you want will end up within your budget.

"Selling now is genius, Buying now is a fools decision. Prices have gone up $250K+ on desirable condo‚Äôs let alone single family homes going up $500K. 

Meaning let‚Äôs assume $150K of that price increase is PERMANENT and out of that $250K rise, it‚Äôll adjust only $100K.

Meaning housing prices will decrease (a correction) as market‚Äôs cool. It‚Äôll go down by a $100K.

That means you would save money if you rent anything for less than $8333 for a year, or less than $4166 for 2 years.

Seriously. Don‚Äôt he stupid. Sell your house and don‚Äôt buy.

This is a RARE market where renting will save you money. I repeat, shelling out money to a land lord will save you money.

Because the housing and mortgage you acquire now will be pathetically high.

"I moved about 12 years ago from Oahu. I live in Hilo. Great high speed internet, Spectrum. I heard they have Hawaiian Telcom over in Panaewa but it doesn‚Äôt work so well. Close to things but not in the tsunami flood zone. 

My biggest thing - really rural. You have to haul your own trash. That was culture shock at its finest. You can hire private companies though. And no, those are not swimming pools. Some homes have to catch their own water. They are not hooked up to county. 

You need a car, truck, automobile. Things on Hawaii island are far and I personally wouldn‚Äôt use the bus cause it takes forever and a car is just easier.

Amazon Prime is your friend. You can buy almost anything. Do not come with all your stuff. Just buy stuff here on the island. Also, don‚Äôt bring particle board furniture. The humidity in Hilo will kill that in less than a year. 

If you can get central air, do it. Helps with the humidity. You‚Äôll think it‚Äôs cooler and it is but the moisture in the air can mess with you, your electronics, all sorts of stuff. Store your handbags well  so they don‚Äôt mold.

You will also need new doctors and new dentists. Took me 4 years to find a new dentist. I also have Kaiser so I fly routinely for appointments to Oahu. Also, I have congestive heart failure and have had issues getting my medication here to this island on time. 

Hilo town is also a very small town. Everyone knows somebody and rudeness is automatically a no-no. Don‚Äôt drive like your from Honolulu and watch for all the school zones. 

Also, it rains a lot here. Sometimes loud and unnerving and other times soft and sweet. But the amount of moisture and humidity is unnerving. And of course, the coquis. And if you have a yard, little fire ants are the devil. That sting hurts. Definitely want ready for that.

"I moved from Oahu to Big Island (Kona) 4 years ago. My company offered me a job and I had no reason to stay except my friends which are still my good friends regardless.

Pros:
Quieter, I prefer the small town atmosphere.
Bigger, obviously.
More nature, im an avid camper/hiker and you can truly get into a remote area.
Various climates, dry arid, grasslands, forests, jungle, etc.
Variety of housing locations, Kona, Waimea, Captain Cook, Hilo, Keaau, etc. Oahu seemed like one big connected grid.
Calmer atmosphere and people.
No traffic.

Cons: 
Healthcare sucks. There a good doctor's but not enough. Specialist anything is almost non existent.
Nightlife doesn't exist. 
Shopping and stores also are minimal to none.
Beaches are smaller so though there are less people, they are usually packed, unless you know where to go.

"Have you spent much time on the Big Island? If you can swing it I'd try to actually spend some time there before moving. You might find there's stuff about Oahu you didn't know you'd miss. Aside from hanging out with people you know, there's really not much going on. 

Also, healthcare is a *huge* consideration. For example: my mom was medevaced to Oahu when she was pregnant with me, my dad was also medevaced to Oahu when he had a stroke, I was medevaced in 7th grade when I had some random gastrointestinal thing they couldn't figure out. My dad has to do all of his follow up stroke care on Oahu (aside from like physical therapy and stuff). And he just got a urologist on island instead of Oahu for the first time ever. If you do decide to move, get the very best healthcare you can afford.

I second palolo\_lolo too. If you move, consider carefully your quality of life when/if you cannot drive anywhere. A support network isn't nice, it's basically vital as you age. Who will drive you to the doctor's? Fly with you back and forth from Oahu? Hang out with you at home bc you can't drive to see them? Is there someone around who could move in with you or coordinate care eventually (hopefully very very far off in the future). If you don't have that robust of a support network on Oahu it might be six of one, half dozen of the other if you move to the Big Island, but if you do have that support network, I would think very hard about if it's worth it to leave.

Not trying to scare you: I love the Big Island, my parents love the Big Island and even at 75 have no intentions of ever moving to Oahu. But I would really think through the practical concerns carefully.

But if you maybe are planning on moving somewhere else if/when you need to, the Big Island might suit your needs just fine.",t2_zwu4267,FixForb,0,1648966459.0,0,t1_i36zt0j,i36zt0j,True,mullman99,t3_tv0z5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/tv0z5x/selling_our_house_in_honolulu_thinking_of_moving/,"Selling our house in Honolulu, thinking of moving to the Big Island... any thoughts, concerns, etc?",/r/Hawaii/comments/tv0z5x/selling_our_house_in_honolulu_thinking_of_moving/i36zt0j/,41,r/Hawaii,0,41

"4/1/2022 - StarAdvertiser - **30 gallons of water and fuel spill at Red Hill storage facility** \[Full Article Text\] 

  
About 30 gallons of fuel and water spilled from the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility this afternoon during maintenance work at the facility‚Äôs underground storage tanks.  
  
The Navy in a news release said the fuel release took place in the vicinity of tanks 13 and 14 at around noon during the maintenance work to remove water from the tanks, which the state Department of Health said in its own release is an environmental control to avoid corrosion of the tanks. The DOH said the fuel and water mixture release came from a maintenance line connected to Tank 15.  
  
The department‚Äôs preliminary observations are consistent with the 30-gallon release the Navy had reported.  
  
The health department was notified of the spill at around 3 p.m. and said that its on-scene coordinators observed Navy personnel using ‚Äúabsorbent material to recover the fuel and water mixture.‚Äù The Navy said its response teams have finished recovering the spilled mixture.  
  
The DOH said the mixture was recovered in Sump 2 and that fresh staining was observed around it, but the staining appeared to be localized.  
  
‚ÄúDOH responded to the incident immediately after we were notified,‚Äù said Kathleen Ho, Deputy Director of Environmental Health, in a statement. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs event underscores the importance of DOH and other regulatory agencies having oversight of Red Hill activities, especially around defueling and decommissioning the facility.‚Äù  
  
There have been no reports that the spill has affected the Navy‚Äôs water supply.  
  
The health department in March lifted a ‚Äúdo not drink‚Äù advisory for the final areas of the Navy‚Äôs water supply on Oahu, which serves about 93,000 people and for months had been contaminated with petroleum products from the Red Hill storage facility. Residents reported smelling and seeing fuel in the water they were using, and also reported that it had made them sick.  
  
The DOH issued the advisory in November, and since then the Navy, in coordination with a team made up of federal and state representatives, has been flushing and testing the water to make sure it is safe to use again.  
  
The Pentagon in March announced that the Red Hill facility will be closing permanently.

">Then, there is no allotted time frame that they must adhere to.

I mean, it's supposed to be right away since you're out of compliance until the paperwork is returned, hence why when it's a small amount they simply do this 10-15 second task per form right then and there.  Is there some statute detailing the expediency this task is meant to happen, I don't think so and that's not an excuse to say there is zero time frame they need to adhere to.  So if they took a year then fuck me right because nobody planned for this level of negligence at the legislative level.  Or they did because **compliance** means ASAP.

I'm giving you one example because it's something I could actually articulate in a manner that doesn't come off as totally subjective and because it's happening to me right now, I'm able to give you specific details I would otherwise forget in sufficient detail.

&#x200B;

Overall dealing with state and C&C workers you experience at a higher rate a general unhappiness, a general lethargy, a lack of a sense of urgency when urgency is required, an inability to take accountability or even acknowledge accountability when a mistake is made, the desire to .  Did I mention the audible sighs and huffs?  Like you don't experience that in the private sector on a regular basis.  And that's the thing, I have private sector experiences to compare all this to.  I wish I could offer a recording so people could have an un-subjective view of what it's like but in the end I don't need it.  The reason my initial comment here was upvoted is because people have been through this in some form or another.  We've all sat in the lines at the Sat City Hall and seen what it's like when you don't have accountability.  It's in the words not chosen, it's in the body language, it's in those audible huffs that show this person can operate without the filter everyone else in the private sector needs to have.  It's in how they say to someone, ""you need to go there, right there.  I said **there**, did you not hear me?""  Now I've spent at or almost triple digit hours in lines a year at Sat City Hall due to my profession (pre-pandemic before everything being appointments) and so I've heard more crazy shit than most, but that energy is something a lot of people have experienced at some degree that directly contrasts with private sector experiences.

I also have federal employee experiences to compare to as well.  Without my experience I'd put them in the same boat but the federal employees do seem to operate with a sense of obligation in the civil service they are providing and seem to have more care about compliance.

Now let me just say there are people I do deal with that have good attitudes.  Obviously it's not everyone and it never will be.  But yeah, the stereotype exists for a reason man.

Edit:  It's important to note, I'm dealing with C&C and State workers that are designed to interface with the public or private sector.  I can't speak to the DNLR worker that goes and inspects something somewhere or cuts grass.  There's a metric-shit-ton of C&C workers and state workers that I won't experience in a way where I can judge their general work ethic and that's the vast majority.",t2_cebap,ken579,0,1648933087.0,0,t1_i35fc0v,i35fc0v,False,mellofello808,t3_tu7n47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/tu7n47/hawaii_considers_4day_work_weeks_for_state/,Hawaii considers 4-day work weeks for state employees,/r/Hawaii/comments/tu7n47/hawaii_considers_4day_work_weeks_for_state/i35fc0v/,2,r/Hawaii,0,2

"This is a situation where I'm in a type of non-compliance while I'm waiting on the return of those forms, time does matter.

"While keeping it necessarily vague, I have one example I can give currently.  


One regulatory office I have to have forms certified through if I show up with more than 3 or 4 instances of paperwork, they will want me to come back so they can do it on their time schedule.  If they take it, it takes about 30 seconds to process for 2 or 3.  It's involves stamping an acknowledgement of receipt, filling in a few simple fields on the form, and placing a new copy in a file replacing an old copy.  So if they tell me to come back, the amount of time it takes for the paperwork to process really depends on how long I give them.  Currently I'm on about a month for the instance I'm waiting on now.  At some point I'll have to go in and inquire for the final step to happen.  They give me the ol' ""did we call you yet?"" line, I'll say no, and they'll tell me to wait until I get the call.  Then I will get a call in a day's time to pick up.  If a record has a mistake on the field they were responsible for, which happens from time to time, I'll have to submit a new form for certification.  This happens under the ever present I'm unhappy about having to do this tone which can manifest as anything from every inner frustration turning in to an audible expression or an eagerness (the only eagerness present) to find mistakes which don't turn out to be mistakes.  


To give some fair perspective on this office, they probably deal with tons of people who struggle with the regulatory processes.  The ""OCD"" nature you need with some forms is not something everyone has.  As in you can't take what would seem like reasonable shortcuts to person submitting the forms.

"I guess because if you ask for too big a step at a time it‚Äôll have a hard time being accepted. So we have medical marijuana being acceptable in some places and full blown recreational use elsewhere. If states can make their own laws regarding legality why not at least make it a non criminal offense. Taxation really isn‚Äôt a big concern of mine because in my opinion the current system of licensed dispensaries etc ruined and corrupted a cottage industry. You have to have the cash to get your insurance, get your license etc etc. that priced out mom n pop enterprises. Commercialization is where you get issues like companies attempting to sell moldy weed, warehouse fires due to the volume of production and heat from lamps setting stuff on fire. LPG or some volatile solvent explosions.. we did the exact same extractions at home and never had an accident. The amount of product they process and the volume of hazardous materials on site make that a danger. And at least for me, quality really wasn‚Äôt that great. Maybe in Cali, haven‚Äôt tried Colorado, but it put Aunty and uncle who were involved in the cottage industry out of business, priced out of legal production, unless they wanted to be criminals basically all for taxation purposes. Aunty and uncle don‚Äôt sell moldy ass weed, aflatoxin adulterated brownies, or most of what the edibles market has gone into. Food adulteration like trying to process moldy weed into a more acceptable form laced with aflatoxin is a result of commercialization. I haven‚Äôt seen much if any moldy weed on the black market, no one buys that.

"4/1/2022 - HNN - **DOH, Navy investigating after fuel, water mixture leaked from Red Hill maintenance line** \[Full Article Text\]

The state Department of Health and Navy are investigating after about 30 gallons of a fuel and water mixture was released from a maintenance line connected to a tank at the Red Hill fuel storage facility.  
  
The Navy said the release happened during a ‚Äúmaintenance activity‚Äù just after 12 p.m., and said that all leaked liquids were recovered with one of their sumps.  
  
Officials said the release occurred during maintenance work to remove water from the underground storage tanks ‚Äî an environmental control measure to avoid corrosion in the tanks.  
  
DOH said the leak appeared localized, and the Navy said the Red Hill well remains secured.  
  
‚ÄúDOH responded to the incident immediately after we were notified,‚Äù said Kathleen Ho, Deputy Director of Environmental Health. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs event underscores the importance of DOH and other regulatory agencies having oversight of Red Hill activities, especially around defueling and decommissioning the facility.‚Äù

"What‚Äôs the point you‚Äôre trying to make lol? I was born and raised here speak for yourself regarding being compliant. Forcing half baked solutions that aren‚Äôt well thought out and applied with no real goal in mind other than to just push the legislation through is about the stupidest way to accomplish a goal. It‚Äôs easy to dream but housing in Waikiki? Who lives in Waikiki and who can afford it? Who does that benefit? Commercial business space? I don‚Äôt believe Hawaii needs more commercial business properties. They‚Äôre just gonna sit vacant because most businesses aren‚Äôt going to survive their first lease. More space for businesses when you should be doing the most you can with the least square footage. Either way freeing up Waikiki real estate for business and residential development isn‚Äôt something most residents will benefit from. It‚Äôll be out of state businesses and out of state property owners in Waikiki. On top of that I‚Äôm curious how the infrastructure will be updated. Close the streets, now what? Re route all utilities due to foundation work for new buildings? You‚Äôre very optimistic while leaving a lot of unaddressed issues.

"4/1/2022 - HNN -**Navy water monitoring finds unsafe levels of mercury at elementary school sink** \[Full Article text\]

The Navy said it has detected elevated levels of mercury in water samples taken from a sink at Pearl Harbor Kai Elementary.  
  
The initial sample was taken March 16 as part of monitoring linked to the ongoing Red Hill fuel contamination crisis. Officials said the faucet is the likely source of the mercury.  
  
They also said the sink is in an administrative building and not often used by students.  
  
The sample test came in at 3.9 parts per billion of mercury, above the safe level of 2 ppb.  
  
The Navy said the school has secured the sink and replaced the faucet.  
  
Additional water samples are being conducted.

"Housing rental $24k-$26k aren‚Äôt that easy to find. You should budget for $36k just to give yourself option geographically.

Your commute distance will affect gas consumption. Back when I was commuting 40-50 miles a day, gas was roughly $2k a year. Budget for $4k especially with todays prices.

Food cost is significant. Home cook meal budget around $4-$6 per meal. Eating out varies from $10-$20 per meal. I‚Äôd say $10k a year.

Taxes will be a big hit. Being single, top end $100k income will probably land you somewhere in the 20%-25% bracket.

"Funny how you state that I have very little understanding of this while you're completely walking back your argument. You also fail to mention the most basic place to start with legislative history, you don't even know that ""information technology"" is actually not defined by the HRS (I know you didn't even look, so go ahead and search, you won't find it), and you mention a court that is very unlikely to make a decision in this case.

Take it from someone who has actually done this type of research, [has a copy of the HRS at his home](https://imgur.com/yTvIefO), and cited the statute before you, you barely have any idea of what you are talking about.

First, notice that you've gone from a straight ""no"" to ""a term is unclear therefore we ignore the statute"" to ""no one knows what the result will be."" Each of your three posts says something different. I'm glad that you can change your views as I present you with new things to consider.

Second, anyone who has ever done any legislative history knows to begin with the Act.  How you mention ""committee reports"" without mentioning Act shows that you really don't know what you are talking about. I'd honestly be surprised if you even knew how to find the act.

Legislative research begins with the Act because the act gives the bill number ([HB1090](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/Archives/measure_indiv_Archives.aspx?billtype=HB&billnumber=1090&year=2015) in this case) and you need the bill number to find the committee reports, testimony, and previous drafts.  You've also probably never done this, to find testimony before 2008, someone needs to go to the State Archives; back in the day, the box numbers of the documents weren't posted online, [but now they are](https://ags.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hsa_leg_fa.pdf#page=225) and now a little more work can be done at home.

For the numerous other people do know how to find [Act 158, Session Laws of Hawaii 2015](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/slh/Years/SLH2015/SLH2015_Act158.pdf) (notice that the top right corner has the bill number), they would read section 1 and see that ""The purpose of this Act is to stimulate Hawaii's economy **by prohibiting non compete agreements and restrictive covenants that forbid post-employment competition for employees of technology businesses.**""  Any competent attorney would quote that in a motion. The vast majority of *circuit court* judges would construe the term ""information technology development"" liberally in favor of the legislative intent (assuming that would even be an issue)--*contrary* to what you claim.

You also probably don't know this, but committee reports are just what one staffer thinks and what the chair often just signs. They're good to cite, but not nearly as persuasive as the actual words of the session law. You probably don't know this either, and they definitely don't teach this in 1L Legal Research at UH, but the bottom of the Committee Reports have a footer in the lower left corner. Sometimes the footer ends with the -1, -2, or something like that, [like this](https://www.capitol.hawaii.gov/session2022/CommReports/HB2024_HD1_HSCR919-22_.pdf).  That -1 means a draft Committee Report got finished by the drafting agency, sent to the chair, the chair made further edits, and the Committee Report got revised. You can see who really edits their reports by looking at the bottom.

Third, the chances of the Hawaii Supreme Court making a decision on a case like this extraordinarily rare.  Assuming it isn't settled, chances are that the former employee would win on summary judgement at the Circuit Court, because the language in the Act completely eviscerate your argument of ""'information technology development' is unclear so we should just disregard the entire statute."" (Do I need to cite a case saying that Courts disfavor disregarding a statute?) The former employer would then appeal to the Intermediate Court of Appeals (which is their right) and then the losing party (probably) of the appeal would appeal to the Hawaii Supreme Court.  However, you have failed to mention that the Hawaii Supreme Court is very unlikely to grant cert because the Act (which you still have not read), legislative intent, and subsection (a) is clear as day.

"Healthcare worker. I do a lot of tele health calls and part of what we have to do for HIPAA is verification that we are actually talking to the patient/client. DOB and home address are to approved identifiers. However, with that being said, if the person was from HMSA they should have done a better job of validating your skepticism and reassured you in a better manner. I experience this all the time and praise patients for being cautious then walk them through verifying who I am so that I can verify who they are. It can be a pain in the butt especially since telehealth is being used more and more since the start of the pandemic but it‚Äôs important that we as providers do right by our patients. If the caller didn‚Äôt do that then ask them for a call back so you can verify on your own and hang up. 

She claims you have a complex medical condition. If that‚Äôs the case, I would think you‚Äôd have an assigned service coordinator through HMSA already. If you do, contact them directly and ask them about the call. If you‚Äôre unsure if you do, call the number on the back of your insurance card and choose the eligibility or benefits option. Basically you want to speak to a HMSA rep and tell them you want to know if you have an assigned service coordinator. Typically they won‚Äôt give you their direct number but will transfer your call or some insurance providers will give out emails so you can try and ask for that. Email is typically best way to communicate with a SC because it‚Äôs a paper trail and they‚Äôre required to respond within so many days. If you don‚Äôt have a SC you can talk to the rep on the phone and explain your experience and ask them if this was legit. I think it‚Äôs important that you share your experience with HMSA for two reasons. First, if it‚Äôs real, they need to address improving the process of calling members about a service they‚Äôre eligible for. Second, if it‚Äôs a scammer, they need to address it as well whether it‚Äôs sending out notifications to members and alerting public ie news stations, emails, snail mail, etc.

Edit: Someone already commented on this and seemed to be half joking but it seems odd they would call to advertise a costly service. A need would have had to be established ie a recent hospitalization and the treatment team making determination that you needed certain level of care (1147 assessment). Typically the hospital social worker or case worker would have faxed the 1147 along with referral for a service coordinator. You would have been talked to about establishing seeking approval from insurance for these services. Bottom line, stuff like skilled nursing services cost a lot of money and I can‚Äôt imagine HMSA encouraging it‚Äôs members to use a costly service out of the blue.",t2_zdr7b,Veeksvoodoo,0,1648826585.0,0,t1_i2zrusp,i2zrusp,False,pikkopots,t3_ttgcrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/ttgcrl/call_from_hmsa/,"Call from ""Hmsa""",/r/Hawaii/comments/ttgcrl/call_from_hmsa/i2zrusp/,7,r/Hawaii,0,7
"My assessment is that they are either a scam or a really, really, really bad sales agent. If it's the latter this is why. (I work for one of the insurance companies that may call you, which is how I know).

If you're three months from turning 65, plans that offer SNP (Medicare Plan C)or standalone medical plans have agents that can call you in order to see if you may have an interest. This is called a ""cold-call"". This is usually done with people who are on the State Medicaid program, because that's how they get your demographics: MQD sends it to them--to all the QUEST vendors, actually.

If you're nowhere near 65, people who are disabled with serious medical conditions may qualify for any, or all, parts of Medicare, to include Plan C.  These individuals may receive cold-calls as well.

Before, I go into the HIPAA rules governing PHI (Protected Health Information), it's important to know that sales agents aren't suppose to be privy to specific information, such as specific illnesses or provider claims, but they can access to that information. 

My company and HMSA both use QNXT (IDK what it stands for) and anyone with access to it can pull up anyone who is or was a member and see all their demographics, to include their claims. My company's sales agents no longer have level of access, by virtue of being third party (not part of the company) so they don't have access to it, period.  I don't know if HMSA still uses in-house sales agents, but if they did then they could have access to QNXT. At the very least, they could have access to whatever Risk Assessment Score system that they may use. 

Now for HIPAA rules, or specifically the one regarding sharing PHI--even if you're talking directly to the individual, you cannot discuss or disclose PHI (mention any details) unless the conversation/dialogue is directly about medical care or is about obtaining payments for medical services. (The conversation must be relevant to either.)  

A sales agent discussing enrollment into a plan aren't any of these scenarios. But if they are in-house sales agents with key access, then they are idiots. Full stop.

Another possibility is the number you're using once belonged to a previous plan member. Our sales agents run into that issue all the time.",t2_atuma,dxmkna,0,1648826218.0,0,t1_i2zqy1l,i2zqy1l,True,pikkopots,t3_ttgcrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/ttgcrl/call_from_hmsa/,"Call from ""Hmsa""",/r/Hawaii/comments/ttgcrl/call_from_hmsa/i2zqy1l/,3,r/Hawaii,0,3

"For a place with a washer dryer in unit, you‚Äôll probably be looking at an apartment close to 1600-2k a month.

I‚Äôm assuming the office would be somewhere in downtown Honolulu and if that‚Äôs the case, your 15-20 minute bike range will either give you apartments that are really sketchy neighborhood wise or slightly outdated high end. Modesty can be found, but like I said, it‚Äôs tricky. What everyone else said about culture shock is absolutely true, but there is a small contingency of Arabs who are out here. Also, if you are a practicing Jew, there is temple Emanu-El in the Nuuanu area not far from downtown. If you do make it through your interview process to come out here, try renting an Airbnb in a local neighborhood so you‚Äôre away from Waikiki.

"Than you‚Äôll be fine. Get a gym membership at planet fitness. Apartment will probably be on the smaller size and pretty modest to be honest.

If you make a budget and stick to it, you‚Äôll be okay. 

Buying a car though out here might be a struggle. Lots are pretty thin right now and the used market is very seller friendly. But if you have good credit and a lot saved up, you can always get a lease on something economical for a decent price.

"As someone that had a pretty bad infestation in the past, I'll share my findings, and what I did to get rid of them:

1.	First, start by checking your spare tire jack.  Roaches feed on the oil that's used to keep the jack threads lubricated, and the jack is almost always located in an area of the vehicle where conditions are perfect for them to thrive. Be prepared to have to deal with dozens of roaches, though. When I discovered the infestation in my vehicle, there were probably three dozen roaches of different varieties, e.g. banded, German, B-52s.  I doused them in diatomaceous earth, boric acid, and vacuumed them up.  Took the vacuum bag out, sealed it in a trash bag and dumped it.  No idea if it affected the grease on the jack, but I didn't care; I just wanted them gone.
2.	If you don't find any there, but you still suspect your car is infested, try covering your vehicle with a cover and leaving your car in direct sunlight for about 8 hours or so. For optimal results, get a black car cover, or find a way to ensure every square inch of your vehicle is covered in black.  If you know someone that has a shipping container that's in direct sunlight, that could work, too.  Doing this in the summer time is best, but obviously not very practical if you want them gone now.  You want to aim [for around 115-120 degrees Fahrenheit](https://lancaster.unl.edu/pest/roach/roach6eng.pdf) in order to truly eradicate them.  It shouldn't be too hard to achieve these temperatures assuming you can cover your car in black.  Cook those fakas alive.
3.	Get some [Advion pucks](https://www.amazon.com/Syngenta-A20378A-Cockroach-Insecticide-60Count/dp/B004H4EAIS/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?crid=1ZE51IK64MH90&keywords=advion+roach+bait+stations&qid=1648803590&sprefix=advion+roach+%2Caps%2C219&sr=8-3) and throw them under the front seats and in the trunk.  Sure, they might die in your car and their bodies will dessicate and dry out, but to me that's much more preferable than them multiplying.  

Hope this helps.  Good luck!",t2_ckpct,Dus-Sn,0,1648804933.0,0,t1_i2ynp4h,i2ynp4h,True,Mactista,t3_tt3ne5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/tt3ne5/roach_in_car/,Roach in Car,/r/Hawaii/comments/tt3ne5/roach_in_car/i2ynp4h/,1,r/Hawaii,0,1

"The Hawaii Supreme Court recently decided a case limiting the kinds of non-compete clauses that are enforceable here.  The rule is: ‚Äúa restrictive covenant is not reasonable if: ‚Äò(i) it is greater than required for the protection of the person for whose benefit it is imposed; (ii) it imposes undue hardship on the person restricted; or (iii) its benefit to the covenantee is outweighed by injury to the public[.]‚Äô‚Äù  The clause has to be related to a ‚Äúlegitimate purpose,‚Äù which can‚Äôt be solely to reduce market competition.

"My recollection is that the omicron-specific vaccine did not perform significantly better than the usual booster.  

The natural immunization should be something to consider.  Here's an article you might enjoy reading about it, although the author is saying that prior infection plus one shot should equate to ""fully vaccinated""

https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/feb/20/its-time-to-consider-natural-immunity-to-covid-19-as-equal-to-one-shot-of-the-vaccine

It also seems like getting reinfected with BA.2 after getting infected from BA.1 is very rare, although it does happen.  Again - another point in favor of ""natural immunization.""

Note that there's some survivor bias involved - you need to have survived initial COVID to have a chance to catch it again.  

When I'm trying to read the tea leaves, it looks like we're going to experience an uptick soon.  The size of that uptick really remains to be seen though.  And there *probably* isn't a need for restrictions.  Of course, we'll see what happens here - but other places haven't really reimposed restrictions.  (Aside from places that are blowing up like S.

"In my personal experience a non compete agreement is not that out of the ordinary in a service or sales based business. It protects the business from someone leaving and taking all the clients with them. I‚Äôve had to sign one with most tech startups and hardware resellers I‚Äôve worked for in the past. In all cases it was for a specified period of time after departure. Without knowing who does what and what each person brought/brings to the table in both the creation and operation of the business in question the OP is asking about I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really possible to make a fair judgement here. For example if one partner is the face of the operational side of the business and the other guy handles all the financials and logistics, then the behind the scenes party is at a big risk without an agreement that protects them from their partner cutting them out by starting another business and taking all the customers with them.

"I once had one walk on my leg while driving. Almost crashed. It's tough keeping them out because of my kids eating in the car. Cheerios everywhere. But I did nix them using this process:

1. Do a thorough cleaning of the car. Vacuum everything. I found a bunch of baby roaches under a floor mat.

2. Spray some pest control spray that doesn't stain or leave residue. Upholstery in particular can retain a lot pf pesticide so don't use a bug bomb. Only spray pesticides if you can air out the car afterward. Rubbing alcohol can also kill bugs, but be careful about inhaling too much of it.

3. Put down some traps. I use the bait traps instead of sticky traps, because the sticky traps just caught a bunch of their legs instead of the whole roaches. 

4. Park the car in the sun for a few days. The roaches can't survive temperatures over 120F for too long, so this may kill a few, or at least get them to leave the car cabin.

There are different ways to fashion an NCA. One could specify a geographic range, although the internet has basically made this a moot point.

"Firstly, I am not an attorney; I'm just a guy with a business degree. None of this is legal advice.

Typically a non-compete agreement is time limited; six months and one year are reasonable timeframes. The goal of a non-compete agreement is to ensure that a severed employee does not steal customers away from the business, and these times are sufficient to to meet that goal. ""Forever"" is not enforceable.

As for other considerations:

1. What is the organizational structure of the business? Is it an LLC, or is it an informal arrangement? An LLC provides legal protection to the owners; however, there are additional tax considerations. 
2. Is this agreement bilateral? That is to say, does it apply to your boyfriend's business partner equally if he leaves the business?
3. My biggest concern: a non-compete would only go into effect if your boyfriend is no longer employed by the business. However, co-owners only leave a business if they've been bought out. Does this agreement contain instructions on how a buyout would occur and / or as /u/palolo_lolo said, ""how the business would be dissolved and how to handle clients and assets.""",t2_34hrn7k6,SuddenlyCelery,0,1648765903.0,0,t1_i2wqgzc,i2wqgzc,True,Apex_Republix,t3_ttacv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/ttacv6/my_boyfriends_business_partner_wants_him_to_sign/,My boyfriends business partner wants him to sign a non competition agreement.

"1. Hoyhoy traps- if it‚Äôs really bad, replace every morning until you stop seeing roaches. I started with like 6 in the car to get them from all points.
2. Get Advion gel, then be sure to vacuum up any roaches that are dead. Otherwise they are food (gross)
3. Close the air vent so the car isn‚Äôt open to the outside to avoid new roaches coming in. This will make it somewhat undriveable due to the smell of Advion gel, but should be temporary.
4. Learn what German cockroach egg sacks look like. Look for them every morning and remove them. 
5. Evaluate where you park it- parking near/under trees or on grass might be causing more to show up.
6. Obviously no food in the car- and even no water.

"Antagonistic bills aren't necessarily enough to justify removal from chairing the Higher Education Committee, but this does it in spades:
> Kim also had a minor controversy with the university after she questioned then-UH President M.R.C. Greenwood on why her son didn‚Äôt get into the law school.

She never should have even been put on that committee.  But at the legislature, what exactly *are* ethics?

Her legal reasoning for her bills seems awfully shaky.
> By law, the university has autonomy from the Legislature, with the regents having oversight across the 10 campuses. However, a constitutional amendment in the late 1990s allows the Legislature to ‚Äúenact laws of statewide concern.‚Äù

>Kim said lawmakers do have authority over the university when it comes to finances.

>‚ÄúEverything that the university does takes money, including the salaries of all the faculty,‚Äù Kim said. ‚ÄúIt takes taxpayer money, and so when they say they have autonomy, they do not have complete autonomy.‚Äù

""Autonomy"" doesn't mean much when you claim *any* spending is outside of that and ""everything the university does takes money"".  The final straw bill blocked granting tenure to certain faculty, which if anything would cost more money (as those hired without the possibility of tenure would need to be tempted to sign on to a position with less long term stability).

"Over 94% of all motor vehicle accidents are caused by human error. In fact, while the rate of minor crashes is higher for autonomous vehicles, the majority of autonomous vehicular crashes have been caused by humans trying to overthink the on-board computer. Autonomous cars cause, on average, 1 death per 320 million miles traveled (Vox), compared to conventional vehicles that cause 1.25 per 100 million miles driven (NTSB). So while they may not be quite ready to tackle all scenarios, they are much better than we are at avoiding horrific deaths.",t2_9zehy,Smellzlikefish,0,1648747193.0,0,t1_i2veb00,i2veb00,False,Troy_Z_D,t3_trxevt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hawaii/comments/trxevt/helen_moritas_horrifying_proposal_of_the_makai/,"Helen Morita‚Äôs Horrifying Proposal of the Makai Arterial, H-1‚Äôs Companion Freeway",/r/Hawaii/comments/trxevt/helen_moritas_horrifying_proposal_of_the_makai/i2veb00/,1,r/Hawaii,0,1
