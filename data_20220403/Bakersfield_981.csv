"There’s a couple things you could do now. I would reach out to a couple lenders / banks and let them know you’re just starting out but need to get an idea of how the financing side of things work. They will ask you all kinds of questions about your credit  score, income, type of property (single family home vs condo vs RV), and whether it’s something you’ll live in or use as an investment. All of those variables (and more) affect the kind of loan you get and the rate of the loan. Just don’t let them officially run your credit report since that will cause a hard inquiry and lower your score (a bit). A good lender can give you a ballpark idea of what you would qualify for. 

Those lenders tend to follow federal guidelines that say your total monthly debt (car, credit cards, student loans, AND the new mortgage payment) have to be 50% or less of your total monthly income from your job. If you know what your current debt payments are you can basically run the numbers yourself to figure out what your max house payment would be. FYI—they usually include the property tax and home insurance in the 50% number too so don’t forget to add those. 

If you have a lot of debt now you’ll be able to afford more house if you can pay it off before applying for the mortgage. 

Once you get the math side a little formed up you could eventually contact a realtor who would handle the buying / making an offer side of things. 

As far as new / existing, it’s a personal preference. New homes have obvious advantages but some things that might go against them: the backyard will likely be dirt only. The paint the builders use is almost always cheap garbage that you’ll immediately need to redo. Depending on the builder they might prefer fast over high quality and that can be a pain to get things fixed.",t2_aqf9w9fo,bakoryebread,0,1648955410.0,0,t1_i36hhdn,i36hhdn,True,hangsa,t3_tuz0gd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bakersfield/comments/tuz0gd/wanting_to_buy_a_house_within_the_bakersfield/,"Wanting to buy a house within the Bakersfield area in the next couple of years, how to begin my process?",/r/Bakersfield/comments/tuz0gd/wanting_to_buy_a_house_within_the_bakersfield/i36hhdn/,1,r/Bakersfield,0,1

The detective turned out to be a complete waste of time.  He did absolutely nothing.  Did not come by, did not investigate, nothing.  All he did was open a file and police report.

I just want it to be done because the 204 was supposed to be originally intended for that but got dropped for the west side parkway. It looks like a lot of lanes but that’s mainly where all the connections overlap. There are enough lanes where if they want to adapt a rail they can do it in the middle like Pasadena. Right now I think making that connection is the prime thing to show we can complete a project and get more money for other projects/updates. It makes sense but I just don’t want it to be a halfway project.

I wasn't told about this at all. Didn't see it on any of my feeds wasn't anywhere. Maybe that's why they only had 1800 people.

You would think for 1800 people the majority shouldn't have to lose access to the road. I can see cutting it down to one lane but to close the road 5 hours before the first runner would pass through is just ridiculous! I'm not sure if you've worked a marathon or participated in one but I have and after the first 6 miles the people are so spread out you don't need more than a 6 foot lane and 10 at congested spots and possibly close half a street for a hydration station... but to close off as much as they did for 1800 people is ridiculous!

Just moved to Bakersfield 6 months ago from the central coast . Moved over here because of the mortgage prices . I got a 250k home with 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms. That wouldve been 600k over there. We're a family of 3 so it's a decent size. The area we live in is not the nicest but it's very calm and I've never seen any robberies or crimes here in our neighborhood. Cars barely pass by here it's pretty enclosed. The real test would be the summer heat 😬 . Ppl don't die of it often so I don't see a problem.

"If you move here you will have to get used to the weather.   

The summer’s are awe inspiring with their intensity.  
Heat like you’ve never experienced.   
Around mid may it starts to get hot as all get out during the day.   
By mid June the over night tempts stop going below 80 and at that point it’s just hot. ALL. The. Time.  

Then in the Winter around Christmas, it gets freezing cold. But let me explain why the cold we get here is truly awful.  
People in other places can see their cold.  What I mean by that is in other places it snows, or rains more. So people can see why it’s cold, it makes sense and folks accept it.  That’s not the case here.  
It will regularly get below freezing here but never snow, and rarely rain. Because of the high pressure and low humidity, it’s a cold that you can’t see.
An invisible biting cold that sinks into your bones and through your walls. You look around and wonder what it so cold??   
That cold sticks around day after day, until it seems like you’ll never be warm again.  

Until mid February rolls around and winter is suddenly over and it’s spring and everything is beautiful and the sun is shining. The flowers bloom and you go for walks, sit at the park, and enjoy being outside. Then it’s mid may again and it’s time for another 6 months of summer.  

So to recap:   

Mid February to mid May = Spring, beautiful.   
Mid May to mid August = 🎇🔥🎇.  
Mid August to mid October = Regular Summer.   
Mid October to Mid December = Fall, beautiful.     
Mid December to mid February = 🧊🥶🧊.",t2_1xv5083n,RivetingYarn,0,1648191320.0,0,t1_i21bq8z,i21bq8z,True,i_hate_everyone66,t3_tkfcrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bakersfield/comments/tkfcrh/to_anyone_who_moved_here_for_the_cheaper_real/,To anyone who moved here for the cheaper real estate...,/r/Bakersfield/comments/tkfcrh/to_anyone_who_moved_here_for_the_cheaper_real/i21bq8z/,1,r/Bakersfield,0,1

Ignoring that: Yes, I read the article you linked and after consulting and verifying corroborating information from other news outlets, the info you shared is indeed correct (though I'd like to add that Elder still had inconsistencies in his financial disclosure forms as of 13 August 2021, as reported by the LA Times; I'll link that article at the end of this reply).

"Lake Isabella and kernville are known for their outdoor activities like boating, mountain biking, whitewater rafting, and hiking. If you're not an outdoorsy type, then I wouldn't recommend the area outside of a quick day trip.  However, kernville makes for a fun day trip. Shirley Meadows right by Alta sierra has the most accessible hiking in the area though there may be some snow up there that may make trail access difficult. There is also the Cannell and whiskey flat trails which are by town. I wouldn't recommend swimming in lake Isabella due to the water likely being cold.  You could visit the local hot springs in the area which include hobo and miracle hot springs off of the old Kern river road. The food scene in the area is quite good with Ewings, Kern River Brewery and the 178 cafe as personal favorites.

"It gets up to 105 - 113 and pretty much stays there throughout the day, the night time will actually be in the 80's to 90's. AC is an absolute essential, and tons of fans will help save electricity.

Wear very light layers, light colors, and I found a personal fan and a spray bottle with water do wonders if I have to be outside, definitely wear sunscreen, and plan ahead of you have pets that you're leaving if you go on vacation.

"“Some of us worked to purchase affordable housing” and “purchasing a house in a different city than where I work” are two different statements. Kern County is “affordable” because the area has less opportunity for its residents to have a higher earning salary. By taking a salary in a larger income generating area (LA) and buying in a lower economic area, you deprive home ownership from those who don’t have the means to do the same.
