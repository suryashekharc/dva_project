"In Riverview? Not much. You gotta go to Tampa or St Pete for fun stuff. Someone mentioned the FL aquarium which I agree is pretty cool, but doesn't take all that long to go through. If y'all are into theme parks Busch Gardens (and Adventure Island) is generally a lot more fun on weekdays because it isn't crowded and lines are short. There's also the Lowry Park zoo. One thing to do that might actually be closer to you is kayaking/canoeing on the Little Manatee River, they will rent out everything you need. If you're going to the beach I recommend making it an all day thing because it's actually pretty far from Riverview. I recommend either Fort DeSoto Beach or maybe head south and go to Siesta Key, Lido Key, or Anna Maria Island. If you're willing to do a longer day trip there are a bunch of beautiful/fun springs and rivers to float down in Ocala area and even up North of Orlando, just you need to do your research and plan accordingly because there are rules at all of them and a lot of times they get crowded if you aren't early.",t2_6b3u5,tjmille3,0,1649007834.0,0,t1_i38xlwn,i38xlwn,True,M4CK1O,t3_tv7u69,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/tv7u69/were_visiting_my_inlaws_in_riverview_this_week/,"We're visiting my in-laws in Riverview this week and we have 2 kids.

"Weedon is the best kayaking option imo and there are definitely non-tour options. The official rental for the park has never mentioned tours before so not required. Weedon is shallow enough to hop out at several spots and easier to spot dolphins, manatees, etc. You do need to check tides though because it can be impassable during low tide as you go through the beautiful mangrove tunnels.

"I live in Austin now, and will be moving to the area soon. Austins food scene is miles above Tampa & St. Pete. MILES. I have no doubt it's good in Tampa, but Austin is so much better. As for housing costs, if you're looking to rent, if you look further out from the city center (say, South Austin), you'll probably find housing that is on par with Tampa in terms of cost. I'm personally renting a 2 bd 1 bath for $1700 while my cousin and her fiance are renting a 1 bd 1 bath in Largo for the same price. SFHs are MUCH more expensive (Californians flock here in droves, they haven't discovered Tampa/St. Pete yet).

Traffic in both places are bad, but I may give the upper hand to Austin. Population growth has outstripped infrastructure much more than it has in Tampa, or the Bay area in general. If you have to take I-35 during rush hour you simply won't get anywhere quickly. I saw you mention that you want a cooler climate. Austin is not cooler, and is in fact hotter that Tampa. It's also surprisingly humid as well. Not as humid as Tampa, but it's definitely noticeable.

"I am curious, what a source would satisfy what are you looking for?  I mean one could say that the voters are the source, as well as polls, donors, endorsements, etc. Show me a local First Responder union that endorses Desantis's opponent Nikki Fried, I'll wait..... Union's typically favor Democrats and endorse Democrats at the National and State level, however the real pulse of a Union and it's members are the local endorsements.   If no one is endorsed in a race, you can bet its because that Union's members support the Republican, but their Local can't really endorse them due to the fact that their State or National organization has endorsed the opposition. You're going to see Union's moving away from the Democratic Party as the Democrats continue to move away from the middle class and it's values. It started with First Responders. ""Defund the Police"" was not the best move for the Democrats.  Canceling the Keystone Pipeline and attacking the Oil and Gas industry isn't sitting well right now with the Laborers International, I guarantee it.

"I Just moved out of Tampa after 9 months. I moved back to North Carolina 3 weeks ago. I wish someone had of been honest with me about Tampa. The reasons we hated it and moved back after only 9 short months are: overcrowded, the traffic is terrible and the roads aren’t built for it, it would take 45 minutes to go 5 miles. Everyone has moved to Tampa in the last couple of years from states like NY, California and NJ, which has caused the housing market to be so incredibly expensive. Houses that have very little to offer went for $200,000 a couple years ago and are going for half a million now, with no acreage and small square footage, rent is overpriced as well, a 2bed 2bath in a nice neighborhood will run you around $2500, there’s no rent control so housing prices keep going up, but jobs pay extremely low wages in Florida, so it doesn’t keep up with the high costs of living. Florida did not used to be this way, I lived in Florida 12 years ago and it was affordable. Since Covid Florida has changed as the influx in people from locked down states have all moved to the area and are driving out the original Floridians. Also, finding a house for $300,000 is going to be difficult if you wish to live in a desirable area. I know you don’t want to hear about the homeless, but it’s very bad now in tampa. Where I worked we had homeless living behind the business, defecting on the property, leaving needles, etc, you can’t even get gas without a homeless person approaching you. It’s sad because homeless is a real problem in Tampa and getting far worse due to the outrageous housing prices.",t2_8ed1as5h,hbqueenb,0,1648929259.0,0,t1_i35786m,i35786m,True,ABadLocalCommercial,t3_phz6o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/phz6o5/reasons_not_to_move_to_tampa/,Reasons NOT to move to Tampa,/r/tampa/comments/phz6o5/reasons_not_to_move_to_tampa/i35786m/,1,r/tampa,0,1

"If you bought your home with less than 20% down one benefit to selling and moving to a new home is that even though the new home will have gone up in price you can at least make a larger down payment and avoid pissing away money on PMI.   Benefit of keeping existing to rent out and buying another home is that you get to keep the owner occupied interest rate on the first home.  Investment mortgage rates usually run about a point higher.  I bought most of my investment properties pre pandemic so everything has 50% or more equity and I've refinanced all but one of them into 15 yr mortgages.

"Reposting from a month ago:

It depends on the economy. I think eventually it will be suburban ghetto… single use/ disposable area. all of the homes built cheaply on top of eachother in 2005-2009 will need replacement everything. There is very little infrastructure and cheap cheap builds. People like it right now because it’s new and less expensive than tampa but in time, when you have a cheaply built 30 year old home that’s falling apart, it’s less desirable especially with traffic issues.

Homes will be torn down and replaced but it’s so far away from tampa st Pete Clearwater that other areas will become more popular for tear downs. Why would you do a tear down in big bend if you can do a tear down 20 minutes closer in Seffner or East tampa?

Look at the 1980s neighborhoods in north Brandon for examples- no one has had enough money to maintain. Blue collar people, (generalizing) that live paycheck to paycheck do not spend thousands on maintenance every year and it snowballs .

Look at Heather lake in Brandon too it has literally been a poverty stricken mess for the past 20 years.the only good thing about it is it’s close to central Brandon so it will probably be rebuilt.

Cheap homes built for one generation. They have literally been rotting (like Seffner )- people with money left those areas for newer places like valrico riverview lithia etc. The old areas become inhabited with renters and the problems with maintenance compound. Condos may be even worse. Poverty will leave the city and those will live in cheap run down homes.

"Realtor here.

The most important part of selling your home is deciding ""Why am I selling?"".

That makes the subsequent decision making much easier.  Selling just because ""the market is ripe"" only makes sense if it's an investment property or if you have a specific goal in mind.

New addition to the family or need new space?  Obvious decision to sell.

Market at all time high on a rental home you bought 8 years ago?  Can be a no brainer decision if you rather cash out than have that monthly stream of income.

New job in a new city?  Again, the decision making is straight forward.

The problem with simply trying to capitalize on high prices is that you need to change your place / criteria to see a positive benefit.  This is because generally speaking, all home prices increase and decrease at roughly the same rate in an area.

So sure, your home may be up 180%, but so are the other homes you decided not to buy previously.  And the homes that previously were 180% above your home's value when you bought have roughly kept that distance.

So to keep the same payment you need to stay in same class of property, though honestly it will more than likely be significantly higher due to property tax reassessment upon sale.

Upgrading using entire proceeds of sale can be attractive if you want to upgrade but your payment will change accordings.

Downgrading to either a less desirable neighborhood, metro area, or smaller home, or different class (SFH -> Condo) is about the best way to put a huge chunk of money in the bank, but many times that doesn't make sense from a lifestyle standpoint.

The daydream stuff such as selling the house and living in a van or travelling the world for a year or two is all well and good but more than likely a few years down the road the money will be gone and you will be looking for housing and a job somewhere in the country back at square 1.  


You also have additional flexibility such as refinancing or building additions to customize your home to your liking.  Plus as an added bonus your housing costs are relatively fixed in an extremely popular and desirable area.  

If it sounds like I'm trying to talk you out of selling (whaaat?  A Realtor Doing That?) I'm more trying to get you to think about why you are considering selling in the first place.  Once you have that goal or decision in place it makes the rest of the process much, much easier.",t2_16nkgp,GreatThingsTB,0,1648908266.0,0,t1_i33xo1r,i33xo1r,True,SPAtreatment,t3_tu0lnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/tu0lnw/if_you_sold_your_house_this_weekend_where_would/,"If you sold your house this weekend, where would you be looking to move to?",/r/tampa/comments/tu0lnw/if_you_sold_your_house_this_weekend_where_would/i33xo1r/,5,r/tampa,0,5

Pebble Creek is a...mixed bag.  On the one side homes are larger than in the city proper (technically it's in New Tampa).  Main downside is that it's old enough that a lot of homes there are really showing their age, and also the golf course is/was in dire straits and sold off to developers to build more homes.  While you may not care if you don't play golf, that negative maintenance did play in to the surrounding neighborhood.

For sure there are some gems there to be found, and overall I believe prospects are good there now that the golf course is getting sorted out.  NEgative impacts have already been incorporated.

But the main thing is going to be your commute.  That is a pretty long slog through some absolutely terrible traffic.  1 way in and out (Bruce B Downs), 75 backed up for miles some days, Bruce B Downs the same, and then hitting dense urban streets with bumper to bumper and traffic lights everywhere.

Not everyone is cut out for that sort of commute.

Take current riverview and multiply it by 3-5 times the number of people and that's what you can expect.  Hillsborough loves building but does not really like planning or new roads so much.

Other than that new construction has a 30-40 years cycle down to a lowpoint, though it also depends on how strong the HOA is.  Stuff built in 1980s-1990s is currently at its low point, so drive around Bloomingdale and Brandon to get an idea.

While tons of people hate HOAs, the truth is that there is a stark difference between non-existent HOAs and strong HOAs once you get to that age, because most people tend to not want to take steps to improve their home because it costs a lot of money, which tends to develop into a downward spiral.

Depending on your arrival time, I may take 75 to I-4 because of the additional lane and less traffic light time but it is still messy getting to 75 and worse getting to Bearss and 275 since there are fewer lanes once you get to Bearss. 


Pebble Creek is the oldest and now most densely populated master planned community in New Tampa.  It also has two separate HOAs.  The newer, larger one has control of the pool and clubhouse.

To my knowledge, the golf course has yet to be sold, but I know it's been left to basically grow out since it closed last year.

Like their previous president who made something like 500k base salary but has listed additional compensation at around 400k in total.

For example they were GFI outlets routed through the bathroom but the home inspector demanded all external outlets be GFI instead of daisychained.

Part of that was obviously dumb luck, but we did see the potential with what we were reading about the current (at the time) investments in downtown Tampa.

"I lived in Tampa for 16 years and I moved to Austin 6 years ago. I don't plan on moving back.

When I moved in 2016, I was looking for a place that was generally more friendly and liberal, with lots of things to do. One where I can feel like I don't have to worry about being sized up when I walk into a gas station. A place with good food, hiking, biking, live music and less dependency on a car (metro train, and better buses). I can confidently say I found all that.

Austin as whole is a more populace city but much denser. It no where near has the spiral of Tampa. Therefore, you can find an affordable place near the city. I got friends who moved from Palm Harbor just north of me and they don't have to deal with I35. 

After talking with friends back home, I feel like Tampa has grown at such a rate that their rent is being match to what I was paying in rent now.

As for weather, summers are hotter but it doesn't follow you around like in FL. You can be in shade, it legitimately feels better. Winters are worse though, not by a lot, its just generally more gloomy.

"Their boom started around 2013.  Before I bought my house in 2012, I was looking to move there and I found a house in East Nashville for 135k (it was close to my cousin's home), but turned it down so I could live closer to my parents and siblings.  1 year later that same house was on the market for 350k and within a few years, apartments/condos in East Nashville were going for 400k (at that time, you could still get a fixer-upper home in North Manhattan for 450k, just for comparison).  Nashville's housing market has been skyrocketing since then.

Which is fine, because I'm not too keen to live there.  My job keeps me on the road, so where I live isn't too important.  Having a cabin and a workshop in the boonies would be just fine for me, and there are still quite a few affordable chunks of undeveloped land available for purchase in the Tennessee Valley.

And that's the real trick.  These hedge funds are buying up developed properties and homes, but they don't want to touch undeveloped land, yet.  They're not in this for the long haul.  They're playing hot potato with the housing market, again, and this time more directly.
