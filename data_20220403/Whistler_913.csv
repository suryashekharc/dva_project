"Depends on what you're looking for, but there are actually some 'hidden gem' vegan offerings in town.

My biggest recommendation, if you are someone who likes hot chocolates/mochas etc. make sure you ask the server/barista if the chocolate they use, is vegan. This bugs me no end in town, as sometimes we need to skip around to find somewhere for a hot choc for our son. Multiple cafes owned by the same people, will use different chocolate/syrup.

Best Japanese in town, is by far Harajuku, which has already been recommended. Definitely check it out! You can almost throw a dart at their menu, and be guaranteed something really good.

A lot of restaurants now offer beyond/impossible burger options, but just make sure to check what is on the burger. One place was great with their burger...except they made their vegan burger not vegan, by putting it on an egg bun. I have no idea of the logic behind this.

If you're in the village and looking for something a bit 'nicer', definitely Raven Room or, 21 Steps. 21 Steps usually has multiple dessert options, too.

Bred in creekside is good, but strictly go in, get your coffee and/or treat, and get out. Take out only.

Some lesser known options would be Cranked, in Rainbow. They have some decent breakfast and lunch options.

Fix café at Nita lake, also has some really good vegan options, including a meatball sub. Special shout out to their ginger cookie.

Vegan wings at dustys are OK, not a bad option of everyone is considering an apres location in creekside.

Hunter gather has some good options too, and even have a really tasty brunch item as well.

Anytime this question is asked, people will always say ""green moustache"" and yeah, whilst it is vegan, it is perfect for those times you're out and looking for something particularly wholefoods, or raw vegan.

There are some items at purebred that are vegan, but it is somewhat limited, and they often sell out fast. It is worth taking a look, though.

Although they claim to have lots of vegan options at alpine Cafe, I've never once had any success with being able to buy something quick and easy to go. I think it might be OK if you're sitting down for a meal, but not ideal for a grab and go.

Mount Currie coffee on main Street does great coffee, and has a small selection of sandwiches and baked goods, too. 

My current fave Cafe in the village, that has reliable vegan food, great coffee, and it's locally owned, is Moguls. They have a great range of baked goods, sandwiches, wraps, etc etc, so good for a casual lunch to go, or if the weather is good, you can sit outside and people watch.

There is a broad range of options around town, but unless it's a place you can specifically book and order, be prepared to possibly leave empty handed. It's very common for us to want to go somewhere to get something quick to go, or as a treat; and they've already sold out of their vegan options.",t2_26awt0o7,joby_08,0,1648966137.0,0,t1_i36zdbm,i36zdbm,True,Snow4us,t3_ttro5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistler/comments/ttro5x/partner_and_i_are_visiting_for_a_weekend_ski_trip/,Partner and I are visiting for a weekend ski trip.

The pan village does a lovely massage and treatments.

Tbh, I mainly find a quiet spot for lunch and reading.  The garibaldi is good for people watching, try to get a fire pit seat on the balcony.

Dublin is good food for a reasonable price.  For really good value the warehouse is incredible but go just outside of peak times.  You can get a fire side table in the brewery, small menu when we were there last year but cosy.

"Hey, my husband and I are there now. We sound similar. We aren't fancy and fitness isn't our forte just yet. We aren't skiing. 

Some things we have planned over the week - snowmobile, snowshoeing, peak2peak gondola, fishing, shooting, tubing, bobsleigh and a sightseeing tour. Obviously this all adds up price wise but we are on honeymoon.

Food prices are some of the most expensive I've seen and I've travelled a lot. Sooo there's not much to do other than pay it but I will say the restaurants are really nice. We had a fantastic meal at 21 Steps last night, loved the tacos at la cantina and had breakfast at the crepe place (there's only one but I forget the name) which was great. 

I can't advise on hiking really. We were at rainbow park by Alta lake yesterday and whilst we didn't stay long it looked decent for a flat walk (there's no snow there right now). Might be a place to consider.

"The manager won’t likely be able to do anything without criminal charges unfortunately. Hence why I’d recommend speaking to WAVAW. They can give you a lot of helpful advice about how best to find solutions that suit you. 

This would also be an HR issue, not necessarily his manager. HR exists to protect the interests of the business first, and employees second. I would caution that they may not handle your accusations in a positive way. And speaking to anyone (with the exception of crisis support) before the police often makes a conviction less likely down the road. 

I’m a survivor as well. I didn’t speak to the Police as well, and I have regretted it for a decade.  There are so many things I could have done better with proper support.

Also, if this person is a risk of doing this to others, there is a duty to ensure he is charged and properly kept away from the public.

Also, food options on the hill are very limited and expensive. A better option might be to stock up at the grocery store (2 minutes walk from the hotel) and take your own lunch. They even sell premade sandwiches/salads.  You can stash your bag at the Max5 meeting area but check with your instructor in case they plan to cross over to Blackcomb.

"I laughed at this post.

For a supposedly world class resort, they don't do a world class job of things. 

I've been screwed twice on the mountain where I couldn't get to creekside.

So I have to take a taxi back to my car from whistler village? Or a bus (when there's no strike)?  

There should be clearer signage or something.

I'm sure there are thousands of people every month who get screwed like me trying to get back to their car. 

Here's another example of how whistler is not world class.  At peak chair, you never know when it's open in the morning because the lift is running and there are people on it (if I put my bionic lenses on, then maybe I can see they are wearing red).

The board to the left of big red chair doesn't always show the opening and closing. 

They should have a sign at the entrance  of peak chair clearly saying closed that you can see from big red so you are not stuck having to take that route down when you check peak chair.

"1) Good catch. I use the lighter-weight ones as regular clothes as well, but even then, not sure how the quantities got so high. I've cut it down to 2x casual and 2x skiing.

2) Can I say that I feel like I'm experienced yet also fully recognize that there are 5 y/o kids who can rip down the mountain on a single ski better than I can on a pair? 

Truthfully, I guess I'm taking the lessons partially out of fear. I'm rehabbing my knee after a sprain from this past February. Being completely unfamiliar with Whistler's runs/terrain, I figure it wouldn't hurt to have a guide and refine/expand my technique along the way. Partially, I know there's always something to learn. Also, can't complain about shorter lift lines and maybe a small group with whom to chat. But I'm not even sure if lift lines are an issue at Whistler in early/mid-April. 

I could probably just hang on the slopes with people I meet from the hostel, esp. the last 2 days, but that would require me to be social in the evenings, and as a non-smoker/non-drinker the whole apres-ski thing isn't really my cup of tea.

It is spring. So that means the freezing levels become more erratic. They can be below the village or above the peak. March is a bit of a crapshoot in terms of snow but there is always precipitation. Pack and prepare for all potential conditions... reference the freezing levels on any forecast you are looking at. The village is at about 600M and the peak is about 2200M.

As others have said, the lower area of symphony chair has easy, groomed runs that go through trees so it feels like tree riding even though you're on full groomed runs.

"We just got back from Whistler and I’d say you don’t need to worry. As others have noted, you probably will get your own gondola going up the mountain but even if you don’t there’ll be windows open (or you can open them). No one will be bothered if you do. 

The Peak2Peak cars are quite large. They can fit around 20 people into each one. By that time of the season I don’t think there’ll be too many people going on them so you’ll likely have room to spread out, and there’ll be windows to open for fresh air. 

There are LOTS of patios at Whistler for dining. Won’t be hard to find places to chill, enjoy some fresh air, some great views, and some overpriced so-so food. We had lunch at the Dubb Linh Gate and then ended up going the next day for apres and it was not bad either time. We all loved the gooey cheese and pretzels. The nachos were good too - monstrously huge. Cobb Salad was fresh but nothing special. Tacos were fine too. My youngest proclaimed the kids burgers the best burger they ever had. The staff were friendly and kept all their tables happy. No complaints at all. 

We had lunch another day the Garibaldi Lift Co and the service wasn’t great (felt like the staff were all getting ready to finish their ski season and head on to other parts of the world - pretty well checked out), the food was ok but very limited menu, and it was pricier than Dubb Linh.

"Definitely bring a mask for the gondola if you are concerned but by that late in the season it will probably be easy to get a gondola to ride up the mountain all by yourself. Especially if you are in a group of 3 or more people. You'll be wearing gloves for the cold (right?), so keep those on but the gondolas are pretty much 100% touch free.

On the peak to peak Gondola you will probably load with other people. However, the cabins are quite spacious. 

Its mountain policy for (at least some of) the windows to remain open on all Gondolas. The circulation is very good.

It's similar for the on-mountain restaurants. They all have very high ceilings, good circulation and won't feel crammed that time of year. Unless it's raining, you'll probably be able to grab a picnic table outside.

For restaurants in the village, it's hit or miss as far as size + air circulation but there are a fair number of outdoor heated patios. I'm not sure what the staff mask policy will be by then. I'm inclined to think you will still be able to find restaurants where staff are masked.

People are very accepting in Whistler. I wouldn't worry about anyone bothering you about mask wearing. At least no more so than any other place in Canada.

Tip: Make a reservation for the ferry, even if you're not going at a busy time. People with reservations get placed on the top car deck. Being on the top car deck means you're allowed (but aren't required) to stay in your car. If you're on the bottom deck, you must leave your car during the voyage (per transport Canada safety regulations). Having said that, the common areas of the ferries are pretty spacious. There's also some great views.

In short, you'll be fine if you just use your common sense.

"The fundamental issue is usually that people use the term short term “rental” but it isn’t actually a rental under the Residential Tenancy Act (RTA). What AirBnb (and similar like VRBO) is more akin to a license to temporarily occupy a location, this is more like when you get a hotel room.
 
Under the RTA which requires stays of more than 30 days a landlord/tenant relationship is established with certain rights and responsibilities. This includes parties requiring notice to each other if they are ending the tenancy relationship. If the tenancy is happening in a strata residence, establishing a landlord/tenant relationship also involves the tenant having to sign a Form K which binds them to obeying the strata bylaws (and being subject to its enforcement mechanisms like fines).
 
Stratas can and do also place certain restrictions on rentals, minimum rental durations, limit the number of rentals in a complex, prohibit rentals entirely, and so on. They aren’t allowed to screen tenants but they have the ability to set certain limits on rentals. Sounds like your strata says the rentals must be for a minimum of one month for example.
 
But stays through AirBnb aren’t technically rentals (under the meaning as defined by the RTA) they are a business activity where someone pays a fee (usually a nightly or weekly fee) to occupy a room or house or whatever. No tenant/landlord relationship is established. Stratas don’t want these because there is no obligation of the person staying there to be bound to the bylaws. Also this is generally a prohibited activity under a use of property bylaw. Often strata will have something banning you from using your residence as a business (ie sort of like a hotel) instead of renting it out to someone (again, a tenancy as defined under the RTA).
 
An AirBnb resident has none of the obligations and responsibilities to either the landlord or the strata as no tenancy as been established.
 
What I suggest you do is review the strata bylaws very carefully. I don’t think there would be anything in the bylaws prohibiting your friend from using AirBnB to find tenants. But a tenancy needs to be established and is also subject to whatever rental restrictions that particular strata has on the books. However from what I’m reading your friend is trying to still use AirBnB but isn’t establishing a tenancy and is only granting paying people the right to temporarily occupy all or part of their strata lot. There will definitely be bylaws in there that address this. At a minimum there will be a “can’t use the strata lot for a business purpose” which this sort of activity definitely falls under.
 
Hope the above makes it clear. Many people use the term short term rental and AirBnb themselves certainly encourage this. However AirBnb isn’t really a rental like when you rent a residence and become a tenant. AirBnb activity is more like staying in a hotel room. People don’t usually say they are a renter of a hotel room, they generally say they bought/got a hotel room because that’s essentially what was done. You paid a fee and had the right to occupy a room for a set period of time. Checkout by noon!
 
TLDR: Using AirBnb (generally) isn’t renting as defined under the Residential Tenancy Act. It’s short term licensing to occupy a space, more like getting a hotel room. Strata bylaws around RENTING only apply to landlord/tenant relationships. Strata bylaws around business use apply to AirBnb activities.",t2_3vl8cs03,Shroud_of_Turin,0,1647541916.0,0,t1_i11upnz,i11upnz,True,talldark604guy,t3_tg4bry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistler/comments/tg4bry/why_cant_you_rent_out_an_airbnb_long_term/,Why can't you rent out an Airbnb long term?,/r/Whistler/comments/tg4bry/why_cant_you_rent_out_an_airbnb_long_term/i11upnz/,3,r/Whistler,0,3

"What's really driving up rent is the cost (and scarcity of supply) of buying a place in whistler, not so much wages.

Everyone who has bought property in the last 2-4 years is buying at record highs. That means mortgages are bigger, which means overhead is higher, which means to rent your home in whistler, you need to get bigger rent to cover the cost. This is a domino effect.

Most 'landlords' are individuals, with a lot of debt, not mega corporations. I can assure you that your landlord who paid $800K for a 1 or 2br place is not getting filthy rich by charging $4,000/mo when their overhead is around $3k/mo. They are barely breaking even. People who bought their place 10, 20 or 30 years ago, are definitely still out there and taking advantage, but if you're renting from someone who just bought their place, look up the purchase price... you might think they are making a killing but they probably aren't. This is also going to catch up to the short term accommodation and nightly stay marketplace. Like pretty much everywhere else in the world, it's getting more expensive.

I don't know when it's scheduled to be completed but the new housing project by RMOW in Checkamus will help a lot for affordable housing. WHA could also maybe come up with a subsidy program to help landlords cover their costs... for example, maybe they can get a $2k/mo subsidy for someone to rent their place to a local worker and then that $4k rent is only $2k for the renter with said subsidy. Something like this could easily incentivize people who would otherwise not rent their home and leave it vacant most of the year or deter them from doing nightly rentals and instead renting it to a local on a long term or at least seasonal basis.",t2_72fu6z6y,blackbearsmatter,0,1647370074.0,0,t1_i0s7r3r,i0s7r3r,False,Kevsbar123,t3_ted7x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistler/comments/ted7x8/how_do_you_see_the_introduction_of_the_20/,How do you see the introduction of the $20 starting wage for Vail employees effecting the town?,/r/Whistler/comments/ted7x8/how_do_you_see_the_introduction_of_the_20/i0s7r3r/,0,r/Whistler,0,0

"Just going to put it out there that evo’s purchase of the WVS group has hardly had any impact. The original owner, Dave, stepped down and retired from the GM role in Oct 2021. All of the original shop managers are still around, pay and benefits are much better, the stores look a lot better, etc etc. 

Biggest difference is their internal systems such as their demo/rental programs, but aside from the learning curve for employees, that should only help efficiency from a customer’s perspective. George and Barry are still bootfitting, the stores have a big presence and competitive prices during the Turkey sale, they still honor local’s deals and love to hook it up if you give a reason to. 

As for the Journeyman Lodge purchase, I can’t really see why this will negatively affect anything. 

evo isn’t out here trying to become the next retail conglomerate. The owner, Bryce, started evo by buying rentals from WVS at the end of the year and selling them online. He spent many Winters living in Whistler and working for the mountain. The company has no interest in “taking over Whistler” as I’ve heard many say. 

I have no connection with evo anymore, but as both a customer and an ex employee of evo in the states as well as Whistler, I see them as a great company with a ton of positive impact and influence in the industry.

"This is a road Whistler has been down before, most recently back in [2018](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/snow-school-instructors-lead-push-to-unionize-at-whistler-1.4553836) when WB ski/snow  instructors lead the charge. It definitely spurred a conversation at the time about fair wages, working conditions, and injury compensation policies, but I don't remember it going anywhere except for a failed vote. In a town with a constant flow of seasonal workers ebbing in and out, it's difficult to achieve the long-term support that's required for a movement like this, and everyone always seems to forget about it by gaper day. Except, of course, for the back-to-back seasonal or year-round employees who are grossly underpaid, overworked, and not always treated very well.

Before I moved on to greener pastures, I hadn't realized how utterly abysmal Vail Resorts' compensation plan actually is. Even for skilled roles that require a fair amount of training or an apprenticeship, Vail Resorts tends pay 20-30% less than comparable jobs in the area, so unionization initiatives like this are going to be an inevitability. It's a rather shitty strategy IMHO, and WB/ Vail will continue hemorrhaging all of their genuinely talented employees until it starts to collapse from within. I have never worked for a company with a higher employee turnover rate or job vacancies than VR, and nobody ever really seemed to care.

As housing prices and the cost of living continues to rise in Whistler, this problem is only going to get much, much, much worse. Prepare for another winter of closed T-bars and lifts, un-groomed trails, and long lines due to a lack of staff. Unfortunately (or fortunately), Vail can't outsource a grooming or fleet maintenance job to Thailand like what was done with the contact centre.",t2_1uts3baj,mtn-angst,0,1646970504.0,0,t1_i075kch,i075kch,True,HuckleberryThick3411,t3_tbbtvq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistler/comments/tbbtvq/possibly_one_day_strike_friday_11_whistler_vail/,Possibly one day strike Friday 11 Whistler Vail employees?,/r/Whistler/comments/tbbtvq/possibly_one_day_strike_friday_11_whistler_vail/i075kch/,12,r/Whistler,0,12

"I mean, I wouldn't say to plan the entire trip around it, but it would be a notable difference between visiting at different times.

"Early season (May 15 - June 30) or Late Season (Sept 1 - Oct 15). However, these two windows wouldn't allow for access to the top of the world trail off the peak, which is a ""must do"" if you have the option... also, in early May, usually the only zone open is Fitzsimmons. By June 1st usually Garbanzo is also open and that gives you access to most of the park.

I don't think they've released this seasons schedule yet... you might be able to come on the shoulder of that schedule so you can get the best of both worlds... probably better to come later on that end of the spectrum as the opening date for Garbanzo and Peak Zone could get pushed back depending on conditions in the alpine.

Also, this year the creekside zone probably will be closed or limited as they are building a new gondola, so that is still unknown how they will handle that... the gondola will definitely not be operating though this summer in Creekside... maybe you will still be able to go down those trails, but you won't be able to come back up from Creekside... perhaps they will have a shuttle or something back to the village if they open those trails... we will see.",t2_72fu6z6y,blackbearsmatter,0,1646932018.0,0,t1_i04m1v9,i04m1v9,True,craptastic88,t3_tb2qui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whistler/comments/tb2qui/planning_a_trip_to_whistler_bike_park_best_time/,Planning a trip to Whistler Bike Park - Best time to go?,/r/Whistler/comments/tb2qui/planning_a_trip_to_whistler_bike_park_best_time/i04m1v9/,3,r/Whistler,0,3

"You’re fine. There’s a huge difference between what the website says,…… and what actually happens in the really real world. 

I have coffee at YVR with the guys a lot. I’m a limo driver. Just pretend you are in a play and give your lines. You are on “stage” when going through customs. 

The guys frankly say they don’t care, BUT,… if you don’t “go along with the script” they will dig deeper. 
I hate to say this but it’s true: Tell them what they want to hear. And that’s the nasty truth. They know you may not be able to stay at a hotel for an unexpected two weeks, but you have to go along with the “script”. 

Don’t try and be too honest or moral about the situation. This is the exact thing your parents or teachers were talking about when they discussed “good guys finish last”. 

Be a good guy once you are outside the airport. 

Time and place. Go along with the script. Doing the “right thing” in this case will only get you further scrutiny and hassle.

"It all really depends. To give you an idea, you can ski Whistler to the end of may. So the high alpine trails will still have a lot of snow and won't be open to hikers. That being said, there are a lot of lower elevation hikes you could do, especially if you did a day trip down to Squamish (The Chief, for example). Kayaking?

"Hi, I'm sorry this happened to you. 

It's awful to think someone would go for the trouble of stealing a lost property and then selling it online. I can only suggest you insist on calling the hotel and trying to have them investigating where your item might've gone. If you're certain it was left inside your room, as they're able to reach out to the staff that had access to your room after you left. 

If I could, though,  I'd like to share my experience working with guest services in Whistler included for the past 7-8 years: communication between areas is a serious issue, the fact that staff is often changing and things get easily misplaced is a real scenario... I've seen lost property misplaced and not logged in properly, then to be found months and months later in a dark corner inside a maid's room or in a cabinet somewhere. Unfortunately, this happens more often than we think.

On the other hand, whenever something valuable appears (eletronics, jewelry  cash, etc...) Usually, the hotel takes this very seriously and tries to reach the guest in order to send the item back safely. At least judging from my experiences...

I hope you're able to retrieve your item, as hotels will only keep l&f for some time before going away for donation.

"Any unique markings that could differentiate your jacket?  If not, I think you’re SOL. 

If yes, are you local and can meet the seller? 
If not, I think you’re SOL. 

Calling the hotel won’t get you anywhere. If a cleaner did jack it, there is no way to 100% prove it. 

In the future write your name in sharpie somewhere in the jacket. Even inside a pocket?

hopefully this helps.

"Whistler doesn’t reward the meek or faint of heart. 

Whistler can reward ppl taking a chance and having some courage and taking a chance. 

Most long-term ppl I know in town came in the same way. A hope and prayer. (And a willingness to work) 

Sounds like you’re good to go. You can worry when your old. 
You’re young, you’ve got customer service experience and you want to be hear by the sounds of it. That’s all you’ve ever really needed. 

A lot of ppl want it all set out for them, with every detail covered and in place. Whistler doesn’t always accommodate these wishes and thus, the stories of it being hard, stressful, etc. 

Anything really worth doing will always have some risk to it. Most of the woeful tales of caution are written by the risk-adverse ppl that arrive, and they find it scary when they 

-don’t know where they’ll be working. 
- don’t know what kind of pay they’ll have. 
- don’t have an address to provide mom and dad yet. 
- don’t know anyone. 

She does not reward the meek. She can reward risk takers.

"Most on-mountain dining places (Roundhouse, Christine’s, Glacier, etc) will require a time-limited reservation. There is a warming area in the Roundhouse, also time restricted. And you’d need a sightseeing ticket to get up there.

In front off the Fairmont there is a small “unofficial” sliding area and when you want to warm up, you can go into the Fairmont bar (the Mallard Lounge) for a drink / food.

You could go on a village walk-about and spend some time in the library (there’s a children’s area) or hang out at the amazing playground.

Visit the Lil’wat Cultural Centre or the Audain Art Museum. Go to the Meadow Park pool for a few hours.

If it's particularly sunny before or during ur arrival, the South and West facing aspects may have some freeze thaw conditions, even up high.
