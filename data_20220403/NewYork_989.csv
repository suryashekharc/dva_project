"I disagree, NYS is one of the most taxed states in the country. Why have buisinesses flocked to CT/NJ and to the South? If they want business to locate to NYS and Buffalo, they need to lower taxes.

Also, NYS and WNY already spends over 20k per year/student. Throwing $ around had done nothing. We have great universities upstate though, its unfortunate most college educated people move to the South to find jobs. 

Also, if they want to make urban areas more attractive they need to lower crime rates. Shootings are wayyyyy up in Buffalo/Upstate and NYS. Murders are hardly ever solved and most robberies and property crimes aren't even reported. NYS just saw the largest increase in CC permits ever.

"I disagree about the state not being ""business friendly""..... It is hard to say that the state with the largest per-capita GDP in the nation is not business friendly. Over the last 30 years, the US's economy has boomed, but growth has missed much of the country, including upstate. If you look at the places that have received the most economic benefit, most have been high cost areas. As the US economy has shifted away from manufacturing, the promise of cheap labor and low taxes is not what attracts businesses anymore. Businesses want infrastructure and highly skilled workforces. They also want to be located in areas where it is easy to get professionals to want to live. Unfortunately, upstate fails in all of these. The truth is, a new football stadium in the burbs is not going to make Buffalo at all more marketable to business.

"Hahah this is hilarious in a sad way. This was always the plan.

The gop knows gerrymandering will NEVER end in the states. So they let some states they know they will never take over politically (California, New York) and they let them self impose amendments.

Shop around for the right judge, get it blocked in some states. In Ohio they did the trick of delaying the courts, then the judge stated it's too late to change anything even though they stated it was against the state constitution....... they let it go.

In New York, the judge demanded they vote on a majority bipartisan approval and to do it quickly even though that's not stated in the constitution that he can impose his own group to do the re districting.

I love our politics, it's all about getting fucked. Then on to 2024. More fuckery.

"Pros:

-New York's geography is fantastic. While it's mostly associated with New York City and little else, the Adirondacks, Hudson & Mohawk valleys, and acess to to the Great Lakes makes it a beautiful and diverse place to visit upstate.

-NY pizza; it blows my mind that anybody would willingly go to Dominos or the like here!

-The state's history is rich and certainly fascinating. Theres no shortage of museums or interesting locations such as Boldt Castle and Bannerman Island. New York also played a huge role in the Civil War that punctuates its history.

-The Adrondacks are the largest national park in the country. You could easily spend a week hiking and visiting places such as Lakes Placid, Saranac Lake & Lake George (they uh, like their lakes).


Cons:

-New York has some of the worst firearm laws in the country. I had only recently gotten into target shooting last year, and it's very easy to understand why people are so frustrated over them.

-Theres a joke that upstate New York is simply the rest of the state north of NYC. The city is both a blessing and a curse, drawing in tourism, but pretty much drawing also all the attention away from the rest of the state. Its effectively the first thing that comes to peoples minds when you tell them you're from NY.

-New York is home to quite a bit of ""old money"" and is known for its political meddling; the history probably goes back to before even when John D Rockefeller called the state home. Theres been quite a number of accusations of corruption and exploitation- such as the current NYC's mayor's nepotism and taking bribes, the former governor using prison labor to produce sanitizer & generally mishandling covid, as well as the current interim governor now allegedly misallocating funds for a football stadium.

"I'm not against private money being involved, I just really don't like the idea of subsidizing such a huge private business. I mean this owner is a billionaire. He could afford all this by himself, and the profits the stadium will bring in will pay for all the money that he invests. It's really not that much of a risk for him. He just wants a hand out. I don't mind giving handouts to poor people, or mom and pop businesses. I just have a really hard time wrapping my head around welfare for billionaires.

Let's say all the capital for the stadium is put up by this one billionaire. I think it would be be a very rare exception that something doesn't work out and he's unable to make his money back and then he's out the investment of 1.5 billion dollars. Which I think is highly unlikely but just to extend an olive branch, let's say it does happen... and he loses 1.5 billion , at the end of the day he still a billionaire.

He doesn't have to move out of his mansion, he doesn't have to sell any yachts. He still has a life of unspeakable privilege. And that's fine, I'm not going to hate on somebody for being a billionaire. However this person does not need our tax dollars.

"Price's tweet summarized the issue at hand and he also linked to the news article. Its a jumping off point for the discussion, not a primary source. 

Obviously they are not cutting the budget to 0 but lets not minimize the severity of a 19% budget decrease to social services and CPS. ""COVID is over"" is a mediocre excuse. The lower income class is still as economically vulnerable if not more than during peak COVID due to inflation and stagnant wages. These agencies serve their own unique purposes, and compensating with higher spend in other areas doesn't fill the void. 

The budget total is immaterial in this context, its about how the money is being used. Better to have a tax increase that provides genuine value than existing taxes being used toward something stupid.

The old ""we have always done this, therefore it must be good"" argument. There is no evidence that stadiums actually help the local economy. The increased consumer spending canibalizes spending on existing entertainment (theaters, bars etc) so it is not a net increase in entertainment spending. Not to mention the harm of eminent domain on residents in the construction area, and the fact that much of the money brought in doesn't stay in the local economy. Even if there is some economic value, the opportunity cost is ridiculous when looking at the lost value of investments in schools, public transit, emergency services etc. The icing on the cake is that multi-billionaite Bills owner Terry Pegula could easily fund the stadium out of his own pocket and be none the worse for wear.

"So first, I wouldn’t go around quoting notorious dude bro Dan Price from Seattle, whom I generally like but remember he’s good for tweets and getting attention. Facts are not his strong suit. Especially in a 280 character tweet

But did you do your own due diligence? Looking at this he makes it seem like they were getting $800mm and now getting zero.

They are getting $3.5bn from $4.7bn last year. And the reason for these cuts is COVID funding related. There’s also increases in child care and family assistance in the budget so it seems to level out. 

The budget hasn’t even officially passed the legislature, and PS. The stadium Isn’t even a line item in the budget….Which is a record high that shouldn’t show much of an increase to taxpayers bottom line either.

We can debate semantics of a new stadium. But taxpayers funding stadiums have been happening since the beginning of time, and they are ultimately good for local and state economies in the long run - I read years ago for example that the Dodgers and Giants leaving town in the late 50s indirectly led to the NYC economic struggles in the 70s due to loss of local revenues.

Building stadiums means jobs. Stadiums bring in jobs and consumer spending. It’s not all bad. Local
Taxpayers end reaping the benefits too.

But before using Dan Price as a “source,” please do some due diligence. He’s using emotions and not facts to get engagement.

"This is a categorically bad take, it's about the most capatilistic deal ever made - if anyone mad about this had read [the article posted here yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/newyork/comments/tqcvni/taxpayers_face_850m_tab_for_new_bills_stadium_ap) you'd know there are a few points of nuance:

1. The new stadium will be owned by the State and leased to the Bills (earning the state a long term profit - **edit:** see comment below, not a profit within the 30-year agreement, long-term meaning multiple human lifespans - that's what I view as ""long term"" within the context of a State budget)
2. The current stadium's ownership will also be xferred to the State.
3. The County will contribute 250M of the 850M total & more importantly be unburdened from some preexisting deal where the County was covering some of the Bills' annual operating expenses.
4. Afaik this is completely unrelated to family services - idk how state budgets work (b/c I'm not a comptroller) but I highly doubt it was *""Oh we've reached a deal with the Bills that we've been negotiating for months and cannot afford. Where oh where will we find the money? Let's cut social services!""* Seems more like simply poor timing and PR planning that makes it look worse than it is.
5. (Edit) OCFS still has a $3.7B budget proposed - #4 tacitly confirmed [here](https://cnycentral.com/news/local/hochuls-proposed-nys-budget-cuts-children-and-family-services-funding-by-800m):

"Summary:

* State received a long awaited payment of $565 million from the Seneca Nation
* The money came after the Senecas lost their court case and the state froze bank accounts
* In addition the state was withholding discussions on renewing the casino deal with the Senecas until payment was paid in full
* This will reduce state tax payer funding required to finance the stadium from $600 to $172
* The cities of Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Salamanca will also receive their long awaited proceeds as part of the casino deal
* The current deal gives NYS and hosting cities 25% of slot machine revenue

"For living in Buffalo:

**Pros**

* It’s still incredibly affordable compared to the rest of the country. The median rent is $1,000 and the median home is $240,000
* You got access to large museums, trendy walkable neighborhoods, a massive Great Lake, dining, entertainment and nightlife.
* Buffalo is great if you like perfect summers, cozy falls and winter sports (ski slopes are just an hour South)
* Don’t have to worry about crazy politics like other states. Schools are well funded, minimum wage is high, womens and LGBTQ rights are protected, there’s free tuition
* The “new” Buffalo mentality is infectious. So many great individuals and organizations putting in the work to make Buffalo a better place to live. From farmer pirates turning urban blight into urban farms, to artists and musicians reclaiming industrial space, to all the entrepreneurs opening breweries, coffee shops, startups and more.

Seriously, seeing neighborhoods long left for dead see new life and being revived is amazing. So many cool neighborhoods have arisen in just the past few years. Thanks in part to the fact you don’t need to be a millionaire to afford property, all you need is some imagination and some elbow grease.

**Cons**

* There’s still some worn down areas and large stretches of Brown fields. There’s still the lead paint and plumbing issues. These are things that are actively being fixed, but it’s going to take decades to full address these problems.
* While Buffalo has impressive entertainment, dining and nightlife scenes, you won’t find every thing here. There’s a lack of large expensive clubs and there’s notable gaps in certain ethnic food. However, Toronto is just a 2 hour car/train/bus ride away
* Buffalo (or New York State for that matter) isn’t great if you cannot at least tolerate winter. I recommend you move out West or down South.
* Taxes are high. In part due to the low value of real estate, but also because every tiny town insists on having its own police force, road maintenance crews and other services that are also provided by the county too.
* There’s the “old” Buffalo mentality that is self-defeating and cynical to a fault. Often most persuasive in old blue collared neighborhoods and suburbs, these people are skeptical of any good happening in Buffalo. “It can’t be happening here, it’s Buffalo!” Worse is all they do is complain.

This is an oft repeated trope by those who are uninformed and misguided.  Let's take the ""red state subsidized by blue states!""

"* Fixing the MTA as a top priority without even mentioning upstate public transportation administrations.
* Focusing on repealing tax breaks to renovate old buildings, when this has been key to redeveloping a lot of upstate’s aging buildings
* Focusing entirely on affordable housing in NYC with plans that won’t help upstate.

Also marijuana legalization and passing a higher minimum wage were both passed under moderates. Maybe they aren’t as progressive topics as you think. Not to mention it was the legislature that delayed legalization, not the governor.

Hell, Cuomo even made SUNY/CUNY tuition free for most residents.

"Sooo the Buffalo Billion is a mixed of projects including several highly successful ones.

* 43North has not only created Buffalo’s first unicorn startup, but has created over 1,200 local jobs and is CASH POSITIVE. That’s right, a economic program that at one point will be self sufficient. That’s because 43North gets a 5% stake in winning companies. This has actually helped grow Buffalo’s tech scene (might want to look up recent numbers)
* Advanced Manufacturing Institute has already ran out of space and is attracting companies as far as California. They’re also a front runner for a $100 million grant to create a tech hub.
* Workforce Development Center - built in the heart of Buffalo’s impoverished Eastside
* Main Street Grants for small business owners 
* Work training programs at city high schools
* UB’s Genomics Institute has already created 600 spin off jobs

Then you have money going towards infrastructure projects.

Soooo in short, this article didn’t do enough research on the Buffalo Billion and we can learn a lot from it.

Less Tesla type projects and more workforce development, skills training, university partnerships, investments in startups, and grants to small business owners.

The issue is that NYS wasn’t investing money in economic development upstate at all. Investing in things like healthcare and public housing sounds great, but isn’t sustainable without growing jobs that grow the population.

Kind of funny that Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse and Albany are all growing in population again. While I think we need to be smarter with state money on what we invest in, we still need to invest in growing the economy. Otherwise all you get is brain drain and a higher tax burden.",t2_3lku2,Eudaimonics,0,1648144366.0,0,t1_i1yity1,i1yity1,True,ToffeeFever,t3_tmibvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/newyork/comments/tmibvf/the_dirtiest_dozen_new_yorks_worst_economic/,The Dirtiest Dozen: New York’s Worst Economic Development Deals,/r/newyork/comments/tmibvf/the_dirtiest_dozen_new_yorks_worst_economic/i1yity1/,5,r/newyork,0,5

"Stop acting like Mom/pop shops, liquor stores, etc. need to have there interests put ahead of every damn business matter.

If a business cannot evolve, they should fail. Point blank. 

Nothing is stopping liquor stores from offering their own to-go cocktails. They can easily incorporate a bar service into their establishment. Not everyone wants to have a bottle of liquor at home.

2.  And it would hurt the mom and pop wine and liquor stores.

3.  Do you buy food where you buy tires?  Do you buy liquor where you buy school supplies?  Why are separate stores such a problem?

It's really simple.  Buy things where they are sold and stop demanding that every business sell every thing.  There is literally no reason why you can't have cocktail supplies at home, and there equally is no reason why you can't cook at home.  If it takes you two stops to get take-out food and wine, I really don't care.  It's a minor inconvenience and not a human right.

">Also, the basic laws of thermodynamics have something to say about any system that claims to be over 100% efficient.

The term is ""Coefficient of Performance"" or COP.  You are correct that the system cannot actually be 100+% efficient, that's basic thermo.

The 3-400% efficiency numbers are comparing the heating output inside your home to the electricity you're putting into the system, but the electricity isn't the only energy input - you're grabbing that heat from outside and bringing it in.

So it isn't ""1000W of electrical input = 3-4000W heat output"" it's ""moving 3-4000W of heat from outside to inside using 1000W of electrical power"".  


Efficiency drops off at really low temperatures, so you'll want to have some form of backup heating, but the tech has gotten better to the point where you can still get a COP of around 2 or so at 0 degrees F with an air-source heatpump.  Absolute worst case the COP drops to 1 and you effectively have resistive electric heat.

"Again the reason you want to use heat to generate electricity to generate heat is because you can use the electricity to collect more energy. A truck carrying gas to gas stations does not use more gas than they carry in the tanker. Mining equipment used to mine coal does not use more energy than can be extracted from the mine. 

You seem to grasp this as you argue later that that the problem is when temperatures are too low to make it worth it to use a heat pump. While we are not Virginia we are also not Antarctica. Our average high is in the mid 30s and average lows are in the 20s. Will it make sense to use natural gas for the 20 days of the year when it is too cold? Sure. But the great thing about a heat pump system is that it is also an air conditioner. If you are getting an air conditioner why not one that doubles as a heat pump for the average winter day? 

I don’t think every house needs to be converted today. Gas is going to be around for a long time. New construction could still use natural gas, but why not also look into geothermal? That way your heat pump is working in 50 - 60 degree temperatures whether it is -25 or 90. More of an upfront cost but if you have the digging equipment already there for a basement and foundation might as well utilize it.

We burn natural gas to generate electricity. What I'm talking about are days in the negatives. In the scenario I thought you were referencing, heat pumps don't work.

the simplest system that would accomplish the same type of thing is putting a big block of metal in a hot spring for a while then moving it inside your house as a source of heat. the only energy you needed to exert was moving the hunk of hot metal inside your house , but you pretty much just stole a bunch of energy from the spring. thus you ended up with much more usable energy then you put in.

You could have up to $20,000 of debt forgiven if you were a Pell Grant recipient who operated a small business in a disadvantaged community for 3 years. So you had to have a family poor enough to qualify for Pell grants and well-connected/wealthy enough to get money to start a business. Not only that, but you had to make it last for 3 years AND it had to operate in a disadvantaged community. If you were able to keep a business operating for that long, why would you need student loan forgiveness?

">She's too much like Cuomo and hasn't done enough to separate herself from his policies.

I didn't like Cuomo because he's a corrupt raging Narcisist and a sleezebag, his policy overall was Center-Left which is appropriate for a state as large as New York in my opinion. Hochul is not nearly as slimy as Cuomo. That's a net-positive from the jump. It's also very early to really judge her on policy given she's only been in office a few months. 

&#x200B;

>Covid response policies

She's relaxed the majority of the COVID restrictions at this point, are you saying she didn't lift them soon enough?

&#x200B;

>the ""catch and release"" bail reform

This was passed by the legislature YEARS before she assumed the governorship. I'm not sure why you're implying that Hochul owns this policy. She has also [publicly stated](https://www.post-journal.com/news/page-one/2022/02/hochul-addresses-furor-over-bail-reform-law/) that she's collecting data surrounding bail reform to measure its impact on rising crime. This takes a bit of time. Knee-jerk reactions based of ""feelings"" is objectively a bad way to do things.

"I personally break it down like this


NYC Metro Area(anything south of I-84) Newburgh, Middletown, White Plains, NYC and Long Island ect..  The area is one of the most unique places in North America. Its hard to fathom big it actually is, cities like Orlando, Dallas, Philadelphia,Nashville ect feel small in comparison(to me they feel like suburbs with some tall buildings). You'll never be bored there's so much to do it can be overwhelming, I'd recommend research and plan activities ahead of time for sure but I'd also take a day or two just to wander and see what the city brings to you. Best way around the city is the subway, driving is a nightmare and surface transportation is a bitch and expensive. Great food everywhere and rude people everywhere. Long Island has some good food, nice beaches and nice fishing. Fire Island is always a party. As a whole this area is a must to visit in ny imo

Hudson Valley: Poughkeepsie, Kingston, Woodstock, Hudson, Catskill 
Very beautiful area situated between the Hudson River and Catskill mountains. With the exception of Kingston and Poughkeepsie this area feels pseudo rural its odd in a good way. You'll find a lot of art and farms in this area, its great for hiking fishing and hunting if that's your thing. Definitely cool place but I wouldn't necessarily go out of your way to check this area out

Cap District: Albany, Schenectady, Troy, Gloversville, Saratoga, Chatham 
Pound for pound the coolest area in NY. Bunch of museums and historical sites in Albany, you can have a couple of event filled days there and spend very little! Troy and Saratoga are both great walkable cities with a very lively bar and music scene. Saratoga race track is always a party. There's a bunch of things to do outdoors sns brewery in Nassau does live events at the barn during the summer, Saratoga Spa State park and Thacher Park are beautiful. Definitely a must if you're visiting NY for the first time. The cap district is a decently balanced mix of upstate and downstate 


North County: Glens Falls, Plattsburgh, Watertown, Old Forge
If you love Camping, Hunting, Fishing,Hiking and skiing/snowboarding this is a must the Adirondacks are incredibly beautiful and rich with wildlife. Its definitely a cool area but if you're not into the outdoors there's no point of going there. Its vastly empty 

Central New York ""CNY"": St Johnsville, Utica,  Rome,Oneida, Richfield Springs 
Honestly the worst part of the state, this is where ""rust belt syndrome"" picks up its run down. Its a taste of the deep south in NY. Food in this area is pretty good but there's not a lot as far as entertainment, the bar/brewery is decent but its a car centric hell hole with virtually zero public transportation so its hard to enjoy.

You would rather parents of an 8 year old pay money they don't have to a random dealer for their child rather than get free, regulated, dose controlled, readily available forms.

Even your ""full flower profile"" point doesn't make sense. Why does Epidiolex only contain CBD? It's because the other endocannabinoids either have no effect, or a negative effect (this is the minority to be fair) on lowering the seizure threshold. Not even accounting for all the side effects you're now forcing the child experience from the THC and other endocannabinoids. 

Lastly, the dosing for Epidiolex has a narrow theraputic range, especially in children. Inconsistent dosing due to the product being an unregulated, and unmeasured can precipitate seizures by desensitizing the patient (this is why the medication is always tapered up and down like most epilepsy medicine).

Obviously I agree that the actions taken by the FDA in the past are gross and irresponsible. But we live in 2022 not 1930. If they are taking steps to improve medicine and access to these things in a responsible way, then we should support and push for more of it. 


That being said, I'm still laughing at the idea of telling a single mom to grow weed for her infant rather than going to a doctor and pharmacy to get a FREE drug.",t2_5e7w6,lexerlol,0,1646938449.0,0,t1_i052rt2,i052rt2,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tawtap,https://www.reddit.com/r/newyork/comments/tawtap/1st_ny_pot_sales_permits_will_go_to_people_with/,1st NY pot sales permits will go to people with convictions,/r/newyork/comments/tawtap/1st_ny_pot_sales_permits_will_go_to_people_with/i052rt2/,1,r/newyork,0,1
"A handful of studies, vs widespread use, over the course of decades...


You understand isolates are nowhere near as effective as whole flower, or extracts?  Science just learned this, even though terp chasers have know this for decades.

I can go to my dealer and say ""I need some that will relax me, and some other to help with concentration and focus""

Dealer provides exactly that.

So, where, exactly, does the FDA know and talk abouy which strains are beneficial for which uses?

Also, Donabinol is $113 for 60 doses.  It's far more cost effective to just use flower, or edible.  And, has far fewer side effects, because potheads and dealers have figured out THC by itself makes people prone to paranoia.  Epidiolex is 32K/yr.  Just... grow it, and make edibles, or smoke it.  Again, more cost effective, therapuetic treatments can be more closely catered to individual needs, and additional strains (With differing CBD/THC ratios, along with different terp profiles).
