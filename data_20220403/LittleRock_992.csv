"It's touchy.
If you keep them too wet too constantly, they do what's called damping off, and die. 
But at that size, they can dry out and die in a few hours in direct sunlight.
I would say that indirect sunlight or a grow light is probably safest until they get 4+ full leaves, and they like well draining soil, and the surface of the soil needs to be allowed to dry periodically.
The peat pots are prone to cause the damping off, but I usually use those in a seed starter with a clear lid, then when the seedlings sprout, I prop the lid open to let it ventilate some, then when they get leaves, I remove the lid and just don't let them get too dry.

"It’s on the NLR side. You can either go river level down River Rd where the skate park and new bike pump track are as well as the bike/walk path that leads passes Burns Park and connects to Big Dam Bridge. Or you can go to the top side (the part that might technically be called Emerald Park) of the old quarry cliffs. There are 2 areas to park and access by car. The main one is behind Pulaski Tech and the other is in front of the Fort Hood entrance.

I used to love this area before it started getting known and more crowded. Not a fan of the fact that they put the pump track right there in the old quarry since it kind of takes away from the whole “away from everything” feel I got from going there.

"The highways with a lot of semis and people babysitting the passing lane, and backroads where people don’t know or care what a solid line means, yes. But i have also noticed some awful design at highway ramps like where 630 merges, and major intersections like in front of Park Plaza that basically direct a lot of out of town traffic right into the oncoming lane unless they’re really on top of things. Also things that make the right lane very uncomfortable to drive in on surface streets and highways alike.

That design at Markham/University and where Chenal gets off are frankly menaces. Even if you’re a thru driver you have to mentally compute before you hit these points, especially at night. Also, once you hit the hospital district on Markham you start to encounter a lot of very thin right lanes that run up right next to electrical posts! The efforts to keep people from bus access and walkable sidewalks to reduce homeless camps near these services hurts both neighborhood drivers and pedestrians as well as out of towners visiting for hospital care, leisure, or business. 430 construction is also very claustrophobic with side walls on the right side at certain stretches that are terrifying in anything larger than a compact, which many don’t want to drive on insterstates when we share the road with so many big trucks.

"Sorry wasn’t trying to offend. I just meant it’s naive to think certain things *dont* happen just bc ABC doesn’t “allow” it.

They should change how they enforce it. Make ABC state employees do that dirty work. Make them a protected class of worker in a way the penalties R higher to really deter people from fucking with the door enforcement. I guess it has to be a cop?

How do we not even have a mugshot or a BOLO for this piece of garbage??

Too much shit in this State will never change because we’re all complacent with “that’s just the way it is” 

Its all bullshit. Go to Lost40 and get as many cases of beer as you want on Sunday, but NOooo if I’m a gas station owner I can sell exactly zero. And people that own those interests would likely not vote for change! 

ABC should be required to employ people to enforce their own laws. As a bartender you simply can’t see everyone at all times. Pizza Ds has a hydration station with cups you can grab on your own!!

The burden of enforcement should simply
Be on the State and not the individual establishments IMHo. Similar to how nobody gets in trouble for literally anything until the ABC sends in their Narcs.

"You’re being a bit naive if you think it *doesn’t* occasionally work
That way. Staff do look the other way (literally and fig.) 

The Guest isn’t asking for a toGO beer cup. They’re just asking for a cup. Maybe it’s for their nasty dip habit or whatever. 

So “Hypothetically” guest can ask for a TOGO water and then dump it,
Make the switch, and leave while nobody is looking. *Seen it happen* we know the other water glasses were empty and now one isn’t. 

 Only bars have someone watching the door like a hawk. Low-mid range and Fine dining establishments certainly do not.

Guest just asked for
something that you have in the house like a toGO water and you provided it to them(literally doing your job). 

Togo alcohol works just fine in other states and cities like New Orleans where specifically the act of leaving the establishment with alcohol isn’t illegal. A key problem with that here in AR being we have poor walking / public transit / TAXI infrastructure —so you can assume most people are going straight out to their cars.

Just strictly talking about the door law. Not getting into all the other ABC bylaws poor service folks are required to be the ones to enforce.

I stopped and as I did the man shot Charlie. I took cover behind a white crossover at the corner and pulled my firearm I checked and the man was running in my direction. Crouched, I moved towards the front side of the vehicle. I rose from cover but as I did he turned the corner, had his back to me, and was obviously fleeing at that point. I decided not to fire. I  took a few quick steps to put eyes on Charlie but someone was already assisting him so I ran back but the man had jumped in a car (a silver honda or some type of import) and was driving in reverse very quickly away.

While i was there, a lady and her girlfriend were trying to get the manager to address the fact that they’d had her car for a month, the paint was all kinds of janky, and her trunk had been ransacked.  An employee had stolen anything of value from the car.  I asked the other person there if this was a normal occurrence because they all seemed so unfazed by what was happening.  And, I’m not joking, he said, “what are you a cop or something?”  The manager told her “Look, I literally just took over this location, someone comes in here with a story like this everyday, I’m telling my best to fix it”. Then he sent her to the maaco in Sherwood (I think) and told her they’d help her because his employees were unreliable.

"I don’t see dogs as just property, I see them as living beings who deserve a decent quality of life and care. The bare minimum is what is guaranteed to the animal by law, and they doesn’t even seem to be met. I’m also suspicious of these neighbors because they bring the dog in around 9, which is what the law requires for animal control … and is typically not known by many who have not been contacted by animal control. If you call and tell them what you’ve seen, they will send an officer out, especially if there’s been other reports. 

Even if you only called because you were annoyed about barking, I think that the animals genuinely need to be checked on based on your comments. ACO are not police officers and are not typically weaponized- they mostly try to educate people in violation and help the animal. I don’t think you’re being a Karen if you reach out because you’re not weaponizing someone to act in a malicious manner nor is this race related, I presume. No animal should be on a chain outside all day.

"Fixed chain tie-outs are illegal in Little Rock and considered animal cruelty. That, combined with the barking all day and your comment about them being left out in the snow, warrants a call to animal services. These dogs seem neglected and like they have very sad lives.  You can report the owners and an ACO will come out and investigate. If the owners are in violation, they will be given education (if not grievous cruelty) or cited, and the animals could be removed if necessary for their health and safety or they will be given a chance to fix the situation and monitored. It’s a simple, painless procedure that could really help these pups.

"That was me.

Midtown Park Apartments is okay. It fits the parameters you described.

The upside: location. Utilities included. Public transportation within a short walk.

The downside: being an equal opportunity housing site, there's a lot of drug and alcohol abuse in the building, leading to some crazy shit outside. Do not let into your apartment people you don't trust or people you know for a fact are users, because they will absolutely rip you off. To be fair, the management is doing a lot to put a curb on all that.  Also, the laundry room sucks more often than not.

The building was put up in 1959, which means a lot of the utilities are outdated. The heat and cooling system is water fed and air is pumped by a fan. The transition from one to another can get a little uncomfortable in the Spring and the Fall.

So that's the basics. Come by during the week from 9am to 5pm and talk to the manager.

"Well again ESAs aren't allowed in public but they do serve a real useful purpose. Their have been studies that show that animals can help people with anxiety and depression. There in an entire branch of therapy related to this. People have real emotional problems that they are allowed to have special needs. Now ESAs are a very specific type of service type animal that are entirely different when you are talking about public presence. I just want to make clear that ESAs are not a bad thing.

You can however get a service dog for something like PTSD but they are in those cases trained for specific tasks. ESAs are not. I never advocated for untrained dogs in public and I do not like being strawmaned. ESAa are separate classes of service compared to service dogs and should be understood and recognized as such. In cases of service dogs for PTSD and other mental health disabilities they fall under different rules and are allowed in public. 

And as a last little note about the rules, service animals aren't legally required any vests that indicate they are a service animal but a disruptive service animal is not protected under the law and is allowed to be removed. When talking about issues of service animals in public its vital to understand the difference between ESAs and service animals as well as what the law says.",t2_6n5wru4c,genderisalie2020,0,1648532457.0,0,t1_i2j5hpp,i2j5hpp,False,petewhetstone,t3_tqlxnf,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleRock/comments/tqlxnf/leave_your_dog_at_home/,Leave Your Dog At Home.,/r/LittleRock/comments/tqlxnf/leave_your_dog_at_home/i2j5hpp/,9,r/LittleRock,0,9
"Really?  I'm of the older generation -- back in my 20s, 30s, and 40s, I'd laugh myself silly if I saw someone like this, and I think I'm generally a pretty understanding guy.  But that's in a public setting - at home, if for instance all by yourself, I could easily see someone doing that.  Or other reasons as well.  That's great.

**But for the ones in public**, if I walk over and say ""Boo!"" (not that I'd **do** that -- I wouldn't want to be near someone so bloody emotionally *unstable*) -- what would happen?  They'd cry and be upset and their animal would Raven: claw my eyes out?  Elephant: step on me?  Rooster: peck me to death?  Snake: swallow me?

I **know** I'm being very uncaring here -- but I don't get it.  What part of ""support"" is ""emotional"" here, or otherwise?  Unconditional love?  Literal ""Warm Fuzzies""?  Just because you feel you're under attack/stress you're going to hunker down in place, pet your turtle, and ignore the world and take it until the ""horror"" clerk eventually gets bored and walks away?

If you're uncomfortable with a situation, don't get it it.  Or walk away.  Run if necessary.  Scream for help or call the police if you're under attack -- but not if I'm just looking at you or asking for the time. (aside: everyone has phones now-a-days with synced clocks via towers via an NTP time source.  I used to help run that.)

Learn how to handle people you don't know, or walk away.  You'll ""never"" get better closing your eyes and holding your dogs' paws. I really don't get it: if you're that scared, stay at home.  Or learn how to get out.  But I imagine I'm preaching to the choir here -- neither one of us has a support mammal.  You're never going to get better just barely ignoring the situation -- you've got to ""deal"" with it.  Everyone does that, me included.  Otherwise you're just a kid/baby and don't need to be treated as an adult, because you're certainly **not** one.

NOTE: now a service dog (ex: blind people, etc) is a completely  different thing.  They're trained with usually a sign on them -- DON'T PET THEM, they ""don't exist.""

"While I would agree that breeding dogs who do not have a functional job (herding, hunting, etc) is wasteful, the reality is that most people with dogs don't have bred dogs. 

But the lack of funding and support for children and families isn't an individual issue. It's a systemic issue. Many people have dogs rather than children because they're cheaper to care for, not because they would rather have a pet. Many people my age would joyously have children but between stagnating wages, exploding home prices, rising cost of living, the continual decline of public services which are intended to support families... You get the point here. They just can't justify the cost and overall demand of the lifestyle. That's because we've allowed childrearing to become so expensive and demanding that no one wants to do it. 

Beyond that, it's not that we don't have the resources either. The US has a similar tax rate to most other developed nations. The major difference is that we spend a HUGE amount of tax earnings on military expense and we've allowed what should be publically managed services to be private.

"I have seen small children do things that you would never think they are capable of. 

I am very firmly of the opinion that IF someone wants to take their dog somewhere, the dog should be well-controlled and not a nuisance to the people around them. Dogs that run up to random strangers are not ok. Toddlers running around wild are not actually ok either. When I was a nanny for my cousins kids, it was a lot of work to train the babies how to behave in public, and you won’t get them to behave all the time. We got the kids pretty well trained to be good and well behaved in public though. 

Nuisance dogs and toddlers I will agree, should not be making a nuisance. It’s actually a significant kidnapping risk to let small children run wild in stores, and an uncontrollable dog is even more dangerous. I’m definitely a fan of parents using leashes on their children if they need to.

"Emerald Park is my fav. You can park up by Pulaski Tech,  from that side you may have to hop a chain-link fence to get a good spot but it’s still plenty back from the edge and safe. 

The other side has the best views (IMHO) but last I knew the shortest route up was blocked to vehicular traffic. It’s walkable but it’s a long and steep road. 

Top of Rattlesnake Ridge out by Pinnacle is a good spot, Murray Park has some good trees over close to the dog park. 

At Two Rivers after you cross the bridge and take that left you’ll see trails to the right that go down to the water. There’s a path that runs along the water’s edge, I’ve found some quiet spots in there.

"I don't know, but from experience with some of the paths suggested by google maps and waze over the years while driving 5 and 6spd Hondas it got to be barely passable or impassable sometimes. The bar to stop a fx4 f150 with what I consider to be the best all-terrain tires on it is a lot higher, plus the windows in the back go down all the way and it makes my dogs happy.

It's good for pulling broken hondas, 4 wheelers, motorcycles, other pickups, boats, and dirty and/or outsized things that would be harder to clean out of an Accord. I drive the Accord for trips less than 200 miles one way generally that don't involve any of these proscriptions. For someone with less used up joints it can do 650ish miles per tank on long trips but I tap out around 400 a day lest I can't enjoy myself for the rest of the day. The truck will do 100-150 more than that and I can drive it 650+ a day without hurting, and can even wait to refuel until the next day without my fuel pump sucking air or not being fully immersed in fuel. 17.4 gallons in the accord vs 36 in the f150.

Lol someone is upset that they don't have a choice of what to drive every day. Since you're already salty I might as well keep going to delineate the luxobarge features; actively cooled and heated seats with Peltier rigs, a gigantic moonroof, heated bench in the back, a fiberglass topper so stuff doesn't get dusty or wet back there, weathertech floor mats fore and aft, weatherteach seat protector on the bench, plus duluth trading company dogs keeper on top of that to protect the door cards from dogs and keep them from bouncing around too much when people pull out in front of us in addition to keeping them from putting their front legs on the center console to surveil the front seats and obtain petting. See also LED lights for everything except the vanity lights and the license plate lights from the factory, radar cruise control, blind spot monitoring, etc. As you can see it's a nice place to spend a day on the Interstate Highway System or on crappy little private roads. These technologies work together to keep it shiny regardless of how poorly others around it drive to an extent, and to make it easy to exit parking spots in busy lots because it beeps and shows which direction oncoming traffic is coming from. I almost forgot the power folding mirrors and heated mirrors and the 360 degrees camera system. Aftermarket bits include a dual band HAM radio and accessories, the aforementioned fiberglass cap, UVA/UVB repelling tint on all the glass (including the windshield with 90% light transmission), different tires, different fore and aft shocks, and a trailer hitch installed in the class iv receiver that is ideal for impaling aggressively tailgating cars. It's bizarre how angry some people get when a vehicle is following another one at the speed limit with always the same gap because the computer is driving the truck. If everyone had this technology we wouldn't have to widen roads as much and it would take less time to get places in addition to generating fewer accidents. It has lane departure warning and mitigation too but I turn the mitigation off because it too aggressively does it, it's hazardous in the rain and doesn't work unless the lane marking paint is in ideal condition.

My previous redneckmobile averaged about 12 mpg and with a high of a tick over 14 MPG. This one averages 18.8 around town and 19-21 on the highway unless I drive it in rush hour. I WFH so this rarely happens. The car gets 26 running around town sometimes 28 in the Spring and Summer. It gets 29-34 mpg on the highway depending on the speed limit and the weather. When all the lights are timed perfectly via doing 12-17 mph over the posted limit at night sometimes it exceeds 40 mpg doing things like 57 mph down cantrell before they destroyed the interchange for the time being. If you have trouble with math and going from 13-14 mpg to 21 on the highway is a bigger difference than going from 30 something to 40 mpg.",t2_9d8g9yip,Important-Chest4977,0,1648336278.0,0,t1_i2908c5,i2908c5,False,Telekinesis1984,t3_toewbp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleRock/comments/toewbp/does_anyone_know_what_happened_on_i30_earlier/,Does anyone know what happened on I-30 earlier today?

"Arkansas is an at-fault state. If your mom was at fault, the other driver will be able to go after your mom’s insurance to get their car fixed and she is entitled to nothing. For any damage your mom’s insurance doesn’t cover, they can sue your mom to recover the remainder. This includes medical bills. Since this is AR, don’t be surprised if she gets a letter from a personal injury attorney claiming “something something neck pain whiplash something something.”

I imagine it’s up to the police to go after the other driver for no insurance since it is a criminal offense to drive without insurance. The penalty for a first time offense is $50-$250 according to google. I’m not sure how that works, honestly. But if the other driver were at fault, your mom would have to sue the other driver for damages. And generally if that person is driving without insurance, it probably means they are so poor that they are “judgement proof”. 

Driving without insurance is so common in AR that it’s dumb to drive without an “uninsured driver” policy on your own vehicle. I’ve been hit so many times by uninsured drivers, it’s nuts.

Edit: I’m not actually sure if driving without insurance is “criminal”. But there are small fines associated with it.",t2_buyrvi6o,WombleSilver,0,1648329119.0,0,t1_i28ktrb,i28ktrb,True,[deleted],t3_tp3v7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/LittleRock/comments/tp3v7i/need_some_advice_on_recent_road_accident/,Need some advice on recent road accident,/r/LittleRock/comments/tp3v7i/need_some_advice_on_recent_road_accident/i28ktrb/,10,r/LittleRock,0,10
"Your mom doesn't have a car because she did not have comprehensive insurance and caused an accident. Just because the other driver may have sped up and was driving illegally without insurance does not change this.
