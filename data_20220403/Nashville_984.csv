"Obligatory ""we're full"".   

My house in Cheatham was Zillow valued at $200k in 2020 and $618K today, so you can give up on finding something affordable here.

The things that made Cheatham County nice (ie, affordable country living) are quite literally vanishing by the day.  The rate of ""sawing down beautiful century-old forests to build a house with more cut corners than a bowling ball"" is something I've never seen here in my life.

When I started at Vandy, the commute used to be ~35 minutes.   Now it's a shitshow.  There has not been a single workday in the last two weeks where I-24 hasn't been jammed for hours.  Old Clarksville Pike has de facto become a ""third lane"" for I-24.   My nice, safe daily commute now takes almost an hour, and it's sheer terror from the volume of traffic driving on a highway not even remotely built for it.  The state will inevitably have to expand both I-24 and OCP, and it will turn a bad commute even worse.

"There are several beginner levels, and my main complaint is that there wasn’t as much time spent on learning the culture, it was more on drilling vocabulary and practicing grammar. And of course it’s a language class so those elements are very important, but even when we broke into Zoom rooms to practice conversation, it always felt like we needed to hurry and couldn’t “waste” time with questions, discussions, getting to know each other, etc. whereas the other two places I’ve tried were better at incorporating those elements as natural parts of the classes. They all covered roughly the same amount of content, and all required independent practice or else you’d fall behind, but one possible plus was that TLC has a much more sophisticated online software for assigning and assessing homework.

"To be honest I don't really like any of the ramen I've had here. Black Dynasty is the best I've had so far that felt decent, but not entirely authentic. Shokku by the Belcourt was just okay, although I've met a couple people who really like it. Otaku was incredibly bland but I went when they first opened and I've heard it might be better since then, so not sure. Funtime was gross and I did not have a fun time. I think I saw ramen on International Market's menu although I haven't tried it, but that's a solid Thai place at least.

Have not tried it but was recommended:

* Two Ten Jack in East Nashville (by far the most suggested and I still can't believe I haven't been here, although I'm trying not to get my hopes up)
* Brothers Noodle Bar by my friend in Murfreesboro

After I’d lived in Hermitage Ole Hickory Mt J for 15 years I finally decided we would try the fabled Hermitage steakhouse. What a huge disappointment. I think the place may have been cool once but it is basically a Ruby Tuesday’s salad bar and hugely overpriced steaks. My med rare was served well done and without seasoning. My wife’s shrimp were obviously frozen. Go to Outback and you get better quality.

"On March 15th, 2022 at 2am, a old white guy wearing a light colored hat, by himself, entered the Rehoboth Church parking lot in Gallatin with his headlights off and license plate removed in an older model (90's) Chevrolet K1500 single cab pickup truck. The truck has a long bed, no special upgrades, no significant body damage. It's dark in color, probably black or blue but the security camera was in night mode so there's no way to tell for certain. There was a large storage box in the bed. He somehow removed the lock on the trailer and took off with dozens of brand new cub scout shirts, hand made trophies, art and decorations. This on top of thousands of dollars in camping and fishing gear we use for the kids. If you know this truck, this guy or happen to see a 7x10 enclosed trailer that looks like it's had cub scout stickers removed, or it's recently been painted, please DM me. We had some donations to replace some of the camping and fishing gear but the shirts and scout made items are irreplaceable.

"1.  It’s obviously not a real issue because the teachers still do it. The pros/cons of Williamson county teaching MUST already be in their favor. (Or they’d teach in their home county instead). 

2. It harms the Williamson county taxpayer, who funds the schools for their own residents. Obviously funding a family of children’s public schooling is more than $3700 a year, so they are already subsidizing these teachers. 

3. There are some inequities in healthcare. That’s not the current subject. 

4. You can try to make your analogy as absurd as possible, it doesn’t make your point. Maybe the county should subsidize only the out of county folks’ gas since they have to spend more on transportation. 🙄",t2_6hoco3fk,Bondlass,0,1648990884.0,0,t1_i37vter,i37vter,False,HeShootsHeScoresUSuc,t3_tuyfja,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tuyfja/williamson_co_teachers_against_policy_requiring/,Williamson Co. teachers against policy requiring tuition for their kids,/r/nashville/comments/tuyfja/williamson_co_teachers_against_policy_requiring/i37vter/,2,r/nashville,0,2

"Chilis on West End? Really? 

You should try Lauter in Southern Grist East. Emmy Squared better for their burger, but there are better burgers in town. Dino's is a great dive bar burger (and also very cheap).

Arnold's Country Kitchen is an interesting place. Monell's is another experience. I prefer it for breakfast, personally. Loveless is also an experience, but way overrated in my opinion.

As for Thai, you might try the Thai Ni Yom in the L&L Market. Their Thai Basil Chicken, which is their signature, is nice. As you have already tried PennePazze, which I agree is great, perhaps Mangia (esp. if they still do their multi-course meal). 

One of my favorites in town in Rolf & Daughters. Had one of the best trout dishes I have ever had in my life there. 51st Deli is also nice. Their tacos and sandwiches both. Mitchell's in Inglewood is also very nice. 

Chauhan has both authentic Indian and fusion. It is nice and has an interesting vibe. Chaatable is more street foodish, but Mameet Chauhan also has a stake in it. 615CHutney, in Bellevue, may be the only true Southern Indian in the area (not sure) and is very nice.

If you want to try a Peking duck, Tansuo does it with 48 hours notice. It is big enough for 4, so keep that in mind. Also an experience. I have always like Lucky Bamboo for Chinese (Szechuan) and Steam Boys has decent Mandarin.

Awash is interesting. It is Ethiopian, but there are no menus. You get what she is cooking, with the option of meat or no meat. I enjoyed it. 

For Mexican, my favorite is Los Compadres in Franklin, which is in the back of a mercado. I also enjoy Taqueria Azteca off Charlotte for down & dirty type Mexican.

"My point is this. I don't disagree with tipping people, but I know that is a doubled edge sword. The employee gets paid a nice bonus, but the employer sees exactly what that employee is making. I am gonna use Martins BBQ because they are one of the places that does this. 



So a normal lunch with me and my wife costs like 40 bucks there. I tip the guy the lowest option, 10%. The interaction is him taking my order, entering it, and then taking my money. A little later someone totally different will drop my food off at my table, forget the Alabama white sauce, and will never be seen again when I ask for them. But whatever. Say the cashier only gets 3 tips an hour. He made an extra 12 bucks. 



that extra 12 bucks might mean he is one of the highest paid people in the place. What I am worried about is the owner seeing that as well. Then when this guy finds a different job, that $15/h cashiers position turns in to  2..13/h position.

"Historically it’s always been included in the price… bars were cash centric for a long time, a $5 rum and Coke was $5 and that’s it, all taxes included. Made for easy handling. Between bars wanting to increase their profits and the shift toward credit cards even at bars, these establishments realized that unbundling sales tax and liquor by the drink tax allows them to keep the menu price the same while essentially raising prices 24%

All they have to do is print that drinks will have LBD taxed added somewhere on the menu really small and it’s all good. 

But do watch out for this scam. LBD tax does not applied to bottles. If you order a bottle of wine this should not incur the extra 15% tax (although some bars/restaurants have their pos programmed improperly to do so).

"I’ve taken a variety of language classes (not Spanish) at different locations in the past two years, including a Zoom class through TN Language Center (formerly TN Foreign Language Institute), and while it depends on your language learning goals, one thing to keep in mind is that TLC is, by far, one of the most expensive classes you’ll find. It’s focused on college/business learners, especially those preparing to take the formal language exams, and uses textbooks geared toward college learners. My experience was that classes moved very quickly and stayed focused on the curriculum with little time leftover for chit-chat, meet-ups, or cultural activities. Maybe it was just the class or the teacher, but while I learned some content, I didn’t particularly enjoy the time spent in class.

On the other hand, I found a less formal language learning class through Meet-Up which was much cheaper, more fun, and taught me about as much content as the TLC class. So I would recommend you Google around and explore options like [Speak Spanish Nashville](https://speakspanishnashville.com/) — I don’t have any personal experiences with that place but it’s similar to the kinds of lessons I’ve been taking which are more affordable and enjoyable.",t2_3jp9l1c0,setlib,0,1648920915.0,0,t1_i34pnr1,i34pnr1,True,pillowparty,t3_tun2kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tun2kb/tennessee_language_institute_reviews/,Tennessee Language Institute Reviews?,/r/nashville/comments/tun2kb/tennessee_language_institute_reviews/i34pnr1/,7,r/nashville,0,7

"They’ll be more than happy to thoroughly investigate in the event of an alarm, but it’s up to you to ensure that they have access to the building to do it. If they can’t get access, then they will investigate for signs of fire as far as they can from the outside. If there is even the slightest indication of fire, they will force entry. Fortunately, there are almost always obvious exterior indications of even the smallest smoldering fires. It’s unlikely that anything - even a faulty wire - is going to generate enough smoke to trigger an alarm without there being obvious signs of fire. It won’t start and stop, it’ll either be burning or it won’t. In the event of an actual fire, there’ll also be multiple alarms coming from the alarm system (multiple smoke detectors + water flow alarms if you have sprinklers). 

The problem with routinely forcing entry is that there are dozens of false fire alarms in Nashville everyday and multiple a day where the structure is locked and inaccessible. If they forced entry on every one of those, they would cause hundreds of thousands in property damage a year. So, the onus is on property owners if they want to receive the best possible protection in the event of fire alarm. If you own a property that is equipped with a fire alarm, you can register the alarm with NFD and provide them contact information for a key holder. If you don’t want to or can’t come out to unlock the door in the event of alarm or simply want to make things as efficient as possible, you can ask NFD about installing a Knox Box - a small lockbox containing a key that only the fire department can access.",t2_ymjx1,Aspirin_Dispenser,0,1648920362.0,0,t1_i34ocoi,i34ocoi,False,BigBubbaAl,t3_tucpgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/tucpgj/does_anyone_know_the_ownermanager_of_this_building/,Does anyone know the owner/manager of this building?,/r/nashville/comments/tucpgj/does_anyone_know_the_ownermanager_of_this_building/i34ocoi/,2,r/nashville,0,2

"Anyone defending that set as “oh it’s rock and roll” or “oh it’s Conor that’s what you get” needs to grow up. As a fan since I was 14, that was embarrassing and painful to watch. He wasn’t making some heartfelt statement when he talked about the confederate sign and The Ryman, he was completely gone and just rambling. The sentiment behind it, which I agree with, means nothing if you are still drunkenly playing a set there and taking their money, then acting like it’s Nashville’s fault you are pissed. 

This was completely different from his 2014 show. Last night, he almost fell multiple times, he went to the corner of the stage and buried him in the curtains, he forgot lyrics, he was downing three different drinks then threw one when it was empty at the end. the band was embarrassed, Mike Mogis has to play a damn babysitter for most of the show. Plus, going back and listening to the video I took last night, he sounded awful.

But even if that bill did by some miracle make it through the Senate it wouldn't matter. The federal government legalizing weed doesn't mean states have to make it legal. Kind of like how alcohol may be legal but that doesn't mean states and counties don't have the right to ban it. It's very unlikely even if it became federally legal that it would become legal in TN.

"Why is anyone surprised? It's alcohol. Alcohol is one of those things where there's no limit on how much you can spend on a single item. I'm betting you don't bat an eye at restaurants that have $5000 bottles of wine on their menus, so why bat an eye at a $50 double shot? Nobody's forcing you to buy the $50 top shelf drink, you can just get a $10 well drink instead.

Yeah, $50 for a double shot is a lot, but then all bars overcharge on alcohol. For the price you pay for a single beer at a bar you could have bought a six pack at the grocery store. It's how bars work. And this was a hotel bar too, which tend to be even pricier than normal.

Presumably anyone who orders these sorts of drinks isn't budget conscious and has a motive beyond getting drunk.

"Not a weird request at all. A lot of folks who bite their nails try to start with this. It's expensive, but the techs at Poppy and Monroe have always been very kind to me. If you can splurge, it's a serene environment. I usually do it for my birthday or as a one time thing (like needing help kicking my nail biting habit.) They like cash tips. 

Cheaper and lower maintenance - have you tried painting your nails with a no bite top coat? It's a clear top coat that strengthens your nails as they grow in and has an incredibly bitter flavor. Just unbelievably bad. So when you slip up and start to bite you stop immediately because of the taste.

"People say the Rams personally financed Sofi, but even that is an understatement the plot of land was given to them to gentrify the area. Kroenke makes hand over fist renting a plot to the NFL for their productions studios(an incredible conflict of interest but I digress) and he was also given more land which he sold to Steve Ballmer to build the new Clippers arena. Mixed with that and selling or renting land for mixed use, the stadium is pennies.

I assume the Titans will get some sort of stadium assistance fee(I think it’s around 300 million, someone correct me if I’m wrong) and by the time they fleece fans on PSLs for the new stadium, sell naming rights for a couple hundred millions, they will have paid probably nothing.
