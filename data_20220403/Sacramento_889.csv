"> Why is this an issue? Guns aren‚Äôt the issue, it‚Äôs the people who use them. People in Switzerland have guns but they don‚Äôt do the sort of nonsense that happens here.

/u/nakklavaar/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_civilian_guns_per_capita_by_country

You see how Switzerland has 27.6 guns per 100 people? That means that the maximum rate of gun ownership in Switzerland is 27.6%. However, because many gun owners in Switzerland own more than one gun, that means the actual rate of gun ownership in Switzerland is much lower than 27.6%

Now what is the rate of gun ownership in America? There is a significantly higher rate of gun ownership in America than Switzerland. And as would be expected, there is more gun violence in America than Switzerland.

As far as lax gun laws, the gun laws are far laxer in the USA than Switzerland. The gun laws being laxer in America leads to higher rates of gun ownership in America which leads to more gun violence in America.

The good news is we can lower the amount of gun violence in America by lowering the rate of gun ownership in America.",t2_f0py50lz,Late-Night1499,0,1649005593.0,0,t1_i38s3sx,i38s3sx,False,twinboysdad,t3_tvafkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/tvafkm/downtown_shooting_mega_thread/,Downtown Shooting Mega Thread,/r/Sacramento/comments/tvafkm/downtown_shooting_mega_thread/i38s3sx/,1,r/Sacramento,0,1

"I would suggest 23andMe and [Ancestry.com](https://Ancestry.com)'s DNA kits. They are sold on the premise of 'finding relatives and family' and we have had success finding new relatives, reaching out, and starting a relationship. Since your child is so young it may be against their terms but worth looking into at least.

Also, I would suggest maybe formatting your post into a couple of paragraphs instead of a wall of text, an highlight the relevant details for David. After reading it the first time I had to skim it a few times afterwards to find his name and specifics, you should either bold these or visually separate them.

"23andMe... if one of the father's relatives have done it, which considering it can be a distant cousin, the chances are not zero that you will find a match on the paternal side.

Then you start messaging those people with the above details, and see if any say ""Ah, David, yeah, that's my uncle from Sac but he's in Fresno now. Works at Woks of Luck now.""

With Mother's Day coming up 23andMe/Ancestry.com will probably go on sale.

"Do you have a source on that?

Source?

A source. I need a source.

Sorry, I mean I need a source that explicitly states your argument. This is just tangential to the discussion.

No, you can't make inferences and observations from the sources you've gathered. Any additional comments from you MUST be a subset of the information from the sources you've gathered.

You can't make normative statements from empirical evidence.

Do you have a degree in that field?

A college degree? In that field?

Then your arguments are invalid.

No, it doesn't matter how close those data points are correlated. Correlation does not equal causation.

Correlation does not equal causation.

CORRELATION. DOES. NOT. EQUAL. CAUSATION.

"I think a lot of people are looking to forge communities, which is great, but I can't imagine a co-living space being a nice place to live in our current social climate.


Americans have fewer social skills than ever before. Fewer friends. Looser ties with family. We frequently change jobs and move. 


At one point the majority of American adults were members of clubs or civic organizations and a large chunk of those were in leadership positions in at least one group.


It's tempting to just buy our way into a community but the fact is that we lack the social skills and common values necessary to make a co-living space a nice place to be. Not even my parents' generation had the skills.



Just think about how fucking wild people have been lately. Look at how we're driving. We can't even act normal on planes. I don't want to live with these people. I'd rather live on a lonely mountainside.

Yeah I watched the video of that. I guess people can make the case that they are escaping a brutal regime but they aren‚Äôt dealing with anything close to what Ukrainians are dealing with so Ukrainians should get priority. That‚Äôs in the perfect world. In reality they Russians had nowhere to go and the Mexican government didn‚Äôt want them loitering at the border.  Results vary by case. I‚Äôve heard of people that has to try three times to drive through the border until they were finally taking into custody in the US. Each time they had to buy a car because it kept getting seized. So slot of people that come have money and typically do well in the US. A lot of them do construction which we need the labor force with the housing shortage. But then coming also created more housing needs and demands.

"No. Possibly would have considered as a college student, but even back then it would have been a last resort if I had no other options (always had options to rent with friends). This idea works a lot better in expensive areas like the Bay where options are limited. And even there the rents for such places are typically a lot less than 80% of the cost of a studio. So your price point may be problematic.

While Sacramento is getting expensive, the discount factor you offer is significantly worse than one can find to just rent a room. Your competition is not studio apartments, but room rentals. You can get away with a slight premium over room rentals for the ancillary services offered. However, pricing based on studio costs will make little sense.

TLDR: May have considered as a college student if your price point was a bit higher than room rentals. Would never consider this in a situation where a studio apartment is affordable.
