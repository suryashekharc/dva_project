"On the contrary, that is what I’m saying. 

So you got the ~$780M in the development agreement covered by FCs tax payments until 2047.

Then you have the roughly $1B in costs from the I-94 north south expansion, which was actually a scheduled WISDoT project but was mothballed for over a decade due to republican funding disagreements (gas tax vs toll roads). It was funded from normal WISDoT appropriations and a $250M federal grant. You certainly can attribute this to the FC project, but I think pinning the whole cost/benefit of the 94 N/S expansion on the FC project is disingenuous. 

Then you have $400M in the local development roads: state roads STH 20 and 11,  County roads KR and H, and Village roads Braun rd, international, and the newly created Wisconn Valley Way. 
Those were paid through WISDoTs normal appropriations for the area. 

As a matter of fact, the Village tax rate is LOWER now than in 2017. Assessments are generally up, but real estate values are up everywhere. 
All this, the the village has been able to fund several full time police officers, firefighters, and administrative staff out of the TIDs expense and not impact the Villages general fund at all. 

Now I don’t wanna make this sound like I’m some kinda fanboy or whatever, I certainly no fan of Scott Walker’s and the amount of created jobs and actual manufacturing has been nonexistent…

But as you analyze the depths of the deal and it’s securities to protect at least the local governments, you can see it’s not exactly a big risky endeavor.

"This is good data. I don't understand where anyone gets this idea that there will be any bubble pop - like the biggest forces on real estate market now are inventory (which is barely ticking up like it needed to and was pretty stagnant since 2008) and mortgage rates jumped over the last several months under pressure to cool the economy. I feel bad for anyone who couldn't get in on the historic low rates when I got my first home 6 months ago, home prices don't really go down (except 2008, which was a black swan of circumstance) so anyone buying today is paying 10s of thousands more over the cost of a loan.

">  I don't know exactly how it works, but your static electricity can cause a spark and cause an explosion if the conditions are right.

When getting in  and out of your car in a big and fluffy winter jacket, you build up an electric charge ([static electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_electricity)!) in your body.  If you touch close enough to the gas filler opening, there will be a spark between you and the car/pump.  Since gas vapors are the flammable part...sparky sparky no likely.

"I think this is an attempt to slide people into opposing LGBT sexuality in schools.  You start by dropping this insane stuff about furries that any reasonable person would object to, and then get people (dumb enough to fall for it) saying “this has to stop!”  Once they start saying that, you append “and LGBT” to the end of the message.  You get young people used to dehumanizing and bashing furries, and then slide “and gays” in at the end.  It’s an attempt to get people angrily and loudly bashing an alternative lifestyle to desensitize then to bashing groups of people openly.  You look like you have a large block of concerned citizens against “accommodation” of non-straights.

"Green Bay resident here.

The person who bought a modest 1950's single-level 1700 sq. ft. duplex across the street from us four years ago just listed the whole thing for sale $110,000 OVER what they paid in 2018. Let me say that again: They think they should get $110,000 profit for four years of house-sitting. And no, it was not a fixer-upper that got a total renovation. Even the current tax assessment is still BELOW what they paid four years ago.

You can't blame them for trying to take advantage of the current market, and frankly if people are willing to pay those prices you'd be stupid NOT to take the money. So it will be interesting to see how this turns out for them.

"Foxconn is still way deep in the hole, actually. 

They never got any incentives from the first WEDC contract, and they had to renegotiate to the new one under Evers. Under that one they got ~$22M for it. (The max lifetime under that deal is $80M)

Also by accepting the new state deal, that voided their local incentives, which were worth potentially $100M over 10 years.

Comparatively they’ve spent:
$60M on land acquisition 
$11M on taxes
$22M on special assessments
God knows what constructing the buildings

And next year begins the Min assessment of $1.4B to the tune of $25M in taxes per year.

I’m sure if you were to look at it from a fresh perspective with access to Foxconn’s spending, you’d probably see they got the short end of the stick, especially since (because?) they’re not making much.",t2_hff2fl82,Bourbon_Planner,0,1648924869.0,0,t1_i34yeni,i34yeni,False,zsreport,t3_tukxse,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisconsin/comments/tukxse/wisconsins_foxconn_debacle_is_the_definitive/,Wisconsin's Foxconn Debacle Is the Definitive Example of a 'Business-Friendly Environment' Gone Wrong,/r/wisconsin/comments/tukxse/wisconsins_foxconn_debacle_is_the_definitive/i34yeni/,11,r/wisconsin,0,11

"Democrats aren't great either,  but their weaknesses aren't blind obedience or stupidity.  They have other weaknesses,, like trying to be so inclusive that there's no cogent platform.  Hillary lost because liberals split their votes...Republicans followed their Fox News marching orders, but Democrats insisted on thinking for themselves and many didn't like Hillary.  I'm one of them.  Your portrayal of Democrats as worshipping Hillary is false.  We liked Bernie almost as much.

There's a reason the more educated you are the more likely you are to be Democrat.  So liberals wind up being disorganized, and insist on thinking for themselves.  Something Repubs don't do.

As for your right wing talking points about Biden...Trump was Putin's little bitch his entire presidency and wanted the US out of NATO on Putin's orders.  He thought he could push Zelensky around by trying to tie Ukraine with Biden corruption, but there was nothing there..  When Biden won, Putin decided to invade anyways.

I hate that all this started. IIRC, it all started as maybe a meme? that got out of hand in some Michigan school district, then it spread around like wildfire.

"Hahaha

One day you are going to wake up and realize that all the divesting from education/infrastructure, degradation of your voting rights and gerrymandering hurt you as well.

But by then every high income and educated person will have moved out of your community. And the general population will be even less intelligent because of bad education. So even if you wanted to change, the dumb kids you propagated will say “What are you gonna do cry on us” as you struggle to understand why someone would want their own drinking water still contaminated to “own the libs”.

And even if republicans all at once realized that cutting off their nose to spite their face is a bad idea, all the tax dollars have moved on to not shitty places. So they have no choice but to beg for federal funding for infrastructure and rely on taking taxes paid from high income more liberal communities. Freeloading today, freeloading tomorrow, all while shitting on educated high income liberals. Just like today.

Someday, 10 years from now as you ask yourself how your township doesn’t have high-speed internet or is still using lead pipes, you might remember me saying this and you will undoubtedly blame someone else…but I hope not.
