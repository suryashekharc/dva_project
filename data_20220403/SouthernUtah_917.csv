"> People are concerned because it's a relevant topic now. That's what happens when a topic becomes relevant. Has anything I have said been false? I feel I have been fairly reasonable and respectful, so why are you so disgusted by me?

No, telling me you want to check whether my 12 year old has a dick because shes kind of masculine and good at sports is not ""respectful."". These are children playing children's sports.  The dignity of their humanity is worth more than the competitive playing filed, particularly since **this has literally never happened in Utah.**. This is a solution in search of a problem.

  It's true this is an interesting ethical question, right, but nobody is asking questions.  Nobody is curious.  Nobody is thinking.  Nobody is studying. They have an answer given to them by their political leaders and they are aggressively, forcefully pushing it down other people's throats as a matter of cultural dominance.

What you are talking about isn't happening.  The odds that a child is both an elite eathlwte and trans is vanishingly low, it just doesn't happen that often. 

They are using the power of the state to attack other people because they are offended by something they saw on Fox News.  That's literally what is happening, right?The group pushing this policy is an anti-LGBT group, not a sports group.  It is transparently obviously what is happening to anybody with two brain cells to rub together.

You can't get around basic biology. Even if someone does the surgery to change their gender, that doesn't change the years of extra testosterone leading to an increased muscle mass, giving them an unfair advantage. Women's leagues were create to create an even playing field. Men are, in general, more athletic than women. That is just a fact of life.

You will run into people who open carry and don't care what you think about it.  Hiking and that -- be very very careful.  Many area's don't have cell phone service, and if you do run into trouble, help can be hours away.

"S. Utah is remote and rural.  There's more infrastructure here relative to the population than there should be because of the tourists but look at the populations of the towns you are driving through and set expectations appropriately.

 IDK where you're coming from, but that's a lot of ground to cover in ten days, so you'll be on the road a lot.  You're also in the tourist off season so stuff will be closed unexpectedly and people won't be staffed up, a lot of the places you likely want to visit are seasonal and the workers move on in winter time.   Don't expect much and stick to the developed areas on the days you need connectivity and you should be fine.

Also prepare for hazardous winter conditions.

"If you are planning on using your phone as a hot spot and are on or sticking to major highways it will ok-ish depending on your carry. There are significant patches that service will not be available even for phone calls. Towns where service is decent can be hours apart if you are planning on the scenic routes particularly through Monument Valley. Some of these remote parts are impoverished so high speed internet and wifi at restaurants aren't really a thing. Towns like Moab you will be fine.

Not sure how connected you have to be but when I roll through those parts i plan my important calls around some of the towns and not rely on doing work from the road. It too risky in most cases.

"Cedar City is tough. Not a lot of options there to become comfortably stable financially, at least compared to other cities (Northern Utah and Las Vegas, in particular, as the wages in St. George aren't particularly mooning off the charts either). Are you willing to move somewhere else where the job market is more enticing?

You say you have a job but still can't afford to buy food. Are you working 40 hours per week? Curious, since if you're living in your car and not responsible for paying rent, where is the money going?

Unless you're truly married to Cedar City, I'd look to driving to a city where there will be more financial opportunities for you, and if you have to have some roommates for awhile, that may be what you have to consider to afford rent before you get to a place where you feel financially comfortable enough to afford rent/a mortgage on your own.",t2_53mqn,WeberStateWildcat,0,1631610346.0,0,t1_hcssfh9,hcssfh9,True,Bones_2L8,t3_pnyprt,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernutah/comments/pnyprt/is_there_anything_i_can_do_to_get_back_on_track/,Is there anything I can do to get back on track in Cedar City,/r/southernutah/comments/pnyprt/is_there_anything_i_can_do_to_get_back_on_track/hcssfh9/,8,r/southernutah,0,8

">Green Valley Gap

A lot of that area is still within city limits and is private property, although who actually owns it remains a mystery at the moment. The County assessor website is currently down. Do not camp there. The locals that live off Canyon View and Plantations will not hesitate to call police. The Mountain Bike Patrol unit also frequently patrols that area, as there's been lots of vagrants/transients camping there. That's likely why it was shut down in the first place.

As others have said, Sand Cove is great and relatively close to town. You can also camp out at Warner Valley, The Arizona Strip just south of the state line, and in the BLM lands West of Bloomington.

"To me, the only real way to experience Lake Powell is via houseboat. Rent a boat large enough for your group and then get at least one speed boat. This is the Lake Powell experience.  the desert heat, , lounging in the water. Under the stars, and respite of the evenings, building a fire. 

Use the speed boat to scout for a nice location to anchor the houseboat. Look for a gradual cove or beach that you can drive the house boat right up. You can do this in the main channel or up one of the side canyons. Once you find a good location, leave a couple of people with water, lawn chairs, etc. to guard the spot while the speed boat goes back to look for the houseboat and lead them to the location. Secure the anchors, so that a strong wind won't dislodge the boat. 

Then you can hike, SUP, fish, lounge in water, drink, etc. Speed boat can take groups water skiing or tubing, etc. 

Assign couples or teams to plan, buy, prepare and cook each meal on one particular day for the entire group. Everyone can bring their own snacky food, booze, community contributions, etc. 

It will be more work than staying in an Air BNB in Page, but will be more fulfilling. It's a lot of money too. If you do go to Page, you can rent a speed boat for a day or book a cruise. You could also look into things like Horseshoe Bend, Antelope Canyon, Glen Canyon Dam tour, etc. and other things in the area. There is a camping beach called Lone Rock.

"That's super interesting. It brings to mind some neat things I've been reading about land trusts lately! I wonder though, how familiar are you with what communities in rural Utah want from their land? I definitely get where you're coming from with this idea, but there isn't always a lot of community support in Utah for conservation, especially if it gets in the way of resource use such as mining or grazing. 

For example, the establishment of Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument stopped the proposed Andalex coal mine from being built. My understanding is that the mine had a ton of community support and some folks are still salty that the Monument took that out of the picture, as it would have meant a lot of jobs for the community. 

So I wonder, can conservation in Utah really look like allowing the community to make decisions for the land? Not to say that the federal government is necessarily doing any better at conservation... And definitely the state is not. But do you really think that, as a whole, struggling conservative communities in rural Utah see the value of conservation efforts over the use of the resources contained in them? I'm not sure myself.

Just in case this needs to be said, I definitely don't mean to be a downer on this idea, as it sounds really worth exploring and I am very much in favor of conservation efforts. I guess this is something I've also been trying to think through and it's interesting to talk about with someone who seems to have similar interests and values.

"I'm not sure how familiar you are with Utah and southern Utah culturally, but I would very strongly suggest that before you try to build a new organization in this area, you take at least several years living and working in conservation here, getting to know the community, and humbly inquiring into the ways people and organizations connect with the land already. 

There is a lot of pride and ownership here. There is also a lot of tension in land management. There are native people to involve. This project is going to take a lot of listening before anything else if you want to do it well, and there is a possibility that when you inquire into it, you find you're not wanted and need to step away. You should be ready to accept that, if that's what you find, or to join in on what's existing instead. 

You're asking to be an organizer in a community you are not part of. It's going to take a lot of work and a lot of humility to get there. Sounds like an interesting project and I'll be curious to hear where it goes! Good luck!

"Well California is pretty much a giant dumpster fire mess right now and everybody there seems to want to move out and come to Utah or a similar state. We’re happy to have people move in from California as long as they don’t bring they’re horrible politics, ideology, laws, and taxes, that ruined the once beautiful state of California. Not saying you will do that, but Utah, and especially Southern Utah is great for a many reasons, and we don’t want people coming here that will vote in leaders and laws to make this place another California.

Springdale is a great place and Southern Utah has pretty much no covid restrictions, you can walk into 99% of establishments without a make and nobody will say anything. Because in most people’s eyes here, you don’t really need to be that worried about a disease with a 99% survival rate. If you’re looking to move to a place with strict covid laws, Southern Utah is not the place.

Hope this helps.

"I know he wasn't univerally loved at DSC (back before it became DSU), but I took an accounting class from Kevin Barrett. The guy was insane. He was the most volitile, ustable teacher that I have ever delt with. 

The vast majority of my fellow students didn't love his approach. However, one thing that that meant so much to me, even to this day, was that he had very high expectations of his students. He pushed us all so hard to learn and master and love the material. I scraped by with a B in his class and it felt so much more special than any A that I earned from some of the other classes I took where the teacher didn't care half as much as Barrett did. 

Kevin passed away a few years ago.

"For anyone who would try to debate anonymous entities on the miasma that is the Internet I would like to quote this section of [Fall by Neal Stephenson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall;_or,_Dodge_in_Hell) about some Princeton graduate students talking to a proselytizer. It is a set of energy-saving reminders meant dissuade you from wasting your time.

> ""Professor Long,"" she muttered, ""the Red Card.""
>
> It was a reference to one of their teachers at Princeton who had gone so far as to print up a wallet card for people to keep in front of them during conversations like this one. One side of the card was solid red, with no words or images, and was meant to be displayed outward as a nonverbal signal that you disagreed and that you weren't going to be drawn into a fake argument. The other side, facing the user, was a list of little reminders as to what was really going on:
>
> 1. Speech is aggression
> 2. Every utterance has a winner and a loser
> 3. Curiosity is feigned
> 4. Lying is performative
> 5. Stupidity is power

"Definitely head east. Even on a motorcycle you will save a ton on gas because heading east on 12 is considerably more of a downhill travel. Plus I think heading east while the sun is setting and rising is much more beautiful then if you were headed west. If that makes sense. Haha. I don’t know how far you plan on traveling east but if you can take the 12 to the 24 east towards Hanksville be sure to check out Goblin Valley. Very cool little area. From Hanksville head north and jump on the 70 east until you reach Crescent Junction. Then take the 191 south to Moab and hit Arches. Plan on 2-3 days of road time if you really want to see it all. A lot of cool off road markers and history points on that route. Be sure to stop in Escalante and get a burger and a beer at the Circle D. They have great food and nice selection of local brews. After that, down the road a bit, you’ll hit Boulder, and they have couple great places to eat. I’d recommend the Burr Trail grill for lunch and Hell’s Backbone Grill for dinner.

"Guys, I need your help. I lost my beloved teddy yesterday somewhere around Highway 9, approx. between St. George and Mt. Carmel Junction, but that's only a guess. I was driving from Vegas on I15 and have pictures from the drive where he's still sitting under the windshield. I arrived at Bryce Canyon yesterday and he's gone :'-(

I stopped a few times to take pictures and it's my only explanation that I lost him there.

He's a small Steiff Teddy, about the size of a small hand, and there's something written at the back of his tag. I got him from my mum to keep me safe on my trips and he's been around the globe with me. It would mean the world to me if someone would find him. I will drive back the whole route to maybe see if I can find him, but my hopes are not really high right now as he's really small and not easily seen if on the ground.

Smaller trails I like are Emerald Pools, and the start of the Narrows. (The full Narrows is a huge event). Lots of other good ones there too.

Some fun stuff outside of the parks in the area too. North of Zions on I15 is Kanarraville, which has a set of waterfalls on a hike that's nice. It's overpacked lately though so may not be as nice as it use to.

"Asked my mom for some tips, she moved to Cedar from Minnesota in the 80s and had a big culture shock even though she was raised Mormon and at the time practicing.

So in addition to what others have said: the culture shock can be the biggest thing. Growing up in Cedar I had a lot of trouble making friends because my family wasn't religious, and that was the main way to socialize. They really respect anyone who's active in the community, so if you just socialize with other hunters and hikers you'll be fine. Maybe volunteer a little if you're up for it (summer and fall the Shakespearean Festival takes on volunteers, being an usher has a waitlist and it's mostly senior citizens). Hunting and hiking are both popular though so you should be good.

If people keep asking you to join the Church after you've politely and firmly told them no, ask them to *your* church's services on Sunday if you have one. Apparently that'll make them back off to know you believe in god. If you have a house missionaries will knock on the door every so often if you're not a (regularly attending) member of the Church. Apartments are sometimes skipped over depending on how nice it looks.

THERE IS NO BAR CULTURE. There's only two bars in town iirc and they both suck from what I've heard. Utah's liquor laws are restrictive so only mid-high end places and Chili's & Applebee's have booze. If you want to drink with friends the best way is to have a small party. The liquor store is one of the nicest in state, and the staff are all awesome.

There will be polygamous people in town, especially recently as a couple (or maybe one idk) of big groups have been moving in. The correct term for them is Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, or FLDS. They run from looking like our state's version of Amish pioneers (but driving trucks and using phones like anyone else) to modestly dressing but otherwise plain looking. The FLDS keep to themselves and aren't really interested in recruitment, the whole state basically has a policy of ""don't ask, don't tell"" regarding them. They're usually cool if leery of outsiders, but if you're not used to seeing them it's gonna be weird the first few times.

>Anybody got any good info? I was there half a day for the interview and the views were gorgeous and I had really good pizza at some wood fired place but aside from that that's all I know haha.

Cedar City is a more artsy/trendy place compared to the rest of Southern Utah. They have a Shakespeare festival and it's a college town.

>Mainly looking for info on things to do, places to eat, where to go etc. What's the good/bad part of town (my interviewer told me the north area and by the hospital wasn't the greatest).

As u/MissKaiterlin said, the area on the southwest side of town is quite a bit fancier and the new temple will cause the house prices to quadruple (people like having the House of the Lord as their next-door neighbor.) But as a college town, finding an inexpensive apartment shouldn't be too hard, especially in the summer time.

>Should I expect a little Mormon culture shock (they all seem welcoming and kind)?

I'd say about 80% of the people in Cedar City are LDS and a little over half are practicing. The religion isn't just something they do just on Sunday, it dominates every aspect of their life: your neighbors/co-workers will be spending much of their off-time organizing youth activities, food drives, service projects putting together musical presentations, etc. At the same time, they rely on each other for everything from finding jobs to finding a babysitter.

They're friendly folks, but they're also a close-knit community and so you'll find some degree of distrust as an outsider. If you're respectful of them, you'll be fine.

"Have a backup plan. I moved there and learned this the hard way. For starters 1/3 of the population or Iron County is below the poverty line. Most jobs were through a staffing agency, at Walmart, or Convergys. If you’re single it sucks. Especially if you’re over 25 or so. The only single women to meet at that age are single moms. The reason I say to have a backup plan is because if your job there goes south, good luck finding anything comparable that’s also local.

"I'm from St. George, but I have a few friends in Cedar, and close enough to get there in 45 minutes. 

- It snows, and it's cold, so be prepared for that. 
- South end of town by the new temple is some high brow shit, real fancy, but if you go closer downtown, it gets cheaper, but still reasonably maintained houses. There are a few apartment and townhouse complexes on the South end of town between Smith's grocery and the freeway. There are a few rental agencies near the college you can try if you're looking for property management companies too. 
-They have a drive-in called Ernie's that is a good Greasy's dive. I recommend the chicken strips, onion rings, or fried mushrooms. Sushi at Ninja is the delicious and perfect for hangovers. Haha. Pastry Pub is also good from what I hear, but I have yet to go. 
- Zions Nations Park (Springdale and Wildcat Willy's), Cedar Breaks (camping on the rim), Bryce Canyon, Navajo Lake, Panguitch Lake all within an hour. Go there. 
- Duck Creek and Kolob for hunting from what I hear, talk to the locals, they love to tell stories. Haha. 
- Yes they are nice, but yes, there is a lot of Mormon culture. It gets to be a bit much at times, but if you're tough skinned, you'll pay it no mind. There are still pockets of badasses here. 
- They do fun small-town things, like festivals, parades, art in the park, etc. The Shakespeare Festival is awesome. 

I am rambling at this point, but that should be a good start.

"Kanab native, now living in vegas here.

Sounds like a good plan.  I personally love the calf creek area.  It's a beautiful drive, and I personally love isolation. You won't get isolation in the national parks. The whole area along the ""burr trail"" is just remarkable scenery. (google it for some pics)

You can ask the Best Friends natives if they can give you directions to [""peekaboo"" slot canyon](https://www.google.com/search?q=peekaboo+slot+canyon&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGkbr-uNfUAhVDVWMKHez4B1oQ_AUICygC&biw=1563&bih=914).  It's only about a mile from the best friends sanctuary. Nothing as pretty as, say, antelope canyon, but so easy to access it's worth it.

If you want to see some petroglyphs, stop  by the Kanab BLM office and ask for some good hikes. There are TONS.

Zion is close enough to Kanab, that you could stay there the whole time and day-trip into the park.  (or not, whatever.)  

Kanab is also close enough to the Grand Canyon (north rim) that you should consider a day trip if you've never been. Check it off the bucket list kind of thing.  Again, if you love getting more remote locations and you have access to a beefy vehicle, [Toroweap](https://www.google.com/search?q=peekaboo+slot+canyon&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGkbr-uNfUAhVDVWMKHez4B1oQ_AUICygC&biw=1563&bih=914#tbm=isch&q=toroweap) is a much longer drive from Kanab,  but is a SUPER isolated part of the Grand Canyon.  Some people love that kind of thing, so just throwing it out there.

[Antelope canyon](https://www.google.com/search?q=peekaboo+slot+canyon&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiGkbr-uNfUAhVDVWMKHez4B1oQ_AUICygC&biw=1563&bih=914#tbm=isch&q=antelope+canyon) isn't too far for a day trip. World class slot canyon there. 

There's an ""off books"" hike in Zion if you want to get a little wet just for fun.  At the bottom of the switch-backs below the long tunnel there is a pull-off area [right on the last curve](https://www.google.com/maps/place/37%C2%B012'59.9%22N+112%C2%B057'55.8%22W/@37.216645,-112.9665938,437m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d37.216645!4d-112.96549) (or first curve if you're heading UP) by the bridge.

Just follow the river upstream and you'll find a nice little pool with a bit of a natural slide.  Good for cooling off.  Not nearly as scenic as some of the main hikes though. 

If zion is too crowded and you happen to be staying on the west side, it's not too far of a drive to get to [Kanarraville falls](https://www.google.com/search?q=kanarraville+falls&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj3pN7EutfUAhUFxmMKHQOWDo4Q_AUICygC&biw=1563&bih=914).  Kanarraville falls is a hike that is, IMO just as appealing as the Narrows, but much much less crowded.  

Finally, Kanab itself has developed a trail system that is quite nice and gets you up into the buttes and crags, which is fun.  Stop by the BLM office and ask about ""Salyredas"" which is a nice hike (pretty steep for the first 1/4 mile tho) to a ""hanging garden"" micro-climate, or any other fun locales they recommend.  [Here's an album of kanab area hikes](https://medium.com/@gregoryhamblin/kanab-utah-hikes-1fbfab81b97d) my friend took last year, including peekaboo, salyredas, sand dunes, dino tracks and a few others. 

It's hot this year, so bring PLENTY of water and don't over-exert yourself. Stay safe.

"I'm kanab raised, but no longer living there. 

There is no evening ""life"", but plenty of outdoors things to do. Fishing, hiking, atving all available. Lots of tight-knit social circles of all sorts.

Cost of living is a bit higher than you might expect.  Property owners think that the economy never went bad in 08 so property prices are a bit high, IMO.

Check out the Red Sands trail there, its top notch. I don't know what level of hikers you guys are but there is plenty of magnificent stuff in the area.

So I'm not 100% certain but if I had to guess I'd say you would be completely fine with just hiking shoes in late November, if you have water shoes then great but I wouldn't plan on buying them just for that, unless you're doing other water hikes like the narrows in Zion. The water will be really cold I'm sure but if you're just passing by its not too much of a hike in the actual water to get to the cool parts. Angels landing is definitely a must do.

Angel's Landing is a must do it seems. I will check out hidden Canyon and observation point too.

"To answer some of your questions:

Regular gear with layers should be perfect. It might get a little cold in November during the night but it won't be too bad. 

All of those places you should check out but I have a couple more to add.. Kanarraville Falls is awesome, it's near cedar city. See if you can bid for a pass at The Wave near Kanab, it's hard to get into but if you get lucky it will be really cool. Also, check out Horseshoe Bend and maybe the slightly overpriced Antelope Canyon  near Page Arizona. In Zion the best hike would be Angel's Landing for sure, also try observation point and hidden canyon. 

A small compact car should be fine unless you are planning to camp or go off roading, which an SUV / Jeep would be nice to have for. Crowds will probably be busy since it's Thanksgiving and the weather is the best in southern Utah during that time but it is what it is. 

I can just think of pack some good hiking shoes, shorts and pants you can hike in depending on the weather. Make sure to bring short sleeve stuff but also a jacket or two, maybe one of them being rain resistant. A backpack to use while hiking.

"> our M.O. is to rent a house with a pool on VRBO. We have most of our meals at the house.

Last time I checked vacation rentals are illegal in St. George proper. But Washington, Hurricane, Ivins etc. are all a go for the most part.  

> Is St. George the right place for this? 

Yes.

> Is there a better place to look that is within a 3-hour drive of Las Vegas?

Probably not.

> We'll have to rent all our gear or find tour guides for all our activities. Are all those things available there? Everything on the list is negotiable but mountain bikes. There has to be a shop we can rent decent bikes from.

https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-rock-bicycle-co-saint-george?hrid=pDc43dbDnT-QABShdDB-ZA

> Are there neighborhoods in the are we need to avoid?

Most of the area is really good.  If you find a rental and want an opinion on it, you can PM me with it and I'll let you know.  I grew up down here and just moved back a few years ago.

> Bars/liquor stores? You all are probably tired of answering questions about Utah liquor laws, but we're from Wisconsin so access to booze is important. So, are there bars? Can we get a drink with dinner if we go out?

State-run liquor stores.  Closed on Sundays 11 AM to 10 PM most other days. (Probably better to stock up in NV).  A lot of restaurants have liquor licenses, you should be good.  In St. George there is one bar.  Named ""The One and Only"".

> How's the weather in June?

Should be around 98-100 degrees at the peak of the day.

> Finally, anything else we should see while we're out there?

Zions is a must. 
Snow canyon is a good stop. https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/snow-canyon/
If you want to get away from the heat for a day Pine Valley has some great hikes. Burger Peak or Signal Peak are quite difficult, but the view cannot be beat. http://www.alltrails.com/us/utah/pine-valley
You can also go up towards Cedar City for a day, Kannaraville Falls (http://www.alltrails.com/explore/recording/kanarraville-falls--4) is quite fun. Then you can go catch a show at the Shakespeare Festival in Cedar City. 
For swimming, there's Sand Hollow Reservoir that's pretty popular. 
There's plenty of Jeep tours, Hiking and Horseback riding, Google is your friend.  You could also call Red Rock Bicycles and get referrals for anything else you want to rent/do.

"St. George seems like a good place for what you're looking for. Tour guides should be available for everything you're wanting to do. I see bike shops throughout the town so I'm sure there's some decent rental places. I know they have the redbull rampage near hurricane so I'm sure there's a good mountain bike rental market. 

I would probably avoid Dixie downs and maybe certain areas of Washington (the obviously lower end of the income areas). Nothing will happen to you if you don't but those are just the only places I can think of that are not as nice as most of the city. 

Not many bars and the liquor stores close early. While driving up from Vegas, make a stop in Mesquite, NV and buy all of your drinks there. It's cheaper and it has a higher % of alcohol compared to Utah's restrictions.

Once a storm rolled in just north of  Cedar City that created white out conditions and that's when I called it quits and got a hotel for the night. Safety isn't all about how well equipped your vehicle is. My biggest concern is other drivers or a semi plowing through it or losing control and taking you out.

In a nut shell, you can do the drive most likely, just watch the weather. 

Bryce will be under snow and Zion will be cold and possibly snowy as well. Still they are beautiful places to see, and less crowded in the winter. You can see some of the attractions just don't plan on doing a lot of hiking unless you're equipped for snow hiking. I know Bryce  often does moonlight snowshoeing, so that could be fun. You could get a room at the Rubys Inn and rent them. The Zion lodge is also very inexpensive in the winter. I say go for it but be prepared to extend your trip by a day or two due to weather. Also, don't attempt driving in bad weather, not worth it. It's other cars that will ruin your day.

"It's going to be a bit dicey that time of the year. Bryce is up to 9,100 ft in elevation (2778 meters). There will almost definitely be snow up there. You can better determine your itinerary as the time nears, when you will have a better idea of the weather conditions and forecasts. The drive from SLC to Vegas itself will usually be fine since all of your driving will be on a major interstate that gets plowed. Still, it's a good idea to check the weather and road conditions before you set out. I-15 can, and does, get icy in December.

"I can't speak to Zion in the winter (have been several times but only in summer), but I visited Bryce Canyon once on October 1 and it snowed 6 inches overnight.

Snow melted the next day, but weather conditions could be tricky at higher elevations (Kolob Canyons and the east side of Zion, all of Bryce).

"Pay for the extended damn tour....if you are only going to go this one time might as well.  my wife and i found it fun and informative and the young one will definelty think its cool going into the belly of the damn.  

As far as zion with an 11 year old look to pa'rus trail from the visitor center to canyon junction....then catch the shuttle and ride it all the way to the last stop and do the riverside walk down to the river then play in the water and walk back...on the shuttle back down stop and do weeping rock at the weeping rock stop. If you have time do the lower emerald pool on the way out at the zion lodge stop

On your way to bryce stop in zion as you leave towards the east and after you get out of the big tunnel park and do the canyon overlook trail.  

In Bryce go to all the view points by car and do as much of the queen garden trail as you can.

Cedar breaks is a must if you're at Brian Head do the view points by car and hike the alpine pond trail short and awesome totally different than Bryce or Zion and the wild flowers are just after peak and some are definelty still out.

Also check out the junior ranger program at each park (cedar,zion,bryce) the programs run to age 12 and they can get sworn in at each of the three parks and collect 3 badges tons of fun

Food in springdale outside zion...whiptail, spotted dog, Oscar's, cafe soliel, meme's cafe all are great

Food in cedar city near brianhead...lots of semi elevated chain resturaunts

Food near bryce (actually dont eat in bryce) but on the upper east side of zion is thunderbird cafe in mt. carmel junction, get the pie and check out their retro original sign at the entrance.

"If you go to Zion and are looking for food, by no means go to the Pioneer restaurant in Springdale.  Even if you are starving, just don't go.  The food is terrible, service, terrible, and to give you more of an anecdote last time I was there they has an unlit Budweiser neon sign on the wall.  One table's patrons asked about beer and the server  apologized because they don't serve alcohol.  Really this place doesn't deserve to be in business.

Maybe a bit more helpful info too...if you hike the narrows, do not take off your footware, and do bring a stick or pole for support.  Angels Landing is a great hike if you aren't afraid of heights...the trail appears dangerous but the biggest danger are the crowds, if you are not an experienced hiker, avoid going unless its a weekday or early morning.  There's also some nice swimming holes to hang out around if that's your speed.

Bryce is amazing, the Navajo loop is well worth the minor effort.  If you are looking for a bigger hike, add the peekaboo loop (+2-3mi), or look at the fairyland loop (7ish mi).

"I'm pretty sure there's a shuttle from Springdale to Zion. Sounds like there's a way to get to Springdale from others posts.

I highly recommend the Observation Point Trail! You climb a lot, but no scrambling/rock climbing needed. The trail is usually around 4' wide. There are places where an extremely heights adverse person may have a problem. Most of them are early on so if your bothered by them then you could turn back.

Emerald Pools is a must!

You could hike Angles Landing to Scout Lookout point and then head back. This trail will be very busy though.

"Easy answer: yes. Difficult answer: you will want to be careful if the roads are wet or slick at all. Boulder Mountain (the section of 12 from Boulder Town to Torrey and Hwy 24) is the only really worrisome part. And it's plowed pretty regularily. Remember, this road is used not just for tourists but residents of all the towns between Bryce and Torrey.

Please make arrangements to TRIPLE the time from Bryce to Moab that any map program gives. You want plenty of time to stop. My suggestions: Kodachrome, The Escalante River where it crosses Hwy 12 (between Escalante and Boulder), multiple stops before and after the Hwy 12 bridge (the Hogsback in particular) including Calf Creek Falls if you're hikers and the weather is nice, a couple of stops on Boulder Mtn to look at the waterpocket fold aka Capitol Reef, and a must stop to see Torrey (even though it will be mostly closed for the winter).

Absolutely do the Capitol Reef drive and stop at least for the rock art on Highway 24.

Also, if you have time and the inclination, Goblin Valley is really really cool. Nothing else like it at all anywhere.

On the way to Moab (from the freeway to 191) there are a couple of neat places: dinosaur tracks and the like.

"There are a few.  Obviously Zion National Park is one of the places that is just incomparable, and Bryce is quite unique in it's geology. 

If I were making a trail through southern utah, I would    travel east to west, starting with the burr trail, following it out through escalante and bryce, then down through the Grand Staircase National Monument probably through Johnson Canyon down to Kanab, Consider a detour to Arizona's Antelope Canyon for a day, or the Wave, or both,  then hike up Cottonwood Canyon just to the west of Kanab to see the ruins of the old Kanab Movie Fort and to hunt for all the Native American ruins and rock art. Up to the coral pink sand dunes state park, then down through ""the barracks"" into Zion.

My route, however, prefers avoiding people. 

Other considerations: cliff jumping at Lake Powell, walking the edge of the Grand Canyon at Toroweap, Visiting the Utah Shakespearean Festival in Cedar City, Kanarraville Falls trail, volunteering at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary, visiting tourist traps like Moqui Cave, Getting ice cream at the Dairy in Beaver City, and so on.

You need to get a book by [Mike Kelsey](http://kelseyguidebooks.com/). Specifically the [Boater’s Guide to Lake Powell](http://kelseyguidebooks.com/?page_id=89)

I am going to warn you about his books. Do not think I don't want you read it. I have multiple editions of some of his titles. But unlike Mr. Kelsey, I want you to have a good time and not chop your arm off.

NEVER use him as your only source if information. Once you find the name of a canyon you want to hike look it up on the internet for other people's trail logs. 

The information is very dense but you should read all of it he will give little tips in that vast wall of text. 

He only uses the metric system. It is like a 1970's math book.

His personal hiking times are crazy fast. He does not look at anything on the trail. He just speed hikes it. An average person hikes 2-3 mph keep that in mind when looking at the length of the hikes.

He likes to wear short shorts in photos. :Shiver:

Another great source of info is a Utah canyoneering chat board [Bogley](http://bogley.com/) They have a whole board about [kayaking](http://www.bogley.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?28-Kayak-Raft-Canoe-and-Tubing)

"I've lived in Cedar valley for all my life and recently moved back in, so I'll do my best!  :>

The live music scene here is actually pretty big, if you wanna come like right now there will be Groovefest coming up soon.  Basically a live music festival that lasts for a few days.  We're known as 'Festival City' because we have a lot of Festivals, mostly during summer.

As someone else pointed out there are a lot of Mormons, they're mostly nice but they're almost as bad as a Jehovah's Witness when it comes to recruiting so just remember that Utah is the Mormon Holy Land.  Almost everything is closed or has heavily reduced hours on Sundays, so it's a rest day no matter if you want it or not.  Good day to go out hiking though, the parks will be open (even if their shops aren't).  The Mormon 'problem' is a lot better than it used to be, but it'll be hard to find friends when you don't go to church.  Just power through and go to gatherings.

We have some of the strictest alcohol laws so the only place to buy something that isn't watered down beer is the State Liquor Store which luckily Cedar has, but it's closed Sunday because they all have to be closed at least one day a week.  We're only two hours from the closest city on the other side of Nevada border, Mesquite, so if you want to day trip to buy some good booze or gamble a little that's your destination.  It's just another hour to get to Las Vegas.  Utah has absolutely no gambling allowed.

Unless you want to live outside the city, you're not gonna have a backyard full of the mountains or forest.  It's a desert, so the only true forests are above the alpine line.  So for forest it's an hour commute, out in the middle of no where, isolated, good internet, likely to have roads cut off a few times a year, especially during winter.  It's also a much harder winter on top of the mountain.  You will have some adjusting to do, but luckily Cedar has sun 9/10ths of the year, so you won't have to worry about driving in the snow too much if you don't leave the city.  You will always be able to see mountains though.

On the climate, you might have to worry about nose bleeds due to the dryness and altitude.  Don't do any hiking for the first day or two you're here, so your body can get used to the lack of moisture and breathable oxygen.  I have an aunt who lives closer to sea level who has trouble breathing and needs an oxygen tank when she visits.  I'm not trying to scare you, I just don't want you to overdo it and get too excited when you first visit.

August is a long, hot, dry month.  Most precipitation comes during monsoon season in July and as snow during December.

"Hey sweet! Finally a question I can answer! I currently reside in Cedar City and have for mostly the entirety of my life.

1.  Places to go is up on the Canyon / Rusties. It's very scenic and you drop about 20 degrees going up. The road will take you to Brian head if you travel far enough. There is also another trail that you can drive up that brings you to the 'C' overlook. Awesome drive, really windey and fun to take the Mustang out. Main street also has some pretty different attractions.
2. I totally recommend going to Centros Pizza. It's a local dive here, and I think it's phenomenal. Another pizza dive is Pizzacart, I've never had but it's talked highly. There's also Hermies / Top Spot for authentic and retro burgers. Hong Kong Buffet (love this place) / China kitchen (eh) for Chinese. Sweet Basil for Tai. There's quite a few that happens in the Coffee shop down main for music and the local park next to the library as well. A good trail is Kanarraville Falls.. Super fun hike.
3. You would most likely be very well off with that price range of rental. High end townhomes go for near 800$.(Cedar Crossing is an amazing place although not overlooking anything they are really nice. I think their 3/2? But don't quote me on that. We do their internet so if it ever goes down, you could get me! haha..)

Hope I helped! Cedar is really a great place to live. Highs have been 90ish this week, lows can get down to the below zeros, but it's really nice to have all 4 seasons and for one not to be TOO intense. :) We do get quite a lot of snow, but it's awesome as we all hope for a white Christmas.. (I've seen 2 while living her for about 11 years or so.. Great childhood memories of snow, and I love it.)",t2_8wa2g,pryvisee,0,1435033841.0,0,t1_csfkzn7,csfkzn7,True,Flew42,t3_3ash11,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernutah/comments/3ash11/thinking_of_relocating_for_a_job_in_cedar_city/,Thinking of relocating for a job in Cedar City.

"Hey. I have lived in Cedar for the past 5 years, and have been in Southern Utah for basically all my life. 

I may be able to help a little, but on some things I don't know.

1. Mid twenties are good, its a college town, lots of people this age.

2. Agnostic- obviously. this can be a problem if you want to make it one. I'm LDS (mormon). A lot of cedar is LDS. There are also other christian denominations and agnostic people as well but not the majority. So there is that, make sure you know what you're getting into with that.

3. There is great food, music, hiking and biking in cedar. No worries there!

4. Tropical climate- I hope you are ready for some big weather changes. Cedar is a cold desert and is one of the Highest cities in utah. Cold desert meaning it gets to below zero at night in the winter, and I've seen it at 100 in the summer. Be ready for that and the atmosphere change when coming from sea level. Winter will be hard. Just make sure your car is covered and maintained well, and never turn off your heat if you are leaving during the winter. But if you like skiing or snowshoeing or camping or anything like that cedar is a great place to try it. 

5. What to expect- expect it like any other small town that has a college in it. Lots of people all school long, with significant differences in the local population come summer, because of all the tourist stuff. But its a nice bigger small town. 

6. Not too sure what areas to stay away from since i had 2 great places for the whole 5 years i was there. Are you looking to be left alone or have a lot of nice neighbors?

7. Trails and parks, all over, they are great. Couple in town. Stores, not much big name brand stuff besides wall mart and home depot. Main street has a lot of places, some name brand most not. 

8. Rental market was rough for college kids. I didn't have a ton of money and thought the market was high, but it'll probably seem low to you if you are coming from a bigger city and used to higher rents. I hope your husband's job pays pretty well. more than 12-15$  an hour and you should be fine. You could probably find that price, but I'm not sure about the forest or mountain part.

9. Cedar is a valley, so you have a great mountain right there all the time, and forests up on top so your not going to get that unless you go out a little ways from the major part of the city. 

10. If you drink, (I don't) from what I know, the state liquor store is the best place to get some of the more expensive stuff like rums wines, and basically besides a dilute beer, again I'm not sure since i don't drink. 


overall, I really enjoyed cedar. Its annoying sometimes because there isn't always the most to do, but I love smaller to midsize towns. Not a big city person. If you are, St. George is about an hour away (my hometown) and there is always lots to do there. To be honest what i see being your biggest problem is the fact you are agnostic. So I don't know how you l feel towards people and religion, but you may get treated a little different when people find that out. I'm sorry, but people in our religion do that sometimes especially in these smaller towns. I hate it, and I try and be open with all people, but don't not expect people to hang out with you once, find that out that you're agnostic and not hang out with you again. Like I said, it can be a problem if you make it out to be. Expect to get invited to church or meet the missionaries. Its part of being mormon, we like to try and share what we believe. A polite no thank you is usually enough to quell the invites, and still keep friends. Let me know if this helped or if I can help anymore. Good luck with your travels.

"Mammoth Creek has a few primitive campsites. It is a few miles east of Duck Creek Village.  Off of Hwy 14 at FR 050, IIRC. Check the State of Utah's site for maps, here is a link to lots of them: http://www.utah.com/maps/

Also, where Mammoth Creek meets the Sevier River has a nice area to camp. Sometimes there are cow herds nearby, but they don't bother you. (No services) Take the road that follows the river (old US 89 turns off of US 89) just south of Hatch. When you get to Mammoth Creek going under the road, turn left (before the bridge) and follow the dirt road to the spot under the trees. 

I think any of the lakes in this area are going to be too cold to swim, but there is hiking everywhere. If you fish, this area is awesome.

"I had this same idea a few years back but never really did much with it. Definitely a great idea, but you are somewhat alienating your biggest market in the area: the retired people. Two ideas: first, find a way to make it SUPER easy for less tech-savvy people to order (like a call-in number or something), and then make cards/flyers/whatever physical advertising you need to and then get it out to the retiree population. Second, have you considered adding a grocery shopping/errand running service to this? I think there are many retirees who would take advantage of something like that, where they could call you up to run down to the wal-mart and pick up something.  Or even send you a full shopping list and you could do the whole shopping and bring it to them.

"You asked for advice or reasoning, I gave it to you, then you apologized for any inconsistencies.

"The best way for me to elaborate right now would be to generate a sample opinion piece.

Opinion: French Fries are too salty

French fries annoy me because they're salty. Also they are too sodium packed with salt. I don't know how anyone else likes french fries with salt, but I don't. I walked into a restaurant, and there was salt in my fries. I don't like salt in my French fries.

So when I saw salt on my French fries I thought ""wow, that's a lot of salt"". Personally, high blood pressure is a big deal, so when I see salt on my French fries my reaction is to ask for French fries without salt.

When I walked into that restaurant, I saw the salt and realized that asking for no salt would be too much of a hassle. Why is there French fries with salt? 

So then I asked for no salt and I noticed it'd take too long so I brushed the salt off myself when I got home. Also I don't like salt in my French fries.

The thought that keeps bouncing around my mind is that French fries have too much salt, just like I thought of it when I ordered french fries without salt.

That's how it reads. No real pacing, just a series of thoughts thrown in, on and off, repetitively. Too much internal, 1st person dialog mixed with narrative. Sometimes breaking those rules pays off, but only if the content and general storyline isn't repeated or mixed amongst the thoughts in an non-linear fashion. It reads like gonzo jornalism, but broken gonzo jornalism, or gonzo journalism as interpreted by a 12 year old. 

If you've ever read a poem written by someone who just learned about basic poetry, you'll notice those ""thick"" copies of other works. Like a *reverse-mad libs* of professional jornalism, in which the nouns/adjectives/verbs have already been chosen, yet the structure/body/lead/linearity is open to manipulation by the writer.

"Ah good, faith in local journalism restored, if these were published as lifestyle or whichever section I thought it was a few weeks ago...well, let's just say that I was disturbed by the unprofessional pacing and general storytelling issues.
