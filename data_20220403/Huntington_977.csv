"I'll fill in for a non April fool's joke. And I don't want this to be overly interpreted as negative. I'm just taking OPs post as a good reason to vent. 

Also I understand that reddit has turned mainstream and many newer people online, people in WV, or just new people to the internet might not ""get"" culturally why people on the internet rant but I would ask for your patience and understanding. Sometimes I personally need an outlet. 

This place, Huntington, is a thesis of an ""America left behind.""

I work lightly in media and there is a aesthetic/romanticization of an ""America left behind,"" ""strangers in their native land,"" (from a SJW perspective) a white fragility - that you can taste in the air here.  This is characterized by topes like the ""old local industry"" (steel), streets of fast food joints and degenerative car culture (5th Ave and route 60), the known opioid crisis, a lack of modern reform or infrastructure, poor education, lots of old people, white urban degeneracy, ""best jobs are government jobs,"" And more. 

Think media that shows places like Detroit, Pittsburg, Philadelphia, old Boston, Alabama, ""Walmart killed downtown."" We got that aesthetic in spades here in Huntington. 

Think about the old parts of town, just the buildings and setting- no people- Old factories and warehouses, old rail lines, old people with trucks, decaying 100+ year homes. Roads that vary between brick and asphalt. Torn up Alleys and overgrown lots.

Now fill the people. Every other person walking in the street is there because they ""have to walk"" not because they choose to. 
The cars are as desperate as they are disparite- from the local Tesla to the local minivan on it's last legs. For every young person you see working a counter there are 5 old people doing the same job. Around dinner you see most every fast food place with it's drive through filled with some cars spilling out into the street causing traffic. 

Not much about the town screams success or competency. It communicates decay, survival, a city unprepared for the speed of progress.

This is all relative to what? What do we measure decay by? Well by the essential services that support the town, the stuff that by necessity must stay up to date. Stuff like, IMO our parks and recs department.  
Modern police and fire department stuff. Newly built school and hospital buildings. Modern big box stores albeit in the next town over. The weird retrofits or new construction residential buildings.  All of these newer styles or retrofits exist in a stark contrast to it's surroundings. When every other building is burning out or abandoned it's easy to see it too. 

These descriptions are inspired by my daily life. Just bought a house last year and we got robbed 5 months in. My neighbor on one side is too cheap to fix his house that is falling apart. The neighbor on the other side is an old widow with a drug fueled brother. 
Across the alley is a quiet old couple that live next to a neighbor that frequently goes down on ""all fours"" to eat dirt around his trash bags???!!! (Meth?, Fentanyl?)

Marshall University is no saving grace. In my very limited experience with them . . . The management, some department profs, and especially the students/graduates seem to play into the stereotypes of the pay for degree mill degeneracy that is the American college experience. It's cool that the town has pride in the school but (with respect)it seriously might have milked the football tragedy too much all these years later and the cow is now dry. What else does Marshall have pride for? It's alumni? To be honest, I sometimes play with the idea that I would rather take a young hard working WV tradesman and teach them an office job before considering a Marshall grad. 


The same way that it's not enough to simply have a degree, also It is not enough to simply exist and have history. It's a weird type of American privilege trap that seems to affect old America. 


It's like everyone paints themselves the underdog/darkhorse coming up. But then they never actually come up. They just stay down.

It's great to have history and a story, yes. But without progress or innovation it's doomed to decay. 


You can taste that in the air here. It's too easy to say that this town is backwards or isn't as modern as others. You can easily joke that towns like Huntington are easily 20 years behind a modern city.

It's not enough to say time stands still here.  Every experience/aesthetic I have described is like a bad time machine. Its like it drags you back to bad parts of the past. 

If I wanted to end this on a positive note I'd say some people see this like knowing the future. Knowing the winning trends as the city improves and will work for the future. But more bad news is that the old guard in charge of most business and politic still are stuck on 90s strip mall ideas like whatever the hell Pullman square is.",t2_bfe9s,climbonapply24head,0,1648899683.0,0,t1_i33j5my,i33j5my,False,BabySnail_95,t3_tu2eqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/tu2eqz/i_hate_it_here_sometimes/,I hate it here sometimes.,/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/tu2eqz/i_hate_it_here_sometimes/i33j5my/,3,r/HuntingtonWV,1,3

"I don’t really recommend the Village. Maybe when it was new, but now it has years of abuse by college kids and was pretty run down last time I was there (~5 years ago). You’d also have to listen to parties all night and deal with drunk people milling about at all hours. 

I’d highly recommend Waterford Village in Barboursville, I used to live there and loved it. Very nice, clean grounds, well-maintained. Excellent pool area, basketball courts, option for garage if you want that. It’s the best larger apartment complex you’re going to find in the Huntington area. Only about a 10 minute easy drive to Marshall’s PT school. My rent was $1,050 for a spacious 2BR/2BA if I remember correctly. 

If not that, I’d look for some standalone house/duplex/apartments around the Ritter Park area, Southside (like 11th, 12th, 13th avenues between 1st and 8th street), Barboursville, Ceredo/Kenova, or over in Proctorville/Chesapeake, Ohio (right across the river from Huntington). 

Have to be careful in Huntington because you can have a super nice area then drive a couple blocks and it be complete garbage. I’d recommend visiting the area before you sign a lease. Or if you can’t, feel free to PM me if you find a possibility, happy to tell you if it’s a good area or not.

"I recommend south side, west of 9th st. Anything east of 9th st is hit or miss, unless you’re within a couple blocks of Ritter Park. Depending how close you wanna live to campus.

It’s the nicest place to live in Huntington in my opinion bc it’s close to Ritter Park, and there are a bunch of trees in these neighborhoods. It’s residential, with apartments scattered throughout.

"> if it's billed as part of a doctor's office visit, it is not

If that is true, just visit a doctor at HIMG.  There are plenty of them.

I used to go there and have blood work done every 6 months, no charge.  Then I switched doctors to one affiliated with CHH, thought it would be the same and was hit with a $700 bill for labwork.  Admittedly that could've been due to a change in my insurance, but it could also be the same thing you're running into.

FWIW if you just need normal bloodwork and nothing special you can hit the CHH/St Mary's discount wellness profiles.  My new doctor clued me in after I hit the ceiling over that $700 bill.  This link is for St Mary's but they have the same thing at CHH and HIMG, all once a quarter.

"Also wanted to mention a little quirk in our food culture. If you go to any of these drive ins and order a hot dog, the traditional WV hot dog consists of sauce, mustard, diced onions and Cole slaw. The sauce is chili sauce - it is typically sweeter with a bit of onion in it. Of course, you can order a hot dog any way you want (although sauerkraut and relish typically aren't options). Alot of places throw sliced cheese on top of you ask for cheese, but Austin's melts theirs. Chili and cheese sauce ain't really a thing at the drive ins. 

And before I forget, a word on pepperoni rolls. Roger and Manzanita are damn good traditional rolls, but Miss Pepioli brand has a very sweet bread.

"If you're not from Appalachia originally, stop at a Tudors biscuit world. It's a regional fast food biscuit joint that started in Huntington. Milton has probably the easiest on and off from the interstate. All the biscuit sandwiches are good, with the exception of chicken. Coffee is a bit piss thin, but drinkable. 

Austin's ice cream is freaking amazing in ceredo. Also, their hot dogs are pretty dope. If you don't mind trekking a mile or two off the interstate, there's a frost top on the 16th street exit in Huntington. Personally, I think there's better places for food, but their root beer floats are dope. It's a drive in, a d getting food to go is no problem. 

The best drive in in Huntington is the Midway Diner. Hot dogs are good, but the burgers are freaking amazing for quick in and out service. The best way to it is the 5th street exit in Huntington, but it may be a little off the beaten path for you. Also, they're closed on Sundays. 

If you like guns, the fifth street exit has Bare Arms, where you can rent guns at an indoor range. There's also a burger and bbq restaurant attached to it that's ok. Also off that exit is the Huntington museum of art, which is super affordable (I think admission is $5 a head) and has trails around it. It's easy to go through that museum in about 30 minutes if you're like me and don't contemplate paintings for hours. The trail system is hilly and I believe a total of 2 miles. 

Over in barboursville, the mall is right off the exit as well. Unlike alot of areas of the country, the mall is still going pretty strong. 


To be frank, Eastern Kentucky is a bit sparse east of Lexington. I'm not very familiar with anything west of Morehead, but from Morehead to Huntington, there's not much. Grayson has a decent BBQ joint, but it's sit down service. There's also a mennonite market in Grayson as well. Morehead has a craft brewery, but it's in town which is about a mile or two from the interstate.

"Pullman square has events all the time during the summer, including every Friday. If you like running, there's a ton of local races, including fun run type things, where you can meet other runners. Check out [aptiming.com](https://aptiming.com) or [tristateracer.com](https://tristateracer.com) for local running events. Robert's Running Shop on 4th avenue also used to host some weekly runs, although I'm not sure if they do that anymore.

If you're looking for places and routes to run, I could spout off a list.

The art museum also has a trail system all the way around it now. Go visit the museum and go for a hike/run after.

For sports, attend a Marshall game - soccer (National Champs, woohoo!), football, or basketball. First home football game is this Saturday.

For reading, Central City Cafe is the bookstore another commenter mentioned. There's also the Inner Geek in Pullman. I'm not sure of any book clubs in the area though.

For the arts, the Ritter Park amphitheater has local productions of shows put on by the Huntington Area Regional Theatre group ([https://www.facebook.com/HARTInThePark](https://www.facebook.com/HARTInThePark)), and you also have the Marshall Artists' Series bringing in professional acts occasionally.

For music, the V Club, Blacksheep Burrito, 9th Street Live, Pullman Square, Mountain Health Arena, etc.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

">Edit: But, I am socially inept IRL, so it doesn't surprise me that I suck at personal interaction online as well.

At least your self aware. I just trawled through your post history and I just noticed a pattern. I meant no harm. 

If you are as social inept and successful as you say you are -I thought you might appreciate some blunt honesty from my otherwise benign comment. 

I think a comment like yours can suck out the pride or fun a community might have in a local school system. It struck me as a bit tone deaf the way you compared Las Vegas to WV (Stereotypically an undereducated state.)

On kids, I think all kids need good positive reinforcement in regards to their potential and confidence. But comments like yours might poison the well in a conversation about comparing one group of kids to another (WV to las vegas). I think your comment automatically assumes WV kids at a disadvantage which is a bit unfair.  While the results, records, and facts of your assumption might be fair and sound; its just a bit tone deaf yea?

Anyway, Coding, robotics and general STEM stuff are not performed in a social vacuum. Some of the best coders and robotic engineer's I know work with fantastic collaborative teams that require great social skills, and creativity.

If I had to salvage this into any sort of pitch, I would have to say that with all that said,  in regards to those small social quirks and technology I might have more to teach your kids than you.

* People would be handing out bibles constantly
* At least once a week the entire cafeteria was turned into a prayer meeting
* In 9th grade my history teacher spent an entire class telling us about how Christianity was the one true religion
* Basically every teacher had religious posters and stuff up in their classes
* My brother was pulled out of class and preached to for over an hour because one of his teachers found out he was an atheist

And get their root beer in the frosty mug.  The whole experience is so cool, like going back in time.  I had to leave Huntington and ALL my family when I was 4.5 years old.  It's nice to visit there and see a few things that haven't changed.  My memories there are so strong.

On my last visit I could not eat the buns because I found out I had celiac disease.  I was really sad about not getting the full hot dog, but they did make it for me without a bun and it was still good.  The meat sauce is smooth and slightly sweet.  The hot dog is really soft.  Not sure if they steam it or what.  The onions are crunchy and the mustard is the perfect amount.  I never got the slaw on mine.

Stewart's will also ship hot dogs on dry ice to anywhere you want, or at least they used to!

"Because I'm sure it's true at any particular program, at any particular time. They are running on usually 100% capacity with an extremely high turnover for the most part. Not to mention Covid slowed everything down.

I don't know this for fact or anything, but I suspect the pandemic also caused a slow down or suspension of movement with funds and people from the DOC to the rehabs like Recovery Point.

Others are in it for what I would call the ""right reasons"".

I know time away and the ability to speak to a therapist on a regular basis really made all the difference in the world for me.

"So Solar Holler's ""Co-op"" is a slight misnomer IMO and its biggest red flag for me. Its not a co-op as I understand it at all. Its just a group discount. . . and everyone is separate. There is no other benefit to the consumer besides a marginal discount.

In my research a co-op is a nonprofit organization; in the context of energy it is a conglomerate of individuals that pool their resources together to demand access and bargaining power to what should be public infrastructure. In this case it could use the the kW generated by the large amount of people going solar together. Which might work to make users customers of the co-op and not AEP.

For example. If a group of co-op members install a large solar installation on a large piece of land, then sell or credit the the electricity generated to the grid to its members. This would be cheaper than induvial installations. This also allows membership in the co-op to be dynamic and the organization to grow or shrink as required. People can ""buy-in"" to the co-op. That is what a co-op is to me.

With induvial installations costing more - installers like solar holler make more money with individual customers rather than installing a solar farm.",t2_bfe9s,climbonapply24head,0,1623206934.0,0,t1_h13vxxy,h13vxxy,False,climbonapply24head,t3_nvazhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nvazhn/does_anyone_know_anything_about_appalachian_power/,Does anyone know anything about Appalachian power rates and solar/battery set ups?,/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nvazhn/does_anyone_know_anything_about_appalachian_power/h13vxxy/,1,r/HuntingtonWV,0,1

"Discs are pretty cheap at Dick's Sporting Goods, or Van Man's in Huntington. Should be able to pick up a few for $10-20 each. If this is your first time I'd just buy 1-2 discs each, a mid-range and a putter, or just a mid-range (although putting will be a bit harder). You probably won't be throwing really long on your first try, so don't worry about a long range. That means when you're looking at a disc to buy you want the speed rating to be like 8 or lower.  You can't really rent discs because they get lost fairly easily.

So when you're throwing, don't try to just whip it right out the gate. You want to throw a medium strength disc as controlled as possible. If you whip it, or grip-lock, you're very likely to throw it in the woods somewhere and have to spend some time looking for your disc. A lot of your first times on the golf course will probably be time spent looking for discs, but once you figure it out you'll have a lot of fun.

If you want to practice throwing, go to the soccer field over by the bridge and throw it for a few minutes in the open field. Practice you backhand, releasing the disc flat, releasing it angled. Practice your forehand. Depending which one you throw the disc will fade at the end the opposite direction.  Throwing a disc golf disc is not like throwing a frisbee except at slow speeds.

Anyway, have fun. Enjoy spending time in the woods with someone you love. Try not to get frustrated if your discs go wild a lot, it takes some time to train your body to throw a disc the right way.",t2_5hj36,radius1214,0,1622812604.0,0,t1_h0kbd21,h0kbd21,True,Plaid_Kaleidoscope,t3_nrtlyi,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nrtlyi/disc_golf/,Disc Golf,/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nrtlyi/disc_golf/h0kbd21/,6,r/HuntingtonWV,0,6

"Beech Fork has a lot of great trails with a decent amount of Vert and views. The Mary Davis trail is about 9 miles. The Lost trail is about 3.1 or so miles. You can make a 10 mile loop by going Lost to Mary Davis to Ruben's Branch.

Barboursville Park also has a good amount of trails. They have a loop around the lake that is basically flat and a bit under a mile. The River trail which is also basically flat and is about 4 miles point to point. There are a fair amount of trails on the side of the hill there that you can stretch just about as far as you want.

Ritter Park has a nearly 1 mile loop but you can also extend the trail another 2-3 miles but continuing west on the track down to 14th St West. 

There are also a few cemeteries around that offer a reprieve from traffic that you can road run with only seeing an occasional car. These are in the southeast part of town near Fatima Church and near the Mildred Mitchel Bateman hospital.",t2_mttux,-_SFW_-,0,1622732510.0,0,t1_h0g3q26,h0g3q26,True,CluelessMedStudent,t3_nrem0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nrem0k/any_recommendations_for_running_trailspaths/,Any recommendations for running trails/paths?,/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nrem0k/any_recommendations_for_running_trailspaths/h0g3q26/,6,r/HuntingtonWV,0,6
"ritter park has a path. there's a loop that goes around the main part of the park, and there's a section that follows fourpole creek which you can take from 8th street to around the underpass at 14th St West.

you can also head in the opposite direction along enslow blvd/washington blvd, head past the baskin robbins/bp station/school, and more or less follow washington blvd until you get to where military rd, woodland dr, and washington blvd meet. there's a path between washington blvd and military rd that starts after you cross a small bridge on washington blvd that crosses the creek. you might have to travel like 1/8th of a mile on sidewalk as opposed to the actual walking/running paths.

 you'll probably have to cross the street a few times around the section between baskin robbins and the little bridge, but I wouldn't classify that as a busy road, especially not if you avoid any time people are picking up/dropping off kids en masse.

that might give you an idea. you can probably see the path from google street view. there's also a utility/maintenance road through the park that is closed to motor vehicle traffic basically all the time, so if you wanted you could kind do a figure 8 through the park. it basically cuts through the middle of the park and connects the parking lot on the 12th st side to the parking lot on the 8th st side.",t2_49ak5,buttking,0,1622732234.0,0,t1_h0g328e,h0g328e,True,CluelessMedStudent,t3_nrem0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nrem0k/any_recommendations_for_running_trailspaths/,Any recommendations for running trails/paths?,/r/HuntingtonWV/comments/nrem0k/any_recommendations_for_running_trailspaths/h0g328e/,3,r/HuntingtonWV,0,3

"Teays Valley Y has both indoor and sand leagues (not pickup) and unfortunately the registration for those two just closed. 

South Charleston used to do pickup games on Saturday mornings, but not sure those started back yet due to COVID. They also do a monthly scramble which is pretty fun. You get to play with a wide variety of people and get news on where others are playing. 

Magic Island in Charleston also has a pickup day at those sand courts but not sure the status there yet either. 

Sorry this isn't info for the Huntington area but Teays Valley isn't too far away. There's often pickup over at the sand courts at Eleanor but those are hit & miss

Oh, there's a league at Teays Valley Church of God that's about to wrap up so a new season would start soon... But it's pretty much a recreational league and may not be fun for an experienced player.

"so it looks like Thundercloud is actually going to be more of a Tier 2 ISP, so you're probably going to have to wait for an ISP that uses Thundercloud as their upstream ISP to get any benefit from the proposed fiber loop. It's probably going to be a few years. Hopefully we'll eventually get municipal broadband of some sort. my guess would be that there is a high likelihood of that because they're basically just doing the same thing on a bigger scale. then they can just set up a tier 3 ISP for every town between Huntington and Charleston. Of course, there's also the possibility that this will never materialize for any number of reasons.
