"Atheist/ Buddhist here who got involved and has been clean 10 years through NA. The choice of higher power is yours UNEQUIVOCALLY! You can believe in the power of the group, or in the lineage of people passing down healing, or simply in love or the human spirit. People will talk about God and Jesus, that works for them! It’s never supposed to be coercive or prescriptive. I get that the books were written in a time and place where Christianity is dominant, but all you have to do is plug in your higher power of choice or your atheistic belief In humanity when someone says God or it’s in the book. I recommend NA, it has a wide open umbrella for all addictions, including alcohol.
That said the NA hall is a little wild and woolly. Check out the Monday night Spiritual Reality meeting and Thursdays’ Daily Applications of Spiritual Principles meeting.

Every homeless proposal provides housing to like 50 homeless people so we just need 200 of those proposals and homelessness should be fixed in Chico.

The problem though is most of the homeless people in Chico are homeless because of a crippling mental illness or addiction... or both. If you don't treat that along with providing dignified housing, you really aren't doing anything in the long run.

"How do you think it is supposed to improve? The process of renting an apartment involves application fees, credit checks and usually a co-signer. If you make it over those hurdles you can pay $1300 for a 2 bd 1 bath apartment as long as you have the first month's rent and a deposit and want to sign a year lease. Also, some property management places will make you renew your lease in October even though you signed/moved in in July so if your life changes in April (like when a pandemic cancelled school) too bad, you already committed to another year way before your original lease ended.

"Yeah, that's a hard one. I have found the best way to go is Amtrak. The thing about Amtrak is that the train only heads south from Chico at 4 AM and north from Sac at midnight. The good news is that their bus service is pretty frequent, maybe 5 times a day. The catch is though that to get a bus ticket you have to also buy a train ticket. It's only $11 per way for either the train or the bus. Sometimes when I need to, I just buy two separate trips, forfeiting the cost of two train rides, totaling $44 overall. That is still about the same price as a round trip for greyhound which is both lower quality and a bit sketchy at times. Amtrak has been a great experience for me so far. Their buses have a pair of tables in the back of the bus and charging outlets. 

&#x200B;

The only issue with either of these bus services is that it's about another $20-$30 uber to get from their terminals to the airport......",t2_ysgvf,SEA___BEAR,0,1647455422.0,0,t1_i0wznl3,i0wznl3,True,itsalwayssunny10,t3_tfoebk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/tfoebk/travel_to_sacramento/,Travel to Sacramento,/r/ChicoCA/comments/tfoebk/travel_to_sacramento/i0wznl3/,16,r/ChicoCA,0,16

"That's correct in that there is no law making public nudity illegal. However if you're in plain view of others the cops can enforce various laws like indecent exposure on a complaint basis. This was all told to me by a park ranger while skinny dipping in the park. So the rules are very much based on the judgment of the law enforcement as to whether you're in plain view. Some where secluded with no other people is technically fine. But what the other commenter said is also correct in that you need to keep an eye out for any people especially kids approaching. People get real mad about nudity around kids.

The markup on mattresses is huge.  Most traditional mattresses are unbelievably expensive.  My husband and I chose to order a “bed in a box”.  Which means you need to do a lot of on-line research.

"Here is some information/thoughts you didn't ask for, and I apologize ahead of time if some of it isn't your jam or jelly.

  
I agree with another commenter wrote about maybe looking into Durham. It's a 15 - 20 minute drive depending on where in town you live to Chico State, small town, has access to the highway, no complaints about it whatsoever besides being a little Podunk. 

You might also might want to consider Paradise as an option, especially (I hate saying this) if you're looking to buy instead of rent. This is strictly speculation as I haven't looked into the housing/renting market there since before the fire, but I'm assuming--someone correct me if I'm wrong--homes and lots are a buyer's market due to the Camp Fire. Though it could also be the inverse. Still! Something you might want to look into, Paradise is also 20ish minutes to Chico depending on where in Paradise. And it's elevated with lots of pine and trees and if you go high enough during Winter you get snow, which you don't in Chico. I mean... Paradise is still rebuilding itself as well and I don't know what the community is like, so keep that in mind if you do give it a looksie. 

It wasn't asked, but Chico has a ton of culture. I grew up in Fresno which has lots of drugs, gangs, violence and hard-liner, far-Right conservatives. But there's this little bitty area called the Tower District that's a bastion of culture: My favorite coffee shop was next door to a bar on one side, an Italian delicatessen on the other. Across the street from the coffee house was a tea shop, and next to that was an old school record store, next to that Asian-Fusion restaurant, down the road was a table-top gaming shop, and even further down the Tower Theater. I mention all that because Chico feels like the Tower District but more spread out, less condensed. There's local artists and musicians  and theaters (4-5 off the top of my head) and burlesque troupes. The regional manager of the Taco Bell I worked at gave my co-worker two weeks off to tour California with his band. That's what sells it for me, it's beautifully cultured. 

This is more of a side thing since no one else mentioned it--and forget it if it's not your thing! There isn't a huge kink community here, but the one we do have is incredibly friendly and welcoming. Wonderful and wonderfully open-minded people if you know how to look for them.

Drugs is a thing here, but it's more party drugs for college students. I mentioned Oroville having meth? We have weed and mushrooms (some cocaine? Not my thing), and it's not in as much quantity as Oroville (or Fresno, geez).

Fun fact, Kyle Gas did a show here with his band Trainwreck and he signed my new leather jacket. With a silver sharpie. By drawing a big doodle of his face. And the leader singer of the band talked mad smack on Fresno, I'm a big fan.

There's a dog park north of town (also more ritzy, very nice neighborhood(s)), so if you have puppers or plan to have some, there's an easy place to socialize them and take them for a treat :)

For almost half the year we have what we call Thursday Night Farmer's Market, which is separate from the really nice Farmer's Market we have Saturday mornings year round. A large area of downtown is sectioned off near the plaza for local businesses, organizations, food trucks (omg the food trucks), artists, craftspersons, gardners and farmers to sell and show their wares/organization's things. There've been plant sellers, jewelers, speed painters, impromptu shows, planned musical performers, and there's always spots reserved along the ""causeways"" for musicians to sing and play and jam out. Thursday Night Market is one of the best things about this place. Here's an old link about last year's Market: [https://www.downtownchico.com/event-thursday-night-market\_16.htm](https://www.downtownchico.com/event-thursday-night-market_16.htm)

I'll end it by disclaiming that while I've traveled across the country and then some, I've only ever lived in California (besides a few months-long stints in NY and out of country), and then only ever in Fresno and Chico. 

So my Tl;dr is, Chico is a fine town with a lot of flaws and I think you'll be happy here, family and all. 

I'm very open to anyone correcting me if I got any of my information wrong. It's late and I'm bushed.",t2_3d3gw7px,MattDickInABox,0,1646483884.0,0,t1_hzg1wvk,hzg1wvk,False,dlugosac,t3_su2d12,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/su2d12/seeking_recent_advice_on_chico_as_new_home/,Seeking recent advice on Chico as new home.,/r/ChicoCA/comments/su2d12/seeking_recent_advice_on_chico_as_new_home/hzg1wvk/,3,r/ChicoCA,0,3
"Hi there! I've been in Chico for about 10 years cumulatively. Came here for college, never really left. In fact the whole family moved up here, and we've been pretty happy ever since. I do want to move eventually, but that's partly because I feel like I'm still very young (your age) and haven't seen enough of the world to know where to plant roots. This place became my second hometown, and I personally feel like I need to leave my hometown eventually.  
  
That said, it ain't perfect. A lot of people have had problems I've somehow avoided, like those that have been posted here, and I've heard enough from friends to second-hand corroborate the stories. I'll try to answer your questions, then throw in miscellaneous input.  
  
*1. How is Chico for raising a family (schools, community)?*  
For a couple years I helped raise my niece while her parents lived with us, she was somewhere in 1st - 3rd grade at the time. I know that she loved her school and friends, and especially her teacher. I've only heard good things about the teaching community and non-college schools in town, and I can only speak for our little apartment complex, she got along phenomenally with the neighbor kids. The community as a whole is a good one. Like someone else wrote, it's a lot more politically Left than the rest of the county, which for me is a positive. What's more of a positive though is that I've found more people who are Right-wing that are open to friendly discussion and debate than anywhere else I've been, and I've a few friends who vote that way (generally). People of either side of the aisle who can speak their differences and even change each others' minds is a very good sign to me. Oh, also! If you're the \[Christian\] religious sort, I've been to a couple churches and I've enjoyed my Sundays there. Somewhat related, if you're part or supportive of the LGBT community, Chico is generally very welcoming. Very strong Stonewall presence. Churches made me think of it because Lutheran First here in Chico is very LGBT+ friendly.  
  
*2. Is Chico’s crime/homeless situation improving?*  
Yes and no? Maybe? The last time I checked bike theft was the number one crime here, but I've heard plenty of stories of auto break-ins (not many of home burglaries). Had one happen to myself, but I was the dingus who left the door unlocked on a side street around the corner from any housing. The homeless situation *is* worsening. I haven't heard a story about homeless development that wasn't negative, whether it's increased homelessness or the city doing something real shitty as policy to them. As an example, the city shut the only recycling center in town that paid CRV for cans, bottles, other recyclables. This hurts personally because I have a family member who makes a full-time job of collecting recyclables to pay rent for his apartment and this development made it so much harder for him to keep a stable income to pay legitimate bills. I think it was meant to incentivize the homeless to leave for somewhere else, but the result is grifters are buying cans at half value or charging (in my guy's case) very high prices to take them to the nearest recycling centers (Oroville, maybe Orland?). Sorry, that was a tangent. Gets my goat. Chico PD is a mixed bag, some are good, some are great, some are crap. On St. Patrick's Day (much celebrated holiday) in 2017, a police officer tased, shot, and killed an unarmed black man named Desmond Phillips during a mental health episode. Links from the local reputable newspaper, Chico News and Review (CN&R), are linked below. Oroville PD, weirdly for all the jokes we make about the town being more methed out than ours, I've only heard outstandingly good things. California Highway Patrol gave me a ride home once when I was caught illegally biking from Oroville to Chico (bought the bike in Oro, busses stopped running, no car, much younger) instead of giving me a ticket or arresting me. Major point in their favor, but I'm biased.

https://www.newsreview.com/chico/content/phillips-case-closed/28511926/  
  
*3. What neighborhoods should I check out as potential places to live?*  
What we call the Aves has a bad reputation from 10 - 20 years ago when violent crime was much higher. The fact is I've spent most of my time in Chico living in that area and haven't ever had a problem. It's on the other side of Chico State from downtown (avoid living downtown for family life), but the further you get from campus the less you'll be bothered by parties and such. Otherwise rent has been relatively cheap, there are some *really* nice houses if you can find one for rent/sale. Best place I've ever lived (not with family) was in the Aves. Overall a cautious thumbs up.  
The ritzier parts of town are definitely southeast near the 20th Street and Skyway freeway exits. There's more urban development/city expansion happening in that area both residential and commercial, not to mention some remote suburbs. Were I affluent enough (and couldn't find a really nice old house off the edges of downtown (for myself, not a fan for families)), somewhere between 20th and Skyway is where I'd want to live.  
Really the only places I'd tell you to avoid living in is the immediate Downtown Chico area due to great amounts of college students and homeless-- there is a very active nightlife, especially when school is in session (sidenote: town gets pretty quiet during college vacations).

"Adecco (temp agency) has been really good to me and I highly recommend them. Gotten a handful of jobs from them, and one ***really*** sweet gig. It was supposed to be a temp job, but it lasted for 8 months instead of 1, and I would have been hired on in a full-time managerial position if the work location they assigned me to didn't close down. This is *probably* the exception, but it was possible through Adecco.

*However*, if you're open to working for DoorDash or GrubHub, GrubHub's wait list is very short whereas DoorDash's waitlist is huge.

***However,*** if you select your starting market in DoorDash to be in a different zip than Chico, you might be able to start up right away. Starting market does not mean you have to deliver there, DoorDash lets you deliver in any area you're geographically in. ***If*** the zip code you select as your starting market has a waitlist, you can reach out to DoorDash driver support (Driver Care) on the app, text chat with a support worker, and request your starting market be somewhere without a waitlist.

"From the article:

""SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California’s governor proposed a plan Thursday to offer more services to homeless people with severe mental health and addiction disorders even if that means compelling some into care, a move that many advocates of homeless people oppose as a violation of civil rights.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said at a press conference that he has no intention of rounding people up and locking them away. Instead, he said his plan would offer a way for people to get court-ordered psychiatric treatment, medication and housing, preferably before they are arrested.

Under the plan, which requires approval by the Legislature, all counties would have to set up a mental health branch in civil court and provide comprehensive and community-based treatment to those suffering from debilitating psychosis. People need not be homeless to be evaluated by a court.

But if approved, they would be obligated to accept the care or risk criminal charges, if those are pending, and if not, they would be subject to being held in psychiatric programs involuntarily or lengthier conservatorships in which the court appoints a person to make health decisions for someone who cannot""",t2_kflwb,Tavli,0,1646349664.0,0,t1_hz8x1ou,hz8x1ou,True,Tavli,t3_t64gyn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/t64gyn/gov_newsom_proposes_new_plan_to_force_some/,Gov.

"But, yea, no - you don't want to do that counsel thing right now...it's a fucking shitshow, no it's the American Horror Shitshow. Also, the whole recycling center drama is kinda shitty as well. There used to be one on 20th St, but it had been spluging gross chemicals all over the neighborhood for decades and it was not great.

There **IS** money, it's just not placed very well throughout the city projects and the planners, and counsel, and basically everyone in charge are a bunch of cronies. They did provide a potty and a wash station for a few months at the beginning of the pandemic, it was in the parking lot where the farmers market occurs, but apparently it was too much effort so they took it out.

Around 15K of those people are from the Camp Fire, and around a forth or fifth of those people had nowhere else to go so they ended up homeless in shelters, Rvs and tents. We're just not a small town anymore and we need infrastructure for 100k people plus a homeless population.

...If it makes you feel any better I delivered pizza in multiple cities, and nowhere else but Chico did I have so many issues with people, it's not just you.

"> As far as keeping it dry, it's not any harder than PLA.

I don't try to keep PLA dry though...its literally in my closet.

With PETG if I don't dry it in the oven I get bad quality prints. But once its dry its good for like a day or so before flaws start creeping in.

Actually printing PETG is easy...much better than ABS IMO.  

Its just that I have a spool of PETG on hand specifically for structural prints but its not my main thing",t2_3snly,Renovatio_,0,1646271429.0,0,t1_hz4kxvx,hz4kxvx,False,vestedaf,t3_t4isti,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/t4isti/3d_printing/,3D Printing,/r/ChicoCA/comments/t4isti/3d_printing/hz4kxvx/,2,r/ChicoCA,0,2
"As far as keeping it dry, it's not any harder than PLA. I literally don't do anything different than I did before swapping. PETG has some properties that I like a bit better. It has a slightly higher glass transition point, it handles weathering better, and tends to be a bit stronger than PLA.

I sometimes need PETG instead of PLA. The price different between PETG and PLA is basically non-existent. Once dialed in, PETG isn't actually any harder to print than PLA, and going back and forth is a pain. The only thing I really miss about PLA is the extra color choices that seem to be available and the faster print times. All that said, I'm not a commercial printer so whether something takes 12 hours or 24 hours isn't really a huge different to me, and stuff doesn't melt in my car in the Summer.",t2_bzu20,CageyRabbit,0,1646269777.0,0,t1_hz4hkpm,hz4hkpm,False,vestedaf,t3_t4isti,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChicoCA/comments/t4isti/3d_printing/,3D Printing,/r/ChicoCA/comments/t4isti/3d_printing/hz4hkpm/,1,r/ChicoCA,0,1
