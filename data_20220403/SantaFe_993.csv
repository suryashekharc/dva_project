Cerillos Hills State Park is pretty cool if you like hiking in the desert instead of the forest mountains. It's about 30 minutes south of Santa fe. There are several nice scenic trails.

"Ok, not worth engaging with you anymore after this since you apparently like reading and critical thinking skills but here it goes. 

NEW YORK CITY has infinitely more resources than Santa Fe does for unhoused people to access in colder months. Also, I'm sorry the climate is not nearly as harsh. I never said this was a case of just people getting priced out an ending up on the street. These are complex issues stemming from a variety of areas including mental health addiction etc, cost of living is just one facet. 

For example if addiction counselors, social workers etc. can't afford to live in Santa Fe there is no one to provide those services. High property costs can prevent the building of transitional housing etc. 

*That said, when people are priced out of a market they don’t become homeless. They leave.* 

It is incredible privileged to say this and shows a real lack of understanding of true poverty. Also, there's a point when the prices get driven up everywhere so that there is no where else for people to go. 

Sure unhoused people may choose to leave large Cali cities due to violence etc. but I just don't see why Santa Fe would be the first, second or even third choice for most due to a climate and general lack of  services. 

I'm sure some unhoused people have come here from Cali for various reasons. I'm sure some marginalized  people have come here from Cali trying to get on their feet and ended up unhoused. But I do not think that it is a major source of the issue in Santa Fe.

"If you hadn’t heard, there is a huge homeless population in NYC. And the winters there are a lot worse than in Santa Fe. The argument that homeless people won’t travel to a cooler place is a false premise.

That said, when people are priced out of a market they don’t become homeless. They leave.

This 'oh, they're just bums coming in from California' argument is a nice smoke screen to help avoid the reality that there are real problems in this community that are affecting this community, that people in New Mexico are getting pushed to fringes.

Haven't tried Craft but I've heard great things.

Dunkin is the classic but only for CERTAIN THINGS. Ie, their toasted coconut or jelly and the boiling hot coffee.

Whoo's is fancy and good, but a little overpriced and the people there can be a little weird.

"I don't think Millennials will move to New Mexico in general. There's not enough good-paying entry-level or early career jobs.

I love New Mexico but it's generally a poor state. Pretty state, interesting state, a few very cool towns, but generally impoverished and lacking a strong economy. And the schools aren't great, which is a big factor for families and people who are about to start families. It's like the West Virginia of the southwest, but more diverse.

It seems like Santa Fe has been a retirement and arts destination for a few generations now. I am not sure how a town of Santa Fe's size breaks out of that mold.

The only way I see New Mexico changing is if all other areas out west get too pricey, and Albuquerque becomes the last affordable major metropolitan area west of the great plains. This would have an effect on Santa Fe as well.

Also, deserts aren't for everyone.

"$2500 - 3 bedroom, 3 bath house (about 2500 square feet) with a separate unit attached on the back. Shared fenced backyard with other unit. 

It is kind of a POS. No cooling on first floor and no heating on top floor. Top floor has ranged in temperature from 34 degrees to 97 degrees F. We had to provide our own washer and dryer in a shitty shed in the back that has to be heated in the winter to prevent freezing pipes. There is one counter in the kitchen. No oven hood. Mice problem.

We are moving out in May. Landlord is increasing the rent to $5k. I pity whoever rents it for that price.

EDIT: I think $2500 is fair. I think the new rate is outrageous.

"The problem is rampant counterfeit native pottery and jewelry in many of the shops in the more touristy areas. One of the largest families involved, who owned shops here in Santa Fe as well as Gallup and Albuquerque were finally prosecuted following a raid in the fall of 2015.  Five members of the Aysheh family were indicted on federal charges in 2017 and one, Imad Aysheh went into hiding but was finally arrested in 2019. They manufactured items in Imad's sweatshop in the Phillippines and sold them here as authentic native ware.

The belief (rumors?) are that the shops simply changed ownership on paper but the same business practices continue. I have personally never bought from any of the ones on or near the plaza.

Authentic pottery is going to be expensive.

"It was actually a great place to be a teen in the 90s. When I left I found that I had a much more diverse set of experiences than so many other people at my college. There are so few places where you can grow up with all of the following in one place: tons of outdoor recreation and wilderness; seriously top flight food, art, and cosmopolitan culture; a majority non-white population; a substantial indigenous population; world class science and research institutions; and less than 100k people. 

For me, I felt like I got a little bit of everything. Smoking weed on the plaza (great drugs around generally), music at the railyard (which was dingy little building that hosted all ages punk/alternative shows), lectures on chaos theory from the Santa Fe institute or photojournalism at the photo workshops, late night coffee shops and diners (RIP Carrows), hanging out in the desert chilling with friends, driving too fast on empty roads, house parties, hot springs in the Jemez, and lots of hiking and camping in the Sangres, Abiquiu, and tent rocks. 

Plus, you know, just the strangeness of Santa Fe…like when a kid everyone swears they knew slammed into the portal on the palace of the governors and the thing collapsed (he was fine), watching Zozobra get super regulated after a guy got shot, having a whole high school class devoted to debunking new age stuff, and learning to drive when you’re 13-14 (is that still the age here?

Mine Shaft has live music every weekend in Madrid, I drive from ABQ to there to gig.

Edit: I’ve played music for a Santa Fe art pop up, they usually set up somewhere new every month. Also I hear Cowgirl is where to go for live music in Santa Fe right now.

"Sorry you’re getting this response here, I guess folks got burrs in their saddle. You can find country here and there across Santa Fe, mostly as live music and just once in a while. As other said, the scene here leaves much to be desired. Bars in general are sparse, much less country bars. But check out Lost Padre Records and talk to George. He’s putting on all sorts of live music this year, country included. He had Willi Carlisle and Dylan Earl out in recent months. Charlie Crockett on the plaza last year. Years ago he had Earl Poole Ball (longtime Johnny Cash pianist / played with Graham Parsons and a whole bunch of other country greats). All of this is less your pop country Jason Aldean types and more classic country sounds, so hopefully that gets your goat",t2_6k7l8,moonkiller,0,1648434282.0,0,t1_i2e1k1j,i2e1k1j,True,freeagent2120,t3_tpd2h3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaFe/comments/tpd2h3/country_bars/,Country Bars,/r/SantaFe/comments/tpd2h3/country_bars/i2e1k1j/,3,r/SantaFe,0,3

For Meow Wolf their previous CEO and some of their head employees are making more than most folks in Santa Fe.

But that doesn't mean there aren't people who make up staff working at LANL or MW who are making way less than this. Also there's the matter of MW furloughing/laying off 250 employees during the pandemic. Many of whom were not making a lot of money and lost out on steady income.

Essentially, new investors come in (probably a lot of the wealthy people that have flocked there in the past decade or so) to buy, build, sell, and own (in a commercial sense more often than not) land as a passive investment. It’s a symbiotic relationship between wealth and government. They need each other.

Also, the biggest generation to ever retire is in its retirement heyday right now. Baby boomers are wealthy, fiscally responsible, technologically competent, and a lot of them want peace and quiet. You tend to get that in a place like SF. If you notice, even the businesses and restaurants cater to this demographic.",t2_2s327aat,BeeeEazy,0,1648256925.0,0,t1_i251lu2,i251lu2,True,purplgrapes,t3_tnz1sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaFe/comments/tnz1sk/why_is_gentrification_such_a_hidden_thing_here/,Why is gentrification such a hidden thing here?,/r/SantaFe/comments/tnz1sk/why_is_gentrification_such_a_hidden_thing_here/i251lu2/,6,r/SantaFe,0,6

"Not so relevant to your interests but the Ukranian Xmas egg shop in the plaza area is really neat! There's another Christmas shop across the street that's also great and has NM ornaments. 

Go try some birria tacos at Fusion Tacos (it's a truck). One of their trucks is well within walking distance of the plaza. Someone else also mentioned Burro Alley; the Mexican restaurant there has a guy that plays piano on Fridays and Saturdays starting at 6. If you're visiting with other people that's a fun time. 

When you do go to Museum Hill, stop by the cafe if you're a coffee drinker. There are a few places around town with good Mexican/Aztec coffee and hot chocolate and that's one of them. The place is sort of like a coffee shop/restaurant combo so don't be thrown off by people sitting around and ordering at tables. Also make sure that you give yourself plenty of time here. Don't think you're gonna spend an hour or so and be done. The folk-art museum takes me forever to go through because it's just too good. 

I would make time to go to the Bandelier National Monument. The murals and everything are just awesome. Don't skip it. If you realize that's your favorite part of the trip so far you might want to go ahead and drive thru the Jemez. and go to the Jemez Historic Site. The whole drive is just gorgeous. With what you wrote I would say Bandelier is probably going to be a favorite.

"Im no expert, so take my opinions with a grain of salt...but I don't think it's politics.  and Santa Fe doesn't really have an industry...tourism is the driver. I do think the influx of folks bc of covid has for sure affected housing costs. me & SO are transplants from Long Beach, CA. although we purchased our home July 2019, we didn't intend on living here FT for another 5-7 years. but my SO was given 'early retirement' aka fired. it was quite the blow financially so we sold our home LB and moved here FT August 2020.  *but* I was born in ABQ so I feel like I'm coming home. we love Santa Fe. I volunteer as a tutor with SF public schools. I am active with a group that is trying to stop the city from taking back a large parcel of land that was purchased through a bond years ago for a park. they want to sell it to a developer to build single family homes. which of course will raise housing in that area. and also impact the inadequate streets, etc. it's a farce. the city council, well,, let's just say my respect is low..anyway, i take classes at the CC. we shop at the farmers market exclusively during the height of the growing season. we frequent a local co-op and farm (Reunity Resources, awesome veggies!)

all that to say we buy locally as much as possible and try to be good stewards of the fine little city that is Santa Fe.  generally speaking long time residents don't have a favorable opinion  of transplants. I get it but it's practically impossible to stop progress if the local powers that be are driven by, no surprise, money. and apathy is a factor as well

(Mad-rid, not Mah-drid) it's an easy drive, again beautiful terrain as you get close to Madrid, which is a funky little hamlet. lots of photo ops.

"You might also look at Zillow. 

I love Santa Fe and I want to move back. I only haven’t because my kids are happy where we are. That said, there is gang and drug issues in Santa Fe. If the review says shootings, believe it. 

Somewhere online there is a tool that shows crime reports by neighborhood. 

Personally, I really like the Casa Solana neighborhood. It’s a bit mid range on price and very family oriented. The nearby school, Gonzales is a local favorite and people will transfer their kids out of other schools and into Gonzales. 

You might find a Casita on the East Side or Hyde Park road. 

South Capitol is also a great place - again more likely to be a casita than an apartment complex. 

There were some condominiums on Zia that I liked. 

Some of those might be available for rentals. I also love the area around Museum Hill. 

Those areas might be more expensive but less other issues to worry about. 

And you might get lucky with a good deal. 

There are also good rentals all over town. I’ve got friends that live off of Jaguar Drive and they had beautiful safe houses. I’m actually jealous sitting in my expensive California apartment.

Yes that sounds right- SW side of town by Target.

I don't have kids and I'm looking for a 1 bed/studio that's safe but as affordable as possible (which ik will be well over $1000/mo).  I'm 30, female, single, and have spent the past decade in an extremely safe, small city.

All of the large appt complexes I've looked into just have extremely mixed reviews, so it's hard to know what to believe.  San Isidro has many saying it's great to live there and management is wonderful.  Then there are a few that claim diff things like it's not up to code, management is terrible, or the gate is broken so robbery is bad.  One even mentioned shootings.

"Ask if this ""approval fee"" is an application fee (Not the background check fee, which is different). New Mexico does not set a limit on what landlords can charge for an application fee and they are non-refundable.  You're arriving at a time when rents have nearly doubled, if not tripled, here in the last 3 years so landlords are getting away with huge fees.

In any event, contact the city's tenant resources and ask them if you want true guidance.

I’ve run a lot of large scale music festivals, and the break even for a lineup like that would probably be in the ballpark of around 5,000-7,500 3-day passes sold in advance. It doesn’t sound like that many tickets, but it actually is at $300/ticket for a first year festival. Festivals are almost always completely mismanaged in the first year or two. It’s a retiree town, and they booked NWA and Wu-Tang…? The show needed to be advertised nationally, or at least semi-nationally. People will fly in and drive overnight from all over the country for bills like that. Just like any other business, festivals should expect and have accounted for significant losses for the first 4-5 years. It’s very rare for a new festival to turn any profit at all in the first year or two. The first time you break even calls for a champagne toast. 

Camping passes are more often than not just to offset the cost of renting the land and proper licensing. Sometimes festival grounds will require that camping passes are an additional revenue stream for whomever owns the property (becoming more and more common actually) because it wreaks havoc on the land.",t2_2s327aat,BeeeEazy,0,1647896778.0,0,t1_i1kvvlt,i1kvvlt,False,__never_more_,t3_tjd7n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaFe/comments/tjd7n9/santa_fe_literary_festival_so_excited_and_then_so/,Santa Fe Literary Festival: so excited and then so disappointed.

"For sure, I know it's complex. I'm not trying to troll, just thinking big picture. 

Sometimes I just wonder...at what point does someone become ""local""? This could be applied anywhere. The Spanish conquistadors probably weren't considered locals by the Pueblo people centuries ago. Just like the English weren't when they went to conquer Ireland.

All the transplants coming now, if they theoretically stay, would their descendants in 400 years be locals? I would think, but the version of Santa Fe local then could be quite different.

That could buy so MANY books to read from somewhere like Opcit!
Does this include some sort of hotel fee or meal plan?
Might be worth dressing up as a book and protesting outside the event.

"Honestly I kinda disagree. 

The crazy expensive pass is a ticket to 21 events, including 21 books, multiple provided meals, and multiple Santa Fe excursions, which are probably things as locals we can do on our own time. It's about the same cost as when I go to a conference for work, with the same amount provided. They aren't aiming to be affordable. 

The regular event tickets are $75 with a book included, *and* there's a $25 discount for New Mexico residents. If you don't want the book it's $50. I think $50 to meet an author, listen to a reading, get a signed book and have a conversation or Q&A with them isn't too bad.
