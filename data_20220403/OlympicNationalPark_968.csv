You can look at previous year's trip reports to see if they're free.

Not sure how far you want to hike, but 27 miles (round trip) up the East Fork Quinault is the Enchanted Valley. It's amazing.

"Alright so typically you have snow cover up in the 6k elevation range in June. That may not be the case this year, but it's good to keep in mind.
You do not need crampons for most snow travel, you can snag some micro spikes and you would be totally fine. But a lot of Olympic is below 5 k. The paradise entrance for Ranier has a spot in Longmire where you can rent snow shoes.
Ranier 
Reflection lakes
Panorama point
Mowich lake 
All pretty easy hikes but you can really look at any of the trails in the wonderland loop and be pretty well off.
As for Olympic, hit the beaches at least one of the days, third beach is my favorite and the tree of life won't be around for much longer so swing by it.
Mt storm king is classic
Mt Townsend has great views

"Recommendations depend a lot on what time of year you'll be there.  The following advice assumes summer weather.

It's a *loooong* drive from Seattle to even the closest access of Olympic National Park.  Highly recommend getting a hotel for a night on the Olympic Peninsula so that you can spend more time exploring and less time driving. Otherwise, you'll spend 7 hours in the car to see 2 hours of forest.

Port Angeles is your best base-camp city.

Recommended adventures:

* Drive up to Hurricane Ridge, hike Hurricane Hill. Great views deep into the ONP wilderness.
* Visit tidepools at [Salt Creek Recreation Area](https://goo.gl/maps/jrso6NFCApH8bfnDA). (Car camping, too.)
* Grab a meal at historic Lake Crescent Lodge. Hike to Marymare Falls. If time (and fitness) allow, hike to the top of Mt. Storm King.

"Hi there,

The recreation.gov site isn’t always the most clear. That refers to camping in Olympic National Park’s reservable campgrounds, which are only open to reservation during the summer. There are several campgrounds that are open year round, but you can only obtain a site in-person at a first come, first serve basis, so they aren’t listed on recreation.gov. More info and the current status of the campgrounds are in easier to find on the NPS website for ONP.

"There are a number of free dnr campgrounds on the west side of the park. Minnie Peterson campground is right near the Hoh. I was the only one camping there on Sat night so it's not too crowded in the winter. I think Mora near the beach is open now as well. There's also Bear Creek near Sol Duc. I've stayed at Potlatch in the SE corner of the park off season as well I believe. There's also the Dungeness recreation area in Sequim in the park with the Dungeness spit and Sequim Bay State Park right near the access road to the Upper Dungeness/NE corner of the park. There are lots of options depending on what part of the park you are trying to visit. Also check Kalaloch and the various campgrounds in the Quinault Valley.

"You can’t go wrong with either. 

Blue Mountain (Deer Park road) has great views and a relatively short (~3 mile) loop hike. Deer Park campground has very limited services, does not take reservations, and is very small. 

Obstruction Point (Hurricane Ridge Road) has better/longer/advanced day hike options. It’s also nearby the justifiably popular Hurricane Ridge area. 

My take: 
- if you want to camp and it’s not a weekend, go to Deer Park / Blue Mountain.
- if you want to camp and it *is a weekend* you’re SOL for getting camping at Deer Park. Camp at Dungeness Rec Area or Salt Creek.
- if you want a more challenging day hike go to Obstruction Point/Hurricane Ridge. 
- if you go during a holiday weekend during peak season, expect parking to be a disaster everywhere. Get an early start. 
- you can’t go wrong between these two options on a sunny day.

"Travel time is the least of my worries tbh so I’m only staying in Port Angeles the 5 days I’m there. Port Angeles is an hour and some change from Rialto/Ruby beach and an hour 45 from Hoh Rainforest. Pretty much every other really notable hike like Mt. Storm King, Hurricane Ridge, Mount Angeles, etc. is like half an hour from Port Angeles. If you plan on putting a major focus on the beach and on the rainforest, stay in Forks on the western side of the Olympic peninsula. Or if you wanna split it up stay at both. Otherwise, I would recommend just staying in port Angeles. If you’re using Airbnb, you’ll also get significant discounts on a stay of a week or more with most bookings. Even if it’s a little further from the beaches and rainforests, Port Angeles is the true gateway into the park and as long as driving a little bit to get to the beach and rainforests a couple days isn’t an issue, I’d recommend just staying there the whole time :)",t2_7wn11651,Hersey12,0,1646005786.0,0,t1_hyplmss,hyplmss,False,Hersey12,t3_sdir5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/sdir5k/trip_in_aprilmay/,Trip in April/May,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/sdir5k/trip_in_aprilmay/hyplmss/,2,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,2

"It just seems fishy that Heart and Lunch Lake would be so coveted by people on week-long trips. If there's a bunch of people passing through from Hoh to Appleton or something, I'd expect some other sites to be picked up days in advance too, but they aren't. Hoh Lake in particular has much more availability than Heart or Lunch Lake despite having fewer sites available and being more central to a long route. Are there a lot of people who just spend seven days doing the loop? And also would much rather stay multiple days at Heart Lake but skip Rocky Creek? 

I think the Canyon Creek and Sol Duc river spots were the farthest I saw available at the moment they were released yesterday, but maybe I took too long figuring out my alternative and missed one. Looking at tomorrow now, Rocky Creek and Deer Lake are the best available; Sol Duc Park and Crossing are already booked out to day after tomorrow.

">Ideally, our backpacking clients coordinate a shuttle at the beginning of their trip, where they park and are picked up at their ending trailhead and dropped off at their starting trailhead to start their trek. This allows our backpackers to hike back to their vehicle at their own pace, without worrying about timing a multi-day hiking exit with a fixed shuttle time slot. We always say it’s easier to drive to a meet-up location versus hiking to it on time.

"People with multi-day itineraries will have access to them first. If you, for example, go to the Hoh wilderness permits that opened today (i.e. Aug 9) and click on Olympus Guard Station, you'll see that it opens up Aug 10th's permits for several other locations. This is despite them not being available if you wanted to reserver *just* for Aug 10th. So that might be part of the reason why you can't get one for heart lake -- all of them are already taken by people coming in from other, connected parts of the park (or people staying multiple nights). 

Can people take advantage of this and no-show/overbook? Yes. Don't be that guy. But I use this feature to see (before the sites are released for the day) which sites I will even be able to book.

"I'm a bit biased because I'm not really into beach camping. I haven't backpacked the coast. 

Sol Duc to Hoh is an epic hike. As is Royal Lake. Both of those will be a *lot* more strenuous than Enchanted Valley (unless you choose to go up Anderson Pass). Beach hiking is kind of it's own entity; strenuous in that you're often doing more climbing than anticipated and working against the tide clock.

With Sol Duc-Hoh, you've got shuttle logistics to deal with, versus Royal Lake or Enchanted Valley which are out and back. Royal Lake is a lot more elevation than Enchanted Valley, but the historic chalet is worth trying to visit before it falls into the river. Also the Quinault is a lot more interesting in a wider nature tourist-y sense than the upper Dungeness. 

So if I was in your place I'd probably do Sol Duc - Hoh and Enchanted Valley and day-trip the coast. This puts your hikes all on the western side of the peninsula, which would make travel time a little easier.

Eta: make a couple short side trips to see the absolutely monstrous sitka spruce just past the Queets campground, and the Nolan Creek/Duncan cedar near Oil City. And if you're in the Quinault, the big sitka spruce. The short loop at the ranger station is great, too.

"That's the problem. The tides in August are relatively unfavorable for getting past Diamond Rock near Jefferson Cove. The NPS site states a 2' tide at most. And based on my research into tide charts for this year, that's only happening in the middle of the night in August (for the most part).

Is Hall of Mosses very similar to what will be seen along the hike to Olympus? If so, yea, I don't see any harm in skipping it.

Is hiking down to Oil City easier though from a planning perspective? I feel like the most tide-dependent pass is near Oil City (Diamond Rock).

"Hi there!

My wife and I took an extremely similar to that in the early-mid May last year to see all 3 parks, so I'm happy to offer some insight. It was a fantastic trip and I hope that you enjoy it too.

North Cascades - This was our first stop. At the time, the park was offering minimal resources. The visitor center was not open or staffed. Bathrooms were open and information was posted but that's about it. No rangers or shops. The same for the small town of Newhalem; the general store and restaurant were both closed. There were closures due to COVID but also, North Cascades is mostly shut down until Memorial day. The main highway (20) to see the entire park will likely still be closed at in April/May as well, so you'd only be able to see the west side. This isn't to dissuade you from going, just wanted to make you aware. We are so glad that we went and it's a gorgeous area. I would recommend the Thunder Knob Trail, Trail of Cedars, and Diablo Lake overlook.

Olympic - Hurricane Ridge is going to be mostly snow. The Hurricane Ridge visitor center will likely be staffed and open for warming, but probably won't have concessions. The view is great and you can definitely climb up the snowy hills for fun but there isn't much hiking at that time of year. To get to the Hurricane hill trail, we had to walk 1.5 miles down the plowed road and then got to the trail which was snow buried. You probably could've did the whole trail with cramp-ons if you're snow hiking experienced, but I only would've gone more than a few hundred yards if I had snow shows.

If your staying 5 days, I would recommend exchanging at least one of your Port Angeles nights for a night in Forks. It's a cute little town and it would save you time driving back to PA when seeing the more western locations like Rialto, Hoh, Sol Duc, etc. For Rialto, the hike to hole in the wall is definitely worth it as long as you are sure to get there at low tide.

Rainer - All the low elevation stuff in Ashford and Longmire should be open and able to hike. But once you get higher elevation than that, it's going to be snowed over. Paradise was closed except for bathrooms. One thing I would recommend is at Longmire, drive past the staff residence and cross the suspension bridge. On that other side of the river, you get a fantastic view of the mountain. 

Sorry if that was kind of scatter shot on stuff to talk about. But if you got any other questions, feel free to ask. I know that it felt like kind of a hard trip to plan since most guides talk about the winter season or some season, not the transition.",t2_4iuwl,no_common_sense,0,1643582071.0,0,t1_huww2nh,huww2nh,True,Hersey12,t3_sdir5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/sdir5k/trip_in_aprilmay/,Trip in April/May,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/sdir5k/trip_in_aprilmay/huww2nh/,2,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,2

"Hurricane Ridge is a small, non profit, community run operation. It’s like stepping back in time. 

Weather is very volatile. On a sunny day, it’s the most beautiful ski area in America. When a blizzard hits, the Park sends everyone home early. Park regulates (and poorly plows) the road. They frequently require chains, even if you have AWD. *Do not under estimate the weather at HURRICANE Ridge*.

The skiing itself is lackluster. Two short rope tows and a long platter pull. It’s only worth going if the “Poma” platter pull is running, which requires a deeper snowpack. 

Rental shop is slim (and potentially closed this year.) concessions are limited. Unlike other ski areas, it’s *not* designed to cater to your every need. 

Finally, note that the rope tow will destroy your gloves. Locals buy cheap Kincos brand insulated leather work gloves for $30.

"Hi there, sounds like an amazing trip you're planning! Much to enjoy. I agree with most of the things u/notactutallyapanda has said and will add a few more things:

* 7 lakes basin / high divide loop is amazing, but would be quite hard to do without an overnight. I've seen people do it, but you'd need to be in excellent shape, moving fast, and pack extremely light. When I do the loop, I always do it in 3 days / 2 nights.
* The high divide / 7 lakes loop including heart lake is a minimum of 16 miles and has 5,000+ elevation gain/loss, so keep that in mind.
* Skip Marymere falls and instead go to Sol Duc falls (way better) / hotsprings, especially if you're already going to be there to try to do 7 lakes / high divide.
* The Seattle ferries can be brutal, with hours and hours of wait time common in the nicer weather months. I know you can reserve spots on the Port Townsend Ferry, but am not aware of car reservations available for the Seattle ferries. If you're flying in to Seattle anyway, you may want to consider this strategy: Take cabs/public transport while in Seattle, then walk on the ferry in Seattle to get over to the peninsula. When you walk on, you never have to wait as the cars do. Once you're on the peninsula, take a cab (Viking Cabs is great) to Poulsbo and rent a car (Enterprise). Then take that car around the peninsula. Then reverse this strategy to go back to Seattle. You will likely shave hours off your travel time by doing this.
* If you try to do High Divide / Heart lake, you're guaranteed to be hiking at least 16 miles, and while the view/area is amazing, you may be able to do something just as good for much less hiking/time. If you're already getting a rental car, consider getting two and parking one at Obstruction Point Trailhead (past Hurricane Ridge) and then driving the other car to Deer park, and taking the [Deer park to Obstruction via Maiden Peak trail](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/deer-park-to-maiden-peak).

"[Hoh Rainforest road is currently closed due to washout.](https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/current-road-conditions.htm) No idea if it will re-open in time for you.  If the Hoh remains closed, the adjacent river valley called the Bogachiel is nearly as stunning and much less crowded (Bogachiel trailhead access is also conveniently right off Hiway 101).  Bogachiel trail was recently given some much needed trail maintenance in 2021 after years of neglect.

No need to drive to Marymare Falls and then backtrack to the Sol Duc area. The Sol Duc Falls are better than Marymare anyway. You can swing by Marymare the following day on your way East toward Port Angeles.

Heart Lake is a fantastic backcountry camping destination - among the finest in the world. Seriously. Overnight camping permits for this area are tightly restricted, so get your permits early. Also note that [bear cans are required at this site](https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/wilderness-food-storage.htm). *No exceptions*. You can rent a bear can from ONP at the Quinault Ranger Station and then return it in Port Angeles. 

Descending from Heart Lake to Sol Duc trailhead is a fast and easy downhill. Depending on time, it's really nice to stop for a dip at the (affordable, tastefully developed) Sol Duc Hot Springs.

Hurricane Ridge on a summer evening is absolutely spectacular.  Grab take-out food in Port Angeles and have a picnic dinner at the Ridge. (Gordy's Pizza is only two blocks out of your way.)

The High Divide Loop is an excellent overnight hike that includes a smorgasbord of ONP delights, like high mountain views, thick rain forests, wildlife, and waterfalls.

However once you get to Port Angeles as far as I know there's no shuttle service inside the park and if you're trying to get to Hurricane Ridge it's a hell of a climb on foot, though you may be able to find a local taxi or rideshare or hitch a ride.

It's also not a short or easy ride. Barring the Strait Shot route you're probably looking at like 3-4 hours of riding and transfers, and the buses don't run very often and may have long waits between transfers.

Plan your route carefully and do inform your driver about your transfer plans. They can call ahead if they're running late to hold buses for transfers.

Also since this is rural bus service make sure to pack food and water. There's not always service or stores near stops or transfer points.

I've taken this route a bunch of times to get out to the Olympic Discovery Trail via bike for bike tours and camping.

And while this is super rare I've had some, ah, overnight adventures where I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere due to missed transfers or getting the schedule wrong. Having water, food, a backpacking stove and plenty of layers made it a more bearable overnight layover.

Something else to note is that some of these transit agencies don't operate at all on Sunday and have very limited schedules on Saturday.

This also isn't something you want to do in one day. I'm not even sure if you can get all the way to Port Angeles and back to Seattle in one day, and if you did you'd probably have to turn around and get back on a bus as soon as you got there.

Total one way fares including walk on ferry should be like $15 or less. (Edit: Strait Shot is more, though!) Bring dollar bills and coins. Orca passes don't work out there and there's not usually a way to get change near stops.",t2_1v2ps,loquacious,0,1640891121.0,0,t1_hqkxiqc,hqkxiqc,True,NotAirplanek,t3_rrrpha,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/rrrpha/the_cheapest_way_to_get_from_seattle_to_the_park/,The cheapest way to get from Seattle to the park,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/rrrpha/the_cheapest_way_to_get_from_seattle_to_the_park/hqkxiqc/,3,r/OlympicNationalPark,1,3

"This was my May itinerary last year. There was a lot of driving involved at times but we didn't have a lot of days. However we made it work and had a great time so hopefully this can give you some ideas even though you have more  time for activities.

Day 1- fly into Seattle, drive straight to Port Angeles. Got dinner and drove around the town. 

Day 2- Hurricane Ridge in the morning, lake crescent/devil's punch bowl afternoon, sol duc falls evening

Day 3- hoh rainforest in the morning, ruby beach in the afternoon, drive back to Seattle in the evening

Yes it was crazy but we wanted to see the different highlights of the park and didn't have a lot of time.  But hopefully that demonstrates what can be done. 

Also note that the sunlight seemingly lasts forever, at least compared to where I live in the south, and you can fit a lot in one day.

We stayed in a really cool Airbnb on Grants Lane in port Angeles.

Oh and be sure to check the park website frequently.  Like one day before we left for the trip I found out the hoh rainforest would be inaccessible and had to make some last minute shifts.

"Hi there!

Honestly this is itinerary with some solid bones so I think you're off to an excellent start.

A few things that jump out to me are:
-Day 2 could also include a quick stop at Madison falls as you leave Port Angeles

-For western beaches, be sure to check the tide charts. At rialto beach, there is a lot more stuff to see if the tide is low. The short hike out to the Hole in the Wall arch is great.

-I liked the Lake Crescent/Sol Duc area a lot so maybe day 5 or 6 could have some more time there since it's pretty close to Forks. The Sol Duc area has some great light-moderate hikes with thick forest and water falls. 

-Neah Bay and other Reservation lands might still be closed to visitors. I'm pretty sure they remained closed all summer 2021

-For driving back, once you get past Quinalt, there isn't much to see on the southern route, however I think it might be less prone to traffic. I don't think one option necessarily stands out more than the other.

"There is no road that goes directly through ONP.  You'll have to drive around the park - either on the north side through Port Angeles, or on the south side via Olympia.

The most direct route to Kalaloch is via the southern route. This avoids ferry delays, and will get you to Kalaloch faster. If you go this way, the best day hiking en route will be in the Lake Quinault area.

Taking the northern route via Port Angeles is definitely more scenic, with more park highlights including: Hurricane Ridge, Sol Duc, Hoh Rain Forest, Lake Crescent, etc.

Because of your flight arrival time, you'll probably have to double-back along the norther route on an additional day anway.  I would recommend doing a clockwise loop around the park.

"Hey man, 

Just got back and we had a lovely time exploring the park. The first day our original plan was to hit Marymere Falls, the Lake Crescent area, and the Sol Duc area, but the Sol Duc area was flooded so instead we hiked Mt. Storm King instead which was a lot of fun. Had the whole hike to ourselves and got really lucky with such a clear day. 

Second day we did Hurricane Ridge, and wow was it breathtaking. Definitely recommend if the weather is good. We actually have our own snow shoes and micro spikes so we brought those, but there was not enough snow to snowshoe so we brought our micros and hiked about 3 miles one way on the Klahhane Ridge Trail. Was incredible. Had the whole area to ourselves. Trail was in pretty good shape, although there were two spots were I had to clear snow from the trail in order to cross. Sunrise Point had nice views as well. Did not bother with Hurricane Hill since we did not feel like hiking on a road. Oh, also did the Elwha River area and Madison Falls on the way back to the lodge. 

Final day we did most of the main beaches and Quinault. If Hoh is still closed, honestly do not worry, Quinault was breathtaking. Felt like a different planet. Beaches were cool, but to be honest they were my least favorite part of the park and I am a huge ocean lover. Rialto was nice, but my favorite were Second Beach and Ruby Beach. Big Cedar Tree was a neat sight to see and really easy to get to although the road was a bit rough but my AWD sedan managed just fine.

We got so lucky with weather it was incredibly. Only rain we got while we weren't driving was in the rain forest, and that just made the experience that much better. 

Have fun!

"That first day might be a lot considering you are driving from Seattle and not taking a ferry. Just keep that in mind. Even though you’re an experienced hiker, I would want to take things slow so you can really enjoy everything you see. You’ll see some great stuff :)

Your locations listed sound great! I’ve been to all those places in winter except never stopped at Salmon Cascades. I’d recommend to try to avoid driving in the dark since that’s just a bit easier and safer. I would say Astoria is a cool place and worth a visit but you probably won’t have time for that squeezed into your last day. And I have to say I love the Lake Quinault Lodge and the Quinault area - lots of neat trails and amazing rainforest. 

Oh, you could stop at Beaver Falls since it’s right next to the road it won’t add any driving. It’s just off the 101 one mile or less between Sol Duc and Forks.

"I wn_7.  I also love the Olympics and have been solo and group backpacking there for about 8 seasons, each year 2-5 trips of 2-4 nights each. I live in Seattle and would go more if on the Peninsula already.  Happy to share some routes, but wondering what daily distance you are interested in? Also, are you comfortable with dispersed camping? ONP is one of the few national parks that allows this, you still need a permit, but aren’t obligated to camp at established sites. Its a great way to explore a little more. Again, happy to share some route ideas if you post your estimated daily distance (5 miles? 10? 15?) do you like to hike to a single place and camp there for a few night and do day hikes (Moose and Royal are great destinations for this) or do you like to go and camp and pack up and go and camp and pack up and go and camp?

That time of year, you would only expect to see snow in the high elevations like Hurricane Ridge, thus most of the park should be snow free. Near the Rainforest Hostel will be lots of good hiking on the beach (Ruby Beach, Kalaloch) and at the Hoh Rainforest (Hall of Mosses, Hoh River Trail). Mora Beach isn't too different from Ruby beach but does have the really cool Hole in the Wall Arch. Be sure to check tide charts and times if you're going to be doing lots of beach hiking.

For more traditional forest hiking, you will need to drive about an hour to Lake Crescent where there are great hikes easy-moderate (Ancient Groves, Sol Duc Falls, Marymere Falls) and amazing walks along the Lake. Mt Stormking is a very popular but difficult hike. 

From Rainforest Hostel to the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center is going to be at least a two hour drive. This is the best for mountain views and where you will find snowy trails.

Getting to your campsite should not be too difficult as the Hoh river mostly runs close to the 101, which is generally not too congested. Traffic tends to occur more often when getting off the highway (driving to Hoh rainforest) or if there is construction.",t2_4iuwl,no_common_sense,0,1638296066.0,0,t1_hmow0gs,hmow0gs,True,Scoutsties,t3_r5n7lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/r5n7lx/suggestions_for_spring_trip_any_advice_is_greatly/,Suggestions for spring trip?

"It's a good sampler of the park's diversity. My thoughts:

* The most important things to bring are your wet weather gear and your flexibility. November has been really wet, and there is another heavy storm moving in this weekend, with flood watches all around. That can leave whole areas inaccessible.  You mentioned backup plans already, so that's good. 
* Walk up to Marymere Falls for sure, since that's a walk right from the lodge, but maybe skip the Sol Duc road sites. I don't find Sol Duc Falls all that impressive, especially if you will be visiting Quinault, which I do recommend. 
* Across from the Quinault Lodge and Ranger Station, there are [bunch of loops possible](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/olympic/recarea/?recid=47769), and can include Cascade Falls and Gattan Creek Falls, plus some really nice rain forests. Further up the S Shore Rd, Merriman and Bunch Falls are basically roadside, though the nearby Fletcher Canyon trail is in pretty bad shape according the [wta reports](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/fletcher-canyon) (the wta trip reports are a great source for up-to-date trail information). 
* My favorite coast activities are gazing at the tide pools and, when the skies allow, watching the amazing sunsets. Unfortunately, the tide charts aren't in your favor for tide-pooling those days, especially with a mid-day visit. 
* I'm not sure I'd do all 4 beaches; they are all nice, but not that distinct from each other.  The Mora Road to Rialto sometimes floods, so that one might be inaccessible. Walking along the beaches far might be tough or impossible, because high tide is mid-day on the 3rd and 4th, and they are quite high.  Be careful on the drift logs; some are not stable, and some are slippery.

"Local PNW resident here! I just got back from a backpacking trip in ONP today.

Early December can be a very challenging time on the Olympic Peninsula in general. By this time of year the alpine areas are completely closed due to snow, and the lower elevations get constant sustained rain and 30-40F degree temperatures.

As you mentioned, we also had historic regional flooding the past week which caused road closures on Hwy 101 and destroyed a lot of trails.

If you're set on visiting in the next 2-3 weeks, I'd plan for low elevation sights like Quinault, Hoh, Lake Crescent, Lake Cushman and the beaches assuming they'll be open again by then. I'd also plan on trying to find non-NP things to do, like visiting Port Townsend, driving along the Hood Canal, etc.

In terms of weather, I'd bring the best rain gear you have (tops and bottoms) and thick fleece. Expect a lot of wet and a lot of cold. If you're staying in a campervan, bring a lot of warm blankets. And exercise good judgement on when dirt roads might be too dangerous to drive.

"101 is flooded and impassible in many places. The Calowah and Bogachiel (both near the Hoh) are both flooded, in fact people had to be airlifted out of their homes to safety near Forks. I would not recommend going to the Hoh tomorrow. If the waters recede enough to get there it'll be a muddy mess.

Here are some links to look at: 

[https://wsdot.com/travel/real-time/map/](https://wsdot.com/travel/real-time/map/) (notice all the blockages on 101 if you take the top route)

[https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/current-road-conditions.htm](https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/current-road-conditions.htm) \- Notice Upper Hoh Road is  closed, so no access to the Hoh Rainforest, however it appears the roads leading to the East Fork Quinault are open. Its another beautiful rainforest, and an exceptionally beautiful drive and several short rainforest loops.  I don't know how up to date this page is though as the wind storm may have blown down some trees. 

I'd also recommend somewhere on the East side. The Duckabush is one of my favorites and it's only about 6 miles off 101. It's not quite as lush and mossy as the westside forests, but it's still extremely lush and beautiful. Tons of fascinating fungi if that's your thing. It's more of a hike than a place to just hang out near the car. There is a short trail to Murhut  falls near there as well. Alternately, I'm honestly not sure the state of it as the whole area washed out in the last big flood we had, but the Staircase/Lake Cushman area in the North Fork of the Skokomish is really beautiful as well.

"Hi there! I hope you have a great trip to ONP, it is an awesome place and I enjoyed my time there so much.

This time of year, not all campsites are open as it is the off season. So realize that your options are can be limited, and even of those that are open, they might not have the same resources that they have open during the summer season. This gives you an overview of what's open this time of year (https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/campgroundstatus.htm) and with more detailed descriptions here (https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/camping.htm). 

To say which ones are good, I think you have to look at two things - the diversity of ONP and its size. Keep in mind, its a very large park that can take several hours just to drive across. 

-If you want to west coast beaches, I think the best options are Kalaloch or Mora. Kalaloch is really cool because its right on the beach, while Mora is a few minutes drive to the beach. However, I thought Rialto beach was a cooler beach to explore.

-If you want the rainforests, the two options are Hoh and Queets. I've only been to Hoh and it was awesome. Queets is supposed to be great too but has no running water.

-For the Crescent lake area, only Sol Duc campgrounds is open right now I think. Its beautiful there, with combination of the alpine and rainforest feel. The hot spring resorts nearby is also there, which you can buy a day pass for if that's your type of thing. Near Crescent Lake is some of the more famous trails like Mount Storm King and Sol Duc Falls. 

-Near Port Angeles and Hurricane Ridge is Heart o'hills campground. That's going to be an Alpine forest type of area which might be getting pretty cold and/or snowy in the next few weeks so keep that in mind. Lots of mountain trails there.

-There's also the staircase region that's popular, but I'm not familiar with that area.

I'm not familiar with which adventure pass you are talking about. However, the only passes that are valid are the ONP 7-day pass ($30/vehicle) or the America the Beautiful Interagency Annual Pass. Those are for entry into the park. Once at a campsite, you will have to pay the campsite fees on-site. 

All the campgrounds are accessible by regular roads, so you can get directions via Google Maps, Waze, etc.

"Check the status of Hurricane Ridge road and the webcams at the (likely closed) visitor’s center before making the trip out there. Two weeks ago, it was only sunny and clear mid-late morning and fogged in and snowed the rest of the day. It’s very cold, windy, and snowy so come prepared for the worst.

For the rest, wear warm wool/synthetic socks and waterproof hiking boots. Layer up and avoid cotton. It’s beautiful, even in the rain. The road to Hoh is kind of long. Google Maps fooled me and I lost a lot of time in my itinerary to that.

The drive to Hurricane Ridge passes through Port Angeles. Stop in at the park visitor’s center there. Do all that in the morning and you can have a meal in town and hike Marymere Falls at Crescent Lake on the way back. The hike to Sol Duc Falls is also gorgeous.

"Do you have a plan on where you're going in the park?

Some places have started getting a little snow it looks like. We've had a very wet fall so far so it could be rainy. Layers and rain gear would be good.

Are you going to be backcountry camping? If so you will need a reservation on [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov). I think you need one for a campground as well, but I'm not sure. You don't need a reservation for backcountry camping in the surrounding national forests.

The west side of the park is the wettest. The NE part is in the rainshadow, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will be dry, just drier.

Unless you're going deep into the forest roads, most places can be accessed with a sedan if you take it slow and careful but there are some potholes, so higher clearance can't hurt but isn't necessary.",t2_15ru2w3u,pilgrimspeaches,0,1633998484.0,0,t1_hgam1x5,hgam1x5,True,[deleted],t3_q5khz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/q5khz8/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/q5khz8/deleted_by_user/hgam1x5/,1,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,1

I was there in May and nothing required advance reservations except certain campsites. At this time most of them are operating as first come first serve. From what I could tell of checking the NPS website I didn’t see any changes stating timed entry or anything like that. 

If you aren’t to used to cold weather, yes I would recommend layers. I would say your base clothing, a light to medium warm layer (maybe even two if you are sensitive to the cold), and then water proof outer. Be sure to save room in your pack to shed layers as you warm up from hiking. 

I would be strategic about when you go to the Hoh rainforest, as the construction will add lots of time. When you get there talk to a ranger about best things to see in the current weather of that day (for instance hurricane ridge can easily get obscured the the clouds). 

The vast majority of places can be reached with a two-wheel drive just fine.

"1. Rain gear
2. Dress in layers
3. Waterproof hiking shoes
4. Rain gear - you want to stay warm and dry. wet clothes/shoes in 40-50 degree weather will get uncomfortable rather quickly, especially if you're acclimated to a warmer climate.  The park gets well over 100 inches of rain a year, the west side is a rain forest., but it is truly beautiful and a must see. 

Places to see:

1. Hoh Rain Forest (Rain Gear!) and it's many trails
2. The coast - from your lodge you can hike along the beach to the north and see the Tree of Life - assuming climbing tourists haven't made it collapse by then.
   1. Ruby Beach
   2. Cape Flattery
3. Hurricane Ridge

I'd recommend staying in Port Angeles or Sequim if you want to be near a town. There are a number of great looking cottages near the Dungeness Spit area by Sequim.

"Seabrook is mainly close (45min) to Quinault rain forest.  I think most people stay in Forks when visiting the west side of the park. Forks is ~45min to Hoh rainforest and ~30min to most of the beaches. 

Port Angeles is closer to most places on the north side.  It is 45min to hurricane ridge and lake crescent.

We stayed in an Airbnb in Sequim, which is about 15 min further from Port Angeles. But Port Angeles is a bigger summer town with more restaurants, shops, things to do in town. 

I recommend staying as close to the places you want to visit as possible. It doesn’t seem like much when planning, but a 2-3hr drive really takes a lot out of you before reaching your destination and if you need to return back that same day, you can spend half your day driving.

If you only have a day or two, I recommend picking one area of the park to visit and stay close to it.

"The official answer is:  “Weddings and ceremonies - Special use permits are required for events such as weddings, ceremonies, meetings or gatherings.”    Here:   https://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/permitsandreservations.htm
Though you said small group, if you want one fewer worry, might look into the permit.  

Beach Access can sometimes be a little challenging. Depending on how storms have rearranged the drift logs, there might be some to climb over, which might be tough for some, especially if formal clothing or footwear would be involved.

There’s a surprising number of websites found searching for ‘wedding in olympic national park’. Most look like professional wedding planners and photographers, but might get some good ideas from browsing some.

It will be BEAUTIFUL regardless of the weather so your photos will be magical… just make sure to plan for the rain and cold or you will be a wet, miserable mess.

"It's a 2 hour drive from Port Angeles to the Hoh.  

If you are going to be at Sol Duc, I would stay in Forks on Thursday night - might even have time to go check out the beaches near La Push - or stay in Kalaloch in one of the cabins - it's right on the water and a decent spot.  

Either place, you are an hour from the Hoh.  

That would gain an hour for your Hoh visit.  

Unless you come up to the NOP all the time, I would fit in as much as you can.  

7am departure from Seattle puts you on Hurricane Ridge by 10am-11am and you will have plenty of time to check out a hike to PJ Lake or just get the views from the parking lot and ranger station. (bring some drinking water if you plan on hiking - they are all longer on the way back when you are hiking the hills)  

Lake Crescent is just a few pull outs but make sure you stop at Storm King Ranger Station and hike to Marymere Falls - or to Mount Storm King if you're in shape...  

Sol Duc Falls hike is under 2 miles round trip - it's not bad at all.  Lovers Loop is six miles round trip - not bad either.  

You should be able to fit all that in - I just wouldn't backtrack from Sol Duc to Port Angeles if you're going back to Hoh the next day - you can stay an hour closer.  

I know Klaloch is an hour past Forks - but it's kind of worth it for an overnight - it's all easy driving too - minimal traffic on highway 101 vs. Seattle or Portland if that's what you're used to.",t2_6y9oe,TapThemOut,0,1630462132.0,0,t1_hb4y5j6,hb4y5j6,True,jamalofearth,t3_pfjw08,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/pfjw08/3_day_trip_which_one_to_cut/,3 day trip - which one to cut?,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/pfjw08/3_day_trip_which_one_to_cut/hb4y5j6/,2,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,2

"We just returned - we didn't do everything on your itinerary, so I'll stick to responding to what I know:

Dining suggestion: Salty Girls in Sequim. Don't miss it if you like oysters! We did find that dining was difficult, especially around the rainforest section. Reservations needed to be made the day before because places filled up quickly - not sure if this is normal, or a COVID development, but I'd advise thinking about dinner well before dinnertime day of. 

Sol Duc: we did the Sol Duc falls and as relatively experienced hikers (I'm working on my Catskill 3500 high peaks, but am by no means super athletic or overly serious about it) honesty were underwhelmed. It might be blasphemy to say, but I've seen prettier waterfalls right off the road in upstate NY. We did it as a recovery day hike figuring it would be easy, and I sort of wish we'd skipped it. The drive down to Sol Duc however was gorgeous. Ancient Groves (on the same road) was breathtaking and magical, and another very easy rest or recovery hike. 

Hurricane Ridge: YES. We did Sunrise Ridge Trail to Mt. Angeles and wow it was killer (I have a bum knee too, I braced up and was okay) with a sick rock scramble at the end and SO worth it. Super effing cool. We also did Elk Mountain Trail loop (which IS down a dirt road to Obstruction Point that feels scary but is okay if you take it slow) which was easier than Sunrise Ridge but arguably just as cool. Incredible totally varied environments, insane views, gorgeous flora. They're not kidding about weather changes - there's a sign warning about hypothermia even in the summer. A storm rolled in as we were in our last half of the hike and it went from HOT to very cold and very wet quickly. I've never been more thankful to be someone who tries to pack essentials even on day hikes. Those two hikes were easily highlights of my trip. 

Beaches: Kalaloch tree of life was very cool but definitely a spot for tourists to congregate. The tidal pools at low tide at fourth beach..I can't say enough good things. I've done some tidal pooling in various places and I was very happy here - tons to see! We also hiked the Ozette Triangle which wasn't easy but very much worth it. I'd recommend taking the north trail out to the beach, hike down the beach, and then hike back up and out the south trail. Elevation gains are easier that way. On the beach we were sitting within 20' of a bald eagle who carried in and started dismembering a fish on the stones. Epic. (Also had a baldie fly right over us at the start of the trail). The Big Cedar Tree near Kalaloch was amazing - it has partially fallen but still.. the sheer girth of even the still standing section is mind blowing. 

This link was great for Quinalt. [**https://www.quinaultrainforest.com/pdf/hikingmap.pdf**](https://www.quinaultrainforest.com/pdf/hikingmap.pdf)**.** We did see the Giant Sitka Spruce which was very cool - but touristy. Worth the quick stretch of the legs though! I anticipated spending more time hiking than we actually did in Quinalt. It was great to drive the whole loop though - assuming you're good with a dirt road. Once we got off the pavement we saw hardly anyone and found several great little tucked away spots to just sit and exist in nature.

Rainier/Tahoma....words cannot begin to describe. We originally had just planned on doing ONP but when we flew into Seattle, Rainier was just..towering. We HAD to do it. So we cut some superfluous stuff out of our itinerary and shifted to change our 2nd to last night in Rainier. We hiked one short Silver Forest hike at Sunrise in the evening pre-check in, and we were going to do something else there but in the evening after doing some last minute research realized the move was to get down to Paradise and hike the Skyline loop. Getting to the trailhead at 730a and having a ranger confirm that yes we made the right choice, and that yes we'd be fine in terms of crowds because we arrived early had us feeling good. The hike..AMAZING. Literally start to finish a jaw dropper. It wasn't easy but again with a bum knee I was fine, just took it semi-slow, didn't feel the need to power hike, and took plenty of snack/water/gaze/photo op breaks. Highly, highly, highly recommend. We also caught a glimpse of elk early in the morning here while driving to Rainier.

Enjoy!! I know we saw so little of both parks. I'd go back to Olympic if it was right, and Rainier I'd 1000% revisit!",t2_7dloyzrb,Alamac1220,0,1630425638.0,0,t1_hb2l3ue,hb2l3ue,True,AsukaHiji,t3_pexms6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/pexms6/itinerary_advice_sept_1525/,Itinerary advice- Sept 15-25,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/pexms6/itinerary_advice_sept_1525/hb2l3ue/,5,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,5

"Agree about the drive times. Map out the drive from SeaTac to Port Angeles. Your three day agenda will involve a lot of driving. Consider the Hood Canal Bridge which frequently opens to marine traffic and the back ups can delay you more than an hour. Same with Ferries if you are going that route. All the sites in the OP right now are experiencing high volumes of visitors for our area and have been since summer 2020. Local residents are more vaccinated and mask friendly. The majority of the visitors are from other places NOT so great at this. For this reason I have spent a second summer NOT visiting the park and it’s in my backyard. We tried to visit Sol Duc and Kalaloch last summer. It looked like 6 Flags. Every single license plate was out of state. Hoh has an hour wait to get into the park during peak times right now. It’s not all doom and gloom though. It’s a big beautiful park. There are places to find peace of you are willing to hike to them. Any place a rv can get to or has really easy access is crowded. Also there is a complete burn ban on right now except gas fire pits? Best to check with the state park website for up to date info on wait times, closures, and incidents.

Cirque rim for sunrise or sunset

[https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/cirque-rim-nature-trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/washington/cirque-rim-nature-trail)

Do hurricane hill hike spend some time up there taking in the view and looking at the mountain horizons. I would recommend not rushing to the next place. 

Then I would go to Mt Storm King. the hike would take about two hours but has some pretty intense parts where you have to use ropes to get to the top. but instead you could do marymere falls. I recommend hanging around the beach that faces the east and then exploring all of the moments in time trail. its so underrated and there is beautiful moss trees, almost equally as good as hoh rainforest hall of mosses - which is a really cool hike. the moments in time trail will take you to some cool beach spots and there are the mountains that surround you. you can hang near the lodge for an awesome sunset spot

Rialto beach is okay in my opinion and can be foggy often. i think it clears up more in the late afternoon or evening. Im not all too much of a beach person tho.

"Hello, 

On Sunday 8/8 a small red dirty sack fell off my pack while detouring around a down tree on the flapjack lakes trail. Didn’t realize till at the top, and asked the next group up after us if they saw a red bag. Turns out they did! And left it hanging in a tree on the trail. Unfortunately by the time I got back down there, someone else had grabbed it. Sucks. 

So, very long shot, did anyone find a small red ditty bag on the flapjack lakes trail? It had my tents (marmot limelight 2p) rain fly in it and since it’s an older model I don’t think I can’t get a replacement. Lots of sentimental value there, y’all know how that goes. 

Any news would be great, or any other resources to try. I already checked with the ranger station, no luck.

We had pretty sunny days, though, no rain, so that definitely played a part in what I was comfortable in.

"I just got back today from a Seattle & ONP trip! We stayed at an Airbnb in port angeles and it was the perfect place to stay. We were a 30 min drive from Lake Crescent which was absolutely beautiful. It’s a stay that’s also fairly close to Hurricane Ridge. We also visited the rainforest and the beach, both of which were about a 2-3 hour drive away which varied with traffic. 

IMO, the Hoh Rainforest trip is only worth it for the Hoh River. We hiked the trail until river access and it was absolutely beautiful, the glacial water makes it icy blue. Aside from that, we found it to be underwhelming, but I’d like to visit it during the rainy season. If you want to skip the wait (we waited 1.5 hours to get in) I’d recommend Marymere Falls trail. It’s very short but it was beautiful and less packed, and very close to Lake Crescent so a much shorter drive. We also did some fishing there and caught some trout if you’re interested in fishing at all! Overall though I’d say stay in Port Angeles for sure. The view from there is great too!!",t2_2bm4p1za,avianpower,0,1628224424.0,0,t1_h7wd8ls,h7wd8ls,True,heyJabroni1,t3_oyw7ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/oyw7ev/lodging_when_visiting_olympic_and_seattle/,Lodging when visiting Olympic and Seattle,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/oyw7ev/lodging_when_visiting_olympic_and_seattle/h7wd8ls/,2,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,2

"You'll definitely want to find lodging on the peninsula for your time in the park- the drive times don't take into account ferry wait lines, Hood canal bridge closures, etc. The ferry waits can be brutal during peak season- sometimes hours of waiting. To get to the Hoh visitor center from Seattle, you're looking at more like a 4 hour drive each way, if you skip the ferries and drive the long way around. Even staying in Port Angeles, it's 2 hours to the Hoh visitor center. 

I don't know which parts of the park you want to visit- it's huge and there are a lot of different things to see, but maybe you would want to stayi in PA one night to hike around Hurricane Ridge and see lake crescent, then two nights in Forks-ish area to explore the beaches and rainforest.",t2_7jlj0b81,BelligerentCoroner,0,1628220097.0,0,t1_h7w5fii,h7w5fii,True,heyJabroni1,t3_oyw7ev,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/oyw7ev/lodging_when_visiting_olympic_and_seattle/,Lodging when visiting Olympic and Seattle,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/oyw7ev/lodging_when_visiting_olympic_and_seattle/h7w5fii/,2,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,2

"I can help! My wife were in a similar situation where we were trying to found showers. I couldn't find a ton of resources but was able to get by.

At Lake Quinault, the Rain Forest Resort Village had coin showers that were very affordable. The shower was passable but I couldn't really complain at their price. I think I only used a few bucks of coins. No towels or soaps provided.

In Forks, the Forks Motel has one shower room. Its 10 dollars per person to use but it was very clean, good shower, and they offered a set of motel towels, soap, and shampoo. you paid at the front desk so they accepted credit card.

Most of the campgrounds at Washington State parks also offer showers. Fort Worden in Port Townsend had very clean and nice coin showers. Good pressure and hot water. I think it was something like 3 minutes per 50 cents. So I would hope/assume the other state parks are as well maintained.

"Not sure what your timeframe is, but Johnston Ridge Observatory on St. Helens is only 45 min from the freeway, so if you have a couple extra hours, that might be a cool side trip.

If you are heading up the east side of the peninsula to get to Port Angeles, you should drive up Mt. Walker. There's a viewpoint on the top with a great view. It's right off 101.

Definitely make time for Hurricane Ridge. It's awesome up there.

If I were you, which I'm obviously not, I'd spend all of day 3 in the rainforest and all of day 4 exploring the beaches.

Alternately, take a day near Staircase in the SE corner of the park before the day on the north side. If you're in shape for a short, intense hike, Mt. Ellinor has just about the best views ever.

"If you do sol duc falls, there are a few hikes that would be very easy to do on the same day. If you look on a map, the salmon cascades, ancient groves, lover's lane, and sol duc falls are all on the same dead-end road. 

The salmon cascades is incredibly short and is probably only interesting during the salmon run. It does have a nice view of the river and only takes about ten minutes to see. You'll hit that first on road.

After salmon cascades, you'll come across the ancient groves. This is worth your time in my opinion. It's an easy hike with no incline and just about a mile loop. It is quite beautiful though. 

If you keep going down the road, you'll run in lover's lane next. It's a cool trail that makes a loop and it INCLUDES sol duc falls in it. If you really only want to see sol duc falls though, you can just drive until the road dead ends, skip the lover's lane trail, and head right to sol duc falls. You'll get there much quicker that way. 

Storm king, marymere falls, and moments in time will probably take your entire morning, if not longer. You'll also more than likely want to eat lunch and have a break after all that.

"I have done all of the following in one day and had time left over: hall of mosses, spruce nature trail, a few miles of the hoh river trail and the entire Rialto beach trail. I would definitely get to the hoh rain forest very early because the line gets so long! You will waste hours sitting in line if you don't get there early. You could pair (most of) your day 1 & day 3 together in my opinion. I would also try to arrive at the hall in the wall at Rialto beach at low tide (which varies daily) so that you can actually walk in the tide pools and through the hole.

If you are going to hike storm king, you should do marymere falls on the same day because they share the same trailhead and it's only a minor detour. I have done both on the same hike and it was not bad at all. If you do go to the very top of storm king you will have to use the ropes and walk over a very narrow and jagged rock sections at the very top. Just an FYI in case that does not appeal to you. Also, the moments in time trail is quite close to both storm king and marymere falls in case you are looking for another very short hike.

Devil's punchbowl is a pretty short hike, if you are only walking to bridge and back. This shouldn't take you long at all. If you only do the hurricane hill part of the trail, it doesn't take that long either. The driving to hurricane hill could feel longer than the hike with all the winding roads! 

Since sequim is a decent drive from your day 1 and day 3 destinations, I'd definitely try to pair as much of day 1 & day 3 together on one day and then spend more time in the sequim area. There is so much more to see: sol duc falls, ancient groves, elwha river, lover's lane.

"This is definitely a very doable day and would be great for the different locales. I think the order is good.

The drive from Port A to the Hurricane Ridge visitor center is abouve 45 minutes so that's about 1.5 hrs round trip. I'd recommend driving to the hurricane hill trailhead and at least walking down the trail a little bit to take a look. So between that and looking around the visitor center area, you'll probably spend 2-3 hours in the hurricane ridge area.

The round trip drive time from Port Angeles to Sol duc falls trail head is about 2-2.5 hours. Marymere falls is along the way. You'll definitely want to stop along the way for the views of the lake. Both falls trails take about an hour to 1.5 hour depending on your pace and how much to take photos and such. The Ancient grove on the way to Sol duc is also a good quick nature loop.

"I don't see why not. We did something similar a couple weeks ago. We started from Forks so had a bit longer initial drive. We started our day just before 7AM. Our route was:

1. Sol Duc Falls Trail - 1.6mi. Very nice walk, we were one of the two cars in the parking lot, and saw 2 other people at the falls. It probably would not feel as special if it was crowded so I was happy we did this early.
2. Then we drove to Marymere Falls + Mount Storm King trailhead. We did both hikes - 5.3mi Mt Storm King, awesome hike but definitely hard. There are 6 rope sections at the end that you have to use if you want to get to the summit. Great views. We did Marymere Falls section on the way back before heading back to the car. The beginning of Mt Storm King trail was pretty empty but on the way back it definitely got a bit more crowded. Marymere Falls was pretty busy but it wasn't too bad. It's a short trail.
3. We ate our packed lunch and started heading to the Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center. This took some time, we waited about 45min at the entrance, but it's understandable since it was midday on Saturday. I think we got there around 2.30PM. We did Hurricane Hill via Hurricane Ridge (parking lot for this is about a mile passed visitor center) which is about 3mi walk. It's moderate difficulty, all paved and all uphill. Nice views, definitely recommend. On the way back we stopped at the visitor center which was almost closing up. I think they are open until 5PM in summer.

It was a busy day but definitely doable. If you don't do Mt Storm King, then it becomes even more manageable. Either way you will end up doing something in the middle of the day so it will probably be somewhat crowded.

Correction: The distance from Lake Quinault Lodge/Ranger Station is about 17 miles. You might be able to hitch it.

Do you have back-country permits? Reservations are required this year, I believe. You can't just show up and get one. A bear canister is also required.

Edit, you still need to reserve your Wilderness Camping Permit at [Recreation.gov](https://Recreation.gov), but most quotas have been lifted: ""As of July 12th, 2021, quotas that were implemented in the Olympic Wilderness due to the COVID 19 pandemic have been lifted. Availability will no longer be limited in many wilderness camping areas. Areas that historically operated on a quota basis, such as Sol Duc / Seven Lakes Basin, Grand Valley, Royal Lake, the Cape Alava / Sand Point area, and others, will be unaffected by this change. No additional availability will open for these areas. Consult the Olympic Wilderness Trip Planner Map to determine which areas operate on a quota basis. Quota sites are color coded red/yellow.""

"I'd suggest either [Staircase](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/staircase) in the Park itself, which is the beginning of the North Fork of the Skokomish, a beautiful riverwalk with great trees. It's 2.3 miles but you can tack on as much extra as you want as the trail past the loop crosses the whole park. 

A couple more options slightly farther south are on the South Fork of the Skokomish: [Spider Lake](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/spider-lake), a lovely little lake in the SE corner of the forest which doesn't get many visitors. It requires a bit of a drive on the forest roads to get to, but it's a great little lake to meander around. Both the Upper and [Lower South Fork Skokomish](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lower-south-fork-skokomish-river) are also great. The lower's probably better with a family as it doesn't require you to ford the river or cross on any logs. The bonus for the South Fork area trails is they're in the National Forest and not the National Park, so you don't have to pay as much. 

These have forest views, not mountain views. The best  mountain views on the SE part of the park is Mt. Ellinor. It's only 3.3 miles round trip but that's steeeeep.

"Another option could be the Lower Lena Lake Trail, which is 7 miles RT - it's in ONF, not ONP, but you can continue to Upper Lena Lake, which is in the Park (adds another 7 miles to the RT). You'll need the  Northwest Forest Pass, or America the Beautiful Pass to park.

These are for through hikes, where you drop your car off at your exit point and schedule a shuttle to take you to your entrance point. You'll still need a car.

If you just want to hike into the Enchanted Valley and hike back out to the same point, then just rent a car at Sea-Tac.

Technically, you could take a bus or train to Olympia, and take Grays Harbor Transit's #40 to Aberdeen, then #50 to Lake Quinault Lodge/US Ranger Station, which will leave you about 20 miles to the trailhead (hike or hitch). Only M-F, however. You might have to Uber to make connections.

"You said where you can and cannot go but no further descriptions; do you mean like scenery, trail conditions, elevation, or all of the above?

As far as I know dogs are only really allowed near the parking lots, and on the Spruce Railroad trail. Once you get in the park and past the parking lot they aren't really allowed on trails at all. The Railroad trail is very flat and on the north shore of lake crescent and so not connected to the rest of the park, which is why I think they are allowed there. There might be some beaches where they are welcome. 

Unofficially you can take them up the Hotsprings road on the Elwha, but only on the paved road (because the road washed out and cars can't get past the entrance gate).

"Too far for most is taking in everyone. It's the Park, they have to be cautious. I have certainly hiked farther than the distance to Glacier Meadows in a day before, but not with camping gear. If you've all backpacked that far before than go for it; there are only 5 or 6 miles of incline. You can see on [this page](https://myfavoritehikes.wordpress.com/2015/06/17/hoh-rainforest-backpack/) an elevation profile. The last 5 miles increase about 2500 feet. But if you have only day hiked that far before without camping gear I probably wouldn't try it. 

It is strange that they have the group site available though. They must have those coded slightly different since there aren't as many. This is a new site because of Covid.

"I only just saw this comment, so I’m not sure if I answered this already in DMs but here ya go!
Hoh (if you only do the small trails like spruce, hall of mosses, etc) is about a half day visit, same with Rialto. It really depends on how much time you want to spend at each spot. There’s a little cafe and gift shop on the road to and from hoh, a cafe at the three rivers resort, a few places in forks, plenty of food places in port angeles, and a little cafe at the top of hurricane ridge. For most of my meals I bought sandwich materials and then had a picnic at the top of my hikes, and in the mornings/evenings I cooked at my campsite or got a burger nearby. Highly recommend the picnic thing or even just snacking at a rest point on the hikes—there’s something therapeutic about eating an apple on top of a cliff. I took a ferry to the peninsula, so port Townsend was the start and end of my journey there. The first day I drove from there to port angeles, got coffee (Bc I had the earliest ferry possible), drove to and hiked mt storm king and the falls, then drive to forks, got gas/wood/food supplies, and visited Rialto. I didn’t hike it bc the tide was high and I wanted to be able to see the tide pools when I hiked it. Then I camped in forks. Second day was hoh (early), then Rialto and hole in the wall at low tide in the afternoon.  Drove to port angeles and camped. Last day was hurricane ridge, ate lunch there, then drove to port angeles and got a slice of pizza for a snack, drove to port Townsend and got a poke bowl and walked around before my late evening ferry, and that was the end of this trip.",t2_4visk887,leaaaaaaaah,0,1624203626.0,0,t1_h2frsef,h2frsef,False,[deleted],t3_o1opws,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/o1opws/park_safety_for_solo_traveler/,Park safety for solo traveler?,/r/OlympicNationalPark/comments/o1opws/park_safety_for_solo_traveler/h2frsef/,2,r/OlympicNationalPark,0,2

"Awesome! Well, 3 rivers resort near forks is a great little campground—even if you don’t stay there, they have showers (quarter operated) for anyone to use. Plenty of people, it’s on the main road to la push, and it’s on the “treaty line” (IYKYK). In port angeles I stayed at a campsite near the Elwah river, hosted by “David”. He’s got camper van campsites that are wide open and have a great view of the river, plus a fire pit and the safety of knowing that there are multiple other people around you as well as the host up in his home. I felt very safe there last night! It is pricey, but IMO the view is worth it since you’re literally right next to the river. Other than that, the heart o’the Hills campground is first come first served, costs $24/night, and is in the middle of the woods but is PACKED. Literally completely full every night.

"Me reading this as I’m getting ready to go to sleep in my car underneath the Olympic mountains 👁👄👁. I’m from the Midwest and not afraid of bears, but I do spook myself when I’m alone so for peace of mine I’ve been parking at campgrounds. Heart o the hills is big and only $24/night, but get there early to get a place. Otherwise there are plenty of pullouts on national forest roads to camp, or use Airbnb to find a nice place. That’s what I did and I’m currently sleeping next to a river in my car. I haven’t had experience with bears other than the Midwest black bear, but honestly if you hike on a popular trail and then camp in a smart way (everything in your car at night, don’t leave food out, keep food within an arms reach) you’ll be fine.

"Three rivers resort is great! It’s on Airbnb. It’s not a “resort” persay, but is has some cabins, RV parking, and tent areas. There is a cafe and store on-site, as well as showers (hard to come by), laundry, flush toilets, RV water/electric hookup, and an area to wash dishes. It’s located on the twilight treaty line on the road to la push. Unfortunately la push is closed, but there is also Rialto beach and third beach within a 10 min drive, forks within 15 mins, lake crescent within about an hour, and the hoh rainforest in just over an hour.

"Forks is going to be the closest place (town) to that but let me tell you as someone who just booked to go this summer it is going to be crazy and anything that’s on the reservation land is closed. 
I would highly suggest going next year (if this trip wasn’t a surprise gift my choice would have been to wait). I would’ve chosen to go next year.

We booked our hotel a few weeks ago and they barely had any room. Airbnb in that area gets swiped up quick because people realize it’s closer to see that than driving almost 2 hours from Port Angeles. It is better than nothing if you have no other choices.
