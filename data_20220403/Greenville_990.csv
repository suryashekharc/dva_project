"You missed the part where I mentioned multiple times that Henry’s was a self service restaurant where your waitress only brought food out and did not do anything after that. I’ll mention it one more time, it was a self service, non-tip restaurant. You don’t tip at McDonald’s or Chick-fil-A so don’t chastise me for not tipping at a restaurant that did not take tips. You must not be familiar with the restaurant. You also missed the part where I said my biggest gripe with the tip is how it is verbally asked for while being stared down and forced to publicly announce a number out loud for all of the restaurant without any services yet rendered.

To answer your question I do typically tip at least 20% except at restaurants that don’t have a tip model. These are typically self service restaurants. I always round up so I actually tip >20% and places like Waffle House I tip closer to 30-50% because the meals are less expensive but the wait staff are working harder than other restaurants.

"""The separation between church and state was not designed to keep the church out of the government, it was designed to keep the government out of the church."" No, pretty sure it was designed to do both of those things. The original context was the problematic Anglican Church, where one could be physically punished for having committed spiritual crimes, not attending a certain number of services, not being able to prove registry at an Anglican church, etc. It was fuckin' bonkers. The whole point of the Church/State Discrete Dichotomy is to keep government from either interfering with or RELYING ON one or more particular religions. After all, a federal entity that is allegiant to one religion, especially one who holds ""thou shalt have no other gods before me"" as a core belief, cannot be reasonably expected to protect its citizens' right to practice another religion, or no religion at all.

"Nothing too exotic.  Just typical impatient parent stuff I'm sure you'd find at any elementary school - not picking up the kid at the correct pick-up point, not waiting in line but pulling ahead in the passing lane to pick up the kid while blocking that lane, driving too fast, etc.  Sometimes it was like herding cats, and rainy days were the worst.  Some people just feel that their time is more valuable than anyone else's or the safety of anyone else's child.

Occasionally you'd get a non-custodial parent or someone without permission trying to pick up a kid then get real pissy when we wouldn't let the child go with them.  We always let the principal deal with them.

One last comment...I did this back in the 90s before they built the new school. The traffic pattern is better now, but you can't change how some parents behave.  I always preferred working with the kids than dealing with parents.",t2_e8k85,RandomConnections,0,1648900155.0,0,t1_i33jtj1,i33jtj1,False,SnazzySaul,t3_ttotrw,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/ttotrw/there_are_two_types_of_parents_in_this_world/,There are Two types of parents in this world…,/r/greenville/comments/ttotrw/there_are_two_types_of_parents_in_this_world/i33jtj1/,4,r/greenville,0,4

"United States v. Hawkins (2013): In Hawkins, the 18-year-old defendant downloaded child pornography depicting prepubescent boys, ages 8 to 12, engaging in sexual acts with other children and adults. Defendant uploaded 37 such images to a file-sharing service. Law enforcement ultimately discovered 17 videos and 16 images saved on the defendant’s computer. Judge Jackson’s sentence of 3 months was significantly lower than every other recommendation (18 months from probation, 24 months from the prosecutor, and 97 to 121 from the Sentencing Guidelines). After serving his short sentence, defendant reoffended and violated the terms of supervised release in 2019. Judge Jackson placed him in a halfway house for six months.

Key Quotes from Judge Jackson in this case:

“I feel so sorry for [your family] and for you and for the anguish that this has caused all of you.”
“This seems to be a situation in which you were fascinated by sexual images involving what were essentially your peers.”
“I do think that the guideline factors are in many ways outdated and no longer adequately distinguish more serious child pornography offenders from less serious child pornography offenders. For example, the Guidelines focus primarily on the number of images and the use of a computer, which are hardly aggravating factors today.”
“I don’t feel that it is appropriate, necessarily, to increase the penalty on the basis of your use of a computer or the number of images or prepubescent victims as the Guidelines require because these circumstances exist in many cases, if not most, and don’t signal an especially heinous or egregious child pornography offense.”
“This seems to be a situation in which you were fascinated by sexual images involving what were essentially your peers.”
“[S]ex offenders are truly shunned in our society, but I have no control over those collateral consequences.”

She apologizes to the defendant and said an 18 yo man’s peers are 8-12.  And yet with a slap on the wrist, he re-offends and gets 6 mos in a halfway house. 

United States v. Cane (2019): In Cane, the defendant amassed a collection of over 6,500 files depicting school-age children, including elementary school children who were engaged in sexual conduct and sadomasochistic acts such as with adult men and foreign objects. Judge Jackson failed to apply sentencing enhancements to address the significant number of files at issue and she did not apply the enhancement for sadistic or masochistic content, as recommended by the probation office. Judge Jackson “modified the facts” against probation’s recommendation, ordering thousands of files excluded from consideration at sentencing. She ultimately handed down the lowest allowable sentence: 60 months (the mandatory minimum).

Key Quote from Judge Jackson in this case: “[You’re] obviously aware of my policy disagreement.  I just think it’s very, very hard to deal with number of images as a significant aggravator…”",t2_d3um0e2,nsbbeachguy,0,1648867991.0,0,t1_i32d40x,i32d40x,False,Poetryisalive,t3_tte4lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/tte4lv/sen_graham_says_hell_vote_against_ketanji_brown/,Sen.

True. Homeschool is unfortunately not an option for everyone. It is also unfortunate that many others put more value in their career/ work or hobbies than they do their child and will make every excuse in the world to justify to themselves putting their child 2nd.

"Just saw a news post that an 8th grader down in Gray Court this afternoon posted threats to the school via snapchat. Student has since been arrested. This is number what so far this year of threats in our schools? And yesterday someone pulled the trigger and killed another child. And didn't we see in the news just a week or so ago another student in Spartanburg beat another child over the head with a chair? What in the heck is going on people? Did someone spike the water or what? 

I've always had the opinion that the next mass shooting can be stopped by the parents. That would actually mean parents to be active in their childs life. A kid doesn't just wake up and go shooting. Body language, eating, moods, getting into fights or arguments, searching things on the internet, writing down plans in books, use of hidden apps. Search your childs room, go through phone apps and social media. Studies have also shown that some of the worst shootings in US history there was no father present. Not saying that's the case here but it speaks loud and clear that a child needs his father. I've seen some school implement a program where local fathers step up and help out to those kids who don't have one. Maybe we need to look into that.",t2_8nsdmdsm,CrossFitAddict030,0,1648838753.0,0,t1_i30miq2,i30miq2,True,Imonanonym,t3_ttrpm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/ttrpm1/soooo_there_was_another_school_shooting_how_is/,Soooo there was another school shooting?

"Some attorneys will give you a consultation for free. I don't think any of the folks I have listed will. Keep in mind that there is an opportunity cost for meeting with these attorneys. Typically even consulting with you about divorce will mean they can't later represent your spouse. 

So you can't go wrong with any of the attorneys I listed - and plenty more who are competent.

That said - your asset concerns (joint accounts, possibility of them being emptied) is an issue you need to bring up with your attorney.

So - again, IANAL, and you (and your specific case in general) need the counsel and wisdom of a lawyer. (NO, really, you should be talking to a lawyer rather than people like us on Reddit, right now!)

With that disclaimer out of the way, there may be some strategy elements that you have to decide on regarding the efficacy of filing an at-fault divorce with your circumstances. Typically a spouse isn't going to be eligible for alimony after only 2 years of marriage. The elimination of alimony is the biggest benefit to proving adultery. It may be more efficient for you to file for an uncontested divorce. Filing (and proving) adultery can be substantially more expensive, and you want to make sure that the juice is worth the squeeze. But again, I don't know the specifics of your case or you, nor am I qualified to give you legal advice.

I'll DM you with my recommendation based on what you've said above.",t2_104ro4,nalleypi,0,1648830144.0,0,t1_i300rt7,i300rt7,False,red_throw_gvlsc,t3_tto57w,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/tto57w/divorce_lawyer_recommendations/,divorce lawyer recommendations,/r/greenville/comments/tto57w/divorce_lawyer_recommendations/i300rt7/,3,r/greenville,0,3

"Love Henry’s. It’s my kind of barbecue place. More of a hole in the wall atmosphere with good pulled pork.

Neg, the waitresses will ask you if you’d like to add a tip before taking your card for payment. As in, they ask you out loud if you would like to tip and how much in earshot of everyone else around. Absolutely abhorrent. FYI, this was always a mostly self serve restaurant other than them bringing your food out when it was ready. You got your own drinks and you bussed your own table.

Neg #2, they have in the past turned us away on a rainy day when they said the tables inside were full. We saw people getting up to leave, clearing the table. We’ve never had an issue standing to wait before. We were in process of getting our kid out of the car but we’re absolutely not going to wait in the parking lot until the waitress remembered to come let us know the free table was actually free. This was not in peak covid times. Mask and seating restrictions were lifted.

Good barbecue. I voiced my concerns to the owner and never heard back. I despise the tip situation. I don’t want to be “pan handled” for tips before service is rendered.

"Yes I think that would help a lot! I've done counseling before for depression and relationship stuff and it's been helpful, but never for something like this.

Like I don't know if I'll really be able to trust anyone again - this was just so far out of right field I never saw it coming.

After several years of living together and then almost two years of marriage, you'd think you would know a person, but somehow she's been hiding this from me, lying to me, still saying she loves me, still sharing my bed... it's so fucked up. I can't imagine ever doing what she's done to a partner. I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

Homeschool your kids. Public schools are in drastic need of reform and parents need to spend more time with their kids. Blame guns all you want they aren’t the cause no matter how loud you scream they are. There has never been a gun whispering in a kids ear “kill” too many parents just dump their kids off at an underfunded state run daycare and expect the school to raise them.

"Thank you for the recommendations! I'm not worried about her hiding assets, or at least not worried that she has assets I'm unaware of. If there is anything I don't know about it's likely from before we got married so would remain hers anyway per my understanding.

We do have joint checking/savings accounts, and I'm not sure what to do about those. It seems like she could really cause trouble by moving all our money into a personal account. I'd assume a move like that wouldn't go unnoticed and the court would eventually make sure the assets got divided properly, but who knows what she'd be spending the money on in the meantime (a lawyer of her own? blowing money just because? I don't know what to expect from her).

I could do the same (move it all to a personal account) to keep the money safe, but I don't know if that would cause trouble for me (looking like I'm trying to hide assets). Someone else in the thread mentioned an injunction to keep her from fucking up assets. I'm not sure how that works but I'll be sure to bring it up with lawyers.

We'll have been married for 2 years in May. No children yet, she's been on the pill the whole time we've been together and as far as I can tell is still keeping that up. I won't be taking any chances in that department though.

Other marital assets include various retirement accounts in each of our names, with a lot more in my name than hers. I'll definitely be looking to protect as much of mine as possible. We each have a car (with both our names on each title) and we're both on the house's deed, though I'm the only one on the mortgage since I make more and she only works part time.

Does any of that suggest a 'best' attorney for my case, or others who might be more suitable?

I've never had to 'shop around' for a lawyer before. Will they typically give you a few minutes of their time to interview them about how good a fit they would be for the case, or can I expect to pay for every second I'm on the phone with them?

"Your original point was:

""Man, every person who obviously rides a bike that’s commenting seems like such a fucking prick""

Followed by: 

""And if they would just abide by the same rules then no one would be unsafe. It’s not that hard.""

The first one just tells me you have a grudge against bikers. The second tells me that you view ONLY cyclists as being at fault, as if drivers follow the rules either. How many drivers have you seen run red lights, roll stop signs, text while driving, turn into oncoming traffic, merge in front of someone who was obviously going faster than them, almost hit a pedestrian in a crosswalk...Fuck off with this ""follow the rules and we'll be fine"" bullshit. You are the one driving a heavy machine. You have a responsibility to not run over someone, even if they are doing something dumb.

"That makes sense when you're young/middle aged, but isn't a license good for like, 10 years? There's quite a big difference between testing at say, 26 and 36, than there would be at 66 and 76. I know it's not cool to hate on old people but the reality is that your body just doesn't work the same when you get older, and it's not like it's a linear decline. We really need better testing to begin with (God knows how half the people around here even GOT a license), and then continued testing that increases as you get older. Seems like an easy problem to fix (given the willpower to fix it) by just making licenses expire sooner when you get older and requiring retests for renewals like you said.

DECA is the most perfectly located apartment downtown. Living downtown is great because even if you don't live downtown you still come downtown to do absolutely everything anyways so makes it so much easier. Being able to walk to any restaurant and since you're at DECA there is a grocery store a couple blocks away. I've lived downtown for 4 years and have only put 17k miles on my car.

"For a gun to be an effective tool with which to defend yourself and your home, it is necessary to have them accessible. We use fingerprint lockboxes to try and ensure that they could never be misused. But even police officers sometimes have incidents where something like that happens.  

Also, your comment makes some WILD ASSUMPTIONS. You have no idea where the kid got a gun. Could have been a friend or friend’s house but you are ready to crucify the parents.

I get it, this is a sad and scary event and the first reaction is to want to make it go away so you don’t have to worry about it happening to you one  day and that is an admirable goal. 

But making assumptions and blaming people who may be completely innocent isn’t a good start.

"Chattanooga actually started this back in 2008. Now they have the fastest broadband in the country, for just $70 a month. 

Here's an excerpt from a recent 99 percent invisible episode: 

>Back in the mid-2000s, Chattanooga was a bit like Detroit, with limited internet access options for most telecom customers. Then the city decided that starting in 2008, EPB, the local public power utility, should enter the telecom market and become an internet provider, meaning EPB would compete with the existing providers to sell internet connections to businesses and households.

>EPB already had power lines that reached every home and business in town, meaning they could put these super-fast internet lines right alongside them. And so EPB started laying down fiber all over the city. This sparked a war with the existing private providers to provide faster and faster speeds. At first, these speeds almost excessive, but of course over time they paid off.
>The idea was that even if EPB didn’t dominate the market, they would foster competition and force the private companies to provide better services. And that is, in fact, what happened. It’s also easy for new customers to adopt EPB’s services, since all the cables are already in place. EPD also provides at-cost service to low-income families, creating greater access equality.
>Economists predicted that city-wide fiber would stimulate the addition of 2,000 jobs over ten years. According to some studies, it’s actually added about 10,000 jobs. Not long into the pandemic, the surrounding county’s unemployment rate was 2% lower than the national average. Treating broadband as a public good did great things for the public.

"In each of the cases you are referring to, the prosecutor and defendant had entered into plea deals. To ensure the plea deal wasn't garbage, Jackson asked for the sentencing guidelines and norms for similar cases nationwide from the United States Sentencing Commission for the prior 5 years. Her final rulings were well within those guidelines and norms.

This is what good judgeship looks like. She double checked the plea deal to make sure it was appropriate, and verified with the national committee who has the data to back up their recommendation.

The thing you have to remember is once something goes to a jury, all bets are off. You say those who harm children should have the book thrown at them, I agree. But it only takes one clown on the jury to refuse to convict, and these predators would be back on the streets. From an ethical perspective, do you guarantee these guys get locked away for a decade, or do you gamble with the chance they get off scott free?

Just to be clear, Jackson did not enter these plea deals. If you are a gambler with child predators and wish they would have been locked up longer, take that up with the prosecutors.",t2_1vgi,CaptainObvious,0,1648778070.0,0,t1_i2xhode,i2xhode,False,Poetryisalive,t3_tte4lv,https://www.reddit.com/r/greenville/comments/tte4lv/sen_graham_says_hell_vote_against_ketanji_brown/,Sen.

"Well, when I was moving up here, I was quoted the same price by two different reps, then in January, I got approved for that subsidy, and suddenly, my base price went up by $15/month.  When I talked to customer service about it they said, ""Well, what you had before was a PROMOTIONAL price..."" something which neither of the reps I spoke to had mentioned.  But, my total bill was lower, so I was just going to go with it, and in Jan and Feb, I was billed the lower price, but this month, I was billed the FULL price, so I contacted customer service this afternoon, and they said, ""Oh, well, you got a credit for the subsidy.""  There is no credit on my credit card statement.  ""Oh, well, it's going to start showing up around the 30th of every month...""  So, now I've got a bill that's $15 higher than what I was quoted plus a credit for a subsidy that's taking longer and longer to see.  If it doesn't show up on my CC statement in the next few day, I'll have to talk to them again.  The service itself has been fine, but it's this crap that I hate.

"I don't think you realize how hypocritical you come across here. You're making the exact same arguments the bikers you hate so much are making, and the fact that you are just ranting about west coast transplants and REI makes it worse. You think the land belongs to you and your dirt bike/ATV/gun/whatever, and anyone else who wants to enjoy the land is wrong because you had it first. That's not how it works. There are other considerations to why motorized vehicles are being choked out of off-road areas, and it has way more to do with the effect they have on the environment, trails, etc. than it does with bikers complaining about them - but that's not really the argument here. Besides, there are always people complaining about the bikers, too - we can't ride on the road, so we take up mountain biking, but wait! Now the hikers are pissed off that there are bikes ripping up and down a mountain disturbing their hike! Or the horse riders are pissed that bikes in Dupont are spooking their horses! Or we get an e-bike to make climbs easier, but now everyone is pissed that an assisted bike is a motorized bike and now you can't ride that anywhere, even the parks that allow bikes! There is no winning. There is no pleasing everyone. This is my entire point. Nobody is more or less entitled to the road than anyone else. The fact that we develop infrastructure *solely* for cars, because so many people choose a car over other means of transportation, is annoying to me. The fact that you are now stuck behind a bike rider on a road that we developed with zero thought given to the bike rider is annoying to you. This is where we are, and we need to learn to deal with it. I avoid Dupont during hunting season (or wear hi-vis when I go) because I know the hunters are trying to enjoy their hobby.
