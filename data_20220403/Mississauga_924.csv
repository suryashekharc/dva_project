"Did they say it is ""ok"" or did they say that what you showed them is not a crime.

There is a big difference.   In Canada everything is legal unless there is a [law](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/) against it. The police recommend charges to the Crown (prosecutor) who then decide whether to lay criminal charges.   If they think there is no chance of a conviction, well,  then it  isn't going any farther as far as an arrest in concerned,  no matter how many people are offended by someone's behaviour.

However, an investigation is definitely warranted if a child is in danger.

Do you have evidence of him knowingly trying to lure a 14 year old?  That is certainly  illegal.

If you didn't show them evidence, well, I certainly understand why you aren't happy you didn't get them interested. This is a big deal for you today, and nothing special to the police who have to make decisions like this 100 times a day. 

Reality is resources are limited. Would you vote to give Peel police more money to hire more officers? Doesn't sound like it.

There are organizations who attempt to trap pedophiles. Perhaps one can help you gather evidence that this guy is doing something illegal?

Until then he is innocent in the eyes of the law.  And your post will probably be removed for similar reasons by reddit.

"Speaking as a McMaster grad, there was actually a civil engineering course on Hamilton traffic lights. And the short answer as to why it works is: **one way streets**. 

I've put my car on cruise control and driven from the 403 out to Wentworth, hitting every single yellow light along the way. And it was great. But unless you're willing to (re)lay out the city grid in terms of one way streets, as Hamilton has, it's incredibly difficult to time lights properly.

My professor showed the math, and unless you like doing second order differential calculus equations (I don't), street light timing is a major pain in the ass. There are different criteria for major and minor traffic arteries, and different calculations for major/major, major/minor, minor/major, and minor/minor intersections. And **then** you have to factor in the disruptions caused by ambulance/fire/police traffic that overrides the timed lights and causes havok.

It's not that Mississauga laid things out to be difficult, it's that Hamilton strictly imposed rules that allowed them to time the lights. But those restrictions are probably impossible to impose in Mississauga.",t2_bo3jhd,billdehaan2,0,1648860356.0,0,t1_i31yde3,i31yde3,True,Youknowthe,t3_tu5f1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississauga/comments/tu5f1t/saving_the_world_starting_with_traffic_lights_in/,"Saving the world, starting with traffic lights in mississauga.",/r/mississauga/comments/tu5f1t/saving_the_world_starting_with_traffic_lights_in/i31yde3/,91,r/mississauga,0,91

"Side bar on the PATH concept expansion:
The PATH as it stands right now should be ready for an expansion North, dunno if planned but should be.

To the North, it currently ends at the Bay Atrium and 10 Dundas st. Beyond that, there is a smol path going from the Aura tower at Gerrard into college park. These two paths should be connected as there's only 3 blocks separating them.

Further beyond that, there's a ""PATH"" more North in Yorkville, that includes Bay and Yonge-Bloor subway stations.

Now that Yonge St, South of Bloor, is turning into a bunch of condos, this is an excellent opportunity to connect the PATH all the way from Bay and Queens Quay, to Yonge and Bloor. Obviously will take some time and the smaller properties along the Yonge strip need to buy in, but just imagine being able to walk from Union all the way to Yorkville come winter.

"I recall sitting around enough people going on about being ""world class"".

Having too early of a 'last call' at bars and drinking hours.

No 24 hour subways.

No this that or some other thing.

I remember the ferris wheel, monorail, casinos and portlands mall were generally panned too.

All of it was more or less attempts at copying other cities to say ""Come see us.  We're like them too!"" and not making life any better for those that are already here.

10-20 years later, I'm pretty certain that a livable city for its citizens where it can minimize anxiety and uncertainty about staying here leads to confidence and a relaxed mindset to explore hobbies and past times.    People coming together, sharing it and growing it.

I recall learning the cycle was new neighbourhood, young families growing old and decaying.  Poorer but artistic youth come in and rejuvenate.  Those artists grow older and make money that attracts more money.    Areas like Yorkville, Queen West and Ossington happen.

Mississauga has a thing of just inviting corporate interests to host events and puts on the appearance of public support.   (Square 1 Caribbean festival with lots of fancy ass food trucks and no representation from the businesses down the road at 5/10, I'm looking at you).",t2_85929,wing03,0,1648819149.0,0,t1_i2zaci2,i2zaci2,False,oldfashionedpancake,t3_ts0878,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississauga/comments/ts0878/what_are_yall_thoughts_on_this_guys_opinion_on/,What are y’all thoughts on this guy’s opinion on the city?,/r/mississauga/comments/ts0878/what_are_yall_thoughts_on_this_guys_opinion_on/i2zaci2/,1,r/mississauga,0,1

I suppose what’s surprising is that someone was thinking that at all. My parents generation (boomers) is completely oblivious to the flaws in our built environment. 

I say they’re oblivious from experience in discussing relevant topics e.g. growth Ponzi scheme, 40 000 deaths to cars in the US annually, physical inactivity which I argue in part comes from car dependent built environments.

"Someone attempted to do a similar scam yesterday around Oceans parking lot in Hurontario/Eglinton.

&#x200B;

A person asked me for help because he couldn't pay for his pizza. The car had a dominos logo on top. So I assumed it's a dominos pizza delivery. He said he only had cash and his apple pay won't work. He said that he would give me $20 and the pizza was like $11. Then I talked to the delivery driver and he said that the tap doesn't work. Credit card has a charge of $4 but debit doesn't. I knew it's kinda sketchy already but I played along.

&#x200B;

I gave my debit card and as soon as the delivery guy took it, the other person started talking to me and thinking I would look straight to him. But I stared at the delivery person and I saw him switch my card.

&#x200B;

I took his pin pad and I said ""This is not my card.""

&#x200B;

The delivery guy said ""That's what you gave me."" I took out the card and it's someone else's name. They kept insisting I gave that card to them.

&#x200B;

I told him I saw him switch the card and he kept insisting he did not.

&#x200B;

He knew I was on him so he just gave me my card and ran off. I memorized the number of my card so I know the card he gave back was mine. He then drove off.

"This is key, you really need to look into the finances of the condo corp for older condos. Did they do capital improvements in phases or is the roof on the building 40 years old and needs to be replaced asap.

Why are the condos fees set the way they are? If they are low that might mean they aren’t collecting enough and don’t have a lot in reserve, If they are really high maybe there are major expenses coming up, etc.

What kind of amenities do the condos have? Pool, theatre, bowling alley etc? All that stuff costs money to maintain. More renters than owner occupied? Probably increased maintained? Find the condo on short term rentals like air bnb or booking.com? Avoid like the plague.

"If he grew up there, his sentiment makes sense. He doesn't see it for what it offered people that moved there, he only sees it for what it doesn't offer him. 

You hit the nail on the head as far as I am concerned.

"Maybe you want to live in the quiet suburbs, but that's not what everyone wants, and even worse - the vast majority of people don't even have the option to live in anything other than a single-family-home (SFH) in a suburb that requires you to drive EVERYWHERE, often even to school.

Do you have any idea what this does? It means that people have to put up with housing taking up an unnecessarily large part of their budget, it means that almost everyone needs a car to hold down a job (that's why you see widened driveways everywhere west of Toronto), and it actively excludes so many people (the very old, the young (<16 years), and anyone with disabilities that prevent them from driving) from participating in society in a meaningful, independent way.

Either people put up with ALL THAT, or they live in a concrete box in a sky. Tall-and-sprawl is not an optimal housing market nor is it conducive to infrastructure at a human scale that would build community (e.g. a town square, walkable streets).

And all of this fucks over low-income earners the most, who, as I mentioned before, almost always all need, on an individual basis, a private automobile (a depreciating asset) which requires **gas** to fuel it.

Thankfully I no longer need a car for daily life and am so much better off for it.

Edit: and one more thing - suburbs aren't even that great for curbing traffic - sure, inhabitants won't really be driving around to places **within** suburbs, and so the streets will be quieter, but they do drive outside of suburbs, and so they push the burden of traffic to other areas.

What happens is when it's time to put in an offer.

They do this as it is really competitive to purchase in the GTA.

"Agreed.

Lots of roads and stroads in Mississauga.

Toronto wrung its hands about being a ""world class city"" 20 years ago and toyed with monorails and a big ass ferris wheel.

World class, in my opinion, should mean that it's livable by its citizens and have a wide swath of socio economic tiers.   Not just the rich and rich tourists.   Livable for a wide swath means that cost isn't prohibitive for shelter, food and work.   That people have time to take in hobbies and interests that would come to help define how others see the area.

I'm guessing the densification around Square One is trying to make up for the mistakes of promoting sprawl for the last 50 or so years.  It's going to be another 20 or 30 before we see things settle and what that brings.

"Look at it as what Long Island is to NYC?   

Urban sprawl, you need a car to get around quickly, lots of big corporate commercial and retail and less mom and pop (it is there but Smart Centers and the mostly generic selection of stores/restaurants totally dominate the landscape).  Yeah, there are mom and pops in the Smart Centers but with SmartCenters, they need to dress the part and look like big chain retail and food.

North Toronto, downtown, Beaches, Junction, places I've lived or family/friends there.   I've got family down in Queens and Brooklyn, NY.   You can walk out the door and within 5 minutes, there's most of what you need.   Mississauga-Oakville has a lot in common with Long Island.

They're mostly to show off people's ability to buy the proverbial white picket fenced home (or whatever it's evolved to these days), place to park the car(s) and the summer weekend fishing boat in the driveway.   Spend those 5 minutes driving to get out of your sprawling neighbourhood and wait another 3 or 4 minutes at the light of the big intersection before you get in to the area mall with the grocery store that anchors it.

">*Do I and a few others have it wrong that piri piri chicken is the same and Portugese chicken?*

It really depends on where you are.

The Portuguese and Dutch have been fighting over piri piri (Portuguese name) or peri peri (Dutch name) for centuries. The original word is Swahili, by the way; *peri* translates to ""pepper"", and *periperi* translates to ""chili pepper"" or ""spicy pepper"". 

The pepper is indigenous to southern Africa, so both the Dutch colony of South Africa and the Portuguese colony of Mozambique had it in abundance. But while the ""colonials"" in South Africa loved it, it didn't go over as well when it was brought to the Netherlands (it's overwhelmed by Indonesian food there), but the Portuguese went for it in a big way.

However, there are several types of ""Portuguese Chicken"" dishes, many of which predate the Portuguese going to Mozambique. There is Chorizo Chicken, and a few chicken stews that also go by the name ""Portuguese Chicken"", depending on where you are.

Here in Canada, the most notable name in terms of peri peri chicken is [Nando's](https://www.nandos.ca), which is unabashedly South African. Don't call it ""Portuguese Chicken"" in there. 😀",t2_bo3jhd,billdehaan2,0,1648592255.0,0,t1_i2miz9m,i2miz9m,True,wing03,t3_tr9otj,https://www.reddit.com/r/mississauga/comments/tr9otj/piri_piri_chicken_vs_portugese_chicken/,Piri piri chicken vs Portugese chicken,/r/mississauga/comments/tr9otj/piri_piri_chicken_vs_portugese_chicken/i2miz9m/,6,r/mississauga,0,6
