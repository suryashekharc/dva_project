"1. Pretty easy way is if they have an email address associated with the club/hotel you're trying to book at.
2. Yes. Only deal with hosts, or director level positions if possible. Promoters are different in Vegas than any other city in that their primary responsibility is guestlist. Hosts deal with tables.
3. Payment could be required in the form of a pre-authorization which will get sent to you directly from the club. Don't pay an independent host or anyone else up front for a table.
4. They may or may not be, depends on how much you're spending or how much you're tipping
5. All tables come with waitresses, tables include gratuity for the waitress. Host tip is separate. Also tip your busser.
6. Typically no, it's a minimum spend on alcohol. That being said, you can tip more for a better table location in some instances rather than having a bigger minimum spend.

"The best course of action is to **NOT** contact the Bluemoon Bar or the hotel and casino property first, as they'll say ""You need to call your bank or credit card company to settle your credit card issue."" So call your financial institution first, whether it's with your bank or credit card company first. Try to have them clear that fraud issue out, first.

The same happened to me when I first had my new Debit with BofA and purchased gas with it at my local Costco. It was locked until I had called the bank to clear some ""suspicious charges"" on it. So clear the fraud issue with your bank or credit card company first.

Plus, if you call the Bluemoon Bar to discuss the fraudulent charge on your credit card, they'll most-likely **won't know what you're talking about** and they'll tell you what I said earlier in this comment ""You need to call your bank or credit card company first."" It's your bank or credit card company that decides to approve/deny and determines if the charges made on/with your card are either legitimate/fraudulent, **NOT** the Bluemoon Bar.

Don't listen to the idiots below, who are telling you to call the Bar that you went to or the Hotel Company that owns and operates the bar. By applying their advice, you're not going to progress in settling your issue, going through their methods. Those people meant well and tried, but they failed in trying to help you out, their advice will only frustrate you more and they'll have this sense of happiness that they feigned assistance to somebody that truly needed it. **To be honest**, they just hope that you and your friend are too gullible to realize their advice of ""calling the bar and raise hell"" was and is a very stupid advice to tell somebody.

Staying at Caesars in July.   Wanted to get a cabana;  wife and I do that when we go to Vegas each summer.  We've never stayed at Caesars before, so  I go to book a cabana.  Now, for example, at Wynn, if a cabana lists for $400 a day, it's $400.  No fees, etc.

We drove from the Paris to the Flamingo last night because it was too difficult to navigate just a few doors up on the same side of the street.  We ended up on the side entrance of Bally's that doesn't have a curb ramp and I almost got hit by a car trying to lift the scooter over the curb.

-A slot machine where every ‚Äúspin‚Äù is just a giant statue slamming into a rock. Break the rock, get a prize. Move on to the next rock. It‚Äôs literally just a slot without any lines or symbols & it‚Äôs fascinating. I‚Äôve only seen it at Caesar‚Äôs by the food court.
-Not that weird, just a fun IP, but is did see a TNG themed slot that was a lot of fun. It‚Äôs gone from Cosmo now though.

Folk punk mostly as of late like Pat the Bunny, Harley Poe, 37 Cents, AJJ. But I've always been into DIY punk like NOFX. Lots of 3rd wave ska like Reel Big Fish, Less Than Jake, Aquabats, etc. I enjoy Hieroglyphics, Deltron 3030, Jurrasic 5. Early 2000's hiphop mostly. And I really enjoy Sia's and Lady Gaga's records.

"I used to be a daily tournament regular prior to the pandemic.  I always preferred tournaments to cash games for a number of reasons, but that's another post for another thread.

As some have mentioned here, most places that will have cash games will offer a $1/$2 or $1/$3 blind no limit cash game, and either a $2/$4 or $3/$6 limit hold em cash game.  Yes, Bravopoker is going to be a great source for that kind of information.

But, you can't just use Bravo.  Bravo is great for the rooms that use Bravo, and completely ignores the rooms that don't.  Plus, the ability to search/filter tournaments is dogshit.  To get the complete poker picture in Vegas at any given time, Bravo should be supplemented with PokerAtlas.  Sahara, Resorts World, and Westgate are exclusively PokerAtlas properties.  And the upcoming tournament page is clutch.  

I should also point out that the World Series of Poker will be just kicking off during that time.  So realistically, you could park at the WSOP in the Bally's/Paris convention center and not worry about anything else.  You'll find the cash games and sit-n-gos you want, but the price points might be a bit higher than what you're looking for (last I remember, smallest SNGs are $130, and only pay out in tournament lammers).  

But, to answer your specific questions:  

- $60 at South Point (as someone else pointed out)
- $75 at Bally's (assuming these are running during the WSOP)
- $35 at Westgate
- $60 at Sahara

Any of those should scratch your itch for tournament poker.  Keep in mind, none of these will be ""good"", meaning you won't get as many chips (typically 10k-15k instead of 20k+) and the blind levels will be shorter (15 minutes instead of 20-30 minutes).  But they'll do the trick.  If you play any of these tournaments with a mindset other than ""I'm going to punt $60 for 2-3 hours of poker fun"", you're going to be miserable.

"Some industries offer employees high wages and good benefits without union representation. (Whole Foods and major tech companies in Silicon Valley for example.) Other industries have terrible wages and benefits without Unions and desperately need Unions (Walmart, Amazon.) Sometimes Unions have unreasonable demands that refuse to budge and bring down entire corporations. (Hostess and Detroit Auto Manufacturers) Sometimes Unions can be a great remedy to inept and corrupt management, other times they shoot themselves in the foot and do more harm than good to the members they represent. Much of the decline of Union representation has been partly self-inflicted, but myopic CEOs deserve some of the blame as well. Unions, like management are not all created equal. They are not a cure all for every industry. In particular situations they are a great check against employers, other times they create imbalances that are not good for the economy.

"All I know is that my family has worked on the Strip for 30+ years, they are Culinary union members and the union has given them great benefits. Both my parents along with some other family members are now retired with a decent pension. Culinary has the best health insurance in town, I've experienced it personally being on my parents plan and then being kicked off at 26 and moving to my employer's plan definitely sucked. Another benefit that I believe Culinary workers have is apparently you have to work a minimum 4 hour shift, so if management send you home early before those 4 hours you have to get paid a minimum 4 hours. I was always jealous of that benefit as a non-union worker on the Strip when I would get sent home early on slow days.

"The unions in Vegas tend to not err towards greed or corruption, they actually fight for the workers here. If a manager asks you to clock out and clean up your station (which has happened at my casino), you can fight it and get back pay and more. Culinary 226 and Bartender 165 provide health insurance, dental, and vision at no additional cost beyond the monthly $49, as long as you work a minimum of 30 hours a week. When I worked in an office, my health insurance, just the health part, not dental or vision, started at $400 a month before any co-pays. They also make the casino pay into a pension. The benefits heavily outweigh any negative aspects. Standards and limitations apply to not doing anything outside your job. Like cleaning the bar. One of the main values of the union is you are hired to do one job, not someone else's job. I heavily advise joining. Some unions don't do anything for their employees, ours do everything to protect us. You'd have to call the union to see if they'll allow you to join at a later date, but I'm fairly certain you have to make a decision close to hiring date.

"Tacos El Gordo if you like greasy tortillas hand made sloppy but delicious

Taco y Taco if you like the not so drenched in oil tortilla. Cleaner eats but not as flavorful

If you have a chance hit Tacos El Tizon on eastern and Tropicana they serve really good authentic Mexican food.

El birrotazo in the east side if you want the BEST Birria I'm Las Vegas.

Pepes tacos is Roberto's if it was better meat and more authentic on flamingo and rainbow or Boulder.(Sopes are out of this world.

Los tacos is pretty good I think they're owned by Roberto'S tacos last time I ordered it it shows up on my card as Roberto's.(same as Taco Y Taco)

There's also a taco stand on Bonanza and las Vegas Blvd that has the BEST mullitas I've had. Scary area though for most people

Patty's Tamales are amazing tamales too you should check those out too not sure if it's still open.

 Frijoles on Tropicana and rainbow IF the fat guys cooking that man can cook. If there's a skinny guy cooking very bland.

And if your health Conscious there also Tacorarian Vegan Tacos it's ok but not Mexican food.


Each Mexican spot has a specialty from what I've noticed hopefully this helps these are my thoughts as a VERY picky eater.

* Go to a resort that y'all probably won't hit and spend some time eating/drinking/gambling there.  Staying at Mandalay Bay?  Go to Sahara, the Strat, Resorts World and kill some time there with drinks and gambling.
* Not long before they get there, run to the liquor story, grocery story, dispensary, whatever and grab provisions.  Get everyone to pay you back + $3-5pp for your troubles.  You're the candy man.

"Hi! We just lived in Vegas for the winter in our RV, we stayed at Las Vegas RV resort. It‚Äôs right next to all the other off strip RV parks, it‚Äôs not in the best area but it has 24/7 gated security that walk around all night and have security at the front gate. 

We lived there for six months and had zero issues! Our neighbors were really friendly, it has a heated pool, Hot tub, laundry and really nice shower house and multiple dog parks. It was fairly cheap too, $600/month for a fancy spot.

Circa is one of my favorite casinos but only because I'm a sports junkie. The sportsbook is probably the best I've ever seen. The drinks are pricey for downtown but you can always buy drinks and snacks in the gift shop including cheaper prices on beer and they allow you to eat and drink them in the sportsbook.  If you leave circa and walk around downtown obviously everything becomes a lot cheaper. The security staff will breathe down your neck and I'm pretty sure they are strict to the waitresses about giving free drinks. The machines by the sportsbook do spit out free drink tickets if you gamble enough. If you go here on a big sporting event you will be out of luck for a seat unless you book ahead of time. Massage staff always on duty in the sportsbook area. They do have one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life on the 2nd floor of the sportsbook. Overall the only complaint I have is the security staff. You will see 20 different security guards before you see your first waitress which is very annoying cuz they always creep up from behind you every other minute but I guess that can be a good thing if you are worried about encountering any danger downtown,t2_540y1yb9,jayhbar,0,1648758584.0,0,t1_i2w7xv0,i2w7xv0,True,random503,t3_tsta0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/tsta0h/what_is_circas_rep_at_this_point/,what is circa's rep at this point?,/r/vegas/comments/tsta0h/what_is_circas_rep_at_this_point/i2w7xv0/,1,r/vegas,0,1

>Every arena says it's going to be built without tax money, until they need the tax money and then the governor can't sign the checks fast enough

When the amount of arenas that received public funds was one. 

You've implied that this project is going to receive public funds but you've ignored a major factor that makes that basically impossible.  It's a casino project with an arena attached. It's not a stand alone arena. 

Then you've realized you aren't landing your points so you resort to personal attacks rather than making a real point. When that happens, you basically admit that you've lost the debate. Your entire argument has been based on fear rather than facts.
