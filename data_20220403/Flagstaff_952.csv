The Nosy Nancies in the neighborhood ratted them out to the HOA (wrongly, as I understand) and the HOA went after them with a vengeance as they often do, giving them a violation notice for renting their home out and not declaring it or paying the fees required to do so. The reality of the situation was that they happened to have a large family gathering over a number of days, so there was an unusual amount of traffic at the property, as I understand it.

When the HOA was busted for falsely accusing them, they stood down, but the damage was done.

Part of the problem in a community like this is the retirees who have too much time on their hands and want to play enforcer, reporting every tiny little breach that they perceive as a violation of the CC&Rs.",t2_cflwdbkh,MortonRalph,0,1648857117.0,0,t1_i31ry4a,i31ry4a,False,NatJeep,t3_tp08os,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tp08os/what_actions_could_flagstaffs_city_government/,What actions could Flagstaff’s city government take that would actually have a tangible effect on access to affordable housing?,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tp08os/what_actions_could_flagstaffs_city_government/i31ry4a/,1,r/Flagstaff,0,1

"There needs to be a new sandwich place honestly. The only good options are just OK or hit-or-miss quality. One of the weak points of the town IMHO. 

Proper Meats for instance lacks fresh condiments for a cold cut, the handcut, fresh cooked chips are often burnt and tasteless. Too much oil.

Crystal Creek the bread is often terrible, soggy or just plain subway-tier tasting sometimes.

"Jitters is my first choice. Great sandwiches without being too fussy, coffee drinks, bowtie pasta side is addictive, friendly, parking. 

Aspen Deli close second, but it was hard to get to when my downtown office job went remote. Similar menu to jitters but no coffee drinks. Super friendly local owners last time I went (they rescued the business after the original owner sold it to capitalist who never intended to reopen it).

Eat n Run third place. The sandwiches are a little more gourmet so I preferred the salads there, and the offer smoothies. The ""run"" part of their name is deceptive, if you want quick service, order ahead, lol

Look at places like Toptal, Braintrust, etc. I’m a UI designer and I haven’t had a traditional job in 10 years. I think people who have good remote jobs can handle the financial side of living in Flag easily.  

CO is great too, but in any metro area it can be a chore to get into the wilderness. Say, Denver, it can take hours to get to the closest ski resort, or so I’ve been told. In Flag I can be at the resort in 25 min, or on a running trail in 5 min.

Housing is definitely hard. Depending on your situation it could be a lot more doable, especially as a single person, but if you have a family it’s definitely hard.

Social scene could be limiting UNLESS you’re into an outdoor activity where there’s tons of community. Climbing, mountain biking, running and skiing are the big sports here and all of them have fun events built around them. Not a ton of restaurant options, but what we have is really good.

"Flagstaff is a small city of less than 100k people spread out over quite a lot of area, it has 1 hospital which is a good one, but in terms of healthcare your options are limited. The city is at elevation around 2000m above sea level which takes some adjusting.

Socially, it is primarily a college town with bars, small venues and such. If you like mountains and hiking you would have plenty to do.

Professionally, I can't recommend it though. The job market is very, very oriented to service industry with very few tech and salary positions available, most of which are in direct competition through graduating students. It's extremely difficult to build a career in Flagstaff. 

The housing market is brutal. High rent, massive competition, low wages, low availability. It isn't uncommon to see a good deal online be snatched up within an hour with dozens of replies. 

All on all, Flagstaff is a beautiful town and I fully recommend a visit but I can't recommend moving there at this time. Especially as an immigrant. Though flagstaff itself is tolerant in that respect, AZ doesn't have good social systems in place for residents, let alone immigrants.

"When I post stuff for sale on Facebook, 98% of the responses I get are scams or bots, so this does not really follow. I have far better luck on Craigslist. Yes, there are scams, but there are scam everywhere. I would not be surprised if the ""Craigslist is scammy"" reputation was purposeful astroturfing by Facebook to get people off of Craigslist. Most people I have heard complain about Craigslist scams don't even actually use Craigslist and have never tried. That is how I know that astroturfing is working. The problem is Facebook buying anyone else who tries to compete and shutting them down. You will also notice that the Marketplace on Facebook is terribly designed for a market place. No advanced search. No way to search specific terms. No way to organize results on the page. It is designed to get you to stay on as long as possible while barely being able to find what you want, just enough to get you to not click away in frustration. That way they can get the most ""click-throughs"" and ""retention."" They design it like shit on purpose because it is more profitable, you know, like any good marketplace would do. The real problem is that people just say ""eh, it is easier to use Facebook."" Well, congrats.

"I was happy with LIPS until almost the very end.  I lived at Flagstaff  Village and they got a bit shitty with me when I started asking questions about why they were letting SWAT teams practice raids on vacant apartments with minimal notice/were doing extensive surveying/not renting out recently vacated units.  I asked if they were in the process of selling the property and they outright denied it.   I wanted to get back on a lease (LIPS leases go month to month after 6 months, but can be renewed) because I wanted to protect myself and was encouraged not to push it. 

I can get why they wouldn’t confirm it, I guess, but it sucks that they gave tenants like 2 months to figure it out the day after the eviction moratorium ended in a market where affordable housing does not exist.  It left a bad taste in my mouth and I don’t know if I’d rent from them again. 

But… I could afford an apartment alone, which I hadn’t been able to do before.  It was very basic, but I didn’t have to have roommates.  Maintenance was responsive.  All utilities were included.  Just maybe don’t live in one of their buildings that they might sell and give you minimal notice to dip before they bulldoze it, I guess.  Like, I don’t know if I’d rent a unit in their spot on Santa Fe, for example, that’s valuable land.",t2_66wem,FuzzyManPeach,0,1648499027.0,0,t1_i2hc16z,i2hc16z,False,Zealousideal-Bet-263,t3_tprknk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tprknk/what_are_other_ways_to_find_a_place_to_rent_in/,What are other ways to find a place to rent in Flagstaff besides Craigslist.,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tprknk/what_are_other_ways_to_find_a_place_to_rent_in/i2hc16z/,2,r/Flagstaff,0,2

"I have a bit of an axe to grind with Bookman’s. I went in there and also immediately felt like it was a really cool place, but was super taken aback when I saw they were selling a copy of [The Protocols of the Elders of Zion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion) in their “rare books” case. The book is rare for a reason - the people who typically want to buy it (neo-Nazis) often have trouble because most reputable publishers and booksellers refuse to publish/carry it. Protocols is one of the most famous antisemitic texts in the world. It was produced in 1903 by an unknown author but it poses as basically meeting minutes from a supposed Jewish cabal plotting world domination. It’s been known to be a fabrication intended as antisemitic propaganda for over one hundred years, though that didn’t stop it from being taught to children in Nazi German as though it were factual. I recognized the title because I’d learned about it in a class I’d taken on the history of the Holocaust.

We brought it up to the manager because we thought they might not realize what they had (generous of us considering it was being sold for $80 in the rare books case), and he essentially told us he would not take it off the shelves. We even asked if he would consider at least sticking a disclaimer on it warning any potential readers that it was a proven forgery and should not be intended to be read at face value, but no dice. We returned the other stuff we’d bought and haven’t been back since.

Everyone obviously has the right and responsibility to make their own choices about what businesses and business practices they’re willing to support, but I’m not comfortable with a place that’s willing to make a buck off of dangerous antisemitic propaganda that’s still promoted credulously by modern day neo-Nazis.

All the people cooking at these places I’ve mentioned are from Mexico. Are they suddenly unable to cook the best Mexican food in the state because they live in Flagstaff? That’s silly. You obviously haven’t eaten at either of the places I’ve recommended- you are just gatekeeping as if the location a person cooks somehow changes their ability. 😬 All I did was promote local business with enthusiasm- you went out of the way to insult local restaurants and Flagstaff in general. ¡Qué vergüenza!,t2_4bi9qwqr,IndigoStef,0,1648426029.0,0,t1_i2dkoe5,i2dkoe5,False,ilovetittiesandjesus,t3_tn94x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tn94x7/most_authentic_mexican_food/,Most authentic mexican food?,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tn94x7/most_authentic_mexican_food/i2dkoe5/,1,r/Flagstaff,0,1

" I watched the same thing happen in San Jose/Silicon Valley over 30 years.  It's unclear the government has a motivation to do anything.  They'll pay lip service to those suffering rising rents and housing costs.  But as housing values soar - so do property taxes and thus, income for the city.   So while city representatives may act sympathetic, nobody argues with the rising tax revenues.

The result is a balkanization of the city into higher-priced, gated communities that strive ever more earnestly to separate themselves from lower priced areas that deteriorate.  You only have to look at what happened over the decades in San Jose to see the result.

"Wait, are you talking about a day starting and ending in Flagstaff and then Page the next day? Or you're coming into Flagstaff (from where?), spending the night, and doing all these things and driving to Page the same day?

Could you do petrified forest and/or walnut canyon on one day, and then detour into sunset crater and wupatki on the way to Page the next day?

You don't need tons of time at any of those places to appreciate them. Walnut Canyon has a couple miles worth of walking around, so maybe an hour there. Both Petrified Forest/Painted Desert and Wupatki/Sunset Crater take the form of a scenic drive with a series of 5-15 minute stops (maybe budget a couple hours worth of stops in case you want to picnic or hike a bit).

"Yes. It's a long day so start early. Drive to Wupatki first on the north side of the loop and then down through sunset crater. Wander around the Pueblo. Just drive through sunset crater, maybe take a view at the painted desert vista. Do the island loop at Walnut Canyon. Drive to Painted Desert/Petrified forest and grab lunch in Holbrook (I think Alibertos is a solid basic taco shop) on the way. Then don't turn around and backtrack. Head up through Dilkon to Page. Most of your day will be in the car except a few short walks. I'd estimate it to be a 12-14 hour day or so, so strap in for a marathon day of sightseeing in between driving.

"Sunset & Wupatki are on the same loop road so you may as well do both of them! Walnut Canyon is a bit closer to town. I think you could do all three if you got an early start and were intentional about your time - all three are open from 9-4:30 ish. The main trail at Walnut closes at 3:30 so I’d hit that first and then head to the others. There’s also a pass that’s $45 I think that gets you into all three Flagstaff Area National Monuments. Hikes at each of these are fairly short and the parks are all related to one another and it’s nice to get a fuller picture of what was going on here at that time. I’m a big fan.

That's just things I've encountered in the last six months. Not even mentioning the times a dog has chased my bike after I pass them on a trail.

"Best vegan/vegetarian spots imo are MartAnne’s Burrito Palace (Mexican), Red Curry (Thai), or Brandy’s Cafe (breakfast/lunch). Mama Burger has a really good locally made veggie burger and some dope shakes.

"I am so encouraged by your thoughtful post.  I am just a mom of 3 with extended family that has NEVER been supportive or helpful. May I start by saying that the Flagstaff area is going to be very difficult in terms of accessibility for anyone in a wheelchair.  We were up last weekend and one of our kids even commented on the streets being uneven and not very easy to be “steady” on.  It sounds like your sister-in-law has her hands full.  I think it might be the best case scenario to hire a babysitter to cover the kids who either can’t or shouldn’t attend certain events.  Maybe tap the NAU resources for a student who is training in the area of special education?  It would probably be money well spent and is likely the best way to allow for your other family members to have some down time.  Also remember your sister-in-law is rigidly schedule driven every day of her life. She may even appreciate the idea of just having a day or two where nothing is scheduled, but having a care giver on hand even on those days to help entertain the kids would allow her to relax but still in the mix enough to know the kids are being taken care of.

"If you are coming from the east, you can get a same day overnight permit for several different backcountry areas in the painted desert. There are no trails, but you can wander anywhere you want, it is a really unique experience!

Around Flagstaff, there are several smaller hikes off of the Wupatki/Sunset Crater loop that are of both cultural and geologic interest, have some great views, and are accessed off of paved roads.

A lot of the hikes in the pines have the forest service roads to them closed, though west of town on 180 there is a wildlife viewing area that has a paved parking area and a neat loop that goes through pines, an aspen grove, and along the edge of a ”park”, I cannot remember exactly how far it is, maybe a bit further past Snowbowl than Snowbowl is from town.

"So the Pit is off of lake Mary road and is a little west of walnut canyon. The parking area is around the following blurb from Mountain Project: “Drive south of Flagstaff on Lake Mary Road. The new Pit and Sandys Canyon Trail head is located just west on Lake Mary Rd. from the old parking area at Canyon Vista Campground. When driving out Lake Mary Rd. look for the dirt road just after the Hecketthorn neighborhood.”

I’d also recommend walking Kelly canyon by Kachina Village neighborhood and bring microspikes. Road may not be open though. 

OP, if you have a high clearance vehicle and go to Priest Draw, there’s nice flat trails that go back through the draw. It’s gorgeous too

I’m actually in Tucson now, my hometown. It’s much more affordable and has more of the Flagstaff vibe than Phoenix. But it doesn’t compare to Flagstaff IMO. Winters are amazing here but the summers can be rough. 

Despite the cost of living, flagstaff is a really cool place to live and I highly recommend sticking around there if you can swing it. There’s a lot of free dispersed camping available a few miles from town and it’s gorgeous (if not still very cold right now!). But do consider you may still have to contend with snowstorms for 2 more months so that could get complicated with camping. The following link will give you map that has dispersed camping marked on it. You can camp for 2 weeks at a time in one spot. Oh and Avenza is an app that will allow you to use the maps if you’d prefer that to a pdf :)

"Howdy, 

You definitely have a pretty solid itinerary already. If you have a car that is capable, check out the inner basin of the San Fransisco peaks - Shultz Pass is pretty popular (though, I am sure the recent snow might make that a little hard). A small hike I always enjoy doing is the Sinclair Wash Trail, on the urban trail system. It goes pretty far back into the forest, too, and has a fun little labyrinth near the trailhead!

If you’re looking for eats, Momma Burger has some solid diner-style burgers + fries. If you like pizza, NiMarcos is definitely work checking out. Pizzicelta is nice, but a bit pricey. Are you wanting to go to bars? In downtown I would recommend Dark Sky Brewery or Pay N’ Take. 

To answer your last question, I think it is more a City thing. I’ve lived in AZ my whole life (Phx for 18 years) and there’s nothing quite like Flagstaff anywhere else in this state. I personally think it’s the proximity to the largest pine forest in North America! Anyway, enjoy your trip!

"I know all of this because I went under contract last year to buy one of the few remaining parcels in that area. The original owners had bought it back in the early 2000s and got caught by the financial issues of 2008 which ended their efforts to develop the property from what we could see. They had been trying to sell it for some time at a greatly reduced price. We figured something was up due to the price, so we did a deep dive with the County regarding the parcel and the surrounding area which included the Rio de Flag waterway.

The County Community Development employees were extremely helpful in revealing a number of issues that would make building on the property a dicey affair even under the best circumstances, so we bailed. One of the things that the Environmental Engineering folks at the County provided us was the LIDAR survey they did. The owners of the parcel knew nothing about it, but we were kind enough to provide a copy to them so they could disclose it for the next buyer - and there was a ""next buyer"" who has gone so far as to permit a home and septic system on the property. It remains to be seen if they'll get approval, however.

We didn't see this as a viable option and didn't want to end up owning two acres of park land with a beautiful view.

"Federal flood plain maps are not updated with any regularity. What is, however, are local maps or elevation certificates. These are the only real ""source of truth"" when it comes to flood plain information relative to a given parcel.

Even better, the County conducted a LIDAR survey of the Ft. Valley area in 2015, and as a result, made significant changes to the required setbacks for the Rio de Flag waterway, rendering a number of parcels unbuildable due to their proximity to the waterway.

While there are plenty of homes being built in that broad meadow, it WILL flood again and again, however, the 100 year mark is considered something like one or two feet above the ground, so as long as the home's floor is one foot above the flood level, you're good to go.

"Hey there, just wanted to let you know that your information may be inaccurate.

According to the City of Flagstaff, there’s 5 new wells planned within the City over the next 10 years. The City is estimates we are currently using 66% of the sustainable aquifer. Sustainable defined as what volume of water Flagstaff could pump and be continually sustained for 100 years without negative consequences to the environment. The estimate is based on research by USGS, Arizona Department of Water Resources, and a 3rd party consultant.

Additionally, the McAllister Well and Pumphouse (West Flag) came online in February 2021. This was followed immediately by the completion of a new well at Ft Tuthill (Fort Tuthill #2).

Hope this helps!

"I take exception to a couple of points you've made:

1.) An increase in interest rates, short of being multiple points, will only take people on the fringes of the market out of the running. Most buyers who are qualified will continue to be in the market, albeit at a possibly slightly lower price point. A change in a point in mortgage rates isn't that big of a shift for most.

2.) Look at many of the home sales in Flagstaff and you'll see that quite a few are likely cash sales. Cash is king, and with people coming from outside the area where property values were even higher, such as CA or WA, for example, a mortgage isn't an issue, or if it is, it's likely for far less than the property value as the buyer are bringing their equity. That or the buyer is an institutional investor buying the property as an investment (rental).  


The ""doom and gloom"" just isn't there. This is likely the new normal for some years to come until inventory increases in most markets. There will be more pressure in markets like Flagstaff due to the limitations imposed by a lack of land for development and a strong market for investment properties - this will likely never change.

As an aside, many companies with brick and mortar are realizing that a benefit in high demand by job seekers is the ability to work remotely. As a result, the effort to continue with a remote workforce will remain high and may even increase over time, I believe. A former employer has recently changed their policies in regard to remote work because they realized candidates were choosing other employers due to the potential for having to return to work in the office with this employer.",t2_cflwdbkh,MortonRalph,0,1647881756.0,0,t1_i1ju0oa,i1ju0oa,False,Dirty_Boat_Boy,t3_tj467j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tj467j/flagstaff_housing_march_2022/,Flagstaff Housing - March 2022,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tj467j/flagstaff_housing_march_2022/i1ju0oa/,2,r/Flagstaff,0,2

"I’m 20 minutes east of Flag with zero options other than expensive satellite with terrible reviews.  I preordered Starlink when I moved here in August, but I’m still waiting. The T-Mobile home internet was available here a few months ago, but when I finally decided to pull the trigger, it wasn’t. I know some people have it and love it. I guess it was only available to a limited number of households, but I’m not sure it would work for me anyway.  We had T-Mobile phones when we moved here. We had 5g with great download speeds, but nearly 0 upload, and lots of dropped calls. 

I have heard good things about Bluespan. I’m not sure where in Flagstaff they are available, but I was impressed when I tried to sign up and they sent me a personal apology for not being out here. They are in the process of expanding. 

Here’s what I did that works: 

I signed up for Visible wireless on a cheap Android phone. Join a ‘party’, and the service is $25/month. You get unlimited hotspot for one device at a time- so that’s a Wi-Fi extender. With the cheapest home WeBoost cell signal booster, It gets 4 bars LTE, 5 if sitting directly on the booster.  I’m in the middle of nowhere- the Visible phone gets good 5g in town.

All the gadgets - Roomba, Ring Cameras, etc are on that extender’s Wi-Fi.  We can usually stream one tv too, but occasionally it doesn’t want to cooperate.  

When the ‘Wi-Fi phone’ is too overloaded, my husband streams tv from his Visible phone hotspot with no problem.  I work from home and tether mine to the computer.  Everything works but Zoom meetings, which are glitchy unless I turn my video off.  Boss requires video on, so I added a few gigs of prepaid T-Mobile data on dual sim and solved that.

"That’s fair. I support law enforcement, I understand why the forest gets shut down and it’s unfortunate and bad for the forest in my opinion. I do understand that many forest fires are caused by humans, but even if they were natural we do our best to stop the fire because somebody built their house in the middle of a forest. The forest needs to burn, preferably naturally and not human caused. But it needs to burn. We are already in a drought but these fires will keep coming  back and worse until it’s burned. Look at California/Oregon those trees need to burn, it’s part of a cycle and those fires have gotten very dangerous.

"The state yes.  And as I understand it Alaska has borough's instead of counties. Coconino would be the 13th largest Borough in Alaska.  As it stands it's the 2nd largest county in the US by area. 

But Alaska is also much wetter than Coconino.  Alaska as a whole gets 31-35 inches of precipitation annually it looks like.  Coconino as a whole gets around 15 inches annually.  Obviously this changes based on where you are at.  Flagstaff gets more than some other areas.  But there are parts of Alaska that get over 100 inches of rain annually. So I'm kinda using just the overall averages here.  

It gets harder to prove a point one way or another here as well, because I just don't have the data.  How many enforcement people do each of those borough's have? And how does that relate to the number of people who go out in said areas.  Are the areas that people typically go out to enjoy just a small portion of that borough? I would think there are parts of the Yukon borough people are more inclined to be visiting and camping in. 

As of 2019 Coconino county had around 65 certified deputies.  Reminder that these deputies have to also serve as the general policing force for the small towns around the county as well (such as Munds Park). And it appears there are around 20 forest rangers for enforcement.  Search and Rescue is almost all volunteers.  

With more funding having people self report may be possible.  But I know, from experience, that if you call 911 from Munds Park a deputy will take anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.  And if you call the non-emergency line, they may show up next day.  They have a local fire department, but they aren't equipped for going deep into the forest if need be.  They are primarily emergency services for the homes and their stretch of the freeway.",t2_nxl1y,Bluewolf83,0,1647295691.0,0,t1_i0o905m,i0o905m,False,corpseplague,t3_tdcflr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Flagstaff/comments/tdcflr/what_is_your_guess_when_the_forest_roads_will_open/,What is your guess when the forest roads will open?,/r/Flagstaff/comments/tdcflr/what_is_your_guess_when_the_forest_roads_will_open/i0o905m/,1,r/Flagstaff,0,1

"I mean, if the forest service and the county had the manpower to respond to the amount of calls it would get maybe.  But the county sheriff and the forest service have 1.85 million acres (Coconino National Forest) or 18600 square miles (Coconino County) of area.  

I also tend to agree that the ones who are ignoring the campfire regulations are probably also not caring about road closures. But I would argue that the forest being open can also lead to the possibility of not being able to evacuate people in time.  Fires move fast when it's dry. 

It's second hand and anecdotal, but I have been told it's easier to evacuate out people illegally in the forest. And that it's easier to spot the rule breakers from helicopter when there's fewer people out there.

"I grew up here.  I have lived here over 25 years.  I don't mind people ""exploring the trees"" as you put it.  I want people to enjoy the forest as I have done and continue to do to this day.  

But I believe the safety of the Flagstaff populations takes precedence over those who come up here to camp, yes.  Why? Because myself, and others, constantly see those who come up to enjoy the forest, have no care for the forest, or any care for those who have to actually deal with the outcomes of their decisions.  Because I haven't seen any of them up here filling or placing sandbags to deal with flooding from a human caused wildfire; or helping neighbors to pack up and evacuate their homes.

Not unlike in the winter, when the people who come up to enjoy the forest are also the ones leaving broken sleds just lying around for us locals to clean up. I have seen where they just throw their trash on the ground. Or perhaps they are the ones ignoring the blocked forest service roads because they just have to take their ATV out in the forest, ripping up the roads, and destroying the land. Or is it the people parking on roads illegally, even when told not to, and dying. 

They are the same people who come up here and start fires.  Like I posted elsewhere, last year over the Memorial day weekend there were near 80 illegal campfires that were discovered by the county and forest service.  That's just in 3 days.

And you know what, those were on years when we far more snow than this year (though still far less than annual average).

Looking at these links we should average 100+ inches of snowfall.  As of today we are at 54.4 inches since September 1st.  We should be closer to 76 inches at this point in time.  That's near two feet of snow we are short on.  That also does not include how much warmer and drier it has been this winter outside of those few storms, which have prematurely caused our snowpack to melt off.

Does that mean they won't open, no.  I suspect the forest service and the county will open for memorial day, like they do every year to grab the tourists.  [2021 80 illegal campfires over memorial day weekend](http://gcmaz.com/kaff-news/kaff-news/coconino-national-forest-reports-nearly-80-illegal-campfires-over-memorial-day-weekend/) Even with being under no campfire restrictions, fines, and possible jail time; we still see campfires and the beginning of possible major fires almost every year.  And that doesn't include any lightning sparked fires.

I was 19 in 2002 as the Rodeo-Chedeski fire (June 18) burned up 300000 acres threatening the eastern half of N. AZ and was caused by humans. I was watching on 2006 from work as the Brins Mesa Fire (June 18) burned up Oak Creek Canyon, caused by humans. I remember and have helped to deal with the aftermath of the Schultz fire (June 20) from 2010, started by humans. I was here in 2014 when the Slide fire (May 20) happened and burned up the canyon, started by humans. In 2021 I watched the Slate fire (June 7, humans likely cause) and the Rafael Fire (June 18, lightning) threaten Flagstaff and my friends and family.  And those are just the major fires. This is not counting the many small fires, only a few acres that we get multiple of, per year, [60-100 according to the City of Flagstaff](https://www.flagstaff.az.gov/DocumentCenter/View/44186).

I also have friends who are firefighters in and around Flagstaff.  I have friends whose parents were firefighters and fire chiefs in Flagstaff in my teenage years.  I watched as they had friends die in the Yarnell Hill fire in 2013.

So you will have to forgive me if I don't wish to see my forest, which I love and have enjoyed for 25 years, go up in flames due to the stupidity of others. That I don't wish to see my home, my family's home and my friends homes threatened by fire yet again. That I don't wish to have to explain to my son, daily, why we can't go outside due to the air conditions (smoke) from a fire caused by some dumbasses, or that the reason mommy and daddy are nervous is because we are at a yellow (set) stage  of evacuation from that fire (Rafael Fire).

"When the forest service deems it safe for both people and the forest to do so.  They don't want people in there while it's too wet destroying the ground and they don't want people getting stuck that they have to rescue.

On the flip side, we have had so little snow this year, they may decide not to open at all due to the major increased fire risk, especially after last year's fire season and the fact we had Flagstaff on ready to evacuate/evacuated.  

Usually they don't open until early May at the earliest, often not until a couple weeks into May.  I will be honest, I'm hoping they don't open up, and that the fines are quite large for those who break the rules (there are many who ignore the closures every year because they feel they don't apply to them and their atv's and/or campers).

"There is no great espresso in town. Firecreek used to be basically okay, but it's gone way downhill. Everywhere else is deeply mediocre. I don't really understand how a town can have so many semi-snooty coffee shops and yet really no good espresso at all.

If you want a tasty espresso drink, Macy's Special is a good mocha; a dirty golden milk at Kickstand is nice, too; perfectly adequate lattes at Late for or Lux or Firecreek. Realistically, just about anywhere w baristas who can steam milk competently can make a good espresso drink.

The lack of basically decent actual espresso, though, has not stopped being puzzling to me. Drier air? Harder water? Not a lot of baristas who care about espresso? Shitty roasting technique?
