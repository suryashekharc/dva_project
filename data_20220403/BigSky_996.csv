"It‚Äôs spring which means things are going to be soft and slushy all over. I‚Äôve posted this in a few other posts in this sub - here‚Äôs my favorite order for people new to Big Sky:


start on Ram 8 and hit Lizette and Pomp. Then burn one down Elk Park. Come back to the front side of Andesite and grab Blue Room or War Dance. Go up Swifty 6 and get Soul Hole then Buff Jump. Go up Powder Seeker and hit every line in the bowl. Exit Chute has some shark teeth but it‚Äôs also skiing really well. Magic Forest is fun. Then go up Challenger - I like to suggest people stick to the Moonlight bumps if you don‚Äôt know the area. Then work you way to Iron Horse via Blue Moon. From there explore Elk Horn, Meriweather and then go up Lone Tree to Horseshoe.

"+1 for the museum of the Rockies. There is almost literally nothing to do in Big Sky if you don‚Äôt ski. You can catch a movie at the Independent, maybe play trivia one of the nights you‚Äôre in town, spend 20 minutes going to all the shops in town‚Ä¶ ice skate at the rink if it‚Äôs still operational‚Ä¶ go to the community center (gym)‚Ä¶ head to West for an IMAX movie and to check out the wolf discover center‚Ä¶ Maybe do a yurt dinner with your group if there is availability?

"Just skied my first ever at Big Sky as an intermediate skier, so I don't feel worth of making a report, but I will do it in the spirit of spacebass' interest in this being a crowdsourced effort!

We had a group of 8 with some intermediate and beginners, so lots of time spent coordinating kids, etc. But the skiing we did get in was awesome!  There is still some firm patches out there but overall lots of nice powder and soft fluffy snow. 

&#x200B;

Here's what we did:

&#x200B;

RAMCHARGER

Silver Knife - love this run, and really nice snow pretty much all the way down. 

Elk Park Ridge - love this run even more, and really nice snow

Tipsy's - similar to Silver Knife, except it has a mogul section at the end with smallish disorganized moguls that weren't too tough. 

Africa - to be honest we didn't love this as much as spacebass, haha. Pretty thin snow compared to other runs we did today so moguls weren't a lot of fun. 

Pacifier - didn't seem to collect much snow so still fairly thin, so to me I'd pass on this one

SOUTHERN COMFORT

El Dorado - nice snow all the way down, very enjoyable

Sacajawea - to me, it had the best snow we saw today, except for the bottom part which has some hard patches. Loved this run today.

There will be a race tomorrow on Hangmans so it will be closed.

Silver knife is lovely and is a great groomer. The bottom corner is often firm to the point of being mistaken for Ice. It shouldn‚Äôt deter you from skiing it. Just know that‚Äôs a very last turn requires more outside ski pressure.

For a front side groomer off ram charger, most of us prefer Tippy‚Äôs tumble . It is one of Big Sky‚Äòs best blue runs.

At the top of ram charger off of tippy‚Äòs, you can also pick up elk Park. Elk Park is a great giant slalom style blue run they will take you to the thunder Wolf lift which brings you to the top of ram charger again.",t2_16a9e,spacebass,0,1647068366.0,0,t1_i0cdbty,i0cdbty,True,electriclove9,t3_tc88y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/tc88y9/easy_blue_down_from_top_of_ramcharger/,Easy blue down from top of Ramcharger?,/r/bigsky/comments/tc88y9/easy_blue_down_from_top_of_ramcharger/i0cdbty/,6,r/bigsky,0,6

"Lone Mointain Ranch has been there providing services to visitors, since 1915. They took care of guests heading to and from Yellowstone wayyy before the town of Big Sky and its makebelieve ski area were established. 

It's a good way to get an experience similar to the old days. Way cooler than riding a snowcat to a yurt at Big Sky. And the live music is awesome.

LMR is staffed by good ol' cowboy kids who love horses, even during fridgid nights in the dead of winter. They have hours of work ahead of them after the fancy sleigh ride is over.

"It‚Äôs a very nice event and they pull ironed really well.  You spend about 30-40 mins traveling by sleigh to a small cabin in the woods.  Inside are several ta blew where you eat family style.  The food is very good. During dinner you have a musician playing some good old country music.  Overall it‚Äôs a very nice way to spend an evening.

To answer your question about was it worth it?  Well, that‚Äôs very subjective.  It is a lot of money.  We did it last in early January and I thought it was around $185/person.  It has gone up a lot over the years.  We used to do it every year we came skiing but now, it was the first time in 3 years.  They seem a bit more rushed as they have 2 dinner trips instead of one.  They say it‚Äôs because of Covid but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs a lucrative event.

"Forget about any decent hot springs around the Big Sky area.  You have to drive too far to get to anything real.  If I had three down days, I‚Äôd plan a trip to West Yellowstone and rent snow machines.  They have hundreds of trails down there at are well marked and you‚Äôll have a blast.  The second day you can join a group tour into Yellowstone for the day.  Nothing like seeing geysers in winter - plus all the animals.  The drive to West Yellowstone is about an hour from Big Sky and it‚Äôs beautiful.  The third day, see the Grizzly and Wolf discovery center that is open in winter and we‚Äôll worth another trip to West Yellowstone.  On your way back to Big Sky, take the turn off to Earthquake Lake, continue to Ennis to see a nice western town, then drive toward Bozeman (awesome drive) and visit a local restaurant before driving back south to Big Sky.

"Safari is always a bit of a struggle. Part of safari is really just a groomed path through Africa, a bumpy blue run. And usually by 11am the groomed path has been pretty cut up. It won‚Äôt be bumpy but because there are bumps to the left and right a below a lot of people look at it and get nervous. So it‚Äôs as much of a mental game as a skiing challenge. 

Downloading Ram Charger is kinda fun and is an option more people should take. I do it a lot with groups of skiers at your levels who want to access the amazing stuff off Southern Comfort but don‚Äôt feel comfortable on safari. That said, I‚Äôve coached 100s of people down safari successfully - once you make a turn and realize you can ski it, it feels a lot better! 

You ski the little groomed path through Africa and then swing back right and re-join the flattish green cat track style lower part of safari and you‚Äôre home free. 

Pacifier is also an option. It‚Äôs quite easy to ski. But! It is narrow and drops into the woods on the left. No one ever goes flying off into the woods but people get very intimidated that they will. And when other more advanced skiers come flying by it adds to the intimidation. So skiing wise, pacifier is all but flat.  But mentally it gets to a lot of people.

I know exactly what your saying. One thing I hadn‚Äôt realized before skiing out west (big sky was my first time out there) is that rocks are strewn across every inch of the ground in small fragments. In the east out rocks are weathered down and mostly buried beneath soil and grass and have a few edges that poke out. That allows us to ski with relatively very little snow,t2_zsev0vb,skittlesriddles44,0,1645344055.0,0,t1_hxoixdj,hxoixdj,False,skittlesriddles44,t3_su17rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/su17rw/i_know_the_snow_has_been_bad_this_season_how/,"I know the snow has been bad this season, how different from this is a good season?",/r/bigsky/comments/su17rw/i_know_the_snow_has_been_bad_this_season_how/hxoixdj/,1,r/bigsky,0,1

"We just got new snow, about 12"" in this past storm cycle. From what I've heard conditions were good yesterday and the wind moved snow around so that the snow was great in some areas but firm in others. On the whole, it hasn't been a great snow year but this time of year is usually when conditions start to improve. We have another storm in the forecast before things cool off next week so the snow could end up being decent for your trip but I would expect to find variable conditions, some spots firm, others with new snow or wind loaded pockets.

Looks like temperature predictions are anywhere from a high of -2 degrees up to 10 degrees at the beginning of the week and then it should warm up. Still will be cold though which could help keep the coverage but not as much fun to be out on the mountain in the single digits.

Your call but it will be on the cold side with some variable snow conditions, still probably better than most of the winter so far.

"Our family just finished up a week at Big Sky.  I have skied for 36-years, and spent a lot of time in the mountains (we live in Minnesota, so no mountains here).  It was my wife/kids first time in the mountains.

*TL;DR- We had a wonderful time.*

My wife stuck mostly to greens and easy blues, and had very few issues with rocks.  Nearly all of the groomed runs were in fantastic condition (the only caveats to that were a few patchy areas on Cow Flats on our way down to Shedhorn lift, and at least when we skied it, there were some bad spots on Horseshoe).  The boys and I skied a lot in the bowl which was in great condition, and my older son and I did the tram quite a bit (also in good shape), and runs off Challenger which was a bit hit-and-miss- we found we had to be quite careful, and especially after Thursday's warm temps, it was icy/hard on Friday, and lots of rocks to watch out for.

All of the beginner terrain is in great shape.  My wife really enjoyed skiing everything off the Southern Comfort lift, Mr. K and Lobo off Swift Current, and Upper Morningstar off Powder Seeker.

While there are some areas of the mountain that aren't in great shape, there is a ton of great terrain for all ability levels.  Explore the mountain, find spots that y'all enjoy, and you'll have a fantastic trip.  Also- read the latest couple unofficial snow and operations reports, as they are gold for finding great areas to ski!",t2_9cgmn,Crohwned,0,1644781655.0,0,t1_hwtefq8,hwtefq8,False,hebsbbejakbdjw,t3_spi36w,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/spi36w/best_tree_skiing/,Best tree skiing?,/r/bigsky/comments/spi36w/best_tree_skiing/hwtefq8/,3,r/bigsky,0,3
"Just finished up a week at Big Sky.  u/spacebass \- thank you so much for these reports!  Especially in a low snow season like y'all are having, they are extremely valuable in finding the best areas to ski.

On Friday I was able to make 7 laps on the Tram.  The bottom half of Liberty was pretty miserable- icy/hard to keep an edge (and I wouldn't recommend it for people new to steep terrain).  Lenin and Marx however were skiing great.  The snow didn't look great from the top, but it was that nice chalky stuff that held an edge quite well.  My new-to-steep-terrain 12-year-old who went up with me commented that Lenin and Marx were much easier and more enjoyable for him than the bottom half of Liberty, FWIW.

For those with kiddos that are a bit adventurous- I'd second the recommendation for the bowl.  It was my 8-year-old and 12-year-old's playground for much of the trip.  I'd recommend watching out for a few rocks right near the entrance of the Powder Seeker 6 lift line, as we got clipped a few times.  Another fun one for the kids was Forbidden Forest.  While Mrs. Crohwned would ski down Mr. K, the kids would take the BRT Road traverse, drop in through Forbidden, cut across Lower Morningstar to Lois Lane, and pop out on Mr. K to meet up again.   

One thing I would note about Shedhorn grill- the ""easy"" route down to it (Top of Shedhorn lift down Upper Sunlight) is skiing much more like a black than a blue at the moment.  My beginner-intermediate wife had quite a difficult (and harrowing) time getting down the bowl.  Though after *surviving* (as she put it), she said it was ""the best burger she'd ever had!"" It may have been the adrenaline talking? (I mean the burgers were quite good... but not sure if they were the best I'd ever had ;) ).

Thanks again u/spacebass for these great reports.  They really helped our new-to-Big-Sky family have a fantastic trip, even with the less-than-optimal snow coverage.

"This is a little complicated. You will see a lot of posts here and elsewhere lamenting the crowds. It is true that we have near record visitors. What is also true is that Big Sky has a considerable amount of skiable acreage, as you know.

If you look at the base area, both ram charger and Swift current appear to have big lines.

It is important to note the both of those lifts move a considerable number of people up the mountain at a considerably faster pace than most lifts. Even when swift current is backed up all the way to the end of the line, it is not more than a nine minute wait.

I think we all miss the heyday of our favorite ski hills. And there‚Äôs lots of conflicted feelings about the Ikon pass.

The reality is, Big Sky is a world-class ski mountain and it‚Äôs on the map for a lot of families and visitors. To me, right now, the most challenging aspect Big sky is its limited number of base village options for dining.

The thing to celebrate is how well mountain ops are doing to try and maintain an equally world-class guest experience.

"it is worth noting that the mountain really is suffering right now. sadly it is true. The trees are your best bet, but there are two concerns: 
1.	Big Sky has a lot of deadfall and if you don't know the line, make sure to take it slowly the first time
2.	There are rocks in a lot of the downhill slides of bumps. Watch out.

"I'm biased but I suggest you hire an instructor for a day :)   


I like a lot of the suggestions on this thread. Here's some info on conditions from a week ago which also includes some suggestions / info on slopes and lifts:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/s92u37/big\_sky\_unofficial\_snow\_and\_operations\_report\_for/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/s92u37/big_sky_unofficial_snow_and_operations_report_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  


I like to suggest people divide the mountain into sixths. You could ski a sixth a day and not get bored.   


1. Andesite - up the Ram Charger Lift. From there you have access to nice, steep, blue groomers like Elk Park, Tippy's, and Silver Knife. You can ski off the back side to the Southern Comfort lift which will give you access to some nice glades like Pomp and Lizette. On the East side, you can get into some insane steep trees like Bolivia, Peru, and Shady Chutes. On the way home you can hit Congo, Africa, and Nile for blue tree bumps. 
2. Shedhorn - the south side. It is improving as snowfalls improve. Shedhorn has some nice trees, some good blues. You can have lunch at Shedhorn Grill. To get there, you can ski Pork Rind off Swift Current for some nice black off piste stuff. 
3. Swift Current + Powder Seeker - the 6 seater lift out of the base area and the 6 seater that serves the Bowl. Off SC6, explore Soul Hole, Rice Bowl, Buffalo Jump and Tango. Go up to the Bowl early for the best light. Ski the gut of the bowl and then continue to work around the traverse. South Wall skis great! Take Harbor's Half Pipe home for some easy but true fun :) 
4. North Side - from SC6, take Jay Walk to the Iron Horse lift. From there, ski under the Six Shooter lift for a few nice blues. Then get up Lone Tree for things like Shaftway, Broken Hearted, and even Lone Tree itself. If you are feeling double blacks, ski Obsidian and maybe lower DTM. 
5. Tram and Headwaters - the most advanced stuff. The Tram is an added fee. The only single black is Liberty Bowl. Marx and Lenin are skiing well as double blacks. The Big and North Summit requite an avalanche beacon, a partner, and signing out with ski patrol at the top. Triple blacks are, generally, high consequence no-fall zones.  Headwaters is accessible from the top of Challenger or the Headwaters lift. Most of the runs require a hike which isn't for the faint of heart. And if you've never put on skis on a 45-50 degree slope, it isn't the best place to learn to do it. Alder gulch is lift-accessible and is a good place to experience some steeps. 
6. Challenger - the challenger lift services some great blacks and double blacks. Pay attention to signs, you can get cliffed out in some areas, but it is generally approachable for advanced skiers. 

Note that at Big Sky, many groomer blues are what would be groomed blacks elsewhere. If it is black at Big Sky, it doesn't get groomed so all blacks are bump runs.",t2_16a9e,spacebass,0,1643941191.0,0,t1_hvia31r,hvia31r,True,RusselGlad,t3_sjnaoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/sjnaoq/big_sky_resort_skiing/,Big Sky Resort Skiing,/r/bigsky/comments/sjnaoq/big_sky_resort_skiing/hvia31r/,3,r/bigsky,0,3
"Don‚Äôt spend time or money on tram if you‚Äôre a midwesterner who‚Äôs never been out west. Plenty of great terrain without paying $30/day or $50/day extra. I‚Äôve been snowboarding 15 years. Been to about 15 mountains out west.

1.Ramcharger to warm up. Lots of blues. You‚Äôre gonna see that a blue at Big Sky is a Midwestern double black. I live in midwest and my 4 year old after 4 days at Big Sky ski school, having never skied before, ended doing S turns on a green at Big Sky. This was comparable to midwestern blue-black at home.

2.Swifty to powder seeker for the bowl (black) once you get your legs.

"I'm in a similar position, but I wouldn't say I'm an expert snowboarder. I'm from the midwest, and while I'm an expert around here, I don't know what that translates to for mountain snowboarding. Sorry to piggyback off your question, but I expect we might get similar answers from someone who knows.

So similar question, it's my first trip out to Big Sky (or any mountain resort) and would like to know a recommendation for what lifts/runs to start on. I'm going for three days and plan to take the tram one of those days. I'm assuming I should get used to the altitude and mountain in general on the first day while trying not to get too sore, then maybe doing the tram day two. Even with the tram, I hope to try the easiest of those runs first (I hear there are single blacks up there, and not just double/triple). 

As for the normal runs/groomers, I love the idea of finding runs with less people on them. I like to go fast and do big carves from one side to the other, so if I can do that on a side run without the worry of a lot of people coming up behind me and getting in their way, that would be so cool. Also, if there happen to be any runs that are good for training before I take the tram, that would be good to do day one.",t2_ft8r5,heatfan10,0,1643906053.0,0,t1_hvfs38j,hvfs38j,True,RusselGlad,t3_sjnaoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/sjnaoq/big_sky_resort_skiing/,Big Sky Resort Skiing,/r/bigsky/comments/sjnaoq/big_sky_resort_skiing/hvfs38j/,2,r/bigsky,0,2

There's two mountains at Big Sky.. both have the type of runs you are asking about.  Ramcharger lift serves access to the Andesite side.  Swifty takes you up the other, the Lone Peak side.

off Ramcharger to the rhs are several very nice long runs, Deep South, Sacajawea.  Served by the Southern Comfort lift to come back up.

Off Swifty many similar runs Mr. K and Lower Morning Star.

imo, Start, on the Ramcharger side.

"Below is a post I've recycled from last year that addresses 2 & 3. For 4, there is an Albertsons in Belgrade that's right on the way to Big Sky from BZN, if you are flying. It will have everything but liquor, and there is a liquor store right around the corner. For 5, we usually eat in, so I don't know a lot...but if you want a change from the Base Area and don't mind the drive, consider Corral Bar off 191 just south of the Big Sky junction. It's a Cowboy Bar with great chicken-fried steak. 

When we were there in late Feb. last year, lift lines were noticeable even during this week. Six Shooter was particularly bottlenecked. If you have time, post what you see next week. We're coming on the 6th (and hoping for snow in the meant time)

Here is my post from last year. Should work for this year, except for caveats about thin coverage that others have offered:

\*\*\*

My main piece of advice is to ski for 4 or all 5 of the days you're there, if possible. It's so big--three days won't even scratch the surface :)  
You've gotten a lot of good recommendations. I'll chip in as a fellow east-coaster: If you are comfy on NE doubles, especially in ""firm"" conditions, then you'll have lot of great terrain at your disposal. I do agree with previous posts that the ratings are a bit sandbagged, even compared to Alta & Snowbird, so you're wise to ease your way in.  
You might consider spending the first morning warming up on Andesite, which is kind of like Brighton. You'll get a good view of Andesite on the drive up, especially the Elk Park area. It looks so cool, and it's the SMALLEST AREA!! If you're not stoked then you better pull over and get your buddies to start CPR.  
Start there with some fun blues like Elk Park, Fremont's, and Madagascar, then try a couple of short blacks like Mad Wolf & Wolverine. If you feel good on those, then move to longer blacks like Blue Room & Coulter's Hell.  
After lunch, take Powder Seeker to the Bowl, and do a few laps progressing from skier's left to right. If you feel solid on the right side (and I mean solid), then you're probably OK for Liberty Bowl and Challenger. I agree that even the easiest runs of Challenger are more technical than LB, but LB is long and intimidatingly exposed, with a sometimes-sketchy traverse and rocky upper section. You should ask about the conditions before you go up. Considering your short visit and the long waits at the Tram that others have mentioned, I'd recommend it only if you get a bluebird day, so that you can enjoy the massive view from the top. Otherwise, there's so much good terrain elsewhere without wasting 60 to 90 minutes standing still.  
Other than that, I agree with pretty much all the runs that others have recommended, and would add Tango Trees, White Magic, Whisky, and Lone Wolf Gully as ""warmup"" runs that are a blast in their own right. Pretty much everything else that I (and others) recommend is well-travelled--I'm not giving away info on anyone's stash. For sure, the terrain off Shedhorn and Dakota is fantastic but make sure that you and your crew stay in your comfort zones and keep eyes on each other at all times. My group and I had to pull a guy out of a tree well last year after he'd strayed from his crew (or vice-versa; anyway, we should have made all of them buy all of us beer for the rest of the trip) Don't be those guys.

"Cant really answer all your questions but i‚Äôll give it a shot,

1. Pretty good coverage throughout the big sky area except on moonlight side near madison base area but there is free wi-fi 

2. Elk Park Ridge (Blue), The Bowl (Black), Any Black runs off Lookout ridge, Runs off the south face might be good but i‚Äôm not sure about coverage over there right now since snowpack is relatively thin

You most likely will hit rocks on most terrain that isn‚Äôt a groomer with the low snowfall but if you are being observant you‚Äôll be able to avoid most

3. Thunderwolf (blues and blacks), Lone Tree (Mostly blacks), Ramcharger (Mostly same terrain as thunderwolf but services more blues), Dakota and Shedhorn if southface has good coverage. Swift Current is good too for groomers but not too many runs that really standout from there

I wouldn‚Äôt spend most of your time on a single lift but if you are here for 4 days or more I‚Äôd recommend spending each day exploring each zone of the mountain since it‚Äôs impossible to see the entirety of what each lift has to offer in 1 or 2 days.

4. Do all of your grocery shopping in bozeman since all the prices within big sky are much higher (i think there‚Äôs only 1 actual grocery store in big sky). Also fill your gas tank to full in bozeman/four corners, gas is very expensive in big sky compared the to bozeman

5. Not much input on this one since i don‚Äôt eat out much here so a google search will probably help find good food options

"Quick Update for Friday 1/21/2022

The mountain is skiing really well! 

The north side has filled in and many of the bare spots are now covered. 

Six Shooter

* Meriweather - great long blue cruiser, just watch for people 
* Cinnabar - still our best long green for the newest skiers. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not accessible for new skiers from the mountain village side, but if you are looking for learning terrain on the Madison side, check it out
* Jaws - great blue tree glade 

Challenger - skiing is amazing right now! Watch for rocks on the entry. 

Lone Tree - steeps, deeps, face shots if you know where to go. My suggestion is the trees on skiers right of the lift line. 

Back on the mountain village side‚Ä¶

Swifty

* Tango - like I said, always amazing
* Buff Jump - softer and good for some steeps practice 

SoCo 

Get in the woods! 

El Dorado is also nicely filled in and is a good aggressive green for skiers looking for a challenge before their first blue. 

‚Äî-
Operations

Mostly fine. 

Canyon - 60% dry. Use caution and use the pull outs for more aggressive traffic,

"All good advice above.  If you rent and think you have room, stop in The Albertsons grocery store in Belgrade and get groceries.

In order to be sure you have a 4wheel drive consider renting from Explore Rentals, https://explore-rentals.com/.  All their vehicles have snow tire and 4wd...which the others, to my knowledge, will not guarantee.

Grocery stores at BigSky are Hungry Moose, Roxys and The Country Market.  Hungry Moose does curbside pickup.  *If you are staying up on the mountain at the base there is a 2nd Hungry Moose, although smaller it has a good subset of essential items.

Lastly..make restaurant reservations in advance.  Everetts on the mountain has spectacular views, but you most likely will not get in without a reservation.  Same goes for The Cabin, Lotus Pad, Olives Bs...my favorites.

"This is a resort town, we know why people are visiting and what they like to do. Most of our stores are stocked to the brim with local and craft beers, as well as national favorites in 12 and 18 packs. If you're looking for good wine,  go to the hungry moose. They have a surprisingly advanced selection of high-end and delicious varietals. But if you're not a level 2 sommelier,  there's still bottles in there in the 20 to $40 range That will please your palette. 

Roxy's probably has more larger cases for beer, but their prices are atrocious so keep that in mind. They do a 4x markup.

Country market has the smallest selection for beer and wine. I would probably go here for food and not booze.

We have the cave, which is our local liquor store. A Bit pricey. I prefer to shop at Montana wines and spirits in Bozeman personally.

If you're shopping in Bozeman, check out the bottle shop at Shine brewery.  They have an amazing selection of craft and local beers, and you can build your own six packs there.",t2_1jae00fg,SeaOfBullshit,0,1642279214.0,0,t1_hst7lmc,hst7lmc,True,nastutts0309,t3_s4tdwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/s4tdwl/sourcing_beerwine/,Sourcing Beer/wine,/r/bigsky/comments/s4tdwl/sourcing_beerwine/hst7lmc/,5,r/bigsky,0,5

"Under similar road conditions, I'd say it's a much easier drive than Snowbird. The elevation change is pretty minor and most of the turns are also gradual (with maybe 2 hard turns near the resort itself). In contrast, the Snowbird drive up Little Cottonwood combines a decent elevation change with turns at the same time.

However, the two challenges with the Big Sky drive are 1.) The sun hits the road at weird angles in the Gallatin Canyon, and 2.) There are at least 2 small overpasses over the Gallatin River. These are two details that lead to ice patches on the road, and it's why you'll want to have snow tires on your car if possible.

"The drive down 191 from the airport starts out in the valley of Bozeman with views of mountains in virtually all directions.  As you head south past to Gallatin Gateway, you will suddenly enter the mountains as you drive along the Gallatin river to Big Sky.  The views are amazing around most every turn.  Some areas have steep cliffs with castle like structures on top.  

You will be driving about 25-30 mins along the river till you make the turn to Big Sky at 64.  A mile or so up the road and suddenly Lone Peak appears.  You can‚Äôt miss it and it‚Äôs stunning - especially if is a bluebird day.  The white peak with the blue sky behind is awesome!  The ride will continue for another 15 mins as you will see the mountain most of the way up to the resort - making you more and more excited to get on the slopes!

I think it‚Äôs one of my favorite things about Big Sky - the actual drive to the resort.  I hope you will enjoy it too.  Make sure you have a window seat that also can see out the front.

"I think you're going to have a great trip. Our coverage is good and the mountain is skiing well! 

If you see Lone Mountain (Big Sky) in the summer, you'll see that it looks very different from, say, Vail. Our mountain isn't covered in soft grass and greens. It is a giant pile of small shale rocks. It is a massive sand castle. As a result, we have more exposed rocks on roll overs, wind chaffed areas, and drop ins than most places. And, Big Sky doesn't mow down pucker shrubs every summer. And as a result of that, Big Sky gets a reputation for being Big Rocky. But the truth is, it's just a world-class ski hill with its own character. 

We got a lot of snow this week and the trails and tress are all covered. It looks and feels like deep winter and ski season. 

If you're experienced and advanced riders, I suggest checking out: 

* Elk Park Meadow for pow and glades 
* Shady Chute for steep deep trees 
* the south wall of the Bowl 
* Moonlight off Challenger for bumps and trees
* Broken Hearted -> Ice House on the north side.

"Hi Big Ski skiers and guests! 

I hope you locals and visitors have enjoyed this winter weather. The snow has done wonders for the mountain, but more over, it has made the skiing fantastic. 

Just about everything open is skiing really well right now. And, if you know where to look, the pow stashes are still deep and plentiful. 

The snow has come with some warmer temps ‚Äîwe're talking high 20s ‚Äîwhich is quite welcome for Montana in January. And the post-holiday vibe is chill, relaxed, and not too crowded. 

**Conditions**

For our newer skiers and those who enjoy greens, things continue to ski really nicely. The iconic Mr. K and Lower Morning Star continue to be fun. And the sport Harbors Half Pipe and Lois Lane are excellent for skiers of every level. 

On the SoCo side, just about everything is fantastic. Deep South and Sacajawea continue to be great for skiers of all levels. For those who prefer a groomed run over our lose new snow, be sure to check the grooming reports. 

In the trees, Lizette and Pomp are favorites for intermediate skiers, kids, families, and users named /u/SpaceBass. Get in there and enjoy the soft snow and fun glades! 

For intermediate skiers, the mountain is yours right now! There's not a bad turn to be found, from Ponderosa, Silver Knife, and Elk Park to the runs on the north side like Horseshoe Bowl, Meryweather, and Powder River. Everything is great! 

For advanced skiers, the winds and visibility have made the bowl unpleasant. That's brought many of us down into the trees. Tango, Soul Hole, Rice Bowl, Buff Jump, Snake Bite... all great! Stump Farm is home to some remaining pow stashes. 

For our most advanced guests, Challenger is...well right now it's just an expression of joy! The entry is good, but predictably rocky, the rest is just bliss! Please be careful up there, I saw some people in over their heads over the last two days. As tempting as it may be, please remember Challenger serves some really hard terrain. 

I haven't been in headwaters this week to offer a report. 

Shedhorn still needs time, not worth it unless you're craving a burger over there. 

Moonlight residential runs are covered. 

Spanish Peaks residential access if fine but not worth a trip for non-residents. 

Places of note: 

* Africa bumps - go rip a zipper in the soft pow bumps! 
* Elk Park Meadows - still deep! I was knee deep and it was not tracked out. 
* Lone Tree and the entire ridge down to Six Shooter - accessible higher end blues, blacks, and some amazing double blacks for the more skilled skiers. 

**Operations**

Please be kind. Everyone is working hard to keep Big Sky safe, open, and a positive experience. Many workers have been working nonstop since before the holidays. Everyone seems in good spirits, but remember to thank a lifty, give patrol a nod, and take a lesson if you want to improve your skiing or learn the hill. 

**Canyon**

The warmer temps have done wonders. The canyon is 80% clear and mostly dry on the Bozeman side. Be careful. Remember, if there are more than 3 cars behind you, Montana law requires you to use the turn outs and let them pass. 

**Suggestions**
Eat outside! Stay hydrated. The warmer temps and great skiing make it easy to forget to drink water. When in doubt, get some h20!",t2_16a9e,spacebass,0,1641608150.0,0,t1_hrq3qiw,hrq3qiw,True,AutoModerator,t3_rxgjrk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bigsky/comments/rxgjrk/unofficial_big_sky_snow_and_operations_report/,"Unofficial Big Sky snow and operations report thread for the weekend of January 06, 2022",/r/bigsky/comments/rxgjrk/unofficial_big_sky_snow_and_operations_report/hrq3qiw/,6,r/bigsky,0,6

"Take this or leave it, I'm mentioning it with very good intentions. Be aware that substance abuse is a thing in big sky, so be prepared for that. Sobriety is a beautiful accomplishment, but not an easy one - good for you for taking the steps to better yourself. With that out of the way, big sky has a great community of riders and some super talented rippers at that. I'm mostly a weekend warrior with a little one so my planning options are tricky, otherwise I'd offer to shred. I can tell you that getting out there and socializing on lifts, restaurants, etc is a great way to meet riding buddies. The Backcountry is big - long tours to get to lines, but it's beautiful and that's half the point. The snow pack is pretty challenging around here too, so make sure you're prepared and going solo isn't recommended.

"Beehive Brewery is awesome, but for cheap beers and great atmosphere, Riverhouse is also the place to go.  $5 montana drafts can't be beat.  Also, I don't want to sell Bozeman and Main St. short because there are some great restaurants down there.  Blackbird is great, I love Bridger Brewing, Sidewinders, Montana Ale Works, etc.  But in the winter, driving the Canyon is iffy so it is good to avoid it except on your way in to Big Sky or way out of town.
