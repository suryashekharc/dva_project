I highly recommend Dental Health Associates. They are aware if your a bit anxious when it comes to dental care. They corrected the work that another local dental office did which my insurance wouldn’t cover because it was basically rework from less than a year prior and they worked with me on my out of pocket costs. From my experience some dentist seem to say you need more work done than you actually do and this dental office is the first to say “everything’s good see you 6 month” after a standard checkup/cleaning.

Yes they agreed by taking the job. I’m sure their contract didn’t say you have pandemics off. Being that it’s a hospital I am pretty sure that would be pretty obvious. I believe they should be compensated more but they did agree to what they are being paid.

"Instead of just calling the foundational author of a philosophy which you claim to adhere to a 'dickhead', how about you provide an actual critique of his thoughts. 

What you seem to be describing is a state of nature, which is definitely not the same thing as an anarchy. In our world today, the state has the monopoly on violence, you're just waiting for the Boogaloo so that you and your gun buddies can have the monopoly on violence. It doesn't take much thinking to realize that latter is just as bad as the former. 

Great, so me and my fellow workers control our monetary choices by owning the full production of our labor by seizing Jeffy Bezos' rocket factory. An oligarchy of private capital is no less exploitative than a state oligarchy. Ending private ownership of the means of production is not the same as ending all markets if that's what you think.

"Look my guy I’m not playing. I didn’t intentionally insult you as you did me.  

I really hope your remodel goes well. I’ve been frustrated on behalf of people I know with their remodels.

"Look, you roll into the comments section making statements without even \*remotely\* asking a single question to ascertain whether your anecdotal ""help"" has any bearing what-so-ever. So, yeah, you are going to get a profoundly stand-offish reply.

Selling a home that was purchased nearly ten years ago at the bottom of the market, and refi-ed for historically low interest rates would be about as idiotic as expecting a remodel project to come in under budget or on schedule.

We aren't doing some frivolous remodel to make our home more instagramable. We aren't trying to slap some barn-doors on a bedroom or some tacky-ass shit. We are trying to have considerable issues remedied for the years we have left in this house, let alone for future owners.

I can't speak to what your friends were trying to do, or what they expected, frankly, I don't really care. I'm comfortable assuming their experiences and projects don't relate to our expectations or goals.

Unfortunately, whether your attempt was genuine or not, it came across as presumptive and assholeish. It was hard to tell you sincerely hope anything positive because your words were exactly the opposite until I got confrontational about your shitposting when I was looking for help.

If you'd like to look at my responses to the other comments here; you will see they provided useful information, and I happily responded in the positive.
The reality is that in our situation, which you attempted to ascertain absolutely no information about, your advice of ""not worth it, sell the place"" is pure idiocy.

"Puyallup has 2 ""neighborhoods"". Downtown and South Hill. I live in downtown. Downtown has old homes, some new, community events, the library, the farmers market, the fair, the new light rail garage and is more walkable. 

South Hill is up the hill and starts around the mall. This is where traffic really gets bad on meridian and the traffic cameras begin.

"But isn't it the parent who's responsible for not feeding their child fear porn? You don't have to scare kids into submission.

There are legitimate/serious mental health impacts, but we consider dropping the masks because we see how things currently are and say ok, not so bad, we can just live with this--when the next variant could be so much worse. That isn't to fear what's to come, it's about forecasting risk and being proactive. Our infrastructure isn't sufficient to put this thing to rest yet.  

If it were up to me, there'd be daily testing in schools and N95 masks would be required indoors at all times, but there would be more frequent breaks to an outside area where masks are optional/kids can take their masks off for a bit. Kids would be encouraged to social distance, but there wouldn't be any enforcement if kids want to be close to each other. That'd let kids be kids while also greatly decreasing risk.

Everyone has access to vaccines. With the omicron spike, nearly everyone has natural immunity. Everyone can wear a n95 mask which are highly effective during one way masking scenarios. If you want to mask your kid, go for it. Don't force me to mask mine.

"I live in Bonney Lake, in the northeastern part just south of Lake Tapps. It definitely feels like a city that sort of just *happened* instead of being planned out.

Pros:

- Lots of stores and restaurants. Pretty much everything you can think except there's no dedicated sporting goods store.

- Natural beauty! You can get a great view of Mt. Rainier from most parts of the city. Plus great views of Orting and Sumner from up high. Lots of trees.

- Safety from natural disasters. Most of the city isn't in a flood zone and none of it is in a lahar zone. We chose Bonney Lake mostly because of this.

- My kids are in the White River School District. It's far away but we love it. Sumner-Bonney Lake District has some good reviews as far as we know.

Cons:

- Road layout is terrible. ""Downtown"" is stretched out along the 410 and every other road is one lane.

- City is on a plateau so driving out sucks in freezing weather

- There's no way to walk long distances in the city unless you're already on the 410. Forget biking around town.

- Serious lack of parks. The only sizable one, behind the shopping center with Fred Meyer, is supremely sketchy

- Wildfire danger. There was a big one in the west part of town two years ago and a minor one in the south last summer.


Other than that, population is mostly conservative. Lots of air traffic with flights coming into Seattle all seem to pass over Lake Tapps, but also hot air balloons are pretty common in the summer, which is nice.

"I am really surprised no one has mentioned how bad the winters are..

Going from a winter in Florida to a winter in Seattle is a heck of a change. I have been here for 4 winters now, and they just keep getting worse. 

The sun basically goes away in October and doesn't return until June. 

It gets dark early here- there are 2 fewer hours of daylight during winter solstice than you would get in Florida. And there isn't really a dusk.

Nighttime just kinda happens. You go from gray to black. Basically 8 months without a hint of orange or red in the sky from the sunset. Just Gray to Black. 

The Gray hides the mountains for basically 8 months. The views are spectacular in the summer, but they quickly turn into gray purgatory in the winter. Basically all winter. 

Everything is wet and muddy all the time. You can't let the dog out without wiping his paws before coming in, you cant wear certain kinds of shoes because your socks will immediately get wet, your deck is going to rot faster, you are going to get moss growing on every surface on your property.. everything is wet all the time.

You want to rake those leaves in your yard? well have fun raking wet leaves. 

You like taking evening walks around the block? Hope you like taking walks in cold rain. 

You like grilling in the backyard while having a beer? Well it's raining and you stored your grill in the shed because otherwise it will be rusted and water damaged next spring. 

Basically any outdoor winter activity you would do in the summer is put on hold or waaaay worse during the winter.

"Also from Florida (Tampa, wife is FL born, and I lived there for 15 years from the UK), I'm also WFH full-time. We've been here \~5 years and our reason for moving was pretty similar: the heat is just relentless.

The first summer we moved here and I put my hand on the roof of my car and whipped it away so as not to get burned… and then realized I didn't have to, was revelatory 🤣

All in all, the area as a whole is beautiful, when the mountain is out it's glorious, and the roads can be super fun to drive when traffic isn't too bad (how *boring* is Florida driving? No such thing as a straight flat road here!).

Also, while the rain can seem constant, we get fewer inches per year than Tampa, and you'll very rarely get a good thunderstorm (booooo!), but the summers are the best I've ever known. Plus, it snows usually once a year, sometimes none, sometimes a few times. As a person that works from home, it won't cause you any issues so long as you get some staples before it happens as everything virtually shuts down for a day or three as most people don't drive in the snow.

I do recommend central heat and air if you can, summers can reach mid-to-high 90s (and we've seen over 110F) which is terrible enough but then you add the wildfire smoke which means you need to keep the windows closed and it's just unbearable. We did fine with some portable units in our rental, but it was #1 on our must-haves for buying. A (gas for us) fireplace is really nice in the winter 😍

For Puyallup especially, we live NW of the Fairgrounds, we've not noticed any major traffic due to events there, except the streets directly around it, and we have found dining in/around Puyallup to be OK — there's some local joints, some Seattle-area/WA/PNW native stuff, and most of the big chains. I definitely recommend checking out Google Maps, as well as something like DoorDash to see what's available for delivery if that's your jam.

My neighbors are lovely, and our neighborhood seems quite nice (we've been in this house \~6 months, moving from Kent/Covington area), lots of folks put out great Halloween and Christmas decorations, there's a bunch of Little Libraries around, that kind of stuff. Schools are solid too, they've been fantastic with my kid and their special needs.

The only complaint I have is the train track which runs like… 3 houses down from ours and literally shakes the house at all hours of the day and night, often with train whistles blowing. It's not so bad with all the windows closed though!

We have some other friends who moved up from Tampa a few years after us, and they love it out here too, FWIW.

"As a rule, the areas immediately adjacent to Canyon and Meridian on South Hill can be kinda sketchy, but the rest of the area in between, as well as east of Meridian, is generally very safe. Downtown is also pretty safe in my experience, but I only go down there occasionally for the restaurants, bars, and coffee, so take that with a grain of salt. 

Graham is a bit further down south too and is probably the safest area you could possibly ask for, but it can be a bit of a commute if you're driving anywhere outside of the Puyallup/Graham area. It's also a lot more rural which might not be super appealing to some people.

Overall as long as you aren't right next to Canyon or Meridian, the rest of the area is generally quite safe.

"Crime isn't an issue really anywhere, but that south hill traffic is soooo bad. 

If you aren't familiar with the area, south hill is generally the area around meridian from south hill mall south to graham. Meridian is the main street running there and it is much too small for the population it serves. It is basically a giant strip mall the entire length with a stoplight every block. There are ""back routes"" but driving on meridian when you live there is inevitable. 

I would prefer ""downtown"" or ""in the valley"" which is generally north of south hill mall to the river. I would personally stay west of the fairgrounds as you get fair traffic/ parking at times, you run into a bit of homelessness around the river and in the heart of downtown, but they tend to keep to themselves.

"OP, good luck- Just wanted to let you know that you are potentially introducing demand characteristic bias into your survey by stating your intentions with the survey ""an effort to find the missed opportunities for change in the Washington education system"". It isn't the most egregious, but still may affect your results in a couple of ways- respondents my intentionally or unintentionally change their responses to to tell you what you are wanting to hear/ are hoping to find, or you may get more participation from teachers who are eager for change than from teachers that are more content on how the system is currently being run. 

Also hope you are promoting this survey elsewhere, as you may have non-response bias if you are only posting to reddit (or only on social media).

"I've also had a package stolen on video. Clear view of the person and the vehicle with license plate. The USPS could not care less in spite of how people like to parrot how vicious their investigators are and it's a federal crime to steal mail. SS911 will give you a case number (I think the auto-generated number turned out not to be the real case number). The sheriff's department did send someone by to grab my video but understandably was told not to expect anything to happen. I ended up tracking the loser down (convicted felon) and saw that he had a suspicious amount of commonly stolen items on OfferUp so I updated my case with that info and eventually was contacted by a detective. He said my particular theft was not worth pursuing but he was interested in the OfferUp info and would be taking a closer look. So....even after you do your own detective work there's really not much that's going to happen. Hopefully your seller can claim some sort of insurance through USPS.

"So sad to see you guys so beat down. Going to good Sam when I was a kid and everything seeming so big and grand was one of the reasons I got into medicine at all (I know that’s sounds cheesy). I moved away from puyallup a few years ago now. I’m over here in Arizona now and let me tell you, as an EMT i feel burnt and that’s saying something considering I’m not even actually working in the ED. It has been months but we are still at the point we’re our supply chain can’t get our trucks enough oxygen tanks to keep up with the demand. At first it felt like I was making a difference in peoples lives. I’m only an an EMT but it was a small difference and it made me satisfied with my work. After months of taking Covid patients and especially down here in Arizona the same “there isn’t enough research” Covid patients. I have lost a lot of my compassion. I don’t feel bad anymore. Of course I have not given them any lower care than I would another patient but I’m tired. I’m tired of picking up the guy who thought it was the flu but is now saturating in the high 70s and can’t breath. I’m tired of being called a sheep by the same person when they ask if I’m vaccinated cause they are too stubborn to admit they are wrong. I’m tired of waiting at the wall in the ED cause there are no beds. I’m tired of looking at the nurses more tired then me and only being able to apologize.

"For us, we are a hospital of 345 beds, when every single unit is in use, and I remember that we went to 400 beds because we used the OR East rooms and the PACU as rooms as well. We shut down the inflow of non COVID patients and became a Covid exclusive hospital for about 9 months. I remember at one point, we were at 110% capacity, as we had 3 to a room. The ambulance bay had to have security outside to guide the ambulances in and out since there was so many. Every single floor was COVID. The directors didn’t have any gauge as to where they were putting COVID patients and where to leave without patients, so essentially just the restrooms in the connecting bridge from east to west tower was the only safe spot. But entire units we had to gown up outside and then stay gowned the entire time. Doing all this solo for 8 hrs and sometimes even being asked and begged to stay after, although the money was alright, you just felt empty and couldn’t even say no. 

It’s gotten better in those terms but were already prepping the other units that are closed right now for another wave. Never ending wave 😢

I just hope we make it to a day that we can go home and not feel like we are bringing something home. Because like you said, I also have showered in the hospital and slept in the cafeteria and taken that mask off and just gasped for a minute of dress air out in the quad at 4am and felt disappointed to go back in. 

I’ve lost 3 family members through COVID, all pre-existing conditions but exacerbated by COVID and what it does to someone. Just lost my uncle yesterday to COVID, but I just hope a day when this stops. When ppl understand it’s not just about the ppl who survived but about those that need the help to survive. That’s why wearing a mask is important, because ppl need help to have a chance. And those that are immunocompromised and elder and such, they can wear a mask, but need others around to also do so.

"I know how it feels. The pandemic starts and you think it’s gonna be okay, because the system is prepared for this, it’s 2019. And then it happens, nothing is run the way you expect it to be, “quarantine” doesn’t mean quarantine really, you realize everyone else is playing this by ear just like you and it scares the hell out of you. You pull up your belt, and work until sweat is pouring down your back, and it’s okay because you’re doing an essential job, you’re a hero helping humanity.

But what is that hard work met with? A 3% pay raise, no hazard pay, patients refusing to mask up and management not standing behind you, and while the rest of the country has “opened up” you’re still coming into a house of death every morning.

"This all sounds eerily familiar or similar to my experiences here at the hospital. 

We have are a Covid hospital. Which means any patients close to proximity that has Covid, has to come to Good Sam even if they’re at Tacoma General. They have to come here. 

We are at a steady 90%-95% capacity, always. I’ve seen it go down to 89% at one point a month or two ago. 

Still scary to see.

I would walk the dedicated Covid floor and just get an idea of where we are at in it. I would walk past every single room and most of them are a ventilator and they’re just in a coma. 

Most people that are on a ventilator will die. That’s just a fact. If they’re on a ventilator for a long period of time, they will end up having to get surgery to get a hole in their neck to help them continue to breathe. The reason they have to do this is that if it’s left in their throat, it will eventually ruin their vocal cords. 

So imagine the possibility of surviving Covid when you’re that far gone and you make it back. You’re going to wake up with TWO gaping freaking holes in your body. One in your neck and one in your stomach to feed you. 

These are LIFE altering events that you’re going to have to come to terms with. It’s going to screw you up psychologically and physically and you’re going to have to deal with it until it’s fully healed. Even then, you’ll never be 100% the same again. 

It’s super stressful and horrifying to experience seeing these patients while everyone on the outside of the hospital screams, “FAKE NEWS!”. They don’t understand. They don’t get it. They don’t care enough to even learn if it’s true or not. 

We do have an overflowing morgue and we also have a fridge container in the back as well. Super chilling stuff. No pun intended.",t2_1smxjxc,JEFFMBHIBB_Photo,0,1640023857.0,0,t1_hpblelg,hpblelg,False,JEFFMBHIBB_Photo,t3_rkjqrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuyallupWA/comments/rkjqrg/titled_burnt_story_in_the_comments/,"Titled, “Burnt”.

"I’m also an EVS worker for a Kaiser and it is crazy how much work is never ending and feels hopeless. I remember having to reuse N95’s, being told to write our name on them and send them to SPD to processing and cleaning and being told we didn’t have enough gloves or PPE. Not having a single break, and being told to go into the rooms to clean ASAP so they can fill it with 1 patient at first, then 2, and eventually 3 per room. I remember hearing code blue maybe 20x a night for a week on end and seeing the freezers out on the docks lined with patients bodies. The amount of depression and sadness and then emptiness you felt was insurmountable compared to the idea that you didn’t know if this was your time to catch it or not. 

Only rest you could get was hiding away in a corner somewhere and crying and praying for some miracle. Now, this seems like 6th wave of COVID, and the cases are rising again. One simple thing to help us, all of us in healthcare and associated professions have a chance at saving someone’s life, and it’s a shot. It’s a miracle in times of need and, at work, or hospitals, for those that don’t work in one, that’s all we want. A chance to breath again and not go home thinking If Only..

I work for EVS, right alongside the nurses, doctors, surgeons, Radiologist, Respiratory Techs, Admittance clerks, engineers, plant managers, etc., and I can honestly say that I’ve seen them, us, all crack. All break down, all feel helpless and yet, we keep on pushing. We go back in and we keep working, because we care. I’ve tempted to quit but, I’ve seen too many people pass away, hugged too many nurses and seen too many heroes go unnoticed to give up. I might get the shit end of the stick for my job, but, in my mind, I work in a hospital during a pandemic, trying to give ppl a second, third or whatever chance at life, and, that’s the only comfort for me during these times. 

It is a pain and it is stressful and many have left. So, just please, I am pleading with ppl to stay safe, wear a mask and take the shot if you haven’t already. From the entire medical profession, please. It’s the only way we can do our job effectively AND keep your loved ones from coming in and dying in a room that you can’t even visit them in, and have to see them intubated, sedated sometimes, and through a 10.1 inch screen connected to the wall.

"The nurses and like 2 of my managers are pretty appreciative.

There’s not much my managers can do in terms of pay raises. We’re bonded to a contract that was in place just before I got hired. Everything was in place in terms of wages and benefits. 

That contract isn’t up until October officially. Negotiations start in July and the entire EVS team is just done. They are fed up and many have quit. 

We don’t even have Hazard Pay. 

The hospital didn’t even care to do that for us.

And we go into rooms that have MERSA and C-Diff. We go into actual Covid rooms. It’s scary as hell because if you don’t properly dress up in the PPE they provided for you, you can very well still get sick or bring it home to your family.

"It’s been a long and stressful few years here at Good Samaritan. 

When I first started here, I was excited because I’ve always wanted to work in a hospital. To see what it was like, to explore every corridor, to be a part of a system that genuinely helps people, while also being paid a bit more than I had at any job. 

Watching the story played it from the a Trump administration to start of the Pandemic to the eventual January 6th Insurrection. It was all so, very surreal watching it play out in real time. Then, as Covid rages on with now two very new variants. I’m seeing much more of the effects of Covid that professionals said that would happen. 

In the beginning, the CDC as well as Dr. Fauci had said that the hospitals would eventually be overloaded and overwhelmed and nobody believed them. In fact, you got the usual, selfish, right-wing nut job that believes that JFK Jr. Is being revived because of some Q-Anon theory. 

Right now I’m witnessing the very change in the hospital, day in and day out. People are quitting Left and right because the overload of work and relentless amount of cases arising.

I work in Environmental Service. I clean patient rooms for a living and I clean variously different ORs and I know exactly how multiple floors are ran, including the Emergency Departments. 

We are low on staff. Dangerously low and noticeable everyday.  We would have new applications and they would quit before their 90 day review based on seeing the workload and the pay we are being paid to deal with the stuff we have to deal with. 

And they would quit and I do not blame them one bit. 

They’re not quitters, they are seeing the writing on the wall. They are accepting that their mental health is far more important and that’s okay. I agree with that. I’m right there on the edge of quitting. But I’m not just there yet.

There’s nothing wrong with that. 

There was a shift at one point where it was just the 3 of us in charge of the whole building. It was scary, it was a, “Holy shit.” moment for me.

The emergency room is packed. I worked ED alone a day ago because I was the only one available. It was room afar room after room, I was barely able to maintain the utilities by myself and do trash and dashes. It was relentless.

To remind those who are forgetful that Covid is here. It is definitely still here; it is still very, very active and due to The Great Resignation to which I am very, very proud of. We need to be valued, we deserve to feel valued and to have a life worth living.

We all deserve respect. We all deserve to feel like we are living our best lives. 

Yet we are consistently and constantly exhausted too work a non-livable wage while our rent and cost of living consistently and constantly rising beyond our means.

 we are seeing exactly what the professionals said that would happen. 

Everything they said that would happen, is happening right now. 

Right before our eyes. 

Again, we are low staffed, we are exhausted, we are stressed out. 

We need help.

"Grew up here. I'm white. I moved away and came back to save and work until I can move again. Locals who never leave are usually racist and don't understand why. They also get super defensive about being told what they're doing or saying may be racist. Normally they are just passive aggressively racist, but if you encounter a Karen you may get a slur thrown at you and told to go back to your country, or have the cops called on you. The community is also heavily evangelical Christian. So if you have kids be wary of their youth groups. I personally like living in a more open minded and diverse place and plan to move because Puyallup and the surrounding areas aren't that. That being said people will be nice to your face 95% of the time just like any other suburb that thinks it's a small town and if you find a group that likes you you may be lucky enough to become their token POC friend. That being said it is getting more diverse, especially in the last 5-6 years, and younger generations are making it better and more diverse, but it's definitely not there yet. I've brought POC friends home to visit and was quickly embarrassed and noticed more stares and odd behavior then I was aware of before and have had to step in a few times with karens either following my friends in a store or trying to call the cops on them because they “ looked suspicious”. And I personally heard some pretty racist shit said behind peoples backs when I was growing up, along with a lot of racist bullying. So yeah. The area has racists.

"White Washingtonian here, I just want to start by saying that you are definitely welcome in this city. I have grown up and lived in lots of cities around the south sound (Seattle through Olympia) and this area is full of some of the most open minded and genuine people anywhere in the country. This region has a long history of Asian immigration and more recently immigration from Latin America. I think this make most people around here very welcoming of people from different cultures and races, especially compared to some other areas in the US. 

Unfortunately, with the state of American politics being what they are, racism and xenophobia have been emboldened and tied to some people's political identities. Thankfully you won't see much of that here, however, I would say that there are slightly more of those types of people in Puayllup when compared to cities like Olympia or Seattle. This is mostly because Puyallup has been a somewhat rural community until relatively recently. It is still much better than many other areas in the country, and I don't believe that you will encounter any overt hatred or outright racism aimd at you if you decide to make Puayllup your home.

"For this exact reason, we were Y members for a year. I’m originally from federal way and there are two or three community centers there that I grew up in. Found out that when the Y closed down, they were still charging us for child watch. So they lost our business. 

Elite School of Dance is down near canyon/128th and is pretty reasonably priced for kids dance classes. We have had a great experience there so far. We pay like $40/month for one ballet class per week. 

Also, not sure how old your kids are, but you might want to check out the Kaleidoscope Family Gym. It’s down closer to the mall. Indoor activities galore. You get 1.5 hours of play for $13. 

The Tacoma Children’s Museum is free (optional donation upon entering). But their parking costs money. We ended up buying an annual membership just to score free parking.

"I've lived in this area my whole life (40yrs) Graham, Spannaway, Tacoma, Milton, Sumner.

For background, I took these 2 years ago at peak Covid, I contacted a few high level people about wanting to tell the story of Covid and what it looks like because no one actually sees what I see. 

They gave me a contract, no patients, they own them but I’ll get credit and we set up a Dropbox. That was fine with me because I wanted to build a portfolio, I wanted to get to a different position creatively instead of the physically demanding one I am currently in.
