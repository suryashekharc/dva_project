"I generally shop at all those places plus Trader Joe's and even Rainbow Grocery Outlet now and then. Every place has loss leaders that are used to entice people into the store. All of them have a few items with significant mark-ups where they make a bulk of their money. Best I can say is it depends on what you're buying.

If forced to decide overall for our family I'd pick Walmart as the cheapest followed by Safeway then Fred Meyer and a toss up between Amazon Fresh and QFC.

"I think downtown Bellevue is a nice small city for what you described, you can walk to Safeway for groceries and maybe bike to Trader Joe’s or Whole Foods (driving is more common because of the hills), lots of restaurants and cafes in walking distance, and a beautiful downtown park great for walking or people watching. It’s very safe and clean compared to Seattle. There’s the occasional sighting of a homeless person here or there but you won’t see tents or encampments like they have in Seattle. In the past year I’ve seen about two homeless people in downtown Bellevue, whereas going to Seattle I have seen tents and homeless people on every single visit.

There are a few distinct areas of downtown Bellevue: the office area (basically all office buildings like Bravern, City Center, etc, this is the part that feels most sterile and I’d avoid living there); the shopping area (Bellevue Square, Lincoln Square, Cinemark; a bit more lively and upscale but pretty boring stores like Macys, Crate & Barrel, Container Store); and Old Bellevue/Downtown Park (I think this is the nicest area to live, has a small college town/historic vibe on Old Bellevue Main Street with good restaurants, coffee shops, boutique stores, and it’s right next to the park!)

The architecture in downtown Bellevue is a tiny bit like downtown Chicago but on a very very small scale; from downtown park looking towards the high rises, it’s like 0.1x scale of Chicagos millennium park with modern high rises in the background. No historic architecture. The vibe is nothing like New York. Pretty much everything closes by 9pm on weekdays. If you want vibrant nightlife like clubs and bars or just cool restaurants open late, you might need to find that in Seattle.

"I am serious, I had several neighbors car stolen and cops told them they found the car on the road but couldn't engage. So they just let them go. As soon as anyone starts driving your car, cops cant do anything about it.

[https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.116.060](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10.116.060)

(1) A peace officer may not engage in a vehicular pursuit, unless:

(a)(i) There is probable cause to believe that a person in the vehicle has committed or is committing a **violent offense or sex offense** as defined in RCW 9.94A.030, or an escape under chapter 9A.76 RCW; or

(ii) There is reasonable suspicion a person in the vehicle has committed or is committing a driving under the influence offense under RCW 46.61.502;

So unless it was a violent crime or sex offence, or DUI; if a cop sees your stolen car on the road, they CANNOT stop the car, criminals can just run and cops will leave them be. This was the bill HB 1054 passed in 2021[https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1054&Initiative=false&Year=2021](https://app.leg.wa.gov/billsummary?BillNumber=1054&Initiative=false&Year=2021)

The same year where crime went up 20% and our property crime is already 2-3x that of Chicago, Detroit and LA. So you are a statistic, our Legislators have passed laws enabling criminals so it's no surprise you are at least the 4th person whose car was stolen in Bellevue (our neighborhood) in the recent few months (compared to 0 year prior).

Bellevue is safe but there has been a noticeable uptick in homelessness recently due to Seattle starting to clean up. On Saturday I passed a guy smoking meth mid day on NE 10th St. There have been car breakins in some Apartment buildings these past couple of weeks as well. Not sure if these are transients from Seattle or a new influx to stay. Compared to Seattle its much safer and the cops are no nonsense here. The public library and bus stop can get a bit edgy sometimes but I have never heard of anyone getting mugged etc,t2_4q6a3gt8,Wullfman75,0,1647538569.0,0,t1_i11lxp7,i11lxp7,True,soccer_is_lame,t3_texnh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/texnh3/hows_homelessness_safety_in_bellevue/,How's Homelessness & Safety in Bellevue?,/r/BellevueWA/comments/texnh3/hows_homelessness_safety_in_bellevue/i11lxp7/,2,r/BellevueWA,0,2

<<<UPDATE: Destiny and Tristan are being interviewed by Kiro News.UPDATE: Cops are on it, no arrests made yet though. Wesley was in the stroller and the bullet missed him by inch or so. They think person may have actually been aiming at him 😭😭. I called Kiro News. This person is apparently only shooting at people with kids or dogs.UPDATE: it missed his femoral artery by 1/2 inch and actually went through the stroller before it hit him 😭. Police are being updated as it may be an attempted murder charge.UPDATE - X ray says it looks more like a .22 caliber bullet 🙁This what just happened to my son in law while he was walking to his dog with my almost two year old grandson. Yes - that is what it looks - he got shot!!!! The police are investigating by so far no solid leads. We aren't sure of it's a pellet or a small .22 (most likely a pellet). This happened right behind the The Farm apartments in Mill Creek! They barely missed my grandson! Apparently there are a few wild kids that hide behind the fence separating their housing development and shoot at the fence/dogs, but this is the first time they've hit someone aside from construction workers who apparently didn't report them 🤨. I'm 100% comfortable with saying that anyone who lets their children behave like this should have their children permanently removed.

"It's possible to live without a car here but things to keep in mind:

If you have a bike and are very physically fit OR you will become very physically fit. We live in Lake Hills; my wife works on Northeast 8th and 108th.

People living in the Crossroads area or Overlake neighborhood will have similar elevation changes. We're about 4 miles from our house to her office. Here's a topographic map that'll give you a rough idea concerning hills.  https://en-us.topographic-map.com/maps/na3/Seattle/

Alternatively we do have a bus system. Depending on day and time it can work but don't expect Boston or NYC convenience. My wife can catch a bus a few hundred feet from our house. It'll drop her off about a block from her office but it'll take 25 minutes to get there assuming the bus isn't full which it was before the pandemic.

"Bellevue has homeless but we also have several shelters. Additionally our gov't has a much better handle on how to deal with homeless people. We're rather welcoming of nearly anybody in our city as long as they follow laws and other social/societal norms.

If a tent goes up our police will take the person to a shelter. If the person refuses a shelter they're given the choice of jail or leave the area.

Bellevue has crime but it's very minimal. We've lived in ""the shady part"" of Bellevue for 20+ years. About a decade ago we had some porch pirate issues but the cops found the shit-stains and the problem was dealt with. Currently there's a catalytic converter theft issue but we also have a lot of resources going into finding the perpetrators and stopping the problem.

Some people do equate minorities or poor people as a problem; this is far from true around here. Poor people live here despite the really high cost of living. Main reason is people here are willing to work their asses off so they can live in a safe and well ran city. Our schools are great with fantastic teachers. All the police I've chatted with are super nice people with good heads and even keeled tempers. Socially awkward people are pretty well understood; we don't intend to come across as dicks but being socially inept is tolerated.

"https://bellevuewa.gov/city-government/departments/police/police-faqs

**What types of training do Bellevue Police officers receive?**


There are multiple stages of certification and training required to become a police officer. The first stage is Basic Training for Peace Officers through the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission (CJTC).  This academy is for entry-level or new officers and covers a variety of topics throughout the 720-hour curriculum.  The basic curriculum can be found here https://cjtc.wa.gov/, but covers topics such as criminal investigations, criminal law, procedures, people in crisis, use of force, firearms, and patrol tactics.  Built into those curriculums are topics such as implicit bias, unbiased policing, and use of force.  If we hire an experienced officer, or lateral, from outside of Washington State, they must attend a two-week equivalency academy at CJTC. 


This equivalency academy instructs them on Washington State-specific laws and procedures.  


The second stage of training required to be a Bellevue Police Officer is the 227-hour in-house curriculum designed to reinforce skills learned in the academy and topics specific to the City of Bellevue. **This training includes department expectations of officer conduct, ethical behavior, unbiased (anti-discrimination) policing, constitutional law, use of force, firearms, de-escalation, department policies and procedures, and our culture of community policing and engagement. **

 
The third stage is our 16-week Field Training Program. The new officer is assigned to various experienced Field Training Officers to ensure they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities to perform at the high level we demand as a police officer for the City of Bellevue.  After successful completion of field training, the officers continue to be closely monitored and evaluated until they have completed their probationary period, which is usually one year.  


**Our officers are also required to attend annual ongoing training each year. **


**The minimum in-service training required by the state of Washington is 24 hours; however, most complete many more than that.**  Part of this ongoing, annual refresher training specifically addresses unbiased policing, implicit bias, ethics, and use of force.  The minimum 24-hours must also include successfully completing the state-mandated annual Crisis Intervention Training (CIT) course through the WA State CJTC.


**Are officers trained to de-escalate altercations?**


The Bellevue Police Department does require officers to de-escalate.  They are trained to use verbal de-escalation tactics and continue to do so as long there is no immediate threat to the officer or innocent bystanders.  Additionally, having multiple officers respond to calls can be an effective de-escalation tool we use.  We train to use time and distance along with verbal commands.


**De-escalation is incorporated into our yearly in-service, scenario-based training.  These are developed and taught by our certified instructors and are meant to reinforce de-escalation tactics.**

  
All our officers are trained in a state-certified program called Crisis Intervention Training.  After the initial 8 hour or 40-hour training class, we also attend a 2-hour refresher class every year.  Officers also can request trained mental health professionals to respond to scenes when their expertise would be beneficial.",t2_x3yuf,rcc737,0,1647012841.0,0,t1_i0915bx,i0915bx,False,QurGe,t3_tbc6q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/tbc6q6/angry_dude_on_top_the_stoplight_near_chick_fill_a/,Angry dude on top the stoplight near chick fill a on 8th & 116th.,/r/BellevueWA/comments/tbc6q6/angry_dude_on_top_the_stoplight_near_chick_fill_a/i0915bx/,3,r/BellevueWA,0,3

"Airplanes take off and land into the wind. As the wind direction changes, ""flow"" at an airport changes. Taking off and landing into the wind reduces the take off or landing distance needed on the runway.

Winds in the summer are predominantly out of the north, so planes take off to the north before they turn towards their destination.

Winds in the winter are predominantly out of the south so planes are taking off and landing towards the south.

Rain or other precipitation doesn't change take off or landing direction. Winds do shift and cna change in the middle of the day, so airport operations change as needed.

">He's not mentally ill unless you consider being a drunk a mental illness

If he has a repeat tendency of misusing alcohol and having episodes like this.... then yes ineffectively using alcohol can be considered a substance use disorder and lands within mental health. 

Don't get me wrong. It doesn't excuse his behaviors and do you know his support system or story? I've seen this man too. Yes it's uncomfortable and you may find it annoying, but your response comes off as ignorant. 

And what do you expect officers to do? They have limited to no de-esculation training and all they can do is maybe arrest him? That doesn't even address the possibility of varying issues that is leading to the behavior. Also mental health services are limited, there is a lack of open beds, and funding to care for this population is insufficient.

"When Tulloss at A.L. Humphrey House swung his baseball bat with both hands at the Chinese woman's head 500 feet from his shelter, could he be thinking along a similar line?
Reality is wherever I go whoever I deal with people will complain. So much shit happened in my life because people in America don't want to help me. So fuck you I'm swinging!

La Quinta isn't entirely incomparable to Humphrey House because while it's permanent supportive housing, it's designed to be low-barrier, for single men or women with mental, addiction or behavorial issues, and *not* for families with children. The county may not even do criminal background checks. 

It's not a ""safe injection site"" pe se. But one thing is clear so far: that drug use inside the doors are allowed. The drugs don't grow out of thin air, they have to be trafficked and sold, yeah? Would anyone say that there won't be dealers hanging around then? Or do dealers Amazon-deliver with drones nowadays?

Is it then farfetched that the parents are worried about drug issue spreading in schools? Tell me that schools have been immune to drug abuse in America?

Alternatives were proposed such as using the hotel for Mary's place, or for a subsidized senior housing, or for eastside's homeless students etc. Anything that can reduce children safety and drug addiction concerns while still helping those in need. The county bereaucracy simply rejected all with no explanation why single men and women with issues have to live close to schools and daycares while seniors and homeless children should not.

The county deflected on criminal history check and insisted that they will do their own ""screening"". Do they distrust criminal record data? If so, How do they expect local residents trust their guts feeling? Would a normal person want to live in an apartment building with a repeat offender next door? If not, why would a homeless citizen need less? Why do they not deserve living in a building with usual background checks based on data instead of guts feeling? They are already vulnerable.

Throughout this process, the county shows no willingness to address any of the concerns nor desire to be responsible for safety outcomes.

You know why things don't get built in America? It is because of the same irresponsible mindset: fuck you I will do this because I can. And I will not be held accountable if what I do ends up hurting people, so for the heck of it why not? And why would I pause for a second to consider failsafe plans if things go south I go my ways anyway?

It's easy to condescend on NIMBY. But it's a false representation. You can do shit in the backyard, but can you commit to clean up? Not just say ""I will"" but be *really* committed, like, if you fail to clean it up, you feel the same pain as the people you fucked with. 

No politician ever is accountable for any of these social experiment failures. They shit; they move on to grab more power. Some random persons got attacked? Who cares. We don't even talk about it because shit happens. Wasted taxpayer dollars? Don't even mention it.

If one day people can grow up, take responsibility, so the residents whose lives, children, prosperity are 100% in it can feel like the politicians and the social experimenters are in the same boat with them, have the same incentive in cleaning up their own shit, then people will want to work with you; then there won't be as much mistrust and uncertainty; then things will be done; then homeless people will get real help they need because people can finally work together rather than against each other; and we will finally have some success track record to feel good about instead of merely chanting the same old ""we need to solve the crisis"" line over and over again after 10 years of the crisis worsening year over year, simply by blaming your way out all on NIMBY.

I don't know you. But if something I've tried for 10 years has consistently failed so bad that I have not a single good track record to show people, I might take a step back and see if maybe working ""with"" people instead of ""fucking"" them might give a better overall result.

"It is very easy to troll or put label on someone on the internet without truly try to understand the difference between dream and reality. The dream is that we want everyone live in harmony. Homeless and people who have homes all deserve the right to live safely and happily. The reality is you need to know how to do this safely. Homeless population is vulnerable and some (maybe a small number of them) are in trouble and in addiction and need constant care. Kids are also vulnerable. The reality is we need to maintain a balance. How to help homeless population and address safety concerns need to be well planned.

I would not mind if this is built next to my office or if I live close to it if we understand what the safety plan is. If city and county could tell us what are safety measures they are going to put into place to ensure safety of the kids AND the safety of vulnerable homeless population in the hotel, we would love to hear them. Unfortunately we heard none from the city or the county. No plan, no background check, don’t know who will manage or how to manage this facility, don’t know what is the criteria of site selection. They just rush into spending tax payer’s money before funding expires. If this is such a grand thing to do, why would they hide from everyone about it until a whistleblower leaks the information?

The problem is not about helping homeless population or bias towards one group of the people over another.

"No wonder the politicians were rushing so fast to kill off the Houghton Community Council though HB 1769, which overturned the votes of the overwhelming majority of HCC voters in last November's election, and stripped those HCC voters from ever having the right to vote on the issue again.

Houghton already had the most low income housing in all of Kirkland, and the Community Council suggested that low-income housing should be spread equitably though all neighborhoods. But Mayor Penny Sweet disagreed, and wanted to concentrate low-income housing in the farthest corner of her city from her own home.

So Mayor Sweet got her husband - Representative Larry Springer - to ram HB 1769 though the legislature in a short legislative session where it is difficult to mount a defense.  Now Kirkland can dump all of its state-mandated low income housing and homeless shelters into a single neighborhood far away from the political donors.

Mayor Penny Sweet and her husband Larry Springer are Republicans masquerading as Democrats.  I hope they both get primaried by progressives!

EDIT: To be perfectly clear, I support King County's efforts to provide homeless shelter, transitional housing, and supporting long-term housing to people without housing.  I also support the creation of massive amounts of low-income and middle-income housing.  My disagreement with Springer and Sweet is that I believe that ""poor people"" should be able to live in all neighborhoods, rather than piling us into one area where we can be abused and ignored.",t2_di46b,laseralex,0,1646384372.0,0,t1_hzao8yp,hzao8yp,True,BellevueNews,t3_t64k9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/t64k9u/king_county_buys_la_quinta_inn_suites_in_kirkland/,King County buys La Quinta Inn & Suites in Kirkland to become homeless shelter,/r/BellevueWA/comments/t64k9u/king_county_buys_la_quinta_inn_suites_in_kirkland/hzao8yp/,2,r/BellevueWA,0,2

You wrote this morning in your Bellingham post on this same topic that these people won't put your denial in writing. If they refuse to do that then your case isn't denied, it's pending. 

>With DSHS I tried to submit a civil rights grievance 5 times in 12 month period and the never investigated any of the grievances.

You're shooting yourself in the foot. Each time you file a new grievance you reset the clock unless you can clearly show the additional filings are for additional and separate grievances. If that's not clear (for example you copy/paste your grievance like you did this posting across all WA state subs) then the agency will only look at the most recent one. You appear to be complaining about the agency's ability to respond to your case vs actual discrimination. I don't mean to belittle what you are going through but your best approach is to reach out to your state representative in both houses and push for those agencies to get more funding, or find a private attorney to take your case. Non profit and advocacy groups will only take cases they deem highest priority and if yours doesn't qualify and you can't find a private attorney to take it on then you literally don't have a case unless you file yourself, but without a legal background that is almost guaranteed to fail.

"I think I was pretty clear when I wrote: ""I'm looking to connect with anyone in Bellevue or WA state who has faced similar systemic disability discrimination and/or others willing to take action to address systemic disability discrimination in WA"".

Example, if a disabled person requested for a reasonable accommodation for their disabilities from a state entity or one of their contractors and the entity didn't enter into an interactive process, didn't lawfully accommodation, didn't lawfully deny, etc. 

Example, if a person who faced disability discrimination and filed a civil rights grievance and the civil rights grievance wasn't lawfully handled (investigated/resolved).

How much time have you invested in all these outreaches vs asking for supervisors of the employees you describe to address the issues you claim to have experienced?

If you feel you have been wronged or discriminated against by a state employee go to their supervisor first and use lack of follow-through as a basis to file an individual lawsuit against that state entity.

Things to do in Vancouver: Granville Island Public Market (European style indoor food market with food court and fresh produce), Richmond (Asian food), Capilano Suspension Bridge Park (expensive but nice at night if the light display is still up), shopping (Lululemon stuff is cheaper in Canada; Arcteryx outlet store at their HQ)

Things to do in Portland: Donuts (I like Blue Star but there are a few other famous ones), shopping (no sales tax so anywhere is fine).

Both cities also have nature/ourdoorsy things to explore but they are probably nicer in the other seasons.

Peony outing at Pure Peonies farm

Public · Hosted by Bel La, WA Plants, Flowers and Mushrooms Free, Sale and Exchange and WA Plants, Flowers and Mushrooms Free, Sale and Exchange

Saturday, May 21, 2022 at 8:00 AM – 11:00 AM PDT

[Everson, Washington](https://www.ci.everson.wa.us/) - About 20 minutes northeast of Bellingham.

Let's go support a local business and enjoy beautiful flowers.

We'll head to the farm early in the morning as it's a long drive, the farm is about 3 hours North of Bellevue. We can meet and carpool, and those who live closer to the farm can time yourselves to meet up with the group there. Ideally we want to be there by noon. 

The farm has more than 200 varieties of peonies. We're free to take pictures, do a little picnic, etc. Bring cash if you want to buy hand cut peonies or peony plants. Maybe a small cooler filled with cold beverages, sandwiches, and sides to enjoy on a blanket right at the farm. And possibly a tripod, or we can help take pictures for each other.

Please make sure to wear masks inside the cars if you carpool with others and practice safe COVID protocols to ensure your and everyone's safety.

There’s plenty of space to not be in anyone’s way while still enjoying our time there. 

You can leave anytime, spending a few hours is never enough for your eyes and soul but your feet might scream at you. We'll likely leave around 4PM.",t2_x3yuf,rcc737,0,1644771106.0,0,t1_hwsnopg,hwsnopg,True,fgurubunnies,t3_sq95lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/sq95lh/heres_one_that_everyone_can_attend_although/,"Here's one that everyone can attend, although outside of Bellevue.

"The bike map is really useful. Take note of the roads in red - these have fast-moving heavy traffic, and people are not expecting or looking out for bikes (or pedestrians) on some of these. Crossroads is especially treacherous. If you're new to riding in a city and/or just want to avoid traffic, you can generally find safer routes, but they may take you a bit out of your way. For travel across the lake, the 90 and 520 bike lanes are great and heavily used, especially in the summer. Downtown now has protected north-south bike lanes on 108th on both sides of the street, but 4th and 8th are terrible for getting east-west.

As others have noted - visibility is really important. Hi-viz neon jacket or shirt, back light, helmet light, and even side or tire lights that are visible to drivers coming towards you at a 90-degree angle. If you're in the dark and rain, you can be almost invisible without these.  

Except for some of the recreational cycling routes like the Evergreen-Overlake-Lake Washington Blvd route that is really popular on weekends, I don't see tons and tons of cyclists out on the city streets here, so it just helps to be aware that drivers may be less used to (and aware of) cyclists than say Seattle proper. Though I bike commuted for years in Seattle and it was often not great or safe experience there, either.  

In summary, be aware of your surroundings, stay lit up, keep safe, and find routes that work for you.

"I just rented a house in 98007 for $3350. If you can stomach 3k you can find a small home.

Before this I lived in the Park Highland apartments. Similar to any other cookie cutter apartments but it was nice bc those apartments border the botanical gardens which have trails and a little coffee shop. With utilities I think it came to $2600 for a two bedroom. A one bedroom will be around 2k I imagine.

Yeah... sorry, it's an expensive area! If you're living alone then just rock a 1 bedroom. But at $2600 vs $3350... this house is about 3x the size plus a garage, around 2500 sq ft I think. We got a bit lucky though, it's an older house, nothing fancy, but most houses this size are around 4k. For 3k you can find about a 1500 sq ft place. It's hard to find a place when you don't live here though. One option is to find a standard apartment online and plan to break the lease, which will cost you a month's rent, but that would probably be cheaper than doing month to month. Month to month leases seem like they tack on a huge amount, maybe 30 or 40%",t2_gl4gq,Dudeman3001,0,1644197022.0,0,t1_hvvxrku,hvvxrku,True,Brielle1102,t3_sm6ri4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/sm6ri4/apartment_in_bellevue_98007/,Apartment in Bellevue (98007),/r/BellevueWA/comments/sm6ri4/apartment_in_bellevue_98007/hvvxrku/,2,r/BellevueWA,0,2

"I am very sorry that there was retaliation between you and your employer, that your claim was denied with ESD, and most of all for the impact that it had on you and your family and your son.

I inferred from the question about accountability that you have mostly moved on from the disqualification with ESD, unfortunately the only subject in the multitude of issues you are facing that I can effectively help with.

In the off chance that I have not understood the nature of your reply in that you want to and are willing to discuss the disqualification and possible actions that could lead to solutions:


>They also denied my claim because they said I worked for DSHS

Who was your employer from whom you separated when you made your initial claim filing for unemployment benefits?

Generally speaking, ESD must include a selection of laws under which the disqualification was invoked, for which I have made a troubleshooter to locate those laws on the letters:

"I would like to know how my claim of retaliation was never approved or sent to L & I. This was after August when I left my career as a paraeducator because my employer was not connecting or making an effort to complete the corrective action from my first state complaint to OSPI. The retaliation by a previous action of mine (reporting harm in March 2018) had reached epic proportions and I believe was the reason the district was not connecting my son. At the same time ESD department was rampant with fraud. At the time that my claim was up for decision, ESD was shorthanded and had national guard assisting. Were they assisting on making decisions as well? They also denied my claim because they said I worked for DSHS. When I no longer was employed, I signed up to be my disabled sons personal care provider. I was exempt because I was taking care of my own son whose minutes were paid out of his personal care plan. Denied from the most mis-managed (just inching out DSHS) state agency in Washington State. My case should have had eyes on it and been referred. Instead, I got no unemployment for the entirety of the pandemic. I had to use what little I had in my 401K to get us moved out of state where I am still trying to connect my son to his supposed federally protected education. Its been over 700 days since he has seen education, services, or peers. He turns 20 next month. Was 17 at closure in Redmond, WA. I am losing hope fast he will be reconnected in KY. Where if he was, I could file a complaint with DOJ and possibly go back to work. But never in education again. Not after what I have seen, my Autistic son has been through and not after watching colleagues stand silent to it all. This should have never happened to my son and I have had to remain persistent in advocating for justice for him in a county of bad actors-key communicator networks -mismanaged agencies and places that say one thing and do another behind close doors.

"Not really.

This article is worse than the Seattle Times one it attempts to criticize.  Rather than invest the time in directly countering the concerns raised by the times it instead does character assassination against the paper.

The editorial referenced is here: https://www.seattletimes.com/opinion/editorials/legislature-should-reject-plan-to-upend-single-family-zoning/

The crux of the Time's reasoning isn't that upzoning is bad, its that unless additional controls are added to get developers to build affordable housing, you just get developers catering to the high end of the market.

I don't think will be the case, but it could be a problem and is one worth legitimately discussing instead of telling me that a paper endorsed George Bush, someone who hasn't been relevant for nearly 15 years.

The Time's uses actual data in it's analysis of Seattle, something that the Urbanist doesn't address.  One example is below:

> Among the 224 market-rate projects that were subject to MHA’s requirements in 2020, 219 chose to pay fees, while only five agreed to include some affordable housing, yielding 21 on-site units. The program raised $68 million in fees.

That's significant and may indicate that the change in housing prices in Seattle might be due to other reasons, like the pandemic.  The Urbanist simply says that the 68 million in fees is a win, it doesn't show how many actual affordable houses were created as a result or where those fees went.  I did some searching and couldn't find any serious data.  

[Similar projects](https://projects.seattletimes.com/2022/seattle-king-county-homeless-promises-outcomes/) in solving problems where housing is a solution are decidedly a mixed bag though.

Given the overhead costs in our government, its likely only a fraction of that money made it's way to somewhere impactful.

Anyways, that's a lot of words to say the Urbanist's article is trash and that's why it deserves the downvotes.",t2_aodbl,gettingoutaccount,0,1643582676.0,0,t1_huwxneg,huwxneg,False,[deleted],t3_se3f5t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/se3f5t/seattle_times_wrong_again_siding_with_exclusion/,"Seattle Times Wrong Again, Siding with Exclusion and Housing Scarcity",/r/BellevueWA/comments/se3f5t/seattle_times_wrong_again_siding_with_exclusion/huwxneg/,0,r/BellevueWA,0,0

"> The press can't get government to talk to them? Gee I wonder why.

I'm with you all the way and adding:

My 2nd major back in college was journalism. It took less than one semester to ""nope"" the hell out of that mess. Before starting on actual journalism classes we had to have 2 semesters of basic college grammar/writing. Journalism 301 (might have been 201; really can't remember) started in on fact gathering including interviews. We were taught that we are employees first who's job is to capture the biggest audience possible. This is accomplished by using facts wrapped up in adjectives and adverbs along with some well placed ""could be"" and ""can happen"" along with ""might go this direction"" type crap.

Part way through the semester I went home and chatted with my dad. He had left the journalism industry in 1986 and still had a considerable amount of knowledge regarding how it worked. So my moral compass was being pushed to the breaking point while in class, he threw that compass on the ground and stomped on it.....and that ended my desire to go into journalism.

"Yeah I've heard that as well, super rich people don't mind giving money away, they just don't want to give it to the government. Valid perspective. And there are a lot of good rich people who do good things. Like Bill. We'll see about Elon.

But I would love to see some more statistics on this. Because I've also heard that estate planners have one heck of a hard time bc people identifier with their money in their old age and tend not to give it away. And the government comes and takes their 15% anyway and the of the idiot children don't lose the money or spend it on the dumbest things, their children do. I forget what the stat was but it's large, maybe 99% of fortunes are lost in 3 generations. But also... that's when we were talking millions, I think today's billion dollar fortunes are somewhat unprecedented.

No, nothing about money is black and white. I don't think that most people understand that it's an invention and created out of thin air and then dispersed through this elaborate system called the economy and government. Currently, we end up with large concentrations of it by some individuals. Fair or unfair, good or bad, hard to say. Better than the gulags. And at the moment nobody can pay to live forever. We don't have to guillotine the rich, we just have to wait, and when the day comes where Bezos or Elon kick the bucket, everyone gets a free steak dinner and then it's back to business as usual.

It's easy for me to say ""tax the 51st million at 80%!"" but then everyone who makes more than 50 million might take up residence in Luxembourg or Dubai or wherever. Not a simple problem at all.

I agree that higher tax brackets could potentially be a good thing, but maybe it just causes people to put more effort into cheating on their taxes in practice? Also, many rich people are philanthropists anyway, which may be a more effective use of the money (especially as the government is notoriously inefficient and wasteful). e.g. Bill Gates's foundation has benefitted humanity greatly - but if that money had gone to taxes, maybe it just means a bigger military budget or something.

"I'm not a ""kill the evil billionaires! We'll all be rich!"" type liberal. But it looks like they got him for the max 40.8%.

So I'm not an ""off with their heads! To the gulags!"" type but I do think the uber wealthy could pay a little more on their 21st or 101st million.

Also it looks Elon paid peanuts these last couple years. It's like this 11 bil payment is a (rather expensive) publicity stunt. Could he have avoided that if he had made some type of investment?

I wouldn't speak to a reporter on anything. They just want to make a fool of you.

""But it's possible you are wrong.""

""It's unlikely that this research...""

""Do you think you don't make mistakes?""

We've all seen interviews of this type. Nobody wants to talk to someone like that.

In fact I left the public sector in part due to the sheer lack of moral support from my community. I didn't expect to be lauded but at every turn we constantly were berated as wasteful idiots in the press.

"If you can afford to live in Bellevue, you can probably afford to buy a bike. (Of course this is not always true!) 

I live in Bellevue myself. My first thought is to wonder what neighborhood you live in. Neighborhoods like Downtown, Crossroads-Overlake or Eastgate might be okay for using a bicycle to get around, but most others are not great. Bellevue has many hills, it often rains here, and the city was built for cars. It's getting better—things will be quite different in three to five years—but today it is still building.",t2_2upmws79,satsukikorin,0,1643064457.0,0,t1_hu2ysii,hu2ysii,True,Alyona_Piispanen,t3_sbvho5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BellevueWA/comments/sbvho5/rent_bike/,Rent bike,/r/BellevueWA/comments/sbvho5/rent_bike/hu2ysii/,4,r/BellevueWA,0,4
"I don't know a place that would rent long term and going with daily rates it would only take you very few weeks to spend enough on rental fees that it would make more sense to buy one, so your only real option is to buy one. Seattle has a store called ""recycled cycles"" where they sell used ones if you're on a budget (and you can ride home from there over the 520 bridge trail). If you're not on a budget, I'd consider an ebike - there are serious hills in Bellevue which require quite a workout which you may not want if you only need to go shopping. Depending on your route, Bellevue can be good or bad for bicycling - I've been bicycle commuting here for almost 10 years, but I am lucky because the 520 bike trail works for my route quite well.
