"I was told that at the area between Grand Ave and el Norte is the main area to avoid. There are some nice spots South of Grand Ave too. 

**Old Escondido** is the historic district and it is a really cute area and it is walking distance from Grande Ave (Downtown Esco)  which is a nice area to walk around. I think there are rules if you live there like any work you have to do on the house must maintain the character of the house. This might be a deal breaker for some people but I think that is also part of why its such a cute neighborhood with so much character. 

The areas around **Kit Carson Park and Lake Hodges** are also south of Grand and are really nice areas. Plus Kit Carson park is a big beautiful park with lots of art, sports, recreation, so it would be nice to live close to there.

Some people like the Esco area west of the 15, I think it's a bit more of cookie cutter homes over there. And I think there is a neighborhood called **Vineyard** over there and there are a bunch of wineries which is kinda nice.

Someone said to avoid **Tulip st** which I have to disagree with. The houses aren't anything fancy in that area but it is also close to some wineries and walking distance to many grocery stores and close to everything, plus it is right off the 15 and not horribly overpriced yet. Also the famous Peterson's doughnuts is there.

I recently moved to Escondido and I am not sure why it gets such a bad rap. If you go to downtown San Diego, the problems with homelessness and crime are worse. Esco downtown is cute and has a community vibe with lots of restaurants, a farmers market, and a weekly  event called ""Cruisin' Grande"" in the summers. And you can still find free parking in Esco downtown. I kind of feel like it is a hidden gem of an area. Everyone wants to live in those walkable neighborhoods with the cute shops etc. But people don't realize we have that in Esco yet.  I am sure that as it gets harder and harder to find reasonable housing in other places that people will start coming this way and realizing what we have.

"North Esco seems to attract a decent amount of car chases.  They always seem to end up there.

"Escondido is much more diversely populated than many parts of Upstate New York. You'll find it in the diversity of food options, which are outstanding. 

The 78 fwy corridor is the gateway to the coast, the 15 fwy will get you north and south (inland). Try getting a Toll Fwy/Carpool Lane transponder for your car when traffic gets heavy on the 15 during rush hour. Having a car is a must.

">his idea that the land was “stolen” by the U.S. is utter garbage talk.

How do you think we got the land that now makes up the US? You think it wasn't previously inhabited? We just arrived here and was like ""Oh, look at all this open space with no humans. I guess it's ours now.""? No, that's not how it happened. There were so many wars and battle other than the revolutionary war and civil war. The land that is now the US was taken from the previous inhabitants. Now, this is the point where you're really offended because you think our country has some sort of God given right to the land. You think we are this holy righteous country that has never done anything wrong. You probably think that teaching slavery to high schoolers should be banned because it illustrates the evils of our country. But that's life and you cant change the facts. Nor should you feel guilty for what our country has done to get to this point since this is how humanity worked for thousands of years. You're territory vs state argument is stupid, it doesn't matter how Mexico felt about the land, how they treated the land or anything, it was there's and now it's ours. Its the same with Guam, if another country were to take it over, the history books would say ""This country used to be American, but now belongs to China due to the treaty of ""We'll give you Guam if you dont nuke Hawaii"".",t2_2wbg9b05,Cynical_Satire,0,1645981583.0,0,t1_hynx8lw,hynx8lw,False,[deleted],t3_t0tte1,https://www.reddit.com/r/escondido/comments/t0tte1/job_offer/,Job offer,/r/escondido/comments/t0tte1/job_offer/hynx8lw/,1,r/escondido,0,1

"From your own link: Following the Mexican War of Independence, it became a territory of Mexico in April 1822\[2\] and was renamed Alta California in 1824.  

Also: Neither Spain nor Mexico ever colonized the area beyond the southern and central coastal areas of present-day California and small areas of present-day Arizona, so they exerted no effective control in modern-day California north of the Sonoma area, or east of the California Coast Ranges.

However to support my point: Most of the areas formerly comprising Alta California were ceded to the United States in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the Mexican–American War in 1848.

"I'm born and raised in San Diego.  I have never lived in Escondido, but I own a business there, and live about 5 miles away (used to live about 15 miles away, much closer to the beach).  IMO there are plenty of places, with a reasonable commute, if you ended up not liking Escondido itself.  San Diego county is very diverse, and each town has it's own vibe.

There is a fair amount of diversity in Escondido itself, you just have to look for it a bit.  There is a strong hispanic community, and there are multiple Asian cultures well represented.  The downtown Escondido area will have the most walkable, ""fun"" stuff to do, like farmers markets, street fairs, the art center/concerts/shows, nightlife, Cruisin Grand, etc.

It's situated close enough to the foothills/mountain that there is quite a lot of easily accessible outdoor recreation options.  There are tons of hiking areas, fishing lakes, recreation vehicle areas, etc close by.  The beach is about 15 miles (as the crow flies), and downtown SD is probably about 45 min away.

Escondido is still relatively affordable, when compared to other areas, but a little older, a lot of the time.

We tend to be very outdoorsy, compared to a lot of other places, so a lot of our ""stuff to do"" is not going to be in the city you live in directly.",t2_u4sij,Hippopotasaurus-Rex,0,1645813453.0,0,t1_hyetkjl,hyetkjl,False,[deleted],t3_t0tte1,https://www.reddit.com/r/escondido/comments/t0tte1/job_offer/,Job offer,/r/escondido/comments/t0tte1/job_offer/hyetkjl/,3,r/escondido,0,3

"I like escondido/poway as a home because they are in the middle of different environments/sub regions all within 45min.

The Rural/mountainous East has hiking, outdoorsy adventures, Bates Nut Farm, mt Palomar, various small lakes, dirt biking, and camping.  Right now there is snow in Julian and other places if you have snow chains/cables.

The urban/coastal West has Beaches, sea world, Belmont park, breweries, bowling their coastal fun activity businesses like soCalAxe(axe throwing +brewery), boomer's mini golf, and different shopping centers. And much more.

-To the South there is San Diego City for clubbing (gas lamp) and whatever urban sprawl activities in conjunction to their beaches.  Mission bay is a great place to picnic or rent jetskis.  Balboa park is a must and so is the San Diego zoo.

-To the north, temecula, you have vineyards.  I recently went to one with a small ice rink.

These different sub-regions have all sorts of activities where you can meet different people with different hobbies... if you're approachable. 

Escondido itself has a safari park with lions, rhinos, and all sorts of big animals on an open range.  Dixon+wohlford lakes are good for fishing, kit Carson park is a great place for going on walks, frisbee golf, and other sports.
Cruisin Grand is our car show in ""downtown"" escondido where people gather to look at grandpa's tricked out ride.

"Ive lived here since 2000 and yeah, compared to most of the county, Escondido seems to have nothing to offer, which can be both true and not true depending on what you're looking for. In my opinion, we do have a somewhat strong night life, but it's all on Grand Ave, but I don't think we're the *goto* destination for clubbing.

We have a lot of breweries, we also have streets fairs once a month or something on grand (though I have no idea what the state of this is since covid hit), we have bars, we have a cinema. All of this, though, is mostly on Grand Ave or around that general area.

Outside of here on the peripheries of the city, we have the Safari Park, we have a lot of hiking trails, we have a pretty big mall near the 15, we have a couple of parks, we also have two big public pools at Grape Day Park and on Washington street. AFAIK these are open only during the summer.

Overall, though, I don't think Escondido is a tourist trap and if you're coming to live here for some cool Instagram stories, then I'm sorry to disappoint.

I think Escondido is a great place to live, though. Pretty chill yet at the same time still a bustling busy city.

"So I'm not born & raised in Escondido; I grew up in Alabama then moved to San Diego and rented for awhile, then almost 2 years ago my husband and I bought a house in Escondido. We liked San Diego, but buying in the city just wasn't plausible; both for the price and what we wanted. I did not think I'd like living here but honestly I've grown to really enjoy it!

We're a short drive to SD or the beaches. As far as what we do for fun, Grand Ave has some great options for dining and a comedy club too. Stone Brewing isn't too far away, and we're close enough to go to some good wineries too. Escondido also has parks and hikes close by. We also go camping quite a bit and it's nice to be a little closer for that. Also the safari park is up here and it's a cool place to go to.

Escondido is definitely growing. Since we purchased our home, the estimated value has increased big time. People are spreading out from SD proper, so it's a good time to buy. 

Also - Escondido has some of the BEST Mexican food I've ever had in my life. Get a Cali burrito, if you haven't yet.

I feel like it is pretty diverse here. But then again; diversity was lacking where I grew up. But there's all different kinds of people living here from all walks of life, and I like that.

It might look a bit older & worn, but I feel like there's definitely some gems up here. I would love to be closer to the city, but honestly it's worth it to live further out and have a nice house with a yard for my dog.

" I've personally lived in Escondido for 8 years and before that I grew up in Rancho Bernardo. The biggest thing Escondido has going for it are Grand Avenue and Cruisin Grand. The one unique feature I love about Escondido is that it is a city but you are still within 10-15 minutes  the countryside with lakes. If you like hiking I recommend Daley Ranch or the Piedras Pintadas Trailhead on the other side of Lake Hodges. 

Just like any other place, Escondido is what you make of it. The outskirts of town are mostly gated communities near golf courses. Central and Downtown Escondido are decent enough, being the heart of the city, comprised of Grand Ave and Broadway, with City Hall. There are a lot of good restaurants and shops in Escondido for you to visit too especially on Grand Avenue.   
  
The cost of living in Escondido is getting a bit expensive in my opinion, but look hard enough, you can find decent places to live and fair prices. Escondido is quite literally, hidden in the center of it all. So You might also want to consider Valley Center, which is basically up in the hills that lead to the Indian reservations that have the local casinos. To the west are the beaches of Oceanside.

"Well In my experience with a 19ft most rv camping/resort facilities offer two types of lot to rent. 

Dry docking is like no water, no power hookups. Just like camping without RV amenities.

Then there’s two types of overall classes for large rvs and trailers which is pull through and back in.

So you basically have two levels of accommodation that scale according to convenience.

Pull through means your drive up like a gas pump hook up usually on a level plot and your good to go.

Back in is exactly what it implies, cheaper but usually more work with less ideal amenities like good views and such, this is on the count that pull throughs are often on a shoulder that’s been widened and at lake Dixon there’s a lot of that as it’s all on hill sides.

"We moved here about a year ago. However we’ve lived around SD County for 5 years.

"I would call Escondido ""ok"". Its not great, but it's not bad. We have good parts of town and bad parts, just like any city. Food options are OK. If your boyfriend is working here, I would suggest looking to get a place to stay in San Marcos, Oceanside, or Carlsbad. Each has it's perks. Oceanside is cheaper than pretty much anywhere else in San Diego County, closer to the beach, and has decent food option. The negatives are, lots of marines, since its cheaper there the community isn't so nice. San Marcos has ""college town"" vibes, plenty of great places to eat and hang out with a younger crowd like yourselves. Not many negatives for San Marcos except its a little pricier than Escondido but still comparable. Carlsbad, well, is really nice. Lots of great places to eat/hang out, plus it's closest to the nicer beaches in North County San Diego. Its also the most expensive, but I think it's worth it. If I had the option, I would chose to live in Carlsbad. But I don't because my wife commutes south to Poway and the commute from Carlsbad would not be fun.

"For thrifting, check out Amvets in Escondido, or the Escondido World Marketplace (It's a flea market. I don't remember which days it is open). There are also several swap meets that occur on specific days around the county: Kobey's Swap Meet, Santee Swap Meet, Spring Valley Swap Meet, and the National City Swap Meet.

Escondido is pretty easy to navigate. It isn't that big of a city. Hell, North County San Diego isn't really that big and the freeways and highways make it easy to get around. That said, the 78 is a nightmare at peak traffic hours, so plan accordingly.

Escondido is in kind of a sweet spot. It is far enough inland that you don't experience the May grey and June gloom that the coastal parts of San Diego experience. At that time of year, the marine layer can hang around all day without burning off if you live on the coast.

If you like beer, do yourself a favor and have a drink in the gardens at Stone Brewing. If you like Mexican food, you are going to love any place you walk into in Escondido (Except Hernandez Hide-Away. Fun date spot down by Lake Hodges, but the drinks are expensive and the food is not good). If you like seafood, Brigantine is quite good.

The best beaches in North County San Diego for hanging out are Moonlight Beach, Buccaneer Beach in Oceanside, and Oceanside harbor. If you want to go check out Oceanside pier, there is a train called the Sprinter that runs from Escondido to Oceanside. The Oceanside stop is within walking distance of the pier.If you have a dog, Dog Beach in Del Mar is great.

The best beaches for learning to surf in North County San Diego are probably Grandview or Beacons.There are several nice hiking trails around Lake Hodges and up at the Daley Ranch. There is a campground and some decent rock climbing up by Dixon Lake if you are into climbing. There is more good rock climbing down in Mission Gorge (also fun hiking). In March and April the hiking out near Anza-Borrego is glorious.

The San Diego Zoo Safari Park is expensive, but it is hands down the best zoo I have ever been to. It is just east of town.

The snorkeling at the cove in La Jolla is amazing. Check out the seals at Children's pool if you go venture down there.And if you venture closer to San Diego, the Point Loma Tide Pools are a lot of fun. To get to the tide pools, you have to drive through Fort Rosencrans National Cemetery. I like to park and walk out into the Cemetary because the view of downtown San Diego is unreal. There is a fee to get in to the area south of the cemetery where the tide pools are (it's called Cabrillo National Monument).

If you like to ski, Big Bear/Snow Summit is your best bet. Mountain High is a little closer, but they usually get even less snow than Big Bear.

If you are willing to venture a little further and enjoy camping, the two adventures I recommend to anyone moving to southern California are Sequoia National Park (it's about a five hour drive) and Santa Cruz Island (1 hour ferry ride from Ventura harbor which is theoretically only three hours from Escondido, but with LA traffic it takes much longer).

Good luck with the move and thank you for listening to my TED Talk.

"Idk if NY has bad drivers but this town DEFINITELY has some bad drivers so please be on the lookout. Too many redlight runners, take a second or two before proceeding, It will save your life. Also invest in a dash cam, most ""bad drivers"" dont have the proper credentials to drive around here.

Anyways theres a few thrift shops around town, Theres like 3 Ross locations and you'll find some treasures there trust! Found some NMD adidas for $35 lmao, the color was bright and ugly but hey, I can resell it to someone whos looking for bright colored Adidas for profit lol. 

Since its Socal, theres a few mexican food spots thats definitely worth trying. 

Aint no subways here but from what i observe the transportation options here are pretty reliable. I live next to a bus stop and i notice it frequently. It's not 24 hours but they do run late and start early. 

Umm I'm 31 and my fiance is 25 with 2 kids, its fairly safe to live here, theres definitely areas to avoid at night but thats everywhere. Its usually central escondido that gets a lot of police activity. I know because i work graveyard and in central escondido lmao. 

Location wise i mean it sits right in the middle of everything san diego has to offer. 20 min drive to the beach, 25 min drive to downtown SD for the nightlife, about 30 mins to camp pendleton. 70-90 min drive to the nearest mountain resort or to the dessert. Theres also a lake for fishing in town and a few others around the area. 

\*\*Political stuff\*\*\*

its about 50/50. Red and Blue everywhere but they're not in your face about it. Everyone is pretty respectful as long as you put out the same energy. 

theres also a FB group you can join for more info about whats going on around town. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: ""Escondido is aight, you'll have to actually live here for like a good year or two to actually appreciate what the city or the location has to offer."" Plus its one of the only cities in SD county that has one of the lower housing rates although its climbing higher and higher since were attracting new tenants all over the county.""

"Scam titled ""Help with Dog Food""

Putting this out there given this person has been running this scam all over reddit for about a month now. They delete their posts so there is no way for someone to search when these posts do pop up. Hence me putting this here.

The scam is soliciting help in various city subs. They will use very specific addresses to seem legit, claiming that their car broke down and they need assistance. They also list their CashApp ID ($hopefiendd and $badatlove1992) as an alternative method of assistance, hoping that people will just send them money instead of making the trip down to the location (they aren't there).

If you see posts with these specific details, flag it. There are a lot of people out there who legitimately need assistance and it pisses me off to see someone taking advantage of kindness.",t2_4w1wj6md,aiugrum,0,1639173875.0,0,t1_ho1j8xj,ho1j8xj,True,[deleted],t3_rdgxw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/escondido/comments/rdgxw8/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/escondido/comments/rdgxw8/deleted_by_user/ho1j8xj/,2,r/escondido,0,2

The RB location has an outdoor patio that joins with the indoor portion - so maybe that’s the plan. Unsure why all the boards otherwise. Poway also just opened so maybe crews will speed things up.

"A little late, but hope some Escondido residents can respond.

I'm a senior in New England, thinking about relocating to San Diego and around. Have been casually browsing the house market.

Many years ago, my family in Carlsbad took me to a restaurant in Escondido. It was located on a street with other stores, and had a neighborhood feeling. I casually mentioned that it could be a nice place to relocate to.

As already mentioned here, and told by my family, Escondido is hotter than San Diego. But I am having a hard time finding out how much hotter. There are many sites with average temperature, but that's not very helpful. For example, is there much temperature difference between Escondido and Rancho Bernardo? I lived outside of Sacramento for a few years, and could not stand that kind of heat.

I am interested in a single, one story house (preferably not a track house). +55 communities would be fine. One like this would be perfect (assuming bearable temperature and in a good neighborhood):

You don’t “repair” then it’s not cost effective just toss in the recycling bin. In Escondido case they put it in front so you can have for free. Shelving the books cost doesn’t change just because you have more books the amount you need to shelf isn’t going to change. You will still have the same daily average just a larger selection.

"You thinking too transaction oriented, and not about operations. 

There’s fixed and variable models, a fixed model is 1:1 

If I have 100 books, and need them shelved, checked, flagged for repair, etc; I have a labor and process cost. I hire someone and they handle these tasks without issue. 

Now I get a donation of 100 more books. 

If I have 200 books, the labor and process cost has the potential to double (fixed). This is where process efficiency comes in, perhaps person 1 figured out a system, trains person 2; between person 1 and 2 the job is being done in 1.5 peoples worth of hours (variable). Now we try to cut that half a person, or find a half a person’s worth of workload to fill gaps

I haven’t even gone into facilities cost. Power, water, repairs, pest control, and (this is the one people overlook a lot) environmental controls (heat+ac)
Cleaning and lighting costs are fairly static, but the amount of energy required to effectively dry and cool books is a variable based on the volume and density of books. 

I get your anger, it’s upsetting, libraries are supposed to be a free bastion of knowledge; and seeing them bare makes one feel icky. 

I would also note, that they have modernized a good bit. There’s a library backed ebook system, so a lot of the books you think are “missing” from shelves may just be digital now.

"Do you want an apartment or a house? Budget?

As for areas to avoid, the central part of town has older apartments and random crime (car break-ins, theft) that use usually a crime of opportunity (basically don't leave shit in your car unless you want someone to steal it). Country club area (north Esco) seems to be a car chase magnet.

I've lived at 3rd and Ivy (small apt complex with no frills), 9th and Juniper (2 bed house) and I'm currently near Bear Valley and San Pasqual Valley Rd (county, everyone has at least 1/2 acre, no sidewalks/street lights).  I've never felt unsafe in any place.

While rent is cheaper in Esco, it can still be $2k-$4k a month.

If you want a house, you might want to check FB groups and nextdoor. Some stuff will be on Craigslist. And you might want to come down for a few days and check out neighborhoods.  The house i rented, i found by driving by it and calling the # on the sign.

"I moved here recently from SD proper. I liked that Esco has a lower price point for housing compared to the rest of SD, but that it is right off of the 15 which makes it a quick commute to many places in SD. You can live in a walkable/bikeable area here where everything in the town is a 5 min drive or a 20 min bike ride away for an affordable price. This meant a lot to me because unless you live in one of the expensive hip neighborhoods like North Park or Hillcrest, a lot of the neighborhoods in SD proper can feel boring and soulless and anything interesting will be a 20 min drive away. There are tons of things that the city can offer families.  Kit Carson park is super nice and has a sculpture garden as well as a frisbee golf court, a sports center with a roller rink and skate park. Cruisin' Grand (free car show event) happens every Friday night. There are lots of good sports programs and class offerings with the rec. center. There are a ton of different grocery store options (my two favorites are both 5 min from my house). Stone brewery is in Esco, it has a super nice garden area to eat in and is family friendly, people drive from out of the area to eat there. There are also several wineries in the area.

As far as neighborhoods, I think there is something for everyone. If you want more of the country feel and a big lot of land, you can find that in North or South Escondido, If you want more of a suburban cookie cutter HOA neighborhood you can get that in West Esco. Central-South Central Escondido is a bit more urban but also very walkable and close to downtown and has cute houses. Old Escondido is a super cute historic neighborhood that is close to everything.

I was told the bad parts of Escondido are mainly between El Norte and Grand Ave. The downtown area (near Grande Ave) is actually quite nice, it has a lot of cute shops and restaurants and a farmers market but it has typical issues of an urban area. You will see homeless people in this area and people on drugs, etc just like you would in any city. And there are gangs in the area although I have not had issues with them. I do feel a bit less safe than I did in my suburban neighborhood compared to how I feel in Esco just because I have heard about the high crime rates and because its a socioeconomically and racially diverse area, you won't be surrounded by only rich white people. Some people are uncomfortable with that. I think it is nice to have the diversity after living for years in the boring bubble of the UCSD area.  People here seem down to earth and friendly.

I definitely recommend that you check out the area. There are good and bad neighborhoods like in any city. Just make sure you walk around in the neighborhood and get a feel for it before committing to any housing decisions.",t2_isexy,baller_unicorn,0,1629972409.0,0,t1_haen3bp,haen3bp,True,uncle___jesse,t3_pb5igd,https://www.reddit.com/r/escondido/comments/pb5igd/is_there_room_for_some_canadians/,Is there room for some Canadians?,/r/escondido/comments/pb5igd/is_there_room_for_some_canadians/haen3bp/,2,r/escondido,0,2

"I live in Escondido and can recommend it!  We are sort of the happy medium between San Diego and Temecula, although for the most part we have everything we need here in our own city and I don't really need to leave the area for much except the airport or the beach.  Which is important to note, that we are not close to the ocean over here, so the weather is hotter, and drier, and less foggy, than homes by the beach.  But we also get more real estate for our money than living at the beach, so it's a good trade-off.

Escondido has a mix of housing, and neighborhoods, from manufactured home parks to multi-million dollar estates, historic homes to new construction, and everything in between.  You'll generally find that the city center is older, with smaller homes, smaller yards, and lower price points, while the outer edges of town have more open space and larger properties.  But I wouldn't say that any part of the city is all good, or all bad - you just have to decide for yourself what appeals to you.

You can use [GreatSchools.org](https://GreatSchools.org) to research the schools near any given address, and [CrimeMapping.com](https://CrimeMapping.com) for criminal activity.  But most of the time you need only look up and down the street at the neighboring homes to get a feel for whether this is a good or bad area and whether you'd enjoy living here.

It really depends where you live in Escondido. Some of the neighborhoods have gangs. Mostly low income hoods. But I have lived here 25 years. Not a single issue in all that time. I recommend the western part of Escondido. I love it here. My only complaint is that it gets a little hot in August.

"Escondido has a lot of beautiful areas for hiking right on the outskirts of town, we are quite lucky in that aspect. I have a toddler and there is a lot to do between the SD Zoo Safari Park, playing and walking around at Felicita County Park, and the city parks scattered throughout the city. There are also lots of sports/dance classes, library activities, & the SD Discovery Museum, though I can't vouch for them because my kid is too young to have participated in anything prior to March '20 & is so mask-averse that I haven't been comfortable signing him up for anything. 

As for crime, I live in an area no one here has recommended near the center of town that used to be known for crime and have seen nothing except the occasional tagging by teenagers. I'm happy where I live with the proximity to biking, hiking, and the train out to the beach. You can also stop in Vista for a pint at Belching Beaver on the way back from the beach and then hop back on! 

My partner teaches in a neighboring city's public school district that is well-reputed and we still intend to send our toddler to our assigned public school when he's old enough. Escondido schools are good and both the K-8 and HS districts have a lot of really great and passionate teachers. The teachers' unions in this area are strong and fight to protect their wages, how time is spent, and their students, so if you are in education in this area you'll be well served by their support.",t2_3cnm28qy,typicaltear,0,1629899642.0,0,t1_haajndu,haajndu,True,uncle___jesse,t3_pb5igd,https://www.reddit.com/r/escondido/comments/pb5igd/is_there_room_for_some_canadians/,Is there room for some Canadians?,/r/escondido/comments/pb5igd/is_there_room_for_some_canadians/haajndu/,3,r/escondido,0,3
"Crime is about the same as other parts of the county. Lots of crimes of opportunity- people leaving valuables in their cars, package theft, etc.

"Hi 👋 yea Escondido is a great place for kids. We have multiple Lakes with fun activities. You can Google the CCAE or California Center of the Arts. It’s down town near to city hall they have loads of kid programs and a small art museum and loads of theater shows all the time. Also in that park is a working black smiths shop that teaches classes ( depending on age ) We also have the Safari Park It’s an extension of the World famous San Diego Zoo. - On to the bad stuff. Escondido home wise is good as it can be with the market, it’s a little lower price then San Diego non County. There is a element of crime here as there is everywhere. Escondido has its problems not gonna fluff over that but I still consider it a safe place to live. Most of the crime is generally in specific pockets or is the B&E type in the “rich”parts of town. It’s all relative. If you buy a home and want a quite area I would look off Bear Valley and San Pasquale or near Lake Hodges is nice - It’s just enough out of town that there isn’t any issues but close enough to have it all in a 10 min drive.

"hi! i was born in escondido and have lived here my whole life. in my opinion: there are occasional news stories that crop up about crime in escondido (i joke that if there’s a post about a bad thing on r/sandiego, it’s usually something that transpired in escondido lol) but never ever anything where i’ve felt unsafe or like it’s a violent/dangerous community. i’ve also had great experiences at the public schools in escondido (not GREAT like 11/10, but nice, safe, memorable, and fun) and i know this is the case for the majority of schools, maybe excluding like the very lowest rated ones. lots of stuff for kids as well, i remember taking classes at the public library as well as (what used to be) the east valley branch library, now the community center. there’s some dance studios as well. escondido is really nice in my opinion, quite a bit to do, lots of hikes and parks. a big and diverse community! rancho bernardo and poway are also very nice, a little more suburban/rural/housing-focused than escondido, but they are closer to san diego as well. lmk if you have any more specific questions! 💫 edited to add: escondido is one of the slightly more conservative parts of the county, probably more blue than red overall but there is still a vocal minority. not a good or bad thing, but maybe relevant info to you!",t2_1duipb6h,paperbackpaige,0,1629874638.0,0,t1_ha9izod,ha9izod,True,uncle___jesse,t3_pb5igd,https://www.reddit.com/r/escondido/comments/pb5igd/is_there_room_for_some_canadians/,Is there room for some Canadians?,/r/escondido/comments/pb5igd/is_there_room_for_some_canadians/ha9izod/,12,r/escondido,0,12

If you look at the statue of a woman sitting on the bench on grand ave, if you look into her bag you can see part of a nose.

Also on grand, or on one of the side streets there is a very small house completely boarded up seeming like it was misplaced.
