"Shin Chon or chosun  Hwaro


Chosun Hwaro is newer 

Shin Chon is an old establishment that‚Äôs been around nearly two decades

JongKak in baltimore is a unique experience because it‚Äôs charcoal Korean bbq (go in a smaller group like 4 or less).


Honey Pig would only be recommended if it‚Äôs someone‚Äôs first time into Korean bbq or it‚Äôs a late night drunk time.

Iron Age is just ayce and I personally think it‚Äôs not worth it.

Annandale / Centreville VA has great AYCE Korean bbq that‚Äôs better than Ironage which in my order are: So, Kogiya, Oedagib. The rest imo aren‚Äôt worth it. 

Imo, my favorite Korean BBQ (in the area, not country wide) is Meokja Meokja in VA.

"Road projects typically work as follows

9 months to a year before work actually starts they set up some cones and lower the speed limit and double the fines calling it a Construction zone.

Then from the 1 year to 3 year mark 2 guys work while 6 guys stand around and watch for about 4 or 5 hours a day.

Then they all take a break for 6 months to a year and go fuck up some other road and disrupt traffic for a few months. 

Then they come back and work for another few months but cut the work force down to one guy driving heavy equipment around while 4 guys congregate around the back of a pick up with the tail gate lowered with hard hats on to protect them from the falling debris that comes with doing road work

Whenever they get done, they leave all the cones and junk there for another year to rack up more double fines.

"Funny story: I was with a friend while we drove through some part of West Baltimore I've never been to before and haven't been to since. No idea where to this day. They were a bigger dude, ex-marine, in their thirties and I was probably 24. They say they want to buy a water, so they see a gas station and pull in. As he does, all these fucking kids coming sprinting out of the wood work and run up to the car yelling "" pink tops, yo! Pink tops!"" I already had my window down and I couldn't just roll that shit up. I just said no I'm good and they walked off looking really disappointed. My friend got out of the car and tried to go into the mini Mart that was clearly operational and open and this dude hanging by the door just put his hand over the door and stopped my friend. I hear the dude ask him where he thinks he's going and my friend says to get water. The dude literally just snaps his fingers and this kid comes running around the corner with a big cooler. Dude pulls out a water, asks my friend for a dollar, and then we all amicably part ways. 

So these dudes just took over this mini Mart and were beating this guy to his own customers. Real weird times.

Anyway, I had to leave Baltimore for work, but I got offered crack more times than I can count when I lived there.

Is your home a brand new renovation? I do know someone who paid 420k in September of 2015 and their house was assessed prior to rehab for 200k and they were in the 2015-2016 tax year. When the 2016-2017 tax bill came the following July the bill doubled/was assessed closer to the purchase price and the homestead credit didn‚Äôt protect them. You have to live in the house for a full tax year before the homestead kicks in and new construction/renovation seems to be something the city tracks through building permits so it is possible your 2022/2023 bill will be higher.

"> nothing too surprising

Nothing to say besides the obvious - city's gotta work on the crime, here are all the initiatives and funding he's gotten for that, here are other successes of the administration, here's some pomp and circumstance, here are some local kids, here's a local clergyperson to do an uplifting prayer, the usual.  

-

I go back to what Harrison said during his listening tour on his way to becoming police commissioner prior to the mayor taking office: if nobody knows what you're doing, you've got to do a better job at letting people know. He phrased it better than that but I'm too lazy to go into my old posts on this sub detailing Harrison's visits to each part of the city, what questions Harrison answered, topics he covered, and what statements he made.  The mayor has done a lot, but aside from the people who talk about this stuff like its sports - ""That world class athlete who is #3 all time in scoring in the history of the sport - they SUCK"", there really do seem to be some otherwise reasonable people that literally think the man has sat in his office and checked out his taper the entire time he's been mayor. The mind boggles.  But that's on the administration. It's like someone at a job who has been the best of the best who then meets someone else in the organization who will now be managing them.  If all that person knows is a previous status of your division and the current status and you don't tell them you led the team in sales or manufactured the most widgets in the history of the market, they don't know, and don't feel like they are obligated to learn.  

People feel like they haven't heard of anything through passive means, so the mayor legitimately must not be doing anything besides showing up at crime scenes to wag his finger at the suspects and future suspects.  If somebody's a teenager or like just turned 21 I get that mindset cause you mostly just think about yourself anyway. But there are some adults, with children themselves, who say this stuff, and like I said, the mind boggles.

"My understanding is that it limits the amount of increased property tax you owe to 4% annually. So if your house is currently appraised at 100k and the next appraisal finds that it is worth 200k, you only pay tax on 104k, even though the appraisal will still show that it is worth 200k. So it will save you major money and is very worthwhile to send in your application. 
It limits the tax liability not the appraisal value, but you can also appeal a new appraisal within a certain time frame, if you feel like it‚Äôs unfair (maybe the appraisal is based on houses that have been fixed up and sold but yours is in bad condition or whatever- I‚Äôm not exactly sure what the process is to be honest).",t2_io26t,ryebot3000,0,1648945593.0,0,t1_i363nv9,i363nv9,True,protomolocular,t3_tux6dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tux6dh/property_tax_and_homestead_credit_question/,Property tax and homestead credit question.,/r/baltimore/comments/tux6dh/property_tax_and_homestead_credit_question/i363nv9/,2,r/baltimore,0,2

"I just listened through the video and took some notes down. Police originally attempted to stop this car when a license plate check indicated the owner had a warrant for their arrest. When they put on their lights to pull the vehicle over, the vehicle sped away. While searching the area for the suspect, they found the car parked on the side of the road. At first the two people in the vehicle ran away, but the driver then doubled back and got back in the car. The officers stopped their cars, got out and we're approaching the vehicle from the front when we see the first bodycam video start. One officer is directly in front of the car when the driver floors it to try and escape, and was possibly struck by the vehicle. He fell to the ground as the car passes him. The other officers began shooting as the driver sped up towards the officer.



I'd like to also remind everyone about Baltimore County PD officer Amy Caprio, who was killed when responding to a burglary in 2018 when the getaway driver struck her with his vehicle.

"Don‚Äôt know how I found your posts but seeing so many people come together to help you and you being able to give an update that you are doing well has brought me a lot of joy. 

The phone blackout thing I can kind of understand (so people are not able to be contacted by dealers, the abusive loved ones they are trying to escape, etc). But expecting people in that situation to have access to $2 a day is strange. 

Maybe their thought process is that when you pay for something you value it more? Oh that reminds me of another story that put a smile on my face... I‚Äôll see if I can find it...

Or that those programs are trying to use their limited resources to help the people who are ready to make major life changes and want to avoid just being used for their beds by people who aren‚Äôt looking to improve their situation. 

(That is actually kind of an interesting thought to me... like for example, if a shelter for those who are trying to get off heroin were to be located down the street from a suboxone clinic, and they provided both $2 and the suboxone to those in the shelter, the ones who returned to the shelter and paid the $2 would be the ones who are serious about getting clean, and would therefore  be the ones who are able to benefit more from specialized services that program provides that a typical shelter may not.)

"For those interested, a very good article ""**The Impact of Black Labor on European Immigration into Baltimore's Oldtown 1790 - 1910,** by D Randall Beirne appeared in the Winter 1988 edition of The Maryland Historical Society Magazine. It gives very good data on Old town as being, by default Baltimore's largest Black neighborhood as well as being home for wave after wave of new poor white immigrants. In my nearly 40 yrs living in the city, Oldtown has been  mismanaged with one after the other grand plan. The only thing which happens, with each new plan, is more buildings are bulldozed. It also explains the changing racial demographics of the city over the decades.

 It irks me to no end that we have all these elite institutions of higher learning, getting mega bucks for research, and we never hear a peep out of the ""elite"" experts.  When problems arise, and fatality for a house collapse, or gun violence, the experts are nowhere to be found to provide educated guidance for the city leadership.

"The limiting factor is going to be access to MARC, not running. You basically have two options for non-car access to MARC - Camden Station (Camden Line) and Penn Station (Penn Line). 

For the Camden Line, look into the south Baltimore Peninsula. Locust Point is going to be the overall nicest and by far the best running, but will also be the furthest away. You can take a bus to somewhat near the Camden Line but unless you are pretty motivated it won't be easily walkable (~2 miles). Locust Point is also close to grocery stores, which is also convenient. Otterbein is the closest to MARC but has the least going on - less restaurants, no grocery store, etc. It's a nice neighborhood but it will make car free life more difficult when you need to get groceries. The most optimal location is probably going to be south of Fort Ave close to Shoppers - then you can have a more reasonable walk to MARC, be right next to groceries, and be a quick run to prime Locust Point running. You could also easily incorporate Riverside and Fed Hill parks into your runs.

I am not as familiar with the Penn Station area to offer an optimal suggestion, but that areas has highlights as well. You'd be able to access Druid Hill Park and the northern part of the JFX trail. Both are more exciting than running around Locust Point, but if safety is your top concern I would rate them slightly less safe. Not unsafe... but the probability of bumping into interesting characters around Locust Point is nearly zero. Generally, the areas within walking distance on the opposite side of 83 from Penn Station have more to offer. Immediately north and east of Penn Station is kind of desolate.

Running clubs are super popular in the warmer months. If you do get a car, my suggestion would be to check out some clubs outside of Baltimore as well. I see gigantic (20-30) groups of people on the Torrey Brown Rail Trail (formerly NCR Trail - still called that sometimes) on weekend mornings. No idea how they organize but it's pretty clear that they are groups and would probably be a neat thing to check out. The trail is great for summer riding and running as it's quite shady. You could also check out the B&A and BWI trails. Plenty of groups on those, although I would say they tend to be more cyclist heavy compared to the aforementioned (but still plenty of runners).

Within the city, I am pretty sure all of the running stores organize runs from their shops.

"I just moved out of Baltimore and was a runner as well. Hampden was an okay option for running, close enough access to Penn Station, and meeting people. 

I was able to run early morning to early evening in Hampden with no issue. Early morning is easier because there is less people and traffic. You can go to Druid Park, run around Homewood, and all over Hampden. I felt safe enough when I ran. 

As far as access to the Marc, Hampden is a quick drive down 83 (no more than 5 minutes) or you take Falls Road down past the Street Car Museum and you avoid 83 altogether while it dumps you right behind the station. That is, if that part of Falls is open yet (it‚Äôs been closed for awhile, opened briefly, then closed back up right when I moved out at the end of February). You can even run down the Jones Falls Trail on Falls and it‚Äôll dump you in Mount Vernon. I even lived in Mount Vernon for a quick second and was able to run around there pretty easily but did limit it to the morning. 

As far as meeting people, Hampden, from my experience, is more families and college-aged to hippies. The Avenue is where it‚Äôs at and there always seems to be people out and about. It‚Äôs pretty nice. 

I recommend Hampden. It‚Äôs calm enough where you can just walk away from the nightlife and have a somewhat suburban feel but still have access to things, even within walking, or running!

By the way, I trained for a half marathon running around Mount Vernon and Hampden. You‚Äôll definitely have access.

I think if they sell bad product they should go to jail. At least Harford county treated the man who died like a person. It feels like Baltimore treats drug users like trash.

I asked the cops if they did any thing after he died. Like to find his family or find who gave him bad dope. They said he was just another bmore junkie. If the cops looked at his phone maybe they could find who gave him bad dope. Then arrest that dealer so more people don‚Äôt die.

"hello! i lived in charles village for 3/4 years at towson, and do not drive. i biked most days, however i'm not an avg cyclist and don't mind the sketchy ride with traffic up greenmount, nor riding in inclement weather. its about a 25' bike ride and entirely uphill, but there's showers on the ground floor of the college of liberal arts, so you won't be too musty for your first class.

there's the [collegetown shuttle](https://baltimorecollegetown.org/shuttle/schedule/), which has stops @ hopkins homewood, and multiple at/in towson - it's really reliable, and i used it when i for whatever couldn't bike, or was going to be staying in towson later than 10p.

there's also 2 public bus lines - the Red and the 55 - they pick up on greenmount and charles streets respectively, and your results may vary between on-time accuracies. the 55 is a longer route, however it doesn't make stops in sketchier parts of the city. the Red drops you off like literally across from Stephens Hall, while the 55 drops you off at West Village. i took these buses in emergencies only, and was always late.

apartments on 33rd or university were the cheapest when i was looking, plus easy access to the shuttle. i recommend housing groups on facebook, or walking around the neighborhood if you can - because there are often ""For Rent"" signs in windows that do not come up online",t2_asxgl,bOhsohard,0,1648833416.0,0,t1_i3097t3,i3097t3,True,Living_Yesterday_480,t3_tttems,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tttems/ideas_on_where_to_live_for_prospective_students/,Ideas on where to live for prospective students at Hopkins AND Towson University?,/r/baltimore/comments/tttems/ideas_on_where_to_live_for_prospective_students/i3097t3/,7,r/baltimore,0,7

"No prob, I also feel the need to express just a small amount of caution though. As with any scene in any city, there are people out there that‚Äôll seek to take advantage of you especially if you happen to be a woman. Last year there was a pretty big exposure of some musicians and workers within the art scene for doing stuff ranging from kinda shitty (cheating, getting into fights etc.) to entirely fucked up (drugging women, rape). 

In my own experience I‚Äôve made a few friends in the art scene as I am mostly a spectator, in that I don‚Äôt create much, I just attend shows and buy stuff if I have the cash. But with all that said, I‚Äôd recommend coming to events with a friend or something, as I would with any city you‚Äôre trying to jump into. There‚Äôs great people and also bad people masquerading as great people. So I‚Äôd come in with a knowledge of what your comfort zone is in regards to other people and know when you wanna bounce if something isn‚Äôt for you.

I also notice you go to JHU, and I‚Äôve been out of there for like 5 years but there was a kinda burgeoning thing going on there before I graduated. Did that die out?

"The tricky thing is, when a municipality subsidides a new entertainment use, they can in fact attract more total spending (i.e. tax revenue) from residents living **outside** that municipality; there by potentially still making it a net-positive from a city's fiscal perspective. 

Even if overall regional spending stays constant, that particular municipality might at the end of the day, gain back their initial level of subsidy with the increased level of tax revenue coming into the city. Especially when you consider all the indirect ways a city makes extra tax revenue from a sports stadium/major venue (people dining/shopping before/after events, parking fees, etc.)

So at the end of the day, it is a type of investment that a municipality can make. But of course, there have been many occasions where this investment is a \*bad\* investment (most football stadiums seemingly), and only a few occasions where this investment may have actually panned out from the city's perspective (Nats Park in DC being one example), where the initial subsidy catalyzes a ton of investment and additional tax revenue.

TLDR: subsidides aren't always a bad idea from a city's perspective, but without the proper analysis, it can often go awry (especially when done for short-term political reasons). Plus, trying to capture spending is a zero-sum game, that is bad from a regional/national POV.",t2_9jl1fn2h,Calm_Stuff907,0,1648822100.0,0,t1_i2zgy4s,i2zgy4s,False,7thtrumpetsoonplease,t3_tthurg,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tthurg/why_do_taxpayers_fund_sports_stadiums/,Why do taxpayers fund sports stadiums?,/r/baltimore/comments/tthurg/why_do_taxpayers_fund_sports_stadiums/i2zgy4s/,2,r/baltimore,0,2

">If you add up all the revenue generated by those teams, it has an impact on the city‚Äôs economy of less than 1%. That means, if all five teams left Chicago, more than 99.9% of the income in Chicago would still be there, according to Michael Leeds, an economics professor at Temple University and the co-author of ""The Economics of Sports.""

">""Both with the landscape and the building, the spacing is out of sync,"" Pavlina Ilieva, UDAAP chair, told Under Armour officials during a nearly two-hour hearing on their schematics. ""The point of an iconic building is to carry a specific shape and design.""

>Thursday's meeting marked the first time Under Armour had presented plans on its proposed campus to UDAAP in six years.

-

> [Neil Jurgens, Under Armour's senior vice president for real estate] said after the meeting the UDAPP presentation was focused on site massing and pedestrian flow.

>""As we stated to the committee, it is our intention to present more detailed design plans in the weeks ahead,"" he said.

>Panel members said they wanted to see more specifics for the building, what it will look like and how it will fit into the overall campus. They told Jergens and architects from Gensler that it was impossible to envision the project without all of those details presented at once.

>""It needs to be a beacon of some kind to get you into the site to define what Under Armour is all about,"" UDAAP member Osborne Anthony said.

>He ended with a bit of encouragement: ""Kudos to you guys.

"There‚Äôs a couple of great books that go into much longer winded explanations, but basically what economics have concluded is that people will spend X amount every month on entertainment, and it doesn‚Äôt necessarily need to be specific entertainment such as professional baseball. So taxpayers funding hundreds of millions for stadium or upgrades isn‚Äôt needed as long as private businesses (bars, theatre‚Äôs, museums, etc) are already providing such services. And instead of putting millions to a stadium, that money can be better spent by cities elsewhere which provide longterm or year round benefits (better infrastructure, schools). 

It‚Äôs not an argument against entertainment (stadiums). It‚Äôs an argument against using public money for it when cities rarely profit from it and could better use money elsewhere.

"Wow! I'm very impressed with your level of insight even more so. I would have thought you were in the system for years. 

I experienced first hand what it's like to go to a school that's overrun with troubled kids. My middle school was that kind of place but this was  during the 90's in DC but the same issues as here in Baltimore.

Imagine going to a school where they set a trashcan on fire in the cafeteria, where kids get jumped with no repercussions.  In fact, if you were a kid in that situation and you got to the office they would just laugh at you. Those kids were so bad the principal got tired of it and quit. 

It was truly rough being in that environment and it really affects how I view things even as an adult over 20 years later.

- ‚ÄúWe specialize in delicious food‚Äù. Umm‚Ä¶.you‚Äôre a restaurant. I‚Äôd hope so. Pick something more descriptive about your place.

- Throwing shade to Redditors in a post is extremely tacky. Welcome to the business world. You‚Äôre going to get criticism. Grow a thicker skin. Seriously. 

- I haven‚Äôt tried the food myself so I can‚Äôt actually give an opinion on the taste, but the photos are very unflattering. The post where you showed the steak and reacted to the ‚Äúgreen‚Äù comment? The steak looks very overdone and the bed of lettuce is very extreme. Even if a customer likes their steak well-done for some god awful reason, the red and pink in a medium-rare steak would add much needed color. The spaghetti and meatball photo has no depth and WAY too much cilantro garnish, same with the spaghetti bolognese. The Linguine photo would be fine with less cilantro and on a slightly side angle because the colors are there but the angle is wrong.",t2_6v7um,ParoxysmAttack,0,1648776894.0,0,t1_i2xf70k,i2xf70k,False,mrdootdootdootdoot,t3_tpxsaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tpxsaj/what_happened_to_135_wine_bar_in_hampden/,What happened to 13.5% wine bar in Hampden?,/r/baltimore/comments/tpxsaj/what_happened_to_135_wine_bar_in_hampden/i2xf70k/,1,r/baltimore,0,1

"It‚Äôs a bit tough because ever since the Ghost Ship thing and some of that moral scare for the Comet Ping Pong Pizzagate stuff, cops have been shutting down house show spaces and shit.

Here‚Äôs my tips:

- if you have Facebook join the DC DIY Show page. It‚Äôs a great resource and not just DC shows but Maryland shows altogether, including Baltimore. 

- follow the Baltimore Showplace list, just Google that and you‚Äôll see some of the smaller shows since they usually have a space name you won‚Äôt recognize or ‚ÄúDM for address‚Äù.

- go to events at the Crown, the Sidebar and the Ottobar. When I was first getting to know everything, the people running shows used to come to shows there sometimes. Might see a poster for something somewhere in those venues. It‚Äôs actually pretty easy to break in and get put in, especially if you do stuff yourself because people generally wanna put on shows together.",t2_az8qr,DistortedAudio,0,1648765151.0,0,t1_i2wooiw,i2wooiw,False,Wooden_Anxiety5426,t3_tt5qea,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/tt5qea/underground_music_scene/,Underground Music Scene?,/r/baltimore/comments/tt5qea/underground_music_scene/i2wooiw/,10,r/baltimore,0,10

That video where he got walked out of the city will be repeated, lol. That said, if one of the two of them does poorer in polls and they agree at a certain point long ahead of July to drop out, maybe it'll matter. There's still nothing saying 2016 would have turned out different had one of them never run in the first place, but with that past as context, it can't help but be brought up again.
