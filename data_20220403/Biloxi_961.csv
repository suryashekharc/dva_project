"Gay guy here born in Biloxi. Quite hostile here in regards to veganism being respected in restaurants, but good karma is a good option to ask the workers there other places. In regards to gay bars, there are three: Just Us (older crowd, lounge vibe), Veaux (eh), and Sipps (social life revolves around this bar, they have so many events and advocacy organizations). In regards to “being more tolerant than the rest of the state”, that is technically true, but the rest of the state is the most conservative and evangelical place in the US. The gulf coast is “tolerant”,  but as someone who has lived in Madrid and New Orleans, it is absolutely not gay friendly. People will be kind to you, but any gender expression beyond the rigid role of “man” will give you the possibility of being openly mocked. I’m not trying to scare you, because it’s actually a quite safe and lovely place to be, just be cognizant in regards to the cultural beliefs of the older people.

"Hey! Bisexual from Gulfport here. Coastal Mississippi is much more tolerant than many other conservative areas. Most towns along the Gulf Coast are, especially Pensacola, FL. Here’s my evidence about Biloxi: I went to St. Patrick Catholic High School in Biloxi, and every Thursday we had Mass at the school. One Thursday, we had a priest who, during his homily, literally said “It’s Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.” I don’t know if he was expecting us to laugh and agree, but the school was so embarrassed they banned him from coming back to do Mass for us. 

Biloxi and the MS Coast in general is relatively safe for our community. 

As for vegan options, I HIGHLY recommend checking out the local Vietnamese restaurants!! There is a small diaspora of Vietnamese in Biloxi and in that area there are incredible authentic Vietnamese restaurants. My favorite one closed a while back, but there are others still around. 

The MS Coast has a charm to it for sure, if you can find the right spots.

"Biloxi and the whole coast is very walkable. The sidewalks along the beach are safe to walk on. Other then that you can walk on Howard in the main Dowtown area of Biloxi.

White Pillars is my favorite restaurant. Sit at the bar. The bartenders there are amazing. They also have the best brunch. It is pricey.


You got most the places I would drink in Biloxi. Also further down there is restaurant row. Sky bar is a great place to enjoy the view. There is even a boardwalk that connects the restaurants in that area.

Casino's are cigar friendly. Most sell cigars. I belive some will give you on while gambling.

"
1. You can walk anywhere around the casinos, Stay south of the tracks and you will be just fine there are plenty of places north of the tracks that are fine too but it's a decent line in the sand for safety. Howard Ave is fine you can walk to parrains/fly llama from the beach and you'll be fine. 

2. Don't know how upscale you are looking for dining but there is a restaurant called white pillars just a few miles west of casino row that is absolutely worth checking out. If you're looking to stay nearer the casinos there is a great spot to grab breakfast called fillup with billups pretty much right across from the Beau Rivage or for brunch check out Patio 44 but expect a wait. There is a fun little place called the greenhouse that might interest you if you're feeling adventurous, but I'll let you discover that for yourself. Just some fun FYI: the waffle house just north of the Beau Rivage is (or was at least) the busiest WH in the country. Most locals will tell you either the treasure bay casino or the boomtown casino is the best just depends who you ask. You mentioned the project lounge so I'm assuming you're aware of their burger/ribeye sandwich but if you are not aware DEFINITELY order one of them, I personally love the ribeye sandwich but people will fight you over which one is best. 

3. All of those spots are great, again I highly recommend the white pillars I'm friends with a bunch of people who work there and they love it there, I love their food and drinks so it's definitely a good place. The sandbar and fat tuedays daquiri bars are good places to grab a daquiri if that's your thing also and you can carry it with you while you are walking to the next bar. 


Ocean Springs is not far to the east and if you are looking for a lively night life on Friday/Saturday you can't beat it.

"Hey there! Good time if year for a visit, weather is just about perfect right now. We have about another month and a half before you're just wet from stepping outside! 

Downtown Biloxi is extremely walkable. Lots of cool little places to check out. Besides the ones you already listed I would check out The Fillin Station (great crawfish in a cool little gas station turned bar from the 50s on the corner of Howard and Main), a couple blocks south on Main is Adventures (great food, nice bar, good service) they are open late and its always a good time, and you have to get breakfast at Fillups and Billups (great cathead biscuits and house made jam).
OH when you go to the Project Lounge (best damn dive bar in the state) you have to get a steak sandwich or a burger, trust me there is something magical going on there. If you feel like getting a daquire go to the Sandbar, Fat Tuesday is ok, but they do it better at the Sandbar.

Also downtown Ocean Springs (Government Street) is a short Uber away and is another cool spot to bar hop and get some great food. My 2 favorite spots over there are Craft Advisory Brewing, and Glory Bound. Always good live music down there on the weekends too. 

As far as places to stay in Biloxi, it's either a Casino or a  motel for the most part. The Golden Nugget tends to be our go to when we want a night away from the house.

"anything north of the bay or west of the base is a safe bet.  Biloxi doesn't have any truly bad neighborhoods but most of the houses in East Biloxi are quite old and many are in desperate need of very costly repairs.

in terms of housing prices, accessibility to schools, groceries, and public transit, I'd probably go for somewhere off debuys rd if I could.  it's close to the beach, you've got a Walmart supercenter and a rouses close by, and there's bus stops in easy walking distance.

if public transit isn't a concern the area just north of popp's ferry bridge has as close to no crime as you'll find anywhere that's not a gated HOA community.  most of the area is families who have lived there for 40+ years, but there are homes for sale every so often when someone dies, kid moves out and they're downsizing, or someone with a rental property gets tired of being a landlord.  access to public transit in the area is poor, but you're about a 5 minute drive to the interstate so it mostly evens out if you have a car.",t2_avxq3,butrejp,0,1646677213.0,0,t1_hzqe594,hzqe594,True,Magical_BlackGirl,t3_t8pl32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biloxi/comments/t8pl32/moving_to_biloxi/,Moving to Biloxi,/r/Biloxi/comments/t8pl32/moving_to_biloxi/hzqe594/,3,r/Biloxi,0,3

"Depends on what you're looking for and what you want your commute to be. Also factoring in insurance costs.

Any area below I-10 is going to have higher insurance rates.

Ocean Springs is always nice. There's also St.Martin to the north which is growing quickly.

You got parts of Biloxi. Most of my friends grew up between Jim Money Rd and Eisenhower off Pass Rd. and it never felt bad.
You got North Biloxi off Popps Ferry Rd. Also okay.

Parts of Gulfport are good, but I'm less familiar with Gport.

D'iberville has grown a lot.

You can always look at Bay St. Louis, Pass Christian, and Long Beach.

https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g43686-Activities-c61-t217-Biloxi_Mississippi.html

Also, highly recommend researching the local restaurants if you catch anything good. Many places (The Blind Tiger for example) will clean and cook your catch for you.

Downtown OS - Bars. Walkable. More of a 'laid back' feel.

Biloxi area by the Hard Rock and Beau Rivage - Good amount of bars, Fly Llama Brewing, and the casinos of course

Bay St.Louis - more of a small beach town feel vs the rest of the coast

You can also rent kayaks or small skifs from places and fish in the Back Bay or out toward deer Island

"I don't think you should have problems getting a rideshare *from* the Casinos. I'd definitely be a bit more cognizant of getting one from where you're staying. It makes sense for them to stay by the Casinos so there may be a small wait for a car when y'all initially leave from where you're staying. 

Granted, I haven't taken a rideshare down there in a few years, but when I last did, we didn't have an issue getting an XL or regular.

For walkable bars and stuff, Ocean Springs and Downtown Biloxi by the Hard Rock and Beau will be your best bets. There's also Bay St.Louis which is very similar to Ocean Springs, but it's on the opposite end of the coast (30-45mins from Biloxi). 

Between downtown Biloxi and Ocean Springs, you have East Biloxi which could be worth a stop as well. Harrah's, Golden Nugget, and The Palace are in this area. You also have Margaritaville; not a casino, it's like a giant Dave and Busters. This is a bit more the 'rougher' part of Biloxi, so not really any other reasons to hit this area. 

You also have the area by Sharkheads in Biloxi. Theres a strip of local restaurants and bars, but not much else. Unless y'all wanna do go karting or something.

Gulfport is the largest city in the area (by land and population) and is not very walking friendly. You do have the bars concentrated between 13th and 14th streets, but unless you want go to the Island View, there's not a lot of variety.

"First and Foremost, be willing to shell out for an Uber or two.

""Unique"" Areas

Downtown Gulfport (i.e. Fishbone Alley area)
Recommend: The Rack House

 Downtown Biloxi (In the shadow of Hard Rock and The Beau). Go up Lameuse until you hit MLK; go East on any street leading up to MLK and you'll find a good place. 
Highly Recommend: Adventures and The Filling Station

Ocean Springs. Walk down Government from Washington. Probably most bars per Capita on the MS Coast.
Highly Recommend: The Office and Govt. Street Grocery

This. As a pale dude of gpt I wholly agree w/it being boredom that reigns. This place is a retirement home with no decent eateries or entertainment. The cost of living is getting worse and the jobs still pay crap. Our state is last in everything and we are the poorest yet somehow find pride in not even covering dentistry on Medicaid for our most impoverished citizens. To start a business here the local political machine will extort you like the mafia in its heyday and then you will not find a place to rent that allows you to pay employees a living wage and still make enough to stay open. Almost every person who is successful here exploits people at least to some degree. Don't do it.

"Generally speaking, most are ok. But certain parts of Biloxi and Gulfport are iffy, primarily the main strip and side streets off hwy 49 in Gulfport at night and around Howard and Division in Biloxi at night. Certain parts of Pass Road at night as well can be iffy. There's not much for the rest of the cities that are whacky. Honestly most violence is pretty low down here. There isn't much racism to speak of as compared to the rest of the state if that was a concern.

"No strip clubs here.

If you are in Ocean Springs Neon Moon is the place to go. It's a late night bar, and usually has quite a few people looking to hook up.

Rooftop also might be a good choice. I honestly have not been there on a Saturday night because of the lines. But it seems like a good place to meet women.


I am not too sure about the rest of the coast. Maybe Mermaids in Biloxi. It's late night bar. And Buoy's in Bay St Louis. 


If you want to have a conversation with woman none of these bars will work, because they are loud af.


Juke Joint might also be a good spot. On Saturday late nights there is usually music.

"Please don’t let the societal dregs color your view of our city - every city has them!

If you haven’t already, visit the Tourism Information Center on the corner of Porter Ave and Beach Blvd (north of the Lighthouse). It includes a free museum and movies of the City’s history as well as a foyer banked with racks for pamphlets of things to do across the MS Coast. There’s something for every budget, ability, and interest to be found there. The staff are wonderful and will be happy to make recommendations to you.

Specifically, I'm making a set of Norse runes for runecasting, a neopagan divination ritual. I'm trying to go as natural as possible, to put a lot of good energy into it. I'll be carving the runes and painting them with a tempura I'll make from eggwash and ochre, and polishing them with a natural beeswax.

"Homes of grace offers no detox at all and no dual diagnoses which most long term addicts could benefit from. If it had the highest recovery rate in the nation I wouldn't personally know so many relapsed participants of that program. That said, it does work for some people.

Places like Bradford health in warrior, AL offer detox on-site and dual diagnosis and their extended 90 day program has an incredible success rate BUT without insurance forget it .. (like 30 grand). The shorter term programs are far less successful and fit along average standards (85% relapse within first year of rehab).

As a once frequent flyer who is now about 5 years clean with a family and a business and a great life I highly recommend MAT drugs (if you're talking about iv opioid addiction longterm). After about a decade of chasing dope I wanted to quit badly but my brain chems so altered there seemed no hope. Methadone saved and salvaged my life but only because I genuinely wanted to stop using.

In all cases that is the reality. If a lot of us are completely honest when whatever program didn't take it was because we didn't completely give in (such as keeping phone numbers tucked away or fb contacts or relationships involving our dope).",t2_ng5au,foulup,0,1638922290.0,0,t1_hnnp6li,hnnp6li,False,[deleted],t3_qmky8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biloxi/comments/qmky8e/detoxinpatient_rehab/,Detox/inpatient rehab,/r/Biloxi/comments/qmky8e/detoxinpatient_rehab/hnnp6li/,1,r/Biloxi,0,1

Go to the casinos to eat and see entertainment. If you do go to gamble bring exactly the amount you plan to lose. Don't bring a penny more and don't bring debit or credit cards with you. The draw of gambling is something you won't understand until you've tried it.

"Island View and Scarlet Pearl have been my goto, with Golden Nugget and Treasure Bay as my runner up.  


Admittedly, I have a soft spot in my heart for the Beau due to my time at the arcade there (back when they actually had DDR), various concerts, and so on; plus that one time I won a slot tournament, got 5K of FP, and walked out of that casino with an even conversion, even after taxes (and my first hand-pay!).   


Lately, both IV and SP have been moneymakers for me, but I play very low-risk (no more than $100). I've gotten multiple progressives or features that double or triple me up, and I tend to call it right there, buffering my initial buy-in for next week. Recently, I nailed a QuickHit progressive for an 8x profit at IV, and also survived a whole shoe at $15/hand playing solo on a blackjack table at GN, so I've been happy with my results.   


Just remember my trick, and what I say to anyone who asks me about my results.

No more than two years. Also expect the government to consider your back pay as a second source of income for that year so don't expect to get a lot of food stamps if any at all. Word of advice spend your back pay on a car or preferably a RV or camper because the only place that'll let you move in is the hood since everyone wants your income 4x what rent is.

"Gemma is a 1.5 yr old pittie who is fully grown at 60 lbs. She is great with small children and other dogs. 
She escaped from her yard after being left unattended, and I found her joyfully trotting around, visiting neighborhood dogs. She showed zero aggression toward any dogs, and when she saw me, ran to immediately for pets. She clearly loves people.
I took her to see if she was chipped, and she was! Unfortunately the owner did not want yet back, no fault of Gemma’s, everything to do with the owners circumstances. 
Gemma is house-trained, great with kids, she did well on her leash with me, and excellent in the car (she just laid down in the back seat quietly). 
When I posted her on Nextdoor looking for the owner, several neighbors recognized her and none of them had anything bad to say about this sweet baby. 
She is currently at the Hancock County Animal Shelter. The staff all know her because she’s such a charmer. She is spayed, vaccinated, and I am sponsoring her adoption fee. 
If you have questions or think Gemma might be a fit for you, please message me or contact the Hancock Co Animal Shelter!

Internet is really in the area you are going to be living in because there are several providers down here but the main ones currently is AT&T and Sparklight (cableone). if you are going to be living in a rural area you have some ADSL plans floating around and coast electric is coming out with their own fiber lines.

"1. A. Go to Ocean Springs right over the Biloxi bridge. Downtown OS is very walkable; lots of stores, restaurants, bars, live music, art, and so much more. B. Go to see the Shuckers play. Minor league team but always fun. C. Walk on sail on the schooner and check out the maritime museum that owns the Biloxi schooner. Bonus: burgers from the Project Lounge, divey dark bar with great burgers.

2. Half shell has really good oysters. You can definitely watch the game from the bar. Heck there is a half shell at the hard Rock. You can bet on the game then watch the game while eating oysters at the casino. Also Adventures, lots of TV's.

3. Casinos are okay. The Beau Rivage is very pretty. I suggest taking a walk through the atrium. The pools at the Hard Rock and Golden Nugget are open to the public for a fee.

4.  Fairhope. It's like ocean Springs but fancier, but they do not allow open containers. It's really pretty, lots of restaurants, art, stores, and a couple of bars. Fairhope brewery is there too.

"Royal Jelly tells the story of a high school outcast and bee enthusiast who is taken under the wing of a mysterious mentor, only to find she’s being groomed as a hive’s next queen--sort of Carrie meets The Fly. The idea of Royal Jelly first came to me while an undergrad film student at Southern Miss in 1999. I strayed from filmmaking and started a family, working as a Mississippi public school teacher for over a decade before re-committing to filmmaking as my 40th birthday approached. Over the years, I worked and re-worked the story until finally molding a screenplay I thought was unique enough and that I could shoot for basically the cost of a used car. We shot 16 days--mostly on weekends--stretched over a year. Shooting locations included Gulfport, Biloxi, Diamondhead, St. Martin, and Lucedale. Post-production took an additional 3-4 months, and the movie was picked up for distribution by Uncork’d Entertainment quickly after. The film was shot with a Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6k and Tascam recorder with essentially 1 DP, 1 sound recorder, 1 make-up person, and a revolving group of diversified PAs. You can currently watch Royal Jelly on Amazon, iTunes, Vudu, Xbox, YouTube, Dish Network, DirecTV, iNDEMAND, Vubiquity, and a few other places in the U.S. and Canada.",t2_b98sqyvc,PerijoveOne,0,1631933962.0,0,t1_hdadx58,hdadx58,True,PerijoveOne,t3_pqehen,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biloxi/comments/pqehen/my_indie_horror_film_royal_jelly_shot_on_the/,"My indie horror film, Royal Jelly, shot on the Coast was released this week!",/r/Biloxi/comments/pqehen/my_indie_horror_film_royal_jelly_shot_on_the/hdadx58/,9,r/Biloxi,0,9
