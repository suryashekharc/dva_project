"The challenge you'll have with Bryson City is that it's quite a drive to many areas of the national park. Townsend is an option; it's close to the Tremont and Cades Cove areas, but it will be a drive most everywhere else. If you do consider Townsend, be aware that restaurant options are limited, and many close early (could be an issue if you're out late in the park).

Wears Valley is a possibility but only if you're staying in a cabin, eating meals in, etc. There are no hotels or motels in that area, and there are a just one or two restaurants.

Cosby is going to be cabins or camping with few restaurant options. It's also quite a drive (and through Gatlinburg) to most areas of the park other than the Cosby and Greenbrier areas.

I'm not into all of the tourist stuff of Gatlinburg. I stay at a hotel right by the park entrance. I can still walk to restaurants, etc., at night after a long day in the park, but I don't have to fight the traffic, etc., getting to the park.

"In regards to fishing, Smokemont lies at the intersection of Bradley Fork and the Oconaluftee rivers. Both are great trout streams. The Luftee is known for its big browns, but you can catch brown and rainbow trout in both. There is a trail that runs with Bradley Fork for miles. You can easily combine hiking and fishing for a great day out. At upper elevations of Bradley, you may see some brookies. 

I am a fly fisherman, so unable to offer much insight into fishing with a spinner reel. I will say that learning to fish in GSMNP can be tough. The park does not stock fish. Every fish is wild. As such, they survive by learning very quickly how to avoid predators. Even small shadows, sound, or splashes in the water can be enough to spook the fish.

Hope this helps.",t2_2m84iv8c,sleepytime489,0,1648170649.0,0,t1_i20ap7c,i20ap7c,True,BruenorK,t3_tjao5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/tjao5r/trip_to_smokemont_end_of_this_week_avid_hikers/,"Trip to Smokemont end of this week, avid hikers, and also beginners at fishing.

"There's a three waterfall loop in the Deep Creek area (near Bryson City). The entire hike is less than three miles.

Other great waterfall hikes are all on the TN side - Spruce Flat Falls (Tremont), Abrams Falls (Cades Cove) and Rainbow Falls (Roaring Fork).

For other hikes that fit that category (less than 10 miles RT), I recommend:

\- Charlie's Bunion (Newfound Gap)

\- Little River Trail (Elkmont)

\- Middle Prong Trail (Tremont)

"I would think if you got to Cades Cove by 9:00 - 9:30, you should be fine. Once you reach the Townsend entrance to the park, it's eight miles to the entrance to the loop road.

There are restrooms and a store at the campground.

"OK. I would either do Cades Cove, or I would try another option:

Enter the park at Townsend. Turn left onto Little River Road (turning right goes toward Cades Cove). You'll follow along Little River Road. There will be two waterfalls you can see without hiking. Both will be when the river is along the right side of the road. 

The first you'll come to will be Meigs Falls. There will be a long pulloff on your right with a rock wall. This is where you stop. You can see the falls from the pull-off.

From there, you'll go another two miles or so, and you'll come to The Sinks. You'll see a sign that says ""CONGESTED AREA"" and then there is a parking lot on the right. It's about a 20-yard walk from the parking area to the viewing area for the falls.

Continue on from The Sinks about three miles, and you'll be at the entrance to Metcalf Bottoms picnic area. Turn left and go through the picnic area and across the bridge; this is Wears Cove Gap Road. You'll follow it along all the way out of the park until it dead-ends into Highway 321. Turn right, going toward Pigeon Forge.

You'll go a mile or so, and you'll come to the entrance to the Foothills Parkway. There are some pulloffs with great views along this. You will exit Foothills Parkway at Walland (follow signs for Walland/Townsend). When you get back to 321 off of the Foothills Parkway, turn left on Highway 321, and you'll be back on your way to Knoxville.",t2_pfgngxa,magiccitybhm,0,1647497879.0,0,t1_i0zktjb,i0zktjb,False,[deleted],t3_tg3ao1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/tg3ao1/last_minute_trip_cades_cove_in_march/,Last minute trip- Cades Cove in March?,/r/GSMNP/comments/tg3ao1/last_minute_trip_cades_cove_in_march/i0zktjb/,3,r/GSMNP,0,3

"It won't be ""hours of traffic"" in March, especially on a Friday morning. The traffic jams occur primarily during the summer when they get ""bear Jams.""

It's an 11-mile loop road. If you were to get stuck in traffic, there are two ""short cuts"" (cross roads) to shorten your trip.

There are great views, historic buildings and a chance to see wildlife (this time of year, it's mostly deer and wild turkeys). There's a visitors center about halfway around the loop at the Cable Mill area, where they have a working grist mill and other buildings.

I wouldn't think you'd have to be there incredibly early.

Keeping your food as smell proof and chew resistant as possible - opsaks, rat bags, ursaks, etc. - will go a long way. I’ve always hung my food bag separate from the backpack when possible, and made sure chapstick, deodorant, and all other scented personal items were in my food bag. 

I’ve been hiking and camping in the park for over 10yrs and have never had any issues with animals. And that’s mostly due to good food safety and avoiding popular areas.

"As /u/magiccitybhm said, the Park campgrounds have no showers, so commercial campgrounds are the way to go here. However, that's Memorial Day weekend. You are probably going to have a hard time finding enough campsites. 

On the TN side, you could look at [Townsend](https://exploretownsend.com/). These [campgrounds](https://exploretownsend.com/places-to-stay-townsend-tn/) will give you quick access to the Park and would only be about 40 minutes from Knoxville. But there aren't a lot of restaurants and barely anything touristy to do. (They call it ""the peaceful side of the Smokies"" for a reason.)

Or you could look at [Seviervlle](https://visitsevierville.com/), [Wears Valley](http://visitwearsvalley.com/), [Pigeon Forge](https://www.mypigeonforge.com/), or [Gatlinburg](https://www.gatlinburg.com/). Each is within about an hour of Knoxville and lie along [US 441](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_441) (except for Wears Valley, which is just south and west of Pigeon Forge and lies between PF and Townsend) in [Sevier County, TN](https://www.visitmysmokies.com/) and you'll find more restaurants, all the tourist things to do, and a lot more people; which means a ***lot*** of traffic.

"I did a trip to the smokies last year on Easter weekend. It was April. Night Temps below freezing. Day temps mid 50s. Rivers and creeks were high and very cold. 

Widely varying temps require more gear, so I was pretty heavy. 

Water filters can't freeze, bring them in your sleeping bag or quilt. Batteries don't like the cold. They should be kept above freezing also. Phone, bank, GPS, vape, etc. cold kills batteries. 

I camped with a couple guys my last night that walked in, the direction I was walking out. They told me there were 10 creek crossings that are knee deep in a row. That advice saved me from shoes on and off ten times in a little more than a mile. Walked in my socks through them all and put dry socks on at the end. I guess im trying to say, you might encounter some cold water crossings. 

It was a great trip and I'm sire you'll enjoy it. Check NPS website for closures before you go. Have a few different routes selected. It's beautiful in the Smokies.

You could do the LeConte or Charlie's Bunion/Jump-off for your backpacking trip, then there are a number of great options for day hikes:

\- Whichever you don't do for your backpack hike

\- Abrams Falls (Cades Cove)

"The average high in March is in the low 60's. Higher elevations will be 10-15 degrees cooler than that, so you're looking at highs in the upper areas in the upper 40's/lower 50's.

Lows in March are in the low 30's, so you're talking well below freezing at the higher elevations.

As for routes/loops, you might consider the following:

\- Start at Newfound Gap - hike to Charlie's Bunion and The Jump-Off, then backtrack slightly to the shelter at Icewater Springs. Day 2, take the Boulevard trail to Mt. Leconte (shelter there). Day 3, take Alum Cave Bluffs trail back down. You would need to coordinate a ride from the parking lot at Alum Cave Bluffs back to Newfound Gap (or park at Alum Cave Bluffs and coordinate a ride up to Newfound Gap to start your hike). Also, be aware that LeConte is the highest spot in the national park so you'll catch the brunt of the cold weather in that combined loop. This will give you some of the best views in the park, though.

There are shuttle companies in Gatlinburg.

Dogs are not allowed on trails and in the fields.  However, you can bring your dogs to spots like Newfound Gap and the Luftee Overlook to enjoy the sunrise.  Here is a rule of thumb: if you can drive on it, a leashed dog is okay on it.  So, for example, enjoy walking with your dog along the Little Pigeon River in Greenbrier.  Keep your dog by the side of the road in Cades Cove.

Now, if you want to do some hiking, use the nearby Cherokee and Pisgah forests.  You can bring a leashed dog to Max Patch and that offers remarkable views.

"It is touristy, but you can stay on the park end of town. If you're out in the park all day anyway, what's going on in town is basically irrelevant. It also gives you plenty of options on places to eat after a long day of hiking/park activity.

In doing my general research of where to stay, it seemed like people had strong opinions on Gatlinburg and recommended other places to stay over it because of how touristy it is.

"Your only option when roads close down staying in Maggie Valley would probably be the Deep Creek area. You could also stay in the Gatlinburg area. There are a lot more entrances to trails on that end in the park so while some might close, others might be open. I stayed in Gatlinburg this weekend. They had Little River and 441 shutdown the whole time which was unfortunate because all my planned hikes were off those 2 roads. So I ended up driving over to the Cosby area on Saturday which was open and hiked over there. Greenbrier was also open over the weekend so there was that option.

"Just be aware that 'spring' can still be pretty cold:

[April 5, 2015, near the summit of Mt. LeConte](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yZUdZS7qLpBzzBhaA)

[April 9, 2016 near the summit of Mt. Sterling](https://photos.app.goo.gl/WcadRoJMz2zXmHhQ7)

It can still be quite cold at higher elevations in early May, but by mid-May sub-freezing temps are much less likely.

Regarding Mt. Sterling, I would avoid the upper portion of the Pretty Hollow Gap trail - a 2020 flood scoured the trail bed pretty thoroughly. What used to be one of my favorite trails in the Park is now pretty miserable hiking.

But you could put together a 2 night loop from Cataloochee camping at Laurel Gap shelter and Mt. Sterling (38). Clockwise, it would be Pretty Hollow Gap > Palmer Creek > short road walk > Balsam Mtn. trails to Laurel Gap. Day 2 Balsam Mtn. > Mt. Sterling Ridge trail to Mt. Sterling, Day 3 would be down the Mt. Sterling > Long Bunk > Little Cataloochee (two log cabins and a Church on this trail) > Pretty Hollow Gap trails.

"Based on that, I have two recommendations for you (out of many possible permutations in the park with a loop and a view):

1) Mt. Sterling, as you mention.  Classic loop, tough hike.  Great views from Mt. Sterling, but \*only\* from the fire tower.  You can't see a thing from the ground as it's completely wooded.  You can do it from Big Creek with stays at Walnut Bottom and on Mt Sterling, or you can also setup a base camp at Pretty Hollow in Cataloochee and day hike up to Mt Sterling and back (advantage is a comfy base camp at Pretty Hollow, disadvantage is not camping on Sterling).

2) From Road to Nowhere/Lakeview Dr trailhead hike about 6-6.5 miles to #75 Bear Creek (beautiful little campsite with water).  Day 2 continue up Bear Creek and take a short detour by going left on Welch Ridge trail up to High Rocks for one of the best vistas in the park looking back over Lake Fontana.  Retrace and continue up Welch Ridge Trail -> Jonas Creek Trail -> Forney Creek Trail to campites #70 or #71 for an 11-12 mile day.

There are views along the way and as you progress a few miles you'll likely have the trail to yourself. The Deep Creek area is my favorite in the park. Noland Divide is a steady incline most of the way.  The surface is generally smooth and you'll likely have trail to yourself. It does terminate at the road to Clingmans. I'm not sure if you can cut over to the AT but that section would be better than hiking up the road.,t2_25062a42,deviousrobot,0,1641593587.0,0,t1_hrp4jr1,hrp4jr1,False,HahaNoobMaster,t3_ryb4eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/ryb4eh/clingmans_dome/,Clingmans Dome,/r/GSMNP/comments/ryb4eh/clingmans_dome/hrp4jr1/,2,r/GSMNP,0,2

"I fully respect the right that horse riders have to use the trails but as a hiker only, I definitely try to avoid horse trails as much as possible. They are rutted, muddy, sloshy and occasionally spotted with shit. And getting caught on foot near a train of horses is unnerving, especially as you’ll keep passing/getting passed as the terrain changes. Also, camping with horse riders is annoying as they’ll have way more gear/ footprint. I’ve seen tables set up with cast iron cookware and full kitchen utensils, lawn chairs, big coolers, massive canvas tents, a chainsaw, radios, lights using a car battery and so on. And don’t get me started on the MASSIVE camp fires I’ve seen because they bring in lighter fluid and saws!

That's not accurate.

"To add on to my other reply, here's a good summary of what to expect in late November:

https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/weather.htm

>Winter
>
>Mid-November through February: Winter in the Smokies is generally moderate, but extremes in weather do occur, especially with an increase in elevation. It is not unusual to have warm temperatures in the low elevations and snow in the higher areas. About half the days in the winter have high temperatures of 50 degrees or more. Highs occasionally even reach the 70s. Most nights have lows at or below freezing. But lows of -20°F. are possible at high elevations. In the low elevations, snows of 1"" or more occur 1-5 times a year. Snow falls more frequently in the higher mountains and up to two feet can fall during a storm. January and February are the months when one is most likely to find snow in the mountains.",t2_iv82h,Doiq,0,1635264810.0,0,t1_hi4oxpp,hi4oxpp,False,sestrada0116,t3_qg7dux,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/qg7dux/thanksgiving_week/,Thanksgiving week,/r/GSMNP/comments/qg7dux/thanksgiving_week/hi4oxpp/,2,r/GSMNP,0,2
"It mostly depends on what your plans and expectations are for your trip. I think the Smokies are a wonderful place to visit year round, but there are some things you'll have to deal with in late November that you wouldn't have to deal with over the Summer.

For example, seasonal roads: https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/seasonalroads.htm

Clingsmans, Little Greenbrier Access, and Roaring Fork Mountain will be the only seasonal roads open still so you'll have to plan around the other ones being closed if they were part of your itinerary. US-441 (The road that bisects the park at Newfound Gap) is open year round but closed during periods of heavy snow or inclement weather. Chances are you won't encounter snow or weather bad enough to force a closure in late November but I just want to bring up that it could potentially happen.

Overall, it all just depends on your own personal comfort of dealing with uncertain weather conditions. Late November isn't winter conditions by any means, but they can and do happen - especially in the upper elevations. I think you can still have a wonderful trip out here and experience the beauty of the park. On a plus side, not as many people are in the park that time of year so you'll most likely have a better chance of solitude at the more popular places in the park.",t2_iv82h,Doiq,0,1635264611.0,0,t1_hi4ofuq,hi4ofuq,False,sestrada0116,t3_qg7dux,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/qg7dux/thanksgiving_week/,Thanksgiving week,/r/GSMNP/comments/qg7dux/thanksgiving_week/hi4ofuq/,3,r/GSMNP,0,3

"Fall colors will be long gone sorry.

Weather wise, you're firmly in shoulder season. Could be nice and sunny and in the 50s or 60s in the valley and 15-20 degrees cooler in the higher elevations. Or it could also be snowy and winter like.

If you arrive too late you might not find a spot to park. After that it’s a steep hike up to Greg’s along Wolf Ridge. Yeah, it would only take you between 4-5 hours once on trail (consider parking, getting pack ready and actually starting ). That’s going to push you into arriving at camp around 9-10pm, which this time of year will mean hiking in dark from about 7pm (maybe earlier). Hiking at night in the Smokies is a whole other beast that presents tons of challenges. If you’ve never done it, it’s scary as heck if you are alone. Then you arrive all flustered and have to make camp in the pitch dark which means no fire (hard to find dead wood on Greg’s and it’s often misty and wet).Yeah, you can totally make it but for me it’s dangerous of a position to willingly start myself in.

Since you're arriving late, the source down the Gregory Bald trail toward Sam's Gap is probably safer than trying to find Moore Spring after dark. 

On your way to the AT, fill up at Moore Spring. We hiked Buck Gap to Rich Gap last summer, and I didn't notice any water sources. The next source I'm aware of without going off trail is campsite 113.

Dogs may get into dangerous situations (chasing deer, attacking a bear, falling down a ravine) where the owner feels obligated to ""save"" the dog, resulting in a search and rescue for the rangers of the owners (if not a search and recovery, sadly).

I have seen dogs on the trail where the owners allow them to defecate and then don't pick it up, reasoning, ""Well, a bear shits in the woods . . .""

The national parks are meant to preserve the wilderness and its ecosystem.  Your dog could potentially bring in a parasite that causes harm; likewise, it could pick up something, too.

Finally, there are other people in the park . . . and some do not feel comfortable around dogs.  Humans take precedence.

I am not suggesting that you are not a responsible dog owner.  Others certainly aren't (I saw one couple had a young, untrained GSD running loose in a Cades Cove field) and as the rangers have no way of knowing, every dog is banned from the trails.",t2_3itcd,saricher,0,1628637585.0,0,t1_h8gygcy,h8gygcy,True,LookLikeHankHill,t3_ow3yhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/ow3yhk/dogs_in_park/,Dogs in Park,/r/GSMNP/comments/ow3yhk/dogs_in_park/h8gygcy/,1,r/GSMNP,0,1

"I agree with a lot of what you say here. In the author’s defense, I do think he’s correct in saying the Smokies should remain free. It’s a park for the people, and one of the ways to keep the parks safe and open is to have *more* visitors who usually won’t shell out for park access. Parks need advocates, and the best way to build that base is through not restricting access.

All that said - yea... the parks are overcrowded, which is a good thing (as I explained) and a bad thing (as you explained). The solution shouldn’t be more parking lots - but what is a good solution? Timed entry? Lotteries? The same people who would pay to go are the people who’d enter through those channels.

"That's true for 441 and Little River Road, but that's just a small percentage of the park even though it's right through the middle.  It's still a very convenient route in some cases, but at the time was \*the\* route across the mountains for travelers in that area.  Cade's Cove, Cosby, pretty much all of NC except for the 441 access, etc. would not be covered and could conceivably have fees enacted, especially since they aren't really ""thoroughfares"" to anywhere except the park.

Having said that, it's just not practical for a couple of reasons:

1. Too many access points to police.  Just Fontana Lake by itself would make this a hopeless task.
2. Lawsuits.  The very formal agreement around 441/Little River Rd is just one agreement related to the park.  When all of the communities on the NC side were flooded out to create Fontana Lake the feds agreed to provide access to cemeteries.  This led to ""The Road to Nowhere"" saga and the park taking people across Fontana on pontoon boats every year.

He mentions that the move to charge for parking is “for profit” which is completely false. He also states the cost being $35 for his family to visit the falls IF THEY PARK AT OBER GATLINBURG! He paints this as a money grab only and that is extremely disingenuous as this is only a test period to examine ways to reduce congestion which is a massive threat to the park’s environment. The author then suggests the solution is to develop more of the park by building new lots and building new paved trails, suggesting basically to cut down trees, displace natural habitat and add more congestion.

"I hate to see this, cause I agree with the article author that it's a way to charge an access fee without calling it an access fee. I did Laurel Falls my first time in the park and have no intention of ever going back there, so it doesn't affect me directly, but what if next they start charging to park at Clingman's Dome or Newfound Gap?  If they did that, I'd rather they just charge an entrance fee, because then I could use the National Park annual pass.

"I'd guess that if the Smokies had just a few points of access like, say, Yosemite or Shenandoah, then you'd certainly see an access fee which I would fully support.

Parking at the dam is def safer than big creek. I’d suggest springing for the shuttle. The drive from beginning to end to coordinate two cars is surprisingly long and is a crappy way to begin and end your journey. 

For overnight temperatures, I’d roll with the under quilt. You may need it at the higher altitudes. Otherwise, you should be pretty comfortable at night. I don't remember ever being cold in August while staying the shelters. A summer bag has served me well. 3 season is usually too warm in August. 

On the AT, you don't really need to worry about water sources. The trail was designed to cross year round springs every 4-8 miles. Pretty much every shelter has a year round water source. As a west coast hiker, I had a lot of water anxiety, but it was not an issue in the smokies!

"There is no predicting the weather in the Smokies (or Apps) other than to say it will almost assuredly rain at some point.  The AT through the Smokies is one of the last places in the SE I'd leave my UQ at home as most of it is at the higher elevations in the park and it is usually <70F at night potentially coupled with wind which is where I really start wanting an UQ. 

As you get close to your trip, you can use the [Mountain Weather Clingman's Dome forecast](https://www.mountain-forecast.com/peaks/Clingmans-Dome/forecasts/2025) to start getting an idea of temps at different elevations, as well as potential for rainfall and wind.

As far as I know, every shelter has a spring and there are intermittent springs along the trail.  Even in summer, water \*typically\* isn't an issue in the Smokies (which are a temperate rainforest).

I've never had an issue at the Big Creek Ranger Station with vandalism, but people stealing cats seems to be a trend all over the place.

"The [Smoky Mountains Hiking Club](https://www.smhclub.org/) offers guided off-trail hikes from time to time.

The late Jenny Bennett chronicled her off-trail exploits at [her blog](https://streamsandforests.wordpress.com/), but I would recommend getting experience with maps / compass / altimeter before trying to retrace her steps. 

Bushwhacking can be difficult in the dense vegetation, and it's easy to get lost. Many locations that once featured scenic views are now forest again. A while back I encountered two guys trying to follow abandoned footpaths between Elkmont and the Sugarlands. Even with experience, they had gotten off course.

If you want to get some experience 'off-trail,' the unmarked [Thunderhead Prong manway](https://photos.app.goo.gl/RE8bpMpyMw7hxQyE8) might be a good introduction. It follows an old logging railroad right of way and two abandoned footpaths up to Thunderhead Mountain and Mineral Gap.

To find it, drive to the end of Tremont road and park at the Middle Prong trailhead. Cross the bridge and you'll see a trail sign, with the Middle Prong trail following Lynn Camp Prong upstream to the left of the sign. To the right of the sign you'll see an unmarked, unmaintained footpath following Thunderhead Prong upstream. This path eventually comes to a rather strangely designed footbridge over Thunderhead Prong installed on two old railroad bridge abutments and then, a half mile or so from the trailhead, to smaller stone abutments marking the crossing of Long Branch. 

Beyond Long Branch the paths split and become more difficult to follow, with the railroad continuing up Thunderhead Prong and Sam's Creek, and the trail following Long Branch before climbing Defeat Ridge. I recommend ending your first visit at Long Branch and turning back.

You can see the route on [this topo map](https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3902g.np000173/?r=0.593,0.426,0.106,0.053,0).

"Gatlinburg is great if you're looking for a ""Myrtle Beach of the Mountains"" type experience with a Ripley's Wax Museum and aquarium.  If you're looking for a more traditional National Park experience I'd highly recommend the NC side.

Cataloochee Valley is great for wildlife viewing and historic structures.  I'd put it equivalent to Cades Cove without the insane traffic jam, though it does take a little while to get to due to the approach road (perfectly fine for a 2WD car).  

Bryson City is basically at the Deep Creek and Road to Nowhere trailheads, and depending on the water levels it can be fun to tube Deep Creek, especially if you're going with kids.  Also good trout fishing around Deep Creek, Noland Creek, Forney Creek if you're into fishing.

Def do Charlie’s Bunion! Usually a little busy, but it’s a great trail with a big payoff. Check out the jump off while you’re there. 

Maybe go down to Deep Creek and do an out & back on the Nolan Divide. Big views 3 miles up and the rest of the ridge line is great. Can go swimming in the river when your done!

"The trail with the most gradual elevation gain is Trillium. You’ve also got Grotto Falls, plus if you go on a llama day (Monday, Wednesday, Friday weather permitting) you can see the supply llamas. It’s also been recently through trail maintenance so it’s in much better shape.  This would be best for the inexperienced. Then take Rainbow Down. You’ll have better views on this trail and Rainbow Falls (in my opinion, best falls in the park when it’s flowing at a decent rate).   

Having just hiked up and down in April, we did Bullhead down and while the views were breathtaking there was about 1.5 mile stretch of what my wife and I call “ankle breakers”, the trail is covered in the larger rocks that move and roll easy and are hard as heck on your ankles. Especially going down.  I’d stay away from this with inexperienced hikers. 

Trillium up and Rainbow down is also the path that the Lodge itself recommends for the inexperienced hikers looking for one trail up and another down. [Lodge Trail Descriptions](http://www.lecontelodge.com/about/hiking-trails/)

The Brushy Mountain spur is super rocky and trekking poles would help if you chose take it.  Bullhead has some very rocky sections and steep inclines where having trekking poles would be beneficial.   The AT/Boulevard Trail has some root/rocky sections where trekking poles would also help.

Here are a few of highlights:

Newfound Gap Road Paving Project (February 24 - November 30): Visitors traveling on Newfound Gap Road should expect weekday, single-lane closures and traffic delays through June 15 and again from August 16 through September 30 for an 8-mile paving project between Chimneys Picnic Area and Newfound Gap

The Abrams Falls Trail and associated parking areas will be closed May 10, 2021 through November 10, 2021, excluding federal holidays, on Monday mornings at 7:00 a.m. through Thursday evenings at 5:30 p.m. weekly. The trail will be fully open each week on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

Cades Cove Vehicle-Free Wednesdays (May 5 - September 1).  Only non-motorized vehicles will be allowed into the cove. ""e-bikes"" are permitted.

Elkmont Firefly viewing.  During the viewing period, access to Elkmont is restricted after 4:00 p.m. to passenger vehicles with a parking pass, registered campers staying at the Elkmont Campground, or backcountry campers with a valid permit.

"Definitely drive U.S. 441/Newfound Gap Road between Gatlinburg and Cherokee. There are numerous pull-offs with wonderful views. If you're near the Oconaluftee Visitors Center (the Cherokee, NC, entrance to the park) late afternoon/early evening, you may see elk in the fields near the visitors center. On your way back over to the TN side, check out sunset from either Clingman's Dome or Morton Overlook.

As far as hikes, some of my personal favorites are:

Spruce Flat Falls (Tremont)
Middle Prong Trail (Tremont)
Little River Trail (Elkmont)
Andrews Bald (Clingman's Dome)
Kephart Prong Trail (NC side near Smokemont campground)

Another great drive is Little River Road from Sugarlands Visitors Center to the Townsend Wye then continue (road becomes Laurel Creek Road) to Cades Cove.

"So if I understand correctly you were lucky enough to get an Elkmont campground reservation without obsessively refreshing six months ago. (Just so that you know how lucky that is.)

Franklin, NC, is about 2 hours from Elkmont.

It's not all that uncommon that people reserve a campsite in order to get a guaranteed parking place. The $25 fee is the payment for occupying the campsite for the night, you won't be expected to pay more upon arrival. Simply check in at the office on the left when you arrive and park in your campsite. You will receive a slip of paper you're supposed to clip to a low post at your site. Do that, but also remember to take it with you when you leave and put in the box at the exit.

There's no requirement that you set up camping equipment (although we have seen people set up tents, view the fireflies, and then pack up and leave). There's a picnic table, fire ring, and charcoal grill if you want to cook your evening meal.

I suggest going early and becoming familiar with the first few hundred yards of the Little River Trail (the best viewing) while it's still light. There are trails from the campground loops to the trailhead areas that aren't on any maps: for example, there's a trail that follows the Little River from around campsite N7 to the Jakes Creek trail, and from there you can walk to the Little River trailhead.

Everyone should have a red headlamp or red flashlight - you won't have any moonlight on June 3rd (good for viewing, bad for navigating), and white lights aren't allowed. You can make red lenses for flashlights (google 'how to . . . ') or buy inexpensive headlamps at an outdoor store.

There's a building called the Spence Cabin at the Little River trailhead: the area around the narrow trail from the parking lot to the cabin is a great place to immerse yourself inside the fireflies (just find a spot to stand and be still and quiet). 

Another good spot is a few hundred yards upstream along the Little River trail. There will be an obvious trail to the right, follow it around to a small narrow bridge (the Troll Bridge). Just before crossing the trail, turn right and follow the small creek a few yards, and notice the are straight ahead (compass west). There's usually a pretty good sync show here.

The fireflies start slowly around dusk, peak somewhere between 10pm and 11pm, and then diminish. When you're ready to leave, remove that slip of paper and drop it in the brown box at the exit.",t2_8tul0,johnacraft,0,1621725148.0,0,t1_gz3tl37,gz3tl37,True,TheLastKirin,t3_nisxfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/nisxfs/first_time_camping_at_elkmont/,First time camping at Elkmont,/r/GSMNP/comments/nisxfs/first_time_camping_at_elkmont/gz3tl37/,4,r/GSMNP,0,4

"If you want to avoid high traffic areas then avoid the AT, though that would be an easy path to take with two cars to set shuttle.  To avoid crowds, I'd suggest any thing on the NC side and it would be easy to setup a 3-4 day loop on the trails north of Lake Fontana.  You could also set shuttle on Fontana, such as starting at Fontana and hiking to Bryson City.  This is the more remote/difficult part of the park to get to.

I assume you have found the [trail map](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/upload/GSMNP-Map_JULY19-4.pdf) which shows the campsites and trail mileage.  It's hard to go wrong with any loop that meets your mileage criteria.  As an example, consider a loop starting out of the Lakeview Drive/Road to Nowhere trailhead out of Bryson City.  Head over to #75 for night 1, #82 for night 2 (after stopping at High Rocks, one of the best views in the park), #70 or #71 for night 3, and then out.  Or from #82 head up to Siler Bald for a night and do a short stretch on the AT as well as bagging Clingman's Dome, then drop back down for night 4 @ #70 or #71.  The park is your oyster.

The Smokies are a temperate rain forest and over the course of 3-4 days it will rain.  You'll usually see more in the way of afternoon storms in the summer months as opposed to socked in rain days.  Take whatever rain gear you normally would use.  As a hammocker, I always have my tarp and it can be nice to setup temporarily during the day during a rain break.

You will have bugs, enjoy the biodiversity of the park.  If they really bother you consider a head net.  I usually just take picaridin and every spring I treat my hiking clothes and hammock with permethrin.

"> I don't want to overestimate my ability, but I don't want to cruise the bunny slopes, you know?

If one of your goals is to build confidence, I'd suggest starting at Elkmont (near Gatlinburg), and either spend two nights at campsite 24 (exploring the other trails in the area on your second day), or camping one night at 24 and one night at campsite 21.

[Trail Map](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/upload/GSMNP-Map_JULY19-4.pdf)

To get to the campsites, either take the Little River trail or the Jakes Creek > Cucumber Gap trails. Either way you end up at the bridge over the Little River about 2.5 miles from Elkmont. Cross the bridge and the Huskey Gap trail joins the Little River trail. At campsite 24 the Rough Creek trail joins.

Add in the Sugarland Mountain trail, and you can plan a couple of different loops. One would be to camp at campsite 24 the first night, hike up the Rough Creek trail, down the Sugarland Mountain, and take the Huskey Gap trail to campsite 21 the second night, and back to Elkmont the last day.",t2_8tul0,johnacraft,0,1618662781.0,0,t1_guublxk,guublxk,True,StutteringInAcademia,t3_mrt2eh,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/mrt2eh/first_backpacking_trip_without_an_expert_any_site/,First backpacking trip without an expert!

"Sorry, did not get a notification that you posted and just now seeing this.

I would recommend not trying the Gunter Fork trail. It's deep in the park, less used, and less maintained. If water levels are high, there as spots that may be impassable. I don't own a PLB, but I wouldn't be comfortable doing Gunter Fork without a PLB unless I was in a group of several hikers. I'd speculate that the main reason someone hikes the Gunter Fork is to complete the goal of hiking every trail in the Park. And it's much easier to backtrack if you start from the Big Creek junction.

The Camel Gap trail (or just going back up the Low Gap trail) is a better option for the route you've shown, but if you are planning 14-15 miles anyway, personally I'd just stay on the AT and plan to get from Davenport Gap to Tricorner Knob.

If I were planning a trip to drop down the Low Gap trail to 37 and wanted to reconnect to the AT, I think I'd go up the Swallow Fork trail to the Mt. Sterling Ridge trail, then via the Balsam Mountain trail to Tricorner Knob.",t2_8tul0,johnacraft,0,1618660528.0,0,t1_guu676m,guu676m,False,lindabeth,t3_mei31x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/mei31x/looking_for_3day_backpacking_route_2535_miles/,Looking for 3-day backpacking route (25-35 miles) with good wildflower viewing for April/May,/r/GSMNP/comments/mei31x/looking_for_3day_backpacking_route_2535_miles/guu676m/,1,r/GSMNP,0,1

"So, I went on to make my reservation and Cosby Knob is closed due to bear activity. I think I found a solution, diverting from the AT and camping at site 37 to make the last day not so long, as you suggested. I'm also not sure I can swing the short day to 24 at the beginning due to my schedule, so I think I have to just deal with Peck's being a little off the trail.  It's also a bummer because I take it seriously when someone says a site is their favorite!

With the diverted route, I'd bypass Mount Guyot and Cosby Knob, and reconnect at Low Gap (the alternate route also decreases in elevation quite a bit, 5900 to 3100). I was wondering if this route cut out anything that would be a shame to miss and that would make a Tricorner to Davenport day worth it.

Not sure if my [Gaia GPS link](https://www.gaiagps.com/map/?loc=12.1/-83.2487/35.7130&pubLink=RhHeLaAwl5w6Wbhma3p0ltCl&trackId=a5402f37-8f85-4f30-ac6d-13ab38326830) will work or not, but giving it a shot.

As is, it's 52 miles over 4 days:

Day 1: 11 miles (Elk to Mt Collins)

Day 2: 14.2 (Mt Collins to Peck's)

Day 3: 15.5 (Peck's to 37)

Day 4: 11.25 (37 to Davenport)

Edited to add campsite names

Edited to add that I've read more on these alternate trails and it looks like the river crossing near the Gunter Fork trail junction may be an issue, so I'm thinking the better route is southbound, and then it will be easy to divert to the Camel Gap Trail for an extra 1.1 miles if the crossing is not passable.",t2_2u8ek,lindabeth,0,1618028430.0,0,t1_gu0fc7o,gu0fc7o,False,lindabeth,t3_mei31x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/mei31x/looking_for_3day_backpacking_route_2535_miles/,Looking for 3-day backpacking route (25-35 miles) with good wildflower viewing for April/May,/r/GSMNP/comments/mei31x/looking_for_3day_backpacking_route_2535_miles/gu0fc7o/,1,r/GSMNP,0,1

- Roaring Fork Motor Nature Trail
- U.S. 441/Newfound Gap Road between Gatlinburg and Cherokee
- Little River Road between Sugarlands Visitors Center and Townsend
- Cades Cove
- Tremont

Sunrises and sunsets from the parking lot at Clingman's Dome can be spectacular.

"Elkmont is ~2,200 ft., campsite 24 is listed as 2,860 ft. The Little River trail is an old railroad grade, later a road, it's not steep, and about 2 hours hiking time from Elkmont to campsite 24.

The Rough Creek trail is not steep until the last 3/4 miles up to the Sugarland Mountain trail at about 4,400 ft. The ~5 miles of the Sugarland Mountain trail to the AT will bring you to ~6,000 ft.

Hiking south from Davenport Gap is a pretty consistent 750 ft. per mile elevation gain until you reach the Mt. Cammerer side trail (about 5 miles). I repeat myself, but it's either a short day to Cosby Knob, or a rather long one to Tricorner Knob (~16 miles, ~5,000 ft. gross elevation gain / ~4,000 ft. net gain).

If you're planning to sleep IN the shelter, as long as your pack weights are reasonable, I don't think it makes a lot of difference whether you go north or south. If you plan to take advantage of the relaxed rules and tent NEAR the shelter, southbound might be marginally better (there's more room to tent at Tricorner Knob and Icewater Springs than the other shelters).

Where to park and when to shuttle may also impact your choice. Gatlinburg traffic is absolutely awful, 405 at rush hour, gridlock most of the day, it will take you much longer to travel between your endpoints than would seem intuitive.",t2_8tul0,johnacraft,0,1617382978.0,0,t1_gt5p4u6,gt5p4u6,False,lindabeth,t3_mei31x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/mei31x/looking_for_3day_backpacking_route_2535_miles/,Looking for 3-day backpacking route (25-35 miles) with good wildflower viewing for April/May,/r/GSMNP/comments/mei31x/looking_for_3day_backpacking_route_2535_miles/gt5p4u6/,1,r/GSMNP,0,1

"There are tons of permutations of 3-night loops you can make in the Smokies, though it can be hard from just looking at the [trail map](https://www.nps.gov/grsm/planyourvisit/upload/GSMNP-Map_JULY19-4.pdf) to know exactly what you're getting into or what you'll see.  It depends on a lot on your appetite for elevation, views, chill cruising hikes, etc.

One option that would tick a lot of boxes, but would be a tough uphill, would be a loop from the Lake View Drive trailhead (aka Road to Nowhere) up a trail to Clingman's dome, highest point in the Smokies, and then come back down another trail to complete your loop. You can use the Forney and Noland Creek trails CW or CCW to do such a loop, and there are lots of campsites along both trails so you can set your distances how you want them (plan on shorter distances going uphill, it's a climb).

You could also do a loop out of Fontana, head up the AT to Mollie's Ridge or Spence Field shelters and then use either Eagle Creek or Jenkins Ridge/Hazel Creek to start heading back.

"Phew.  I think it's a tossup.  I photograph a lot of wedding proposals and yesterday I was out in Cades . . . and it wasn't bad at all.  Yes, there were a  good number of people out to enjoy the sun and warmth but nothing like the nightmare that there is in October with traffic.

Cades is hard to bike when there are cars, and the car-free Wednesdays won't start until May 5th.  There are places where you will have to walk your bikes due to the steep grades, both up and down.  A good stretch with that is in the second half of the loop road, so consider that if you have a very tired 6-year-old by that point.  And keep an eye on the weather - check the report ahead of time because it can change rapidly.

I like Cataloochee Valley, a lot, but one of the reasons why it does not get as many visitors is because it is not as easy to reach as Cades Cove.  You have to drive I-40 east to Exit 20 in North Carolina, then you have a 10-mile drive, of which about 7 is unpaved dirt.  And bumpy.  I see you will be pulling an RV and yes, horse trailers have made it up to Cataloochee, but even on the paved portions, there are some hairpin turns.  Very sharp hairpin turns.  You need to know your comfort level piloting a 25' RV on this road.  Don't be fooled by the road from Mt. Sterling, NC - it's longer and all unpaved.  Cataloochee is only about 2 miles long and narrow.  That makes it good for elk viewing . . .  provided you are there at dawn or at dusk, because during the day, especially if it is warm, the elk head into the forest.  Also, the front part of the valley is open to traffic but I suspect the back half (it's not a loop like Cades, it's an in and back road) is still closed because they were doing road repair.  However, you can still walk past the point where the road is closed.  

Here is a suggestion: if you choose Cataloochee, plan to be there for elk viewing but combine the trip by getting off the last exit in TN (451 - Waterville) and visit the Big Creek area of the park.  No bike riding, but there is an easy 2-mile trail to see Mouse Creek Fall and if you go a little further beyond, there is a nice bridge across Big Creek and you can get down to the water on the opposite shore for a picnic.  But, as I said, head back to I-40 and Exit 20 to get to Cataloochee.",t2_3itcd,saricher,0,1616864372.0,0,t1_gsh3xux,gsh3xux,True,SteakDinnerBoom,t3_meen8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/meen8x/cataloochee_valley_or_cades_cove/,Cataloochee Valley or Cades Cove,/r/GSMNP/comments/meen8x/cataloochee_valley_or_cades_cove/gsh3xux/,3,r/GSMNP,0,3

"Gatlinburg is a good starting location for a lot of these hikes mentioned but will be super packed around the strip so just be wary of that. Townsend is further away from a lot of these hikes but not terribly and is much quieter than Gatlinburg. 

Of the hikes/destinations mentioned so far, I’d say that Alum and Cades Cove will be the most crowded but the lodge on Mt. Leconte is probably my favorite place in the park and the view from the cliff tops trail right off the lodge is spectacular. I’ve done the rainbow falls down bullhead route and it is beautiful and the burned section is a super unique and sad experience but it is a long day and steep climb up (Note: if you go alum and do cliff tops it will be around 11 miles round trip and over 3k ft in elevation so be prepared for that). 

If you make the drive up to newfound gap I’d also highly recommend Charlie’s Bunion. I agree that Ramsay Cascades is also a great option if you want to see the biggest waterfall in the park. It’s not an easy 8 miles but worth it especially after a big rain. 

Cades cove is beautiful and there’s a high probability of animal sightings but that comes at a price, time and slow traffic. If you are going to do Cades Cove, I would also recommend doing Abrams Falls so you get to see a nice waterfall and the cove for your time spent bit again this is a crowded trail. 

You’ve probably also read about Chimney tops but I personally wouldn’t recommend it. The trail going to the chimney like peaks is closed for rehabilitation after the fire and no matter what people say you shouldn’t go past the orange metal gate saying closed trail and the observation point they’ve built just isn’t the same as the peaks.",t2_11h3az,FachsVolpe,0,1616707572.0,0,t1_gs7y74t,gs7y74t,True,newg33b,t3_md3c4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/md3c4p/first_trip_to_gsmnp_planning_questions/,First trip to GSMNP Planning Questions,/r/GSMNP/comments/md3c4p/first_trip_to_gsmnp_planning_questions/gs7y74t/,2,r/GSMNP,0,2

I'd say the max I've done recently was about 8 miles and 2000' elevation gain on a hike, but I probably could do some more. I've been going to North Georgia here and there recently. Thanks for the info on the alternate routes for Mt LeConte. I'll look into those.

"Former park employee and resident of Gatlinburg here. First of all, for a 5 day trip, just stay in G-burg. The sites you’ve chosen will be crowded, so be prepared for that. I almost want to advise you against Cades Cove, but up too you. You will spend hours of your day in a car if you choose to do Cades. Not sure of your hiking comfort level but LeConte via Alum Cave is a bit difficult, but very worth it. If you’re experienced, get up to LeConte via Rainbow fall then take Bullhead down. This is a long loop but Bullhead is one of the better views due to burn damage. Again only do this if you can hike 15 plus miles in a day. If you don’t want the big loop, just hike up Bullhead and turn around when you’ve had enough views. It won’t be crowded. Additionally, to get away from the crowds drive down the road to the Greenbrier entrance and hike Ramsey Cascades, 8 mile round trip, some awesome old growth and one of the better waterfalls in the park IMO. NFG is cool and if you’re going to drive there make the hike out to Charlie’s Bunion, it’s popular, but hey it’s the smokies. Cammerer is cool, but steep green tunnel to the view and a bit out of the way. Not sure if it’ll be worth it.

"Within the park, I think the two can't-miss sites are: 
1) Clingman's Dome for sunrise or sunset
2) Cades Cove. It's better to be there at or very near sunrise if you're hoping for wildlife spotting. The middle of the day is still pretty, but the bears, deer, etc. are much less active.
3) Everything else!

In general, expect the most popular areas to be crowded. The earlier you can get up in the morning, the more you'll be able to avoid. In the summer, it will be more pleasant doing any hikes in the morning or evening (ending your hike or drive after 6pm) anyway!

If you end up staying on the South side of the park, the Deep Creek area has a few nice waterfalls within reasonable hike. It's very accessible from Bryson City. Cataloochee Valley is a bit of drive from most places you're likely looking to stay, but it is very pretty and should normally be less crowded.

The first day of your trip, stop by one of the main visitor centers (Sugarlands or Oconoluftee) and ask the volunteers what will be nice that week and where you can avoid some crowds. They'll have good suggestions for whatever level of activity you want. There are also plenty of pamphlets, maps, etc. that can be great resources. Many of them are free or $1.

"If you find yourself hiking in a lightening storm, don’t hike too close to your partner. Separate by about 25 feet just in case lightening does strike. Being separated will mean, hopefully, that only one of you gets struck and the other can render first aid. 

Also, if you are on a ridge and the storm becomes too intense you can hunker down by squatting down with only your feet touching the ground. Have as little of you making contact with the ground as possible. Try to position yourself so your not too close to a tree, which is not easy in the smokies haha. Also avoid large boulders or real rocky areas. If you can try to get off the ridge a bit but don’t risk a fall if it’s too steep. 

I’m no expert so there may be better advice out there. These are just the rules me and my hiking buddies follow. I think keeping slightly separated is the most useful.

[Elkmont](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.652945,-83.5809623,18z?hl=en) has about 20 spaces at the [Little River trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6537053,-83.5802155,3a,75y,68.96h,59.5t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s0dMbZxbwF0GMIzn5LleGTQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D0dMbZxbwF0GMIzn5LleGTQ%26cb_client%3Dsearch.revgeo_and_fetch.gps%26w%3D96%26h%3D64%26yaw%3D263.96396%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en), about a dozen more at the Jakes Creek trailhead, and a few more at the Appalachian Clubhouse. There are also a few spaces at the nearby [Elkmont nature trail](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6577664,-83.5807724,3a,75y,112h,98.31t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1skHeymvL8UluOqz8Yc7cY1Q!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DkHeymvL8UluOqz8Yc7cY1Q%26cb_client%3Dsearch.revgeo_and_fetch.gps%26w%3D96%26h%3D64%26yaw%3D43.048492%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en). Worst case, you may have to wait a few minutes for someone to vacate a parking place.

[Smokemont](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.5579207,-83.3120333,18z?hl=en) has hiker parking available year round in the campground along Bradley Fork (marked as 'campground parking 6 & 7' in Google Maps), and a few more spaces at the Bradley Fork trailhead when the entire campground is open during the summer. I have never seen these fill up, and if they do there's 3-4 small parking areas where Smokemont Road meets US441.

With a couple of exceptions,  if there's a trailhead on a paved road, there will be at least a few spaces (like [these](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.663214,-83.5264248,3a,75y,40.31h,88.63t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sVClqcPVmez6lf7Im-h4uEA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DVClqcPVmez6lf7Im-h4uEA%26cb_client%3Dsearch.revgeo_and_fetch.gps%26w%3D96%26h%3D64%26yaw%3D132.28693%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en) on US441 at the Huskey Gap trailhead). The exceptions are trailheads like the [Curry Mountain trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6755054,-83.6463458,3a,75y,278.36h,78.69t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1szzQboK5fvnNpJpHhb2BnzQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DzzQboK5fvnNpJpHhb2BnzQ%26cb_client%3Dsearch.revgeo_and_fetch.gps%26w%3D96%26h%3D64%26yaw%3D178.4669%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en) or the [Bote Mountain trailhead](https://www.google.com/maps/@35.6281312,-83.7255548,3a,75y,91.62h,91.97t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sxv33Apps6EjmGUJjHDNC-w!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en), which are a short road walk (100-200 yds.) from the nearest parking (Metcalf Bottoms picnic area and Schoolhouse Gap trailhead, respectively).

There are also parking spots in pullouts on most roads, so if the trailhead parking is full, you can drop your gear, park your car nearby, and walk back to the trailhead.",t2_8tul0,johnacraft,0,1616179653.0,0,t1_gridpil,gridpil,False,neptunesmom,t3_m7yow0,https://www.reddit.com/r/GSMNP/comments/m7yow0/trails_to_check_out_for_2_beginner_backpackers/,Trails to check out for 2 beginner backpackers?,/r/GSMNP/comments/m7yow0/trails_to_check_out_for_2_beginner_backpackers/gridpil/,2,r/GSMNP,0,2

"One suggestion: the Little River trail from Elkmont to campsite 24 overnight (5 mi.). The next day you can return the same route (or via the Cucumber Gap trail), or take the Rough Creek trail up to the Sugarland Mountain trail, then return to Elkmont via the Huskey Gap and Little River trails (~11 mi.).

Another: take the Bradley Fork and Cabin Flats trails from Smokemont to campsite 49, and return via the same route but take the Smokemont Loop trail for the last leg.
