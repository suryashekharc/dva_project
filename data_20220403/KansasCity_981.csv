"Speaking only as one consumer, I get why an out-of-town management company prefers chain stores because they have a track record they can research and can pay more, but when it comes to a place like Nordstrom, I tend to shop online.

I’d go there not because I have a list of what I need, but because I’m browsing then discover things I want but don’t need. 

Does this line of thought resonate for anyone? Does it make any sense for management companies?

"I literally believed i **cudnt vote**. It wasnt out of a desire not to vote that i didnt try; it was out of the belief that i had no way to prove my identity.

Also all your initial stuff is worded in a very bad way that is rather intersexphobic bcuz by your same logic i shud tell docs what i was assigned at birth. Docs dont need that info, they need to know what organs you got inside you and if you know then they need to know your chromosomes and hormone lvls. That stuff is whats truly important; not what a doc saw at birth and decided to put down cuz of that.

And complainin about laws and bureaucracy preventin me from gettin ID isnt being all everyone is out to grt me; its voicing a legitimate complaint with a bs system that tries to exclude me. If i drove this all wud be far worse for me.

Also plain and simple; ones body makeup doesnt make them ""biologically female"" or ""biologically male""; thats a transphobic and intersexphobic viewing of stuff. If you say AGAB, assigned gender at birth, instd then it aknowledges the fact that the initial assessment was not based on anything other than an outward examination and the opinion of a doctor. And mentionin ones AGAB is just as effective at conveyin all relevant info unless theyre intersex.

And legally i disagree on your claim that such needs to be shared in legal circumstances. If asked ones gender then legally one can and shud answer whatever that is regsrdless of what official docs say bcuz we know our gender better than a form. Like, unless theyre answering questions about what their birth cert or ID (at a later date) says then theyre allowed to state their gender as anything they wish, legally spking.

Also lastly, you didnt need to out your childs birth gender here, but you did anyways. You cudve worded that sentence to say the same without outin what gender your child was assigned at birth. And i can guarantee your child wud prefer you did such in the future; as trans folks in general dont wanna be outed as our assigned genders esp with tbe transphobia it can invite against us. I suggest you seek out trans ran groups that wanna educate parents so you can do even better by your child; i know you wanna be an ally to them and didnt intend harm here.",t2_4nc8i,Shardok,0,1648989150.0,0,t1_i37svhu,i37svhu,False,Belgarath63,t3_tumwi0,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tumwi0/hey_you_in_kc_mo_election_day_is_tuesday_april_5/,HEY YOU IN KC.

The Downtown Council often plays a role in setting the skyline for success, though Hurd said all credit goes to the properties. He said it would be a stretch to call it coordination but they “help to spread the word.” The council’s step-by-step goes kind of like this:

Step 1: A suggestion is received, usually from a city official or member of the downtown council.

Step 2: A “reasonable question” will be passed on to several downtown properties, asking them to light up the sky on a certain occasion.

"So if you are earning in the 19 - 22 per hour range as an assembler in the KC area you are likely in the upper range unless it's a union shop. If it is a union shop then it's a tough call to give up seniority and move somewhere. If it's non union you might find someone that pays for experience - but again I think that's still upper end.

My suggestion is to try and move to a machine operator, welder, or other skilled role. More wage headroom in those.

"He didn't mention Democrats because this whole ""they're the same"" argument is dog/chicken/horse/bull shit.

* Democrats didn't put KS in the hole that it's in.  
* They don't shit on efforts to deal with global warming/climate change to line pockets.  
* They don't promote tax cuts FOR the wealthy paid for by tax increases ON everyone else.  
* They don't shit on building/repairing infrastructure paid for by tax increases on the wealthy.  
* Democrats don't actively worked against our best interest for no reason other than it hurts the other party.  
* Democrats aren't filled with, don't side with, and don't court the worst aspects of the population.  

There is one thing that Republicans don't do . . . They don't establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. (btw - this is the preamble to the constitution)

This is modern Republicanism.

Nixon, for all his flaws, started both OSHA and the EPA. Then after Carter started the Department of Education, Reagan tried to remove it. . . and when he couldn't, he dismantled the funding as part of the payment for his tax cuts for the rich. The other part was paid for by raising taxes on middle class brackets and making servers pay taxes on tips.

Reagan was the pivot to modern Republicanism. It started bad and has only gotten worse.

"If you want to minimize damage, then build a nuclear plant. One good nuclear plant takes 50 acres, can be built locally to the use, and produces power regardless of the weather. The same production would take over 200,000 acres of wind turbines, most likely aren't put where the use is, and only work when the weather is right. For each of 2,000 turbines you need to build you have to do massive amounts of site work to build the site, allow for construction vehicles, and allow for infrastructure.

"One big thing to consider when being budget conscious for wedding dresses is alterations.  They can cost as much as the dress.  The more layers in the skirt or detailing at the hem that would need to be moved all add up. 

I loved Mia’s bridal out in Olathe partially because they did alterations in house so Mia could tell me what would need to be done for any dress I tried on.

I should reiterate that I said I think solar (and the industry/infrastructure around it) can and hopefully will get to a really good point. (And to me is an ideal goal)

Currently the technologies in the their current state nuclear is a really great option for a long time, not only because of the low amount of waste (especially considering recycling nuclear waste and fast-breeder tech), but also the insane efficiency and year round 24/7  reliable output. Not to mention the space efficiency of the the production.

So with proper reading comprehension you should know I'm far from against solar, my main point is the oversimplification and antagonizing of people in support of nuclear as a strong safe current solution is just laughable and reads to me as uninformed.",t2_jedhr,ikeofkc,0,1648881117.0,0,t1_i32xamn,i32xamn,False,RjBass3,t3_tu3ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tu3ucr/mike_thompsons_attacks_on_solar_farms_keeps_ks_in/,Mike Thompsons attacks on solar farms keeps KS in the dark ages.,/r/kansascity/comments/tu3ucr/mike_thompsons_attacks_on_solar_farms_keeps_ks_in/i32xamn/,1,r/kansascity,0,1

"Just responded to comments that I thought were unrealistic. No flattery, or insult, intended. 

You're right, I have a very poor opinion of most homeless people. 
Do you know what I like even less than the professionally homeless? People who, with very limited direct life experience, act like they have all of the answers wrapped up in a neat package. They are the same people who jump on every social bandwagon just to ride it to the sanctimonious high ground. 

What I dislike most of all is people who volunteer other people's money/security/property just to feel like a hero. Want to feel better about yourself? Get some therapy.

And I simply loathe people who are enablers for those who demand more than they've earned. If someone has made poor life choices, they must live with the consequences of those choices. I suspect the enablers have very little in the way of resources to lose.

"Just using my farm as an example, we average 55bushel/acre on an a decent year. For math sake, let's do $10/bushel, which would be an average price for the past 15 years. That would gross $550/acre. If we do 80% of gross for inputs, fees, etc, that would net is $110, so significantly less than the pole for single crop beans, but they're usually planted double crop with wheat. 

Now, if we account for rotational farming and do the same math for corn, 125bushel/acre and $10/bushel average, you get $250/acre net, which is much closer, but still under the average.

But there's variance in production and payments for pole. If you have irrigated land with a center pivot, your yields will be much higher than mine, and you will not be able to run a center pivot with a pole in the way. It also depends on landscape. Flat land farmers have implements up to 120 feet (currently), and the turns required to avoid multiple poles across a field could lead to more than a one acre per pole loss.",t2_4dfp8mg6,petepetep,0,1648867802.0,0,t1_i32crhr,i32crhr,False,RjBass3,t3_tu3ucr,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tu3ucr/mike_thompsons_attacks_on_solar_farms_keeps_ks_in/,Mike Thompsons attacks on solar farms keeps KS in the dark ages.,/r/kansascity/comments/tu3ucr/mike_thompsons_attacks_on_solar_farms_keeps_ks_in/i32crhr/,2,r/kansascity,0,2

"I don't know about your situation, but we have the opposite. We live in MO and my husband worked in KS. I worked in MO.

We reported our full income from the federal form, stating which part was earned in KS.  After that, we filed the MO form, again reporting all income, and then adding the MO-CR (I think) where you declare the taxes paid to KS and receive a credit based on the percentage of income tax you already paid to KS. Whatever the difference between what was paid to KS and what MO charged was the amount my husband owed to MO. Each of us owed something to MO, despite his income all being in KS.

Take into account the massive stores of methane (which is a much more potent but short lived comparatively) in the permafrost of the artic which is being eroded in a cascading manner fed by its own demise.

I agree though they’re not as environmentally feasible at the moment though due to the use of rare metals. Once we can address that though, we’re well on the way to make them more feasible. Battery technologies have had huge strides over the last years too.

"I appreciate your civility, it’s a refreshing change on Reddit!

If I could afford it I’d love to just by some land and set up a permanent thing, honestly. I do what I can afford. But I agree, it is different than permanent encampments what I do specifically.

I’d would disagree with you about my other efforts having an effect on the encampments, however. Let’s for the sake of this argument exclude the mentally ill homeless, because I personally think that’s a separate issue with separate solutions, most homeless people don’t commit crime for fun. They commit crime because they can’t meet their basic needs usually, because they have nothing left a lot of the time.

I’m not trying to push the responsibility onto these businesses, but the article specifically mentioned it being about the public spaces in and around their businesses. Not actual private property. These businesses want to criminalize homeless individuals that they themselves are doing nothing to assist. It’s public property, they’re the public. So in a way I share the same sentiment as you in a bit of a different way, if the businesses aren’t doing anything then they can shut it about how the public is using the public spaces, in my opinion.",t2_ilbf9cc1,TwistedTorso,0,1648843860.0,0,t1_i30yuks,i30yuks,False,journogabe,t3_tt32at,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tt32at/businesses_complained_about_homeless_camps_now/,Businesses complained about homeless camps.

"Fair enough, I’m happy to be proven wrong in this case. You’re a better person than I am for letting  people stay with you during the worst of the snow as well as your other volunteer work/contributions. I don’t mean to minimize the impact you make on others or how kind of an act it is, especially when I don’t do anything close to that, but there is a bit of a difference between letting a few people stay with you until snow melts and letting them permanently set up a camp on your property. Also, while your volunteer work and support  is very kind and helpful it doesn’t really have anything to do with the effects these encampments have on the areas they’re in. You do more for the homeless than a lot of people and even you aren’t willing to open up your place to them permanently… 

My point remains the same regardless; if you’re not offering your property as an alternative location to host a homeless encampment you don’t have any business trying to force the responsibility onto others.",t2_10622,blob,0,1648840462.0,0,t1_i30qnxc,i30qnxc,False,journogabe,t3_tt32at,https://www.reddit.com/r/kansascity/comments/tt32at/businesses_complained_about_homeless_camps_now/,Businesses complained about homeless camps.
