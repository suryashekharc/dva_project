Theres a saying along the lines of drive until you can afford it.

Eventually prices will come down due to an economic crisis, housing bubble burst, changing demographics, global instability, really anything could shift it, because the housing market is more emotional than logical.

And there's supposedly another one opening up opposite The Peace Pipe, although those 'coming soon' signs have been up since before either of those other stores opened, so maybe they've changed their mind now with all the market saturation.

On top of that there's another one being constructed near Circa 1818, in that new strip mall opposite Giant Tiger. And yet another one has leased space in a new strip mall that's about to get constructed by the A&W.

I have to assume that's way more than our town can support, so it'll be interesting to see where we're at in a couple of years.

"Im posting this for anyone who might be searching the same answers. Downtown is... not great. My mother rents downtown and even though im in the area with the worst reputation its pretty laid back and has very little crime. There are a lot of homeless people downtown. Cobourg doesnt have the resources and likely doesnt want to spend money helpin these people so shelters are overwhelmed, addiction and mental health resources are limited, housing is out of reach for most of them. There is a crime map that indicates the type of call that was made to the police and what area it was in. Older people still believe that where i live has the most crime. Where its actually heavily concentrated is downtown.

My mother moved downtown a few years ago and there are people yelling and carrying on in the street. Arguing with themselves. She's had someone spit in the face, her boyfriend was punched in the face for catching some crackhead trying to steal his recycling bin. Im not even joking. A crackhead punched a 65 year old man in the face because he was caught stealing a recycling bin. People have just walked in and stolen their coats. My moms bf had his car broken into for a little flat screen tv he forgot about. You'll always see them rummaging through garbage or having a mental breakdown yelling at people or themselves. They hit the garbage bins like clock work and steal whatever isnt nailed down. One I call ""princess"" gets cracked out and thinks shes the most beautiful woman in the world.

"I know that an officers behaviour can be reviewed by a group who oversees complaints from the public. What that is called or how to do it im not sure... they should have something online. You could call the station. Ultimately the police are going to protect their own and unless you have proof, nothing would happen. You have a video though, so thats promising. People report cops all the time for doing their job... but Cobourg has some real winners. A few years ago i was fleeing my own home trying to get myself and my children away from a DV situation and they arrested me first and asked questions later. They arrested me in front of my kids and i dont even know how long i was in custody for before they let me go. I was having a panic attack and i couldnt even undertand them when they let me go. Just like that. Traumatize my kids and i and just let me go with a ""sorry"" 

 I was driving around like a year ago and I'm not sure why i was having the police follow me. I didnt care. I pulled over and watched them drive by repeatedly.  If they were going to pull me over they needed to get it over with.  So because I  now know from experience that they will arrest people based on the words of somebody who lies compulsively  there are times they make me VERY uncomfortable. That night I did have a panic attack even though I knew I wasn't doing anything wrong. I also wasn't doing anything wrong the day they arrested me IN FRONT OF MY KIDS. So, I had a panic attack that night. I pulled into a parking spot, waited and almost vomited in my car.  The fact that I even exist on their radar sometimes makes me nervous.

JJ's charge $8.25 for a burger and fries, with no drink. Big Boy's charge $9.95 for a burger, fries, and drink. Seems pretty comparable to me.

And BB is actually cheaper if you're really hungry and want an 8 oz burger. Then the pricing is $12.45 at JJ's and $11.95 at Big Boy's, and you still get that drink at BB but not JJ.

And if you want just a burger with no sides, they are $4.35 and $8.49 at JJ's and $5.95 and $7.95 at BB's.

"I moved here from Toronto with my husband 5 years ago and we love it here. It's a great little town and especially before Covid it had so much more to offer. The summer time was great with the beach and downtown area bustling with activity from all of the tourists that come to visit. There were festivals, street parties, local theater and all sorts of other fun activities going on all throughout the year. Hopefully this pandemic draws to a close soon so you get a chance to experience it if you move here. The one issue I would say right now is that the cost of housing has gone way up and the market here is pretty limited so buying may be a challenge. From what I've read in the local paper though there are a few new housing developments that will be in the works in the coming year. Like someone else mentioned the demographics of the town have changed quite a bit in the last few years. Even in the 5 years I've been here I've noticed there are far more young people now than there were before. A lot of young professionals that have moved here for the same reason you are. Again, if hopefully Covid restrictions loosen up in a few months I would say you'll have a lot of opportunity to meet others your age because there are many local clubs and groups in the area.",t2_sxvsoy7,LookAcrossTheWater,0,1642030254.0,0,t1_hsf0ljy,hsf0ljy,True,Sunstreaked,t3_s1v73x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cobourg/comments/s1v73x/considering_a_move_to_cobourg/,Considering a move to Cobourg!,/r/Cobourg/comments/s1v73x/considering_a_move_to_cobourg/hsf0ljy/,2,r/Cobourg,0,2

"Recent transplant from the GTA here, although my partner was born and raised. Can’t really speak much to making friends, but I’d say that there’s definitely much more of a sense of community than I was used to. If you get involved with clubs or politics I would say that that’s definitely a good start. 

As for work, I’ll echo what another poster said re: Venture 13 for a co-working space, and then if you need to be in Toronto once a week you can catch the VIA, or driving into Oshawa to take the GO isn’t bad. As others have said though, a car is almost certainly a necessity for getting around generally. 

As for housing, the area you’re looking at is quite nice in my opinion. I’d say it’s safe as well. One or two blocks west around Division near you might see more homeless people, but for the most part they’re just trying to get by. There’s really nowhere in Cobourg that I’d feel unsafe walking in at all. 

The population skews older, but I think there are more and more young people sticking around these days as it becomes unaffordable to live in the city so things may be changing. There’s a few good places to eat and drink (although far less variety than Toronto), nice coffeeshops, and good access to outdoor activities either downtown at the waterfront, or a short drive North. 

I’d say I’m quite pleased having moved - I’d definitely recommend it.",t2_4z8or,mwardle,0,1642000683.0,0,t1_hscunlp,hscunlp,True,Sunstreaked,t3_s1v73x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cobourg/comments/s1v73x/considering_a_move_to_cobourg/,Considering a move to Cobourg!,/r/Cobourg/comments/s1v73x/considering_a_move_to_cobourg/hscunlp/,3,r/Cobourg,0,3

"Cobourg really does have everything you would need in a small town. Lots of retail, restaurants, pubs, a small mall they are trying to revitalize, a hospital, even a small movie theater. Some of these maybe on the small side and a bit outdated, but if you really want to watch the latest blockbuster at a fancy theater or need bigger and fancier store then Bowmanville and Oshawa are only a half hour drive away. Personally, the town has everything we need.

About 20 minutes north of town we also have the Northumberland forest that is filled with trails where you can go hiking, biking, and even cross country skiing in the winter. Some trails allow motorized vehicles during the summer months for those who are into dirt bikes etc.

We used to live in the GTA and just like you, we moved here when we were in our late 20's, now in our mid 30's. And we have seen some changes since we moved. Being from a bigger city we were used to everything being open all the time, which wasn't the case here, things would close early, and it was next to impossible finding something open during a holiday, but that has changed quite a bit. Another big change is on the age of people, when we first moved here it felt like we were always they youngest people anywhere we went. That has changed quite a bit, the town has expanded a lot and it continues to do so, so our guess is that lot's of young families are moving from the city to here just like we did. 

I would say the price of living is the same as every where else. And haven't really have to deal with any over-priced trades people. Some thing to keep in mind though is that you definitely need a vehicle to get around. The bus system in town isn't the greatest, and besides the Via train, there isn't really a good way to travel to other cities. There are only a handful of cabs and we don't have ride-sharing here yet, so you'll definitely need a vehicle at all times. 

As for the neighborhoods, over the past couple of years we have seen a rise in homelessness and drug use closer to the downtown area. Being from a bigger city it wasn't anything we are not used to seeing or dealing with. It's sad to see, but then again this seems to be a country wide issue. But I would say most of the town's neighborhoods feel very safe. We made friends our age before the pandemic began by joining the MeetUp app and going to different events. It was a great way to meet people.

"I moved here 4 years ago and rented the first year in the King and William Street area. Nice location as we were walking distance to the downtown and the beach and seemed to be a decent area. I've heard about the stuff going on in the James Street area, and yeah hopefully with that place being sold the shady people will disappear for the most part. Overall though I feel like Cobourg is a really safe town and I've really enjoyed living here and plan on staying long term. Hopefully COVID dies down by this summer because the summer months here are great. Lots of festivals and events always going on down by the lake and on King Street. We also have great local theater.

the corner of James and John Street has a somewhat nefarious reputation due to the house on the north west corner. From what I know it is some sort of crack den. Any time I hear the sirens of cop cars I know where they're headed (I live close by). 

I have a friend in that neighborhood and she says there are a few crack heads who tend to try to break into cars and check for open doors to houses too.

"I cleaned my garage back in Spring. I was on the same spot, I don't have a truck and needed a couple bulk items gone. I contacted 1-800-Got Junk. They are expensive but it gets the job done. The quote they gave me was: A minimum charge of $250, which is the same charge as 1/4 of their truck. If you fill 1/2 their truck the price was in the $400's, and if you fill their full truck it was in the $800's. Their truck is medium size, about 30 cubic feet. They pick up all your stuff and they dispose of it too. There are other similar services you can look into.  

A cheaper option would be renting a truck or a van from either Home Depot or UHaul and bringing the stuff to the dump your self.

"There's 2 craft breweries in town. William St Beer is in the strip mall at the corner of Elgin and Burnham. They have some nice beers and you can sit down and enjoy them on site. The other one is Northumberland Hills Brewery and they are on Division North of Elgin. You can sample on site but they don't have a comfy seating area or anything. Nice beers, though.

For food, I like a few places downtown. The Oasis is a little neighborhood place with regular North American style food but they do a good job with it, and the patio is nice. George and Orange is a small plates sharing style place, really yummy. El Camino is a Mexican/tapas place with a nice atmosphere.

It recounts a famous libel suit brought by Canadian general Sir Arthur Currie against a local newspaper critical of his military leadership, and is being performed in the same historic Cobourg courtroom as the 1928 trial.

"The sandcastle festival weekend is a good choice, as the festival itself is fun and there's also a 3\-day sidewalk sale along King street, right in downtown.

[The farmer's market](http://www.cobourgfarmersmarket.org/vendor-listing/) could be a nice way to start the Saturday morning, before heading to the beach for the sandcastles. They have lots more than just vegetables and maple suryp.

At 8:30pm on that Saturday there's also a free movie in the park. No word yet (that I'm aware of) what it'll be, but it's usually something reasonably recent and family friendly. In year's past they've had *Moana* and *Star Wars: The Force Awakens*, so it'll likely be something suitable for lots of age groups and tastes.

Last year they had fireworks over the pier at 10:30pm. Not sure if that'll happen this year too. If you check out [the town's sandcastle festival website](https://experiencecobourg.ca/attractions/sandcastle-festival/) you can see what they had last year, and later this summer they'll update it with this year's schedule of events.

As for outdoorsey and adventurous stuff to do... You can rent stand\-up paddle boards \(and kayaks I think...\) from [The Green Canoe](http://www.greencanoeoutfitters.ca/), and by August [the water park](https://www.northumberlandnews.com/news-story/8362625-two-submissions-received-for-floating-playground-at-cobourg-beach/) will be up and running.

Maybe the website should be like www.reddit.com/r/Cobourg instead of r/Cobourg also I don't think there's really much that can be done to make this sub grow people who are Redditors who came here like me just thinking oh maybe my town has a subreddit so they would already know about the subreddit and people who don't use Reddit might not signup or care to figure the website out. And I love this subreddit and everything but Cobourg is small I don't know if there would be a lot of things to post here about Cobourg anyways. I feel like the number of Redditors on this sub is the average percent there would be expected for a small town if it was Toronto it would be the same percent of the population it's just more people on there subreddit because it's a big city. Not much you can do the low population here. I think a change to improve r/Cobourg is connect the people here already and do a subreddit meet up.,t2_7rabq,SonnyJoon,0,1497978150.0,0,t1_dj5r9ri,dj5r9ri,True,[deleted],t3_6i8wec,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cobourg/comments/6i8wec/suggestions_to_improve_rcobourg/,Suggestions To Improve r/Cobourg,/r/Cobourg/comments/6i8wec/suggestions_to_improve_rcobourg/dj5r9ri/,3,r/Cobourg,0,3

"Personally I'd look close to downtown. Not only because you seem to enjoy the waterfront (I agree, I take morning walks along the beach promenade over to the boardwalk most mornings) but it's nice to be walking distance to stores and restaurants.

I'd definitely have a look at The Manor Towers at 47 Munroe St. They're a pretty affordable pair of apartment buildings with friendly staff, and they're located maybe a 10 minute walk from downtown and across the street from No Frills and a small plaza.

The sidebar also has some links that may be of help. Although some of those sites are more often than not quite empty.

I'll echo what redditcomu said, if you have any particular questions feel free to ask. I also moved here recently (well, a year and a half ago) from North York, and I love this town. I'm very happy to spread the love. :)

"> Do you find there's a decent number of places to go for a casual beer or dinner out? I'm not hitting restaurants 7 days a week, but I do like a few options. A little pizza, maybe some sushi or burritos, you know.

For pizza I'd go to Jim's Pizza, it's a local non-chain place that I quite like. If you prefer chain pizza, there's all the usual suspects... Pizza Pizza, Domino's, Little Ceasar, 2-4-1, Pizza Hut, Boston Pizza...

For sushi there's Golden Chopsticks downtown and Sakura Sushi.

For burritos there's Mucho Burrito, and it's possible El Camino or Poco Camino (they serve Spanish and Mexican) have burritos too... not sure.

As for beers, as SonnyJoon mentioned, there's a number of different bars. For the traditional pub like atmosphere I'd say either Cat and the Fiddle or the Jailhouse Tavern... 92 King is another good one.

As for the dining scene in general, I find there's plenty to choose from. From chains like East Side Marios and Swiss Chalet, to quite a few local mom & pop establishments. You can check Tripadvisor for a big list.

And yeah, the waterfront is one of the reasons I decided to move here. It's really quite nice down there. The marina, the boardwalk and the beach with the adjacent Victoria Park... it's indeed very inviting.

"Well, first I'd like to encourage you to be the change you want to see. Meaning, if you want more questions and discussions, then make an effort to post more question and discussion threads. It's a bit of a chicken and egg thing, if no one is posting then no one will be replying.

Which is entirely why I've been making the kinds of posts I have been making. I've been hoping people would comment about things like new stores (Almost Perfect) or new festivals (Gingerbread House).

I do agree that straight up news stories may not be that interesting, but I guess we're going to have to agree to disagree that posting things like the route of the Santa Clause parade or letting people know of a new store or a new festival constitutes ""news"".

Thinking about it, I suppose there's three kinds of categories that you consider news:

- Strictly news items (like when I posted about the marina)
- Public Service Announcement type posts (like when I posted about Almost Perfect)
- Head's Up type posts (like when I posted a reminder about Tasty Tuesday)

I have no problems stopping making the first kind of news post, with links to news stories people can just read in the paper. But I honestly feel that the second two types of posts are useful, especially the Public Service Announcement type. 

So, in response to your suggestion, I guess I personally^1 will make an effort to:

- Increase my posting of discussion type threads
- Not post any threads which are strictly news
- Reduce ""heads up"" type posts (although I'll still post some, as I think they're useful)

As for trying to increase traffic, feel free to post on /r/Ontario or elsewhere and advertise the subreddit. I don't think anyone would mind that, this is Reddit afterall, a very democratic sort of a place.


I have already requested that /r/Cobourg be listed on /r/Ontario's lists of community subreddits. And I suggested to John Draper that he add a link to the subreddit on his Cobourg Internet site. Both these things have been done.

Come to think of it, I should see about adding a link to us on the Wikipedia page for Cobourg.

Anyway, I hope this wasn't too lengthy. Thanks for your input and I'm glad someone other than I would like to see an increase in traffic. :) Please do post more discussions and questions, and please encourage your friend (and others) to come back and do the same. Hopefully we can get this place going a little more.

"> Besides my posts and besides a post about what's happening with serenity spa the last post that had to do with anything besides news was posted 6 months ago.

Could you clarify what you mean by news and news sites?

Because while I agree there's a fair number of news articles posted, what I'm seeing on the subreddit frontpage right now doesn't at all match what you're describing.

- 6 days ago there's a post about Bowl for Kids' Sake
- 1 month ago there's a link to an article about small Ontario towns
- 1 month ago there's a self post about Savoury Celebrations
- 2 months ago there's a self post about the Cobourg's Youth Entrepreneur Partnership program
- 2 months ago there's a self post about the opening of Almost Perfect
- 3 months ago there's a self post about the Gingerbread House Festival
- 3 months ago there's a link to the Santa Clause Parade route
- 4 months ago there's a link to the Vintage Film Festival website, with a notice that it begins on that day
- 4 months ago there's a self post encouraging people to vote

In addition to those, there's a number of posts that (while they do indeed link to news sites) I feel are more about information than news. Things like the timing of the Christmas Magic lighting ceremony, and the launch of the Canada Summer Jobs program, and the Feel the Love event.

Now, as someone who has made a fair number of posts here, several of which are links to news sites, I can tell you my reasoning for doing so:

When I link to a news site, I try to not post straight up news, although I have on occasion - like when the Marina Expansion was defeated. Usually I link to a news site as a way of telling people of upcoming events or giving information that I think may be of interest.

Stuff like Savoury Celebrations or the Summer Jobs program. 

The hope is, of course, that people who are planning on going to those events or participating in a program or something, will post comments in the thread. That usually doesn't happen, which is too bad.

"For a number of reasons, but I got the feeling that the biggest one was simply that they didn't want more of the harbour to be taken up by boat slips and preferred it the way it looks now.

Money was another issue. The marina didn't have the funds to do the expansion, and so wanted to borrow $2.9 million from the town, to be paid back over 15 years.

Here's a quote from the official anti-expansion website:

> The Cobourg Marina expanded by 32 boat slips in 2014. It now wishes to expand by another 120 slips, this time into the open waters west of the Centre Pier. This expansion will necessitate increased boat storage and parking in the area, will destroy the view and the serenity, and will have a profound, year-round, adverse effect upon all natural aspects of the harbour.

> Since the Marina does not have the money to do this, Town staff are seeking Council approval for a $2.9 Million loan to be paid back over fifteen years. If the Marina cannot cover annual principal and interest payments, Cobourg taxpayers will be on the hook.
This expansion has been staunchly opposed by the Survivor Thrivers dragon–boating club and by the Cobourg Dragon Boat and Canoe Club (both of which have said they will have to close if the expansion takes place), by the Willow Beach Field Naturalists and by The Northumberland Land Trust.

There's a lot of industry here including Weetabix, Westons and Horizon Plastics that are pretty big employers. There used to be a Kraft Foods plant that employed a ton of people but it's been gone for years.

 [**Longshore drift**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longshore%20drift): [](#sfw)

>

>__Longshore drift__ consists of the transportation of [sediments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment) (clay, silt, sand and shingle) along a coast at an angle to the shoreline, which is dependent on prevailing wind direction, [swash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swash) and [backwash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backwash_(geography\)).  This process occurs in the [littoral zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Littoral_zone), and in or close to the [surf zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_zone). The process is also known as __littoral drift__, __longshore current__ or __longshore transport__. 

>Longshore drift is influenced by numerous aspects of the coastal system, with processes that occur within the surf zone largely influencing the [deposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediment) and [erosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erosion) of sediments. Longshore currents can generate oblique breaking waves which result in longshore transport. 

>Longshore drift can generally be defined in terms of the systems within the surf zone as seen in figure 1. This figure shows that sediment transport along the [shore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shore) and surf zone is influenced by the swash (occurs in the direction of prevailing wind), which moves the pebble up the beach at the angle of the waves, and moves the pebble back down the beach due to the influence of [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity).

"Let me preface this by saying that I am only 21, so while we may be different ages (just a guess) I have lived in Cobourg my entire life. I've lived in Toronto the past three years because of school, but am back in Cobourg every weekend or so for work.

What I love about Toronto is that there is always something open, always something to do, and you are close to all the action. You can get food that isn't McDonalds 24 hours a day and go catch a movie later than 7PM (our movie theatre actually just closed in Cobourg). When you live in Toronto it is ridiculously easy and cheap to get to London, Hamilton, and anywhere else connected on the GO Circuit. Toronto is also massive, but still relatively easy to get around because there are so many transit opportunities. It might take you three hours, but at least it will only cost you a three dollar token ;)

Now, Cobourg. As soon as I graduated high school 99% of my friends wanted to get the hell out. They hated it. I didn't understand why. It's only roughly 8KM from end to end, so biking and getting about is a breeze. Public transit is garbage though and if you plan on travelling out of town without a vehicle, your only method of transpo is VIA, or private car. If you live downtown, getting around via foot would be fairly easy, but not too many grocers downtown.

The economy in Cobourg is shit. Independent shops, and restaurants open and close quicker than the newspaper can report. Jobs are tough to come by, and tons of people take the 7AM VIA everyday into Union. There just simply isn't enough people to support a non-big box chain here. A lot of the jobs are in manufacturing, but if you are trading futures, you'll have to commute. Having said that, there is a few shops that have been open for decades that will provide you with small town customer service that you would never see in a city. However Walmart, Can Tire, Home Depot, and a few other great stores are readily available within the town, which is great as well.

It is a summer town. Populations triple from May to September. Waterfront festival, and Ribfest are the only two festivals I can think of that would spark my attention, but we may have different interests. They both do massive amount of traffic and have always been good fun. There are tons of other niche festivals and events throughout the town, and surrounding county.

If you are a fisher, kayaker, or biker you are in heaven. Rice Lake (10min North) is supposed to be the best fishing lake in Ontario. Tons of bike trails through Northumberland forest (10min North) and probably at least a dozen clubs devoted to kayaking.

The average age is 106. It is a seniors town, and to ensure they are re-elected, a lot of the politicians will cater to the seniors. They like to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars to make stone statues, and memorials, and fountains that people don't use. We pay ALOT of people in a lot of public departments to do absolutely nothing but Google what they are going to make for dinner that night (I'm looking at you Tourism.)

My SO is a nurse at the hospital, and from her stories, and my experiences over the years, we have a state of the art hospital. Which is always good to know. We still have to ship folks out for specialty doctors, but in terms of cleanliness and support, we are tier 1.

Not sure if this is of matter, but always good to know. There are two high schools (one just closed down due to enrollment numbers being too low.) One is catholic, one is public. The catholic one is state of the art already, the public one is about to undergo a $2M reno that will make it rival the Starship Enterprise (I think).

Sitting here I can't think of what more to say really. It is the kind of town where everyone knows everyone. The hockey programs are above and beyond, the internet providers are mediocre, and only two or three places have cold beer (I thank you Boston Pizza). I've lived there all my life, and the industry I work in requires me to be in the city, but the hour commute will be worth it. Pardon my french but Cobourg is fucking awesome. Most of the people I met in high school grew up in Cobourg, because their parents grew up in Cobourg. Tons of stories in this small little town (which is also a bad thing haha) 

Be more than happy to provide any more info, or set you up with a few kickass real estate agents who specialize in moving from Toronto to Cobourg, luke [at] dimcomedia.com is my email.
