"I live nearby, and according to my nosy wife... The first time police came a few weeks ago it was due to a disagreement(fight?) between 2 groups? within the church, not sure what the disagreement is about or why police have been there every week since. 

After the original incident police have asked the nearby neighbors if they have any information and people have definitely voiced their displeasure about some incidents in the past. (They have nowhere on their property to sit or gather so they are often sitting on neighbors lawns and front steps, under their trees, and it just seems a tad disrespectful to the neighbors) I should also mentioned Sunday services their drum beats start around 5am, and other nights they go late into the night. They also installed a windchime on top of their church which can be heard throughout the neighborhood. I kind of like it, but I could see people might find it irritating.

"""Other concerns included a lack of green space and parkland, the incompatibility of the existing scale and density of the project and insufficient amenities such as grocery stores in the area.""

Demand for these buildings quite obviously exists, so it seems odd to oppose them on the grounds that the people who want to live here wouldn't have access to a grocery store.

"A number of years ago I was helping a buddy of mine renovate the kitchen in his house which he thought was built in 1932

When we removed a wall we saw a wooden beam with a bunch of signatures on it. We were kind of confused until we also saw written on the beam ""Go Lindy, Go - 5-20-1927""

This was in reference to Charles Lindbergh making the first solo transatlantic flight ever. May 20-21 1927. Long Island, N.Y. to Paris, France 

For those not really familiar with this historic achievement, back in 1927 it was a world wide phenomenal event that would give Lindbergh ""rock star"" fame for the rest of his life. It made news in every corner of the earth.

So, TL;DR ... My buddy's house that he thought was built in 1932, was actually built in 1927, literally while Lindbergh was in the air making his historic flight. And of course back then, with airplanes being relatively new, no one knew whether he was going to make it to Paris, or end up crashing in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Go Lindy, Go !!!

------------------------

> From Wiki :

In the early morning of Friday, May 20, 1927, Lindbergh took off from Roosevelt Field, Long Island. His monoplane was loaded with 450 U.S. gallons (1,704 liters) of fuel that was strained repeatedly to avoid fuel line blockage. The fully loaded aircraft weighed 2.7 tons (2329 kilograms), with takeoff hampered by a muddy, rain-soaked runway. Lindbergh's monoplane was powered by a J-5C Wright Whirlwind radial engine and gained speed very slowly during its 7:52 a.m. takeoff, but cleared telephone lines at the far end of the field ""by about twenty feet [six meters] with a fair reserve of flying speed"".

Over the next 33+1⁄2 hours (*While my buddy's house was being built), Lindbergh and his airplane,  The Spirit of St. Louis,  faced many challenges, which included skimming over storm clouds at 10,000 ft (3,000 m) and wave tops at as low as 10 ft (3.0 m). The aircraft fought icing, flew blind through fog for several hours, and Lindbergh navigated only by dead reckoning (he was not proficient at navigating by the sun and stars and he rejected radio navigation gear as heavy and unreliable). He was fortunate that the winds over the Atlantic cancelled each other out, giving him zero wind drift—and thus accurate navigation during the long flight over featureless ocean. He landed at Le Bourget Aerodrome at 10:22 p.m. on Saturday, May 21. The airfield was not marked on his map and Lindbergh knew only that it was some seven miles northeast of the city; he initially mistook it for some large industrial complex because of the bright lights spreading out in all directions‍—‌in fact the headlights of tens of thousands of spectators' cars caught in ""the largest traffic jam in Paris history"" in their attempt to be present for Lindbergh's landing.


A crowd estimated at 150,000 stormed the field, dragged Lindbergh out of the cockpit, and carried him around above their heads for ""nearly half an hour"". Some damage was done to the Spirit (especially to the fine linen, silver-painted fabric covering on the fuselage) by souvenir hunters before pilot and plane reached the safety of a nearby hangar with the aid of French military fliers, soldiers, and police. Among the crowd were two future Indian prime ministers, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi.

Lindbergh's flight was certified by the National Aeronautic Association based on the readings from a sealed barograph placed in the Spirit",t2_4q1kb,LongoSpeaksTruth,0,1648923387.0,0,t1_i34v9cw,i34v9cw,True,Mjhandy,t3_tunbpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchener/comments/tunbpn/a_sticker_on_a_beam_in_the_basement/,A sticker on a beam in the basement.,/r/kitchener/comments/tunbpn/a_sticker_on_a_beam_in_the_basement/i34v9cw/,18,r/kitchener,0,18

I do know that with the chip/parts shortage, some used cars are really expensive right now (because new cars are very hard to get right now).   I know that the Heffner Used Car dealership is good and honest, but I'm not sure you will hit your price point, unfortunately.   I believe most dealerships will finance, but check the interest rate and the fine print carefully.  

Perhaps try Auto-Trader, but please check on the car's history in accidents, etc.  To get your price, the mileage on the car will likely be already very high.  

If you can possibly take transit at first based on where you live (and/or join a car share service), it may help you learn more about reputable dealers after you live here a bit.

"It was made surplus not because of less children needing/wanting enrichment, but rather successive Bob Rae & Mike Harris governments reallocating gifted/enrichment funding to the ""inclusion"" umbrella (Rae) and the Common Sense Revolution (Harris).  Which meant all the money got allocated to special needs and enrichment kids were given very, very little. At the time, everyone was all about destreaming and inclusion, and for some reason, the same people wanting funding for special needs didn't give a rats ass about kids who were high achievers. Enrichment was seen as elitist, unfair to the others and discriminatory. So over the years it has been quietly folded into other things. Very VERY few programs remain.

Same thing happened province wide. Instead of enrichment, my ""group"" got to 'help' the ESL and kids needing a bit of 'extra' assistance. I was also given extra fun activities like Kindergarten monitoring during lunch and library monitoring. 

Oh oh oh, I was also given ""first choice"" of what subjects/courses I wanted to take in Grade 9, of the very limited selection (again, thanks to Harris).

"I'll admit changing the signs before changing the roads feels like pulling the cart before the horse. But I honestly wished the region would communicate more of what vison zero actually entails and the science and data behind it. If you want a resource with science and data, see if you can borrow ""Walkable City Rules"" as a starting point. (Or even check out a few podcasts/videos by the author)  


>In any modern car the difference in stopping distance from 40km/h vs 30km/h is completely negligible.

Assuming everyone maintains their car, and can afford to do so regularly. (And that older cars are off the roads soon) But that's me being a bit pessimistic and not trusting people.  


>This plan is outdated thinking perpetuated by clueless lawmakers and law enforcement looking for more opportunities to pad their bottom line.  


Three assumptions here:  


1. The WRPS will actually get off their ass to enforce something (Lmao)
2. You expect people will be speeding regularly enough to provide more money for the region 
3. Having more budget to spend on much needed projects is a bad thing for the region (Personally, I don't think having more money to fix the roads and provide alternate transit options is a bad thing)

Though speed cameras would likely be part of enforcement to reduce the reliance on police in the future, and help curb speeding. (See places like in Europe which have enough enforcement cameras that force people to either go the speed limit, or pay fines)  


I think a lot of the remaining issue is just us having a car-centric society.  It takes a long time to get everything you need and you have to drive all over the place to do any sort of shopping (Unless you're lucky to live by everything you need). The price of gas and vehicles is going up, and biking or even walking aren't as fast as driving. (When ideally it should be almost equal for most things)

"So the report says, “You have no suitable accommodations and few financial resources.”

The report did not say where Koehler is being released.
His release comes with a number of conditions including:
* Not to consume alcohol
* Not to consume drugs
* Respect a curfew from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m.
* Follow treatment plan / program to be arranged by parole supervisor

"God this is so incredibly stupid. ""Speed kills"" has been disproved over and over again. Especially at the speeds we're talking about. In any modern car the difference in stopping distance from 40km/h vs 30km/h is completely negligible. This plan is outdated thinking perpetuated by clueless lawmakers and law enforcement looking for more opportunities to pad their bottom line.

For all these people on here applauding this, I challenge you to get in your car and drive at 30km/h. I bet you can't without constantly looking at the speedometer. What's worse, doing 40? or paying less attention to the road to maintain 30? 30km/h is **ridiculously** slow I don't think people are understanding that. I can get on my road bike and overtake you if you're doing 30. How does this make any sense?? 

And the roads going from 50 to 40, that might be an even worse idea. The number of streets posted with 50km/h in the region that should have speed limits of 60 or 70 due to road design are many. Lowering these even further to 40 is downright retarded. No one will abide by that limit because it feels completely unnatural to drive at that speed on streets like Westmount, Bridgeport, Erb, and countless others. How about some actual science and road/traffic analysis to fix this instead of posting artificially low speed limits across the board? 

Also how much money is going to be wasted replacing all these speed limit signs that could be used to improve the design and condition of the many shitty roads in the region?

"Simply put, after living in the region 33 years (minus a year-ish for jail and house arrest up near Midland), Kitchener is the powerhouse. They got the muscle, they get the shit done. And destroy most of their historical heritage in the process. Waterloo is where all the snobby ones live. They got the universities, while Kitchener has Con College. And a federal prison :) it's always being a high vs medium class war between the two. But while Kitchener has been quickly evolvinging and gentrifying, we've been sweeping all the riff raff and hooligans and less desirables into Cambridge. We don't wanna deal with their shit! Cambridge is already 3 cities that we're their own, still dealing with the butthurt that was forced upon them 50 years ago. But... They are becoming their own. They are becoming the people who were pushed out of Kitchener by the people coming from Toronto area. They are becoming their own voice, their own master, their own powerhouse, especially when their building up (or having dumped on them by the other two, however you wanna view it) the industrial lands, while the other two become condo-rama to no end in sight.

"Whoops, you're totally right. I guess I got caught up with how asinine the post was and didn't read my source properly.

I took this as an opportunity to actually look up more info on the topic, and it appears that the ""sweet spot"" for fuel efficiency when driving is between 50-80km/h. 

Nobody is rationally going to argue that we should compromise the safety of our neighbourhoods for fuel efficiency gains, though. If we did this, we might as well remove our air bags and seat belts to save weight to use less gas...

A takeaway from Natural Resources Canada's article on how to improve fuel efficiency when driving \[1\] :

>The best way reduce fuel consumption is to drive less.  
  
Walk or bike to your destination. You’ll use no fuel and have a healthier lifestyle.

Lets make a meaningful impact for our community and foster an environment that is supportive of active transportation. Reducing speeds in neighbourhoods to 30 km/h is a fantastic place to start.

"Typically, I've found that councilors are more receptive if you can provide hard data to back up your argument. Before you reach out to your councilors or whomever, it might be a good idea to perform some research on the topic so that you can have an educated opinion.

For instance, you may want to present an argument centered around how lowering traffic speeds reduces the risks of fatalities. \[1\]

~~You could present data which cites that fuel consumption is worsened at higher speeds, so we should lower limits to help mitigate climate change. \[2\]~~ Please refer to my comment in the thread below. As another user has pointed out, I misread my source on fuel efficiency. However, there are already precedents in the auto industry that value safety above fuel efficiency - these values should be afforded to pedestrians too.

Or maybe you live in a residential area, and you're concerned with the high levels of noise produced by cars. You can argue to council that lowering the speeds of cars will reduce noise. \[3\]

Hopefully you will find these resources useful in ""making your voice heard"" with the city! Best of luck with having your speed limit lowered :)

"It's still delayed. I'd speculate it's due to a lot of things. Obviously the pandemic really disrupted the world and transportation. Then there is the fact that Metrolinx has done fuck all to get all day train service a reality here, so there's hardly any need for a modern train station yet. VIA also only runs 1 train per day (maybe two, if you count a return?). Greyhound shut down all its Canadian operations, so there are also very few intercity bus companies left, so there is even less need for this to be rushed.

It's also largely a financial issue. At some point the Region of Waterloo was attempting to sell the naming rights to the new train station just so they had *some* money to build it. So...it might one day be known as the Google Train Station, Kik Transit Hub, Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada Station etc. Hopefully that never happens, though...lol.

"Things will likely slow down by next year I would imagine.

I work in the trades and we are swamped with work, material costs are through the roof if we can get the material, there is a shortage of material from suppliers everywhere so wait times to get material can sometimes be months.


With the cost of labor going up because of a shortage of workers and having to pay out overtime to get projects done, the cost of material going up because of shortages etc. I can see many people getting priced out of work they want done and holding off on getting anything done. This would lead to a shortage of work in about a year, matetial getting replenished and costs for material and labor both going down because contractors will be scrambling for work. 
Not to mention trades demanding more money because of the rising cost of living.

Many places will end up giving you an absurd number so you leave them alone or you say yes, and they make a huge profit on it.

The other problem is that quoting you now for a job that won't take place for 1-2 years is a fool's errand.  Who knows what pricing will look like in that time.

Depending on what you want done, a lot of the work can be done yourself or you can take on the roll of the contractor and then hire each trade/person for each individual task (can also get guys to do side jobs instead of through an actual company).

"Honestly, you have to be very, very careful with renovation contractors. 

If I were you, I would find a cabinet maker (there are lots locally) and create a drawing with them. You can use that drawing to price out an electrician (which shouldn't be a big job) and a plumber (ditto). You can also connect with a counter top place as well as an appliance store.

A kitchen reno isn't a huge job as the majority of the work has already been done. If your basement is unfinished, the job becomes even easier. 

By sub contracting the job you will also save a lot of money.

"Honestly, I don't know, it depends on the company, a 60k job might be substantial if it's just a small 2-3 man operation.

May I ask which contractors came in to quote you?

If they are a known residential contractor, they are probably being asked to build multiple houses in new developments or an entire apartment building. They probably quote a single house around 150k to 200k, so if they are doing a whole row of houses, you can imagine how much these jobs are worth.

Renovations are tough. 60k is a lot of money for me and you, but construction is a whole different beast.

My best advice is still this: Ask if they would be willing to do it on the side as a cash job. They'd probably do it on weekends, or if they have time off, they would do it then.

For example, I work in commercial construction, and when a small job comes our way, we either ignore it, or estimate with a very large markup.

If we're slow and need to keep our guys busy, sure we'll do the small jobs, but for the most part, it's not worth the headache.

I would suggest finding a way to make it as quick and easy as possible for the contractor, if they feel they can bang it out real quick, they may see it as more enticing.

"You will get all kind of responses but in reality it is not likely to help much for dust build up in the house. It's plain physics, positive air pressure will displace most of the dust particles on it's own over a few hours/days of fan operation. Your existing furnace air filter will take care of most of what is loose in the return vents and in the air. 

Proper duct cleaning will dislodge particles that are not likely to move on their own and will only marginally help for serious allergies and almost no improvement for overall dust accumulation.

The only time it is worth doing is if you had major renovations and the accumulated dust might impact the efficiency for your system. If you get a company that actually takes pictures before and after you can see if there is any value.

The scooter ones bother me because they're often entirely unpedalled - at which point the only way it can be driven is as a motor vehicle, and they usually are driven that way (eg, at higher speeds, accelerating as fast as possible, passing other vehicles/pedestrians more often at high speed, etc)

"There are a whole range of vehicles that aren't safe to ride on many KW streets:

* Conventional bicycle
* Kick scooter
* Self-propelled wheelchair
* Mobility scooter
* Recumbent bicycle
* Cargo bike
* Quadricycle
* Electric hybrid bike
* Electric moped

Because they aren't safe to ride on most streets, what can we do besides allow them to ride on paved trails?

The exact shape and size can vary along with speed and maneuverability, but in the end, many streets are uncomfortable and/or unsafe for these users. I can't imagine trying to draw a line somewhere and forcing a class of users onto an unsafe street.

We all need to be able to share the paths. This means riding at safe speeds and being considerate of other trail users.

FYI, the City of Kitchener uses the phrase ""walking, cycling and rolling"" in the [Cycling and Trails Master Plan](https://www.kitchener.ca/en/strategic-plans-and-projects/cycling-and-trails-master-plan.aspx) to ensure all mobility options are included when it comes to trail infrastructure, to support users of all ages and abilities:

"You are correct, based on the sticker, it is legal to drive on the path. 

Laws are not written for the terms used, when referring to different things, to be interpreted based on how the English language defines it, ie, what we commonly call a ""moped"" is not the same as what the legal system defines a ""moped"" as. This is why laws often start with a bunch of definitions at the beginning of them. You have to read the definitions and pay attention to the details. 

In general, a common delimeter with the legal system and these sorts of ""vehicles"" is the maximum speed it can travel at. It is usually around 20km/h. Anything with a max speed of 20 km/h (or less) falls under many of the same rules as a bicycle, and if you think about it it kind of makes sense. If a bicycle is allowed on this path, and bikes can easily get up to 20 km/h, then other lightweight and powered vehicles are usually allowed as well, so long as they max out at 20 km/h. 

This is all in general, there are plenty of exceptions, and consult your stickers and read the laws if you have doubts.

There are plenty of people here telling you it is not legal, but given what you present here, they are wrong. They are coming from a place of not being comfortable with those sorts of vehicles whizzing past them, which I can respect, and you should, too. So long as you slow down to a respectable speed when passing people no one should give you any grief, and if you get pulled over by a cop be sure to have the sticker (and ideally even some laws printed out) at the ready to show them it is legal.",t2_4iamm,slow_worker,0,1648648559.0,0,t1_i2prbz0,i2prbz0,False,Cityofthevikingdead,t3_trtu8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchener/comments/trtu8h/how_does_everyone_feel_about_electric_mopeds_on/,How does everyone feel about electric mopeds on the paved trails?,/r/kitchener/comments/trtu8h/how_does_everyone_feel_about_electric_mopeds_on/i2prbz0/,3,r/kitchener,0,3

"Depends. I think the distinction needs to be in both form factor and function. 

* OK
   * Shaped like a bicycle/push-scooter
   * Pedal or push assist
* Not OK
   * Shaped like scooter/motorcycle
   * Throttle-style actuation

I think the scooter/motorcycle style ones take up an unfair amount of space and move too fast. Generally when using a pedal-assist bike, it's someone who would normally ride a bike and understands the etiquette of cycling around people. When a silent, motorized vehicle comes out of nowhere there is minimal reaction time for pedestrians or the fast moving vehicle, it can scare animals (dogs, etc.) into reacting negatively and hurting themselves or others. It's just a hazard in general.

"> No amount of time saving is worth the potential liabilities and injuries

Problem is a driver (whether e-bike or cars, SUVs etc) doesn't mind to assume that risk. So long as they aren't on the receiving end of that shtick. Possible why for a while SUVs got bigger and bigger. To the point of being capable of carrying an entire hockey team. Equipment and all. Which is only practical if the peoples driving those trucks utilize for sports. It's a jeep thang? But seems to me like an 'armsrace' of who can have the biggest loudest truck? E-bikes are a poor peoples status symbol?  Also, those pay-as-you-go e-scooters that were popular out in 2019 caused innumerable ER visits. Albeit by the end-users attempting to have ""fun"". /s sorry went off on tangent

What I mean to say is ideally people consider others in their quest to enjoy life? However, in my opinion; society seems to shifting ... maybe not for the greater good?
