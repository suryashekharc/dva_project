"For the first time in my 27 years of life I wholeheartedly care about this process (you can thank that traitor Donald Trump for opening my eyes). I am researching the past policies that Whittier has gone through. My biggest initial shock in terms of history is that there seems to be only one latino mayor elected in the history of this city. Whittier is about 65% Hispanic https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/whittiercitycalifornia (a majority of hispanics are picking white as race after choosing hispanic as ethnicity. A lot of hispanics (me included) do not identify as white (I identify as Mexican, but that's a different debate) but we have to choose due to a change in the way identify info was gathered last decade).  The city needs someone who can identify with the struggles that many 1st-3rd gen latinos experience, especially when it comes to achieving higher education. Some areas where I've lived had duplexes with 3-5 families living in it when the duplex was designed for only 2-3 families. Add in the fact that majority are typically not earning more than $35K-$45K/year in non-secure jobs, resulting in less accessibility too education, sports, clubs, etc. for their families.  These are a snapshot of things that the majority of the latino population in Whittier is enduring. 

In those 27 years I have scene ZERO repairs done on the streets where I first used to live in Whittier. For about a 3-4 mile wide zone there are rundown streets with the divider paint very faded and you almost can't dodge the potholes that have built up over that time. Meanwhile from 2012-2020, in Whittier but at the city border with La Habra, I witnessed street asphalt repairs every damn 6 months it seemed with fresh streets and divider paint to boot. This happened the entirety I lived there before moving back more inward. I now want to understand why it seems as though my City is not taking care of everyone, and leaving some areas in a state of shitshow. 

I am wholeheartedly urging everyone I know to start paying attention. Voting MATTERS.  Above all else though, we must elect those that do not divide us, have the highest of moral and ethical character, and those that put the people in front. Reject those whose only purpose is to use their positions to hold power.",t2_15roql8,eddgreat9,0,1648759511.0,0,t1_i2waeur,i2waeur,True,whittierlocal,t3_tgmsn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/tgmsn5/city_of_whittier_general_municipal_election/,CITY OF WHITTIER GENERAL MUNICIPAL ELECTION MEGATHREAD,/r/Whittier/comments/tgmsn5/city_of_whittier_general_municipal_election/i2waeur/,2,r/Whittier,0,2

"A couple come to mind, Nixon Steakhouse in Uptown is decent. Not the absolute best steak, but  they do a good job and the price is fair.

I personally recommend Clearman’s Steak N’ Stein just across over in Pico Rivera.

"Montebello buses service Whittier better than Whittier buses. They also have a line that goes down to Whittwood mall where there’s a target and discount grocery stores on the southern end of the city.

As to quality - not much. There’s no Wi-Fi as far as I can tell like the buses in Charlotte NC. There’s been issues between the transport union and the line operators which has impacted service. At least I hope that’s why buses have been skipping stops.

There’s plans to extend the Metro into Whittier but who knows when that will happen.

"Everyone here has a Tesla and is fairly higher income.  It probably speaks to why the local working class immediately felt some level of caution or anger at what was happening.  The increase in income will eventually gentrify this entire side of Whittier.

Aside from that - kind of a food Desert.  We end up having to travel to the OC, Rowland or back to SGV for most of our food.  Tacos are great here but aside from that it’s pretty limited in variety.

Stater bros is great, California fish grill/boba/fusion Vietnamese is coming to that same plaza and so is chipotle.

Brewery and an outdoor indie food hall is being built right at the entrance to the groves as well.  Some of us here are a little worried about the possible drunken problems that might happen with the brewery but fingers crossed they manage it well.

"Hey thank you so much for taking out time for my post. Really appreciate it. 
I have been roaming around whittier on weekends and I honestly haven’t faced any issues but i just drive from Irvine to whittier and have lunch roam a bit and go back just to get a feel of the neighborhood.
But good points there and i also live going for a run so will try out the trail too.
And regarding the “unwelcoming” vibe , i do agree to that. Its not so prominent but i have been also looking for posts about groves on fb, reddit and felt the same. Though most of them are welcoming but a few are often sarcastic. 
Most asians and mixed are moving because of affordability and new construction. Irvine , lake forest have blown on house prices to an extent its just too high. So many of my friends already moved to la mirada but now many are moving to whittier.

"I’ve lived in Whittier for over 10+ years and in and around the area (Norwalk, SFS etc) for my whole life and this part of Whittier has always been a bit rough.

Over recent years there has been a bit of a homeless “issue,” but I’d say the area as a whole has gotten better over the past few years.

Uptown Whittier which just down Philadelphia used to be a dead place with roaming teens and homeless and it now has a decent nightlife and restaurants. Though there still are roaming teens and homeless, lol, I’ve never had an issue. I was one of those teens myself. :)

With the new construction with the Groves also comes tax money and shopping which should revitalize the area over the next decade.

I also run the Greenway Trail which is very nice and also very close and never had a real issue, though I’m a man and always run during the day.

Another thing and without getting too touchy, but this has been a working class Latino neighborhood for many years. On local Facebook groups for Whittier and just in general I kinda get a “unwelcoming” vibe from longtime residents directed at the Groves community which is predominantly Asian / Mixed.

"It's a nice enough neighborhood. My kids went to Ceres elementary, Granada Middle, and Cal High, and we've lived in the area for 20 years. For grocery shopping, we prefer the La Mirada StaterBros at Telegraph/Imperial, NOT the closer one on Mulberry/Mills. It's a totally different vibe. Go east, not west for your errands lol.  South Whittier is a bit rougher than East Whittier. In my opinion though, the neighborhood has improved over the years.  I like the park/track at Telegraph & Valley View and how they've improved the median on Telegraph. And I always see people walking their dogs. Occasionally you'll see random homeless/addict stragglers walking through though, so just be aware. But it's really not that often. One example is we did construction on our house a couple of years ago and placed a port-a-potty out in the front yard for the crew.

"Lots of shopping options very close by. The only issue is that Telegraph Rd is a major artery in this area so it can be very busy. That plus all the businesses will sometimes bring a negative element to the area. Mostly addicts or homeless. The further away from Telegraph the quieter and more walkable it will be. My Aunt has lived between Gunn and Mills for over 30 years. It's a okay neighborhood imo.

Regarding traffic and convenience... my biggest issue with living in Whittier is proximity to freeways. It's nice not having the noise and all but when you need to get somewhere, it can be a bit of a trek to get to a freeway. Hence why Telegraph gets so busy.

"These are great answers. I would just add that Whittier has some great hills for hiking (Turnbull Canyon, Sycamore Canyon, Hellman Park, to name a few) and there are some decent roads for cycling. So if you're into riding or hiking you landed in a good spot.

"1. People in Whittier are friendly, if maybe a little cliquish. The population is mostly Los Angeles-area natives, so maybe not as openly social as some of the more transplant areas of Los Angeles. But generally a laid back, down to earth residential area.

2. During traffic times, getting to the beach is going to be tough. If you mean like during the week rush hour, you’re at least going against traffic, so maybe an hour. I’d say on the weekends, the quickest you can get to the beach off peak hours is around 45 minutes. An hour or a little more during busy weekend hours. The closest beaches are Huntington Beach and the Long Beach beaches.

3. Being a transplant isn’t a factor at all in Whittier. In the city of LA, there’s tons of transplants everywhere so it’s not a big deal. You might hear snide remarks on the internet, but that’s a general resentment of transplants as a whole. Realistically though in person, nobody will care you’re a transplant as an individual. No one will hold it against you as a person.

4. I want to say the coldest is around January and February. Maybe in the low to mid 40s…sometimes lower in the very early morning. It lasts maybe a couple months with random warm days scattered in there

Whittier is a small suburb that feels a lot like it’s own town in many ways, even while in the greater LA area. It’s a quiet residential area that’s more family oriented than anything. Not very exciting for a person in their early 20s. Depending on where you live, you might find it way more convenient to head into neighboring Orange County for different things…while heading toward LA for more social life.",t2_2rdhxlhm,SanchosaurusRex,0,1635714436.0,0,t1_hit6bea,hit6bea,True,[deleted],t3_qjxkua,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/qjxkua/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Whittier/comments/qjxkua/deleted_by_user/hit6bea/,13,r/Whittier,0,13

"Rode island has competitive laws on the books so you can choose to get power from ""unregulated energy suppliers"" their utility is closer to if we got energy from the CPUC. With SCE, they're our only utility we have to use them. when they want a price increase they still have to get it approved by the California public utilities commission. Their request is reconciled on their cost of adding infrastructure for supporting customers with solar, fire prevention, and preventing blackouts. The yearly trend has been is 7.5% increase each year, but next year the price increase is going to be 8.9% 



So take that average price per kWh. For this homeowner it's 0.22¢ but for your home say it's 0.255¢ multiply it times your usage for the year

You can get your yearly usage if you log on to the SCE website, under usage, go to monthly trend and add up the kWh's for 12 months. For this home they used 11,778 kWh at 22¢ so they've spent $2,591.16 this year

Without yearly increases $2,591.16 over 30 years which is what a solar system is guaranteed for. They'll pay  $77,734.80 with SCE 

To calculate your cost with yearly increases take your yearly cost, for this home it's $2,591.16 and add 7.5% compounding every year, (even though this year it's 8.9%) for 30 years 
This part is tricky for me because I want to do it in a way that everyone can do it for themselves at home, so I just used a [compound interest calculator](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php) and copied the table into [excel and summed the last column](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VMM4E5ax9ZbFtvwxlaUtJXmmPa1qCcsjAAFhIz1PHek/edit?usp=drivesdk) If the average yearly increase is 7.5% over 30 years this homeowner will pay $290,609.86 
If we're very conservative and say the Average rate increase will only be 4% over 30 years this homeowner will pay $153,729.17 with SCE


A Solar system for this home costs .11¢ per kWh x 11,778 kWh 

per month they'll pay around $107.96 

Per year they'll pay $1,295.58 

Their yearly usage x 30 years, their total cost is $38,867.40 



I just want everyone in Whittier to have a price analysis of what they're paying. If you dm me your bill I'll give you a full breakdown and approximate price of solar for your home.",t2_e4mtt4f8,nectardream,0,1631767723.0,0,t1_hd1kfbs,hd1kfbs,False,nectardream,t3_pnx86l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/pnx86l/how_sce_obfuscates_the_price_youre_paying_for/,How SCE obfuscates the price youre paying for power.,/r/Whittier/comments/pnx86l/how_sce_obfuscates_the_price_youre_paying_for/hd1kfbs/,2,r/Whittier,0,2

"So they divided out the price they're charging you per kWh and separating it from fees that are also charged per kWh. And then they give you a graphic to represent the total price as if it's only 0.17¢ 

If you want to know what you're actually paying you divide the total price by kWh. It's 0.22¢ and it's on a tiered rate system. With solar  for this house, they'll only pay 0.11¢ per kWh Total. 

 On Oct 1st SCE is going to try again to move everyone to time of use. And then theres yearly scheduled rate increases.

An old 1 hp pump draws 10 amps for 8 hours a day in the summer. you can do things to lower the bill, like replacing it with a variable speed pump, [there's rebates ](https://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program?zipcode=90605). you can run your pump at night so that its not running during peak hours to lower your bill.

to see if you'll save money with Solar I would look at your bill and simulate what it would look like if you had a solar system and compare them in dollars and cents. Because every house is different there's not one answer. My friend has a barn style roof with beautiful giant trees and lots of shade, he has a variable speed pump that runs at night, his house stays relatively cool in the summer, for him a tesla battery would be a better cost saving purchase, because his roof doesn't get very much sunlight, and with a battery he can store energy at night to use during peak hours. At my house I have an EV that plugs in, with a broad south facing roof with no tree cover. my house is great for Solar.  [google has a tool for you to look at your roof to see if its optimal](https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/).

if you dm me your SCE bill I can run it though my program and look at your roof and simulate how much it'll be worth it. if it would be worth it. otherwise there's free calculators online  [solarsage.com](https://solarsage.com) has one. to give you a proposal I would need to come look at your house, I would check your electrical boxes, your roof, and plan what your usage will look like in future.",t2_e4mtt4f8,nectardream,0,1630023118.0,0,t1_hahrt2d,hahrt2d,False,nectardream,t3_pb6klq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/pb6klq/im_getting_into_selling_solar_i_was_wondering_if/,"I'm getting into selling solar, I was wondering if you guys could ask me questions and I'll try to answer them as a study guide.",/r/Whittier/comments/pb6klq/im_getting_into_selling_solar_i_was_wondering_if/hahrt2d/,2,r/Whittier,0,2

"you can do this very cheaply. except I think you'll want a nice retractable mounting rack so you don't have to do a bunch of labor every time you go somewhere. the most power you would want is probably for a microwave a small fridge maybe 3 or 4 outlets and some lighting. you already have a battery connected to an inverter.

so you connect the battery to a controller and then connect the controller to the panels in a series connection. the controller is a shutoff switch for the panels so they don't overload your battery. the panels and the battery are in DC and then your inverter changes it to AC for your devices. [This link was really helpful and comes with a nice diagram](https://heliusenergy.com/how-to-connect-two-solar-panels-to-one-battery/) it recommends a 300ah deep cycle battery.

"On the other side of the hill in Rowland Heights has some of the best Asian food in the country. A little closer than the west SGV. Lots of Boba, Taiwanese food, regional Chinese food.

Down in Buena Park is some of the best Korean food in the country. Lots of sulbing spots for dessert.

Whittier and La Mirada have a few boba spots that are heat or miss.  Not great quality but Hiccups is okay for some boba or noodles in a pinch. The surrounding areas are a lot better though.

"I'm usually a see both sides kind of person, and I don't like the overly casual use of the term NIMBY, but I don't really value the negative feedback from some people who seem to be keen on obstructing *everything* in Whittier.

I think making access possible for emergency and delivery vehicles is a definite prerequisite. Also gives the opportunity to have parades or car shows if the city decides they want to open up for it.

But I'm not convinced about this argument that it would make it less handicapped accessible. It doesn't make sense. How does any mall, venue, attraction exist without having cars be able to park 6 feet away from a storefront?

There's one particularly vocal detractor that acts like Greenleaf is like the main artery of Whittier. When the promenade opened, he was all over Nextdoor and Facebook complaining about it. He insisted nobody would want to go there, that Whittier will never be a destination, and that the promenade was a ghost town. He wanted it to fail, but it proved to be very popular...and Uptown is livelier than its ever been on the weekends.

My only concern is that the city is pushing to remove all the ficus trees that line Greenleaf which would dramatically alter the environment.

Other than that, I'm all for it. I think a lot of businesses can benefit, new ones can be attracted as well. And other than an auto shop or something like that (which I'm not aware of existing on that stretch of Greenleaf), most businesses should be able to adapt.",t2_2rdhxlhm,SanchosaurusRex,0,1623450766.0,0,t1_h1gfym0,h1gfym0,True,themaryarias,t3_nxq4bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/nxq4bn/the_future_of_uptown/,The Future of Uptown,/r/Whittier/comments/nxq4bn/the_future_of_uptown/h1gfym0/,9,r/Whittier,0,9

"Yeah there’s a quota. Condos are fine, but I’m skeptical with the way they’re going about it. Also skeptical about the arbitrary quota being set by Sacramento without taking local traffic constraints into account.

I think it’s about money in the end. If they were smart or actually cared, they’d do almost all the building around Uptown and the coming E Line extension. Not in an extremely landlocked area with no freeways, public transportation, and dependent on two hill roads that close down occasionally.

And it’s personal choice on condo vs SFH. Condos, small lot homes are more efficient from a city planning and resources POV. But getting a home with a lot is the smarter investment in my opinion. Especially somewhere like Whittier that has some of the cheapest homes in the county. A little work and maintenance now can pay off a ton later when the city/county is a lot denser with more new condo inventory hitting the market every year.",t2_2rdhxlhm,SanchosaurusRex,0,1623272347.0,0,t1_h179hfv,h179hfv,False,richcournoyer,t3_nvaaaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/nvaaaw/whittier_daily_news_fyi_whittiers_blue_hills/,"Whittier Daily News FYI: Whittier’s Blue Hills Nursery to close, be replaced with 54 condominiums",/r/Whittier/comments/nvaaaw/whittier_daily_news_fyi_whittiers_blue_hills/h179hfv/,1,r/Whittier,0,1

"RIP Skateland.

So many good times there. I also lived in the area affected by groundwater contamination from the Omega Chemical Corp. The Omega Chemical Corp. was a refrigerant and solvent recycling facility that operated between 1976 and 1991 handling drums and bulk loads of industrial waste solvents and chemicals used in the processing of commercial products. According to the EPA, more than 2,700 drums, as well as more than 12,500 pounds of contaminants, have been removed from the soil and groundwater and more than 30 million gallons of contaminated water have been treated since 2009.The location was designated a Superfund site in 1999 and added to the Superfund National Priorities list the same year.More information about the settlement can be found on the EPA’s website as well as information about the Superfund site here: [https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.Cleanup&id=0903349#bkground](https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.Cleanup&id=0903349#bkground)

"Having had both I can confidently say that they both suck absolute donkey buals equally. They both lie through their teeth about how *their* fiber is sooooo lightening fast an way better than the other guys.

They are lying. If they have copper infrastructure at **ANY** point in the upstream, which they both do, it will be throttled to copper speeds.

You can save between $20 and $50 a year by switching everytime the new costumer deal goes through but honestly auto asphyxiation while doing your own wisdom tooth extraction is easier than dealing with these monopolies on the phone.

"*everyone* who pays attention to politics knows the election was stolen. A number of statistical anomalies in the battleground states have been swept under the rug, including significant changes in absentee ballot rejection rates from previous elections, and excessively high voter turnout (at times exceeding 100 percent).  

In the 2020 race, Georgia election officials received 1,320,154 mail-in and absentee ballots. If these ballots had been rejected at the 2016 rate of 6.8% instead of the 2020 rate of 0.34%, there would have been 81,321 ballots rejected instead of the 4,489 ballots that were actually rejected.

Under the conservative assumption that 60% of these mail-in and absentee ballots went to Joe Biden, this dramatic fall in the rejection rate provided Joe Biden with an additional 16,264 votes. That’s more than the margin of the alleged Biden victory in Georgia.  


You know and I know, this was the establishment getting their control back. Donald Trump carried the election. The reason you have a vaccine is Donald Trump. The reason your stock portfolio has down so well is Donald Trump. The reason your gas prices were so was Donald Trump. The man wasn't a saint, I don't worship him, and disagreed with him on things like the border wall, but he was elected for a reason and I hope your side doesn't forget that.",t2_7zdea,SauerkrautandBeans,0,1615583013.0,0,t1_gqqdorg,gqqdorg,False,WhitterDailyBrews,t3_m336kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/m336kc/former_bottle_room_employee_arrested_by_fbi_for/,Former Bottle Room employee arrested by FBI for participation in Jan. 6 attack on US Capitol.,/r/Whittier/comments/m336kc/former_bottle_room_employee_arrested_by_fbi_for/gqqdorg/,0,r/Whittier,0,0

"How can the election be stolen and trump supporters like you be a repressed minority? The blm protests were much bigger than the capital riot. 

I have a friend who was brainwashed into being a trump supporter and he's still in it. He can't pull out of his programming and doesn't want to. He's not a bad person, he's not even a dumb person, but his mind has always been susceptible to frauds. I had to get him out of all kinds of things, flat earth pizzagate. When I first met him he had this thing called drunvolieo which was like a cult that was going to meet at the pyramids of Giza at a certain date and ascend to the next dimension. I couldn't get him out of the trump cult. I think part of whats keeping him is that its designed to make him socially repulsive. He keeps listening to conservative rush Limbaughs for company and then thinks he's rush Limbaugh type person and then other people that were his friends stop wanting him around. Which feeds into his loneliness and that only makes him clutch harder to like fox and friends because theyre now his only friends. 

I think it shows something how you guys are only repeating slogans and like you believe the election was stolen. But you dont support it with evidence. If you did people could show you where you're wrong. I think you're scared to find out that you were wrong when you went all in.

Growing up here in whittier I've seen many changes (currently 21) yes there has been a crime increase from a few years ago but not that bad. Homelessness as much as people say it's bad it's only the same people I've seen growing up that I know are nice and are just mentally ill. Food place wise very mom and pop shop like. My go to places when I want to eat out is pizza mania and lascaries. Since you'll be at whitfier College when you are done with classes for the day you  could just walk over to the local theater once that opens back up. But it's nice to walk through some streets of of uptown. The trail that goes through town is planning to be expanded some more. A great place for a walk is at the rose hills cemetery. While yes its a giant graveyard it's very nice and very peaceful. Traffic wise usually around normal city times it gets busy like 7-9am when people are heading g to school and work. Whittier boulevard is always somewhat busy throughout the day. The city is also split in two jurisdictions there city of whittier police and the LA sheriffs.,t2_1k0t4x1b,Marinegrunt01,0,1613940356.0,0,t1_go9jxqx,go9jxqx,True,toemot,t3_loqfhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/,Moving to Whittier?,/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/go9jxqx/,3,r/Whittier,0,3

"It's interesting hearing from recent arrivals. I've been here three years myself.

The thing I like about Uptown is that its mostly driven by young small business owners. They have a pretty tight community. So it's not as old-fashioned feeling like Orange Circle, but not as corporate as say Old Pasadena. Feels very intimate with a great independent business scene. There's still a lot of old fashioned ""Main Street"" type businesses, but I see it developing pretty nicely in the near future. I think it's a sleeper cool neighborhood that'll probably step up more as more of the Baby Boomers move on and this influx of younger people priced out of LA keeps up.

But yeah, development is coming majorly. The Groves will be the first big project, but I'm thinking we're going to be seeing Whittier Blvd densify a lot over the next 10 years (for better or worse). And the younger people are already coming in, like you say, being priced out of LA. And also the pandemic seems to have pushed more people out here...people are discovering these well-maintained SFHs on nice streets...so a good place or more space and house for the money if you telework...or for people within a certain budget wanting to take advantage of these rates.

I moved here in 2018, and immediately recognized this was a great place or a starter home. It was extremely undervalued here...there were still homes in the $400k-500k range. Even now, the median price here is below the median price of LA County, but those same houses are pushing closer and beyond $700k as LA is pushing a million. I don't think Whittier is any more remote than most of the SFV or SGV, but with the lack of freeways, it goes a lot more unnoticed...and to be honest, I think it's nicer here. Most of the city is nice with good school and amenities...so a good place to buy into. 

We might be selling and going back to LA, but it's really sad for us. We could see this being a community we want to stay in, but unfortunately we need to be closer to work and family. For people working in DTLA or the SGV...this is a great place to consider for a family.",t2_2rdhxlhm,SanchosaurusRex,0,1613938340.0,0,t1_go9fub4,go9fub4,False,toemot,t3_loqfhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/,Moving to Whittier?,/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/go9fub4/,4,r/Whittier,0,4
"Whittier is a nice suburb for the most part. More family oriented than anything. The rougher part of towns are the southern part of Uptown, South Whittier, and West Whittier...but the latter is developing quite a bit. The rest ranges from rich areas, nice historic areas, and tons of well-maintained post-war suburbia.

The thing about Whittier is that it's ""LA"" being within the county, but Orange County is a lot more accessible. The distance from freeways is a pain in the ass, but living in the town itself is pretty chill. You'll find that while you're close to LA attractions as the crow flies, places in Orange County like Downtown Fullerton, Anaheim, Brea, etc are way more accessible. 

The closer beaches are Huntington Beach (Orange County) and the beaches of Long Beach (LA County).

Whittier is a good base to explore the greater LA / OC region as a long term resident, though I'd never recommend it as a central location for someone vacationing here for a week or something.

Whittier itself is a nice community, Uptown is a great place with a good amount of places to drink and eat. While the town isn't full of transplants resulting in that kind of random mingling crowd nightlife you'd find more in the city..if you're with college friends, there's plenty to do locally. 

Crime, relative to the Los Angeles area, is *not* that bad. A lot of boomers here act like it's hell on earth, but most of the city is pretty safe relative to Los Angeles. Crime tends to be more like property crime, petty theft. As far as homeless ""slander"", you'll see in Los Angeles the transient vagrant situation is pretty intense. I think you'll understand more why it's such a controversial, emotional topic here. But anyway, the homeless presence in Whittier completely pales in comparison to the current situation you'll find in most of Los Angeles. In LA, much larger encampments and problems of people getting assaulted and harassed. That doesn't happen very often at all here. Most keep to themselves, with the random occasional person wandering around. Much less intense situation than in the city. Whittier, to me, feels shielded from a lot of the issues hurting LA right now, including intense homelessness and rising violent crime. By LA standards, Whittier is suburbia, but it's still part of a big city. Stuff happens, but it's not going to be nearly as intense as many parts of LA.

All said, the pros of Whittier is that its a nice town, easy to get around, plenty of amenities, and Uptown is a cool little area. The cons mostly have to do with the lack of freeway access and relative difficulty of getting to other places in LA.

One thing to keep in mind is that LA is a massive patchwork of communities. You might not be near Santa Monica, but the adjacent San Gabriel Valley and Orange County have tons to offer as well. Whittier is next to some of the best Chinese food in North America (Rowland Heights), a great Korean suburb with lots of great markets and restaurants (Buena Park) as well as near some great parks and hiking (La Mirada Regional Park, Murphy Ranch, Hellman Trail) etc etc.",t2_2rdhxlhm,SanchosaurusRex,0,1613936814.0,0,t1_go9cau9,go9cau9,True,toemot,t3_loqfhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/,Moving to Whittier?,/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/go9cau9/,5,r/Whittier,0,5
"I really benefitted from small class sizes. I think the largest class I had was around 45 students. The smallest class I was in was around 9 in my senior year. The professor’s actually know your name and they take roll in class. Don’t be afraid to ask for help and attend office hours. I was also a transfer from a nearby community college where class sizes were much larger, and I don’t remember roll being taken. This could be a good thing or bad thing, depending how important it is to you whether you attend classes or not. With all that money you’re paying you would think that attending class is your #1 priority. 

Which leads me to my next point. In all universities and colleges you meet people from all walks of life, different socio-economic backgrounds, etc. But at small schools everything is under a microscope. You meet me people who are very down to earth, and who are very accepting, but then you meet people with an enormous amount of money. Some kids openly brag about their families money, and are so far out of touch with reality you think they live in Sleeping Beauty’s castle at Disneyland. Most of them play lacrosse. Then you meet people who are working two jobs and attending school full time just to feed themselves. Just like the city, there is an enormous gap between rich and low income students. 

Since it’s a small school, if someone does something stupid and embarrassing at a party on Saturday, everyone is going to know about it on Monday. It’s like a high school in that sense. It can also be very cliquey, but that does not mean the people that are cliquey are not cool or down to earth, because most are. Just be cool. I still keep in contact with a lot of the people I went to school with there, and some of them are my closest friends. 

The food. The Campus Inn where meals are served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is absolutely abysmal. Again, with all the money you pay you think it would be halfway decent. It’s not. I only looked forward to Chicken Parm nights and Turkey Picatta nights. Don’t worry, you will hear all about that. Across the quad is a grill called The Spot, but you gotta pay cash, and is not part of the meal plan. The meals are made fresh. 

Get involved with things. Join a club or three, study abroad, ask questions, be curious. Take classes that sound cool. I still regret not taking a class focused on the Lord of The Rings or a class titled “The Search for Extraterrestrial Life.” I did take a class in Jan Term that studied the sociocultural perspectives of people living in DTLA. Taking field trips every day to Skid Row was fun. Although Professor Howard passed a few years ago, and idk if that class being offered. Although I had some friends take this one Jan Term class where they went on a Buddhist Temple retreat for a week at a nearby Buddhist temple.",t2_csypr,LunchBox07,0,1613935352.0,0,t1_go98sa4,go98sa4,False,toemot,t3_loqfhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/,Moving to Whittier?,/r/Whittier/comments/loqfhz/moving_to_whittier/go98sa4/,5,r/Whittier,0,5

"Whittier College alumni here, also born and raised in Whittier. There is plenty of things to like and dislike about this town, but some things are a matter of preference. In fact, you can say the same thing about the college since it’s so small and has its own culture. 

Uptown Whittier is a decent area for food and bars. Although a handful of bars stay open until 2am, most of them close at 12am. Specifically I recommend the Chicken Koop and JDO (Mediterranean) for food. Go south a little ways to South Whittier and try Pizzamania. The best pizza there is, anywhere. There is some decent hiking trails nearby, but can get pretty crowded if you don’t get there early enough. 

I don’t like how Whittier is not really close to freeways. The drive to DTLA and the beaches can get old after awhile, but that’s only if you work out there and commute from Whittier.
