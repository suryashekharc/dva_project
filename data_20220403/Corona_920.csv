"Corona is pretty diverse.. you have everyone here from hardcore Trump loyalist/conservatives/redneck types to all spectrum of races living peacefully at least.. there's plenty of asian food places here especially around Corona Hills.

There's a recent newly renovated dog park by Griffin way. 

There's Tom's Farm down south 15 where they have small town vibe that has restaurants with live bands during the weekends... though its a biker ""gang"" and car meet ups area but still family friendly.

"Corona is much older, Eastvale is less old but they’re always busting marijuana grows the rental tenants are shit and frankly the city just feels hollow, also there’s no cell service. I’m not kidding, every time I visit my dad my phone goes dead. 

Can’t say enough good things about Temescal Valley.  I feel like I’m in a different state. I’m so glad I left Eastvale. The people are friendly, the hoa takes care of the trees, plants and grass. The community pools are awesome. Tons of parks. There’s even street sweeping once a week it seems. Our yard isn’t big, but I’m sure there are larger lots. 

Now. With that all said the 15 freeway is the main artery and traffic in the morning and evenings going to and from the 91/15 interchange (back towards Eastvale corona) can be atrocious. But CA has traffic everywhere, you can’t escape it. Best to live with it by getting up early, knowing alternate routes and taking it easy. 

But I’ll never regret moving here. We’re only 1.5 hrs from San Diego. I feel like it’s practically my back yard. No problem with fire insurance but maybe because we were already here. There was a fire called the “Holy fire”, google it. It surrounded us like a horse shoe and we did have to evac. But cal fire came in and kicked it’s ass. It’s not flatland so I didn’t expect it to wipe us out.

"Because DA Hestrin doesn't charge cops for anything, period, full stop.  That's why he tossed it to the Grand Jury--he wanted to let the cop off, but the Costco video was clear.  The cop lost his cool and wasted or tried to waste three people who hadn't done anything to deserve it.  But the problem was that letting the cop walk would look bad.  What to do?

Hestrin knew that no Riverside County Grand Jury  would ever bring charges against a cop.  Grand Juries sit for 1 year.  1 year of getting paid $15 a day.  Who can afford to be without work and income for 1 year?  Simple: old folks, and usually old white folks.  In Riverside County, that's as good as saying ""Republicans.""  Hestrin didn't need to throw the case.  All he had to do to ensure that no charges would be brought was present it to the Grand Jury.

But then something unexpected happened.  The killing of George Floyd spurred the state legislature to pass a law saying that the State Attorney General's office had to examine all officer-involved shootings in the recent past, and bring charges where warranted in cases where local prosecutors had refused to do so.  That process took time.  But now, it has happened.",t2_di7t6e0e,Chillpill411,0,1628711350.0,0,t1_h8kn7gf,h8kn7gf,False,MakeMine5,t3_p18po5,https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/p18po5/exlapd_officer_arrested_for_2019_corona_costco/,Ex-LAPD officer arrested for 2019 Corona Costco shooting.,/r/corona/comments/p18po5/exlapd_officer_arrested_for_2019_corona_costco/h8kn7gf/,3,r/corona,0,3

"I can only answer general questions with my knowledge of HOAs, but for this specific one you should contact the management company and they can answer your questions. The website shows Powerstone is their mgmt, and the number listed is 	
949-372-4029. 

Generally speaking, HOAs that do not allow RV parking will allow you to have it onsite for loading or unloading for 1-2 days with advance notice. 

Commercial vehicles are probably not allowed to be parked in view so it would need to be inside the garage or outside of the community somewhere. If it looks like a regular truck you might be fine.

Most HOAs won't care about personal gatherings on your property as long as you do not disturb neighbors. Figure out the parking rules and keep noise levels down, also find out the ""quiet hours"" and don't have loud parties at night.

Friends staying with you will depend on parking rules more than anything else. That's a good question to ask management.

"I know a few people that live in the retreat and have been there a handful of times. When having a party you just have to tell security and you can either give them the names of the people you are expecting or that it’s open gate if you have too many people. I think you can only bring like 2 guests to the pool though if you don’t have one in your backyard. 

The HOA hosts holiday activities like egg hunts and santa. 

The golf course behind the retreat has been closed down so the mountain isn’t as pretty and maintained as it was before.

> In 2012 news broke of an identity theft ring operating through a paid subscriber to Ancestry.com. The woman was mining information from birth records and the Social Security database, primarily selling them for the purpose of filing fraudulent tax returns. Changes were made and now only Social Security numbers of persons who have been deceased ten years or more are accessible on the site.

This scammer also creates [fly-by-night websites](https://www.heritagehuntersgenealogy.com/) that they link to for you to give them personal identifiable information and payment details. Stay away from www.heritagehuntersgenealogy.com or whatever else it ends up getting changed to in the future.

"Late 20s, lived almost my entire life in Corona, spent my college years in LA. Even as a teen I always envisioned myself coming back to raise a family on Corona.

Right off the bat, the nightlife and entertainment doesn't even come close to what you're likely used to. Even for ""quiet"" things to do, Corona is pretty lacking. Riverside is def the place to go for things like mini golf, bowling, concerts, etc. There has been a push the past 5-ish years to increase artisan shops, boutique restaurants and the like, but it's been slow going and almost all of it in the Dos Lagos area. Growing up, parks were where it was at. Corona has tons of them, a couple of nice trails, lots of amenities. There are some good restaurants here and there, maybe one or two good sushi spots, and some typical chains you see everywhere. Can't complain, it's actually a pretty diverse city food-wise, you're likely to find what you're looking for. Except soul food, might have to drive a bit to Riverside to find good spots for that.

Traffic is horrible. It has pretty much only gotten worse, and is likely to get even worse with some proposed developments in the neighboring cities. It all has to come through the 91 :( They had a recent freeway expansion and added some toll roads, but like, the entrance and exit to those are still on the edges of the city...meaning you are often still forced to get on the freeway at the same bottlenecks as before. It's not totally unbearable but there are pretty much no alternatives, which is what sets it apart from LA traffic. There's no side streets, and if there are, it's all residential with tons of stop signs. If you're trying to get out of the city, and there's an accident, good luck. 

Schools are amazing. CNUSD has a long history of success, and even the ""ghetto"" schools perform very well across the board. They've been good about keeping up with modern stuff like robotics clubs, new makerspaces, and facilitating afterschool clubs and activities. 

As far as housing goes, you can find what you like. It's gotten a bit overpriced lately but the gist of it is ""still cheaper than OC."" West Corona probably has some of the more affordable stuff that's still nice, just a bit dated. McKinley, South Main, Eagle Glen, Green River, are all pretty much equivalent in terms of housing.  

All in all, Corona is a great place to live. It's just a great environment for a young family. Mostly clean, quiet, and friendly. Weather is fantastic, and apart from the occasional mild earthquake and wildfire, there is really nothing bad that happens here. *knocks on wood*

Edit: Oh and socially, there are indeed a few racists and snobs here and there, but overall it's a pretty chill city. We do get a fair share of OC transplants, and the city just *loves* to compare itself to our neighbors to the West, but the truth is the people here get along fine regardless. You'll run into some ugly neighbors but most people really do just enjoy living here.",t2_8lgcl,MartOut,0,1612406037.0,0,t1_glxwmjq,glxwmjq,True,[deleted],t3_l3t28i,https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/l3t28i/considering_moving_to_corona_what_should_i_know/,"Considering moving to Corona, what should I know?",/r/corona/comments/l3t28i/considering_moving_to_corona_what_should_i_know/glxwmjq/,2,r/corona,0,2

"Main/Mag is older corona, on the way to the newer center which is around ontario/15 freeway.

Its a great area, not much crime besides car breakins, lots of grocery options, easy to get to freeways etc. Santana park is right there and its a massive, awesome park with tons to do. Also a grocery store and multiple other stores in the shopping center right there. Library is even close, and multiple schools.

I grew up off Border a bit further to the West and spent a lot of time in that area. Older houses but beautiful neighborhoods with older trees and things, which can be hard to find in South Corona where everything is a lot newer. And the parades are usually down main, things like the 4th of July, which can be really fun with a small town vibe.

I dont live there any more, the big city called me lol but for raising a family you wont be upset.

Also, I've never heard of THE bonfire, but having bonfires is a thing every teenager in Corona did when I was growing up, either near lake matthews, up skyline or down in South Corona, especially before a lot of the newer houses were there. Essentially just an outdoor party that solves the issue of finding a house to have a party at. Prob went to 2-3 a month or held 2-3 a month.

"I’ve live in corona since 2001, we moved from LA as well. There is a medium sized black population but you’ve gotta seek us out. Chances are your children will be one or the only few in their classes. They will never or rarely have a teacher that looks like them. You will experience, implicit and explicit racism and certainly micro-agressions from well meaning neighborhoods and/or friends. “The nicer neighborhoods” is code if you know what I mean. We put our children in private school for the diversity-be sure to be involved in your children education- find black organizations to connect with if it’s important for your children to have people around them who will validate the greatness. 
Living out here is what you make it..it’s not LA, we’ve balanced what was missing as far as a black community by seeking it out throughout the I.E.  
The public schools offer some great programs, If you go that way but stay on top of the teachers and advocate for your children or they could fall between the cracks. (Check out the data of black and brown students in the area.) 

Do not move to Norco, PERIODT! 

EASTVALE, has a larger more educated, upper-mobile black community with young families. Plus, the homes are more reasonably priced. The schools are newer with more state of the art resources and programs. Black folks over there are building their own community  look there.. I hope this helps from a black perspective.

"My family has lived here since 2008... I have SO much advice for you 

-corona was split between norco (north corona) and corona & it’s essentially just a long city 

-norco is a whiter area... horseback, ranch style homes, probably the racism you heard about 

-corona & it’s public schools are fairly diverse 

-temescal valley is where you’ll find a huge chunk of the homes, especially the newer & nicer ones but there’s only two shopping centers in the whole area (one with a Vons & the other is the outdoor market Toms Farm— a really cute Sunday day trip sort of place) theres a good public academy grades k-8 here that every adores 

-the next most northern community is around dos Lagos, those are nice homes & dos Lagos is a nice outlet with a little lake & movie theatre that offers good deals 

-the next most northern place is eagle Glenn off cajalco it has one medium and one large shopping centers with a theatre target Best Buy etc most of your errands can be done at “the crossings” this area has a mixture of home prices 

-el cerrito is unfortunately a little lower income but I went to middle school there and never felt unsafe 

-Ontario & Magnolias freeway exits are where the bulk of corona is (everything else south is just housing/mining) these areas have a wide variety of housing prices, all of the high schools, ~80% of food options, downtown corona, easy access to the 91

-the further south you go in corona the more it has a small town kinda feel where everyone in the shopping area knows each other (I live in temescal valley area) 

-the further south your go the worse traffic gets going north traffic here is literally a nightmare it is comparable to LA it will easily take 30-45 minutes going from temescal canyon road to magnolia between 630a - 830a & 3p-7p *give or take some time & how the virus has influenced it*

-there are lots of easy side roads but everyone takes those too 

-you can cut to riverside with the Cajalco Pass or to Orange County with Ortega Highway those both go through the mountains and are winding

-centennial is an IB school & has one of the top football teams in the state & one of the middle schools has an IB program too i can’t remember which one 

-I’ve been out of high school for a minute but last I heard there’s debate about not bussing students in the southern area to the high schools which is a problem because they’re all around magnolia 

-RCC & NCC are decent community colleges and UCR is a fairly decent UC, NCC has a program with JFK high school to take college classes while in high school 

-food options are very basic there’s variety but they’re not unique or recommendable & there are only a handful of international markets 

-Theres several sushi shops, lots of American eatery, downtown has a good Mexican food scene, of course chinese, poke is getting big, there’s some south Asian/MENA places, tons of chain restaurants, off the top of my head I don’t think there’s a diversity of Europeans/African/Southern/Latin American restaurants (read: I’ve lived her for over a decade and haven’t heard of one) 

-you’re about an hour from everything which is really nice (1 hr from Disneyland, knotts, beaches, mtns, Orange County, LA) (1.5 hrs from Palm Springs, San Diego) 

-the 15 is a major freeway that can take you all the way to Mexico or Utah 

-it’s a republican district with trump supporters here and there but the city isn’t and people aren’t very politically active 

-it is a good place to raise a family, it’s safe, there’s few significantly negative influences, it has a bloated police budget

-there is a weird thing that happens in the cajalco pass called the bonfire I can’t give a ton of details because I don’t know but from what I hear it’s basically white people getting drunk, driving dirt bikes and trucks, being rowdy, getting into fights, carrying, etc you get the picture that’s also probably where you hear worries of racism coming from i think it only happens once or twice a month but I don’t keep that company so I’m not sure it’s definitely not a huge issue though 

-if your kids are older I would recommend being further north but if they’re younger and you plan to set up shop for a while go south 

-lake Elsinore is not great because it’s dirty/poorer and the lake smells and the further south you go the further issues like racism become present like Murrieta (no offense LE I know you guys are trying your best, offense to you Murrieta get it together)

-downtown riverside is nice and there’s more food options in that city, it’s also a fairly politically active city because of the universities & RCC has a strong poli sci department 

-LE has a nice shopping outlet & lots of hills for dirt biking 

-if you go further south you need a car but if you stay in the northern area walking is a viable option 

-for fun you can go on a trip to another city, go to dos Lagos or Toms farm to take your family out, go to the movies, there’s paintball in temescal, there’s hiking at Skyline, castle park is in riverside

"Corona isn't racist, but of course there are dumb asses living here, but it's not a thing if that makes sense. Lived here for 20+ years and haven't experienced anything that I'd say was a run in with a racist. However, that's just my experience.

Food wise you're not going to beat LA, but Corona does have some good spots. There's definitely good Mexican food like Taqueria 2 Potrillos and Tortas Sinaloa. There are decent options for Korean and Japanese food, but I usually head in to OC/LA if I'm looking for that. We've got Kra Z Kai's which is A+ Laotian BBQ if you're in to that sort of thing. I haven't been, but there's a soul food spot called Sunday Dinners Soul Food that I hear is good.

Would I recommend a move? Depends. It's quiet, there's not much of a social scene, and the traffic sucks. But it's quiet, there's good hiking options, and you're near other cities with better social scenes. Personally would I move here? No. But if I were looking to settle down and raise a family I'd definitely consider it.",t2_4yzh6,hardcorefrokid,0,1611482871.0,0,t1_gkizdgp,gkizdgp,True,[deleted],t3_l3t28i,https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/l3t28i/considering_moving_to_corona_what_should_i_know/,"Considering moving to Corona, what should I know?",/r/corona/comments/l3t28i/considering_moving_to_corona_what_should_i_know/gkizdgp/,21,r/corona,0,21
"Well, I think there are a lot of things to consider so if you care to share more about your situation and perhaps where else you are considering, that would be much more helpful.

"We lived there for five years and never encountered any white supremacists or racism. We're a biracial couple (white and Mexican) with three mixed kids. We were in north Corona, blocks from the Norco border and just a few minutes south of Eastvale. Our kids went to school in Norco. It was very mixed, mostly white and Mexican but plenty of black people and Asians. Eastvale has a significant black population. I honestly never thought racism was a thing to worry about there.

Not a lot of good food, to be honest. I think south Corona has even fewer options. We moved there from Orange County and the food was what we missed most. There are some decent Korean restaurants in Riverside, not too far from north Corona. We found a few good pho places. Plenty of Mexican food, but nothing amazing. There are some sushi places. You'll meet your basic needs, but nothing to write home about. I don't think I ever saw a soul food place, but there are some in Riverside.

There were some really good diners, though, like Silver Dollar Pancake House, Betty Faye's, Cowgirl Cafe (Norco), and the Airport Cafe.

Corona was just really boring. There's very little good shopping, restaurants, or entertainment. It's fairly quiet. South Corona has The Crossings and Dos Lagos shopping centers, which are ok. We ended up going to Eastvale for some dining and Rancho Cucamonga (45 minutes north) for shopping. Rancho also has a lot of great restaurants.

If you don't mind driving for some of the good places it's a nice central location. Orange County isn't too far, as long as you steer clear of peak traffic times. Rancho isn't too far to visit frequently and Riverside has a few more options too.

The people are nice.

"Orange Unified has been back full time for months and while there have been cases here and there, no outbreaks have been recorded. 
My elementary age child is not doing well with distance learning at all. 
She’s literally regressed and cannot even sit through her zoom classes. I have made sure to have the work in front of her and the teacher is going over it, and she still cannot circle the correct answers. 
CNUSD is going back for 2.5 hours a day M-Thurs in am or pm “cohorts.” 
There will be masks and social distancing as well as plastic barriers to help prevent the spread of the virus. 
The district gave parents the option to choose between the virtual only schedule or the distance learning until they reopen schools options. Many of us chose the latter and need our kids to return in the safest way available to us. 
I have multiple children and only one of whom is going back because that is what is offered. 
My daughter’s teacher is also looking forward to returning to the classroom.
For my family it’s a win-win situation. This is what we chose and we are happy about the return. 

Those who chose this learning model are ok with our decision. Like I said, it’s only 2 1-2 hours per day M-Th. 
I for one am ok with this. 
And if there is an outbreak with more than 5% affected, they will close down again. 
Furthermore, it’s my understanding that Orange Unified school district has been open for months and has yet to have an outbreak. However there have been a few students here and there that have contracted the virus. 
I have no official documentation, as I’m merely a parent and not an official source. 
The information I received about Orange Unified is from the mouth of a family member who works for the district.

"That seems to be asking rather a lot! The key for me is sustainable economic development so we can stand on our own and not be a virtual dumping ground for LA/OC. We have no university, terrible infrastructure, and businesses have no good reason to settle in the area since the poverty rate is so stubbornly high.

The whys about changing direction economically are numerous, but let's start with a steady decline in living standards. We are not 17th in the world and falling in quality of life, and 27th in social mobility, which means we are no longer the land of opportunity. We are the sickest people in the rich world, with a health care system rated dead last, the 35th healthiest population, and 36th in child wellness, with higher levels of childhood poverty than Mexico. And we are losing our freedoms in the process, with the US now ranked 52nd in the world for individual liberty. (Calvert's extremely authoritarian voting record has played a part in that.)

Wages have been stagnant for forty years, such that adjusting for inflation most Americans are making no more now than we did in the 1970s. Yet the cost of housing, health care, and education have risen far faster than both inflation and wage growth, which has seen an explosion in consumer debt. The bottom 50% of the population has actually DECLINED in wealth by a collective TRILLION dollars since the Reagan era, and tax rates on working people are considerably higher than they were under Kennedy (though we get less for them now than we did then).

The real economy is the money circulating between people and businesses, not the stock market. In the 1960s, 90% of market transactions reflected the real economy -- real businesses with employees and facilities etc. -- and only 10% were speculative. Now the number is reversed, with 90% of stock market transactions having nothing to do with the real economy at all. And 85% of that stock is owned by 10% of the country anyway, so all that ""wealth"" they generate among themselves has nothing to do with us. The economic incentives these days are all wrong -- we reward people for taking money out of the economy and slowing overall growth rates.

We need to get federal policy back to the good job it did in the '50s and '60s, when everyone's pay rose with productivity and we created the middle class lifestyle. We need to invest in American businesses and American workers, and rebuild our economy from the ground up, not from the top down. Our infrastructure is rated a D, and that weakness costs the economy countless billions in lost productivity.

And the benefits of our work go only to the top, not to us -- most American families never recovered from the 2008 recession, and all increase in wealth since then has been in the top ten per cent. We need to remember that true wealth trickles up, not down, and stop wasting our money on corporate subsidies, foreign wars, and corrupt tax schemes. We can all make more money, pay less in taxes, and have a far higher quality of life, if we just follow the data and evidence instead of ideology.

Regarding safety, the single best thing you can do to reduce crime is make it unappealing in relation to a dignified life within the law. So, better education, a lower cost of living, and good job in the area will do that. If you have someone making a choice between minimum wage at a burger joint and no ability to afford rent, or selling drugs, many people will make the latter choice. But the evidence, both in the US and around the world, has shown that when people can get a real job and pay their bills, they choose that course virtually every time.

Crime rates throughout the rich world have fallen because they paid attention to the data and addressed the socioeconomic factors. In the US we opted for the lash instead of the carrot -- with the result that we have one-quarter of the entire planet's prison population and STILL have the highest crime rates in the rich world. So to increase our public safety and reduce crime, we need to increase living standards through sustainable local economic development.",t2_6xttrv77,Liam-OMara,0,1603836433.0,0,t1_gabi3q4,gabi3q4,False,Liam-OMara,t3_jj2ybw,https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/jj2ybw/crosspost_im_liam_omara_congressional_candidate/,"[Crosspost] I'm Liam O'Mara, congressional candidate in CA-42 and working class historian, and I believe forty years of neoliberalism have wrecked the American Dream so I'm here to fight back!

"Corona off Rimpau and magnolia there is a barber open. That being said, most of the workers there quit and the last one remaining is the owner who is a complete nutjob who refuses to wear a mask and thinks the whole thing is a hoax. I should also mention it looks like she hasn't brushed her teeth in years and the last time I went her dog (a black lab on a leash sitting right next to me) kept barking at me. 

I know the teeth shouldn't matter, but there is an absurd amount of plaque sitting on her front teeth that you could scrape off with a butter knife and the breath that comes with it is rancid.

So yeah.. its open, but she is also an awful person. Does a great job at cutting hair though.",t2_xludb,headgirl,0,1596971185.0,0,t1_g0vr0rb,g0vr0rb,True,CheeseMakingMom,t3_i69oc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/corona/comments/i69oc9/is_there_a_barber_open/,Is there a barber open?,/r/corona/comments/i69oc9/is_there_a_barber_open/g0vr0rb/,2,r/corona,0,2

ps i heard a rumor that the unconscionable generation of men who deem themselves elite that are nearing their final days are so fucking pissed that their adrenachrome has not even come close to the fountain of youth that they were sold....so in grasping at straws and in their decrepid fear of facing either a future of nothingness or being righteously yet lovingly judged by their true Creator, they decided to not even covertly come forth with what they thought was a deadly human ending virus that they aptly named ""king""....but what they failed to ever realize that no matter how many so called top tier scientists tell you that they can use this particle with that molecule and voila heres your inorganic synthesized drug or weapon.....ALL AND EVERY infantecimil cell goes back to One Creator and One Source.....thee most hi over all the earth.....case closed.
