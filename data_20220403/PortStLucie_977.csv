"Honestly, just quit and work mcDonalds for a pay raise. They won't learn until they are desperate enough to make changes.

They can afford the pay hike. What does it cost for daycare. Like $500 a week per kid at cheap places. There is very little overhead needed, so the profit margins are about 75% . They can afford to pay more. 

How many kids are there, at least 50 right? At 500 a week, your employers are make 25,000 a week salaries are likely at most 2000 of that per week. This is a high profit margin business. Just force them to pay a decent amount by refusing to continue.

Even today she needs the pastor/or whoever's permission to even come and visit us. What really set me off and led me to do more research is how they expect you to come in and work for them for free without any compensation, you're suppose to give up your debit cards and everything.

idk how they expect you to do better if once your year is up your only options are to stay with the ministry longer (where you will continue working for free) or leaving without a job, money or a place to go, seems set up to keep people there for free labor, not to actually help anyone in the long term.",t2_jtowd,MugenHeadNinja,0,1646654268.0,0,t1_hzozqgo,hzozqgo,False,MugenHeadNinja,t3_t7zpqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortStLucie/comments/t7zpqf/need_information_on_good_samaritan/,Need information on Good Samaritan Ministries/Pastor Vito,/r/PortStLucie/comments/t7zpqf/need_information_on_good_samaritan/hzozqgo/,1,r/PortStLucie,0,1

"Asian from PSL, the diversity here is okay but it's not the greatest. I find Palm Beach/Jupiter more diverse with more options though in this area the food options aren't the greatest. There are a few grocery stores though. My parents and I like to go to Foodtown in West Palm Beach and La Rice near the Treasure Coast Mall for groceries. PSL has its fun points like Tradition Square and such, but for younger people, I feel like this stuff gets old quick. There are a lot of retirees here. 

Public schools are better in the Palm Beach area speaking as a former math competition girl from a smaller school in PSL, the resources in Palm Beach/Jupiter are overall better for education. The schools in PSL are all pretty decent though, but as someone who recently got out of the system, I feel like our schools are really underfunded and I actually faced a lot of bullying for my ethnicity (Chinese) there so I have a lot of bitter feelings towards the PSL schools. 

PSL is pretty safe. There is still crime (my family got robbed a decade ago), but it's nothing like the city where I live right now (Gainesville). If you're looking for Chinese schools, tbh, go on WeChat for your local area where you settle down and there will be an old auntie willing to do it for free/dirt cheap.

Gainesville hasn't changed much in over a decade. If you like being in the middle of nowhere go that route. PSL still doesn't have the city life but its grown considerably and shopping and daily conveniences are easy. Plus you're a lot closer to Palm Beach or Orlando if you'd like to get out to something different. Housing prices in PSL are skyrocketing though and I can't speak on Gainsville homes.

"You could look at the Jensen Beach area if you want to be closest to the beach, but otherwise you'll be close to some body of water no matter where you settle. 

You're basically looking at PSL, Jensen Beach, Stuart, and Jupiter.  Plenty of really good public school options in there.  I don't know how Martin or  Palm Beach counties do their school assignments, but in St Lucie you aren't zoned for a particular school so much as a set of schools.  You submit preferences when you register your kids.  It's pretty unlikely you'll get worse than your 2nd option so it's not too bad.  There really aren't any bad schools where you're looking.

I guess whether people are friendlier depends on your past experiences.  Florida has a much different vibe than other parts of the country.  I moved here from the northeast and I remember going to Home Depot to buy some stuff for the house.  I was loading my car with some large boxes and noticed two guys walking up to me out of the corner of my eye.  I was expecting to be mugged.  Instead they helped me load the car and handed me a pamphlet to join them at their church.  So compared to up north, yeah much friendlier.

As far as diversity, no it's not SoCal but I don't think you or your children would ever feel out of place or anything like that.  

I can't speak for other areas, but unfortunately I think you will be disappointed in the lack of authentic Asian cuisine.   There are a few specialty markets around the area but I don't know if there are any Asian markets specifically.   There are probably more further south.  For the most part we have your standard Chinese food places, although there are a few different pho restaurants and a hot pot place in PSL.  

As far as safety, yeah you'll be fine.  PSL is one of the safest places to live in Florida.  That isn't to say there is no crime, but there is really nowhere in town where.you aren't safe. PSL basically has newer and older sections as opposed to safe and unsafe.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"It might sound dorky, but Girl Scouts / Boy Scouts is a good way to meet some friends, get some social interaction going, and acquire some new experiences.  Cost of entry is low and can be zero at least in Girl Scouts.

I lead a GS troop, and have a few FLVS students in my troop.  We run a little young for your age bracket (my oldest are currently 13) but there are troops for every age bracket.

Aside from scouting, there are a couple of performing groups / community theatre / community band is always a great place to meet folks.",t2_95nbx,faderjockey,0,1643516299.0,0,t1_hut80u9,hut80u9,True,jagebus,t3_sfyzwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortStLucie/comments/sfyzwz/any_advice_for_a_homeschool_student/,Any advice for a homeschool student?,/r/PortStLucie/comments/sfyzwz/any_advice_for_a_homeschool_student/hut80u9/,5,r/PortStLucie,0,5

To be fair, I'm just being funny.  There are some very nice beaches on the FL east coast. Tequesta is especially beautiful.  So many are inaccessible due to development or private ownership, and the public beaches tend to be crowded and the water not too friendly.  My favorite beach is Walton Rocks.

I was in Fort Pierce a while back and stopped at La Haciendita Super Taqueria on Orange Avenue and it was super delicious. Super crowded too though. I got tacos to go and ate them at the lone picnic table outside in front of the smoky grill -- not very atmospheric. Just warning you.

"Moved over from Fort Myers 1.5 years ago.

Fort Myers : 

\+Better corporate things to do. Dave Busters/Top Golf/Chain type places

\+Airport with direct flights to most of the east coast and its easy in and out

\+Gulf Coast

\+fishing/boating

\+Cost is slightly less depending on where you decide. Im lumping in Cape Coral and Lehigh there. Past Estero south its not affordable anymore

Minus

\-FMB is a bitch to get to and parking south of the beach (Bonita Springs) in between houses is a game of chicken so while the Gulf is warm you cant really enjoy it as much

\-Polution from the Lake. Get ready for summers of brackish poluted coastline

\-Lack of real work. The line of cars heading to Naples in the morning is a sight to behold

\-Its not quite there with the age groups yet but i think that is slowly changing. Young people tend to live in Cape Coral and Lehigh with Fort Myers getting them too. it used to be just old and its trending younger

&#x200B;

PSL

\+Easier access to the beaches. I go to jensen but i could easily hide away in Fort Pierce area as well

\+Housing is being built crazy fast out here but there is still more of a neighborhood feel here than what you get in Cape Coral or Lehigh acres. Fort Myers is like that in parts of town but we will see how gentrification goes as a whole

\+I-95/Turnpike I can be in Kissimmee in 1:30 min and West Palm in 45 mins

\+Work is great in the trade industry. I'm not sure about the real industry as there isnt much here for that.

\+Quieter 

&#x200B;

Minus

\-No airport. WPB or FLL/MIA. MCO is an option as well at least.

\-Atlantic isnt the gulf 

\-Infrastructure isnt bad but they will be eminent domaining some more houses eventually as the side streets are too full of people at times. City didnt buy open lots when it could for more parks or to deal with eventual traffic. 

\-lack of corporate kind of places to have fun at if thats your thing.

\-You will be leaving town for most ""fun things""

"There was a homicide by me off of airoso Blvd. Someone was found rolled in a carpet in a home down the street from me. This was within a couple weeks ago. I'm guessing homicide because the guy probably didn't roll himself up in that rug. Cops were there all day and aftermath cleaning service are still there. That particular crime didn't make it to the news. 

Of course you probably know about the murder in tradition in the past couple days. Probably targeted but who knows. 

My husband was leaving the house for work a few weeks ago and there was a hovering helicopter telling someone to come out with there hands up over a loud speaker. 

Someone tried breaking in my sister's home recently, same day as the person found in the carpet and just down the street. The person was throwing themselves against the garage trying to gain entry that way. She pulled out her gun and announced she had a loaded weapon, and the person went away. 

Two people were shot while sitting in a car off green river parkway.it was targeted.
  
One of the more horrific instances happened in sandpiper bay. A man shot two of his neighbors dead, a dad and little girl, over an incident involving the man's dog.

These are only a few very recent examples of crime here. 

Is PSL safe? I don't know. There are a lot of people that live here and there comes more crime with that. It's hard to know what to think. It's a city. There are common problems that come with that. I think twice when I'm out. I know my surroundings and keep my doors locked in my house and in my car, even if I'm sitting in it waiting for someone.

The north Indrio Rd, #1 Riverside west of U.S. 1, and #3 east of U.S. 1 are solidifying into CBS homes that you essentially rent for life because you don't own the ground lease.  They are generally nice places and you can also have a traditional modular single or double wide home. Be advised that a mobile home park is not where you want to be in a tropical storm or worse!  Also be advised that the units have grandfather clauses that maintain your association fees for the life of your ownership, but rise to market rates when you roll over the ownership.

"It's the furthest thing from an investment, it's closer to a longterm Co-op lease. It's basically a trailer park that's slowly converting to concrete block homes. You'll never own the land the home sits on and the Home Owners Association is expensive comparatively speaking. Selling and Buying in Spanish Lakes is hit and miss, some homes sell really fast others languish for months without an offer. The area is nice but not great. There is still tons of improvements that are needed to make the area more appealing. It's a 55 plus community so you get all the drama that comes with these retiree communities. I have family there and they like it because it's quiet, I like it because they are near to me. 

CAVEAT EMPTOR: It's not a good real estate investment. It's decent if you purchase to live there but the price of the association is steep regardless of what they offer. You're leasing the land. Currently, they may be selling faster than usual but eventually, when the market settles down they will be difficult to resell. Before the market to a sharp incline, some homeowners opted to walk away from their 80K - 120K investment rather than struggle with the monthly association payments and property taxes, so that should tell you everything you need to know about the Real Estate side of it.

"If you want a vibrant downtown and active nightlife, PSL is not the place for you.  However, it's close enough that you can always shoot down 95 to West Palm or further south when you want those things.  

Yes the city is growing like crazy and a lot of people are relocating from down south or from out of state.  I don't see the lack of a downtown as a deterrent for growth.  You can always go into Tradition Square if you need a downtown feel and there's some decent restaurants/bars there.  A lot of businesses have come to the area.  If you're in a Healthcare field this is probably a great area to look for work.  

As far as an investment, depends on what you mean.  An investment as in buying a home and raising a family down the road?  Sure.  Good schools.  Safe neighborhoods.  Lots of nice parks.

St Lucie County resources are stretched thin. There are people with families that have been struggling to recover from the pandemic.

Your goals of college are well and good, but at this point, you‚Äôre bringing nothing to the community, and instead will be looking for assistance. Get on Facebook marketplace in this area, and look for rentals. People are charging $700,800,1000 to rent a bedroom in their house. A one bedroom apartment will run you about $1500+ a month. You‚Äôll need a 1st,  month, last month, and security deposit, so $4500 to get in. And you will need to earn 3x your rent per month, and have decent credit, over 600 score, to pass the credit check. Not my business, but how is it you have a co-signer to help you out, but no one to stay with while you work for a few months, and save up some money then move here?

"I'm not saying avoid the housing authority.  It's at least worth a drive up there to see if there's anything they can do.  Worst they can say is sorry, but either way when you're coming into town you're going to drive through Fort Pierce first anyway.  You could probably call them and see if there's anything they can advise you of over the phone.  

The other thing you could do is look at renting a room.  You could check Facebook marketplace.   I've seen listings for people looking for roommates or looking to rent out extra rooms in their home.  Might be a short term solution and would help with the local address you mentioned.  

Definitely check out Career Source.   Their office is on University Blvd across from the baseball stadium.  I've seen help wanted signs all over.   And construction is booming here if you can do that kind of work.  I'm honestly not sure the wages have kept up which is probably part of why there's so many signs.  My landscaper was just complaining about needing to bring on someone to keep up with his business but he wanted to pay $10 an hour.  Not gonna get someone to break their back in the Florida heat all day every day for ten bucks an hour.   FedEx was hiring for a new facility here and I think Amazon has a facility in Ft Pierce.

"The housing authority is in Fort Pierce on Orange I believe.  Like everywhere  in Florida, there is a lack of affordable housing in PSL.  There is a nonprofit called Carebag that has a mobile shower unit and some basic necessities.  There is a Career Source that can help with employment.  There really isn't too much else.

No, having an address in Utah won't help you.  You'd probably be better off making up an address.  There are plenty of places hiring around here, but it depends on what you're looking to do.  Manual labor probably won't care what you put down as an address.   Neither will bars or restaurants.  Worst case scenario is you use an address in Utah and say you're new to the area and staying with a friend temporarily or just make one up.

Yes it is safer than Orlando, but don't park in residential neighborhoods and try to sleep or you'll have cops moving you along.  You can't swing a cat without finding a church around here though so maybe see if one of them will let you park there at night.

"There are those who feel that a frame home flexes and is more forgiving to wind or settling than is a CBS counterpart.  Both designs have improved greatly since standards adhere to the Miami-Dade codes of 2002 or 2010.  You find heavy windows and openings, and elevation or roof design for a low wind profile.  Almost forgot to mention 2x6 framing for enhanced strength over 2x4 framing.

  In this county, in about 1995, the lot elevation above sea level was raised from 12' to 15' (forgive me, this is from memory), so along particular streets in the south and west of the county you'll see random houses lower or higher than neighbors.

"When my wife and I were looking we did see some stick builds in Martin and St Lucie counties.  I ran insurance quotes on one we really liked and it was bonkers.

The majority of the homes we looked at in PSL were CBS construction.  For reference, we were looking at properties not in HOAs.  

Not being native to S. FL, I didn‚Äôt realize what a difference wind mitigation credits make.  If you‚Äôre not already familiar, talk to a realtor and/or an insurance agent.

"Pretty much what everyone said already. If your husband will be working in WPB, it will be a good 45min to 1 hr drive South from PSL. The closer you are to 95 the better it will be to get down South or moving around PSL West area, Housing prices will be a little higher down South as well. As for around here? Stuart, Palm City ,Becker, Tradition, Jensen Beach, St. Lucie West, Torino area ( between St. Lucie West exit and Midway Rd exit ) Ft. Pierce downtown, Vero Beach are what you got. There are restaurants East of Becker Rd heading towards US 1. Treasure Coast Mall in Jensen Beach, and the Indian River Mall in Vero Beach. A lot of good restaurants and shops around those towns as well. Down South you have Abacoa , Jupiter, Jupiter Farms, Palm Beach Gardens, PGA, Delray Beach, Boynton Beach, Lake Worth, Wellington. All these have downtowns, restaurants, shopping malls, housing developments and such. There are many suburbs in the Western part of WPB area as well like off Jog Rd or 441. Look East and West for what you like, good schools, and what's in your price range. Good luck.

Edit: There's more things to do with the family and for the kids in WPB or in Broward county as well. All you hear is that there isn't anything to do around here. I hear that a lot from teenagers. If you want to go to a concert, it will have to be down South or Orlando. Vero Beach has the only roller skating rink left in this area. There used to be one in PSL, but that closed down like 10 -15 yrs ago. The one in Ft. Pierce closed down like 2 yrs ago. There are talks of a wave pool in Ft. Pierce at this moment. There is a miniature golf and go-cart place in Stuart just West of 95 as well. That's been there awhile. They just opened up a place for kids called Urban Air Adventure Park off US 1 in PSL. Rock climbing, go carts etc. There is also FLYING PANDA EXTREME AIR SPORTS in St. Lucie West for the kids as well. Opened up about 1.5 yrs ago. If your family likes outdoor things. There's plenty to do as other's have  mentioned. The Treasure Coast has grown a lot since I have been here.

"Went with the fam a month or so ago. I'm not at all into this kind of thing (complete absence of skill for things w/multiple buttons/controllers) but managed to have a good time.

There are a lot of pinball machines in the front section, but I'd guesstimate pinball accounted for maybe 15% of the games overall. Probably a little something for everyone there. All kinds of retro games, and a bunch more in a room with TV screens and emulators.

They had a decent enough selection of adult beverages. No food, so we went elsewhere when everyone got hungry, then returned to play a bit more. 

Cool thing about the setup is that they did one price and wristbands. No coins, cards or per-game charge ‚Äì it's all on free play.

"When the economy picked up, PSL became a property speculator and house-flipper paradise.  Hopefully you know the kind of principals and clientele to whom I refer.  When the economy crashed, many were left holding the bag.  As a result, you couldn't swing a cat around here without hitting a disgruntled stuck-in-a-job employee, desperate-for-work construction trade specialist, multi-level marketer, or relative of a house flipper keeping the place showable.  


There's nothing wrong with PSL, per se.  There are parts of town I consider uninvestable, and other parts have overplayed the glitzy, trash-cash aura of towns like Boca who sent their residents as fugitives here to escape zero lot lines and downtown buskers.  


At your age and disposition, I'd recommend you map the local schools and focus on your child students and mobility concerns.   Miss a mark, and you're a long way from any conveniences or services.

I find that when vocals are too sharp especially in the S and T pronunciation range in words, it feels a bit weird almost demo-like instead of a full fledged song, but by ever so slightly blending it in a bit so the treble in the vocals doesn't sound too separate from the beat, you get a good blend while still keeping the vocals in their own range parallel to the beat.

"Oh- like other places, commute traffic is a thing. Try and remember that Port Saint Lucie Blvd is a total train wreck from US One (on the east side) allllllllll the way across to Becker Road (on the west side) from 4 until 6:30 every evening. It‚Äôs terrible. I avoid it at all costs. 

PSL is only 60 years old. It was not really ever imagined that it would grow the way it has.

"Port St. Lucie is definitely not just Becker. 
Tradition, Saint Lucie West, both of those are more dense with homes and restaurants. Becker area is just getting built up. In the 5 years I‚Äôve been here that region has gone from literally trees to houses and there‚Äôs a lot more planned. 


Coming from a compact place like Orlando there will be huge differences. Everything here is basically 2-3 stories at maximum. Tons of strip mall style businesses and restaurants. Lots of small community parks. Next to no night life, especially outside of smaller bars in those same strip malls. There‚Äôs not really a ‚Äúdowntown‚Äù type of area unless you count tradition and that‚Äôs more local to them. So there‚Äôs the negative things for me, at least. 

BUT. The school my son is in is wonderful. For outdoors things this area is wonderful. You Dan go to Oxbow and the Savannahs preserve. Near my house there‚Äôs a huge preserve with a burial mound. Pre-Covid there were festivals every weekend within PSL, Fort Pierce, Stuart, and/or Jensen Beach. Beaches are close and lovely. Pretty easy access to 95 or the turnpike from most areas. If I need to be at a concert I‚Äôm 45 minutes from West Palm. I‚Äôm 2 hours from Orlando so the parks are a day trip if wanted. 2 hours to Miami. 


I come from a small town so Port Saint Lucie is fine for me. There‚Äôs pros and cons for being here, and it‚Äôs not for everyone. For us we have access to amenities in the large cities while enjoying the family friendly and outdoors things of a smaller one.",t2_4xsuo8cq,overthinkeverything-,0,1630243169.0,0,t1_hassx16,hassx16,True,MurkyConcert2906,t3_pduoyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortStLucie/comments/pduoyj/considering_moving_to_port_st_lucieopen_to_other/,Considering moving to Port St. Lucie/open to other surrounding cities.,/r/PortStLucie/comments/pduoyj/considering_moving_to_port_st_lucieopen_to_other/hassx16/,11,r/PortStLucie,0,11

I agree they call them arcades but they are really casinos. I've never seen anything like it. it's kind of weird I thought that gambling was illegal in the United States apart from Vegas or on an Indian Reservation but apparently Port Saint Lucie goes by its own rules. In any other County even those small machines if they're ever caught giving out cash they get shut down immediately but now that these arcades they blatantly give out cash & everyone knows about it. But the reason why they're so many is because it brings a lot of money because there's literally nothing else to do in Port St Lucie. But that's how they operate in this town even the police department is red like this I mean ever wondered how the next town over on South Martin County only can house 500 inmates and the to the north of Vero Beach House 400 inmates but yet Port St Lucie is Rock Road can house 1500 and is always packed and have people were sitting there for two years without ever seeing a judge.,t2_8hpjcdrg,lordamos21,0,1629590037.0,0,t1_h9uk7rr,h9uk7rr,True,handymannyswetdream,t3_p3pwel,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortStLucie/comments/p3pwel/why_so_many_adult_arcades/,Why so many adult arcades?,/r/PortStLucie/comments/p3pwel/why_so_many_adult_arcades/h9uk7rr/,1,r/PortStLucie,0,1

"The canal just south of Becker. There's a discharge station that's loaded with bass. You can get to it from Rad Ct in PSL or if you want a nice drive, Boatramp Ave in Martin Co. 

It gets fished a lot so artificial lures aren't great but if you can find live shiners it's a lot of fun- especially when the water is flowing. 

There are speckled perch in there too, but IDK about eating anything out of the canals lol.

If you want salt-water I do pretty well right on the beach.",t2_70iqxv8z,t-w-i-a,0,1628711056.0,0,t1_h8kmhwb,h8kmhwb,True,Spiderflaw,t3_p2518n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PortStLucie/comments/p2518n/fishing_spots/,Fishing spots,/r/PortStLucie/comments/p2518n/fishing_spots/h8kmhwb/,3,r/PortStLucie,0,3
"IDK, it‚Äôs pretty common to be asked to wait for service at a medical office, although I‚Äôll grant that an hour is a bit much.

That said, thanks to COVID dental procedures take a lot longer than they used to.  Extra care and turn around time between patients. 

You might also have been waiting for a specific practitioner.  Were you there for a basic cleaning or something more advanced / challenging?

My wife‚Äôs allergist does this thing where they check you in and then you go sit in your car until they are ready to call you back.  I‚Äôm not sure if that would translate over to dental procedures but it does help keep folks out of the waiting room.
