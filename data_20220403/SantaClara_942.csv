But instead we're stuck with Gillmor and Watanabe acting like children having a tantrum over the fact that the stadium even exists.   

We should be having concerts and events at Levi's every night and raking in the revenue from the 49ers and hotel taxes.  We should stop wasting money on multi-million dollar loser lawsuits like the one to try and keep the city council seats at-large and the one auditing the 49ers -- both of which went nowhere because they were completely baseless. We should stop wasting money on soccer fields and swim centers that are 95%+ used by people in other cities while the taxpayers of Santa Clara foot 100% of the bill.  Then maybe we'd have the budget to do things that benefit actual Santa Clarans like renovating our decrepit parks or building more low cost housing. 

The sooner Gillmor, Watanabe and all their cronies are gone the better.  Their management of the city has been embarrassingly awful.",t2_ig70g,NeonSapphire,0,1646085545.0,0,t1_hyu16lm,hyu16lm,False,svvoice1,t3_t3but4,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/t3but4/city_manager_fired_critics_blame_jed_york/,City Manager Fired: Critics Blame Jed York,/r/santaclara/comments/t3but4/city_manager_fired_critics_blame_jed_york/hyu16lm/,4,r/santaclara,0,4

">#Santa Clara County won’t budge just yet on mask mandate, despite state’s announcement

>*“As you know, we are always seeking to do what we can to be the most protective but also flexible,”* said Dr. Cody during Tuesday’s meeting in response to a question from Board President Mike Wasserman. *“We are looking at our data and where we are in the omicron wave and just going through the process that we usually do and don’t have a decision to share from this point.”*
>In answering Wasserman’s question, Dr. Cody did not offer any benchmarks or parameters the county would have to meet for the mask mandate to be loosened. So far, Sacramento, Marin and Solano Counties have all announced that they will be following the state’s rules. Contra Costa County health officials said at a meeting Tuesday that they were “still evaluating” whether to align with the state in dropping the county’s mask mandate. The county’s health department will likely make a decision by the end of this week after conferring with other Bay Area officials, a deputy health director said at the meeting.

Looks like the rest of the Bay Area's Public Health Directors are going to look at each other and say *""I'll hold out if you hold out""*... or maybe it's simply *""You first.""*

My marker's on them extending it until 5 weeks after the ""6 months to 5 year"" vaccine is approved, which should theoretically happen around the first week of March, which buys them until mid-April, while the rest of the state moves on.",t2_4xy7s,Halaku,0,1644365274.0,0,t1_hw5m91g,hw5m91g,True,Halaku,t3_snywwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/snywwv/santa_clara_county_wont_be_loosening_mask_rules/,Santa Clara County won't be loosening mask rules just yet...,/r/santaclara/comments/snywwv/santa_clara_county_wont_be_loosening_mask_rules/hw5m91g/,5,r/santaclara,0,5

"wow that’s a pretty messed up situation. The guy had sexual relations with his 14 yr old daughter; their relationship was more akin to boyfriend-girlfriend rather than father-daughter according to her own account.

Appellant was estranged from Jane since infancy and subsequently reunited with her when she was 13 years old. Soon after reuniting, appellant and Jane began spending a lot of time together and developed a close relationship, which Jane described as ""boyfriend/girlfriend type"" more than a ""father/daughter"" type. According to the probation report, ""the two had texted each other and talked on the phone in a sexual manner, discussing sexual activity.""

Jane explained that when her cell phone dropped onto appellant's lap, she ""began rubbing [his] penis, and they both pulled down his shorts, exposing his erect penis.""

Carrying or transporting it in public is when you need to be careful of the law. You must not carry it concealed. It must be carried in open view and sheathed.

There are also restrictions on where you can bring it. You cannot bring it inside of government buildings. While it would be obvious that you should not bring it inside of a courthouse, it is less obvious that the law applies to other government buildings such as libraries. It is questionable bringing one into a history museum inside of a state park or a library to teach history. You can't bring one onto school grounds either. While it is obvious that it is possibly unwise to bring one to an elementary school, the law includes colleges and universities. Is your frat house on school-owned land?

I highly recommend San Jose City College Beauty School.
They are open to the public.
All services are performed by students who are trying to earn a degree in Cosmetology.
And yes you are allowed to tip the students and the rest of the money goes towards the school.
If you go, I recommend getting what is called a full day of beauty I believe it costs about $38.00 and that includes a haircut, facial, mani and pedi.

"Unfortunately most of the homeless around the Bay Area fall into one of two categories.

1. Truly homeless and likely suffering from some mental health issues. This is likely who you had the encounter with.

2. Grifters, who aren't actually homeless and try to make a few bucks by taking advantage of the kindness of others. Folks outside Target at El Camino and Scott or who sit under left-hand turn lane lights are a good example.

While I would be surprised if they had a gun, a stabbing implement probably isn't out of the question. Sadly folks with mental health issues can be unpredictable and potentially dangerous.

The Santa Clara Police Department will probably take a statement, but their response is going to feel condescending and unhelpful. Arresting a homeless person isn't going to help the homeless person, but there isn't much the police department can do after the fact.

To answer your original question, most of the homeless person encounters I've had have not resulted in them getting in my personal space or throwing things at me. They're usually either keeping to themselves or take no for an answer.",t2_8xh707da,Delta-26,0,1636879259.0,0,t1_hkkecvy,hkkecvy,True,crazybuscommuter,t3_qtkjyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/qtkjyw/is_it_common_to_get_attacked_by_a_homeless_man/,is it common to get attacked by a homeless man?,/r/santaclara/comments/qtkjyw/is_it_common_to_get_attacked_by_a_homeless_man/hkkecvy/,13,r/santaclara,0,13

"The best way I've learned to make friends is to do the things you love or want to learn and you'll find people that you can share those things with. So you have something in common - trying to bring people into things *they* don't share an interest in is way harder. 

I know it's way harder with covid but you can still join clubs at school and when you're happy it will make it easier to make connections. Schools are good for that. 

I'm sorry you're lonely, that can be really rough. At your age I also struggled and learned that it's better to be happy as you rather than try to mold yourself to fit with others. You're not cringe, you just haven't yet found your tribe. 

Be kind to yourself and good luck.",t2_3m92e,porradavfr,0,1636099285.0,0,t1_hje2qcy,hje2qcy,True,True-Necessary827,t3_qln6e9,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/qln6e9/heyo_just_looking_for_friends/,heyo just looking for friends,/r/santaclara/comments/qln6e9/heyo_just_looking_for_friends/hje2qcy/,1,r/santaclara,0,1

My experience is:

- The water is generally hard. You may want a water softener. If not, you'll have to deal with calcium build up and the issues it causes.

- In the summer, often alternate water sources get used and the water has a noticeable chemical taste.

- My wife doesn't care for the taste of the water, ever (summer or not), so we use bottled water for drinking purposes.

- I don't think there are any safety issues. Should be no need for a lead filter.

- On the map, I'm in the cross-hatched orange area labeled ""Blend of Well Water and SCVWD treated surface water.""

"Mainly because no companies are incentivized to do anything.

There are a few pockets of AT&T fiber around. The city owned dark fiber is largely business/datacenter related. As someone else mentioned, Google abandoned its fiber to the home initiative because of pole rights around the bay area. Comcast and AT&T fought them hard and apparently the local politics were too great.

It's really too bad. I use to have AT&T fiber in San Jose. I now live in Santa Clara just a few blocks from an AT&T CO, but can't get it currently. The neighborhood clearly had top tier tech a while ago (VDSL), but seems abandoned by AT&T in terms of upgrading.

I even went through a bunch of pain with Comcast to see if I could get their ""Gigabit Pro"" service - which is $300/month for a 2gbps symmetrical connection, but I was too far from the fiber node.

Sail is now available in my area (their wireless service - not fiber). QoS of wireless, latency, and total bandwidth aren't compelling enough. Sonic typically runs through AT&T's infrastructure, so is not an option either.

I now quietly wait for either:

1. AT&T actually outfitting the neighborhood for fiber
2. Comcast replacing their RF/coax runs with fiber to implement docssis 4.0.

"Yeah you got done good there by your roommate. I’m assuming since you said august was your last month you’ve moved out already. In any case, the lowest cost option here would be to a) pay your back rent and make sure to get that transaction in writing from your landlord and keep any and all receipts (I’d suggest a cashiers check from your Bank). Your landlord then needs to document your move out and refund any deposit you may have had on file net of any reasonable damages (carpet cleaning, wall touch ups etc). Say nothing more/less to your landlord and assuming you have your agreement with your roommate in writing, see if you can go after them in small claims court. Life lesson: try your best to stick to traditional leasing arrangements in the future and if you’re going to have roommates, everybody needs to be on the lease.

"I've lived in woodsborough for about 10 years, been in Santa Clara nearly three decades. Woodsborough is nice and quiet overall, but not perfect. 

Pros:


-Quiet, sometimes too quiet

-Very walkable area, overall very safe

-Lots of stores and restaurants within a 1-mile radius

-Central Park is across the street

-3 swimming pools, hot tub, clubhouse, ping pong table, billiards table available to tenants

-Lots of shade, units generally remain temperate throughout the year

-Pet friendly

-If you live near the fountain, it provides some nice white noise

Cons:


-Package theft can be an issue if the delivery person doesn't leave it right at your doorstep. Mailboxes had been broken into a few times, not too common but it does happen

-Cars can get broken into if you're not careful. I once forgot to lock my car and found that someone stole some cash

-A friend left their Suzuki GSXR motorcycle unlocked in their carport for a few hours and it was gone when they came back out, this was in ~2016

-Laundry facility is not the greatest, the card reader may take a few tries to get right, cleanliness leaves something to be desired
-Common area maintenance is very minimal, sometimes lights are flickering/out, door knobs and locks take some getting used to

-Some owners leave their carport empty and take up common area parking spaces, so if you come home later, there may not be parking if your carport is occupied

-High pollen count due to trees. Your car will be covered in yellow pollen eventually

-Lots of spiders because of the bushes and trees. Sometimes we get ants. Roaches come out at night (outside area). Silverfish also sometimes can find their way inside

-Loud geese during their mating season, I hope you're a morning person


For nearby places to eat, here of some of my personal favorites: 


-Stan's donuts - Their glazed donuts are the best I've ever had, make sure to eat them right away

-Demiya - amazing Japanese curry

-Orenchi Ramen - solid ramen, great flavor, can get quite busy during peak hours

-One Ramen - another great ramen joint, their Karage chicken is the best I've ever had and it's decently priced. Vegan-friendly option

-Mission City Grill - overall great breakfast and lunch food, quality is pretty consistent

-Poke Poke Fish Bar - amazing poke bowls, always fresh, consistent quality

-Grub Burger - decent sit-down burger joint, only been there once, but enjoyed the flavor and portions. I'm more of a fast food kinda person so I still prefer In n Out or The Habit

-Kebab & Curry - great Indian food

-Achilles - great Mediterranean food

-A Slice of New York - awesome NY style pizza, their garlic knots are a must have, order extra",t2_1ke6u8pd,urvize,0,1631829024.0,0,t1_hd4sf9u,hd4sf9u,False,cinnamontacos,t3_pp9539,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/pp9539/kiely_blvd/,Kiely Blvd,/r/santaclara/comments/pp9539/kiely_blvd/hd4sf9u/,12,r/santaclara,0,12

"The condos I live in seem to be rented by people who know people. Nobody even puts any notices up in the laundry room anymore like they used to. 

People seem to have the best luck on next door.

I'll keep my eye open for you and I'll try to remember to send you a private message if I see anything.

I like this area quite a lot. It's not perfect we do get a lot of people that are not housed. Some of them like the guy that hung out side of my condos just keep to themselves mind their own business. Others are crack whores that just continually try to break into everything. My carport has been broken into three times. 

One guy was trying to break into the car next to mine and he just laughed at me and ran off. I called my HOA guy who ran after him. He wasn't caught he's a repeat offender but we did manage to catch another burglar where I live. Group effort.

We are across from Central Park. 

You can probably guess where we are but I'd rather you not say the name publicly. ;) Let's just say that if you walk straight across from Central Park into some condos not the ritzy ones but the old ones, you will run into this place.

"Best time lol. At the Santa Clara DMV, you make an appointment and show up on time, then they make you wait a minimum of 2 hours after your appointment time to actually get your test. Expect multiple DMV employees to insult you along the way. Don't ask any questions or they will insult and belittle you even more. Oh and the parking lot is always full. You'll need to park on the street. Make sure you're parked correctly because the police know that the DMV lot is always full so they always circle the area looking for easy tickets to hand out for parking violations.

Cynicism aside, I would guess the best time to do the ROAD test is between 11-3, when the roads are less crowded. So if you schedule an appointment for 11, you should be good even if they make you wait 2-3 hours.

"""everything else I typed is bs"" - ok, give me an example.

Men are on average taller than women. True, or bs?

Men are on average stronger than women. True, or bs?

Firefighting is a physically demanding job. True, or bs?

Let's take them one at a time. Height. Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average\_human\_height\_by\_country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_human_height_by_country) For the US, average male height is 5'9"". Average female height is 5'3.5"". Meaning, on average, men are taller than women.

Strength: Source, National Library of medicine ""[Gender differences in strength and muscle fiber characteristics](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8477683/)"". Conclusion: ""The women were approximately 52% and 66% as strong as the men in the upper and lower body respectively. The men were also stronger relative to lean body mass."" There are many other studies showing similar results. Meaning, on average, men are stronger than women.

Firefighting being physically demanding: Source, [FireRescue1 website](https://www.firerescue1.com/firefighter-training/articles/11-requirements-to-become-a-firefighter-FO0ZZpNdggP1GAmq/), a site about firefighting as a career. It says basic physical requirements are stair climb, hose drag, equipment carry, ladder raise / extension, forcible entry, search / rescue, ceiling breach, and pull. All of that is physically demanding. Meaning, firefighting is a physically demanding job.

Personally I don't care if a firefighter is male or female. I do care if they can carry / drag my unconscious body out of a dangerous situation. The amount of men who can do that is far larger than the amount of women who can. If a woman meets the requirements, great! Hire her! But don't lower the requirements one iota just to let more women artificially pass.

Sure, for any specific man, you can find a stronger woman, and for any specific woman, you can find a weaker man. But men are larger and stronger than women, on average. There's no right or wrong about it, that's just general reality.

"I've had both doses of pfizer, as have my husband, my daughter, my closest friend and her husband. I can tell you how it felt for us, but it doesn't mean you will have the same experience. I would just like to reassure you, if I can. 

Me: 1st dose - slight pain at the injection site, went away after 2 days; 2 dose - woke up the next day feeling crappy, with muscle and joint  ache, and even my skin felt sensitive. I took a couple of tylenols and the aches went away. I felt a bit tired so had a nap. The next day - back to normal.

My husband: 1st dose - same as me. 2nd dose - absolutely nothing, except a bit of pain at the injection site (when pressed)

My daughter: 1st dose - same as me and hubby; 2nd dose - woke up next day feeling tired; spent the day on the couch, watching the movies and napping. Next day - back to normal.

My best friend: 1st dose - same as me. 2nd dose - woke up with fever the next day. It went up and down, 102F was the highest. She had a headache and muscle and join pain, and tylenol did not help. Her fever lasted for 24-36 hours, after that it and all the other symptoms went away.

My best friend's husband: 1st dose - same as everyone else; 2nd dose - felt tired and cranky the day after he received the second dose, then the day after that he was perfectly fine.

Like I said, our experiences don't mean anything in the great scheme of things, but I hope they can help you not feeling scared. My best advice would be to schedule an easy stay-at home-day for yourself and you will be fine.

The most difficult thing, to me, is the traffic on game days and big concerts. My street is one of the ones that the police close off when games get out. I made the mistake of going to a grocery 3 minutes away during that window, and the 3 minute car ride took 40+ minutes because of detours.

A lot of people don't like paying for parking in the stadium so they park in nearby neighborhoods and walk to the stadium. It results in a lot of extra foot traffic on top of vehicle traffic.

Concerts can also cause similar annoyances. Beyonce coming to town creates a lot of car traffic, to the point where trying to go out at the same time the concert ends is basically impossible.

I've been trying to think about it from this rationale: ""The more people who get shots in their arms, the faster COVID-19 gets under control and the quicker we can 'return to normal'.""

However based on some light reading I have done, Levi Stadium is the largest vaccination hub in the South Bay and the governor’s office is very proud of that. I suspect Levi Stadium will remain a vaccine distribution center for several more weeks or months.

"My SO and I moved here from the Midwest about a year ago. One thing we noticed is that not many complexes have central air. It was weird to us that central air would not be standard. We found a nice complex that has central air, washer/dryer, gated and in a safe area. It is within waking distance of a lot of things and is close to the highway, but not too close. It is near the Santa Clara University. A two bed, two bath (I don't see a plan with 2 bed, 1 bath) starts at about $3500. I've never lived on the east coast, but my SO and I had to get used to the fact that this area is pretty expensive for the space you get. We looked at other places, the place we chose was only $150 more per month than the other places we looked at and had more amenities and a better location and separate washer/dryers (every other place had the stacked ones) so we ended up increasing our original budget for an apartment.  
Some things I have learned, be careful if you are looking near the San Jose airport. There are some unsafe areas around there and a pretty large homeless camp. I have also seen on reddit that there is a lot of noise if your place is near the airport and on a flight path. My current place is very close to the airport, but we got lucky and are not on a flight path.
I have also seen on Reddit that there is a lot of noise if the place you choose is right on the highway - late night street is a pretty big problem in some areas 
I moved here right when everything shut down due to the pandemic, so I cannot speak to the normal flow of traffic. My SO commuted to work two weeks before everything shut down and did not have any issues. He drove from Santa Clara to Sunnyvale.

"It varies. I'm not too far from where you'll be living and my AT&T gigabit fiber (through Sonic) is excellent. But I've known people in the bay area who have a really awful experience with AT&T Fiber: inconsistent speeds, packet loss, bad jitter, and high latency.

Another possibility is that your new place might not have working fiber. AT&T subcontracts out their fiber installation to companies who never actually test that it's working before a customer asks to get it set up. Which means that sometimes AT&T's website will say it's available but when a technician shows up to install they discover it's not working. Depending on the problem, in that scenario AT&T won't bother doing the additional labor to fix things for you.

I've drafted an email to the state and local health departments; hopefully OP will respond back confirming they will seek a permit.  I don't care to get anyone in trouble; but I do care to prevent trouble from unregulated food operations.

Edit: Furthermore, we are at the height of a fucking global pandemic, and on track to hit half a million dead in this country before it turns around.  Unlicensed, unregulated food preparation is exactly the kind of thing that shouldn't be operating under these conditions.  California has a pretty progressive Cottage Food Operation law (which many states do not), and all I ask is that that law be respected.

"I can't really say for sure. Frankly it seems like the university has a nice bubble, but the immediately surrounding area is pretty boring. There are a couple lively restaurants near the intersection of Park and The Alameda, but otherwise Santa Clara is a pretty quiet town. There are some nice businesses down the length of The Alameda, especially as you get closer to the intersection of Race St. and Downtown San Jose can be cool, and it's not too far away but it's far outside of walking distance, which would make it hard to have as a ""quick trip between classes"" type of thing.

I've gone to a couple community events at the university and the facilities seem nice, and the faculty I met (very limited sample) seemed nice and said good things about the university.

I see the frat bros playing beer pong in their front yards down Lafayette St on friday evenings. Seems like there are several pockets of heavy party culture there.

> On Wednesday morning, the wind shifted, now bringing ash from the rapidly growing Bear Fire near Chico down over the Bay Area. But at the same time, there's a marine layer that's protecting us, explains ABC7 News Meteorologist Mike Nicco.

> ""The marine layer is a stable area of air that does not rise, and so we're continually pumping in cleaner air from over the ocean,"" explains Nicco.
>
> That's why the sky is so dark, with a yellow or orange hue, but you may not smell smoke when you step outside.

...

> But here's the catch: ""In order for the marine layer to break, the sun has to actually heat the ground. If we don't get much sunshine, the marine layer will keep us cleaner longer.""",t2_bi95b,plush_bunny,0,1599712520.0,0,t1_g4mhd32,g4mhd32,True,Patri100ia,t3_ippvs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/ippvs8/why_is_it_so_dark_and_weirdly_colorful_but_we/,"Why is it so dark and weirdly colorful, but we can't smell smoke?",/r/santaclara/comments/ippvs8/why_is_it_so_dark_and_weirdly_colorful_but_we/g4mhd32/,2,r/santaclara,0,2

"The smoke is high in the atmosphere (between 2000 and 4000 feet). On the surface the air is clear(ish), but at higher altitudes the smoke is very thick.

The smoke scatters most wavelengths of light, which causes the sunlight to change colors.

Most of the smoke consists of very fine particles that can stay suspended at high altitudes for a while. Larger particles of ash, like ones that are easily visible will fall down to the surface quickly, so you might also notice ash has started to cover everything.

Eventually the fine smoke particles will fall down to the surface as well, but it's hard to predict when that will happen so the air will continue to stay (relatively) clean for a little until that happens.",t2_5ypdlmym,SpicyFarts1,0,1599705243.0,0,t1_g4m5xnk,g4m5xnk,True,Patri100ia,t3_ippvs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/ippvs8/why_is_it_so_dark_and_weirdly_colorful_but_we/,"Why is it so dark and weirdly colorful, but we can't smell smoke?",/r/santaclara/comments/ippvs8/why_is_it_so_dark_and_weirdly_colorful_but_we/g4m5xnk/,2,r/santaclara,0,2

"When you get Real Id you have two choices.  

One is to just add it to your current license and expiration date.  This kind of sucks to pay $30 to have real ID for a few months to 5 years.  You do have to take a new photo.

Second is to add Real ID and renew your license 6 month prior to your exp date which i was told it required taking the written test but it gives you 5 years of Real Id. This costs $37

I noticed you dropped 5 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

"I can somewhat answer this. I went to Santa Clara DMV last week because I bought a vehicle out of state. I did not do RealID, but others in line were there for that. 

I got there at 10a or so with no appointment and there was a small line outside (10 people?). It took maybe 30 minutes to get to the front of the line, I needed an additional form and was told to fill it out in the car and come back to the appointment line. Others with RealID were forced to show all documents **PRINTED** at the door. With my form filled, I was allowed inside for a number within 10 minutes using the nearly empty appointment line.

Once inside with my number, it took maybe 45 minutes to be called to the desk to complete my task. Total time: approx 2 hours. I was out in time for lunch.

If you needed to do a RealID, I'd say maybe 2.5 - 3 hours as I saw there was a small backup (~8 people) of people waiting for pictures.

Bonus: **WEAR A MASK**. The WHOLE time. Some dude got the boot after repeated warnings that the mask is to stay ON.",t2_9h8my,robo_cap,0,1594760055.0,0,t1_fy2qyhl,fy2qyhl,True,Pizzasaurus_,t3_hr70rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/hr70rw/dmv_timings_for_covid/,DMV Timings for Covid,/r/santaclara/comments/hr70rw/dmv_timings_for_covid/fy2qyhl/,0,r/santaclara,0,0

"I went on Thursday for my Realid at the Flora Vista location!  I was in and out in less than 15 minutes.  If you upload your documents online, you can take the printout they provide you and just go right to the appt window without actually having to make an appointment.  Just make sure to also bring your originals with you as they WILL need them.  Literally the quickest experience I've ever had at the DMV.  I got there at 11:45.  After checking in ~2 minutes (I was 2nd person in the appt line), I waited for about 3 minutes inside before they called me up to check documents, pay, and have my picture taken.  I was out the door at noon.

The non-appointment line had a ton of folks (and at least two of them asking to talk to managers about how long it was taking) so I recommend you do the uploading-documents online route for sure.",t2_13j19a,beephstewart,0,1594753101.0,0,t1_fy2cdxy,fy2cdxy,True,Pizzasaurus_,t3_hr70rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/hr70rw/dmv_timings_for_covid/,DMV Timings for Covid,/r/santaclara/comments/hr70rw/dmv_timings_for_covid/fy2cdxy/,1,r/santaclara,0,1

"That's a good plan.

OC is one the counties that the governor ordered all restaurants, bars, gyms to close for the next three weeks. Take-out only. There are spikes up and down CA, the situation in SoCal is concerning. Family gatherings and parties are now a major source of outbreak. If you do decide to attend, please take precautions even with family members, especially those who you may not have seen in a while. Masks and social distancing are not foolproof. After the wedding, you guys may consider getting tested just for a peace of mine.

My cousin is getting married in August. Too many relatives need to fly in, including elderly folks. She decides to hold a small ceremony (<10 people) instead, and postpones the reception to next year.

Edit: I mis-read your post, my bad. You were asking about Santa Clara. Here we are a tad better than OC. More compliance re: masks and social distancing.

"Is the reception indoor or outdoor? Will there be dancing on the floor? 

Even if there is social distancing in place, personally I think indoor dining is still problematic because of the circulation of air. Outdoor will be more ventilated so the risks are lower.

Don't know how feasible it is to wear a mask and dance at the same time. People will ditch their masks pretty quickly and social distancing will be difficult toU maintain.",t2_65m3li04,MBB209,0,1593719145.0,0,t1_fwqccvm,fwqccvm,True,[deleted],t3_hk3elt,https://www.reddit.com/r/santaclara/comments/hk3elt/question_regarding_a_wedding/,Question regarding a wedding,/r/santaclara/comments/hk3elt/question_regarding_a_wedding/fwqccvm/,3,r/santaclara,0,3

"I don't think Newsom's order really changes life for us much, as we've not opened for indoor dining yet anyway.

Newsom's order definitely does not stop restaurants from doing take out/delivery - only indoor dining is affected.  I doubt that will ever happen.
