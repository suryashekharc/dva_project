"The pay and benefits are good.  You lose a bit on hourly wage, but that's because they give you a crap ton of vacation, time off, and fringe benefits.  You get 3 weeks paid vacation, 10 caregiver days, 5 personal holidays, a week of sick time, 1 wellness day, and the option to purchase up to four weeks additional vacation.  It's insane.

A lot of the work is very compartmentalized from what I have seen-a lot of redundancy.  Department to department can vary, but over all it's a pretty healthy work environment and you can escalate issues as far up as you need to.  I've been fortunate to only work under nice people, for the most part.

It can be hard to be directly hired in so you might have to come in through a contractor.  Aerotek is paid more than Manpower.  Right now is a good time for it as they're hiring pretty heavily, but don't be surprised if it takes a bit either.  

So if you need insurance, look elsewhere for a direct hire-I knew I had my job for a year before it finally was made official and I was hired, for example.

"The last half of the second paragraph makes my blood boil. That’s sitcom parody stuff right there. The employees were expected to sacrifice their time and potential long term health during the pandemic, and what they did was admirable - I know I appreciate getting the vaccine.

"I used to work here. I was about 5-6 months pregnant at the time, and absolutely zero accommodations were made so i could properly sit down at any point and rest my swollen feet during my 6 hour shifts, even though i had showed management a letter from my doctors stating i should not be on my feet for more than 4 hours at a time without some sort of break. (I was initially told i would be able to rest in 5-10 minute intervals as needed)and i was absolutely lucky if i could have the tiniest bite of food any time in my shift, I literally had to wolf it down while crouching below the bar and hope no one saw me. in addition i can say that they were awful about staffing and we were consistently short staffed, so that made it so you were expected to do 2 peoples jobs at once. I also had to remind them to give me my pay bump, instead of it being automatically implemented.Good for everyone on this strike, i hope it changes for the better. Much love.(As an edit, I understand a lot of this was not the direct managements fault, as well as i have to mention my coworkers were lovely, but higher management should have had some foresight into these issues and made it so that everyone, managers included weren’t being overworked to the bone, so that individual coworkers needs were being addressed and met, i feel like no one had time for anything ever)",t2_758z9kwj,aacidentalaaderall,0,1648806364.0,0,t1_i2ypela,i2ypela,True,ColdPhone,t3_tsxdu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/tsxdu8/employees_strike_at_maru_sushi_in_kalamazoo/,Employees strike at Maru Sushi in Kalamazoo,/r/kzoo/comments/tsxdu8/employees_strike_at_maru_sushi_in_kalamazoo/i2ypela/,7,r/kzoo,0,7

"The shit they sell from big chocolate isn't even chocolate. 

White chocolate, from big brands, is actually a petroleum byproduct. 

The cacao content in Hershey's or Snickers is practically nothing. It's all sugar. 

Then the sourcing and labor standards are the next topic. It is historically sourced by big chocolate brands in impoverished nations with, at times, literal slave and child labor. 

All quality chocolate from real cacao beans that are sourced from not sketchy places are going to cost about as much as this costs. I've paid even more - like $15 for the same size bars....

I've actually done a cacao farm tour, and tasting event. So like.... It's actually like wine to me now. Or beer. Or coffee. These are fine products that can have wildly different flavor profiles, texture and mouth feel.

"TL/DR: Crazy what things cost when you pay cacao farmers a living wage and don't support child slave labor.



Haha. I don't typically get people who buy a pound of chocolate. Most bars in the craft chocolate industry are 1.7 to 2.3 ounces and sell for $12 to $15. My bars are 2.7oz and sell for $9 and $11.

The other thing to note is you cant compare the price of wine to grape juice. Hersheys and EVERY other big chocolate company are buying unfermented cacao harvested with child slave labor in Ghana. They hide the shitty beans by roasting the shit out of them. Then they smother it in vanilla and tell you ""tHiS iS cHoCoLaTe"" when in fact it not only doesn't taste like chocolate, the reason it's cheap is because it's only 10% cacao and the 10% that's in there is from child slaves.

So that's the story. I don't charge $11 because I want to, I charge $11 because with a modest food industry average margin of 40%, that's what it sells for.",t2_3p4mldlu,cptierney6,0,1648689444.0,0,t1_i2si4gk,i2si4gk,False,butters266,t3_tsdql8,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/tsdql8/responsibly_sourced_and_locally_made_from_a_wmu/,Responsibly sourced and locally made from a WMU alumni!

"**[Eternal September](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)** 
 
 >Eternal September or the September that never ended is Usenet slang for a period beginning around 1993 when Internet service providers including Delphi began offering Usenet access to many new users. The flood of new users overwhelmed the existing culture for online forums and the ability to enforce existing norms. AOL followed with their Usenet gateway service in March, 1994. Since then, the popularity of the Internet has led to a constant stream of new users.

Waldo's are pretty good..the Chipotle garlic sauce is really delicious....and it's great kind of dive bar to suck back a few cheap beers as well.  

In a really odd place to find wings, Rice Kitchen actually has really good wings.  They're not Buffalo wings....they're breaded.  There's an option for Spicy which is a spicy asian sauce, not a Buffalo sauce...still really good and fairly cheap if I remember right.  

Burdick's are really good but also really expensive.  I love Old Burdick's but it's just gotten so expensive to eat there.

"It's one of the most unbiased approached videos I've seen on the topic tbh. It's worth a chance if you ever have time, but I do get that. 

Here are some sources: 
1. Congressional research report covering wage trends from 1979-2019. https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/details?prodcode=R45090

2. Declining worker power hypothesis: basically discusses how a lot of these trends are associated with less collective organizing by workers. https://www.nber.org/papers/w27193 

3. Paper on inequality in benefits packages that compounds wage inequality and stagnation. https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122420912505

And here are ones I found regarding data during the pandemic, while the mechanics have changed in that low-income workers are receiving the highest wage increase right now, they are also receiving the highest cost-of-living increases and being affected the most by inflation. Likely due to most of us having to rent and being at the mercy of these increases, not having stable assets. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/fortune.com/2021/12/10/inflation-wages-low-income-workers/amp/
https://budgetmodel.wharton.upenn.edu/issues/2022/2/21/did-wages-keep-up-with-inflation-in-2021
https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/us-wages-grew-fastest-pace-decades-2021-prices-grew-even-more

So the trend seems to remains the same, any gains made by the lowest earners come with offsets like rent increases, inflation, and changes to benefit packages, whereas those earning a more comfortable living have seen real-wage increases or stability for a few decades, but are now being negatively affected by inflation.",t2_oqe8l,tbostick99,0,1648671446.0,0,t1_i2rcs5x,i2rcs5x,False,tbostick99,t3_tqdaml,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/tqdaml/rent_prices/,Rent Prices?,/r/kzoo/comments/tqdaml/rent_prices/i2rcs5x/,3,r/kzoo,0,3

"When the company that did the reconcile for missed time punches due to this Kronos outage, there are a lot of people that were not compensated correctly.

If you were on sick time due to covid, vacation time, or any other reason to be gone that would normally be compensated for, they say that they overpaid you for that time period and you owe money back.

"Used to work there as a sushi chef for years. The owner is an Elon Musk wannabe who treats his workers like dogs and moonlights as a coke fiend. Most upper management is the same. Just a bunch of rich assholes who have no concept of the hardships their workers go through. 

A few years back, I remember someone from upper management needed brain surgery. Twice. They made her use all of her vacation days for it AND they put her back to work only a few days later after the second surgery. Motherfucking BRAIN SURGERY. She quit shortly after, but holy shit, that was so insane to me. They were literally willing to work this person to death.

Besides that, I had multiple instances of getting sexually harassed, getting called a f#&$ot by the old BOH chef (who was later fired for sexual harassment amongst other things), and just generally getting treated like shit and worked to the bone.

I obviously don't work there anymore and can't speak on how everyone is currently being treated, but this strike is not surprising to me at all.

We wrote a letter to upper management as a group of about 20 unsatisfied workers and sent it to them on Friday 3/25 with a request to have a response and full staff meeting by 4pm Sunday 3/27 or we would all likely quit and find other work.  

We didn't receive a response by the aforementioned time and proceeded to walk out as a whole and causing the store to shut down for Sunday (after 4pm, at about 4:13 to be precise, we did receive an email as a whole that our grievances we're heard and that the problems would be resolved in the upcoming months, which we all decided was not satisfactory as we have been being told this for about 7 months already and we responded with an email stating that we were officially on strike and withholding labor until there was an all-staff meeting with corporate, which we said virtually would suffice)  and Monday as well, and on that day we went and picketed from 4pm-7pm.

When you go, the immediate rules literally laid out in front of you are that you are participating in a ""crowdsourced fundraising social experiment"", which is basically fancy talk for "" illegal in-house restaurant operating without a food and business license"".

"Check Redfin, MLS or Zillow.

There are houses starting at $41,000 in Kalamazoo. Outside of Michigan and like……extremely impoverished areas in the southern US states like Alabama, Louisiana or Mississippi; prices this low are unheard of. 

People will often comment that these homes are not in their desired neighborhoods, school districts, etc. I will agree that location does influence property values - quite significantly, even. Location preferences aside; housing is ridiculously cheap here. Like this place is only $60k. 3 bed/1 bath isn’t what a lot of people prefer - but the location of the property is pretty good. 

Hell - there is a 120k home in Portage right now with a great location; if someone insists on Portage schools.

"Here? Lol it's so white

I've visited most states, lived in more than one. Everything is WAYYYYY too sweet and the quality is very poor here. We just stopped eating out and rarely eat meat to compensate.

This isn't a ""personal preference"" either. Factually, Americans have less access to quality food and it is more expensive, because it isn't subsidized like Europe. One of the many reasons America struggles with poor health. Meat here is very very poor. You can get okay stuff, but it is very very expensive. We had one decent steak (literally one, I had fish) in Iowa at a nice steak house. Thewal was $200 for two, no alcohol. Same standard as a £20 steak at home. Again, you can look upeat quality facts.

Now, if your preference is American, because you grew up with it, that is fine. My husband is American, lived outside of America for a while, UK for a year and he doesn't like most American foods anymore either. Tbf though, we have an Italian chef in the family, and, other than my mother, everyone is a good cook. So we were spoiled before.

My dad worked for coke for almost 40 years. He worked for the one in Kalamazoo for most of his career until they shut the plant down and moved to grand rapids. Now I believe they are talking about shutting the grand rapids one down too. He is now retired but he said it was a good place to work and made a lot of friends. It's also demanding on the body though he was a warehouse worker and lifted soda pallets and operated forklifts.

The Air Zoo is truly one of my favorite places in SWMI. Arrive any time and have a great time! The simulators are still closed (stupid Covid) but everything else including the kids room is open now. I’ve been taking my kids since they were toddlers. It is very friendly for kids- not a “velvet ropes don’t touch anything” kinda place. The volunteers there are super nice and will offer free tours and are crazy knowledgeable. The other building is worth a stop too to see even more planes and the restoration work. The folks that work on the restorations are retired military typically and super sweet. Some of the guys are in their 80s and 90s and will answer any question you have about old planes. The food upstairs in the main building is pretty good- it’s run by Millennium. The cookies are especially good.,t2_ewegknc0,CantaloupePurple2289,0,1648172699.0,0,t1_i20f9n8,i20f9n8,True,cinnabunny88,t3_tn6ajv,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/tn6ajv/anybody_been_to_the_airzoo/,Anybody been to the airzoo?,/r/kzoo/comments/tn6ajv/anybody_been_to_the_airzoo/i20f9n8/,2,r/kzoo,0,2

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

"Oh, well that's good to know! Most of the things on my Avoid list are from what I've seen others say on reviews and other reddit posts (as I said before, Candlewyck is the only one I have personal experience from) so they might not all be terrible, that's just what I've been told.

Another thing to keep in mind though is that things can change with a company/apartment complex pretty quickly. Right now I live at Candlewyck. I've lived here for 6 years and for those first 4 years I would have been more than happy to recommend others to live there. It wasn't perfect, but it felt comfortable and quiet and safe, and for the most part I trusted the people working in the office. Over these past 2 years though things went sharply downhill. It's no longer safe, things are being broken and destroyed all around the property and inside the buildings, there is trash everywhere, they can't keep up with basic maintenance tasks, and they can't keep a manager to save their lives (I left a proper and very lengthy review on google lol). The managers just keep quitting over and over and over again. I don't even have somewhere lined up to move yet, but all I know is that I need to get away from here as fast as possible. So if it's been a couple years since you've lived at any of those places, things could be very different now. Ooor the reviews/advice I read could have been from just an unlucky tenant in an unlucky spot at their apartment complex.

"Many of these items are already in place, so they should theoretically have no cost associated with them.

If you compare this initiative with the ""Secure MI Vote"" petition, it would incur numerous additional expenditures and has no clear method of paying for them (which is the point -- they seek to burden local clerks of court with undue restrictions and generally hamper voters ability to cast their ballots).

- Military and Overseas ballots are currently sent to overseas voters, and the Secure MI Vote petition seeks to change the state constitution so that they are only counted if they are *received* by election day. Protect the Vote 2022 seeks to ensure that as long as these ballots are postmarked by the election day and received within 6 days of the election, they are counted. This is a zero cost initiative, if the Secure MI vote petition gets its way, it would hamper voters from casting their ballot by restricting the dates in which a valid vote can be cast.
- Michigan __already allows__ voters to voluntarily show ID or sign an affidavit to their identity (voter ID is not required). The Secure MI Vote petition wants ID, specifically a state drivers license, in order for voters to cast a ballot.
- Michigan currently maintains a permanent absentee ballot list. This means the state sends you an absentee ballot application for each election in order for you to request an absentee ballot. 
**IMPORTANT TO NOTE:** Absentee ballots are not automatically sent to you! The Secure MI Vote petitioners incorrectly assert that absentee ballots are automatically sent (and that this contributes to widespread voter fraud) -- both of those assertions are incorrect. The Secure MI Vote petition would remove the ability for voters to be on the permanent absentee ballot list, in addition to making requesting an absentee ballot much more difficult (you have to send a photo copy of your drivers license IN THE MAIL with your application for each election!)
- State funded postage is new. Currently they send out applications / ballots and we have to provide the return stamp. The good news is that ""business reply"" rates are published and for large organizations like the state government should be relatively affordable. The petition does not specify how this would be funded, but it does provide that local election offices can use charitable contributions (which must be disclosed) to fund these initiatives. An important thing to note is that the Secure MI Vote petition would set forth numerous restrictions on local election clerks WITHOUT PROVIDING ANY FUNDING RECOURSE for those to be enacted.

Do I need to show identification in order to vote?

“Michigan does have a voter identification requirement at the polls. Voters are asked to present an acceptable photo ID such as a Michigan driver's license or identification card. Please note that voters who do not have an acceptable form of ID or failed to bring it with them to the polls still can vote. They simply sign a brief affidavit stating that they're not in possession of a photo ID. Their ballots are included with all others and counted on Election Day.” 

Your vote is counted in Michigan whether you have ID or not.

"More info:  Promote the Vote 2022 is a pro-voter initiative to enshrine and expand voting rights into the state constitution.  Voters not Politicians, the group that did the campaign to stop gerrymandering in Michigan by creating an independent redistricting commission, is collecting signatures to get this on the ballot, in a coalition with the League of Women Voters, the ACLU of Michigan and some smaller organizations.  We need 425K signatures by the end of June, so if you support things like having 9 days of early, in person voting in Michigan, online absentee ballot tracking, postage paid absentee ballots, and other things, please sign so we can get this on the Nov. ballot.",t2_3v7pzyby,ComplexTailor,0,1648053305.0,0,t1_i1tbby2,i1tbby2,True,ComplexTailor,t3_tkzhfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/kzoo/comments/tkzhfh/volunteers_now_circulating_promote_the_vote_2022/,"Volunteers now circulating ""Promote the Vote 2022"" in Kalamazoo.

"Julie agonized about closing Food Dance and support from the community drove her to reopen. You can see at propublica exactly how much money they took from PPP.

She's been running the place for a long time and I for one am glad that it isn't going to become another Millenium Group restaurant.
