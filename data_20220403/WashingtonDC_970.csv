"I emailed our bobbing circuit guru, and he's aware of the issue here.  I also looked at the track plans and see there are several ""Cleveland Fixes"" in this area.  So the current imbalance that is the root cause of the bobbing circuit has evidently been a problem in this area for a while.  There is a plan in place to replace running rail so the two running rails have better match electrical characteristics.  Leaving U St, the track has a curve and goes up a hill.  The curve means the outside running rail wears much more quickly than the inner running rail.  The outside running rail has been replaced with newer rail, while the inner rail is probably the original rail when this section was built.  The original running rails are no longer manufactured and the newer running rails have higher electrical resistance.  At first, it doesn't seem like the resistance is that much higher, but when there are thousands of amps flowing, it can make a large enough difference to cause problems.  I will ask on Monday if anyone knows if this running rail replacement is on the schedule.

"You’re racist because you’re pissed that someone is proposing to help black people. Nobody said anything about NOT helping anybody else, but just the thought of help for black people made you apparently furious. 

You’re ignorant because you have no idea what you’re talking about, as the HPAP program already exists, yet you’ve been crying about a way to make sure money is made expressly available for black families. Raising the means test isn’t the issue. These families are already eligible. Black families are disproportionately underrepresented as recipients of these benefits.

Moreover, in the same announcement of this fund, DC announced: Expanding HPAP with ~$3M, increasing the HPAP assistance to 200K, providing legal services to help families keep properties through probate, limiting property taxes on seniors, increasing funds for low income residents to repair and future-proof their homes.

"What's going on is that there is a track circuit that bobs when the train starts to accelerate to leave U Street.  The reason why is that there is a current imbalance there due to the curve and mismatched running rails.  The imbalanced current will flow through the track circuit bonds in order to even out the current in the running rails.  If the current going through the bond gets high enough, it will detune the bond causing the track circuit to drop.  Detuning the bond means the frequency the bond is supposed to be is shifted, so it no longer matches the track circuit frequency.  When it no longer matches, the signal does not pass through the bond and the track circuit drops, which means it indicates it is occupied by a train.

For the train accelerating from the U St platform, what it experiences is that everything is fine and it has speed commands allowing the train to proceed.  Once the train accelerates enough to ""bob"" the circuit ahead of it, the ATC system acts as though that bobbed track circuit actually has a train in it.  So the speed commands are taken away from the train leaving the U St platform.  This means the operator has to put the throttle in the brake position until the train stops or the speed commands come back.  Even though the trains aren't in ATO, the operators still have to follow the speed commands.  If the operator goes faster than the speed command, the train applies the brakes until it comes to a complete stop. The reason the operator cannot just accelerate slowly is that there is a hill when leaving the U St platform.  The train has to accelerate fast enough to get up the hill, but not too fast to bob the track circuit.  Depending on all the physical factors, grade of the hill, size of the current imbalance in the rails, etc, this may be extremely difficult or impossible for operators to pull off.  On a flat surface it would probably be relatively simple for an operator to accelerate at P1 (lowest throttle setting) and avoid pulling enough current to bob the circuit.

This area has clearly been a problem, as there are several ""Cleveland Fixes"".  A Cleveland fix is where they put an insulated joint in the running rails and then attach left rail to right rail and right rail to left rail across the insulated joint with very large cables.  These are installed in an attempt to balance the current.  Over the years though, the original track circuits were replaced with newer track circuits that unfortunately have a lower tolerance for current imbalance.  On top of this, the outer running rail has been replaced with newer rails that have increased wear resistance and increased electrical resistance compared to the original running rails.  The inner running rail is likely the original running rail, which hasn't been manufactured in decades.

"I would not worry one bit about things being closed for Independence Day. On the contrary, the city will be a mad house — it’s the busiest tourist weekend of the year.

If you do decide to go to the fireworks, make sure you have a plan (and a _lot_ of patience) to get home via Metro. The bridges to Virginia are closed to traffic on 7/4, so this will be your only way home. 

To your Metro question, I’ve lived in the city for 12 years and have never once bought an unlimited pass.

"It's because the building was designated a protected historical structure/site, and as such you aren't allowed to change anything from its original design.  So any work you do on the building must result in the repair work matching the rest of the materials etc exactly.

Thing is, it's a giant exposed concrete structure... which used stone from a particular quarry/source which literally doesn't exist anymore.  It all got harvested and is just gone.  

So... how do you replace something exactly, when it's original material doesn't exist anymore?  Uh... you don't.   Lol.  Basicslly they have to find a somewhat similar material from wherever on earth they can find it, and modify it however necessary with pigments or whatever to make it end up matching.

The cost of doing this kind of thing is extreme, so much so that it just isn't feasible.  So they don't do any work to the building that isn't 100% necessary to keep it from collapsing.

There was a major renovation project done to this complex awhile back, and it was so complex/involved/pain in the dick, that it ended up being a subject of study far and wide in the engineering/construction world.  I sat through some talks about it, but it was awhile back and I don't remember most of it unfortunately.   Just that working on it is basically the most nightmarish of nightmare jobs that we deal with in this industry.

I know we're mostly talking about power washing or something,  but the fact is it just isn't worth doing anything because of a high chance of that action leading to/triggering other expensive things inadvertently.

"If you have a car, Luming’s in Fort Washington or Kababayan in Woodbridge. (The latter has sisig but sells out if you get there too late in the day. Both are turo-turo style.)

Kababayan has lechon but as someone else also recommended, definitely check out Kuya Ja in Rockville. Amazing lechon, too, and also has sisig (but imo less variety than Luming’s or Kababayan… like you can reliably get binagoongan at these two. I really love Kababayan’s sinigang and Luming’s has ginataang langka or banana heart, forgot which and I haven’t been back in a while due to distance).

Manila Oriental Market in Springfield also has an eatery in the back you can buy from, but I haven’t been back in a while. But I hear they have great halo-halo!

Also to add in regards to sisig: to echo others here, Purple Patch does have really delicious sisig. My mother was just saying to me last week that she was craving it. But—and I’m not sure how much traditional is at play here in your ask—Purple Patch and Kuya Ja use only pork belly for the sisig. Kababayan also uses snout and ears, if I’m not mistaken.

"DC has the Home Purchase Assistance Program which gives anyone up to $84,000 depending on income and family size, (,DC Cops, Firemen and Teachers get an additional $20,000 regardless of income level) and DC Housing Finance has DC Open Doors which gives the 3 or 3.5% down payment required with a much higher income ceiling. 

These are just two of the more well-known programs. 

Sauce - I've been doing mortgage finance in DC for 10 years with a focus on down payment assistance. I've helped folks of all types. 

Pro-tip, you can combine the above two programs.  Most lenders don't want to deal with these programs because frankly they are a pain in the ass if you don't know what you're doing (lender - not borrower).

"I’m not going to get into your abstract about the personality traits of rich students at various universities.  I didn’t go to these schools, presumably you didn’t go to all of them either, so this is just some guessing expedition mixed in with scuttlebutt and anecdotal experience; none of it helpful to OP’s original query.

Not all the schools you listed are peer schools.  I don’t consider attending a state flagship, much less one with 50-thousand plus students, to be the traditional college experience.You have a defined criteria for the traditional college experience.  You like basketball/football or both and good college bars.  So do I.  Even played a sport to boot.  My wife could not care less about either.

OP needs to decide what they want.  Urban or not, big school or not.  Boston is a great college city but it isn’t because anyone is watching Harvard v. Princeton.  Georgetown obviously has a more typical campus, which not all urban universities do.  Universities within larger cities provide both advantages and disadvantages just as universities within college towns provide both advantages and disadvantages.

Lastly, I can’t tell you three good college bars as I did not attend university in DC.  Having lived in NW, I know the tombs is a thing.  Regardless, the last thing any applicant should do is pick a university based on the collegiate bar scene.  And if Durham and Ithaca are any indication, that bar scene ain’t what it used to be, even in places that you might consider more traditional college experiences.",t2_fde2dl6i,mmdotmm,0,1648944333.0,0,t1_i362htm,i362htm,False,RainbowUnicorn2912,t3_tufsdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/tufsdk/is_dc_a_good_college_city/,Is DC a good college city?,/r/washingtondc/comments/tufsdk/is_dc_a_good_college_city/i362htm/,2,r/washingtondc,0,2

"Our family (2 kids of 13 and 8) will be heading over to DC between 7/2 and 7/6, booked air fare and a hotel near the airport, and it looks to be fairly close to the Pentagon City and Crystal City Metro stations.

Been reviewing what to do and I'm absolutely overwhelmed with all the activities and sites to see, that I don't even know where to start to be honest.  We plan to use the metro exclusively, and we aren't afraid to walk (we are theme park pros!), but this leads to my first question.

We are going to be there 4 days, does it make sense to buy the 3 day unlimited Metro pass, plus another 1 day unlimited pass, or do I go with the 7 short-trip unlimited pass?  Or do I just pay each fare on demand?  I want to maximize the use of the cards, value-wise, but don't want to leave too much money on the cards when we leave.  The fare cost structure seems complicated to someone that has never seen it before.

Another wrinkle is, that since we are going for the 7/4 holiday weekend, I'm assuming some things may be closed for the holiday and because maybe there are other activities happening around.  What are the best activities that occur for independence day?

"I’m not skeptical about the hurdles black Americans face, those are well understood. I am very skeptical about how giving money to a specific race - regardless of past injustices or not - is ok or is not racist itself. DC has had black leadership for decades, a majority (or very close to) black population for decades and massive social spending programs ranging from affordable housing, food stamps, unemployment, etc etc, yet there is still massive poverty, crime, unemployment and other social problems. I fail to see how more subsidies “solves” the problem. My view is that the injustices are real and the real talk is, millions of immigrants have come to this country every year for the opportunity - not because we’re perfect or have no racial bias or problems but because it’s the best place on earth to work hard and get ahead. I fail to see how giving  people money is just or fair. I also believe the entire notion that gentrification has ruined DC or made it worse for black people is racist. It’s driven a massive tax base that’s been used almost entirely to enrich the city with new schools, social spending and so on. It’s not perfect, Americas history isn’t perfect but it’s 2022 and no one race deserves the government to give them other peoples tax money, and I argue further that endless social support doesn’t solve the problem.

"Your post (and perhaps others in this thread) seem to imply that there were many Black people who were not touched by discrimination, or that once those policies ended they did not affect future generations.

Tens of millions of people, including my own aunts, went to segregated underfunded schools. The university system in my home state didn't begin accepting Black students until my grandmother was almost 15 years out of high school. Over a million Black veterans served in WW2, and hardly any of them were able to take advantage of all of the GI Bill benefits that helped fuel the explosive rise of the White middle class in the late 40s and 50s (and echoes today).

Even if someone defied the odds, they were still banned from buying homes in many neighborhoods, which combined with redlining, limited the ability of a family to build wealth through home ownership and pass that wealth to their children.

And that's before we get to the ""original sin"" and the after effects of that.

The point is, if one got into Georgetown and wants a similarly ranked school, there are very few options if one also wants big D1 sports. You’re not going to Dartmouth for their lacrosse. 

The real question comes down to whether OP wants an urban-like campus or not. Is it Ithaca/Evanston or Nashville/DC. The Georgetown bar scene really is no more, but it hasn’t disappeared.

"I completely understand this argument, and to go further, it's easy enough to see that when black people were specifically targeted to either be kept poor or put into predatory situations, the long term knock-on effects of this are pretty substantial. So if the targeted culling was specific, why can't the stimulus? 

In some cases, it can be, I think. If you can prove that you were directly impacted by a racially oppressive policy in the past, it makes sense that you individually get restitution for it to make up for the economic impact. 

If you can't prove it though, it becomes really unclear how just it would be to make a racially based equity program that excludes poor people of other races/skin colors. 

So the inevitable conclusion here is to have the programs be titled for certain groups, but actually accept all peoples under certain threshold targets.

Yesterday, on April 1st, they opened reservations for the first time since pre-COVID for their first seatings in May.

">Ok but maybe they see it as there way out of the city? It’s not exactly elderly friendly, living in DC, 

This is just a laughable statement.  My wife works in mobility for the elderly. The city, DC especially, is by an unbelievable margin the best place to live as an elderly person.

If you live in the suburbs or god forbid a rural area, once you age out of driving you are *screwed.* Most rural areas have no public transit at all, no delivery services for food or groceries at all, no paratransit at all, and abysmal ambulance response times. You think DC isn't wheelchair accessible? Try living somewhere that doesn't even have sidewalks much less sidewalks with wheelchair ramps on every corner like DC does. 

Suburbs are a little better especially the more expensive DC ones but in lower cost of living areas you may get a bus but you're lucky if it comes once an hour. You may be able to get Instacart to deliver your groceries but now you're paying a huge markup every time. 

In DC you've got Metro and MetroAccess, you've got grocery stores, drugstores, and restaurants that deliver for no fee at no markup, you've got discounted property taxes, you've got walkability, you've got fast responses from ambulances with small or no copays.

"""Diversity"" does not mean tailoring policies to have the same racial makeup in every community. 

""Diversity"" is more about recognizing, celebrating, and growing together from our diverse backgrounds and experiences. I don't know how aiming for every community to be White: 60.1% (Non-Hispanic), Hispanic: 18.5%, Black: 12.2%, Asian: 5.6%, and Multiple Races: 2.8% is even remotely related to diversity. 

It sounds like it would end with every community across the US being the same shitty hodgepodge of lowest common denominator chain stores and restaurants. 

There are some damn good El Salvadoran restaurants in El Salvadoran neighborhoods that never could exist in a boring suburb. There are incredible music scenes in black neighborhoods that would never be found next to an Olive Garden.

If you don’t like spicy, then they also have chicken momos but the chili chicken momos are the ultimate. Also love their lo mein, which I prefer over any I’ve ever had at a Chinese restaurant. There’s an eating area but it’s nothing to write home about. Definitely call ahead to see if you need to put in your order as it can sometimes be as long as 45 minutes since they make their food to order.

"I went to GWU and been around to the other DC schools including GU. The sense of community is a bit less compared to a school that's located outside urban areas mainly because there isn't like an actual campus if that makes sense (at least at GWU). It's just a number of university related buildings located in the city but nearby each other so that it's like a hub but not necessarily a campus. Walking around campus you'll bump into lots of full-time workers, residents in the area, and maybe even politicians versus a state school with an actual campus - it's all students and school staff members. Like JMU or VT, there's not a whole lot of bars and retail outside of campus, everyone kind of just hangs out with each other so I feel like the college experience is richer at those types of schools.  


Just depends on what you're looking for. I will say though that by going to school in the city, you'll have a lot of internship and job opportunities. Look at the resume or LinkedIn of kids who went to school in city - you'll see a lot more stacked experience. That was definitely my case and it certainly paid off once I got out of school with full-time opportunities and $$$.

"Now, getting to this question.  There was a definite negative consequence to the white flight because cities lost a substantial portion of the tax base and didn't know how to handle it.  On the gentrification front, it's mixed.  If someone has owned their homes for a long time and decides to sell to a developer, they made a lot of money when they sold.  That was a choice they made. The new people moving in may be a different race, but that's not a bad thing.  A demographically diverse neighborhood doesn't just mean no white people live there.  They have to be diverse.
