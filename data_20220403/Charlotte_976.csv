"> There are no poisonous snakes at all. Period. End of story.

This is not an accurate statement.

Certain garter snakes can be poisonous due to their diet, and of course, we now know that garter snakes are venomous, albeit not medically significant to humans. 

But of course, most famously, *Rhabdophis tigrinus* are both venomous and poisonous.  These snakes have a separate gland from their venomous gland which secrets a toxin, which is even passed on to their offspring at birth.  While adult snakes gain their poisonous toxins from eating toads, their offspring are born with it.  Eating this snake will *poison* you.",t2_xork8,mjedmazga,0,1649009516.0,0,t1_i391rjj,i391rjj,False,IGuessIamYouThen,t3_tvaehw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/tvaehw/what_kind_of_snake_is_this_i_can_see_some_faint/,What kind of Snake is this?

"Your ‚Äúsolution‚Äù only works for some people is what I‚Äôm trying to say. I think that is a great OPTION for people to save money. Some people don‚Äôt feel safe living with other people and that is the reason you will never be able to convince everyone struggling financially to find a roommate. You cannot force your ideologies about living situations on other people. This isn‚Äôt something you have the power to influence. You‚Äôre never going to be able to vote on making people get roommates. You can vote on city budgets and where money is allocated. You can write letters to municipalities about livable wages. People can collectively go on strike if they aren‚Äôt being paid a livable wage. It sounds like you‚Äôre trying to put the blame on poor people.

"Your landlord should cover most pest control needs. To make your apartment less hospitable for roaches, there are a few things you can do.

The biggest is to clean. Roaches love sweet, oily, and protein-rich stuff. Even little stains, crumbs, and greasy spots. Clean them up.

Some sort of poison bait is also helpful. Harris Roach tablets work well. They are boric-acid based, which is less dangerous for humans and pets. Bayer also makes a combination ant and roach bait called Maxforce Complete Granular Bait. I get mine from domyown.com.

"If you're a young couple and you're looking for nightlife, sports, concerts, and a bustling city life, then you need to be in or near Charlotte. South End is a little pricey to live in, so depending on how good your jobs are, you may have a commute. If work is along Charlotte's light rail line, then try to find a home that's near the light rail--either within walking distance, or near a (free) parking garage for the rail.

Ashville or Hendersonville are where you should go if you are the outdoorsy types. Charlotte has access to a small mountain, but if being outdoors is a way of life for you, you really need to be in the Blue Ridge Mountains. Ashville also has the reputation of being an artists' community.

Concord and Kannapolis are most notable for access to Charlotte, but aren't terribly exciting places to live.

"Oh I agree also but just I feel like when it comes to a lot of issues, I just don‚Äôt think govt is doing a good job of trying to resolve them, no matter if it‚Äôs on the left or right (even if they have full control of govt) and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm an unaffiliated voter. Same with judges also. And I do agree the justice system does need fixed in certain areas though like simple marijuana possession. 

But as far as issues where govt isn‚Äôt doing a lot to fix them, there‚Äôs a lot of them. For example, with gun violence. You wanna know how to fix gun violence. 

#1, Anyone caught with a stolen firearm (doesn‚Äôt matter the age), any felon caught with a firearm, any drug dealer or gang member caught with a gun, anyone underage caught with a gun (under 18 for long guns and under 21 for handguns), anyone caught trafficking guns and selling to people on the streets who can‚Äôt pass a background check, needs to stay in jail with no bond. There have been several instances in Mecklenburg County where our judiciary would let criminals out that would be caught with a stolen firearm and they‚Äôd get out on bond, and then reoffend like one of the killers involved in the mountain island drive by shooting that took the life of a child last Summer. 

But point being is if people are gonna advocate for more gun laws, why can‚Äôt current gun laws be enforced fully? We already have laws that says felons can‚Äôt own gun. There‚Äôs also laws that prohibit stealing firearms and if someone is caught with one, it‚Äôs a felony with a 2 year prison sentence in North Carolina. And we all know why certain people steal guns, because they can‚Äôt pass background checks. And we already have a background check system for guns sold by federally licensed gun dealers, but it‚Äôs up to every state to make sure criminal and mental health records are in the system. 

And when it comes to all the guns caught in CMS this school year and some of them being stolen, why aren‚Äôt parents monitoring where their children are and just letting them roam free anytime of day or night on the streets and letting them hangout with whoever? 

But to wrap #1, if gun control works, why aren‚Äôt places like NY, NJ, Illinois (specifically Chicago), and California the safest places in the country? 

And to add also, same if anyone shoots into an occupied residential house, people like that need to stay in jail and denied bond. 

#2, Our schools no matter where they‚Äôre in this country need to be as safe as other things in our society like banks, jewelry stores, govt buildings, high end luxury stores, and political elites on both sides of the aisle. I mean look at the Mecklenburg County courthouse, that‚Äôs one of the most secured buildings in uptown CLT and when you enter you have to go through security and there have been several times they‚Äôve (Meck Sheriff) caught people with guns at the entrances. Even if someone is a legal concealed permit holder, it‚Äôs already prohibited in a lot of states from carrying in any federal, state, or local govt building as well inside of a school. Why can‚Äôt all of our schools be like this? Considering the amount of firearms that have been caught in CMS this school year that students had on them or in their backpack. 

#3, as someone who‚Äôs a responsible long gun owner like myself, I take pride in being safe and responsible with firearms and I preach it. I grew up in a gun household as a kid and every gun my dad owned, whether if it was a .243 hunting rifle or a shotgun, he always had them locked up in a gun safe and unloaded and always securely stored ammo and firearms separately. And to this day, there‚Äôs never been an accident personally where a firearm accidentally discharges. Same with proper firearm storage, I will never understand why people leave loaded firearms in their locked vehicles because cars are not gun safes nor will they ever be, even if you have it in a locked trunk  or a locked glovebox.",t2_5h74kppt,NCguy1995,0,1648939524.0,0,t1_i35sq64,i35sq64,False,pencilno22,t3_tug4ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/tug4ko/charlotte_elections_whats_the_scoop/,Charlotte Elections - What's the scoop?,/r/Charlotte/comments/tug4ko/charlotte_elections_whats_the_scoop/i35sq64/,1,r/Charlotte,0,1

"You also have to consider that getting an implant can be a 3-6 month long process, depending on if the patient needs bone grafting. Many cheap dental offices will extract a tooth and place an implant on the same day, leaving no time for grafting, healing, and integration of the implant into the bone. If done correctly, implants require multiple trips to the oral surgeon/dentist. Also, if there is a problem with an implant placed in Mexico, most local dentists won‚Äôt touch it, because they don‚Äôt want to be responsible for another person‚Äôs shoddy dental work.

"A quick add to the convo. My options are limited where I‚Äôm at. Had the fastest ATT they offered at 20/5 which I had for a couple years and cost ~$50/m. Service was fine and support reasonable but the speed was very problematic. My only other option was spectrum and went with 400/20, free install and started at $65/m. Full gig was $110/m but was $400 to install. Six months after my promotional price ended my 400/20 service costs $100/m, it goes up $5-15 every 2-3 months and spending hours on the phone to get it lowered entirely negates the savings. We‚Äôve had several outages over that time and is usually back up within a few hours, a few times it‚Äôs taken >24h.  Speed has always been consistently 480/25 which includes overhead so no complaints there. The worst has been customer support, over the phone and in person. Their install and service techs have all been fantastic though. I‚Äôve been on google fibers list for over three years and they finally finished laying fiber down in my area and my install date is next week. Twice the down speed, 50 times the up speed, $70/m, free install and so far great techs and no worries about rates being hiked up with zero notice until the bill is due. Can‚Äôt wait to shed spectrum. The poor customer service and silent rate increases are the most problematic for many reasons.

Glad you guys got that done. Our neighborhood is small and already there are enough rentals and neighbors who lean against amendments. Several lawyers who live here have said they think it would be costly to draw up and hard to defend in court.

So you're just saying all new housing should be subsidized? Well that's not really private developer's problem. And currently society isn't willing to put up the cost (aka even if the city council or Congress wanted to do this there isn't enough current funds so taxes would need to go up).

But vacancy rates are low, so people are leasing them. Almost 100 people move to the city a day. The housing supply hasn't been keeping up with that, and unless new housing is added it will continue to get much much worse (so therefore even these luxury apartments are helping).

">Right... but there *is* enough luxury housing.

Is there? What is your reasoning for saying this? Are all these new ""luxury"" apartments empty/unleased? Or is that just a feeling based on the fact that most new builds are labeled luxury?

Like the other guy was saying, you can either build new ""luxury"" housing or subsidized housing (more or less). With the cost of construction, it basically doesn't make sense to build anything other than luxury units especially in an area like uptown/southend where the land itself is super expensive, unless it's being subsidized. Even the most bleeding-hearted developer isn't going to build unless it makes economic sense.

I've read/listened to a little on this, but I'm not an expert. What would you propose?

"How the fuck do you think you get more affordable housing? Honestly? There are two options: build more or subsidize. Housing is already heavily subsidized. We should be focused on building more which means working on zoning laws. 

You‚Äôre mad because I understand economics apparently. Affordable housing is an issue in every major city and suburban areas. Why is that? Because that‚Äôs where the high paying jobs are so skilled workers move there and their incomes can afford higher prices, so without enough supply prices rise because an increasing demand from people with deeper pockets bidding against one another pushes up prices to a new equilibrium. It‚Äôs really not that complex. It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of supply it is.

"I have used thumbtack and task rabbit to find individual cleaners to do individual cleaning services. 

The person on taskrabbit does not have an active profile at the moment but did a great job. They did my dishes for me when my dishwasher broke. 

The folks on thumbtack also did a great job but did laundry services for me so I can't speak to non-laundry services. (Iron/steam about 3 loads of dress clothes). 

I think that depending on the size of the home and the level of what you consider to be deep cleaning this is going to be either a 2-4 person job to be in one day or a multiple day job for an entire home if you want it to be ""to the max""

I think that a lot of folks expect to underpay for cleaning services.

"Having more housing supply helps keep costs down (or at least not rise as fast) when demand is high. Demand is high right now, thus an increase in supply helps.

If there isn't enough ""luxury"" housing for the banker bros and yuppies to rent then they'll have to go somewhere else which means they'll be renting the more affordable options. If they rent/buy those more affordable options where does everyone else go? And any landlord or apartment is going to go with the people with higher pay and better credit first. Not building housing drives up costs for everyone even if what is being built is ""luxury"". There's a concept called NOAH (Naturally Occurring Affordable Housing), which basically means older units become more affordable (in comparison to other units on the market when inflation is taken into account).

"I found someone on Care.com after striking out with a local company. They too, were supposed to do a deep clean. I pre-cleaned EVERYTHING, so they could focus on the deep cleaning. The girls were very young. I knew how to clean at their age, so I dismissed my initial thought that they might not do a great job. They finished early, because I guess my house already looked clean. They didn't clean baseboards, walls, doors, or do any of the deep cleaning items promised. When you say you're going to CLEAN baseboards, I expect water and detergent to be applied, not a duster haphazardly swiped in the general direction of the baseboards. Windows, they are aplenty and they were not gotten clean. They spent time cleaning the screen porch, because they ran out of things to do in their time allotted...but they didn't do what was promised. Look on Care.com.

"That would usually require a high percentage of owners to vote to change the HOA, and some owners will consider it their right to decide what to do with their property so they will vote against it. The property owners who already rent houses out or who think they may want to in the future won‚Äôt support it. Also it can be costly to defend if someone challenges the HOA in court - which will cost all of the HOA members legal fees.

"> Preventing single-family rental home companies ‚Äî of any size ‚Äî from purchasing homes in a community does nothing but reduce the availability of affordably priced rental housing.

It‚Äôs funny, because that‚Äôs the point? Push out the rental homes in exchange for more owner occupied. 

> these companies have been expanding their portfolios of tens of thousands of single-family houses, a disproportionate number of them located in majority-Black neighborhoods like Potters Glen.

It‚Äôs odd to me that they are trying to paint it as a racist issue, but aren‚Äôt minorities more likely to be renters? And minorities are more likely to want to live in an already minority area (not saying they are avoiding majority areas but if white people are avoiding minority areas then minorities would be disproportionately interested in living there.) 

Anyway, it makes sense to buy homes to rent out in the areas where you expect there to be the most demand for rentals. 

> Using the same legal authority that allows homeowners associations

HoA‚Äôs‚Ä¶ ya hate them until you need them. Then you eventually hate them again probably. 

> The rise of investor purchases has spawned complaints that the companies, ‚Ä¶ and renting to tenants who have not been properly screened.

I also find this funny because I‚Äôm pretty sure the investors also want to rent to tenants that are properly screened. Looks like both the HoA and investors can agree that the tenants need to go in this situation. 

Anyway, I don‚Äôt really have skin in the game.

We used Blue Raven and I can't recommend them.  They were fast and gave us great information.  Our sales guy was awesome.  They got everything approved through our HOA.  The problem we had was multiple leaks.  They came out and fixed them quickly for us to then discover more leaks that had to be fixed and they still haven't been back out to fix our ceiling.  We have water damage in multiple spots and nobody will contact us back.  I'm glad our leaks are fixed.  I'm glad our panels work very well and completely cover our electric bill.  But the water damage on our ceiling in a house less than a year old really pisses me off.

"Were you actually in the area as an adult because I bought in the metro area during that time. 

It took me 18 months to close (we started literally right before the crash). 

We had multiple local banks and credit unions fail on us during the process. And we ended up buying the home for less than 50% of what we were originally going to pay for it. Part of that is because the house needed more work than we thought it did, so it's not like we just screwed the person over or anything, but the way that we found out it needed more work is because the guidelines got stricter. Also the value just dropped.

You know as Banks were failing they changed their policies on who got loans and who didn't. 

We ended up in a much higher interest rate than we would have. 

If we had not already been renting the home the bankruptcy facilitator probably would have got sick of even trying to sell it because of the inability to get a mortgage. Not because of the quality of the home but because of the market. 

I know we're in a different situation now but Banks can and will start tightening what they're doing. I'm in the middle of refinancing now, this is my second refinance with the same company and the FHA lender is being much stricter. 

They're requiring things to be changed that did not have to be done on the original sale or on the last refinance which was just like 18 months ago. 

Such as extending my gutters. 

There are little tiny things that they're making sure done before they let me refinance especially at the Lock and rate that I have that is lower than what is right now. 

They're also nitpicking every single document that I've sent them and that did not happen before. 
Not because anything's wrong but they want to make sure that I fit every single qualification that they have. 

When I refinanced 18 months ago it was bing bam boom done.  

And I've been with this lender for over 10 years with never even a payment in that ""Grace period"" you have. Always auto paid on time. 

So banks are already being more scrutinizing towards what's coming in for loans and interest rates are higher. 

I'm not saying it's 2008 but as a home buyer who bought during the Great Recession in the metro area Charlotte did not ""shrug it off""",t2_ejfhga4d,morbidbutwhoisnt,0,1648851060.0,0,t1_i31fc26,i31fc26,False,morbidbutwhoisnt,t3_tsrr2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlotte/comments/tsrr2s/are_we_on_the_verge_of_a_housingbubble_bust_an/,Are we on the verge of a housing-bubble bust?
