">seeing museums is basically all I want to do

While I get that because I'm very big on visiting museums myself, and there are so many great museums in Florence, I hope you take some time to enjoy the other things the city has to offer. ;)

You can buy a 5-day Passepartout ticket for 38 euros and it includes the Uffizi Gallery, Pitti Palace, Boboli Gardens, the National Archeaological Museum and the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, all of which I recommend. Using the following website, click on the Uffizi Gallery and look for that option. Be sure to put in a date or the website won't proceed.

https://webshop.b-ticket.com/webshop/webticket/eventlist

As for the other museums, you can also purchase tickets on that website but keep your eye on the Firenze Card option. Depending on when you come, it might be put back into circulation since Italy has started to lift covid restrictions and if all goes well, they'll lift even more. The Firenze Card website also lists all the free museums, as well as other useful information.

"May weather can be tricky. Very warm one day, cool and rainy the next, so layering is the key. A sweater that will go with every outfit and a light rain jacket and umbrella is advisable.

As far as whether dresses will be practical, it depends on the style. If you bring something tight-fitting and short, probably not. If you go with something looser and longer (which is my recommendation), it shouldn't be a problem. Be sure you have tops that cover your shoulders if you plan to visit churches.

Keep shoes sensible. I know finding cute sensible shoes isn't always easy, but take the time to find the right combination. Flexible, supportive and well-fitting is the only way to go. I'd leave any rigid platforms at home. Lots of uneven pavement to navigate. A pair of cute sandals that will go with everything and a pair of converse should be enough. And if you're buying new, break them in before you come.

Edit: It's way too easy to over pack trying to think of every possible need just to realize that you didn't wear half of what you brought. I always recommend packing light because if you find you didn't pack something you absolutely need, you can always buy it here. Tons of shops.

"Pisa is very doable as a day trip, maybe even a half day. Cinque Terre is more involved, as there are five towns to see.

Be prepared with good walking shoes and a water bottle- it is VERY hilly.

If you have any interest in seeing Cinque Terre, you could do what we did last summer and take an early train from Florence to Pisa, walk around for a couple hours (before all the tourists arrive!), and then continue on to La Spezia. Then book a return trip from La Spezia back to Florence.

"Oltrarno (best option IMO): Loggia roof Bar is my favourite in Santo Spirito. It's an hotel's bar on a lovely terrace that overlooks the piazza. Any other bar in Piazza Santo Spirito is quite nice, if you can stay outside. Pitta M'Ingolli is my favourite, though. Obviously the roof bar is a tad bit more expensive (10€ a cocktail, if I remember correctly), but it's nothing out of this world.

Caffè degli artigiani or Bulli & Balene are two good spots between Piazza Santo Spirito and Palazzo Pitti. 

La Citè is probably the prettiest spot in Borgo san Frediano, but there are loads of bars in that street, so you can choose whichever you like the most if you're around there. 

If you're willing to walk a bit more, Via di San Niccolò has loads of bars and the're pretty nice. 

City Centre: La Menagere, near the San Lorenzo church, is kinda chic, but could do the job.

"What are you are looking for is ""zuppa inglese"". The one I see in the picture is a variation. I guess is something like meringue crusted zuppa inglese. 

At this link: https://ricette.donnamoderna.com/zuppa-inglese-rapida-alla-crema-in-crosta-di-meringa

you can find the recipe.

Zuppa cotta is the name the Caffe Gilli (a big provider of desserts for a lot of Florence's restaurant) gives to this dish because ""Meringue crusted zuppa inglese"" is a long and awful name.

"You're welcome. If you book in advance the high speed train you may be able to save 10 to 20€, which is not bad. High speed trains usually costs between 40 and 60€ depending on when you buy it. 

Short guide at trains in Italy.

Possible train numbers beginning: 
REG= Regional.
RV= Regionale Veloce = Fast Regional.
IC= InterCity.
FR= FrecciaRossa (Red Arrow) = High Speed.
FA= FrecciaArgento (Silver Arrow) = High Speed.
FB= FrecciaBianca (White Arrow) = Kind of high speed InterCity.

Trains with 4 digits make a few stops, trains with 5 digits make more stops. 
High speed trains are 4 digits and start with 8 or 9. 

Those of Italo Treno company follow the same principles, but they only have high speed trains. 
Fun fact #1: Italy is one of the few countries in Europe to have more than one train company.
Fun fact #2: There is a high speed train running between Milan and Paris, just in case you need it, and it is operated either by the French company or by the Italian company.

"As far as I remember Fiumicino train station is a minor station: it stops there the Leonardo Express train which only runs Fiumicino to Roma-Termini, and some regional trains with various destinations but still in the vicinity of Rome. 
Some of them stop in the other main station of Rome (Roma-Tiburtina) but they make many stops in between. You have to choose between saving some money and taking more time, or taking less time but spending more money. 

Your best option is to get from FCO airport to either Tiburtina or Termini and then taking the AV (Alta Velocità = High Speed) train to Florence.

"There's a train from Fiumicino airport to Rome train station (Stazione Roma-Termini), it's like 14€ if I remember. Avoid taxies/cabs as much as you can, they're hella expensive.
From there you can take the train to Florence (stazione Firenze S.M.N.): you can choose between the normal regional train which is like 4 hours, or the high speed train, which is 1h30m. Of course there's a price difference. 

Go to www.trenitalia.com which is the state-owned train company which has all the trains, or to www.italotreno.it which is a private company operating only high-speed trains. 
It's your choice, have a look at prices on both. 
For your reference: AV means high-speed (Alta Velocità), and AV trains usually have their number starting with 9 or 8.

You land on Fiumicino and took a train to Florence, Frecciarossa or Italo if I can suggest more expensive but they are both high speed train and in a couple of hours you can be in Florence.

A metal tub without a lid is also OK but make sure the colors are natural (indicating that there are no additives/food coloring).  For example, banana gelato should be a sort of grayish-beige (like an actual ripe banana) instead of yellow.

If the tub has no lid you do NOT want the gelato to be piled high.

"I can say the Uffizi is definitely worth it! Italy used to use a letter system to classify their museums. And the Uffizi is an A-Class museum. There are so many well known and (art)historically important piece there. 

However. It is important to know beforehand that (at least during non pandemic times) there was quite a queue. It might really be worth looking into if you can buy tickets beforehand online.

As for what else to see. Honestly, I would just wander around a bit. The city centre isn't all that big. At least go and look at the Palazzo Pitti (which is Santo Spirito area - which a good place to get an aperitivo) and Pallazo Strozzi. They are both very interesting buildings (not to mention that the museums in Palazzo Pitti are also really good - I worked in the Galleria Palatina for half a year).

As for gelato I really liked [this](https://www.tripadvisor.de/Restaurant_Review-g187895-d1861207-Reviews-Gelateria_della_Passera-Florence_Tuscany.html) place.

"First of all, thanks for the gold!

Lampredotto is like tripe, but it tastes better in my opinion. The consistency is what puts most people off: it's a bit mushy and slightly slimy. If you like the consistency of oysters (lampredotto is less mushy and way less slimy, though), for example, you should be good in this department. 

The best thing you can do is to go before lunch and ask if you can sample a little piece. Lampredotto is a pretty divisive food, people either love it or hate it, but it's definitely worth trying, especially because you can basically eat it only here.

For example, a friend of mine from Bologna and her sister came to Florence a couple of years ago.

"Il magazzino, which is in a little square near Palazzo Pitti, is my favourite if you want to try typical florentine food with some twists (the ravioli al lampredotto and the beef cheek are amazing imo). 

There's a great new place near Porta al prato called Casa Ciabattini, with pasta dishes as their main specialty.

Tripperia Pollini is a good spot for a quick and cheap lunch on the street if you are in the Sant'Ambrogio area. You can also pay a visit to the San Lorenzo Market for lunch: upstairs there are many solutions in a more refined environment, while downstairs there are Nerbone and Bambi that make local delicacies (lampredotto, trippa, pappa al pomodoro, ribollita and so on).

If you have a car (or are willing to take a cab), you can go to Coquinarius in their Fiesole location to have a great dinner with a view. Another restaurant with similar features is Lo strettoio, which is open for dinner only on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Coquinarius is more easily reachable, though.

"Since you've already gotten a tip in regards to the museums (which I can still talk about for hours on end - I studied museology and did an internship in Florence in the Galleria Palatina - so I know the museums \^\^) I'll mention something else. 

The Duomo is free. You'll probably pass over it anyways, but the Ponte Vecchio is of course free. There is also Piazza della Signoria which has a lot of beautiful art (a copy of David, the Neptune fountain by Ammannati, the rape of the sabines by Giambologna - a personal favorite of mine - and Perseus with the head of Medusa by Cellini). San Lorenzo Market. 

I am sure there is a lot more, but it's been a few years. 

Ok. I'll still say something regarding the museums. The Bargello might not be as well known, but I really liked it. The Uffizi usually has a horrendously long queue, but in all honesty, it really is worth is. And it is worth paying for (the queue on the free entry day is just absolutely insane).

"This is probably not exactly what you are looking for, but I thought I'd mention it nonetheless. 

I spent half a year back in 2014 in Florence doing my internship at the Galleria Palatina. I had a flat share just around the corner from there (yeah, I was lucky as hell!) in Via Mazzetta. Just across from the house was this little shop that sold bottles of wine. You could also have them re-fill the bottles, so you didn't have to always buy new ones. 

They had a great/huge selection of wine. The lady who worked there was incredibly nice (by coincidence she either was German or at least just spoke German - which was funny as I am German). She let me try a lot of different wines until I found one I really liked.

"Update:
This post worked like a charm.

My buddy and I ended up meeting up with a couple from CA.  We watched the 49er’s game at The Lions Fountain pub and ran into another guy from Kansas City who was in town for his sisters new baby.
We had too many beers, and a ton of laughs.

We met up again today for wine on a roof top overlooking Il Duomo before getting pizza nearby.

This was the first Reddit meet up for all of us and we would highly recommend it. Excellent vibe and we all had really good time! Put yourself out there and don’t be scared of strangers, they might turn into some friends!

Your country isn’t connected to the EU Digital Covid Certificate system. You need to show your country’s official vaccination certificate (such as the CDC white card for US travelers) or an official recovery certificate issued by government or state health authorities, as the equivalent in Italy to the super green pass.   
  
Be advised that not all restaurant and venue owners in Italy uniformly recognize vaccination certificates that cannot be scanned by the Italian system; however, this FAQ on the Italian government on its green pass website (in Italian only) states that US and Canadian vaccination and recovery certificates are valid as super green pass equivalents in Italy.

hopefully this contains all the info you need?

"Hi there , I thought I could give my  view on this topic:

Background - I'm a 27 y/o dark skin black girl that's marrying a Florentine man.  I've only been to Florence twice so far (summer of 21 -  for 2 months and in November).  But, we are headed back in March and we are moving there full time. So I have a bit of  recent insight. 

Coming from living in US ( originally from Germany) Florence/Italy has a lot less racial problems than the continental US, but like anywhere there are still problems. I found out that many racial problems and experience varies from each region.

For example, in Elba and there were no serious racial problems, but there were the looks, the "" you have the perfect tan ""  and ""can you swim?""  comments  and being the only black person in many places( which can happen a lot- went to the Uffizi and 4 hours later I was still the only one- you will get use to it)  

Venice, Verona, Pisa- besides the looks, I can't remember anything racial that happened there.

Rome, Milan and Florence  seem to be more classism than racism per se; I only had one truly racial issue in Florence but that was at a nightclub so I kind of ready for the worst, so when it happened I wasn't too surprise. But unlikely the US it was done very subtly.  

Florence - like I stated it's classism mixed with racism, but if you ""play the game/code switch "" you will be fine. Fair warning the immigrant population in Florence will use you being black women as a guilt trip and it will happen a lot. You will see many immigrants (I can't say if they are African or not and would hate to make a generalisation, but you get what I'm trying to say). They will come up to you and say "" Sister,  Auntie, etc. we have to help each other  and we are the same colour, look at a photo of my child "" and try to get you to buy something or wanting money. It's a hustle. Ignore them, don't put your purse behind you, don't touch any they give you, keep walking . If you speak other language or know a few words (Not French,  most are fluent) , just start speaking it or making up words and keep walking, they will get the hint.

 ""Play the Game/Code Switch"" - anything you do in your American Uni or Corporate America , do it in Italy( again each region and town can be very different ; e.g. Cortona is very different from Rufina but it's still Tuscany.)   'Dressing nice is a must,  Proper English ( most Italians I've met, actually enjoy learning ""American slang"", so if you say ""ain't""  with friends it leads to a very interesting discussion, because each region actually has their own ""slang"" terms). All in all just be well put together and  this will clearly give the signal that you from a certain class, and people will treat you better. 

Even though, there are some racial issues that do annoy me, I would still chose Italy as a whole over most States.  At my fiancé suggestion, to get to know Florence, I walked from Michelangelo Square to the Duomo to my Hotel ( which is about 35 to 40 minute walk) alone at night and felt completely safe. I even asked police officers and a few others for directions (in English) and never felt unsafe  or felt threaten, I would never do this is the US.

Like you said , one bad experience shouldn't stop you from experiencing the world... I had one bad experience in Florence and I'm still happily moving there :)

I hope you have a great study aboard programme !!!",t2_60vc4jud,Don_Gia,0,1641155924.0,0,t1_hqzahzs,hqzahzs,True,mindlessrica,t3_rl2z77,https://www.reddit.com/r/florence/comments/rl2z77/racial_climate_in_italy/,Racial climate in Italy?,/r/florence/comments/rl2z77/racial_climate_in_italy/hqzahzs/,2,r/florence,0,2

"Hi. International certifications are recognized. Just bring your card with you all the time and you're gonna be fine.

Similar to other countries, Italy has also opened its borders for travellers all over the world who hold a COVID-19 Green Certificate.

Italy currently has its own COVID-19 Green Certificate, which is an extension of the EU Digital COVID-19 Certificate. Such a document is used to prove whether the holder has been fully vaccinated, has recovered from the COVID-19 disease or has recently taken a negative test result.

A vaccination certificate has proven to be the most common and convenient form since it remains valid for up to one year. However, not all countries recognise the same vaccines as valid proof of immunity.

“The certification of successful completion of the vaccination cycle must relate to one of the four vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency,” the Ministry stated.

Based on the Ministry’s statement, it means that only the following vaccines listed below are recognised as valid proof of vaccination in Italy:

Comirnaty Pfizer-BioNTech by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH
Spikevax, formerly Moderna by Moderna Biotech Spain, SL
Vaxzvria, formerly AstraZeneca by AstraZeneca Ab
Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) by Janssen – Cilag International NV

In addition, the Italian authorities have announced that for a vaccination certificate to be valid, the document must be provided in Italian, English, French, or Spanish.

Regarding the validity of the vaccination certificate, it has also been emphasised that the document will start being valid until 14 days have passed since the completion of the vaccination process.

"Let's start with the suggestions:

1) no walk ins for supper on NYE. You need to book in advance. Prices are usually higher and it will probably be a 4-5 course meal including some seasonal favourites like zampone + lenticchie or some traditional holiday cake like panettone and/or pandoro.

2) most people will be wanting to have a good view of the fireworks on the river at midnight. some will be walking on the streets, many will be having dinner at home with friends and then crowd the streets.

3) the city will be crowded, but that depends a lot on travel restrictions for the covid 19 pandemic. I guess half crowded compared to 3-4 years ago, probably, maybe more.

4) everything will be open, except on the 25th and 26th of December and on the 1st of January (national holidays).

Rain here is usually proper rain, not a tropical storm but a substantial amount of water.As a comparison it is very rare to have hours of light rain or drizzle like part of the UK weather (Using UK because I'm familiar with it ... no offence)

Thunderstorm are common but not so frequent and the next week's weather doesn't look like it for the moment.

it is hard to say what the usual rainy day looks like but i would say that on average there're few hours of heavy rain more than a constant rain all day long.

"Piazza Pitti and its palace is one of the main attractions in Florence so it's very common to see a lot of people coming and going or enjoying a rest on its ""sdrucciolo"" (the big square in front of it)..  


The square is pretty big compared to the florentine standards so you rarely have the feeling of a real crowd packed but due to traffic and small side walk along the building it could be tricky sometimes to cross the square.  


In any case pitti area is a very lovely place to stay and usually it is very quiet in the morning until 10 when most shops opens.  
If you are visiting it now despite october being a high season month, due to the current situation florence is not too crowded in general and you will enjoy a nice stay, I'm sure of it.  


Let us know!

Oltrarno (meaning the triangle between pontevecchio/ponte vespucci and porta romana) is a  bigger area and while there're some nice areas in generalit  is way more crowded and houses one next to each other and narrower streets. With the car you most probably need a garage.

"N26 Is what you are looking for :)
Debit card, mastercard circuit. Free of charge. All managed via app.
Can provide you an invite, I think it gives you a (some) € bonus ?

Otherwise, just open a bank account on Banca Intesa. They'll deliver the card and the management app is fully in English",t2_ek423,piffopi,0,1634072662.0,0,t1_hgehwyv,hgehwyv,True,chloe_crc,t3_q6hby3,https://www.reddit.com/r/florence/comments/q6hby3/international_student_bank_recommendations/,International student bank recommendations?,/r/florence/comments/q6hby3/international_student_bank_recommendations/hgehwyv/,2,r/florence,0,2

"Try Postepay Evolution, it's a prepaid card system managed by one of the biggest organizations in Italy, Poste Italiane. Be aware that big doesn't necessarily mean that it works, it means that there is a Poste office pretty much everywhere, so if you need infos or a refill, you don't need to travel by car or else. I don't really know if it can suit you, but it's worth a try.
