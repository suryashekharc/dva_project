I can't honestly speak to how the schools are in that area, because my child is an adult but I've never heard anything bad, other than this school board having some quite controversial old school members.

"Is there a double standard though? My husband is a 6’4 white guy and he probably stood out like a sore thumb in Richmond (predominately Asian) when he first moved there years and years ago. Of course he would have felt more comfortable with a few more white people around. He’d probably blend in a bit more. That’s just normal. He wouldn’t be marked a nazi for voicing that. The average person would see it as understandable. It was new to him at the time just like it’s new to people who move out here from Vancouver. We’re used to seeing a bit more diversity. It doesn’t mean we don’t like white people just like it didn’t mean my husband didn’t like Asians. People move out here for all sorts of reasons: to take care of aging or ailing parents, to buy a larger place that would cost an arm and a leg in Vancouver or to work. Why is OP so bad for just voicing wanting to see more Asians around? If you want to talk about racist, my knee jerk reaction to moving out here was to assume most people were uneducated, looked like they’d love Trump, hate science and think vaccines are of the devil. That is racist as fuck. But at least I can admit it. It stems from my own ignorance about people from smaller towns. Maybe your knee jerk reaction is to assume OP is an asshole for wanting to see more diversity or that he/she doesn’t like white people and wants to eradicate white communities because he or she wants to see more asians around. Maybe even that we all like to stir fry our dogs with soy sauce on Sundays. It isn’t racist for OP to voice wanting to see a few more Asians around just as it isn’t racist for you to feel more comfortable with more white people around. Maybe that’s what you’re used to so that’s what’s comfortable for you.

"Chilliwack has its drug problems like every other place and it's more urban than you would think.  The north side of the highway, especially in the downtown Chilliwack area, tend to have a fairly high crime rate and the associated problems with drug use. There are some harm reduction sites in Chilliwack, so hopefully that means that there aren't too many needles and stuff in the parks in that area.

The south side of the highway tends to be a more suburban feel, and there are places like Ryder, Lake, Chilliwack, River Valley, and cultus Lake, yarrow that have a small town /rural feel, or areas like Greendale or Rosedale that are mostly farm communities.  If You're open to expanding outwards a bit Agassiz and popkum are quieter and probably a bit cheaper for housing.  

There is a fairly high contingent of very traditional and right-wing religious folk in this area, but due to the influx of new blood that is changing rapidly.

"I'm not sure you can compare a major world religion to a fairly small scale cult. (Though many atheists undoubtedly would argue that religion is a form of cult anyways.)

However no, I have no issue with Muslim or Catholic faith members or most religious folks in general except for the specific ones who take it too far and use actions to inflict harm on others - as in any group. But those two example groups' scriptures don't force them to regularly abuse their children. (That happens from regular old power in many cases.) But if I discovered that my going to the Vatican for instance directly funds the Pope to molest young choir boys, I wouldn't go there either. And especially if the Bible was written to encourage that very specific behaviour and was widely followed by the majority of the Catholic faith. 

>If some people in their cult are abusive that doesn’t make them all abusers.

It does when the faith system hinges on this very concept to its core. ""Child-rearing is heavily regulated by a book at the center of the group called the “Authority Teachings.”... The teachings instruct parents to physically discipline their children to instill obedience and help achieve the tribes’ ultimate goal: 144,000 male virgins. The group says it needs to produce that number of male virgins to bring the second coming of Jesus Christ and the apocalypse, as cited in the book of revelations.""
... 
“Injury is to impair soundness of health; to wound. But stripes or marks from loving discipline shows love by the parent.”

>What difference does it make what they believe in? 

Beliefs are important in a society. I might decide I believe all men should be castrated from birth, and while you would disagree, certainly you would also judge and likely hate me for it. But actions are what really matter. It's one thing to believe in forced male castration, and it's another to action it. This particular group's belief (and actions) is that you must not spare the rod through the excuse of the most literal interpretation of the Bible. I have no doubt they may be friendly people on the public-facing surface because why should they risk exposing themselves? It certainly wouldn't be a sound business model if they wish to continue to fund their compound and their way of life. But it is literally part to their religious documentation that children should be frequently punished with physical abuse in order to further their ultimate religious purpose including to the point of leaving visible marks on their bodies. It isn't just a consequence of some members in their community; it is the purpose of the entire community. 

>The fact that you’d rather judge a whole group of people because some people in their group in another country are assholes shows you have too little empathy. 

This isn't a one off case. Nor is it foreign. This is undoubtedly in all of their chapters around the world including in Chilliwack as it is baked into the belief system. Who I have empathy and sympathy for is the children. Idgaf about the adults who willfully participate in a group which encourages child abuse. Sure, most may have been raised into this and know no other way and, I can have some small sympathy for that as well I suppose, but it doesn't mean I need to encourage and financially support the actions. 

>The people that work there are just normal people who want to live their life a certain way

You could say anyone is a ""normal"" person trying to live their life a certain way. Would you say the same though about pedophiles or serial killers if they had a day job which benefited you as a customer? Who do you consider an abnormal person wanting to ""live their life a certain way""? 

>yet you project that you’re the moral one. 

I don't purport to be anything. Least of all to being morally perfect. But to quote yourself, ""what difference does it make what [I] believe in?""  You seem perfectly happy to judge me and my beliefs, but not those of these other strangers. ""Ironic.""

"I don’t care what people’s personal life and beliefs are, I am open minded. You however are clearly not. The people that work there are just normal people who want to live their life a certain way, away from our modern technological way of life. If some people in their cult are abusive that doesn’t make them all abusers. Enough with the black and white thinking. Would you not eat at a restaurant owned by muslims? Or Catholics? What difference does it make what they believe in? The food is fantastic and they are nice people. That’s literally all I’m looking for in a restaurant. The fact that you’d rather judge a whole group of people because some people in their group in another country are assholes shows you have too little empathy yet you project that you’re the moral one.

"confederate flags were from truckers who came up from south of the border(primarily)  I believe vaccination rates amongst the american truckers are like 40% unvaxxed, where as canadian truckers were less than 10%.  There was a lone Nazi flag waver who in a separate video was told to fuck off and get lost by a large portion of the protesters.  To think the protesters unanimously support white supremist is kind of silly,  just like to think not one of them was a white supremist.  I would argue the convoy support wasnt solely on the trucker mandate but frustrated canadians tired of a government trying to mandate its way out of a pandemic.  The moment it was revealed vaccinated people could get covid at near the same rate as the unvaccinated, was the time the Federal govt should have removed its support for vaccine passports.  The provinces would have followed suit, and it would have eased tensions with the general population.  Instead he invoked the act for a protest that was very disruptive, yet had no major law enforcement complaints i.e. murder, b&e, assault resulting in hospitalization etc.   I believe the government mishandled the situation leading up to it and over reacted.  Its been widely reported other canadians had their bank accounts shut down as well,  there was probably an automated system that initially did this, and they narrowed it down from there.  I dont believe (outside of a few protesters still in custody) any accounts are still frozen.

As canadians I dont think its acceptable the Government can freeze out bank accounts under any law,  or violate our charter of rights and freedoms due to any implemented policy(vaccine passport)",t2_4ty2c6v0,Leather-Ad7972,0,1647046442.0,0,t1_i0baphg,i0baphg,False,rfdavid,t3_sy06bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/chilliwack/comments/sy06bm/local_mp_mark_strahl_posts_dubious_claim_on/,Local MP Mark Strahl posts dubious claim on Twitter that garners him national attention and ridicule.

"What Mark Strahl the “flyer king” avoiding scrutiny and hiding from the media? Say it isn’t so. I’m shocked is that the same Mark Strahl Chilliwack MP who was put into power by his father Chuck Strahl former chilliwack MP? Chuck Strahl who resigned as chair of Canada's spy agency watchdog because of questionable actions as a lobbyist for Enbridge Gateway pipeline and assisted Mark Strahl in being endorsed by Preston Manning, former leader of the Reform Party of Canada, who said ""Mark Strahl -- by virtue of his family background ... is well prepared for service in the House of Commons."". 
Funny stuff.

According to Wikipedia...

Former Chilliwack city councillor Casey Langbroek said most Conservative Party members from the riding were upset and that the nomination process effectively barred 80% of party members from running. Party member Alex Moens said ""High public office should not be like a family business, where it's passed on from father to son.""

Mark Strahl is an indolent slug feeding like a pig at the public trough, he will continue to do so until enough new voters organize and show up to oust the slug at federal elections.
The old guard voters of Chilliwack have somehow gotten drunk on the Strahl family cool-aid for two generations, they are poisoned and forever lost. Strahl endless barrage of flyers tout the party line and reinforce this kind of twisted propaganda.

Oust this slug next election.

"What Mark Strahl the “flyer king” avoiding scrutiny and hiding from the media? Say it isn’t so. I’m shocked is that the same Mark Strahl Chilliwack MP who was put into power by his father Chuck Strahl former chilliwack MP? Chuck Strahl who resigned as chair of Canada's spy agency watchdog because of questionable actions as a lobbyist for Enbridge Gateway pipeline and assisted Mark Strahl in being endorsed by Preston Manning, former leader of the Reform Party of Canada, who said ""Mark Strahl -- by virtue of his family background ... is well prepared for service in the House of Commons."". 
Funny stuff.

According to Wikipedia...

Former Chilliwack city councillor Casey Langbroek said most Conservative Party members from the riding were upset and that the nomination process effectively barred 80% of party members from running. Party member Alex Moens said ""High public office should not be like a family business, where it's passed on from father to son.""

Mark Strahl is an indolent slug feeding like a pig at the public trough, he will continue to do so until enough new voters organize and show up to oust the slug at federal elections.
The old guard voters of Chilliwack have somehow gotten drunk on the Strahl family cool-aid for two generations, they are poisoned and forever lost. Strahl endless barrage of flyers tout the party line and reinforce this kind of twisted propaganda.

Oust this slug next election.

"Exactly. Flag, not flags. Obviously you naively believe whatever the liberal media spoon feeds you. Here's some facts

There was 1 (one) person who emerged out of no where waving a nazi flag. Everyone at the protest who witnessed this immediately told him to fuck off and shamed him (there's video evidence of this, look it up) this guy waving a nazi flag had his face entirely covered and had several other people with fully covered faces standing very closely too him, as if they were ready to protect him if anyone decided to beat his ass. He's highly suspected to be some sort of plant to discredit the protest, because he didn't stick around for long, he briefly appeared and then people saw him (there's also pictures) disappearing into a hotel that RCMP officers were staying at and he was never seen again. It's almost guaranteed to be a false flag. And regardless, if he wasn't a false flag, and just some genuine piece of shit who saw an opportunity to wave his brand new shiny nazi flag that still had fold creases in it, that doesn't mean he represents the protest nor the protestors. The same way as BLM rioters burning down entire cities and neighbourhoods and murdering cops doesn't represent the core message of systematic racism.

"I don't think homes are sitting too long up there, are they?. The only listening I see currently that's not a new construction was only listed 18 days ago. When I was looking at buying up there the new constructions would say listed forever, even though they had buyers.

It's a really quaint, newer neighbourhood, but it is up on a hill and the drive is a bit obnoxious with some shitty roads and lots of bends. The last stretch of the road to get up there isn't great, so I imagine in the winter it might really suck. Ultimately that's one of the reasons that steered me away from there. 

It's about a 15-20 minute drive from the centre of town and 10-15 from the closest grocery/corner store, but I bet in 5 years it will really expand and the infrastructure will improve.

"Do we also judge them by the people cheering for Pat King when he's on stage? 

But let's be fair; I don't *really* think all of the convoy are racist.

What I *do* think is that a lot of them are willing to ignore *inconvenient* views about prominent figures in the movement - and others are otherwise ignorant of it.

But mostly, I think the convoy is made up of people that are legitimately upset and tired of covid measures but are both misled into thinking that measures themselves are the cause of our problems and not the consequences thereof - and are being taken advantage of by people that have their own political agendas.

Look at the big names in the convoy - organizers, fundraisers... they're largely Wexiteers, Yellow Vest, ""United we roll"", etc twits that have been trying to get a big group of angry people to drive to the capitol for years before covid. They don't give a shit about you or anyone else.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Ok. Can I make an observation? The reason why people are frustrated with anti maskers is because it seems they are reactionary and paranoid. We each choose how we show up in the world. We choose whether to be trusting that people actually intend for the good of others, or we choose (or are conditioned) to believe that people do not want what's best for us and will take advantage of us. One is more trusting, the other more skeptical and negative. To be healthy humans, we need both. Problem is, most anti vaxxers assume most of society is dense and sheep and uncritical- trying to point out the dangers of the world. Whereas most of us have weighed the cost of getting vaccinated vs not. The safety of ourselves vs others ect. We've done what we have for the good of ourselves and others. Not out of fear, out of trust that scientists aren't colluding in some big scheme to control. Anti vaxxers also think they are doing what is best, afraid our country is changing in ways we can't control. To me, this is the real fear. Chaos is the fear. Lack of control is the fear. I'm sorry you don't feel safe in this world, in this country. I know it's frustrating not to feel understood by the majority when you think we are sheep. I know it's frustrating not to do what you want, to be told what to do. But we are doing our best. And it is flawed. But try shifting your narrative to trusting people. Because wherever you go, there you are. At the end of the day you don't actually know anything, as much as you think you do. But you do have a choice which narrative you choose. I choose to trust in our fellow human beings that they have our safety in mind, which, unfortunately trumps the comfort of not wearing a mask or going to a restaurant. Stop reading paranoid narratives and look people in the eyes. They aren't out to get you. We are all in this together. Do you think we secretly like getting needles and wearing masks? Heck no! But we care about one another. And we aren't afraid that our country has lost its way. We care about the greater science community, we care about each other.

I booked two test drives this weekend. I am going to go test drive the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and the Volkswagen ID.4 but I am sort of siding with the Ioniq 5 currently but we will see how they drive. I was looking into the chevy volt but with their financing rates it almost came out to the same payments per week at the ioniq 5 which seems like a far superior car to me.

"I definitely agree to an extent, employers should be at least attempting to keep up with inflation and keeping their employees happy... 

However, everyone needs to understand that this is an incredibly vicious and toxic cycle. It's not your employers responsibility to ""fix"" the effects of inflation, it's your government's. 

If all employers gave all their employers a raise of 7% or more, their cost of doing business increases. Meaning the price of their services or products they offer are also going to increase - driving inflation up (and repeat). I know it's a broad generalization but this is the gist of it. 

What we're seeing today is an extreme case of over-inflation that has a lot to do with covid and the housing market. This cannot be on businesses to keep up. In a normal situation, yes, I would definitely agree employers need to at a minimum match inflation.",t2_c0pb6d2k,bravinci,1,1644590211.0,0,t1_hwibeao,hwibeao,True,WorldlyWerewolf7,t3_spl0ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/chilliwack/comments/spl0ul/hmmmmm/,Hmmmmm…..,/r/chilliwack/comments/spl0ul/hmmmmm/hwibeao/,-2,r/chilliwack,0,-2

"Regret?  Only for not doing it sooner.

&#x200B;

First electric was a Chevy Bolt.  That's the one my daughter now has.  Amazing car.   Really blew me away.

&#x200B;

She took that one over, got a Tesla model Y.   Again, amazing car.

&#x200B;

Abbotsford has a much larger selection of fast chargers than Chilliwack.   There's a decent one at UVF (been there when I thought I could stretch some miles).  The Petro Can station at Whatcom now has some fast chargers.   10 minutes at either of those will take you a long way.  Just remember, the battery charges much faster from 10-50 % than it does from 50-75%.

&#x200B;

If you're even considering NOT getting an electric vehicle, don't test drive one.  There's a reason Tesla spends $0 on a marketing budget.   If you ride in one, you're already 1/2 sold.   I know, you're worried you're missing something.   You are.  That smell on your hands when you put $100 worth of unleaded in your car and it doesn't fuel it up.

&#x200B;

You'll pay for the public fast chargers.  Going from almost empty to 400+ km of range will probably in the $15 range.  Don't kid yourself, it's not free.

&#x200B;

My non-ev friends always tease me about 'range anxiety'.   Yes, I had some.   ""How can you bear to stop for 40 minutes to charge?"" they ask... before they stand outside in the snow or rain for 5 minutes as they put gas in their car... and I watch a quick episode of Seinfeld from the comfort of mine.

&#x200B;

If you're going to Abby daily, run the numbers.  How much do you spend per KM on gas.   Find out what it will cost you with the most expensive EV chargers on gas.  Does it save money with an EV?   For me the numbers were yes, twice.

&#x200B;

So, now I drive a 'pokey' ev, cheap fuel, HOV sticker for getting out to Vancouver.... and even though I gobs of acceleration, I find driving so much less stressful I tend to drive the speed limit anyhow.  Go figure.

&#x200B;

See, no marketing budget.  Those of us with EV's are so happy to talk about it.

"Great questions.

&#x200B;

The 'fast' charger is downtown.  When I bought my first electric, I didn't have any issues getting a charge.  One time I waited maybe 3 or 4 minutes for the person in front of me.

&#x200B;

The Tesla chargers are limited to Teslas at this point. There have been rumors of that changing at some point, but I put no credence in rumors.

&#x200B;

The question I would ask is how far is your daily drive.   If you're often outside of Chilliwack, there are more fast chargers available in Abbotsford.   I found that I changed my mentality of going from full to empty like I did with a gas engine.   Places like the new Save-On Foods have the 'slow chargers' (Level 2) out front.   Unless you are full, plug in for your hour grocery shopping (free charge).   Top off where you can.   There are many areas that do have plugs like that.   Near some of the credit unions, near some restaurants, etc.  There's likely a place you can put a bit of charge in while you're doing something else.   I eventually put a charger in at home, but it's absolutely doable without.

&#x200B;

My daughter lives in a condo, and has an electric car.  Similar situation to what you've described.   With the driving she does, and the availability of the level 2 chargers in her area (shopping malls, etc), she finds she doesn't need to top off at the fast chargers very often.",t2_dzi07,snooker75,0,1644528459.0,0,t1_hwf85iq,hwf85iq,True,leeringapple,t3_sozb9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/chilliwack/comments/sozb9b/public_ev_charging/,Public EV Charging,/r/chilliwack/comments/sozb9b/public_ev_charging/hwf85iq/,3,r/chilliwack,0,3

"I'm not someone who's pro-Trudeau, so I'll just get that out of the way. I'm not a Liberal, or a Conservative, or a supporter of the far left or far right. I think most politicians on any side of the coin don't have people's best interests at heart. People like Pierre Poilievre or Candice Bergen, they don't give a shit about the mandates. 

I think it would have been possible for Trudeau to speak with the convoy organizers had the organizers been more in line with the general sentiment of the actual people protesting. One of the major issues with the protesters is the involvement of people like Pat King, who is an outright white nationalist, BJ Dicther, Tamara Lich. These people are Canadian separatists with affiliations to white nationalism. Dichter has made multiple public anti-immigration statements and anti Muslim statements - he said he was happy to see confederate flags flying in Ottawa (his exact words). Pat King broadcast on his social media something he called ""the depopulation of the Caucasian race"".  Feel free to look this up and have a listen if you want. Are these the people Trudeau is supposed to agree to meet with? They held a press conference last weekend saying they'd be willing to join a coalition government, disregard our democratic process and replace the government. All of them come from the same extremist movements. This type of non sense and racism all but guarantees the prime minister of Canada is never going to meet with them for a rational discussion.

I agree 100% that these people don't represent the views of the majority of protestors. I know that many of these people just want mandates to end and their lives to carry on, I sympathize with that. I agree that the media did a shit job like they usually do, promoting negativity and painting everyone with the same brush. I agree that Trudeau has done a shit job as leader of this country in many respects, including standing at a podium and hardly addressing anything beyond the ""fringe minority"" being a bunch of racists. At the same time though, you have to be aware of where this convoy came from and what that agenda is, because it goes way beyond ending mandates in this country.",t2_1orqmcjt,HiFiMAN3878,0,1644526618.0,0,t1_hwf32i2,hwf32i2,False,CraftPots,t3_snx0m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/chilliwack/comments/snx0m8/what_happened/,What happened??,/r/chilliwack/comments/snx0m8/what_happened/hwf32i2/,2,r/chilliwack,0,2

"> Just feels like it shouldn't matter when majority are vaxxed

Unfortunately, and I mean this entirely earnestly, what it feels like and what it *is* don't align.

Omicron in particular is quite virulent, and while it's ""not that bad"" for most people because of vaccination, unvaccinated people are far more likely to end up clogging up the hospital - and they are. BC saw its highest covid hospitalizations only recently, after all.

Unvaccinated people have been disproportionately loading the public health system, with typical figures being that ~10% of the population is taking up about half the hospital beds in covid wards.


...and while it'd be great if the gov't could wave a magic wand and make the hospitals ""not shit"", best of luck hiring new doctors and nurses en masse after the working conditions they've endured the last few years.

Well, that and we're talking about long-term infrastructure improvements that are needed, not measures we need *now* to keep the healthcare system from becoming nonfunctional under the weight of covid patients.


>I don't like that were pitted against each other.

...and to whose benefit has that been? The government, who have to deal with all these unhappy people? Or the people that have been making political hay since the very beginning of the pandemic by feeding frustration/conspiracy theories.

""It's just a flu"" ""Masks don't work"" ""Okay they do work by why bother it's not that bad"" ""Covid isn't even real"" ""The MSM is conspiring to make covid bad so 'they' can control you!"" 

All while framing themselves as the defenders of ""freedom""

The CPC tried (and failed) to get traction in time for the election.

The convoy was started/organized by Wexiteer/YellowVestCanada/UnitedWeRoll campaigners. These are people that have been trying to get protests to roll to Ottawa since *before* covid. Think they care? Hell no, covid is just a convenient bludgeon for them to hit ""the enemy"" with while getting attention/money. 

I mean, it should have been a clue that the plan from the start was sparked over a cross-border requirement that is *predated* by the requirements on US side of the border.",t2_8q23t,3DBeerGoggles,0,1644258105.0,0,t1_hvz3jx6,hvz3jx6,False,Desperate_Growth2029,t3_sm5nmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/chilliwack/comments/sm5nmy/go_home/,GO HOME,/r/chilliwack/comments/sm5nmy/go_home/hvz3jx6/,1,r/chilliwack,0,1

"Ok cool, we agree on something. That's a start. You do realize that if Dr John spoke directly about the ineffectiveness of covid abatement measures he'd be kicked off YouTube in seconds right? Some reading between the lines may be in order. Regardless, this mess regarding vaccines, mandates, masks, public division and break down of discourse was all but guaranteed to happen exactly like this. Everything is ultimately kind of pointless and absurd at this point. It's more a testament to the efficacy of this specific virus than it is a failure of our mitigation strategies. We were always going to have endemic, continuing recurring covid pandemics once initial containment measures failed. A huge percentage of the population is vaccinated and a huge percentage of people on both sides of this ridiculous absurdity are either currently infected, recovered or will be infected with whatever the strain of the month is. Like I mentioned earlier our best hope is gaining lasting antibodies from infection at this point, but it's likely new strains will negate this, and whether the recovered gain lasting antibodies is yet to be conclusively determined.  It's not going to end with either version of Omicron. It's going to keep mutating and the dominant strains will always be the ones that evade vaccination and are highly contagious. It's literally all bad news from here on out and it will likely only get worse. We don't even know what the long term outlook is for the infected. This beast of a virus has HIV sequences. It literally could be airborne HIV at this point and the only thing keeping us going is addiction to hopium. Very serious long-term health impacts are yet to be determined and regardless of your faith in science the vaccinated are still contracting and spreading this with similar frequency as the unvaccinated. Even the best case scenarios at this point are leading to social and societal collapse. In the absence of truly neutralizing vaccines just imagine what the next waves will bring.

"The honest truth is Darwinism doesn't really apply anymore in the context of survival, its kind of the opposite. More educated people tend to wait later in life and have fewer children while uneducated people have more children at much younger ages.
The convenience of science and modern medicine has created a world in which they can choose to ignore it and still benefit from it all.

Survival in an economic context id say Darwinism still very much applies as its the ones most willing to change and adapt to economic circumstances that come out on top.

"I live in a decapitated black mold infested place because my brother and I are both disabled and don't make enough yet. When we moved in the shower didn't work had to get rid of the washer it was riddled with black mold. The place was disgusting but we had no choice. We have 3 cats so it would be this or homelessness because places don't allow pets. There was blood on the walls here and grime and filth I had to clean off because my brother can't,we had to threaten the landlord with legal action because the one bathroom didn't work and we were paying for two bathrooms.it took 3 months to get him fix it. And thats after he sent rude texts when we said we needed two bathrooms for my physically disabled brother.Not to mention we didn't have a proper locking front door!l that we had to argue for it to be secure. This place is 10000% illegal but we have no choice. We are looking for a new place but with these prices. Not alot of hope. I see alot of homeless disabled wheel chair people around town. What chance do we got. It's rich people coming in and making a profit off us because Canada doesn't have laws against what they are doing. I legit watched the news and they mentioned renting etc was a good way to make quick cash.

"Getting real tired of these anti maskers. Love how they mixed with the hicks and nazis too. It's almost as if all the uneducated people in the world got together and decided it was a good idea to share their dumb conspiracy theories.do they even know what's real anymore? Like for real. What the f.uck is wrong with them. I'm getting to the point that I'm going to start counter protesting because these  I.diots aren't getting it. You CHOSE not to get the vaccine. You CHOSE not to comply wirh scientific facts. That was your choice. Businesses can CHOOSE not to let you in because YOU USED YOUR FREEDOM TO CHOOSE NOT TO WEAR A MASK AND GET A VACCINE.you just didn't like the consequences of your d.umb choice. No short no shoes no service. You know why because it's unhygienic. Now. Replace that with mask and instead of getting sweaty boob money we get covid. Most of use are disabled and working with you typhoid Mary's every single day. My disabled brother is afraid to goto work because of the mask less a holes that could potentially kill him and his family. But you can't just not work.so we are put in a decision less choice. Serve plauge rats and die, or become homeless because we can't make enough to stay above water. I can truly say with no hint of undecisevness,I hate you anti vaxxers.",t2_j1u8p4yg,Desperate_Growth2029,0,1644176973.0,0,t1_hvumgpx,hvumgpx,True,k3lpe,t3_shkhea,https://www.reddit.com/r/chilliwack/comments/shkhea/more_antivax_propaganda_in_garrison/,More anti-Vax propaganda in Garrison,/r/chilliwack/comments/shkhea/more_antivax_propaganda_in_garrison/hvumgpx/,0,r/chilliwack,0,0
