"Why is it that everyone that moves to Utah from another state wants to change it into something it is not? Utah must have had something to offer that you were interested in, but then once you‚Äôre here you bitch and moan about the state and want to change it to fit your personal ideals.

I personally have nothing against recreational use of most drugs, I think adults should be able to chose for themselves what they put into their bodies, including vaccines. That being said, if I wanted to live somewhere that had recreational use legalized I would move to a neighboring state, like Colorado. Or maybe California or Oregon. 

Utah is Utah because of its culture, the legislature does what they can to preserve what is uniquely Utah while also respecting the voice of the voters. It‚Äôs a fine line to walk sometimes. Salt Lake City tends to be very liberal/progressive, while the rest of the state tends to be quite conservative and traditional. I find myself often not fitting in with either group as I am more moderate and middle of the road. I do find it interesting that most people in Salt Lake think the majority of the population side with them, while those outside Salt Lake tend to think the ‚Äòopposition‚Äô is quite limited. 

Needless to say, Utah as a whole is a conservative state and usually votes as such. I could see the medical use of marijuana expanded, and even recreational use decriminalized, but I don‚Äôt think I would hold my breath for it to be outright legalized and available to be sold like in other states.

"There are great options. Try [https://www.byways.org/explore/states/ut](https://www.byways.org/explore/states/ut) or [https://www.visitutah.com/things-to-do/road-trips/scenic-byways](https://www.visitutah.com/things-to-do/road-trips/scenic-byways) for some inspiration. I'm a fan of the loop of: up Parley's Canyon to East Canyon and back down via Emigration Canyon (2 hours or so?). I prefer the loop in that direction because the truck drivers in Parley's Canyon are often not ready for the grade of the canyon and make dumb choices while heading downhill. Rte. 89 is pretty, especially between Logan and Bear Lake (Garden City), but that might be a bit too far for a day trip. Up past Park City there are very beautiful drives all the way to the state border along Rte. 40/191, and plenty of nice stops to make along the way.  Mt. Timpanogus and Mt. Nebo are also beautiful; but, some of those canyon roads are very narrrow and very steep. At the time you're here, the conditions might not be great. YMMV.  

While trip planning, double check on road closures and conditions (UDOT and the Park Service rangers may be the most factual information?). Especially at higher elevations, there can be snow or ice on the road (or gravel washouts) well into June, and many of the routes will present you with skill challenges that you may need to consider, like finding a fallen boulder on the road just after a hairpin turn.  Some routes are also closed until mid-May. Mirror Lake Highway/Rte. 150 jumps to mind for that concern. 

As for weather, be aware that the altitude difference from NYC can really be a whammy in terms of general hydration and how hard a roadside stop for a beer will hit you. The ski resorts are pretty, but they also tend to be at 7-10k feet above sea level, and this is a desert state. Temperatures can vary quite a bit as you go up and down (think about 20 degrees F as a rule of thumb).

That‚Äôs tax money that Utah is missing out on. Plus, public opinion continues to favor marijuana legalization more and more and many states are favored to legalize in the 2024 elections.

"To move something along that the legislative branch didn't act on or was slow to act.  Examples:

* Medical marijuana got done faster because of Prop 2.  In 2016 the state got close to passing medical marijuana via [SB 73](https://le.utah.gov/%7E2016/bills/static/sb0073.html).  In 2018 it was allowed for terminally ill patients via [HB 195](https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/hb0195.html), and cultivation via [HB 197](https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/hb0197.html, and cannaboid oil via [SB 130](https://le.utah.gov/~2018/bills/static/sb0130.html).  But the process likely would have taken years long had Prop 2 not forced the issue.   

* Medicaid expansion happened because of Prop 3.  The legislative branch had to fix up budget problem so it actually paid for itself, as Prop 3 had a huge contradiction in itself.

* School vouchers didn't happen due to a 2007 initiative vote, and it still affects the voucher talk today.

* The primary system now allows signatures, after a voter initiative almost went on the ballot to remove party caucuses entirely.  

The initiative process is *hated* by social media.

"Yes, that's always my first stop. I found some but I was hoping locals might have some other suggestions. I'm not great at finding books unless they've got my keywords in the title.

*Wind in the Rock: The Canyonlands of Southeastern Utah* by Ann Zwinger looks good. It's probably the one I'll go with.

*Desert Solitaire* by Edward Abbey is also a popular recommendation but some people find the author a bit abrasive. I guess the book goes into a lot of his philosophy.

*A History of Utah's American Indians* by Forrest S. Cuch seems to be the most recommended book on native history, although it seems like it's quite in depth and I doubt I'd be able to get through it.

"I have the feeling that you are mislabeling the arguments of ""the rich are not paying the value they should be"" and ""the rich are not paying anything.""

The rich should pay more, significantly more, because they benefit significantly more from our system. This is why they fight so hard to keep it.

But you're also not exactly making the argument you think you're making.

The top **1%** makes **21%** of ALL **income**. The **BOTTOM 50%** barely makes half of the top 1%. That's 50 times more people making half the amount of money. Not 50 more people. 50 times more people.

So not only do the rich get paid almost twice as much, live in a way that is less costly (being poor is really expensive). The impact of that taxation on their day to day life is 0, while poor people can make huge improvements in their life with smaller amounts of money back in their pockets.

The question isn't whether he reduced one group more than another, because the change isn't equal. It's a false equivalence. Reducing 10% of low wage earners money is a huge difference to those people. Lowering .04% makes no difference, but still significantly reduces our tax income.",t2_29ev6,quickhorn,0,1648839032.0,0,t1_i30n7qn,i30n7qn,False,inthelu2,t3_ttdikb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/ttdikb/mitt_romney_suggests_hed_back_cutting_retirement/,Mitt Romney Suggests He'd Back Cutting Retirement Benefits for Younger Americans,/r/Utah/comments/ttdikb/mitt_romney_suggests_hed_back_cutting_retirement/i30n7qn/,3,r/Utah,0,3

"> the US is a Constitutional Republic.

I agree.

> If you want to delve into the whole fun debate Mike Lee kicked off on this subject,

This discussion did not start with Mike Lee. The debate between democracy and republic predates the Union.

> The Trib carried a good opinion piece discussing why Mike Lee's statement shows he is actually against Democracy,

Cool. I want my Senator to be against democracy. I don‚Äôt like democracy.

> and the Vox article I linked in my post has a good discussion about why the controversy matters, including referring to Mike Lee's reasoning as an ""intellectual scaffolding for a constitutional disaster,"" because in 2020, people were worried about a peaceful transfer of power.

I‚Äôm not sure I follow. How has Mike Lee contributed to the distrust in American elections?

> The Vox piece has a good explanation for why the very right-wing types like Lee who use statements by the Founding Fathers to argue against Democracy do not have standing:

> Nowadays, the terms ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and ‚Äúrepublic‚Äù generally refer to different kinds of things in comparative political science. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù contrasts with ‚Äúauthoritarianism,‚Äù referring to whether the head of government (who makes policy) is chosen in free and fair elections.

I hope you can see the disconnect between your statement and the Vox quote. The conservative take particular issue with democracy and then the liberal attempts to redefine democracy as simply anti-authoritarianism. From my conservative lens, I completely disagree that democracy and authoritarianism are mutually exclusive. Throughout history, democracy has a peculiar tendency to involve authoritarianism.

> It's relevant to Utah now, as those of us who want everyone to be able to vote and have a say in our government (Democrats usually) are being disenfranchised by those who are increasingly in the minority

"His main argument is about the debt, but Social Security doesn't need to be involved whatsoever with the debt. I don't know the current legal landscape, but perhaps we could pass a bill that states Social Security and Medicare are completely self-funded by the FICA taxes and that those funds can only be used for those programs?

If we do that, the only options left are to increase revenue, decrease benefits, or completely restructure the program. Of those three, I'd much rather go with the third. I think we should investigate replacing Social Security with a negative income tax, where there's no cap and money only goes to people who earn under a certain amount (based on some standard of living estimate and adjusted for inflation).

I think the entire Social Security system is awkwardly structured. It's overly complicated IMO, and there's no reason for high earners to receive SS benefits.

"Get ready for a rant! Lol 

My dating age range is 30-42. I'm turning 37. I've nicknamed this place Salt Flake City.

The ghosting culture here is next-level. I get that ghosting is a thing, but here??? 
The ghosting I'm used to is me making plans with someone and them being iffy and unsure then cancelling. 

Here *other* people will readily make plans, tell you how ""excited"" they are to meet you, then change their minds an hour before hand. I'm not talking about ""I'm not feeling well, I may have COVID let me stay home"". That at least says that they care. These MFers will be like ""eh, I just don't feel like it"", ""a friend of mine needs me to come see them"", or ""I've decided I'm doing something else instead"". And those are the ones who actually respond. 
This has happened to me SO many times, the second someone tells me they're excited to see me, I just shut down because I know they're going to flake. 

People here are socialized to not GAF about anyone else's time but their own. If a person has lived in Utah about 4 years or longer whether they're LDS or not, just expect that to happen. It got so bad that I just started dating long distance. I'd also date anyone who was a recent arrival, but I decided in December that I'm over it which is why I have zero interest in dating now. I've lived in cities where people treat each other better. 

As a sidenote, that's not just in dating. People regularly ghost as friends, too. Meetup App is great because you're meeting *groups* of people. 

At any rate, I wouldn't recommend moving here if you're single and looking for a healthy LTR.",t2_7zi31vfx,Roulixthewiser,0,1648816476.0,0,t1_i2z4u9l,i2z4u9l,False,sic-et-non,t3_tt7s6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/tt7s6d/thinking_about_moving_how_friendly_is_utah_to/,Thinking about moving: how friendly is Utah to non-LDS or LDS-lite people?,/r/Utah/comments/tt7s6d/thinking_about_moving_how_friendly_is_utah_to/i2z4u9l/,2,r/Utah,0,2

But no... republicans refuse to raise taxes on top earners who already pay a lower overall tax rate than the average middle class family thanks to laws like this that protect the wealthy over everyone else. The rich just keep getting richer while the majority of people drown in higher costs of living and stagnant wages that have failed to keep up with inflation for nearly 4 decades now. Social safety nets are failing because the GOP keeps sabotaging them. They keep pushing for lower taxes for the wealthy and offer up only cuts to social programs to help balance it.",t2_7e0lvnfc,Helgafjell4Me,0,1648785111.0,0,t1_i2xw7bc,i2xw7bc,True,inthelu2,t3_ttdikb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/ttdikb/mitt_romney_suggests_hed_back_cutting_retirement/,Mitt Romney Suggests He'd Back Cutting Retirement Benefits for Younger Americans,/r/Utah/comments/ttdikb/mitt_romney_suggests_hed_back_cutting_retirement/i2xw7bc/,33,r/Utah,0,33

A day at Grand view point, three days in the Needles, and three days around the Maze/Orange Cliffs. That's 7 days just in one park and I feel like there's still tons to do. I could have added two days driving the White Rim trail and another 2-3 days hiking to the Doll House in the Maze. I could happily spend a week in Zion alone.

"1. Democracy. Mike Lee is part of the Republican party that believes that the election was stolen and that the Republicans should control election results. His focus on pushing forward national voting rights standards will give democrats the tools to fight the anti-democratic voter suppression the GOP is doing.
2. Queer Issues - Basically where the democrats land right now on most social issues is where I understand he lands. The idea that religious rights should be respected, but not at the expense of others' beliefs.

On the caucusing side, I believe you absolutely have a great point. Evan has regularly insisted he will not caucus with Republicans if they continue to not support the transition of power and passing voting rights for everyone. He hasn't declared he'll caucus with Democrats either.

How do you know that Schumer and McConnell won't put him in committees? 

The last question that you ask is the one that I feel the most important to address, though.

It reduces the chance of a Republican senate. This increases the chance of keeping Trump out of power, and for helping our queer kids stay alive.

Some of us just don't have 10 years to wait for Utah to become more purple. We need small actions now that will ultimately result better in anything Mike Lee would put down.

Yes, what Kael is offering is better. But we're not going to get it. After what Mike Lee has already done, and still has the support he has, we're not swapping people to Kael from Mike. But they may be willing to go to Evan.

Utah's not purple, and its recent redistricting will not do any favors down ballot for Kael to run. But if Evan builds a coalition and our down-ballot candidates can add to his coalition message, they have a higher chance of getting the vote out in there areas of people that are anti-Lee. (and he has agreed to this, but hasn't followed through with at least one candidate I know of, but that's mostly cause it's not really campaigning season yet).

Yes, I would love for the heroes to win. But I'll absolutely take an improvement in the villain over the same thing we have always had.

"Yes, that's a good point that you'll get the ballot for the party to which you are affiliated. This is why if you are registered as a Republican and want to vote in a Democratic primary, you need to  call the your county clerk before the election and ask for a Democratic ballot.

You can't vote in multiple primaries *in the same election*, so in my 2020 example, a registered Republican could not have requested a Democratic ballot, voted for Elizabeth Warren, then somehow acquired a Republican ballot and voted for Donald Trump.  But you will not usually be able to get the both a Republican and a Democratic ballot anyway, leastways without pulling some shenanigans, so you probably don't need to worry about doing it by accident.

In Utah, Democratic primaries rarely make enough impact to be worth voting in.  Like for this senate election, you could vote in the Democratic primary for Kael Weston or whichever unknown decides to run against him, but neither of them is going to get over 10% of the vote in the general election in November.

"If you want to debate semantics, the US is a Constitutional Republic. If you want to delve into the whole fun debate Mike Lee kicked off on this subject, [The Guardian's](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/08/republican-us-senator-mike-lee-democracy) article collected several other politician's reactions to Lee's inflammatory statements, The [Trib](https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2021/03/12/george-pyle-why-mike-lee/) carried a good opinion piece discussing why Mike Lee's statement shows he is actually against Democracy, and the [Vox](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/21507713/mike-lee-democracy-republic-trump-2020) article I linked in my post has a good discussion about why the controversy matters, including referring to Mike Lee's reasoning as an ""intellectual scaffolding for a constitutional disaster,"" because in 2020, people were worried about a peaceful transfer of power.    

The Vox piece has a good explanation for why the very right-wing types like Lee who use statements by the Founding Fathers to argue against Democracy do not have standing: 

>In short, what we call ‚Äúrepresentative democracy‚Äù today ‚Äî a system of government where people elect leaders to make policy ‚Äî is what the founders called a ‚Äúrepublic.‚Äù Their attacks on ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù in the Athenian sense does not mean that America is not a democracy in the contemporary sense.

>Nowadays, the terms ‚Äúdemocracy‚Äù and ‚Äúrepublic‚Äù generally refer to different kinds of things in comparative political science. ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù contrasts with ‚Äúauthoritarianism,‚Äù referring to whether the head of government (who makes policy) is chosen in free and fair elections. ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù contrasts with ‚Äúmonarchy,‚Äù referring to whether the head of state (the symbolic leader of the nation) comes from a hereditary line of succession. 

The debate that begins with semantics leads to a broader one about attitudes toward government today.  It's relevant to Utah now, as those of us who want everyone to be able to vote and have a say in our government (Democrats usually) are being disenfranchised by those who are increasingly in the minority.",t2_5shpuhct,FreakWith17PlansADay,0,1648758514.0,0,t1_i2w7r3c,i2w7r3c,False,FreakWith17PlansADay,t3_tt39im,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/tt39im/today_is_your_last_chance_to_register_as_a/,TODAY is your last chance to register as a Republican to vote in the Primaries!,/r/Utah/comments/tt39im/today_is_your_last_chance_to_register_as_a/i2w7r3c/,8,r/Utah,0,8

"I don't think that's a fair assessment of McMullin's camp or many of his actual policy positions. He just hammers his democracy stump speech because it likely resonates the most with disaffected Republicans that are likely to leave Lee for an Independent, but wouldn't vote for a Democrat.

I think that putting the party above policy is pitting politics above values. We're so used to compromising on values, that we have a chance to align on highly important values, in contrast with incredibly terrible values, but we can't because they have the wrong letter next to their name?

Not running a candidate to defer to McMullin is the kind of compromise that will help reduce the chance that McConnell gets to rule the senate and refuse to govern.

I feel it's our chance to enable the split of the Republican party. And if the new Republican party takes governing seriously, is focused on real small government, and small measured improvements, then the Democrats can start becoming a progressive party and leave the center-right politics to the Republicans.

">Utah Lake‚Äôs recovery is now a top priority for state leaders, but how to restore it has become a bone of contention, pitting scientists, Native Americans and environmentalists against real estate developers who say they can dredge the lake back to health.

...

>Growing up here, Holdaway heard stories about the Native Americans who once roamed the valley and survived on abundant fish pulled from the lake.

>‚ÄúI just thought it was so strange that they lived here, yet nobody around here knew that they were here and that this was their land,‚Äù says Holdaway during a recent visit to the family‚Äôs property. ‚ÄúI knew they would build these shelters called wickiups. When I was little kid, I‚Äôd be like, ‚ÄòOh, I‚Äôm going down to the property and I‚Äôm going to build a wickiup.‚Äô‚Äù

>Holdaway is the visionary behind Walkara Way, a proposed nature preserve on 1,000 acres of private land along the shore. By stitching together a series of easements, he hopes to develop a public-access pathway between Provo and Vineyard, part of a 98-mile trail that someday would encircle the entire lake.

...

>The plan is to plant up to 5,000 trees, build three miles of trail, reestablish wetlands with the help of artificial beaver dams and construct raptor nests. Holdaway also wants to put cows on the land to knock back the phragmites, the 10-foot-high invasive reeds choking the shorelines.

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to have any deer, we‚Äôre not going to have any elk come back at the levels that we need to maintain a healthy ecosystem. They‚Äôre just not going to come back,‚Äù says Holdaway, who lives on the family‚Äôs original homestead beside Shadrach Holdaway‚Äôs still-standing tiny historic home, surrounded by rapidly expanding subdivisions and a golf course.

>‚ÄúThe dairy farmers went bankrupt between 1998 and 2003,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúSo there‚Äôs no hoofed animals to send down there to have a natural cleaning.‚Äù

>To demonstrate cattle can get the job done at minimal cost, he turned 30 head onto 50 fenced acres last year. After about three months, most of the phragmites were gone. Holdaway was not in it for the money, but the rancher who owned the cattle paid him $1,500.

...

>Rushforth and other scientists who study the lake reject this characterization of the lake‚Äôs condition, arguing current restoration efforts ‚Äî like phragmites and carp removal along with habitat restoration ‚Äî are working. Endangered June suckers are rebounding and algal blooms are declining, except in Provo Bay.

>‚ÄúThe lake restoration people are doing their best to spread, to deepen the negative narrative,‚Äù Rushforth says. ‚ÄúThe lake is not toxic. The lake is not deeply polluted. The lake has lots of nutrients and always has had. The lake is very productive and always will be.‚Äù

>The company behind the Utah Lake Restoration Project argues the lake is terminally ill due to accumulated pollutants in lakebed sediments. It proposes deepening the lake by 7 feet and sequestering the contaminated sediments into 34 new islands, some of which would be developed. According to the promotional literature, the result would be a clear, clean lake with beaches and navigable water for recreation.

>What dredging proponents call ‚Äúrestoration,‚Äù however, Mary Murdock Meyer describes as desecration of a sacred place. Her people may no longer live in Utah Valley, but she says they deserve a say in what happens to the lake that sustained their ancestors.

>Like the endangered June suckers, the Timpanogos ‚Äúhave endured near extinction and deserve to live,‚Äù Meyer says. ‚ÄúThink about tomorrow and the future generations. We, as native people, say you must look ahead seven generations when making decisions because what we decide today affects future generations.‚Äù",t2_10tmvp,Insultikarp,0,1648750495.0,0,t1_i2vn0yd,i2vn0yd,True,Insultikarp,t3_tt5vtg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utah/comments/tt5vtg/how_utah_lake_once_sustained_tribes_and_mormon/,How Utah Lake once sustained tribes and Mormon pioneers and why it needs help,/r/Utah/comments/tt5vtg/how_utah_lake_once_sustained_tribes_and_mormon/i2vn0yd/,1,r/Utah,0,1

"I definitely agree!  I was a poll worker in the early 2000's when the Republican party first decided to close their Primaries.  There were so many angry and frustrated people, especially those who had been Independents their whole lives and were very proud of not affiliating with either party. They had to either sign a paper on the spot registering as a Republican or not vote.  And now people can't even get a ballot if they're not registered three months before!

The hurdles the Republican party in this state keeps placing in front of Utahns to disenfranchise those who would disagree with them are disheartening.  This year making the deadline to change voter registration so early before the Primary, and making people who would challenge an incumbent have to get so many tens of thousands of signatures (forty percent of which get rejected) has been very discouraging.

"I'd go to Capitol Reef. It's a national park for a reason. There are four days worth of hiking trails within a 30 minute drive of the visitor center. The others are relatively short hikes in an open desert, that isn't terribly scenic in an of itself. 

Hole in the Rock Road, where the slots are located, will be an hour down the dirt road that could be in any sort of shape depending on when it last rained and when it was last graded. There isn't cell service a few miles deep. 

About five years back, I had a friend whose SUV broke down on the road, but luckily had other friends caravaning. It was an extremely expensive tow back into Escalante. I think about $1,000 if I remember correctly. 

Also, if you have low clearance you may need to add hiking time if you can't pull all the way to the trailhead. They don't grade off road and the spurs to the trailheads can be rutted out pretty deep so that a 2WD car couldn't reasonably navigate it.

"IN Utah, there are two paths to the primary ballot: Party Convention and Signature gathering. 

The convention rules vary between the parties and from year to year. AT The GOP convention, it is possible for one two two candidates to advance to the primary, depending on how the convention delegates vote.

Signature gathering requires that candidates gather and  have accepted 28,000 signatures. These signatures must be certified by the state election office. If they are, the candidate will appear on their designated party's primary ballot. The original law that created the signature path to the primary stipulated that these signatures could be from any eligible voter and that anyone could vote in either of the party's primary elections. The GOP, however, sued the state, arguing thus requirement infringed on its right to free association and won. As a result, GOP signatures and primaries are closed to non-registered Republicans. The DRC process is not closed; however, an elector can only vote in one of the primaries and may only sign for a single candidate to appear on a primary ballot.

"Cut out day 7. 

Arches: Get to the park EARLY and avoid not being let in due to crowds. Lots of short hikes with big bang for your buck. for a less crowded but amazing hike try Tower Arch. It's a dirt road to get to the trailhead and not in the more popular parts of the park, but the hike is really cool and the arch at the end is awesome. The short hike down Park Avenue is also often overlooked but really cool.

Canyonlands: Canyonlands is awesome. Island in the Sky is the part of the park right next to Arches. Mesa Arch at sunrise is crowded but do it anyway. It's stunning. Lots of great viewpoints, hike a bit along Grand View Point... If you have a high clearance AWD or 4x4, drive the Schaefer Trail road back to Moab. This is one of the best things we've done in Canyonlands. Dead Horse Point is fine, but I'd skip it, personally.

Capitol Reef: My favorite of the 5. With just one day, though, I'd have a tough time choosing what to do. One thing we love to do down there is drive the ""waterpocket fold loop"". You can find guides in town that point out things to see/do at various mileage points. If you time it right, you can get to Boulder and eat at Hell's Backbone Grill, perhaps the best restaurant in all of Utah. The loop takes up most of the day. In lieu of that, be sure to do the scenic drive and go past the pavement on the dirt road to the very end. There's a small hike down there that's fun even if you don't go all the way. Cassidy Arch is an awesome hike. Better than Hickman Bridge, IMO. Cohab Canyon trail is another favorite... it's a steep beginning and then you're in this super cool mini canyon that has a couple little slots along the side that are fun to explore. There's also a trail up there that hooks up with a couple overlooks of the valley that aren't long and have a good payoff. 

Skip Goblin Valley and Bentonite Hills this time. You'll want a full day for Capitol Reef.

Bryce: You'll have time to do the scenic drive and hit all the stops, which is cool, and also the Navajo / queens loop. Bryce really comes alive when you get down into the hoodoos on the Navajo trail. It's great!

(At this point I'll just point out that you've missed the Needles district of Canyonlands, which is unfortunate, but there's just not time in your schedule unfortunately. But put it on your list for a future visit. It's less crowded and has some of the best hikes.)

Zion: I have no real advice here. I've been a couple times but not for 8 years or so, mostly because I'm crowd-avoidant. Hiking Angel's landing is a thrill for sure and definitely the memory that sticks out for me.

Good luck with all the planning! Sounds like an amazing trip. You're going to have a great time no matter what you choose to do.
