"As individual people they really are fine if you get to know them but one of my issues with them is I don’t don’t agree with their ethics regarding animals

I heard a very interesting take on the amish from a woman who was formerly amish and had been abused, she said that they didn’t use to be so anti-education but over time that became their thing and now it’s the uneducated leading the uneducated.  
https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2020/01/14/amish-sexual-abuse-assault/  
“There’s no one reason for the sexual abuse crisis in Amish Country. Instead, there’s a perfect storm of factors: a patriarchal and isolated lifestyle in which victims have little exposure to police, coaches, or anyone else who might help them; an education system that ends at eighth grade and fails to teach children about sex or their bodies; a culture of victim shaming and blaming; little access to the technology that enables communication or broader social awareness; and a religion that prioritizes repentance and forgiveness over actual punishment or rehabilitation. Amish leaders also tend to be wary of law enforcement, preferring to handle disputes on their own.”",t2_89051im2,Constant-Hurry-9453,0,1649008027.0,0,t1_i38y33t,i38y33t,True,baakhari,t3_tv20ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/tv20ve/amish_in_general/,Amish In General,/r/lancaster/comments/tv20ve/amish_in_general/i38y33t/,2,r/lancaster,0,2
"In my experience, they're just like any other sufficiently large group of people in that there are friendly and unfriendly, good and bad, etc. all within the population.

I certainly wouldn't treat any of them any differently than any other person until after I'd gotten to know the individual, regardless of my thoughts on the group as a whole.

That being said, I have almost no interaction with the Amish, but what little portion my life intersects with them, I'm not a fan.

I'm a fisherman. And the primary way I've been exposed to the Amish has been in fishing. *In my experience* (which may not be what all Amish do), I guess their beliefs dictate that every fish they catch is a gift from god and they aren't to waste it.

What this becomes is that they keep *every fish they catch*, regardless of the fishing laws, sizing limits, or numbers limits. Anything too small for the table is ground up to fertilize gardens or feed animals or something.

While I can appreciate the whole ""don't let anything go to waste"" approach, it's infuriating because generally they don't bother to get a fishing license, and they're fishing for fish that are stocked and managed through license sale funds, and removing fish at an unsustainable rate, in violation of the regulations, citing religious reasons. 

After watching some of them talking home a bucket of probably 50-100 undersized fish I asked a fish warden about it and basically I guess the law enforcement let's them get away with it because they don't want to be seen as a big bad government persecuting the peaceful Amish for practicing their religion. So all the other anglers get to buy licenses to fund the state's fisheries and then they come in without contributing and take far more than their fair share, against the regs, and nobody does anything about it.

So for those specific Amish that do that? Yeah fuck them.",t2_6p0x8,hydrospanner,0,1649006519.0,0,t1_i38udce,i38udce,True,baakhari,t3_tv20ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/tv20ve/amish_in_general/,Amish In General,/r/lancaster/comments/tv20ve/amish_in_general/i38udce/,1,r/lancaster,0,1

"Some notes on the amish as someone who has lived here forever: 
1. The food they make is fantastic; you should definitely try some traditional pennsylvania dutch food. 
2. They believe they are to be “in the world, but not of the world”. 
3. They work their children like adults (even being on worksites all day) and see no child labor law violation consequences 
4. They work their animals even harder, and operate puppy mills that are impossible to shut down 
5. There was an Amish school shooting in early/mid 2000 and there is probably some lasting distrust of English people in result. 
6. There is a time period in an Amish young man’s life called “rumspringa”. This means they have a certain period of time to be integrated into the world and do whatever they want. They do this in hopes that they will see how hard the real world is and return back to the Amish for the rest of their life. This is why you may see some Amish men doing things they normally wouldn’t like be in a bar, etc.",t2_6gkada7o,theproperbinge,0,1649005127.0,0,t1_i38qzcv,i38qzcv,True,baakhari,t3_tv20ve,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/tv20ve/amish_in_general/,Amish In General,/r/lancaster/comments/tv20ve/amish_in_general/i38qzcv/,0,r/lancaster,0,0

My issue is they want to live separate and apart from society. That’s great and is protected by the constitution bill of rights.   That doesn’t mean they should be politically active where their vote impacts other peoples right to exist.

"I think there are a lot of misconceptions about them. People expect them to be perfect, but they are just like anyone else. Some a nice and some are not. 

My grandfather was not Amish, but he very much had a mindset that children were more workhands than loved ones. I see some of that in my community and many children are running farm equipment, working in construction (even on top of buildings) at a very young age, and many times when children get hurt or even die it is swept under the rug. A few summers ago a very young child down from me was killed inside of a piece of machinery when his father asked him to crawl inside to fix it and he forgot to turn it off. Still some treat their children very well, and some will have expensive toys like RC planes. Over the summer it is fun to watch them fly the planes while I walk. One of the neighbor kids mows my lawn for $20 each week over the summer and his parents seem very caring. He also is very responsible, and it used to make me laugh when he was younger and would talk about going out with his coworkers. He absolutely has a huge sugar tooth and loves going to BBs for cheap candy, gum, and mountain dew.

"It's almost as if there's a war going on in Ukraine and the whole world has imposed economic sanctions on Russia who supplies the world with a lot of oil. We've stopped purchasing it to stop funding the war. Who helped Russia by withholding military defense weapons from Ukraine by trying to blackmail the Ukrainian president? Oh right, Trump. Also if you want to blame someone for the gas prices blame the gas companies. They could simply make less and not screw people over. The top 25 gas companies reported net profits of $205Bn last year.

Pushing a law for capping prices is a much better avenue.  Again, why didn't Trump do this within his first two years or push Congress to cap insulin?  Why didn't Lloyd?  When Trump and co had Congress on their side for two years, why didn't they enact laws to cap the cost of life saving medicine at the pharmaceutical level?

"Trump's Executive order would've reduced prices for a small number of people, so long as Trump was president.  Executive orders aren't laws.

This Bill proposal aims to reduce it for all americans, by law.

Biden also didn't single out this one executive order. Trump issued it on the 23rd, Biden froze it and others for review.  Why didn't Trump do this on day one of his presidency?  Trumps order did go into effect in July, but impacted almost no one.

  **Your article actually goes into length about what this order does, how it would stress clinics on poor areas, and essentially help nobody.  It's a very good review of why Trump's EO sucks.  Thanks for linking it!**

So no, both parties aren't the same. While I know most politicians can't be trusted, but GOP is so full of shit right now that the dems look angels in comparison. 

 Fact is, there's a perfectly good bill out and Lloyd voted no for partisan reasons.  His excuses will of course be over the distribution of 2 billion to insurance companies thatll raise insurance priemiums.

"Let's not forget about the adult movie theater! I always thought my parents were mean for not taking me and my sister to the movie theater at Park City when I was a kid. It wasn't until I was much older that I found out why!

There was a movie theater in Park City. And it showed X-rated films.  
From 1971 to 1985, you could catch a movie at Park City. The RKO Century Theater was a two-screen movie house located on the lower level of the mall. The first film shown there in 1971 was ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"" starring Warren Beatty and Julie Christie. By the end of its days, the theater was showing second-run films on one screen and X-rated movies on the other. The films showing on Aug. 11, 1985 - the theater's final day - were ""Nasty Lady"" on the adult side and ""Witness"" - the Harrison Ford film shot largely in Lancaster County - on the second-run side.

"Yea that's a perfect example of some of the early javascript homework. We often were given time in class to work on the homework. 

The first month is by far the hardest because of the steap learning curve. But you will start to get the hang of it and the more you learn the easier it will become to learn more code. 

Most homework is basically making small programs that solve math problems. Have a strong understanding of algebra is very helpful.

"Hey I am in my second semester as a freshman in CSET. Now it will depend on your teacher. But the software classes are 4 hours every day. Either the morning or afternoon class. Plus whatever Gen eds you have. Usually two classes each an hour, but those are usually two or three times a week. 

So maybe three days a week you will have about 6 hours of class and the other days atleast 4 hours. The amount of homework you will have depends on your teacher and how fast you are at picking it up. Some people really excel at coding and it can be fairly easy. 

Thaddeus stevens is a really easy college, as long as you put in effort and turn stuff in. It give yourself a head start, find some free coding lessons online and try them. Start with javascript or html, and css. Software is really fun, and there is a lot to learn. 

Oh and due to it being a two year program you spend about one month on each language. So it's pretty fast and you need to be proactive in your learning. But there are tutors, and classmates that can help each other.

"Hold up, the vaccine absolutely does affect transmission. People who are boosted are less likely to have symptomatic infections than those with two vaccine doses and especially those without any doses, although protection is less for Omicron than Delta. (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788485)

The vaccine isn’t air-tight (none are) and protection clearly wanes over time. That doesn’t mean it isn’t effective at slowing transmission. What we saw with the Omicron wave was the emergence of a new highly contagious variant at a time when protection from many poeples’ initial vaccine series was waning and booster rollout was slow.

While the primary benefit of the vaccine is the significant reduction in serious cases leading to hospitalization and/or death, a reduction in symptomatic infections is still beneficial, even if it’s not as strong as we’d all like. 

For sake of easy math, let’s say a vaccine cuts chances of infection in half and 10 people are exposed who each come into close contact with 10 people, who each come into contact with 10 people and so on. If all 10 are vaccinated, only five get sick, and they each only infect five and so on. So after five rounds of exposure that’s 3,125 people infected versus 100,000.

">You are a really angry person and I feel sorry for you. I am not stupid, and I’m not cursing at you, and I’m not forcing anything on you. 

Not angry, just upset at the dumbness for thinking that vaccination is a ""dividing"" thing for anyone because we've grown up with vaccinations, it's only because of the current and most recent ""ex"" that this has become a political thing.

I'm not swearing or forcing anything on anyone either. It's just when you can take simple and easy steps to prevent the spread of a easily preventable thing... and you don't think about the community or other people.

> You are really defensive for someone just blindly repeating things that you don’t even know if it’s true. 

Please, what am I not sure about being true?

>You don’t know why I don’t have it, just like I don’t know why you got it. Everyone has different opinions on things, but no one has the right to aggressively demand attention to their opinion.

I think you might be misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not saying you should be forced to get it. I'm saying that complaining about having a vaccine requirement for a convention (that's indoors), is stupid because it's legit protecting your community, and the larger Lancaster community.

Any reason to not get the vaccine, is a selfish one. I understand there are legitimate reasons to not get the vaccine, but the larger world seems to have forgotten that actions have consequences. Both good and bad.

If you don't want to get the vaccine, that's fine, realize that it's a selfish move (because you're only thinking about yourself)... And also realize that doing so is going to exclude you from certain things in the world because **we need to think about others.**",t2_ba34u,Cinemaslap1,0,1648390210.0,0,t1_i2bcheg,i2bcheg,False,RecordLegume,t3_tp84xp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/tp84xp/whats_going_on_tomorrow_spending_the_day_downtown/,What’s going on tomorrow?

Not to mention, with it being 40 degrees outside... be a bit cold for a lot of the cosplayers.

"I originally went because of 1 tooth had some sensitivity, so I thought I had a cavity and picked a dentist that was in my insurance and close to work and home. 

I ended up 6 sealants (re)done after the prelim exam, they were from my childhood and I guess were old? 3 corners of my mouth, all in one go. I'll admit the praying was odd, but given the religious makeup of Lancaster County, I guess it makes sense. There was a family of plain-sect that came in during a visit, so it must make people comfortable. End of the day, do what you want lol.

So now, 1 year later, I still have the issue I went in for and the sensitivity on everything else. I've been back a few times and they finally redid one side, maybe 2-3 teeth, with the medicated insert (think the girl said it was fluoride?). It's been better, but not completely fixed. Prior to redoing, they just gave me MI paste and prescription toothpaste with a buttload of fluoride in it. It was to a point where eating a salad was painful, and I guess I bitched enough.

I also got a night guard, teeth grinding. They also did the bottom one because my top wasn't good enough as well. Considering the quality, I guess it's worth $600, idk tho.

Now my husband is having similar issues with the sensitivity after fillings. He's got some other issues we're working through, but now it can't be just me and my sensitive teeth. I see Freedman got a few comments, so maybe we'll make a go with him soon.

Thanks for detailing your experiences. I'm kinda glad it's not just me.",t2_7l79wuhg,holemills,0,1648385011.0,0,t1_i2b2p59,i2b2p59,False,fleetfoxesarcadefire,t3_tlubxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/tlubxa/dentist_recommendations/,Dentist Recommendations?,/r/lancaster/comments/tlubxa/dentist_recommendations/i2b2p59/,1,r/lancaster,0,1

"Yes renters Ins covers in the event of uninhabitable building Eg a fire etc. so maybe in your case. 

Not a lawyer but while your LL may be a jerk I doubt you have a solid legal case where you state it’s dangerous and therefore uninhabitable yet you get to stay in it a little longer. You want to stay for convenience but that’s not a typical lease term. 

I’m a landlord but no property in PA.  I require renters ins in the lease so tenants have a place to stay if something happens out of my control.

"Thank you for your question; I appreciate it. 😊

There's a leak in the ceiling / roof in our only hallway that has been there for several months - and there's evidence it may well have already been there before we moved in - and it may be affecting the electric wiring (plus all the dangers that come with a leak / water problem). 

The reason we need more time to move out is that we're in the process of planning a move overseas, and 30 days is not enough to do that in.  We don't want to stay indefinitely, we just want to be able to plan our overseas move properly.  

Thank you for the information about renter's insurance.

"Trying to find it  online, but each MDJ office has a book for the public related to landlord/tenant stuff that outlines rules and laws they're meant to follow. I would highly suggest going to your local MDJ and grabbing one of those, assuming you haven't already, and go over it to see what is applicable to your situation. If they do file, you are also likely heading to that same MDJ office so its a good chance just to get familiar where that is so you don't end up late to the hearing if it does in fact happen.

"Absolutely! So, I had 2 cavities which they filled, usually when I have a cavity filled (which I've had plenty, thanks genetics) Ill be sensitive for a week and then I'm normal. I had sensitivity and pain for 2 months after. I decided to call back, got an exam, and they agreed to redo it free of charge. Originally it was Dr. Baird who did the work, she assigned another dentist in office to fix it. They told me to give it another two months. Which I did, and it was still painful/sensitive. They ground down some of the filling but said they couldn't grind anymore down. They said they can totally redo it a third time. I just stopped going and got a second opinion. Which I am glad I did - my new dentist said there was plenty of filling left to grind down for temporary relief (which they did, and pain did lessen but not 100% resolve) and I will be going in soon for another re-do, though this office says they insert a medication into the tooth before sealing to promote healing. Gonna give it a shot. And honestly, there were other red flags there too at Po like 1.) I paid 600$ for a night guard, which I told them I need molded to my top teeth because I have a permanent retainer on my bottom, and after attempting for over an HOUR to get a mold of my teeth, they said the got it, once they had my money and my guard came in, it was for my bottom teeth. They did it without telling me because 'my top teeth were too hard to work with'. Also 2.) She prayed over me after not 1 but 2 appointments. Which if you are Christian may be nice? Im not sure. But she asked, which I admit I did give permission, but I was caught so off guard and did not want to cause an issue by saying no.

"In times past there was

- basically the entire current RRTA system of routes and then some was trolleys, mostly along the turpikes radiating out of the city but also on some of their own ROW.  Connected directly to the Hershey, Reading, and Coatesville systems such that it was possible to ride trolleys from Philadelphia all the way to Harrisburg.

- the existing electrified Amtrak/PRR line (Harrisburg, Portsmouth, Mount Joy, and Lancaster Railroad + Philadelphia and Columbia RR)

- the currently freight-only Lancaster & Columbia Line (continued to Wrightsville and York over the world's longest covered bridge), used to be electrified and carry passengers

- The current freight line (Reading and Columbia line) to East Pete, Manheim, and Lititz went all the way through Ephrata to Sinking Springs and Reading, and in the other direction to Silver Spring, Columbia, and Marietta.  The Reading Railroad station was located near Prince and James street.

- Cornwall Railroad went from Manheim through Penryn, Mt Hope, and Cornwall to Lebanon, mainly to serve the iron mines (which go back to the Baron von Stiegel who founded Manheim).  The current YMCA Camp Shand/Rocky Creek was the company park/picnic spot.

- The Cornwall and Lebanon Railroad paralleled this line, and even raced passenger trains, from Lebanon to Cornwall, then continued on to Elizabethtown.  Mt. Gretna was their company park and picnic spot, including the lake.  The current hiking trail up Governor Dick was was a 2ft narrow gauge line up to the observation tower.

- The current New Holland freight branch went all the way to another junction of PRR lines at Honey Brook

- PRR went directly through downtown roughly along New Holland ave and Harrisburg ave with the station on Queen and Walnut St.  A branch went right down the middle of water street down to Quarryville.

- The Enola low grade line from Parkesburg/Atglen/Quarryville/Safe Harbor, didn't carry passengers but was electrified and connected to the Quarryville branch

- The Lancaster Oxford and Southern narrow gauge railroad connected Quarryville to Peach Bottom and Oxford.

- The current Safe Harbor line along the Susquehanna used to be electrified and carried passengers into the Amtrak era until the National Limted was cancelled

- and the Strasburg Railroad

"The Conestoga is reasonably clean despite being muddy, the Susquehanna is a lot worse - mine tailings, industrial waste, heavy metals, untreated sewage, and more even though the water looks more clear.  And the Susquehanna I think is a lot better than the Schuylkill and other rivers to the east. 

Lancaster city water is taken out of the creek up by the PRR stone arch bridge by the 23 bypass, all the sewer/stormwater overflows are below that point which are only a problem during storms, the treated water comes out down by Danville next to the sewer plant and is quite clean.  They keep track of the total flow up by the water works and monitor all the contaminant levels, but, like I said, that's above the problem spots.  They must test it at least once in a while below because they do put up warnings sometimes in the county park when they say it's bad.

"The signs greatly exaggerate the risk. As for removing the sewer overflows, that’s not really feasible. The city uses can treat 32 million gallons of water a day and that all has to go somewhere. For smaller municipalities things like ground application work great but that’s impossible for the amount we produce, so it goes back into the river where it came from, after being fully treated and disinfected. The real issue comes from the city’s combined sewer and storm water systems. This causes untreated waste to bypass the treatment plants during storms. The city has actually go a lonnnng way to separate storm and sanitary sewers! They’ve also installed all the rain gardened down town and incentivized homeowner to do the same. You’re honestly more at risk from manure/fertilizer and pesticide run off then the cso’s.   If you have sensitive skin, have a compromised immune system or are a young child or are old by all means avoid the water but even after heavy rains there’s very low risk.

"So the Progress Flag was released in June 2018 by Daniel Quasar. The main section of the flag includes the traditional 6 stripe LGBTQIA+ flag as seen in its widely adopted form so as not to take away from its original meaning. The trans flag and marginalized community stripes were shifted to the Hoist of the flag and given a new arrow shape. The arrow points to the right to show forward movement, while being along the left edge shows that progress still needs to be made. As a Trans man, I like this added part. While the T in LGBT does stand for Transgender, oftentimes transgender people feel excluded from the LGBT community due to our sexual orientation not necessarily being what makes us different, but instead our gender not matching our assigned gender at birth. There has also been a long history of transphobia within the LGBQIA+ community. Over the past few years the transphobia has decreased but it is still an issue. Same goes with racism. You’d think with the LGBTQIA+ community being a marginalized community, there wouldn’t be any discrimination towards other marginalized communities, but of course that’s unfortunately not the way it works.",t2_3ru0s2op,Cptp93,0,1647891047.0,0,t1_i1khmue,i1khmue,False,Cptp93,t3_tjg50m,https://www.reddit.com/r/lancaster/comments/tjg50m/progress_flag/,Progress Flag 🏳️‍🌈,/r/lancaster/comments/tjg50m/progress_flag/i1khmue/,9,r/lancaster,0,9

"According to the Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority, only glass jars and glass bottles can be recycled (just talking about plain glass here). So your best bet is to put the sheets of glass in a blanket, break it up, and throw it in the trash. Here's a link to an informational video by LCSWMA about disposing of glass material. https://vimeo.com/470215036 They don't explicitly say what to do with large sheets of glass, though.

Here's an additional link about recycling in Lancaster. [https://recyclerightlancaster.org](https://recyclerightlancaster.org)

Judges have so much power and are basically accountable to no one. There is some oversight at the state level but they only intervene in the most insane cases. They are theoretically able to be voted out of office but I wonder how often that happens in this state. There was that judge that got pulled over and pulled rank to get out of a traffic ticket. There is another judge at the Lancaster country court that just berates and yells at attorneys on both sides and is super unprofessional and rude. Constitutional rights and justice mean nothing if a judge can just do whatever they want with no accountability.
