"I feel the exact same way about my neighbor, but it's completely vice versa. 
I have a rottweiler, my nextdoor neighbor has one of those little white dogs. 

I have caught her dog shitting in my backyard multiple times and when I go out to tell him to go back to his own yard, he comes barking and snapping at me and my dog. He does this so often that I have multiple videos of her dog shitting in my backyard. Her dog doesn't SCARE me, it's probably 10lbs all together, but still.... My dog also wouldn't hurt it, but I don't want him blamed for some shit just because he looks like a bully breed. He is consistently leashed in our own yard. 

Keeping in mind to not always jump to bylaw, I went over

1) to introduce myself, and 2) ask of maybe she can keep a better eye on him, that I have a big dog that is very social, and I know he can be startling to some, and that my dog tries to roll in her dogs shit in my yard almost daily. 


I was met with ""call the fucking bylaw""

Now EVERYTIME I go out in my backyard to play with my dog, she lets hers out to bark at us the entire time, it's almost like she waits and listens for when we are outside. 
But get this, she times it. Bylaw has told her that she can't let it bark for more than 15 minutes continuous. She leaves it out for 14 minutes EVERY. TIME.

"i watched a homeless guy running around the train tracks in broad daylight with his pants off grabbing his dick and shouting obscenities while people just watched and laughed.

another time i watched a homeless guy literally choose and approach every woman (more likely to give) in the bus depot for ""change for the bus"" despite being offered by someone to have a bus ride paid for.

what else... a homeless person sexually assaulted a very young female YMCA volunteer who was like not even 18 as she was trying to show him where the shower was in 2021. It went un-reported and he got away with it. the same guy was outside the downtown shoppers drug mart two weeks ago with a huge stick, dirty clothes, looked high and a bunch of bags on the ground, threatening anyone who got close to where he was standing. So in the last year and 3 months that man has done nothing to improve his situation and is getting away with crimes. whatever

"Throwing them out is temporary. Keeping them out is permanent. A solution.

It takes resources to do both of the above.

Our ""incompetent"" City council has provided a lot more than paltry pittances.

ODSP is $1100 a month at the minimum. $623 for OW. Food banks provide 100+$ dollars of food every month. The soup kitchen does free meals everyday which also has a value of about 5$ per day. The Sudbury housing corporation provides thousands of people below-market rent AND will pay out cash to people who have do pay market rent and is on average $250 per month. Passport funding will provides community participation and activities of daily living and, MORE cash up $2500 a month, which could total up to $30,000 a year tax free.

So how is that a pittance?

to break that down for ya that's

$1100(ODSP) + $100(foodbank) +  $155 (free meals 5$ a day x 30 days is $155) + $250 (housing) + $2,500 (passport funding) = $4,105a month of potential income for a homeless, jobless, person in Sudbury.

https://www.l-camera-forum.com/topic/289385-transfer-digital-images-to-35mm-film/

Apparently  it is possible  , if you got it on 35mm black white I could  do it you would  need a couple  sheets  of extra  flim and large enough  tub of developer, and you may lose a little  resolution  

Step on: use an enlarge  to project  the 35mm image  on to piece  of xray film at the size you want  this will basically  give you negative  of the negative  which would  be pretty  cool in of itself's 

Step two : after lay the developed  flim on directly of a another  blank  x-ray flim click the light on for a second  on the englarger

"I had a conversation with a homeless man who asked me for money, I asked him why he needed it, the reply; for food. 

So I ask the man what he likes to eat, he says a Tim's chicken sandwich, sure whatever. I go buy him some food and bring it to him, only for the man to get upset that I didn't get onions (?) And proceeded to throw the sandwich on the ground. First and last time I try to help..... obviously he wasn't hungry, and was going to use the money for something else. 
(The best part, I got 'Spotted in Sudbury' for helping this man) 

My brother is homeless, for the past 7 years and never accepts help from anybody (other than money, which I know he uses for drugs.) Himself, and the people he hangs out with are all very similar in personalities; they're very greedy, self entitled, and want everything without raising a finger, almost like they see themselves as royalty. 

My spouse works with homeless people (that's her job) and she expressed the same thing as I have stated (self  entitlement and greed ) , and the worst part is the always fight back on getting the help that they need. 

There are resources available in the city (albeit not many) but like you said, there's no helping the unwilling.

"Easier at a light controlled intersection? No. It is quite dangerous, actually. In fact, when it comes to emergency vehicle operations, driving lights and siren is by far the most hazardous aspect of the job.  

People at a red light have a difficult time staying put upon the approach of the wee-woos. Seriously folks, don't try to ""pull over"" from your stopped position only to end up blocking the formerly open lane resulting in all lanes being occupied or taking up two yourself. In short, if you are stopped, stay stopped. That way the driver can plan a way around you rather than figure out several scenarios to avoid using opposing traffic lanes.

"Canada is the 51st US state, didn't you know?

On a serious note, given how much people consume of US culture (tv, film, books, music, magazines), is it any surprise that we think that US culture and systems are representative of our own?

Think about it....when was the last time you consumed English-language media of any kind that was by Canadians, for Canadians, and representative of Canadian values, morals, and culture? I intentionally say ""English language"" because francophone content, both Ontario and Québec made, are by, for, and representative of Canada's franco communities.

Anglo Canadians, by and large (and some quasi-exclusively) watch US news, US talkshows, US movies, US tv, and so on and so forth. Just because a Canadian was on the production team, or originated from Canada, or the content was produced in Canada, it doesn't make it Canadian in the sense that it represents us as a country, a people. It remains that the main target is the US population, therefore the content will be such as to satisfy that market.

These are points that I have brought up previously in editorials that have been published in a variety of media organizations.

This train should be extended to Thunder Bay. VIA refuses to engage in any sort of public dialogue though about the topic.

>For a company so concerned with the needs of the market, it’s astonishing how VIA has been unable or unwilling to make any improvements to its existing services in the North.  
How else does one rationalize bypassing Thunder Bay, the largest city in Northwestern Ontario, or stopping just short of a national park — Pukaskwa — and the largest fresh water lake in the world — Lake Superior?""

"Best burger is Oscar's Grill. They grind their meat in house (only place in Sudbury) which means they can control how well done your burger is. Get a medium rare burger there, its life changing. 

Ripe also makes a really good burger. They use potato buns, which I think is the only place around here that does. Its very very good. 

I don't get all the hype for townhouse burgers, they aren't that good. I think it comes from people who have never had a really good burger before, or are used to chain restaurant burgers. Every time I've got a burger there, its overcooked.  HOWEVER you can get one at 1am wasted off your ass, which is nice. 

Aisle 9 made a really good burger when they were in Chelmsford, but I haven't tried them recently at the new location.

Leslie's is decent. But much like the Super cheese and bacon from Deluxe, I think there's a little bit of nostalgia with the burger that makes it better than it actually is. 

I'm overly passionate about burgers and search out the best  burger when I go to a new city.  Oscar's is by far the best in Sudbury as you can get a med rare or medium burger, decent fries/salad portion with it, and its consistently good at a fair price.",t2_ao47d,HonestEd,0,1648679003.0,0,t1_i2rv70b,i2rv70b,True,phat_nutz,t3_tsehxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sudbury/comments/tsehxx/best_burger_in_town/,Best burger in town,/r/Sudbury/comments/tsehxx/best_burger_in_town/i2rv70b/,17,r/Sudbury,0,17

"Respectfully, it isn't my idea. That is how far Lockerby has always extended in that area. It has grown out of fashion to call it the Lockerby area, but basically, the entirety of the South End is Lockerby. 

The tracks have always been the divider for Lockerby. These days though, people tend to use the more regional names like Lo-Ellen, Moonglo, Rumball, Walford Rd, Hospital area (which included the 3 hospitals). The closest you would be to one of these areas is Kelly Lake or Robinson, but it is weird to say you live in those areas because you don't.

"You guys are all compliant to anything the government tells you, even if it makes no sense at all. There is a much bigger picture...and the NON-EXISTENT Covid-19 ""Virus"" was only a very small part of what is actually going on...and where this is all headed.  


Social Credit Score System....and UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME...where everyone...and I mean EVERYONE...gets the same amount of money every two weeks (no matter who you are....doctor, retail worker, etc)...with NO CHANCES of raises...and not only that...but the World Central Bank will dictate to you HOW to spend your money, etc.  


As Klaus Schwab of the World Economic Forum has stated many times over: ""You will own NOTHING...and you'll be happy!""  


THAT, MY FRIENDS...IS THE GREAT RESET THAT THEY WANT... and even that Criminal Justin Trudeau has talked about it.  


And don't forget that ""Internment Camps"" have been built all around the country. These are modern-day ""Concentration Camps"" where they want to send all those who reject the New World Order.

In essence, dear people who are too brainwashed by the media and government to know what is really going on.....THIS IS A WAR ....CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY on a massive scale...because the entire world is being put through all these stupid and illegal measures and restrictions...and you are all too blind to see what the real END GAME is....enslavement of those who will survive the Genocide (Experimental jabs...not ""Vaccines"" for those who fell for it and got injected).

"How in the world will this reduce travel time from the Valley? From 20 minutes to 19 minutes?

The only bottleneck on MR80 was the intersection at Lasalle, which the Maley extension and expanded intersection projects eliminated. The only times I’ve experienced any delays driving from the Valley over the past 2 years is when there has been an accident, which hardly supports spending $100,000,000 on more fucking roads that this inept city could never properly maintain. Most days traffic is flowing at a smooth 130km/h on the Frenchman’s 500. 

I just drove down the stretch of Barrydowne that Interpaving refurbished as recently as last year - broken water main with a vacuum excavator ripping up a section of road.

"I'll take a stab at this...

First of all, power hungry?  He's a politician.  Of course he's power hungry.  They ALL are.  He cooperated with another party, Conservatives combine parties to create bigger parties, they say one thing, do another, show off what makes them look good, hide what doesn't, etc.  Cooperating with parties isn't bad, it's how government runs.

Second, most people don't love Trudeau, he has a few big scamdals already, it took this party agreement to get major plans done, but Canada has traditionally stuck with one party until they get fed up or that party screws up badly enough and go the other way.

Unfortunately, they're looking the other way and seeing a bunch of used car salesmen using American soundbyte tactics, shaking hands with idiot protesters, getting in bed with super dangerous groups, and offering nothing other than ""LIBS ARE DESTROYING DEMOCRACY!!""  Not to mention their Provincial counterparts are doing no favours - ""Buck-a-Beer?""  Chopping plate stickers at a billion dollar loss?  These are good ideas?!  JASON KENNEY AND ANYTHING?!  Compare Bill C124 to finally getting some real defence spending and helping poor kids get dental, and I have no problem with Trudeau until 2025.  So far...

It's the devil you know vs. the devil you don't, but the devil you don't know is standing there in a pile of bullshit, 4 pounds of pomade in his hair, a disingenuous smile, and a ""petition"" he wants you to sign that can't do anything but collect emails to beg for donations to run for Prime Minister when he's not yet party leader, that's not how Canadian elections work, he knows that, and hopes you don't.

Healthcare compensation can be really misleading. I don't know how MoH compensation works but most doctors are incorporated and the only numbers that appear on this list are their salaries for a specific role which can't be included in their corporateearnings. The chiefs of various staffs on the list are making far more than what is listed however the money billed by their corporation to OHIP is not included in that number.
