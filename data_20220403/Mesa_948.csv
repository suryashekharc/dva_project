"* Best view of the Valley is South Mountain. Look up Dobbins Lookout and it'll navigate you there. Drive right up to the top. The entire mountain is technically a state park and is covered in trails, so hike all you want. Remember to always carry water.
* Check out Goldfield Ghost Town. It's a touristy old western town right at the base of the Superstition Mountain.
* Go to downtown Gilbert, lots to eat/drink, great nightlife. My personal favorite is go to Topo's, it's a tiny building/stand right next to a BBQ place. Try the Prickly Pear Ice cream! It's super good! And get it with the lime dip, you wont regret it. I personally love when they dip half in lime and half in chocolate. They also serve amazing burritos using the meat from the BBQ place.
* Look up Wave Cave. It a nice hike on the Superstition that is very Instagramable. It went from obscure to popular with the advent of social media.
* Check out Tempe Town Lake. We have the electric ride-share scooters everywhere and it's a lot of fun to zip around the lake!
* If you're near downtown Tempe then hike ""A"" Mountain, or sometimes referred to as Hayden Butte. It's a short but very steep hike. Paved road to almost the top. It's popular in the evening.
* We have a big aquarium, a Medieval Times, the Musical Instrument Museum (MIM) and a few other museums. Downtown Scottsdale is very artsy and lively. 
* A trip up to Sedona might be worth it.

"Fun! You’ll be flying into East Mesa, close to Gilbert, and Mesa and Gilbert are primarily bedroom communities with plenty of food and activities. 

Joe’s Farm Grill is local and is good quality. Around the corner from Joe’s is Backyard Taco, which is also local and is pretty good.

If you go to downtown Gilbert, you’ll find plenty of mid-tier restaurant chains, and they’re pretty decent. If you go into downtown Mesa, you’ll find local restaurants, especially breweries, and to me, Worth Takeaway is really good. 

Keep heading East on Main Street and you’ll reach Dobson Road and the Asian district. If you like Asian food, that’s the place to be on the East side of the Valley.

If you’re looking for museums, Mesa has some, but you probably want to go to downtown Phoenix to the Phoenix Art Museum to start and various cultural centers. The good news is from the Mesa airport to downtown Phoenix is about 45 minutes. It’s pretty easy to travel quickly most of the time around the Phoenix metro area.

I’m mid-40s and am a native of Mesa and Gilbert. If you questions about the East Valley, I’ll try to answer them the best I can.

Only if you don't drink and drive. The city of mesa and the state of arizona have weaponized their laws against a disease called alcoholism with the intention of ruining the lives of young people and bleeding them out financially to fund their underhanded police department and court system employing underhanded tactics to get plea deals on cases that should be thrown out based on insufficient evidence and or technical issues relating to officers handling of the case. I know of a particular case where prosecuters lied to obtain a plea that has extreme consequences but should have been thrown out of court due to witness issues(the lie) and officer issues(not following documentation requirements).

"We're desperate for health care workers!!

As others have noted - Mesa is huge and will have lots of options for housing. The surrounding areas area great too - Chandler, Gilbert, even Queen Creek/San Tan Valley as some others have mentioned. 

Definitely a conservative state, but that is rapidly changing and I don't think you'll have any trouble finding lots of people with similar interests to yourself, as crunchy or as liberal as you'd like to get! 

I am originally from Colorado, and having an out-doors scene was a must when I moved down here. 12 years later and I am still in awe of the adventures Arizona can offer up. All types of terrains, all ranges of difficulty, any activity you can think of you can do somewhere in the state. I am a big mountain biker/trail runner now, and used to canyoneer and rock climb all the time in my college days - AZ has never ran out of new things for me to do. 

As for Coffee and Restaurants... you're in for a treat coming from just about anywhere, especially anywhere on the east coast (with maybe the exception being NY) to AZ. Our food scene is incredible here, to the point where we are so spoiled and people will begin to refer to it as ""a pretty good food scene"" - no, it's fantastic honestly. And gets better every week. And every city has different food and coffee options that you end up going to explore all the cities instead of just staying wherever it is you choose to live. 

The best part is everything here is so accessible - the furthest you'll drive (without traffic) is 30 minutes to get anywhere. 90% of your driving will be 15 minutes or less - unless you choose to live in San Tan or Queen Creek because those are a little further from the main attractions. 

Anyway long answer short - Yes! Come visit and try the food and coffee scenes out, I'd be happy to recommend some hikes for you to do that will have you swooning for desert landscapes.

"Funny, I've lived in Mesa since 2008 and would rather like to move to Charlotte, NC.

Mesa has several very distinct areas with different ""feels"" to them. Mesa is in fact a huge city by itself, both geographically and population-wise. Mostly it's a bedroom community to Scottsdale and Phoenix, but there are plenty of opportunities to get with like-minded people locally. If you're looking for a more liberal atmosphere, Tempe is another city (right next door) that you might consider; however, housing costs in Tempe are often a bit higher. 

Politically Phoenix (and Arizona) are mixed. There's certainly a bit of a divide, as in most of the country right now. There is a huge need for health-care workers. 

There are TONS of opportunities for outdoor recreation in and around Mesa; if you expand to within a couple hours' drive, possibilities are truly vast. Just understand that the Phoenix area is hot in the summer. No, really, it's very, very hot. Our best outdoor recreation months are November to April. 

There are myriad excellent options for coffee and dining in the Mesa and Phoenix metro areas. 

Definitely remember that Mesa is quite large. Going from, say, the NW corner of Mesa to, say, Williams Field airport in SW Mesa can be a half-hour drive just on its own without leaving Mesa.

Seems like the hiking paths on weekends or most weekend activities in general are now at home because of long queues or parking issues. It is a shame to think us moving was part of what the cities have become, if it wasn't for disc golf we would probably move away now. But even those parks are becoming a hassle to play at. Hopefully PHX doesn't outgrow itself and become the next L.A... also why do we not put solar panels over the cannels like many eastern countries? The panels would be cooled by the water and prevent additional evaporation.

But there are a lot of unknowns in there. How long was the “day” for each part of the creation. Some say 1000 of our years, but that’s based off something else totally unrelated. We have no idea how long Adam an eve were in the garden while the rest of the world existed, we have no idea what the matter our world looked like before it was reused for our mortal existence. 

Time as we know it is a made up human concept. We live in a state where we have a beginning and an end, God lives where there is no beginning and no end, and all is available to him as if it is now.

"That would probably be a very person by person basis, but the Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints are tied to a lot of tech and science. Things like TVs, Heart transplants, Digital audio, modern firearms, etc. were all invented by Mormons. Even my grandpa was a pretty famous scientist in the area of genetics and worked on several teams that used genetics to control insect populations that stopped possible famines in several countries (he worked for the US government, but spent time in China, Russia, and Brazil). My wife's uncle was a lead designer for Apple's new CPU.  

We also believe in worlds populated in other galaxies, so we know there is life on other planets. If we'll ever get to the point before the second coming that we'll be able to travel between the stars is another question. 

The tech that is used for things like genealogy is pretty intense too. 

Searching for ""famous Baptist inventors"" doesn't bring up much in the way of results, but that probably has more to do with the fact that I don't think being a Baptist, or Lutheran, or Catholic is as noteworthy to other Christians is as one LDS person being famous to another LDS person.

"One thing that's tough is I've noticed there are a lot of jobs available, but the majority of them are offering under $18/hr for a job that should probably be paying $50-60K+ with full benefits. 

I just got an email from a recruiter for contract position with one of the largest insurance providers in the world offering $15-18 as an underwriter. Based on the job description it should easily be a full-time, $65K+ salaried position with benefits. 

There are a lot of jobs, but not many that are offering a fair wage. How do you expect to hire quality employees in a corporate environment for the same exact wage a place like Target is offering to stock shelves?

[Here's an article about this issue.](https://www.boredpanda.com/man-applied-60-jobs-got-one-interview-experiment-joey-holz/?utm_source=ecosia&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=organic)There have been huge swathes of fake job postings, or real listings with dishonest pay/positions in the listing. The reason for this is that the labor ""shortage"" has made employers realize they can get away with running a crappy business and blame it on the ""shortage"". Think of every underpaid, understaffed job you've ever worked and then multiply that a few times: that's what's going on. It saves them a ton of money on wages, and with big companies all coordinatedly raising costs on essentials due to ""inflation"" they're making insane profits. 

The reason they still post job openings, however, is that they will get in trouble for understaffing intentionally. So they put out their big ""HIRING NOW!!!"" signs and throw up a few listings on Indeed, then ignore most the responses. Then if they actually interview they are overly picky.

"Ive been pleasantly surprised that mesa has made moves to be more lgbt friendly in the public schools (my mom teaches there) and even some things with the city. That beibg said I don’t currently live there. I would recommend avoiding Gilbert (very mormon and conservative) but neighborhoods etc vary so it would probably still be ok. But i went to Gilbert schools back in the day and am gay and would not recommend. Maybe its better?

Chandler just had their first pride day so they are trying as well. And its more diverse than Gilbert and a nice city if your ok with mostly suburbs.

Tempe is great. Ala charter schools are very conservative and mormon so not the best for lgbt folks. Thats about all i know for specific elementary schools.

Other variables is what activities will you child(ren) be doing?  I.e. sports,  academics, clubs etc. That plays a role.  We felt that Mountain View was the best combination for us and our Son.

The fit/finish is amazing, and you can tell extra car was taken compared to other custom houses, when the home builder was doing it for his own family.

"I know it seemed crazy too me!! When we first started thinking about it, I was under the assumption that if we spent even close to 700k we would be living large out in east mark! Even at +950k we are making sacrifices on living space, garage space, outdoor space, and forgoing most high end finishes. The house is nice no doubt but I wouldn’t look at it and think “million dollar home” especially for the area. 

We are thinking waterston Gilbert which puts us closer to the 1.1-1.3 million mark but the houses are definitely high end with everything you would need so I’m leaning more towards that being the better investment.

"I love the cows! I grew up around Sossaman and Guadalupe and have stayed within ~10 miles of there since I was a kid and it was the end of the valley. However, they're on the way out. They're moving to Chandler and have already demolished most of the farms. You can drive by if you take Elliot from Ellsworth to Power or Warner from Ellsworth to Sossaman. So, i guess if you really don't want the smell, just wait it out a bit. Then again, I heard that land will become more commercial buildings, so to me that's worse. 

Another thing to consider is that with all of this growth you'll get a much busier airport at Williams Field eventually. Likely a lot more cargo flights in the years to come, as well as additional commercial airlines coming in. 

For schools, I grew up in the Gilbert school district, and that *was* one of the best districts in the valley. Eastmark I think is Queen Creek schools, and didn't used to have a very good rep. Obviously that can change with growth, as well. 

Do they have city emergency services out there now, too? Or is there still a fee to pay? And I've heard horror stories related to taxes in Eastmark. The area is being developed using bonds iirc. 

If you're not set on a new build, go a little north. Check out Villages of Eastridge and Augusta Ranch (Baseline <-> Guadalupe / Ellsworth <-> Crismon.

This cop wanted to shoot me so bad. He pulled me over on a traffic violation while out on a bike ride. My concealed weapon was exposed on my right side when he pulled me over and flipped put because I grabbed my wallet out of my left pocket using my left hand. This cop threatened to shoot me if I didn't put my hands on top of my head.

He apologized after the fact and said that I reached for something and that warranted his response. I almost got smoke checked because this confused my left hand for my right.

"Not sure why this comment got down voted because it's accurate. We affectionately call this the ""ghetto 'copter"" and it does fly low with a spotlight in this area a lot. I used to see it a lot more around Baseline and Extension a couple of years ago but not as much recently that tho we do still get it. 

This area around where the 87 and the 60 connect (and farther north at the 202) tend to have a lot of activity which is pretty par for the course anywhere you have a couple of interstates connecting. Plus, economy mostly moved out after the 90s so that's why it's rougher a bit. It's def not a terrible spot but crime rate is kind of bad.

Agree with OP that it's super annoying and honestly unsettling when they shine the light in your windows. I've had it on me when I stepped out on my porch. They're looking for ppl on the run hence, shining it on porches and yard areas (and on ppl). It's a big light so it feels like they're shining it right into your windows.

Unfortunately, your area is rife with stolen vehicles and burglaries, so they may be up over your neighborhood more often than mine, though I occasionally have to deal with them as well.

"I just moved from California.... The prices here are half of what I'm used to in shitty CA!, there you get a crappy 2 bedroom for $2,600 starting December of last year (it was the last straw.. 30% rent increase). There at $25/hr you gotta get on food stamps just to not starve... It's worse in SF...

If you have a job making 19 here it's a survival wage... I made 18 when I was 18 off an ad on Craigslist as a warehouse manager and I had no experience but was a smooth talker...so just don't settle for under 25/hr and you'll be fine.

Minimum wages are for kids. If you're an adult you need to at least aim for double to be comfy. If you can't find any.... Go on YouTube and learn some skills. Plumbing, mechanical and welding professions don't require school or training, just do it.

It's how I've survived all my life and I'm 35. Now I invest in crypto and opened a few online stores and soon I'll reopen for edible deserts delivered in surprise. (Divine & Demonic Distillates: Deserts) 

Wages never follow the living or rent costs, cuz corps are greedier than the people... N we can't keep up with them blocking rent control laws every year... So you need to be unconventional.

I was here just last year and some houses rent went up 60% in just 1 year! 

Good luck!

"I mean if we're going to be really honest it's almost impossible to live on your own unless you're making 45k+/yearly. I tried the whole Craigslist roommate thing and wouldn't recommend it.

You're probably better off moving to NM or NV, which are shadows of what AZ used to be 20 years ago (in terms of cost of living>>gentrification). It's substantially more affordable to live, but also consider labor market availability and payscales. Might not be a bad idea to attend trade school in another state. Depending on the industry and licensing, you may find it to be a less stressful experience money-wise.

"Honestly there are really great parts of Mesa, but anywhere near most appt complexes are riddled with crime. Broadway is nightmarish. Two miles south in the burbs it's fairly nice. I would suggest looking at buying a home if that's possible for you or renting one near the Dobson ranch area. Ahwatuke is very nice and very safe, but prices are a smidge high there.

If you're looking to avoid crime/homelessness you're gonna have a heard time in large parts of phx proper. I would urge you to not move there personally. Tempe has some nice areas west of ASU campus but it can get a bit rowdy. East Mesa and way out south east Mesa are very safe but might be a bit of a commute for you, but it's Mormon land, and the areas are super well taken care of. Scottsdale old town area is really nice, decent apartments and isn't the zany expensive area of schnobsdale.",t2_1e4l166f,noodlesaremydick,0,1642025126.0,0,t1_hsenpjq,hsenpjq,False,SeekAndEnjoy00,t3_s2ashg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mesaaz/comments/s2ashg/apartment_hunting_in_mesa/,Apartment hunting in Mesa,/r/mesaaz/comments/s2ashg/apartment_hunting_in_mesa/hsenpjq/,4,r/mesaaz,0,4
"Don't have specific properties. IMO it is worth trying condos and townhouses for rent. I think the worst rent increases came from from larger companies that own multiple apartment complexes and see things as max-profit. 

 If you're worried about ASU students; they're here but they're not as concentrated and chose Mesa for practical/affordability reasons, so it isn't a party area or anything like that.

Edit: I'd say a lot of crime here isn't random or openly happening, asides from trends that go nationwide and citywide anyway like car part theft, porch pirating, etc . For example, if you're worried about drug addicts, don't buy drugs; you won't have contact otherwise. Homeless keep to themselves asides from begging at lights.",t2_14d1gu,GNB_Mec,0,1642018067.0,0,t1_hse4lr5,hse4lr5,False,SeekAndEnjoy00,t3_s2ashg,https://www.reddit.com/r/mesaaz/comments/s2ashg/apartment_hunting_in_mesa/,Apartment hunting in Mesa,/r/mesaaz/comments/s2ashg/apartment_hunting_in_mesa/hse4lr5/,2,r/mesaaz,0,2

"Well like you mentioned, that bad reputation. I'm leaving a crime riddled area with an exploding homeless/drug abuse problem, last census was 60k+ in the county I live in alone  (aware that these problems are virtually everywhere) pretty relieving to hear it's changing for the better.

Also wanted to be as close to the mountains and lakes as possible! That's definitely one big reason we were looking into NE Mesa. 

I feel like I'm reading to much crime data/statistics after your response it makes me want to look into west Mesa more, I just wasn't a big fan of the Tempe area, kind of reminded me off parts of my area.

"Since you'll be in Tempe and W Mesa, why not W Mesa? 

W Mesa had a bad reputation but it's been chill over here, things have gotten better. Locals are getting pushed out unfortunately, but that's not your problem. 

Dobson has a ton of Asian restaurants, groceries, and other businesses. Part of it is a Asian Business District, but the trend extends South of the 60 as well. 

Main  has the light rail. If you can take it to work, I recommend it.  Also, downtown Mesa has improved, kind of reminds me of what Tempe's downtown used to be like in a sense.

"I know, I know...people have mentioned cost of living, but I don't think they've quite captured the extent. 

The property price bubble that the rest of the country is slowly recovering from is not even slowing in Mesa (and really all of Metro Phoenix).

I don't have hard percentages, but I have experiences. 2 bed/2 bath, 1200 sq ft condos in my complex are going for what 3000 sq ft houses were going for less than 5 years ago. That isn't an exaggeration, and they're selling FAST. It's insane and I feel really bad for anyone trying to buy. 

The bad part is, it's not limited to home purchase. Rent is keeping pace. Rental prices which used to be sub $1k have increased by nearly 50% in some places. This is way outside the norm for the country and CERTAINLY outpaces inflation. 

There are a ton of reasons for this, and I don't think they're all understood quite yet, but when it comes down to it I think that Phoenix has basically become a victim of its own success.

"I personally think you are wrong, but this is just my opinion. Nature has a way of weeding out the weak. It is unfortunate, but true. Humans are no excuse to that. 

If you think being “the richest country in the world” is meant because we have the most dollar bills, you do not comprehend economics. The United States is one of the richest countries in the world because we own the right to a shit ton of resources and land and produce a shit ton of product from those resources (or just sell the resources/land) than most other countries in the world. Problem now, we are not producing any product because people would rather make TikTok videos and sit on their phones, rather than work. So if you think sticking it to the man by boycotting the Buffalo Spot until they go out of business is going to make anyone lose sleep (besides the owner of the buffalo spot) to the point where they give you a raise, this is showing your misunderstanding to the economy and supply and demand. Another restaurant will pop up in that same location Buffalo Spot failed at, they will pay the same amount of money to their employees, and probably more for their lease, and the owners will have even slimmer margins to stay competitive with their costs to all the other restaurants in the same market. 

Where someone will actually make money, is in an industry that requires specific skills that require time and practice to master. Meaning you have to  work for it. Those trades, whether it be construction, tech, computer programming, etc. are will be what separates you from the rest.

Fortunately/Unfortunately, we (humans) have become intelligent enough to realize our capabilities of avoiding early death, which keeps people alive longer, all while reproducing at a more successful rate than any other organism (besides cancer cells) that I am aware of, and have clearly overpopulated the earth. 

Follow me here…

Because people are worried about working at the buffalo spot, and being content with working a cash register or cooking food, instead of learning how to build homes, engineer/design electrical systems or Air distribution packages, learn to bolt car engines together, or put a hammer to a nail and actually put the work in place to build homes, we literally can not build homes, cars, or any other product fast enough to make it easier and more sustainable and available to everyone. So unfortunately, the money flows to what is more in demand. 

My opinion summarized: 

Cashiers are not in demand and provide low wages because restaurants are not in demand because they truly are not a necessity, they are a luxury, anyone can cook dinner at home. Construction workers and materials are in demand because homes are in demand and not everyone knows how, or is willing to build a home.

Skilled tradesman will make more money because it is hard to find people good at their job and know what they are doing and keep up with the demand. They will make more money than the cashier, meaning they will be able to out bid the cashier for that last available home. 

Survival of the fittest. Whether America is rich or not, we are still overpopulated and under-housed. Houses don’t (yet) just magically pop up out of the ground.

"They are offering more than that, so maybe reread it?  And yes, I do believe it's more than fair for someone with limited or no serving/bussing/cooking experience at a restaurant.  Many of us worked these jobs when younger, and had roommates, and went to school.  I don't picture people with families to rely on this, but to disparage a business because of what they're offering is also unfair.  

They're obviously struggling to retain good people, that accepted a level of work for an above average wage (compared to current offerings).  By offering higher wages or whatever they have to to retain employees, then they pass that on to you, and me, who then have to pay more to go out, or opt not to.
