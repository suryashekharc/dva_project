"Working with computers <> Networking <> Cyber Security

Before making a decision, figure out what you like about the field of computers. Saying ""I like working with computers"" is as meaningful as saying ""I like working with tools"". 

For example, I like working with my customers on strategic decisions when it comes to IT much more than the hands on aspect of it. For me, working in a datacenter as a Cyber Security Analyst would be death to my soul.

You need to really figure out what aspects you like of ""working with computers"" and focus on that. It could be Cyber Security, it could be Networking, it could be something else. Or, you could be like me and enjoy consulting. It's a wide field.

"I like Shawarma Master on Eagleson. They've always had fresh ingredients since they opened, and everything tastes great!

Other restaurants;

\- Kanata Noodle House on Terry Fox (Thai/Viet) Been around forever, and amazing. I recommend their Pho. Best I've had in the city.

\- Simbad Bakery on Hazeldean (Lebanese meat/cheese pies) Everything baked and made in-house. Very good and very cheap

\- Cal's Place on Hazeldean (All day breakfast, good pub food. Great pizza) Great little spot with good food. All day breakfast means you can have a beer with your breakfast. Highly recommend. I've heard good things about the pizza from many, but have yet to try.

\- Lorenzo's Pizza on Castlefrank. Good pizza joint, very friendly people that work there. Great in-house made garlic sauce.

\- Tommy's Dining Lounge on Hearst Way (All kinds of food, pizza is great). I only ever order pizza from here. It's a hidden gem. Seriously some of the best pizza in town.

\- Dragon Fortune Delight on Stonehaven (Chinese) Standard americanized-chinese food. Very good, been around for almost 20 years now. I don't think there's anything I've tried that I haven't liked.

So many things are wrong with this statement.
Firstly you know that this isn't true so it's kind of gross that youre making this arguement. Nearly everything in our media presents exclusively a heterosexual, cisgender narrative. So arguing that a flag and a couple posters makes it seem like being lgbtq+ is the only option is absolutely ridiculous and flat out wrong.

"**[Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)** 
 
 >Godwin's law, short for Godwin's law (or rule) of Nazi analogies, is an Internet adage asserting that as an online discussion grows longer (regardless of topic or scope), the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Adolf Hitler approaches 1. In less mathematical terms, the longer the discussion, the more likely a Nazi comparison becomes, and with long enough discussions, it is a certainty. Promulgated by the American attorney and author Mike Godwin in 1990, Godwin's law originally referred specifically to Usenet newsgroup discussions. He stated that he introduced Godwin's law in 1990 as an experiment in memetics.

"Yes, I am indeed using ""Alphabet soup"" in a very derogatory way, because it conveys my contempt for the tactic of shoehorning a diverse spectrum of people under one banner who may not necessarily appreciate it, for the sake of activist convenience.

Speaking of which, I fully also intended ""Alphabet soup"" in a very derogatory way as a dig at the activists who would claim to speak on behalf of the component groups that make up the LGBTQ alphabet soup.

I am teaching my kids to be free thinkers, and not to automatically snap a salute at every activist teacher or school official who crosses their path. I have often told them that there is nothing wrong with being gay and transgender, but that no activist teacher or school official has the right to manipulate them into thinking they're gay or transgender. I'm teaching them to think for themselves, rather than being slaves to whatever is fashionable.

If you think that's some sort of bigoted fever dream, then think again, as it has already happened at another OCDSB grade school:

"That's not an accurate comparison.

For one thing, the ""Christmas"" content at my kids' school strips all mentions of Jesus and Christianity from any discussions, and the so-called ""decorations"" are of the reindeers and candy canes variety.

But even if you assume the secular shopping season we now refer to as ""Christmas"" has any tangible relationship to Christianity, the school in question at least also gives equal airtime to Jewish and Muslim holiday seasons. My kids are well-versed on the actual meanings of Hanukkah and Ramadan courtesy of what they've learned at school, which in and of itself is a good thing. On the other hand, they've learned absolutely nothing about Christianity from their teachers, despite being marinated in secular Ho-ho-ho at this of year.

If you want a more accurate comparison, try to think of what an unsuspecting visitor to the school would assume if the rainbow flag and LGBTQ posters were replaced by the iconography of any one religion, be it a cross, a Star of David, a crescent moon, or any other well-known religion. The unsuspecting visitor would assume the school is specifically for members of the religion represented by said iconography.

"You are allowed to eat in your own home, you’re allowed to buy takeout. Nobody is depriving you from a human right by denying you access to a dine-in restaurant over your own selfish platitudes. The difference between a racial minority and you is that you are given a choice. Multiple choices. You can decide anytime to stop being an idiot, and you won’t be punished for it. You’ll be welcomed into society like everybody else. 

If you felt the urge to carry a handgun on you at all times in order to feel safe, would you feel the same way? That it’s everybody else’s duty to adapt to your insecurities, rather than the majority taking the obvious preventative measures to avoid maximal bodily damage? 

It’s the same thing. At any time, you would have the option to put your pride aside and be allowed into the restaurant. In fact, if you tried to go to a restaurant with a handgun in Canada, you’d be arrested. You won’t be arrested for trying to go to a restaurant without a vaccine, you’d simply be asked to leave. 

So why shouldn’t we put idiots who take the law into their own hands into prison? If they cannot abide by our democratically established rights and freedoms, they can go elsewhere or pay the price. As long as you are a member of a democratic society, your decisions will matter in the face of the law. Decide you don’t want a license to drive? You’ll go to jail. Decide you want to dodge income taxes? Jail. The government HAS been putting tariffs, limitations and impositions on your life since you were BORN. 

This isn’t new. Crazy that it took something mutually beneficial for the entire population for you to realize that you are at the mercy of the government of the country in which you live. That’s what organized government is. Your voice is incorrect and even more insignificant.

If we do not have equal access despite having equal wealth one of us is not equal is likely having something they don't want imposed on them via coercive means.

Yeah sure... *""you're not allowed to eat inside a restaurant""* isn't a very serious threat....but essentially the right to freely trade and travel has been revoked if you are unvaccinated at this point...and it doesn't appear to be be going away any time soon...

"Hey these are valid questions.

Amazon is great, eBay is awesome, and Google is your friend. Seriously. Any questions you have, mister Google has the answers. 

However,

If you’re worried about transmission. 

What about letters this year? With some baked goods, maybe you could try your hand at cookies? 

Sanitize the bags of the ingredients, or even make it easy and buy a pre-made cookie mix! Make sure you read the back to see if the directions have any additional ingredients, like eggs or butter. 

Shopping unfortunately raises transmission risk. The products aren’t ever usually cleaned and they’re handled by lots of people who don’t wash their hands. 

So, let’s get creative! I’d love to help you come up with more ideas if I can.

Thank you for being so considerate. I know it’s really really really really hard existing like this. And, look at you. What a kind human you are, still wanting to gift your loved ones.

Don’t let mean people get at you. I can understand maybe your life experience is not close to a ““typical” one. Which is awesome. Mine isn’t either, I have to be careful too :)

"You're not understanding me. Look at the OP's post: ""We all did get vaccinated and still the same. Everyone should be vaccinated by now.""

They're expecting that since the vaccination rate (for eligible people) is currently 85% in Ottawa, which is a fairly good rate, we should be seeing COVID dwindle, yet the R(t) estimate is still hovering at about 1. Why is that?

It's because ""we all"" have **not** been vaccinated, namely children have not. When you include them, the vaccination rate in Ottawa is only 74%, which leaves a lot more room for a highly contagious virus like COVID to spread, especially when you congregate those unvaccinated people in schools.",t2_shw7,a-priori,0,1634137375.0,0,t1_hgho7uw,hgho7uw,False,1990soldtimes,t3_q62spm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanata/comments/q62spm/is_covid_19_going_to_be_stale_and_never_ends/,Is covid 19 going to be stale and never ends?,/r/Kanata/comments/q62spm/is_covid_19_going_to_be_stale_and_never_ends/hgho7uw/,2,r/Kanata,0,2
What I'm saying is the data for vaccination rate accounts for this age discrimination. Whenever the vaccine becomes eligible for those under 12 and under the data will be adjusted accordingly. How do you think the kids can get the virus? Because of unvaccinated or partially vaccinated adults that have caused the mutations like Delta. Also children do need to be in school In some capacity especially those with special needs (speaking from experience). You have to put Faith in the medical experts and how they are dealing with this dynamic situation of COVID.

"Was raised here in Kanata. Moved a few other places around Ottawa for a few years when I was younger, but ended up buying a house and settling down back here in Kanata.

 It's a pretty awesome place to live. Safe, quiet, lots of amenities and close enough to downtown Ottawa if you should feel the need to head there. Lots of outdoor activities here, especially for trails (biking included). In fact, the old original Kanata neighborhoods were designed with the ""garden city"" concept in mind, so incorporate lots of trees, trails, parks, and natural spaces, though the newer neighborhoods that have been built after amalgamation with Ottawa aren't so lucky it seems. We also have a healthy amount of city-owned public spaces/buildings including the Kanata Rec Center in south Kanata, and the newer and larger Richcraft Rec Center in North Kanata, as well as tennis courts, hockey arenas, basketball courts etc. scattered throughout.

We're also home to the Canadian Tire Center, so if Hockey is your thing, that's where The Ottawa Senators play. Any huge-name concerts are also put on there, so you won't have far to get home. We have a massive 24 screen movie theatre here, as well as Tanger Outlets which is a fairly large outlet mall with all kinds of popular brands, especially for clothing.

Kanata itself has lots of great little independent restaurants, with and cafes hidden all over, as well as regular chain style fast food, so options are plentiful on the food front, and they include food of all kinds of different ethnicities. Lots of great options of pubs and bars as well, though if you like dancing I'm not aware of any ""club"" type spots around here. People generally go downtown for that. 

There really isn't much serious crime here, mostly petty stuff like vandalism, or kids rummaging through people's cars that are unlocked. A month or two ago, we had a drive by shooting in my parents neighborhood which was shocking and I believe a first for out here, but it was definitely the extreme exception, and is not the norm. When I was in my teen years and early 20's, I would walk everywhere, sometimes in the dead of night and never really had issues. Don't think that's really changed either.

"I have heard quite a bit that Kanata North has geology that leads to greater risk of elevated radon levels in homes. There unfortunately aren’t any freely available radon maps that go into so much to know if a specific neighbourhood is at higher risk for radon. But heads up that a school near your area (Jack Donohue) was closed for a bit in 2017 due to elevated radon levels in some classrooms. https://ottawacitizen.com/news/local-news/students-return-to-kanata-school-after-radon-concern

But no matter where you live, it’s still recommended that every household test for radon. Radon levels can really vary a lot from house to house, so there’s no way of knowing whether it’s a concern for you unless you test. Even in “low radon” areas there’s still a risk of individual houses having elevated radon, and not all houses in “high radon” areas will have high radon levels. Details on how to test and where to purchase the kits can be found at: https://takeactiononradon.ca/

"So as I asked before, who do you recommend? I’m not trying to pick a fight, I am legitimately asking. And I’m trying to make sure we are all honest with ourselves and each other. I’m a fiscal conservative and firmly believe in government acting more financially responsible. I do not support most liberal or socialism positions.

At the same time I am not impressed by any of the current candidates in any of the parties at Provincial or Federal levels so I continue to vote with my wallet. 
I don’t blame the Conservative party for our current pandemic situation if that is your chief complaint. Every province is struggling, as are most countries in the world who do not have domestic vaccine manufacturing capabilities. Even then countries like India are struggling. I have three children in the public school system and I am quite happy with what they are learning and how it is being done. I have suffered a significant medical event and the care I received was exemplary. My mother was in long term care and was treated very well.

Vaccines to hotspots. Close non-essential business. Finally give folks 14 paid sick days.

"Even in the primitive village (all) these measures would neither work nor be accepted. Humans cannot be shut away, children must interact (and go to school) with other children, and history has shown that when a population is efficiently, successfully frightened AND divided (BLM, masks, immigration ..etc), it is left vulnerable to even more (nonsensical) government control and a myriad of deadly, related social-psychological costs. I have no problem donning the mask, regardless of contradictory scientific view points, but the reflexive, ill-thought out, and extreme measures separating family from family and friends from friends is tantamount to tyrannical oppression. There ARE ways to be responsible and cautious for “however long”, to take sane measures as responsible citizens (and we should) but this? This is disastrously harmful.

"Based on what my realtor has said, we're definitely in a bubble, but we just don't know where in the bubble. So it's not necessarily that the prices will go down, but they won't go for the insane over asking that they currently have been.

I viewed a place off Hunt Club in the south end two days ago. It was alright. Listed for $369. Decent starter place but I passed since I was looking for more. My realtor said it got 25 offers and will probably go for $550k. He's going to let me know later today.
