"Grew up in Port Arthur. Some parts of the city are as bad as people say they are, and some parts of Port Arthur are zoned for other school districts so many people don't even realize it's still Port Arthur.

I have a soft spot for the city, but I don't recommend living there unless you want a low cost of living and an even lower flood plain (as in, wherever in PA you live has the possibility of being flooded during the next Harvey level hurricane). Similar risks in the immediately nearby cities of Groves and Port Neches.

"Generally I think its good to have a college degree.  Besides just being good to be educated, it also helps get in the door at a lot of places.  The tech world is intensely competitive right now due to the salaries and a college degree helps.  That said, what you study and where you study is a whole other conversation.  Years ago I studied at Lamar for a few years before going to a bigger better school.  For the most part, computer science was the same at both places.  Things may have changed a lot since then.  Also its not great to be deep in student loan debt.  Also in college you meet people and make social connections which are often key to career growth.  I have interviewed CS grads from Lamar and they were decent but that is more about the person than about Lamar.  Overall in my experience smart motivated people can go to any college and do well because they are smart and motivated.


Also in college you can study business, psychology, other useful topics.  There are plenty of business roles in tech where you don't have to be a coder, but if you understand the tech you can do well for yourself as a project manager or sales / marketing person or something.  In fact at a lot of companies the software devs are seen as factory workers while business folks are seen as more management types.  Also there are loads of tech jobs that are not faang.  In the Houston area, places like Academy and Home Depot hire devs.  There are also big corps like banks and oil companies and AIG (having a college degree is basically required to get into big corps).  The medical center has a startup incubator building new medical tech.  Walmart is building a big tech organization to compete with Amazon.  Target up in Minnesota has a big  tech organization.  

Maybe there is a way for you to go to college and work in tech to pay for it, to get both college and some work experience and not have student loan debt.  If the help desk job helps provides that, then maybe its a good opportunity.  You'll have to figure that out for yourself.

One last thing, be wary of the huge salary numbers.  In other places on reddit, and especially blind, you'll see these ridiculous numbers like 200k-300k TC for junior folks.  Yes that happens but that is not really normal.  In Houston new grads are getting like 85k-90k which is still great money.  A lot of devs make between 100k-200k depending on location after years of experience.  Some people start at 50k-60k doing basic frontend work.  Point is, you can do financially well in this industry but most people don't get spectacular money like faang in the bay area, and there is stiff competition for those jobs.",t2_56iwi,winnie_the_slayer,0,1633013017.0,0,t1_heutdpf,heutdpf,False,Skyvale92,t3_pxzck7,https://www.reddit.com/r/setx/comments/pxzck7/tech_career/,Tech Career,/r/setx/comments/pxzck7/tech_career/heutdpf/,2,r/setx,0,2

"am a software dev and have hired and led many devs.

There are a lot of things you can do in tech.  Presently there are a lot of remote jobs available such that you could stay in setx and make good money, if you want, or travel wherever.

Your biggest challenge is lack of experience.  If you want to be a developer, I'd suggest skip the help desk and go for some kind of dev work.  Pick a stack to focus on.  Do some personal projects, have code on github, have projects online for hiring managers to see.  Front end or back end?  Lots of jobs for reactjs and python right now.  Java is still king at faang.  In Houston, C# seems to be the most common language used.  Each of those is more than a language, you'll need to learn frameworks, tools, etc.  For C# learn visual studio.  For java, intellj and spring boot.  For python learn pycharm and flask.  Learn how to use linux, vim, cron, docker, kubernetes.  All this stuff can be downloaded for free and setup to play with.  Even aws has some level of free.

For dev job:

- go to /r/cscareerquestions and read about people's interview experiences.  
- grind leetcode and hackerrank to get good at solving coding problems.  these will make up the majority of your interviews
- practice interviewing a lot.  learn about behaviorial interviews and [STAR](https://careercenter.lehigh.edu/node/145)
- study system design questions
- get a good book like CTCI ""Cracking the code interview""
- expect to fail a lot.  keep going.  the hiring process in tech is a complete mess full of insanity.  Treat it as a numbers game.  Focus on each step of the process and work on it until you pass it reliably.  Start with resume on linkedin and such.  Keep working on it until you get frequent hits from recruiters.  That should get you to round 1 phone screen.  Practice that until you pass it most of the time.  Then you'll get to onsites and longer interviews.  That will probably be the hardest part.  Practice practice practice.
-  Don't get attached to companies.  people job-hop like crazy in this field.  its normal.  The key bit is to make social connections with people in the field and keep those alive.  They are your key to advancement.

Cloud stuff is popular right now so you can pickup AWS (for example) by reading online.

https://nathanpeck.com/gamers-guide-to-playing-aws/


Another route you could go is devops / SRE.  That involves some amount of coding but not as much as a pure dev.  It is a lot of infrastructure automation using scripts.  Interesting work if you're into it.  Pays as well as devs.

Above all keep your people skills sharp.  There are some nerds in this field sure, but people are people and getting along with your teammates and managers is the most important part of your job.


You can  teach yourself all this stuff faster than they'll teach at Lamar.  You just need some stuff to put on your resume and learn how to play the hiring game.

"I left SETX for partly this reason, but that was almost 20 years ago.  Remote work is fast becoming the norm and I expect that to continue, so the chance of staying put and finding good work is improving, with the best chances being with companies outside of the Golden Triangle who won't care where you live.  Yes, there are IT and related jobs in the area, but they are few and far between (IMO).  I hope one day to be wrong on this.

First piece of advice:  You've mentioned different but potentially related disciplines (Python programmer, Web Development, Help Desk).  What are you most passionate about?  What motivates you?  I suggest creating a vision of what you want to do (even WHERE you want to do it!) and strive toward that goal.  This isn't written in stone and can be changed as you grow and learn more.

Second piece of advise:  Set up profiles on Indeed and Zip Recruiter that reflect this vision and path, listing what you've done, what you are doing, and where you're going.  Set up job alerts with the location as 'Remote' to find those opportunities that lay outside of the Golden Triangle.

"Sorry. If I am a bit confussibg. I have a fairly high I.Q., but also suffer, from have died after having a severe brain injury, that kept me from breaking over 90% of my bones, while being dragged and mangled under a car when I was 5 1/2, being dead for about 10 minutes, being taken to 3 different hospitals in search of miracle doctor's, finally at Texas Children's Hospital for a few months after losing over 26 units of blood and a sustained temperature of 106° degrees f. Should never have been brought back to live, because every instance was a clear indicator that a brains could recover from so much damage, after finally be completely surrounded by ice, to try and stop blood loss of over 6 kids of my size. Being dead for 10 minutes, head was split open, no one survives a 106^f for a prolonged period and recover. I was the youngest, non•green; Frankenstein to survive or live from resources and equipment, being used in the Summer of 1969. If you have a wifi question, look it up on Google, if you have a friend with a smartphone, or if you have a smart phone, access settings, tap connections, then select mobile hotspot and tethering features. Select Hotspot~ that should give you an access name and password you need to use on you laptop to connect the data from your phone. I know a little, about certain things but not know your country or location, or what type of connections that exist in your specific area, to figure it all out, I would suggest not getting high until after you achieve you primary goals; other/and/ or more desired goals, other than frying, and mass murdering 100's of 1,000's of your non-renewable brain cells!? Then you just might find the help you need to succeed in your discovering answers to your pothead's questions. Or use your stash money for wifi; instead. If you ever need a semi-retarded friend to speak on your level. Chat me up anytime. You seem to be very interesting, I with my memory loss, it is very hard to have or keep any friends, to chat. I do confuse story lines very often. Sorry for my confusing statements, at best. Have a safe, healthy, and wisely wealthy, of many attributes.

I am a mess. I never intend to be offending, in any way, shape, form or fashion. Good Luck. I did not understand what ad meant in your reply. Lately here in Houston Texas, things have gotten so bad since the politicians keep relating the support payments to the poor to survive, while waiting for the poorest and oldest or costly disabled persons to die off, to safe more money in the long-run, before enhancing those who may have not been able to purchase gifts for themselves while not having to starve, stay sick, for the die-off stage to finally dwindle as many of the overly needy, to be around to need any more of anything once dead.",t2_7m4ssvah,TryByDemand963,0,1614059336.0,0,t1_gofjyqp,gofjyqp,False,Dick_C_Normus7,t3_lpne49,https://www.reddit.com/r/setx/comments/lpne49/laptop_work/,Laptop work,/r/setx/comments/lpne49/laptop_work/gofjyqp/,1,r/setx,0,1

"Born and raised in the area, moved away a year ago for work. Some of these places may not be open anymore.

My favs were...

**Port Arthur**

Tequila's on Gulfway in Port Arthur was always good, but the Tequila's at Central Mall wasn't.

El Viejo Tony is one of the better Mexican restaurants in the area. Food quality is on par with El Tiempo in Houston, but the atmosphere isn't as high end.

Sombrero on 69 South is similar with a slightly more put together atmosphere.

Pin and Tonic at the bowling alley near Central Mall can be a blast with the right crowd. Great bartenders and great karaoke DJ. There's also a concession area with really delicious boudain balls to go with your beer.

Boss Burger has some artful burger choices and the owner is really cool. Not sure if they still do, but they used to host a Jeep night for the local Jeepers.

**Port Neches**

Neches River Wheelhouse is really good if you're into Cajun food, always enjoyed the stuffed chicken or crawfish grilled cheese. You'll often see tanker ships pass by and toot their horns.

Neches Brewing Company has a lot on tap, filled with locals that have always cared about the area, and usually some live music.

The Feed Store has some solid breakfast. I remember their hours being kind of strange so have a plan B.

**Nederland**

Billy Joe's BBQ has always been there and has always been solid. It's not a fancy BBQ joint that you'd see on a TV show, but it never failed to make my belly happy.

Luke's Icehouse has a lot of good bar food and burgers along with some decent beer choices. The one in Beaumont is bigger but I lived closer to Nederland.

**Beaumont**

Suga's is so freaking good. High end southern cuisine. If you're into collared greens, gumbo, nice drinks, fancy clothes, and some light jazz you'll enjoy an evening there.

J. Wilson's is pretty good, but I remember it being pretty noisy.

Log On Cafe is a pretty chill bar with a laid back karaoke night.

Amelia Farm and Market has some high end brunch, lots of outdoor seating.

Crown Pizza/Willie Burger are a pair of sibling restaurants that feel like they were plucked out Austin or Downtown Houston and dropped into place.

"Hi all, sorry that I'm late to this but I had an account snafu and was temporarily locked out. I've stickied this thread and it will be the Megathread for now for Laura, although specific posts regarding Laura are still very allowed- this will just be for general discussion. If you have any resources you wish to share, please do and I will add them to this post.

Please know that the current path looks pretty damn bad for Southeast Texas, including Beaumont, Port Arthur, Orange, the Golden Triangle, and surrounding areas. There is a **mandatory evacuation** in effect. If you can get out, it is highly recommended you do, and my personal opinion is that you should. This storm is not a flooding issue like Harvey and Imelda, it will have ridiculously intense winds and storm surges, which can pose immediate and imminent dangers to your health and safety, and with the evacuation order there will not be immediately available resources for aid should you encounter a worst case scenario. That being said, if you choose not to leave for whatever reason, do feel free to post about current conditions, your situation, anything like that. My recommendation is to follow official orders, but I absolutely will not allow shaming for anyone that chooses their own decision. Having been through multiple hurricanes, I do know how tough and potentially challenging that call is to make. I just ask you to the best of your abilities stay as safe as possible. 

Highly encourage everyone to share how evacuation traffic is looking, conditions you see around town if you decided to stay, any resources that could help anyone, and any experiences you are having in regards to this storm. During Harvey we all came together to help out and I hope we can again now. Please feel free to send me any resources you want and I can add them to this top of the thread post. Please stay safe out there.

"I'm already gone.  Easy for me to evac.  Just myself, so I packed up and left earlier on Monday afternoon.  The Port Arthur mandatory evac was the decision maker.  I knew other Mid Co cities would follow suit, so I decided to beat the traffic.  

Not worth staying put to me.  If the house gets damaged, it gets damaged.  They're only things and can be replaced.  That said, I'm still up at 1 am watching meteorologist updates.  I need to go to bed.

And the kicker, there's no way I'm risking a week or so in SETX after the storm with no AC.

Edit to add: If you're in a city/county with a mandatory evac, think hard before you ignore it.  What do you gain by staying?  What do you risk losing by staying?

"Depending on the degree of 'help' they need, here are some options:

(1) If the help the Mormon teen needs is... information... (i.e., ""Since this is a private phone call, let me just mention that you may not know that there are certain important things the church isn't telling you. Have you read, ""The CES Letter""?)   https://cesletter.org/CES-Letter.pdf

(2) If the 'help' the teen needs is a connection with other people, he or she can go to https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/ and do a search for the nearest ExMormon support group. 

Of course, the most difficult portion of the situation is that we're talking about a... 'teen'; someone who is a legal minor, living with parents, and not yet 18, the age of 'majority'. With that said, I'd warn to not actually 'help' the teen yourself as it could be misunderstood by others and awake the possibility of legal entanglements. But, if you simply give the teen the information I've mentioned, above, and the teen takes action on their own, that should work well. 

If I've missed the mark or the intention of your question, feel free to clarify and ask me another question. 


(FYI - I spent 43 years as a very active 'True Believing Mormon' [TBM], and once I discovered that massive fraud and deception of the Mormon church I officially resigned my membership and have placed myself in a position to help others in their 'transition' leaving the church, which for many is quite traumatic.)",t2_2bqpdzx2,BeaumontTexAreaExmo,0,1596686659.0,0,t1_g0iw0ll,g0iw0ll,False,BeaumontTexAreaExmo,t3_hxb69a,https://www.reddit.com/r/setx/comments/hxb69a/beaumont_area_exmormon_group_is_growing/,Beaumont Area Ex-Mormon group is growing.

Not a 'family friend who can not confirm.'

And has confirmed multiple people coming in thinking they had it, only to end up with negative test results. After being quarantined for testing.

Whereas, the publicized case is the first confirmed positive in this area. 

So, I apologize if I believe that someone who deals with the actual intricacies involved and doesn't work like a game of telephone over you and your 'family friend.'

You may have been concerned with keeping people safe. However, you posted without confirmed facts. That is highly dangerous in this situation, and whether you like it or not you are fully accountable for your actions. 

Have I been petty? Yes. Because it irks me that you feel you need this validation at the risk of causing panic through not having actual confirmation. And that is exactly how your behavior has come across. Your previous reply is the first instance today that you have owned up to the fact that you were incorrect.

So, hopefully you will realize that people's safety is more important than you getting some twisted recognition from incorrect facts.
Hopefully, you will wait until you have actual evidence in the future.

"**UPDATE:**

The Beaumont-based Burning Man camp, ""Camp Just Ahead,"" is looking to grow this year. We had a small camp of 5 last year, we'd like to double that this year.

If spending your hard-earned money and vacation time driving to a dusty desert 2,000 miles away and camping with 70,000 crazy people in a temporary city full of art sounds like fun to you, let's talk!

We're having our first intro / planning meeting **NEXT** Friday, January 31, at my house in Beaumont. DM me for details. We'll field questions from anyone who hasn't been before, along with starting to think about our travel, possible camp theme / interactivity option, infrastructure, etc.

If you don't know much about Burning Man other than the Simpsons episode, YouTube is a great resource, but read this first to set the scene:

"Not much has changed, I was suspended, always in in-school suspension and ultimately expelled. I was treated terribly and it really hurt my academic future. BISD’s teaching and disciplinary policies are draconian and hurtful to students. 

All of my disciplinary actions were things that I could not control such as tardiness, absences and dress code. I am late or absent because I was reliant on my parents and my clothes didn’t always fit because I was a teenager. Teenagers grow fast and we can’t always tuck in our shirts.

"Left there and have no desire to ever go back. You will get paid way less than market value for office work, but housing might be nice. Its a very small town in a big city type place. Everyone knows everyone, money stays with money, and gossip is king.

Newer restaurants and ideas have been popping up, but the city is very cliqueish to me.

Find out what hobbies you like, and look into locations that help. I'm an avid gamer and struggled to break into good communities... But if country western, dancing, drinking a beer, and being out in the flat lands and dense woods is your bag, there's plenty to go round.

Helping your family is nice , but it will not promote your career.

My advice to get best of both worlds would be to move to the Houston area so you are close enough to work with your family for the weekend, but in a city of such diversity, global reach, and opportunity that your personal life doesn't suffer.

Harvey hit hard, and the people rallied together, it was beautiful to see how the community stepped up.

But even still, I wish my family would leave. Once you live there, its just so dang hard to leave.

"Just read the flyer. Looks good. We might show up. Apologies if I had way too negative of a viewpoint on this. I'd call it something other than critical mass. Any critical mass ride I've been a part of in the past was definitely not a follow the rules kind of ride and i think in general calling a ride a critical mass ride has that public image (for better or worse). That was the kind of thing I thought was being advocated.

"Man....critical mass does not sound like a good idea in Beaumont. I know the purpose and I agree with claiming a lane but I think any critical mass rider should be prepared for serious injury if they attempt it.    

There was a group of folks that would do a social ride at night out of bicycle sports on Wednesday nights a few years ago. Not sure if that is still a thing or not but, just following the laws and belng a visibile/predictable cyclist would probably reach those goals a little more responsibly.  

I used to claim lanes on dowlen and never really had any issues but I used flashers and a high vis helmet. Good luck, have emergency contact info on you and a gopro just in case. 

&#x200B;

"I made a quick trip around parts of Nederland this afternoon.  

The Mobile on the corner of Nederland Ave and Twin City was open with a line of cars to fill up.  The Valero was closed.  The Citgo on Nederland and 14th was open with a line of cars to fill up.

Most restaurants between on Nederland Ave between Twin City and 27th St were open, with the exception of Subway.

Market Basket on 27th st was open with a long line around the corner.  Did not go inside, so I don't know how they're stocked.

And most importantly, Sunshine Liquor is open and well stocked.

I stopped by the Nederland City hall to ask about trash pickup, they said the landfill is not accepting anything with no estimate to when it reopens, so they can't say when trash pickup will continue.  I asked where they will announce when it is, and she told me to sign up for Nixle.  I guess that's a public safety messaging service.  You sign up by texting your zip code to 888777.

Note: This is not to say other places aren't open.  This is just what I saw on my quick trip to get booze.

"Insanely bad news.

>The City of Beaumont lost service on its main pump station because of rising water levels on the Neches River.
The city, which released a statement after midnight Thursday on its website, said it expects to lose water pressure within the next three to four hours after its second water source — located at the Loeb wells in Hardin County — was also lost.

>""At this time there is no water supply for the City water system,"" the statement reads. ""We will have to wait until the water levels from this historical flood recede before we can determine the extent of damage and make any needed repairs. There is no way to determine how long this will take at this time.""
