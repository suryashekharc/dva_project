"It's roughly 9% of the present EU imports from Russia. The ability to actually deliver that much is in question, for reasons having to do with infrastructure on both sides of the Atlantic. An effort like this requires massive developments of longer term investments. The anticipated LNG exports will tap the domestic abilities at present for buildouts of refrigeration, pipelines and other port infrastructure, and new shipping tonnage, but are at least theoretically conceivable. 

Pipeline access will likely cause local energy prices to rise substantially to backfill exported gas production, in part because of grid connectivity and spot price exposure for electrical power to natural gas markets subject to regional export. 

In the 90's, for example, the two pipelines built to export gas form WY and CO caused WY and CO regional gas prices to rise by 25% and 15% over just a couple of years after the commissioning of each pipeline, causing heating and electric rates to rise substantially...far closer to the prices in the midwest states where the gas was newly available for sale. The rapid replacement of heating and industrial demands with natural gas in just 10 years there is amazing, and there are always new efforts to bring yet more gas to the regional network. Natural gas pricing has a large impact on midwest electricity prices.",t2_r0jt9,periboulder,0,1648399697.0,0,t1_i2by2oh,i2by2oh,True,WayneCider,t3_to8xog,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandjunction/comments/to8xog/anyone_have_any_opinions_on_what_kind_of_an/,Anyone have any opinions on what kind of an impact this news will have on the county?,/r/grandjunction/comments/to8xog/anyone_have_any_opinions_on_what_kind_of_an/i2by2oh/,2,r/grandjunction,0,2

"Best comprehensive site for local hikes (and some not so local): [https://www.gjhikes.com/](https://www.gjhikes.com/)  
There are a lot of great suggestions here  so no sense in repeating anything (bear spray, imo, is not needed locally for a day hike, but you do you, nobody's judging).  
It really depends on several factors to what I bring; how long a hike, easy or hard hike (terrain), am I familiar with the area, location, time of year, time of day, alone or with others.    
That being said, always water and cell phone, even if I'm doing a short hike with no pack, I always have water and a cell phone.  No coverage? A handheld GPS and breadcrumb tracking is a godsend if lost.  
Don't skimp on a day pack, get something decent (good used deals on Main st: [https://www.thegearjunction.com](https://www.thegearjunction.com) ), an Osprey or something similar (someone mentioned 18L - perfect size, I can cram mine and my wife's stuff into it).

"Pros:
If you come from somewhere crowded and expensive like denver you'll love the lack of traffic and crowds here. Super close to all things outdoors such as climbing and disc golf and mountain biking. Everything is really close so you'll never need to drive across town to get a beer or whatever. We still have concerts and nice grocery stores and etc etc but it's just a smaller amount of each thing. Powderhorn is only 45 mins from town. The western slope produces a TON of fruit and vegetables and high quality meat and dairy if you're into sourcing quality local food/drink. There's a ton of blm around for shooting and what not, also a ton of camping and fishing I hear.
 It's a booming town that's only going to get bigger and bigger so investing in this place is smart. I love that people value their freedom here as well. 

Cons:
Far from most things like nice ski resorts etc (powderhorn isn't that great if you're really into tearing it up). Price of real estate is becoming crazy, and finding rentals is getting harder and harder. If you're single it's gonna be hard to date here in my experience.. Some people say there's a lot of trashy meth heads here but ive only seen like 1 sketchy person in the last 6 months so I don't buy it. There's not a ton of nightlife if that's something you're into but there seems to be a good event happening all the time so always something to do if you are super extrovert. The live music selection is pretty limited but they do a good job bringing stuff around and I feel like it's getting better and better. Downtown is also a bit limited like you arent going to find as much exotic foods and stuff like that but man there are some GOOD restaurants here like the types of places you'll want to frequent. Ok im mixing pros with Mt cons because this place is actually a gem.

"GJ is an interesting place. There's probably what you're looking for, whatever it is, but it's going to be a small but welcoming group. It'll probably be hard to find but once you get to know people things will start showing themselves. I'm in a lot of sports. Used to do indoor/outdoor soccer. Now softball, volleyball, and disc golf. Disc golf is super popular here and there's a number of courses in the area. There's a sneaky art scene. Had a friend that was into LARPing before he moved away. There's a decent homebrewed beer/wine/mead group here as well. 
In terms of places to avoid, idk. I came from Dallas and found the valley's ""sketchy"" areas to be pretty mild in comparison. The locals say to not go east of 29 Rd unless you're in Palisade. Certain parts of Orchard Mesa. Idk. You can Google maps an area and tell pretty quick if you'd be down for living there. Do note that if you live more than 12 min from people they probably won't drive to your place to hang out. Friends in GJ but you live in Palisade...you're on your own. 15-18min is too far.
Places to go: tough one. I've found I don't ""go out' like I used to. Now it's centered around an activity and what's nearby. Go mountain biking at 18 Rd and stop by Hot Tomato and a beer at Copper Club. Farmer's market and a sunset drink on the Avalon rooftop bar. Round of disc golf in Palisade with a bloody Mary from the distillery after. We will do a biking tour of wineries or the breweries near downtown.",t2_1klcsck,crumblynut,0,1647549809.0,0,t1_i12fd2j,i12fd2j,True,SnooDrawings1440,t3_tggpvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandjunction/comments/tggpvd/young_professionals_in_grand_junction/,Young Professionals in Grand Junction,/r/grandjunction/comments/tggpvd/young_professionals_in_grand_junction/i12fd2j/,3,r/grandjunction,0,3
"Low 30's here. I love road cycling and there's a good community of cyclists around here. I've lived over by Canyon View Park and in the Redlands area - both have been great. From what I understand, there are pockets in the Clifton, Fruitvale, and Orchard Mesa that are underserved areas in the community, but pretty easily avoidable. 

With a small family, we've enjoyed hikes, the ice rink, fruit picking, walking around downtown, and going to CMU events. Basketball is pretty much over, but it's been a fun season and the games have been great to go to and we're looking forward to seeing other sports. I have friends who do quite a bit of hunting, fishing, hitting trails in the side-by-side, and golfing. Really, if you're into something, Junction probably has it, but you'll need to search it out. 

If I were just moving here, I'd really weigh why people choose to come here - outdoors closeness. Consider taking up biking (mountain or road), cross-country skiing, trail running, hunting, etc. Those things are going to make staying here worth it. Other cities have good food and general activities, but to make the most of it all I'd encourage you to weigh what Junction has to offer.

"Budding mycologist here!

If you just want to try it out first and see if you like the idea of growing your own, grab a couple mushroom blocks from Fungi Ally! They are edible and delicious, and each flush I had was at least a pound before drying (i was able to get 4 flushes total, more than they said I would!), and it is so fun to watch them grow!

Plus, using a grow block you can decide if you and your family can handle the smell. Some mushrooms, like blue oysters, can be rather... potent. I stopped growing those after two flushes. Chestnut and mega phoenix are delicious in stews.

"“Shots fired”’is how law enforcement is trained to air any incident involving the discharge of firearms. It is legally neutral so the recordings don’t bias juries.

The suspect was charged with felony menacing and illegal possession of a weapon. That would indicate he had a firearm and pointed it at someone.  If the gun had gone off the charges would be different. Reckless endangerment if it was unintentional, assault with a deadly weapon and/or attempted murder if it was intentional. 

The affidavit is sealed to protect a victim or witness. Obviously not the trooper, who is identified.

The trooper is on paid administrative leave. That is standard following a use of deadly force. The CSP will have an internal investigation to see if the trooper violated policy/procedure. The CIRT will investigate potential crimes.

"> quality soil

We recently did a deep dive into soil food web techniques and picked up this [microscope](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0094JTZOU) so we could actually count and type the microbes present in our soils to distinguish healthy soil from bad. Turns out to be really easy.

Now I've become a microbiology geek collecting soil samples from all over the place in hope of inoculating our bulk soil with the best stuff from those collections.

"I changed my voter registration from Democrat to Unaffiliated, and made sure that I get two ballots for the primary election, Republican and Democrat ballots (I can only use one of them).

It would be very hard to get a Democrat voted in here. It would be easier to try to get a better Republican voted in.

I've been following Marina Zimmerman, she's a conservative Republican from Ignacio. She is running to primary Boebert. I met Marina at a meet and greet in January. I liked her. I talked to her, and I said, ""You don't sound like a Republican!"" We both laughed. She'd be much better than Boobert.

So, no, I don’t expect them to ‘unroll a warrant like medieval times’, but I do expect them to have a physical copy of a warrant, that has been signed by a judge, to present to the person who it is being served upon.  Like they are supposed to do in modern times.

"I filled out your google form.

I've got both a dog and a bird, so I filled out both sections.

For my dog, Korra, she's got most of the basics down, but could really use some help with extended obedience.

She passed the puppy star test, but I'd like her to be able to pass the canine good citizen test, and eventually train her to be a service dog for me. I struggle with a lot of anxiety, especially social anxiety, so she really needs to learn how to settle and be calm to be a proper service dog for me. Especially in public.

She's super smart. She learned sit in the first two days we had her.

Her biggest issue is she still nips and uses her teeth while playing. We've tried all sorts of things and she just won't stop. She's not trying to hurt people, but hyper dog teeth are sharp.

She also has the bad habit of stepping too far forward when healing. She wants to lead, or heal with the person in front, instead of the person who has the lead. It's frustrating to have to constantly tap or tug the leash to remind her.

She also barks, boofs, or boops at noises outside the house. Particularly when the neighbors close their car doors.

For our bird, Ozzie, she likes to try and murder my dad's ears and neck.

"You are saying a lot of ""I'm going to do this!"" and ""we are going to combat that!"" yet you have not described a plan. One without a plan, but with loud words, is a snake oil salesman. 

You also appear to be siding with people who have a proven history of acting in the best interests of themselves, not for Colorado. Also, with people who knowingly spread easily disproven election and Covid-19 misinformation. 

Boebert considers all Muslims to be terrorists, and Gardner voted against almost every possible legislation to help people on Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, and those in poverty.

"Man convicted of murder in 1991 Grand Junction pipe bombings seeks new trial through Innocence Project

By SHELLY BRADBURY | sbradbury@denverpost.com | The Denver Post PUBLISHED: January 24, 2022 at 12:04 p.m. | UPDATED: January 24, 2022 at 3:50 p.m.

“Nearly three decades after James Genrich was convicted of planting a series of pipe bombs in Grand Junction that killed two people and terrorized the community for months, the now-59-year-old returned to court Monday to argue that the guilty verdict was based on bogus evidence and should be overturned.

Attorneys for Genrich, who is serving life in prison for first-degree murder, argued in Mesa County District Court that the prosecution’s most critical piece of evidence in the case — an expert’s opinion that tools Genrich owned made marks on the bombs — was flawed, and that Genrich should be granted a new trial.

“That might have been enough to convict Mr. Genrich 30 years ago… but it is not enough today,” said Tania Brief, an attorney with the Innocence Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to exonerating wrongly convicted people.

During Genrich’s 1993 jury trial in Greeley, an expert for the prosecution matched tool marks on the bombs to three tools owned by Genrich, and told the jury that the marks on the bombs must have been made by Genrich’s tools. The expert said his analysis excluded the use of any other tools.

But a 2009 report by the National Academy of Sciences cast doubt on the expert’s methods, finding that the practice of tool-mark analysis was not scientifically validated and could lead to incorrect conclusions.

The tool marks were the only physical evidence tying Genrich to the crimes, and his conviction was controversial from the beginning. The case against him involved prosecutorial misconduct, tactics by law enforcement that a judge called “reprehensible” and a contempt-of-court charge for the prosecution’s tool-mark expert because he refused to turn over evidence to the defense despite court orders.

Mesa County District Attorney Dan Rubinstein said Monday he believes the tool-mark analysis that tied Genrich to the bombings was accurate.

“I stand by the conviction, and I stand by the reliability of the tool-mark evidence,” he said. “The experts that we have consulted with and intend to call at the hearing, we believe will support that this is reliable.”

The Colorado Court of Appeals in 2019 found that Genrich was entitled to a hearing to determine whether he should be given a new trial because of the potentially flawed tool-mark evidence. The hearing, which began Monday, is expected to last through Wednesday. District Court Judge Richard Gurley then has several weeks in which decide whether Genrich should be given a new trial.

Genrich has maintained his innocence since the 1991 attacks. Then 28, Genrich was living in downtown Grand Junction and working at the Two Rivers Convention Center when a bomb went off in the center’s parking garage on Feb. 14, 1991. A man was injured but no one was killed in that bombing.

In April 1991, a family got into their van in Grand Junction to go shopping and a bomb under a wheel well exploded, killing 12-year-old Maria Delores Gonzales. Just weeks later, in June, Henry Ruble, 43, and his wife were driving home from dinner in downtown Grand Junction when they spotted a strange object in the restaurant parking lot. Ruble picked it up and died when it exploded.

Investigators at the time faced immense public pressure to identify the bomber, and Genrich became a top suspect when he went to a bookstore after the three bombings and asked for a book that included instructions on bomb-making. Prosecutors relied heavily on circumstantial evidence to build the case, including notes Genrich wrote that were found in his apartment in which he expressed a desire to kill women and said he might harm “innocents.”

Genrich had been seen in some of the areas where the 1991 bombs detonated, and lived within walking distance of two sites. He’d studied electronics, and investigators found two fuses in his apartment that were the same type as those used in one of the bombs.

Investigators did not find any gunpowder, schematics or bomb-making tools in Genrich’s apartment. They did seize some of his tools, which the expert later matched to marks on an unexploded bomb that had been discovered in Grand Junction in 1989.

However, Genrich lived in Phoenix in 1989 and was at work in a bookstore there when the first bomb was placed in Grand Junction. (During the trial, prosecutors suggested he may have worked with an accomplice, but never named anyone.) Additionally, a white vehicle was seen at each of the 1991 bombings, and Genrich did not own or have access to a vehicle.

A witness also testified that he saw a “Spanish-looking man” handling one of the bombs; Genrich is white.

Genrich never admitted to the bombings, even when investigators followed him round-the-clock for months and his parents secretly wore a wire and tried to get him to confess.

In a 1993 interview with The Denver Post, Genrich said the homicidal notes he wrote were a practice he picked up in therapy — to write down what he was feeling instead of going out and “losing his temper.”

Genrich quickly appealed the 1993 conviction. The Mesa County district attorney who prosecuted the case, Steve ErkenBrack, told The Post then that he had “no doubt” about Genrich’s guilt. He declined to comment Sunday.

Months after Genrich’s conviction, The Post reported that enough doubt lingered in Grand Junction about his guilt that, even months after the verdict, some residents still checked their cars for bombs before leaving their driveways.”",t2_3snimuxh,SnackSize_,0,1643141014.0,0,t1_hu739wj,hu739wj,True,SnackSize_,t3_sclnqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandjunction/comments/sclnqu/man_convicted_of_murder_in_1991_grand_junction/,Man convicted of murder in 1991 Grand Junction pipe bombings seeks new trial through Innocence Project,/r/grandjunction/comments/sclnqu/man_convicted_of_murder_in_1991_grand_junction/hu739wj/,11,r/grandjunction,0,11

And I can attest to the atrocious health care in the area. If you are going to move here, get on a list for a PCP now because wait lists can be a months long.
