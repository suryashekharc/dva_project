"It takes a few months to find a good rental in western Massachusetts. I looked for three months before I found the right property. I loved living here so much I ended up buying the property. 

Western Massachusetts is very competitive when it comes to finding housing . Lots of people competing for the same limited amount of properties . 

I found Craigslist list helpful . 
I posted a housing wanted ad and the owner contacted me . 

Be prepared to have first , last and security on hand . Expect a credit and background check and employment verification . Most likely you’ll need a good previous rental history .  Also have good references . They guy I rented from and ultimately bought the property was very thorough and went back 10 years and verified everything on the application including a private background check and credit report . 

If you find a property you like pay the deposit that very instant or someone else will grab it up .

"RentNoho is by far the biggest rental agency in the area, but many people have really bad experiences with them. Speaking as an independent landlord (I rent out half of my two-family home), I know I could make more money going through RentNoho but chose not to because of their poor business practices. 

That said, they have a big chunk of the local rental market so discounting them completely makes finding housing tough, especially right now when housing is in really short supply in the area.

I wish I had more advice, but I'd say Craigslist is a good resource to find independent landlords. If you know anyone in the area who rents and likes their landlord you could see if you could reach out to their landlord for connection with other people who own rental units in Noho. Like for example, just through owning a two-family house I know a few other people who are in the same boat. I don't know of anyone with vacancies right now though.

"6'2”, white male perspective, (because the reality is, that this is a real factor to consider when the feeling of safety is concerned).

Northampton is a place where unless you go looking for trouble, you are not really going to find it.

Do I know people who have  suffered violent attacks in Noho? yes, I do. People who did not go looking, but really it's a rarity.

Every so often the panhandlers can feel aggressive, but for the most part, they are harmless.

There are some more jockey bars that tend to have a bit more posturing when people have a few to many. And now and then you get people from out of town wanting to make fun of the “freaks”.

"I’ve lived in the area since 2011 . 
I haven’t been a victim of any sort of crime nor do I know anyone that has been . 

Everyone I know walks around downtown late at night after going to dinner or seeing a local band play or having beers with friends with zero troubles . 

I can’t imagine where the statistics you mentioned came from . 

Only crimes I’ve even heard of is sometimes a car is broken into because someone left a purse on the front seat in plain sight . 

There are a few vagabonds wondering about downtown but most are nice and friendly and don’t harass anyone. 

I haven’t noticed any gang activity or anything that would remotely support those statistics. 

It’s a beautiful and fun small town with a hippie vibe . There are several universities nearby and it’s a very liberal hip upbeat area . 

I love it here . You will too . 

Who ever put together those statistics must have mixed Northampton up with Holyoke or Springfield. Both those cities are sort rough. 

The worst thing about Northampton is people will walk right out in front of moving vehicles. It’s the state law pedestrians have the right of way in a crosswalk . Which is fine . However , if it’s pouring rain at night they will just walk out in front of a moving car without even looking at all . There are lots of car versus pedestrian accidents in the downtown area . But that’s carelessness on the pedestrian’s part and the driver of the vehicle inability to see someone that walks into moving traffic without even looking up from their phone . If you are driving through the town square be prepared for a college student or shopper to walk out in front of you at any moment . Not a crime but yeah it’s one of the odd things about living here . 
Stop look and listen does not apply in Northampton . It’s up to the driver and their ability to see a pedestrian dressed head to toe in all black in a pitch black night while it’s raining or snowing that suddenly decides to walk into traffic without looking . BE CAREFUL WHEN DRIVING IN AND AROUND THE SQUARE !  NOT EVEN JOKING .

"Crime is definitely not 94% higher than national average.

From that source:

“Relative to Massachusetts, Northampton has a crime rate that is higher than 94% of the state's cities and towns of all sizes.” 

So I’d argue that Massachusetts isn’t a particularly unsafe state. This is saying that the crime rate here is higher that it is in almost all other parts of the state. However, it doesn’t say anything about how much higher or anything about how it compares to the national average. Could be twice as high as other towns could be 1% higher. It just doesn’t say.

That same source does go on to say:

“When NeighborhoodScout compared Northampton with other communities its size, we found that the crime rate was near the average for all other communities of similar size.”

Basically, Northampton has average crime stats.

">Genuine question…was NHS disproportionately refusing ‘students of color’ from entering the advanced classes, despite having the same academic qualifications as white students?

The way insidious but unintentional patterns often work is that little slights build on themselves so that by high school you have students whose records don't look as academically qualified.

That can include a wide variety of ingredients such as subtle (and often unintended) differences in teachers' expectations, and especially many aspects of family circumstance that are effectively multi-generational versions of the same self-reinforcing disadvantage.   Growing up in the public schools of an even less diverse community than Northampton, I can remember realizing even in first grade how my parents' education level created an advantage compared to many visually indistinguishable peers.

But the ""Embedded Honors"" idea is deeply misguided - the reason distinct classes are needed by high school isn't to cover the same material at differing levels of expectation, but literally to cover *different material* at the same points in a high school career.  Some college track students need to be ready for multi-variable calculus in their first college semester (some will even do that in high school), others are planning careers where functional ability in math and some general sense of totaling the area under a curve or being able to determine its rate of change are enough.

Disadvantaging Northampton's students isn't the answer - and actually would only increase inequity as families that can opt for Williston or whatever instead.  The actual answer is maintaining a range of options and trying to more broadly cultivate a fascination with learning in the earlier years, especially where effort is needed to offset the added legacy of challenges some students will enter elementary school with.",t2_19fvuaof,UniWheel,0,1648229151.0,0,t1_i238t0m,i238t0m,False,capybroa,t3_tkj0uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/tkj0uq/northampton_hs_principal_relieved_of_duties_after/,Northampton H.S. principal relieved of duties after calling students 'asshats',/r/northampton/comments/tkj0uq/northampton_hs_principal_relieved_of_duties_after/i238t0m/,1,r/northampton,0,1

"“students of color are disproportionately more likely to be placed in fundamentals classes, or be held out of advanced classes, than a white student with equal academic achievement.”

Genuine question…was NHS disproportionately refusing ‘students of color’ from entering the advanced classes, despite having the same academic qualifications as white students?

"Bit of background:  I teach in the district (though not at the High School right now) but I've had a chance to work with Ms. Vaillancourt in the past. This is my understanding of the situation as someone not at the HS, but hearing a lot of the gossip. If someone has more specific knowledge please feel free to correct me!

So, my understanding of the root of the problem was there used to be tiered math classes at the HS. In other words, Advanced Math for very proficient math students, regular math class and a ""fundamentals"" class for students that were behind in Math.

Administration decided to do away with tiered math classes and put all students in the same class. This concept is called ""mainstreaming"", mixing high achieving students with lower achieving students and holding them all to the same standard. The idea is that the higher achieving students will help raise the proficiency of the lower achieving students. 

This is also an ideology closely aligned with social justice movements, as students of color are disproportionately more likely to be placed in fundamentals classes, or be held out of advanced classes, than a white student with equal academic achievement.

The arguments around mainstreaming are super difficult because it is absolutely the case that advanced students don't get the same rigor and challenge in a non-advanced class, lowering their achievement ceiling. This is due to the practical difficulties of teaching a mixed-proficiency class as a teacher. It's incredibly difficult to design a single lesson that both challenges a high achiever and supports a student with weaker fundamentals at the same time. It also becomes almost impossible for the teacher to give one-on-one time to high achieving students as their focus in the room during class becomes supporting struggling students. 

So basically mainstreaming helps even the playing field for academically struggling students (often identified as minority students) somewhat at the expense of challenging high achieving students. 

Basically the students wanted the tiered math classes to remain, and principal Vaillancourt was telling teachers to continue to push that this is an equity decision to support minority students, hoping to get the social justice minded students at NHS on board. It wasn't working and she used some inappropriate language to describe some of the students that were disagreeing with the admin decision.

There's also a lot of background that exists around Ms. Vaillancourt's position as principal that may or may not be relevant. This is where some of my firsthand knowledge goes away, but I think it's worth mentioning. A few years ago when the previous principal left, some on the school committee had a successor kind of hand-picked. But during the interim Ms. Vaillancourt was the principal for a couple of years (? At least one year I know of) while they were getting their ducks lined up. During that time Ms. Vaillancourt got some supporters of her own and it ended up being a contentious decision because some people wanted this other person and others thought Principal Vaillancourt had done well in the interim and should be kept on. They ended up keeping her on, passing over the preferred candidate of some, but those people weren't happy about that. I don't know if that has a lot to do with the current situation or not, but I think it's interesting and important background. When I saw the comment from /u/icefisher225 it made me think about that.

So anyway, that's what I know (or have heard). I can also say that while working with Principal Vaillancourt she's been awesome. I think she's a great administrator that really cares about her students and staff. She creates a great working environment and really supports her teachers and does what good admin should do: find ways to make teacher's jobs *easier* rather than harder. I know some people who like her less, but she's always been fantastic in my experience.

Yeah, an increase in policing has diminishing returns but it has an effect if there is no enforcement to begin with!

"Waste of money. Noho sucks to walk in because it's designed for cars and has no traffic calming, not because people speed more than anywhere else. Your 'solution' is no different than the people who think the solution to crime is more police.

Get rid of all the on-street parking so pedestrians are more visible and have more space, and reduce the width of the street to one lane in each direction. Hell, there's room to put in an entire rotary in front of city hall, instead of that awful no-man's-land of an intersection. Build more parking (the lots behind the academy of music by the bike path are perfect for another parking garage) and encourage traffic to go around downtown.

"I know Northampton is pretty anti-police and anti-surveillance, but I'm all for this. Frankly, Northampton is a horrible town for driving, walking or biking in, all because of drivers who are aggressive and speed way too much. 

The passing on the right shoulder thing when someone is trying to make a left turn on a two lane road is freaking absurd. I've lived all over the country and nowhere else do people do this super reckless and dangerous move. Why come out of your lane to zoom past someone just to avoid breaking for like 10 seconds while they take their turn? It's totally crazy.  

I've had people on South Street buzz past my right mirror with just a few inches to spare doing a full 45-50mph. Note, they swerve into the freaking bike lane to do it. 

I wish Northampton police were *more* aggressive with traffic mitigation. I've been hit biking, I know many people who have been hit biking and walking, and I literally don't know anyone who hasn't had to dash out of a crosswalk multiple times to avoid someone not stopping for pedestrians on a road like King Street or Pleasant Street.

"You're saying everyone is driving slowly, so if everyone is doing it how is an affront to the overall driving style? Sounds like the overall driving style is slow on this road.

That said, you want a more urban planning answer? It's the narrowness of the road. Route 5 is narrow there with little shoulder, that encourages slower driving because people get nervous rushing towards traffic in the other lane with little room to move over if someone drifts towards the center.

The other factor is the scenery. Rivers and trees make people slow down. It's a well established psychological response when driving. 

In fact, you can see both of these elements in play with the traffic mitigation strategies Northampton is employing all over town. To slow down traffic they make the road more narrow, like they're doing on King Street right now. On King Street the goal is to make the section from Main Street to around Stop and Shop more pedestrian-friendly, so shops in that section can get more foot traffic. 

Narrow the road, plant some trees, slow down traffic.

It's not some grand conspiracy, just well established and known patterns in traffic flow. Instead of getting mad at apparently everyone, either take a different route, or just learn to live with it.",t2_6tbpo,Shovelbum26,0,1634575181.0,0,t1_hh4judc,hh4judc,False,[deleted],t3_q94ejb,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/q94ejb/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/northampton/comments/q94ejb/deleted_by_user/hh4judc/,3,r/northampton,0,3

"No, it is. It's a passing zone from PCA almost to Atwood Drive, which is what I assume is the location you're referring to by ""the river alongside the road"" which by that I assume you mean the Oxbox. You cannot see the river from Route 5 in Northampton. You can check yourself on Google Maps. 

Regardless, if you're saying you can't pass because there's too many vehicles, then maybe there's a reason why people are driving slower. In other words, an active, narrow, poorly-paved state highway with no breakdown lanes. Also, there is a railway that intersects it, a packaging corporation with heavy truck access, bicycle traffic which has to ride in-lane, two major stop-light intersections with I-91, and an active construction site for about a quarter mile modifying the travel lane.

I've found that traffic is often pretty light by then though so I would make use of the passing opportunities you get. Also as somebody who has lived a lot of other places besides this one, Western MA has a really weird driving culture where a lot of people drive slowly without any real reason and also seem to lack basic self-awareness about their surroundings, on and off the road.

"Plenty of room for pedestrians to walk two abrest, cyclists should really be using the oncoming lane to pass even a single person walking.  And yes, that sometimes means slowing to wait for an opening.

A bell is a very useful thing, not to get people to move (unless they're spilling to the left of center, no need for them to) but just to let them know you're there.

The local trail user population is really very aware and cooperative... try riding other places if you want to see issues.

Also with a very few exceptions like Damon Road and parts of King Street most of the roads are fine to ride on.  Those two are even slated for lanes or paths, which will further narrow what to avoid to things like downtown (safe enough but annoying) and of course rt 5 between the rotary and Oxbow.

"On the flip side, but also related, you have people practically tripping over themselves to give up their right away to cyclists in dangerous situations. The number of times I've been trying to turn left off of King St (the four lane road part) and have had an oncoming car stop and try to wave me through while cars in the other oncoming lane are passing them is astounding. Or having a driver stop for me to cross the road in the middle of the block (ie, no cross walk, just trying to turn into traffic) and bringing traffic to a standstill. Then they realize I can't go so get on the move again, but then someone from the other side wonders why everyone was stopped so decides to stop, but now the first lane is moving again. Rinse and repeat until you get into a shouting match with someone who insists you go and just turn around to let traffic flow return to normal.

The real nail in the coffin was her decision to stay on in Super Tuesday. It was clear this was a Bernie/Biden race at that point, and most of the other candidates had dropped out and endorsed Biden. Not Warren. No, she stayed in and siphoned off enough votes in a bunch of states to ensure Biden won convincingly. She even came in third in good old MA.

Then after her crushing loss did she finally decide to drop out and endorse her progressive peer? Did she stick with her principles and support the only viable candidate  who would enact universal healthcare? No. She hid away until Biden had taken the nomination and then endorsed him.

"I hate Suher as much as the next guy, but to blame Northampton's housing issue on him is going a bit far.

I have lived here for decades and things are much worse now than they have been since the state hospital closed its doors and rampant arson and other crime ailed the town. It’s almost certainly amplified by covid. Pulaski Park has not been a safe place for most people to visit due to needles and threats over invading peoples “areas” for some time now.

I have never felt threatened by any of the homeless there. I'm a large white dude. So obviously I have that going for me.

My girlfriend consistently had ok interactions with homeless in town when she was on her own, walking to a bar, eating pita pocket in the park etc.

I know this is anecdotal and obviously it's a complicated issue. People are homeless for many different reasons. Likely the choice is out of their hands at this point too. But I can almost guarantee there is a lot of pearl clutching going on in hamp over the homeless. There always will be.

"I'm glad they caught the people who did this. There's been a lot of controversy about the park lately. On the one hand, I have compassion for the homeless people who spend their days there, but I'd like to think that it should also be a safe space for college kids and families too.

The park should be safe for all, including the homeless and the tax-payers who maintain it and college kids and their families.  It's a tricky situation.  I believe the city should provide more affordable housing to the people living out on the street, and extend the eviction moratorium.  I know some people are just down on their luck.  

Just the other day they posted a park clean up notice:  [https://i.imgur.com/ATHlX9F.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ATHlX9F.jpg)  I think they are going to really make a statement.  Also I think the homeless population will decrease as it starts to get colder.

"Yes, you will regret it! We moved to the area last May and decided not to get a snowblower--we have an All-wheel drive vehicle and wouldn't have any issues getting out. However, we regretted the decision so much that we went and bought one in January! Snow falls last year ranged from a dusting (no big deal) to 12+ inches overnight. Part of the issue is that the snow sticks around for awhile after it falls. Once compacted in your driveway, it takes longer to melt. We ended up going through many cycles of the snow melting a tiny bit from the sun and then freezing into long sheets of ice. Delivery trucks (Amazon, heating oil, etc) couldn't get up our flat, but ice covered, driveway.

"I live in a small town nearby but grew up with Northampton as my backyard. First, Covid has done a number on the downtown. Tons of empty shops and restaurants have closed. Will it bounce back? I hope so. One of the big issues is that A LOT of the downtown property is owned by a single person and that person keeps the rents HIGH. He has priced out so many businesses, they have all turned to Amherst. Amherst's downtown was booming and expanding by a lot.

There is also a newer population of homeless people that have turned to a more aggressive form of panhandling called ""harrassing."" If you aren't okay with this, and please believe me when I tell you that the Smith College population is NOT, then downtown can get dicey at certain times of day.

"To me, one problem with Northampton is everyone trying to preserve it in some artificial state because they are enjoying living a relatively privileged existence.

For example, Northampton is mostly moderately affluent white people. This is because housing is so fucking expensive in this town (and I say this as a Northampton homeowner). 

Every time some kind of big housing project comes up like The Lumberyard or anything theres a big hoopla about ""Oh this is going to make Northampton too urban and ruin the vibe of the town. It's getting too developed and losing the small town side!""

To me this is summed up as getting through the door and slamming or shut behind you. Northampton is a great place to live and to keep it that way no one else can live here. 

In addition to being a homeowner we have a multifamily home and we price it waaaaay below the rental market. I could make a few thousand more a year by going through RentNoho instead of being a private landlord. But to hell with that, people with lower incomes should be able to live in Northampton.

"I think Lyme is a cause for concern, *but* you're also overthinking it. Everywhere is going to have some environmental hazards, and this happens to be one of New England's risks. I've had Lyme twice, once when I was 8 and again when I was 21. I'd still rather kick it in New England with Lyme than elsewhere with something like [Chagas](https://asm.org/Articles/2021/April/Chagas-Disease-in-the-U-S-What-We-Know-About-the-K).

Invest in some full-coverage, light-colored clothing for outdoor activities. Yes, your kids will probably complain, but it's the same as nagging them about putting on sunscreen or brushing their teeth. It's just another everyday protection/prevention method.

I'd suggest doing your own research about Permethrin, the chemical used to repel ticks, and decide what feels safe for your family. Most research suggests that Permethrin-treated clothing is safe for adults and children (it doesn't absorb into our skin very easily), but can be mildly toxic to pets and highly toxic to wildlife, such as fish and bees (but a lot of the studied toxicity to animals is preventable with responsible use).

For a more natural prevention method, you can always contact a local wildlife rehabilitation center and volunteer your property as an opossum release site 😁",t2_9xegk,emilylake,0,1627402044.0,0,t1_h6pyky7,h6pyky7,True,totalbeef13,t3_osha2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/osha2y/scared_of_lyme/,Scared of Lyme,/r/northampton/comments/osha2y/scared_of_lyme/h6pyky7/,7,r/northampton,0,7

Lots of good suggestions in that first comment! Cute cafes and store! I love eating at Jake’s for breakfast or Sylvester’s is good too! I’d suggest walking Main Street and checking out the stores and Thornes. Get something cold and sweet at Herrells or GoBerry. If the weather is nice take out one of the Valley Bikes and ride it to Florence (Pie Bar) or Easthampton. There’s also a nice walking trail behind Smith College and even if the inside portion of the Botanical Garden is closed there is still lots of plants/flowers to check out.

"     Noho is a great city for walking/biking. If you park somewhere near downtown, you can get to tons of fun stores and restaurants by foot. 

     Ghost bread bakery is a local gem, lots of affordable and tasty baked goods, with a very unique location. Haymarket cafe is a funky little cafe wedged in amongst the main street shops. There are a couple of quirky consignment/vintage clothing stores, as well as a classic corner candy store. Thorne's Marketplace is like a mini-mall, but with all local businesses. The Toasted Owl is a cozy restaurant with interesting decor. There's a couple cheap pizza places downtown, I think one place sells by the slice. Multiple Indian restaurants in the area, as well as Mediterranean, sushi, noodles, etc. Plenty of dietary options(vegan, vegetarian, GF, etc) in the area, especially in Northampton.

     There are multiple beautiful colleges in the area, and I think one of them has a botanical garden that is open to the public? No idea if it is still open, but East Haven hot tubs is a great experience for special occasions.

     One of the neighboring towns, Florence, has a quaint downtown area that reminds me of the 1950s, as well as Look Park, which is a beautifully maintained park.

     Another neighboring town, Hadley, is a farm town nestled between 2 college towns. It has a full mall and cinema, your typical chain stores and restaurants, etc. If you go off the main road that runs from Noho to Amherst, you can really see the farming roots of Hadley. Plenty of farm stands and such.

     The Manhan Rail Trail runs through Easthampton(another neighbor, this one with an old mill town flavor to it, great spot as well!), Northampton, Amherst and into Belchertown. It's a paved bike trail built over an old railroad, complete with rest stops, gorgeous views of Hadley's fields, great access to downtown Noho, and rentable motor-assisted bicycles. If you are into retro gaming, Quarters is a retro arcade bar in Hadley, and is accessable from the rail trail.

     Plenty of outdoor stuff in the area, including white water rafting and kayaking. There's also a few businesses on the Deerfield river that will rent you a tube and you can float down the river to your car downstream.

     I'm sure there is a lot I'm forgetting/don't know about, but this should get you started.",t2_au0eta02,KwisatzHaderachPrime,0,1624188482.0,0,t1_h2f2qo8,h2f2qo8,True,[deleted],t3_o3qwo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/o3qwo8/day_trip_recommendations/,Day Trip Recommendations?,/r/northampton/comments/o3qwo8/day_trip_recommendations/h2f2qo8/,2,r/northampton,0,2

"I have lived here a long time and eaten **everywhere,** but I am going to overlook the very well-known restaurants for the sake of these recommendations. 

**Coffee:**

Yup. Coffee in Florence has fantastic coffee and an adorable cafe, but are currently closed due to the pandemic. Catalpa Coffee in Northampton is my #2 coffee choice (I tend to avoid cafes that serve Esselon beans).

**Lunch/dinner:**

(Northampton)

Pita Pocket remains, in my opinion, the best lunch spot in Northampton. Not only do they have an incredibly friendly and hard-working owner, but their food is priced incredibly well, and delicious.

Bombay Royale has great Indian food. I've heard from all of my friends born in the Indian subcontinent that they have the best Indian food they're yet to have in the United States, for what it's worth. Their lunch buffet is an especially good deal, when they're offering it.


(Amherst)

Halal Cart in Amherst is a fantastic, NYC-style halal cart. You can get chicken wraps for $5, chicken/rice plates for $6, and is probably the best value food I can think of in the area, especially when accounting for how delicious it is. Additionally, their hot sauce is **hot.** As a lover of extreme spice, a healthy serving of their hot sauce is pushing my limits, but most will find it delicious in smaller quantities.

Formosa in Amherst is, without question, the best Chinese food in the area. Their lunch specials are great, and if you're seeking fantastic hot and sour soup, look no further. Living in Northampton, I drive to Formosa before considering getting Chinese food anywhere in Northampton. Highly recommended for lunch/dinner, and their Peking duck is rather good for special occasions, as well.

**Well-established local restaurants for newcomers who are unfamiliar** (that I would recommend - won't be offering analysis for these):

(I won't be offering analysis for these. Bold for exceptional food)

BBQ - **Bub's BBQ**

Chowder - Smithsonian Chowder House

La Veracruzana - Mexican/Latin food

Noodles - Ramen

Pizza - **Joe's Pizza**

Pizza - Florence Pizza


Pizza slices - Pinocchio's

"While I surrender that ""defund the police"" is a bad saying, the intention behind it isn't. For decades, public services that should have been operated under their own departments have been thrown under the veil of police operations. I don't think anybody with an educated viewpoint thinks that we should totally eliminate a police-like force for serious violators of violent crimes, but largely what the police do these days is force criminality upon individuals that have been failed by their social systems, or have ""violated laws"" that just aim to persecute the lowest financial class in our society. What defunding the police aims to do is divert the funds that the police receive for dealing with these psychological and social issues to new departments that are more apt to handle those situations, and reserving police resources for handling violent situations.

If you haven't noticed, the crime that occurs in Northampton is largely a result of the opioid epidemic. If we had social resources to better cater to those suffering from their addictions, they wouldn't be as motivated to commit petty crimes, thereby lowering the incident rate that the police have to respond to.",t2_9p5tqk5z,JoesHouseSpecial,0,1623857476.0,0,t1_h1z878c,h1z878c,True,[deleted],t3_o175rb,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/o175rb/invest_in_noho_divest_from_npd/,"Invest in Noho, divest from NPD?",/r/northampton/comments/o175rb/invest_in_noho_divest_from_npd/h1z878c/,13,r/northampton,0,13

Most construction in the past 10-20 years are luxury condominiums and townhomes. New construction that is affordable for someone who actually is restricted by rent is basically non-existent or only accessible with an application to one of the very few affordable housing units in the area and a long wait time.

"I don't know what that guy has against Northampton Area Pediatrics (NAP) but we've been going to them since my daughter was born, so 5 years, and they're great.

Changes on main street is a great salon. I actually go to a place in Easthampton called The Colour Bar, the person who I used to see at Changes started her own salon and so I go there now.

IMO Bombay Royale is better (and cheaper) than India House. T. Roots has great Taiwanese food. Mi Tierra in Hadley is hands down the best Mexican food in the area. Homestead is a great place to eat and before COVID they had free pasta for kids after a certain time. Not sure if they still do that.

Look Park is great for kids, our daughter loves the splash pad there. Definitely worth it for the year pass, especially if they open up paddle boats and stuff this summer. However, Jackson Street School is free has the best playground in the area by a long shot, but of course only available after school hours or in the summer! 

I'll second Musante Beach for swimming with a kid, the water is not super cold like some other spots tend to be, and it's very open and no current to speak of. Worth it for the yearly pass IMO. There are some other good hidden swimming holes I can direct you to if you're interested. 

Eric Carle Museum is weirdly more for adults than kids. The Children's Museum in Holyoke is a great interactive space, but it's often very crowded on weekends. 

If I think of any other good kids spots I'll let you know. Mill 180 used to be our go-to, espeically when it was super hot or super cold (it's basically an indoor park) but they totally changed how they worked during COVID and so we haven't been in like a year and a half now.

"my regular spiel for renting in the area, sorry if it's a little bleak or a drag !

\-everything is pretty expensive. a one bedroom is going to run you at least 1200/mo in northampton. anything less is probably going to be a little shitty (but liveable. depends on what you're used to/your standards). 

\-there are students everywhere. more undergrads typically live in off campus housing in amherst than in northampton but this entire area is full of colleges-- you'll find less students in easthampton, florence, holyoke, and places north.

\-don't worry if you don't see much right now. really start looking for rentals in july--most places don't post until a few weeks out.

"Just think of it like this, Northampton is not Boston, nor is it Williamstown. The state mandate is meant to be the bare minimum, each city had to think of it's unique situation to find the system that is right for it.

And once that system is in place there needs to be a process to change it. The current mask regulations were debated and approved by city council.

"This is super exciting news! But just to clarify, Northampton has its own mask mandate that is not being rescinded. 

The guidance recently changed to adults don't need to be masked outdoors if 6 feet can be maintained (so less busy sidewalks, bike path, etc.). But indoors except when eating and outdoors when 6 feet cannot be maintained (Main Street on a busy weekend) still require masks.

Here is the full text of the most recent updates on mask mandates in Northampton:

> **For Immediate Release - May 5, 2021**

> **Northampton Board of Health Rescinds COVID-19 Mandatory Face Coverings in Public Places Policy**


> NORTHAMPTON - Effective May 6th, 2021, the City of Northampton Board of Health COVID-19 Mandatory Policies and Procedures for Wearing of Face Masks or Other Faces Coverings in Public Places in the City of Northampton will be rescinded. Face covering requirements will reflect those of the Commonwealth. These requirements and exemptions are as follows. 


> Face coverings will continue to be required at all times in the following situations and settings:

>  * Inside or waiting in line outside of grocery stores, retail stores, pharmacies, and restaurants

>  * Providing or using the services of any public or shared transportation, including taxis, ride shares (Uber, Lyft, etc), bus, train, plane

>  * Public streets and ways where physical distancing of at least 6 feet cannot be maintained

>  * Any location, including hotels, event venues, and private clubs, that hosts indoor or outdoor events or performances


> Face coverings are optional in the following situations and settings

>  * Outdoors where at least 6 feet of distance from other people can be continuously maintained. This includes public parks, bike paths, walkways, and other outdoor settings where physical distancing is easily maintained. This does not include venues, hotels, and other businesses that host indoor or outdoor events.

>  * When communicating with someone who has a hearing impairment or other disability

>  * In specific circumstances, such as when eating or drinking in restaurants, receiving dental care, or participating in water sports and swimming

>  * In private outdoor and indoor settings, in small groups with members of the same household or non-household members


> There are multiple considerations behind the decision to rescind the Northampton Face Mask Order. Notably, there has been significant decrease in case counts across the state and here in Northampton. While it is not time to become complacent by any means, more stringent face covering requirements do not reflect the current status of transmission risk in the state or the municipality. 


> When ample physical distancing is maintained, the risk of transmission is significantly reduced outdoors. The largest drivers of spread are social gatherings, events, and other crowded settings indoors where distancing is difficult to maintain and the air is not as well-ventilated as it is outdoors. While not entirely impossible, it is statistically much less likely that the virus will spread between people who are outside and also distanced. For this reason, face masks are optional when outdoors and when able to maintain a distance of 6 feet from other people. 


> Of emphasis, as more of our population gains access to and obtains vaccination, we are progressively more protected against the virus. This added layer of protection is beginning to complement other measures such as mask-wearing, physical distancing, and staying home when ill. Vaccine eligibility has now expanded to everyone in the population who is 16 years and older. As of Sunday, May 2nd, approximately 2.6 million of our total population of 6.9 million were fully vaccinated and approximately 6.3 million vaccines have been administered in the state, including first and second doses. Vaccinations are our best protection against COVID-19 and our greatest tool in working towards completely eliminating the need for mask requirements and other restrictions at the statewide, nationwide, and global levels. Everyone is strongly encouraged to get the vaccine when it becomes available to them, even if they have previously recovered from COVID-19. To make an appointment for vaccination at the Northampton Senior Center go to https://www.northamptonma.gov/2219/Vaccine-Clinics.

"Oh you'll fit right in! It's a 10-15 minute drive on a section of Route 91 highway that rarely has traffic. This area of MA is generally pretty easy to travel.

"It's worth bringing up because it creates an inefficiency in our housing market, and an inefficiency that's especially unique to Northampton. The fact that anti-discrimination laws only apply to landlords is exactly what I'm saying. This means that if a woman gets the initial lease on a 3 bedroom apartment in town, they then get to choose who sublets the other two rooms from them without having to give regard to anti-discrimination laws. Given the demographics of Northampton, these initial leases are overwhelmingly claimed by women, or queer folx. Examining the listings for room rentals in town, you can see that the majority of them exclude men, unless they're queer. This means that straight men either have to live in a surrounding town, or rent a single-occupant apartment, which both add a great deal to their living costs (either with transportation, or higher rent). I have no problem with people deciding who they live and share a space with. I was just letting OP know that they're unlikely to find the housing situation they're looking for within the borders of Northampton.",t2_9p5tqk5z,JoesHouseSpecial,0,1621256739.0,0,t1_gyfvc46,gyfvc46,False,UT_MRU95,t3_ne4gor,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/ne4gor/roommatehousing_group/,Roommate/Housing group,/r/northampton/comments/ne4gor/roommatehousing_group/gyfvc46/,4,r/northampton,0,4
"I'm pretty sure the anti discrimination statutes apply to landlords, not tenants. The government cannot compel you to share a lease with someone. It just won't let landlords discriminate.

"If you’re male, you’re going to have a hard time finding an existing room in a house for rent. Since MA allows existing tenants to discriminate against otherwise protected classes when selecting a roommate to sublet a shared space, these apartments are often first rented by either women of members of the queer community, and are then effectively off limits to straight men (I imagine you have encountered this if you’ve already looked at some ads). You’re likely going to have to live in a surrounding town if you need roommates.

EDIT: I’m not sure why this is being downvoted when this is just a fact of the housing market in Northampton. I never stated that I have a problem with this. It’s a good thing that people are able to decide who they cohabit a space with without having to give regard to anti-discrimination laws.

"you might have some luck in easthampton or leeds. otherwise check in holyoke or greenfield/turners if you don't mind a bit of a drive. unfortunately, you will not likely find a 2bdr apartment for less than 1800/mo near northampton that isn't at least a little run down or with a peanut-sized kitchen. sadly what i've seen over the past few years is higher and higher rents despite most units being small and ranging from meh-but-liveable to truly busted condition.  i've found the timing doesn't really matter. students will always be coming to school, or moving to an apartment for the summer, or graduating and finding a place. 

as depressing as this all sounds, gems \*do\* pop up on craigslist ! just keep your eyes peeled. and, as everyone has said, don't use rentnoho.",t2_l4yno,k123abc,0,1620255497.0,0,t1_gx338b0,gx338b0,True,TTTA,t3_n54891,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/n54891/nonstudent_housing_within_30_minutes_of/,Non-student housing within 30 minutes of Northampton,/r/northampton/comments/n54891/nonstudent_housing_within_30_minutes_of/gx338b0/,3,r/northampton,0,3
"I live in a property called University Drive,  but has other names, owned by Vesta. I am a 33 year old single person, and I haven’t seen any students in my building, but they might have their own, there is also one for seniors only, families, etc. 

It’s a three floor apartment building set in the woods, a paved bike trail goes directly to Northampton parallel to the main rd (crossing the Calvin Coolridge Bridge).

 The property manager and leasing agent are incredible women, and even went out of their way to bring the price into my budget range. The one bedrooms are all two, actually, but one doesn’t have egress so can’t be called a bedroom. It’s called a den but can be an Offixe or whatever, open floor plan, and comes with a garden plot :) 

It’s a straight drive to the middle of Northampton, ten minutes or twenty in traffic. But I walk there. I think 1bdroom is around 900

Edit: it’s in Hadley, Ma.",t2_3kzs5rig,nauseated-aauugh,0,1620252529.0,0,t1_gx2wuwf,gx2wuwf,True,TTTA,t3_n54891,https://www.reddit.com/r/northampton/comments/n54891/nonstudent_housing_within_30_minutes_of/,Non-student housing within 30 minutes of Northampton,/r/northampton/comments/n54891/nonstudent_housing_within_30_minutes_of/gx2wuwf/,5,r/northampton,0,5

"Yeah, they are terrible on both sides of the owner/renter relationship. I had a moment of weakness one summer when I got sick of people ghosting on showings. I listed 2 vacancies through them and they did a terrible job. 

The only tenant I've ever had to evict in the 2 decades I've been doing this came from Rent Noho.
