"I live in LA right now. Specifically I live in Glendale. My wife and I will be moving to Tampa after two years in LA to be close to family. Outside of the climate and the natural beauty (mountains, parks) there really isn't much good I can say about LA, though I understand my view of the city is tainted somewhat cause I moved here 8 days before a lockdown that lasted an entire year. In my opinion LA is an unviable city to live in for people who aren't wealthy or established. But Miami might have become that way too while I've been gone.

With that being said, I also lived in brickell in Miami. In terms of comparing brickell to glendale, brickell is much nicer than glendale. All my friends and family are also in the Pembroke Pines area, which also lends to my bias. I miss it every day.

Pros of LA
- distance to national parks. Joshua tree is incredible. Sequoia national park and Yosemite are 8 hours away.
- number of parks is incredible.
- lots of culture
- jobs 
- literal perfect climate

Cons of LA

- cost of living is unviable. A 3 bedroom house costs 1.5 million dollars in Glendale, which is a bad area compared to something like Pasadena. 

- homeless situation is overwhelming. It's a massive problem that has no answer. This is multi-generational issue and isn't really LA's fault. 

- LA infrastructure is terrible. I used to complain about Miami, but LA is awful in comparison.

- Traffic (too many people)

- Taxes, if you make more than 45k the taxes don't really benefit you. 

Pros of Miami
- also has nice climate, but very hot.
- lots of culture
- cuban food 
- also other wonderful restaurants just like LA.
- no state tax
- inexpensive compared to LA, but not significantly so outside of tax relief.

Cons of Miami
- far from everything natural park related. 8 hour drive to get out of the state.
- job selection is poor compared to LA, though it's improving I hear. 
- low wages, even with tax relief.
- extremely hot in summer. 
- will probably be underwater in our lifetime.
- much smaller than LA
- no parks. Like at all. 
- people aren't as friendly.

"I’m born and raised in Miami and still live in Miami, but I travel to LA a lot for work. I usually spend at least a month at a time in LA. 

The pros for Miami for me is the culture. You can a find a bit of everything in Miami when it comes to food and just people in general. The cons for Miami is the rain and the humidity.

The only pro for LA is that you actually have all 4 seasons of the year so you have more to choose from clothing/style wise.

The Cons for LA is that there isn’t much variety and just about EVERYTHING is Mexican, Salvadoran, Asian or Armenian, but mostly Mexican. So not much to choose from when it comes to food or the dating pool. They also charge for just about everything (shopping bags at the store), everything is more expensive, and just about everything causes cancer in California apparently. Also there is cops everywhere. I had never seen in any other state, cops swerving left to right on the freeway in order to stop traffic, cause it supposedly prevents people from speeding. Oh, and there is also the homeless.

"I moved from LA to Miami this past summer, after 20+ years in the valley. Every time people ask me about how the two are different, I say the same thing…they have much more in common than people seem to think. At the end of the day, it’s a coastal mega city with major suburban sprawl. Culturally, yeah it’s pretty different. The vibes are not as “chill” but that doesn’t mean they’re bad. It’s just high energy, for better or worse. The one thing I do miss about LA is that distinct valley culture (it’s a weird thing to say I know). The suburbs here are just kind of…well, nothing really distinct to say about them. I live in the Grove, and I honestly think of all the cities I could have moved to, Miami is the least different from LA. 

A couple quick comparisons based on my almost 1 year here:

Food - LA. Asian and Mediterranean options especially are way worse here. 

Weather -  LA. Caveat that Winter/Spring are paradise here, but the humidity in the summer is just killer. I’ll take the dry heat any day. 

Beaches - Miami. I like SM and Malibu as much as the next guy, but I also enjoy not freezing my ass off when I get in the water. They’re also generally cleaner. 

Nightlife - Miami. It’s just built different, not much more to say. 

Diversity / Neighborhoods - LA. This is probably just a function of size, but a lot more unique neighborhoods in LA. 

Driving - It’s a split. Traffic isn’t as bad (no matter what people here seem to believe lol), but drivers are much worse.

"I've lived in both. Grew up in Miami, now live in LA.

LA has better weather by a million miles. It has better food diversity. Culture is more diverse. The politics are better (I feel like I still have trauma from exile politics NGL). If you like getting out in nature, it's better (desert, mountains, ocean, all right there). In LA, you've got Palm Springs, Santa Barbara, San Diego, all within two hours and each has a very different feel to it than LA. You can go hiking right in the city and feel like you're in nature. Miami has the Everglades, which I love and miss, but most people just drive through on their way to Naples  and never get to know them. Orlando is a nothing city. Miami does have warmer ocean water, but the last few times I've gotten in the ocean in Miami, I've been chased out by jellyfish. I do miss the Keys, though, there's nothing like them in California, or the rest of the world, for that matter.

Miami used to have better traffic, but it sucks almost as much now and everything is a toll road. You can get decent Cuban food in LA, but it's really hard to find decent Mexican food in Miami. You cannot get decent Cuban coffee in LA, I've been trying for fifteen years. I, personally, find Miami more superficial which is ironic given everyone thinks LA is the epitome of superficial. Both are full of transplants without deep roots, but I feel like Miami is worse. Also, I find Miami to be a fundamentally dishonest city. Everybody has a hustle. The lack of community ties means everyone looks out for number  one, always. There's some of that in LA, but not anywhere the degree in Miami. Even my family are shady AF, lol.

All in all, I much prefer LA. I enjoy visiting Miami these days and I miss my family that is still there, but LA just feels like a more grown up city to me. But everyone is different.

You have to call the department of state phone number and specifically tell them you’re traveling within 7 days and you need a passport asap!!!! They will make you an appointment. Even if your appointment says that you have to be there at 10 AM get there at 7 AM. There’s always a long line. The appointment gets you in the door regardless of what the time is!!!! first come first serve. And make a itinerary showing that you’re leaving within a couple days and you’ll get the passport before the date on the itinerary. For example if your itinerary says that you’re leaving in three days they were printed and two. Another is that if your itinerary stand that you’re leaving that morning your passport would be printed same day. They always go off the travel date that’s on your itinerary.

"I've lived in the suburbs of each for 7+ years each. Like a lot of people are saying, LA is generally more friendly to strangers and a slower pace than Miami. In Miami, people won't really give you the time of day if you're not part of their established family or friend group and is faster paced, though less structured. I think if you're able to find a good community of people in Miami, the closeness and loyalty of that group will exceed anything that LA could offer. My experience living in Miami was not dominated by partying, and there is a lot to do with regards to going to the beach and being involved in a local community and exploring the city. It has a lot of things that LA offers, but it's just a different place. If you're willing to take the time to put yourself out there and get involved with the people in Miami, you might love it.

"Grew up in LA, been here for almost 5 years now.

Depends on what you like/dislike about LA I think. Also, what part of LA?

I'm from the South Bay Area, always found LA to be super boring and pretentious growing up. The ""chillness"" was so contrived for me. Like a big vat of unsweetened fat free greek yogurt with a few sprinkles of spices and a pepita on top to pretend there's something interesting going on inside.

I spent a few years in the rural south and found it surprisingly refreshing, and loved the ""you be you""-ness, but it was a little too sparsely populated for this Replicant. So I love Miami because it just feels like you can be you, whatever that is. There's a place for it. 

I have a friend who calls it ""functional chaos"" and that works well for my personality. The hardest thing for me here is the disregard for the environment and what seems to be personal responsibility. I have never seen people dump actual bags of trash out the window before, outside of developing countries. Also have never seen people not only refuse to return their shopping carts, but also recklessly back up their own cars into said abandoned carts. It's a wild ride.

Also, not much for ethnic food (scene is growing), fine and performing arts scenes are very green, be prepared to over pay for crappy vegetables and fruit, and the summer humidity is a STRUGGLE. But the energy is incomparable. It's highly navigable, and you can definitely find your place here. I always felt so lost in LA.

"Originally from NYC lived in LA. Now hubby and I are in South Florida. We are 20 minutes from Miami in Fort Lauderdale. We chose Ft. L the housing is slightly cheaper but there are different cultures besides the Latino culture. If you're white be prepared to be the minority. I'm a ""lightskinned"" black woman, I'd say Beyonce's color. Im half Caribbean with a latina last name. I have a body type that latinas are attracted to. The people here treat me like a goddess. I don't speak Spanish fluently but everyone encourages me to learn. There are many things I love about latin culture. The friendliness, the festive spirit and the food. However the customer service needs much improvement. You can call a business they may or may not answer. They may or may not return a call. They may or may not be on time for an appointment. They may or may not remember an appointment.

Be prepared if you have to seek housing here be VERY prepared. I think CA has a cap on application fees for apartments. Here anything goes. It's usually something like $125 per person plus $400 in administration fees. Make sure your credit is up to par and you have 3.5 times the rent for the corporate owned buildings. For private owned you need first and last months rent and one months security. It made more sense for us to buy. That's a journey as well and we had to search for a decent honest lender.  If you have to get a car new is your best bet. Do not buy  an as is car anywhere in South Florida if you can help it. There are no lemon laws for used cars. We got a shoddy dealer but we were able to recoup our money because he violated federal laws. It was a process. Its best to avoid all together. Overall we love it here and feel it's worth staying. My health is better . I love to walk and everything has side walks even the suburbs.  I've found a great salsa community. If the things I mentioned aren't relative to you forgive me I don't know if you're male or female.

"Lived in Miami for a long time. Also visited LA and was instantly turned off by it. It felt dirty. Very dirty. Maybe it always hasn’t been this way, but I saw so much trash. Hollywood boulevard filled with homeless people, with literal syringes thrown on the floor. Miami has a homeless population, which is mostly situated in downtown. I felt like it was all over in LA. You’d be in a nice neighborhood in the Hills, and you walk 3 streets over and you’re in Grove Street from GTA San Andreas. Everywhere you’d turn you’d see these Home Depot tents. Apparently these folks can set up shop on the sidewalk directly in front of your home and there’s nothing you can do about it (someone correct me if I’m wrong). Food service in LA was absolutely trash. This can happen anywhere, and it’s happened to me in Miami as well, but it stood out to be that it was consistently bad. Overpriced food, orders taking forever, servers refusing to split a tab 2-3 ways, etc.

I think LA has better weather and more varied nature than Miami. Arguably California is one of the prettiest, if not the prettiest state. A shame that it’s turned into such a shithole, really.

"I think it comes down primarily to speaking Spanish.

If you speak Spanish, you’ll find many tribes of people to hang with. It’s very easy to make friends here over a shared culture. I found people were less open to friends in LA. It will also be frustrating when you can’t communicate with coworkers, colleagues, etc.

There are equally as many fun things to do in each city but again, most things in Miami revolve around Hispanic culture.

People in Miami are less educated and lazier which can be frustrating when dealing with customer service. LA blows it away.

The ocean here is fantastic but you may find yourself going to the beach less frequently than you think. It’s brutally hot most of the year, the traffic, bad driving, and parking make it a mission.

However, if you have the means to live on the beach or regularly take your boat out, this could give Miami a huge advantage. Obviously, this is really expensive.

So, while I choose Miami because of my people and the culture, I think LA is overall better.

"DO NOT MOVE TO MIAMI.

I have spent 7 years in Los Angeles, and I've grown up and lived/worked in Miami. I am currently living in Austin, TX. I will attempt to complete dissuade you from even considering Miami with the points below.

* For those claiming that this decision boils down to whether you like Mexican culture or Cuban culture more, I'd have to say you're wrong. While there is an obviously strong Mexican culture in Los Angeles, it is also open and honest about the fact that they're Mexicans in America, meaning they know that they'll be in communication, at some level, with people from different cultures, with English as the main communication language. The Mexican presence is also in existence amongst a strong Korean presence, Japanese presence, African-American presence, Caucasian American presence, and even an Ethiopian presence, with a smattering of other Asian communities. This means that if you like Mexican culture, you can CHOOSE to engage with it. Miami is different. The Cubans in Miami behave as if they are not in America and feel that you speaking their language is a requirement. I'll leave this point at that; I'd hate to come off offensively here, but those who've lived in Miami and are not part of the Hispanic community know exactly what I'm talking about.
* Second point, I'll start with a joke: You know what the best part of Miami is? It's how close it is to America. Miami is not an American city. Period. Anyone who thinks Miami is an American city has never spent meaningful time in an American city. This is why all attempts to transform this city, to make it a leader in Tech, or to bring infrastructure and organization to the level of other cities, will always fail.
* This might be the most important point I can make: never discount the effect that a populace with a low IQ will have on you. The notion that you are the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with is cheesy, but imagine the effect of having a whole city that defaults to low IQ, low EQ, and a complete lack of desire to assimilate, will have on you. I have met people who have spent 19+ years in Miami and CHOSE not to speak English. Think clearly about all the immigrants in other parts of the country (Polish, Ukrainian, Nigerian, Palestinian, take your pick) who've made it a goal to learn and speak English, and contrast that with the complete lack of desire amongst Hispanics to accept that they are, in fact, in America. This city will pull you down to its level, and once you rise above it (by leaving), you'll realize how alien this city really is.
* This point will bridge the previous point and the next point: this is a scam city. It's built on scams. That's how people get by: scamming. I'll leave this point at that.
* Your career will advance more if you're in another city. Because other cities are American, and the knowledge, experience, company name will help you transfer. There's no real opportunity here; it's to be had in other places. Skip it all, and just go to the other places. Think about it, deeply. Imagine you're in Detroit, working as a VP of a division of a $400MM+ company. You have a management position open, and three candidates have applied: one from Seattle, one from New York, and one from Miami. Check your gut. Are you really, truly expecting the one from Miami to be as worldly, as intelligent, to act with decorum, to be able to lead a mature team, etc.? As someone who has lived in many places, traveled, interacted with and befriended people from all over, I can tell you comfortably that I would, at a gut level, discount the Miami candidate.

A long-winded way of saying, don't move to Miami. Just. Don't.",t2_jpr6e,sparrowacct86,1,1648998696.0,0,t1_i38bq4q,i38bq4q,True,Marifreakinganneeats,t3_tv5ai0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/tv5ai0/miami_vs_los_angeles/,Miami vs Los Angeles,/r/Miami/comments/tv5ai0/miami_vs_los_angeles/i38bq4q/,1,r/Miami,0,1

"Here is the thing that makes LA great and it is not talked about here. 

LA is a four hour drive away from every type of nature and terrain. You want to ski in the Winter it's 4 hours away. You want the Ocean or a Lake, it's there.

Plus you can drive to Mexico, Vegas, San Francisco, and vacation there.

In all honesty, our jobs moved us to Miami & our money goes 10 times further in Miami than LA. And get used to no true amazing Mexican food restaurants in Miami.

"So I grew up in LA and moved to Miami 9 yrs ago. At first I hated Miami, but with time and everyone moving here, it wasn’t so bad. LA is amazing, has beaches to surf, beautiful sunsets by the coast, excellent weather with seasons, educated people, mountains, desserts, wineries, Mexico nearby, etc, etc. Miami doesn’t have all that, but has great water sports, always something to do, restaurants to try… if you live close to downtown, everything is close and u can uber to most places. You have the keys too and nice beaches everywhere, literally without fail. It’s a melting pot of cultures, with Latins dominating. If you cant embrace Spanish + Caribbean and South American culture, don’t move here. My favorite part about Miami is its connectivity to international travel. You can be in Europe in 8-9hrs, Mexico in 1.5hs, the Caribbean and Latin America in 2-3hrs. All non-stop flights. Planning vacations here is way more exciting than LA because it’s also wayyy cheaper. I’ve gone to Mexico and Latin America for the weekend many times. I love to travel so that’s a huge plus for me personally. Also, buying real estate and things like that are more achievable in FL than CA. But keep in mind all of this is taking into account you make a decent salary of at least $80k and work remote or near the office. If you’re gonna be broke, Miami sucks just like LA. Also, dating here sucks too, pretty sure LA is the same tho. But from my POV, ppl here are way more fake bc everyone is beautiful and they’re looking for the next best thing. You will see tons of sugar daddies and gold diggers. The party scene in Miami is INTENSE. I’ve always thought of Miami Beach as Vegas on the beach (without the casinos). I never go clubbing anymore, that’s for the tourists. Last thing, tons of republicans. So you may run into someone who doesn’t believe in birth control, and you will need to agree to disagree.

if you like the heat, sun sweating while running errands miami 

LA better weather 

many different nice  beach options there’s not only miami and south beach but lots of other more “calmer” beaches at a reasonable distance 

orlando as well is about 3-4 hour ride beautiful springs

it depends what part of miami you stay in but lots more Spanish speakers here vs in LA

People in LA are more well mannered/respectful 
better customer service everywhere, there are some nice people down here tho! you have your good and bad everywhere (i see this miami attitude as ppl have a NY attitude)

although i will say I find people here to be more “real” lots of fake superficial people in LA

traffic hmm what can I saw Traffic in LA is horrid but I feel more safe in LA. in miami it is a traumatic driving experience every time you step out. Worst driving I have seen people do not respect driving laws here. 

Miami always a party somewhere, everywhere you go even during the day you here spanish music blasting 

I don’t party much, there’s camping trails here, beaches and usually other stuff to do museums exhibits 

although i feel in LA there is as well 

Food, I find food in Miami to be cheaper. 

better and more mexican options in LA 

in miami to get good mexican food you have to really look for it, you can find a couple spots or go to Homestead 30/45 minute drive 

LA is definitely a more laid back type Vibe, I find it is hard for LA people to get used to the Miami life.

I would agree it’s small number but we are discussing LA vs Miami. Hurricanes Irma wasn’t even a direct hit on Miami and it caused $4.5 mil I’d damages. So it’s a viable argument about considering living in Miami. It will also cost you on the insurance for your property. So you may not had any damage from Irma but if you own a property your paying for the damage it caused because premium keep going up bud to the threat of a hurricane.,t2_4e67mv8n,TriggerBroke,0,1648992979.0,0,t1_i37zne6,i37zne6,False,Marifreakinganneeats,t3_tv5ai0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/tv5ai0/miami_vs_los_angeles/,Miami vs Los Angeles,/r/Miami/comments/tv5ai0/miami_vs_los_angeles/i37zne6/,1,r/Miami,0,1

"I get it bro. I’m done with renovations for the sake of renovations unless of course it’s something I can do myself or something breaks and needs replacing. It’s just not worth it to pay someone simply to make something “nicer” when they’re just gonna fuck it up anyways. It’s one thing to look at my own handy work and find flaws. I can live with that. It’s another thing to have paid someone for flawed work. Ostensibly, paying someone to fuck you.

Also, the idea that home improvement projects help your resale value doesn’t apply in Miami. No matter what you’ve done to your house the next person who buys it will just gut it anyways. It’s what everyone does. No one in Miami just buys a house and moves in. Realtors know this and they will price your house accordingly. You don’t get any credit for that $15k bathroom of yours because it will get torn out. Everyone in Miami requires the latest and greatest…but hey atleast you got to shit in a nice room.

Who said it was devastating? I was replying to you saying that Irma had little no damage in South Florida. I lost about a $1000 in food (due to power outage) and had to replace my fence which was about $9000. I also worked with Miami-Dade County cleaning up the city in the aftermath. I took Miami-Dade county about 3 months to clean up all the debris from Irma. There was about $4.5 million in damages in Miami-Dade. So not sure where you got you’re figures about of little to no damage with Irma.

"I have. Lived in Burbank, worked in Downtown and Hollywood (also lived in San Francisco, but Norcal doesn't count).

Even with LA's homelessness problem, LA's actually got a modicum of public services to cope with it, unlike the almost nothing we have in Miami.

Next, wages in LA are generally quite a bit higher than in Miami.  If you plan on working in Miami, expect lower wages; and if you plan to work remotely with an LA salary, expect half of Miami to hate you because you're part of the reason that housing prices have shot up exponentially here in the last year.

"Why people calling it ""Don't Say Gay"" bill when this title was literally given by critics of the bill, it other words this title was given by LGBTQ activists to spread misinformation about the bill and obviously to get a rise out of people with fake details.

The entire point of the bill is to not allow teachers that teach between Kindergarten to 3rd grade students, to talk about gender topics and sexuality.

Honestly, it is up to the parent to talk to their kids about gender and sexuality especially for such young ages and I don't think it's a school teacher's job to teach our kids about the ""birds & the bees"".

Kids between ages of Kindergarten and 3rd grade soak up information like a spunge and should be allowed to be kids and grow up on their own without anyone in a school trying to brainwash them into believing certain gender ideology. Kids as they grow, mature, and age will eventually figure out themselves how they want their lives to be. We all do.

This Parental Rights law is correct and I hope it stands.

ALSO, we should ALL judge people on the content of ones character and THIS is what we as parents should be teaching our kids. To treat others like we want them to treat us and NOT focus on gender, race, sex, religion.

"Because I have read and seen cases that are similar to hers.    She's not an animal that was captive for less than 5 years. She has been captive for her whole life which is 50. 

I'd say you should consider reading more about these things.   You aren't analyzing, and that's where the issue lies where I see the failure in some people that don't like to admit that there is such a thing as a time frame.

No one is saying that if she were another whale, a younger one, with far less captive years she'd have issues.  She more than likely wouldn't. But her current age, which by the way is no spring chicken for whales and her current length of years in captivity does. Use logic.  

Why do you think experts have changed HOW they train animals to go back into the wild? it's not because they are geniuses, it is because they have seen past experiences which have taught them where their previous failure points are.  Trial and error. 

They release her at this stage, heck they actually try to move her to another state and she will more than likely die in transit.  This has already been indicated by individuals that have more years in university to study these animals and their anatomy than YOU or I.

"I had this experience. You can book the appt two weeks out. But the date to go has to be 72 hours before you travel. I could make an appt in Miami for those three days, so I made an appt in Louisiana, the next closest passport agency. I called everyday to try to get an appt in Miami. The day before I was going to fly to Louisiana (in the 72 hour window before travel), I got an appt in Miami. 

I went to the agency at 6:30 am, they had it printed by 12:30. Make sure you have the proper documents. If you already have a passport that has expired, you don’t need much other proof of ID.

"Three years ago, I went to the airport to get on a plane and found out my passport was expired (Yup, I didn’t check). I got an appointment for the very next day at the Omni office. Booked via phone. I arrived at 4:30am to make sure I was first in line. I got my new passport at 5pm. Made my new flight with just minutes to spare.

FYI: Since everyone there getting a passport is in freak out mode due to a last-minute emergency, the employees have to deal with a lot of shit. Consequently, they are complete Nazis. The guards are worse. Don’t even think about taking any cellphone pics in there. And if you so much as use the wrong tone of voice, those guards will come and breath down your neck. I didn’t have any problem, but I saw it happen to others. The main guard in charge is a total dictator. He’s constantly shouting at people, “This is a federal facility!

"- High cost of living for average value

- Low wages, competitive job market and limited professional/career opportunities compared to other cities

- Highly superficial culture and people

- Dating sucks and the social scene all revolves around money and status

- People get sucked into the superficial lifestyle too easily and expect you to do the same in order to fit in

- Oppressive heat, humidity, rains and hurricanes during June thru October

- Shady business culture, expected unreliability from people, unprofessionalism, rudeness and flat out disrespect

">It's not irrelevant, you implied that puberty at 8 or 9 is a relevant enough figure to dispute my statement that around 13 is when people consider puberty happening.

Yea so mentioning 5/6 years old is irrelevant. My link states that it begins between 8-13 and boys and 9-11 in girls - your statement about ""around 13"" isn't backed by any facts.

"Thanks man. I’ve learned my lesson but I wasn’t even really referring to the pricing. I’m talking about shoddy workmanship, contractors cutting corners to increase their margins, or just outright lying about what work is needed. 

I could go on and on. I’ll give you one example of many. My mom had a washing machine that was broken and still under warranty. Local contractor comes out and insists the tub itself and a spin pulley needs to be replaced. He orders the replacement parts. The washing machine is out of service for a couple of weeks. A new guy shows up and he examines the washing machine and tells us it’s just a matter of swapping out a belt. Turns out  the other guy had been ordering needless parts so he could sell them on the side. 

This is the type of shit I’m talking about. It’s typical Miami shit and most people don’t see anything wrong with it. It’s criminal but most people just think of it as a side hustle. 

If we’re being honest with ourselves no one in Miami is more that 1 or 2 degrees of separation away from a criminal syndicate…and we think that’s normal. This place is an irredeemable cess pool.

"The issue is that this wasn’t a problem to begin with. It’s very clear that this bill was purely conceived and written vaguely enough in order to basically allow schools to silence lgbtq+ students or students with lgbtq+ families because it makes some bigotted parents uncomfortable. 

It’s never been an issue when second grader Tommy has a crush on second grader Stacy. But let’s say second grader Tommy has a crush on second grader Ricky…

Now Tommy starts telling his friends he has a crush on Ricky and it’s all innocent. 

The teacher has to shut that down and tell his parents even if the teacher knows his parents are diehard zealots that hate the gays. 

The language is left vague enough in order to allow for this. When this was never an issue to begin with and would invalidate this kid’s identity at an early age. 

Same thing if say Stacy had two dads and started speaking about that and Courtney next to her asks the teacher if kids can actually have two dads. Again, this bill is “solving” an issue that wasn’t there to begin with. 

It’s as if we proposed a bill saying: all students are no longer allowed to wear black because black is not an appropriate color for children. 

You’re solving a problem that never existed, and now just creating issues and making things complicated. Now people have to figure out if all their clothes qualify as black or not. 

“Is X piece of clothing dark gray or is it black? Is this Navy or black? Do socks count? Does jewelry count? What if the pattern has black in it? What if I have predominantly white shoes but the stitching is black? Can I get in trouble for that? The bill is so vague…”

"The traffic is frustrating, but **not too bad**. Considering the f\*ckng bridges downtown flapping like a bird all day and the fact that Brickell was a swamp with 1 interstate off ramp few years ago, it really could be worse. What is annoying is that people are slow and inconsiderate cunts with a tunnel vision. If you ever drove in a latin american country, it's a very similar feel.

If someone doesn't know what to do on a road / intersection / parking, they'll just stop, almost like their CPU overloads and they need a restart.

Also (these apply to central downtown): 

* cost of reno permits
* lack of decent bike paths
* all the DYI/electronics/furniture stores are far away
* lack of decent contractors (or 12-month waiting list)
* under-collateralized HOAs (be prepared for 30 down minimum)
* general ~~stup~~incapability (you'll be getting a deer in headlights look all the time)
* many modern high rises cut costs like crazy, i.e. not enough elevators, ramps, etc.

"Yes... You understand the preplanned talking point perfectly.   Well done.

If you think ""Florida"" politicized the issue .. you are well and truly played.  

That was always the plan.  Push until someone pushes back.... Then call them a bigot and say they are politicizing the issue.    

It boggles the mind that this works.   The level of cognitive dissonance required is astonishing.    

The first time I personally saw one of these and understood it was way back in the early 90s.    The Clinton administration said they were going to shut the government down and blame it on the Republican Congress.    Peter Jennings told me so.   Dan rather told me so.   

2 weeks later, the Clinton administration ""shut down"" the government.   And they said the Republicans in Congress shut the government down.   Peter Jennings said the Republicans in Congress shut the government down.   Dan rather said the Republicans in Congress shut the government down.   

I was stunned.   Dude!   You *personally* told me this was the white house strategy just 14 days ago.   Can you really not remember what you said 2 weeks ago?

I still vacillate between the cynical view that Peter Jennings was a willing accomplice, lying through his teeth to help his political allies, and the perhaps more disturbing view that Peter Jennings truly believed the lie, even though he was in on it from the beginning ... Through some odd groupthink social effect.   

And here we are again.  I have lived through dozens of iterations of this game.   People on each team pretend that the propaganda is reality.... So people like you pretend that none of the initial push ever existed.   Nobody said boys have to be allowed in the girls restroom.  Nobody ever put books with illustrations of explicit sex acts in elementary school libraries.   Nobody ever denied a girl a chance at a fair competition by switching genders....   None of that exists, and out of thin air, evil politicians conjur a hateful bill that makes even saying the word gay illegal.   

And of course team players on the other side cannot acknowledge that there are difficult realities for people who live outside the lines that society has created.    Where does an athletic young trans woman go to compete?   If she was a good athlete before transitioning, she is probably going to face a difficult situation, having large physical advantages.   Suddenly we have competing interests and rights.   Nobody likes to acknowledge that. .. so they engage characatures instead.   It is much easier to defeat a hateful strawman than it is to see both sides of what may be an insoluble problem.

I totally get Lea Thompson.   If I was in her situation, I would absolutely want to continue competing and trying to win races as my authentic self.  

I also totally empathize with Brooke Forde, who would have been the NCAA champion, but for a competitor who spent her entire career growing with a man's testosterone and body plan.  (If someone born female had been taking that amount of testosterone as a supplement all through high school and half of college, she would have been permanently banned from the sport)  If I were her, I would not see that as fair competition.   

I have no idea how to resolve those competing interests.  

But I do know that neither side seems all that willing to acknowledge that there are competing interests.... Which is how you know that people are being disingenuous and pushing wedge issues instead of actually caring about helping make the world a better place.",t2_qzeus27,pompanoJ,0,1648823820.0,0,t1_i2zl0r3,i2zl0r3,False,x_von_doom,t3_ttfmyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ttfmyl/and_here_we_gofirst_court_challenge_to_dont_say/,…and here we go…first court challenge to “Don’t Say Gay” bill is filed.

"Corruption is so pervasive here because it's just part of everyday life in the countries many have moved here from. Big corruption, and everyday small corruption.

I'm an optimistic person but it feels like the starting point of decision making for most people here is 'let me see how much I can get away with/how many rules I can get around' rather than 'what is the correct/right way to proceed'.

"The ""good weather"" is completely overrated, unless you don't need to work and can spend every day near the water. It's nice in the daytime from December through parts of March, otherwise it is way too hot. If it weren't too hot, you'd see way more people walking to work, and way more people with their car windows down instead of up with the air conditioning on. At home, most people run their AC 365 days a year. Because otherwise, yes, it is too hot and uncomfortable in the home. A crisp, cool 60 degree day happens maybe 10-15 times a year.

Traffic is an obvious problem, but the root is that there is no viable alternative, and there never will be. The government (and ultimately with agreement of a majority of the citizens) put most transport funds into car infrastructure, which is a complete waste. No matter how many improvements are made to the highways, there will always be the same amount of traffic. Public transport is mostly worthless unless you happen to live near the one line, and biking in most areas of the county is just too dangerous, due to, as mentioned elsewhere, a low educated and completely self-absorbed population.

"When you were in school at that age Obergefell hadn’t been decided and you probably didn’t have a couple of kids in your class with 2 dads or 2 moms. 

Now this is pretty normal since every kid below second grade was born while gay marriage was already legal. 

An example:

The teacher asks the class what they did this weekend and Timmy says “I went to Disney with my Dads”

Sally asks: “Why does Timmy have Dads”

The teacher can’t answer that question and the answer doesn’t have anything to do with sex ed, the answer is “Because Timmy’s Dads love each other and love Timmy just like you your mom and dad love each other and love you”

Under this bill, the teacher has to answer with “go ask your parents” leaving all the kids thinking that Timmy’s parents are doing something bad and making Timmy feel bad about himself and his parents. 

DeSantis wants you to think this bill is only about sex. Sexual orientation and gender identity is about a lot more than just sex. Kids at all ages are seeing same-sex couples everywhere because it’s becoming pretty common-place and banning that from classrooms is just bigotry.",t2_9kr02,figuren9ne,0,1648810755.0,0,t1_i2yv4x4,i2yv4x4,False,x_von_doom,t3_ttfmyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/ttfmyl/and_here_we_gofirst_court_challenge_to_dont_say/,…and here we go…first court challenge to “Don’t Say Gay” bill is filed.
