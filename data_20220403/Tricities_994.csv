I signed up and my first time through I left with soapy water streaks all over my car. The two guys drying I thought did an amazing job. But when I got home water had leaked out of who knows where and caused soap streaks. Do you have this issue? I am hoping it was a one time thing. But my husband went the day before and his truck has the same thing. Mine is more noticeable as it’s a darker Vehicle. I feel like their air dryer at the end isn’t strong enough?

"I can see the logic you’re presenting, but failing to wear a mask is how covid spreads. That means that going maskless is putting other people at risk, and we don’t tolerate personal choice when it puts other people at risk (see: drunk driving). Even though most people at any given moment aren’t covid positive and can’t give covid to anyone, the disease only gets around because it keeps finding new hosts; the unmasked make up the majority of fresh hosts. 

The counter-point to what I’ve written is that wearing a mask doesn’t completely stop covid, and not wearing a mask doesn’t always spread covid. Some people are okay wearing a mask even if it means *only maybe* means they’re saving a life, other people aren’t willing to do that. 

My personal opinion is that anyone who wouldn’t wear a mask was a sissy who couldn’t be bothered to lift a finger to help their country, but, the cats out of the bag at this point. We’ve tribalized and emotionalized covid to the point where facts aren’t getting through to anyone anymore, and we need to get back to being a nation.

"Playlive in the mall is your best bet locally for organized play. I’ve had varied experiences there but when it’s the only option you just deal with it. 

Adventures Underground doesn’t host any organized events as far as I know. Last time I asked they were pretty adamant they did NOT want to host MTG events. 

Annnnd that’s it. I’m amazed another LGS hasn’t popped up to fill the void Beta left a few years ago. You might try the store in walla walla ( I remember a place called Paladin I think? Looks like they’re gone). 

Hermiston has a decent MTG scene and Tolarian TableTop has been pretty active in running more events and generating interest on Facebook.

"Well, about 20 years ago (gather round, kids, when Altavista was the premier search engine), I knew a few people attending there and taking a Spanish class.  The assignment was to translate a paragraph from English to Spanish.  So, naturally, half the class took the paragraph, fed it to babelfish, didn't bother to clean it up, and just turned in the machine-translated paragraph.  The teacher sees that half the class did the *exact same* horrible job, and gave them all F's for the paper.

Naturally, the parents sided with the teacher and the principles of academic honesty.  Oh, haha, wait, no, they raised hell with the administration, and the admins made the teacher allow the kids another crack at the paper.

Beyond that, and then more than a couple kids told me that you had to have a good home life, or you could be booted.  I knew one whose parents were going through a VERY rough patch, and a major concern of his was that if his parents divorced, he'd be booted from school, since such a sinful situation at home wasn't acceptable.

They were also fairly ignorant to the sciences, compared to what was taught at all the public schools.  Most of the time, I saw families sending their kids there because they wanted their kids sheltered from the horrors of public school.  Rather hilarious (or hypocritical) when they're called to be a light to the world.

Maybe its better now, but I wouldn't bother spending the thousands to find out.

"> a nuclear superpower with ICBMs that are very much still functional.

I wouldn't be so sure.  Given the state of disrepair in their tanks, apc's, etc, I'm not confident that maintenance has been done on their ICBMs.  We've seen the results of 25 years (or more, depending which source you're looking at) of their leadership siphoning funds meant for maintenance, or stripping parts to sell or cannibalize for maintenance on other systems.

There's a reason that Ukrainians have found MREs with expirations 2015 or before, or even equipped with mere sugar packets for sustenance, on captured/killed Russian soldiers.  It costs our government $30 billion per year to maintain our nuclear arsenal.  I'm not even close to confident that Putin's Russia has allocated the funds, and even less so that those funds that were allocated actually were used as intended.

Beyond this, the Russian educational system really fell apart after 1989, and was hobbling in 1985.  This means that their last formally trained technicians and/or scientists would have graduated around 32 years ago, and would be in their low 50s now, with the rest hitting retirement age, or death, as their male life expectancy seems to float in the high 50s to low 60s.

So you have a country that is a shell of its former self, prior to the Ukrainian invasion had a GDP about that of Italy's, a kleptocractic government, and a rapidly aging technical force to maintain those systems.  It's entirely in the realm of possibility that their arms have degraded to the potency of those of North Korea, or less.",t2_ebm3r3f9,xertshurts,0,1648576727.0,0,t1_i2ld8y7,i2ld8y7,False,ManOfSandwich,t3_tqrr1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tqrr1y/got_a_job_onsite_at_the_hanford_nuclear_power/,"Got a job on-site at the Hanford nuclear power plant.

"If it's like the plant where I used to work, you'll be fine.

The following is extremely simplified and it's been a decade, but...

We used a unit of dose called ""Mrem"". The ""whole body"" federal limit is 5000mrem for a year. Our company's limit was 1000mrem for the year. At 500mrem you were placed on a special monitoring program. The most I ever got in a year, as a power plant operator who went in the controlled area almost every work day for 10 years, was 200mrem.

Since it's recent, that Chernobyl miniseries mentioned 3.6 Roentgen/hour, which for this discussion can be considered equivalent to Rem. This means their ""daily use"" meter topped out at 3600 mrem each hour. So my worst case would take 18 years to match what that could read each hour.

Now, I did go with in areas with a lot of radiation, higher than 200mrem/hr. But my dose never got that high. Why? We focused on ""time distance shielding"" which if you go to training you'll hear quite often. Minimize the time you're there, work as far away from high dose areas as you can, and use shielding to keep from taking more dose 

There are different levels of training depending on what you'll be doing there. If you never go in the ""controlled area"" it will be very basic. The more work you do the more specific it will get. Generally, observe posted signs and boundaries and you'll be okay. If you have any questions, stop what you're doing, put your work in a safe condition, and go back for clarification. Those are the most important things.

"So far so good with RSD here.  We know a few admins and teachers.  In spite of the loonies on the board, you gotta remember that the staff are people that got into education for a reason, and who is on the board doesn't change that, just makes their jobs a little tougher at times.

We moved back here mid school year last year, absolutely no problems, though we didn't try to register outside the school's footprint.  Things can get dicier if you do that as I recall (I grew up here).

I'd question the reviews.  Where we're at now, it gets docked points for a lack of diversity, but we've been in *very* diverse schools in the Seattle area, and that really wasn't the strength they liked to portray it as.  The mere presence of a certain race doesn't make a school better or worse.

If you're going private, Catholic schools are usually good, Tri-Cities Prep was good 20 years ago, Liberty Christian was an academic joke (and moral one) 20 years back. Can't speak to how they are now.  That said, I graduated in KSD, and my HS education was certainly on par with any from a private school here.

"I moved from Bellingham to Tri-Cities 7 years ago. Bellingham was rainy all the time, with mold always a constant threat (apartment living).

Now they are on monthly allergy meds - Tri-Cities is in the Columbia Basin so everything settles here. My skin has dried out, my dogs have dried out. My wife loves it because she grew up around evergreens and enjoys the yearly sunshine. I am Ginger and hate the sun so it is challenging.  It used to be a lot cheaper here to live but now everyone is moving here so prices are rising, but still cheaper than West side obviously.  VERY conservative area - lots of White Mormons and Hispanic Catholics.  Some gang issues (not as much as 15 years ago from what I understand).

"Top in Cuisine Type

1) Burger Ranch in Kennewick, Vineyard Drive. Fat burgers, fat portion of fries. So many options to choose from as well and the beef actually tastes delicious!
2) Sawadee Thai for their orange chicken. Skip Panda and try them out next time! Sushi award goes to Sushi Nori and their Godzilla Roll. Tokyo Sushi & Teriyaki and Red Bento deserve their honorable mentions. Different restaurants for Asian cuisine is important, not all of them are equal!
3) Mexico Lindo y Que Rico for big plates. If you want tacos, Tacos Colima in Kennewick are epic. For Pasco, Tacos El Jefe is new and surprisingly very good although a bit pricey. For Richland, the Wild Taco. My friend's dad owns it and I never had it before she gave me food.
4) For all American, Texas Roadhouse blows em all out of the water. Want ribs? Their BBQ Ribs will tear apart from their bone and taste so good you will want another set. Ribeye? You better get ready to pay up but it's absolutely worth it. Chicken fried steak? It's my favorite! Their prices aren't horrible either unless you decide to buy steaks for everyone which is not cheap. Their wings are amazing as well. Rattlesnake Bites and loaded potato wedges. And did I almost forget the addictive rolls with cinnamon butter. 😛
5) Last but not least, my addiction. The holy grail of my belly. I won't eat all day just waiting to chomp this monstrosity down. Brother's Cheesesteaks. Savory ribeye steak, scrumptious caramelized onions, soft mushrooms, exquisite bell peppers, topped with cheese whiz, provolone and their signature sauce. I present to you, the Steak Melt.

"The biggest adjustment has been finding new things to do. Every place has its ups and downs, and you have to seek out the unique opportunities the area has available.

The biggest positive surprise is how much I actually love the weather. Spring is absolutely amazing. And the intense summer heat is perfect for playing on the water. If you have access to a pool, a boat, or frequent the river beaches then a 95-degree day is just about right.

The biggest negative surprise is the freaking wind. You will want to consider that when looking for a neighborhood. For example, there are lots of nice homes being built up on Badger Mountain but you won't be able to have patio furniture or leave anything outside without it blowing away. It's also going to be brutal in the big new neighborhood being built on the south side of Badger Mountain.

"Moved here from the west side in August:
Adjustments
1. Humidity: dry heat and dry cold (freezing) feel different than west side temps. My face hurt all winter and the heat in August was unbelievable. It also doesn’t cool off at night in the summer.
2. Allergies: so much pollen and airborne allergens! And all completely different than the west side.
3. Dehydration is a real thing here. Plan on making a noticeable change in how much water you drink and how many chapsticks you have around the house.
4. Politically neutral = liberal. Sooooo many Trump 2020/2024 supporters here
5. WIND

Surprises
1. Seasonal depression hit hard. No green, so cold, so grey and brown
2. Sprinklers: so much fun for the kids
3. Wineries/breweries: if you’re a wine or beer person, this is a great place to be
4. A/C: it costs a lot to cool down a house when it’s 95+ outside, but it’s worth it

"So for context on my bias, I grew up here, moved to Seattle for the better part of a decade, came back about a year ago.

Politically, I consider myself more towards the center on average, pragmatic fiscally, socially liberal.  Here I'm seen as the bleeding heart liberal because I want to fund the fuck out of schools and pre-k education, nutrition programs for kids, etc.  Over in Seattle I was called a Trumper more than once due to thinking that people camping on the sidewalks, shitting on the sidewalks, leaving needles everywhere, etc, was not the ideal scenario.  Crazy, I know.

Here it's just strange politically.  We have the Q-Anon crowd that thinks their crazy stuff, the Trump loyalists who are still flying their flags (I never cared to share that sort of stuff publicly, seems weird at best), and the recent mess with anti-vax/masking and the Richland schools.  Of course, in Seattle, seeing people wearing masks outside is just bizarre too.  Maybe it's best to say that where Seattle's cranking the wheel hard left instead of a measured response to whatever thing is going on, TC cranks it hard right, though there is a vocal minority community, such as those seeking to get the Byirds recalled, so it's not like you're the one person alone here.

Biggest adjustment was I finally felt home again.  Not just because I grew up here, but because people outwardly act normal.  In Seattle, you don't really meet your neighbors.  Here, I knew them all within a week, kid was playing with the rest of the kids in the neighborhood, and all that.  Also, you can leave you car unlocked at night and it's not been ransacked (not every neighborhood, but in even the nicest areas in Seattle, you hide and lock your stuff like there's a meth addict on every corner, or your stuff is gone in the morning).  Beyond that, the idiocy is predictable, and just explained by no bullshit filter, in that they just can't discern reality from fiction, but ok.  Seattle, I still can't fathom why the school district would prevent principals from calling the cops to evict tent camps from their playgrounds.

After that, you have to get used to very little traffic.  People here bitch about it, and that's so cute.  Oh, you took an extra 5 minutes getting home?  At least it's not an hour to go 2 miles, or a 90 minute commute each way, every day.  Sure, we don't have a lot of A-list bands or shows coming here, but I'm not really worried about that.  The fishing and hunting is off the charts compared to the west side.  The roads aren't crammed in, where you're riding both the left and right side lines.  You can ride your bike around your neighborhood, and they have ample space for you and the cars driving, there are sidewalks most everywhere, and people aren't doing 50 mph around blind corners.  

The schools are much better as well, or at least the consistency is there.  At the old one, my kid was ahead of the curve, so they didn't teach her much of anything for the year, we had to augment her education to keep her up to what we thought standards should be.  The last teacher over there actually asked us not to do this, but here, teachers seem to support the parents as much as the parents should be supporting the teachers.  Beyond this, if there's a second language spoken at home for the students, it's just about always spanish, so resources are easy for them, and it won't detract from schooling the kids proficient in english.  Last place had multiple languages spoken at home (english, spanish, somali, arabic, hindi (though indians magically value education and learning the native tongue, weird, I know)), so that was disruptive as well.

No real surprises, other than the insane growth in our absence.  This place is rapidly expanding, no other way to describe it.  Areas I thought wouldn't see development for 25 years are built over, such as south of I-82 in Kennewick.  Real Estate is *much* more expensive than a decade ago, but still half or less than what you'd pay in Seattle, and you get way more bang for the buck.  Negative surprise was that my favorite taco truck went away.  If you're a huge sushi/asian food fan, Seattle is better.  If you like mexican food, this place blows the west side out of the water.  Anyone over there arguing otherwise doesn't know their ass from a hole in the ground.

Regarding the other parts about race, I can't comment on asian experiences firsthand, but having grown up here, and seeing what it's like with my kids, my observations were a bit different, in that yeah, kids/people would see the skin tones or whatever, but beyond that, nobody really cared.  Here if you are pointing someone out in a crowd, you'd say white/mexican as freely as you'd say blond/brown hair.  It's not bad, it's a fact, it doesn't matter, but it is an easy way to play the where's waldo game.  There, I said something along those lines, and the looks were amazing.  I had to pretend that people were clear, which struck me as just bizarre. I'm sure there's white folks afraid of downtown Pasco, but going there, there are plenty of white folks walking around too, so I think that's just when you get to the wrong pockets of town, or the Matlock generation.  A strong mexican presence is one thing I dearly missed about this place, but I'm probably 30% adobada by weight, so I'm a bit biased.

You'll probably drive more, though biking is a lot more accessible than it was 20 years ago.  The weather is *much* better, allowing for more outdoor activities.  The constant September-May drizzle doesn't exist.  It actually freezes in winter which is nice, I prefer 25 and dry or snow to 40 and wet.

If your kid is a teen, they'll complain how boring it is.  Of course, I heard similar from people that grew up in the cities, so I think that's just endemic to the human experience at that age.  It's a great place to raise kids though, much better than Seattle, would definitely recommend it for what you share of your family's situation.",t2_ebm3r3f9,xertshurts,0,1648052975.0,0,t1_i1tag0m,i1tag0m,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1tag0m/,4,r/TriCitiesWA,0,4

"I've heard Tri Cities described as ""the Florida of Washington"" and it fits beautifully.

The right wing political mania has really flourished out here, especially since 2016. It has gotten to the point that even something as mundane as the local school board meetings (at least in Richland, most notably) have turned into something akin to watching Tucker Carlson. Instead of doing their job, some of the new Trump-era members use it as a battleground for waging the far right culture wars. Just google Richland Washington school board and you'll see articles about how utterly dysfunctional it has become. And the sad/scary thing is, this dysfunction is widely supported and popular out here, and I only expect it to get worse with more wackos elected into office in the coming years.

And along with the right wing prevalence comes the aggressive ""God / guns / get-off-my-lawnism"" that you would expect.

You'd probably see the same dynamics in any rural area these days.

But other than the Don't Tread on Me political extremism that's taking over, it's a pretty nice place to live!

"As a native, sorry you had a feeling of otherness! It’s not hard to imagine why, unfortunately. 

I wanted to add for the benefit of other commenters that Franklin county is 51% Hispanic (that would be outside Kadlec territory). The idea that Pasco (one of the Tri-Cities and the main town in Franklin country) is outside of acceptable areas is why people think the tri cities is very white. It’s not, it’s just very segregated. 

Last year Benton County’s murder rate was about the national average and a bit higher than Franklin county’s. Pasco isn’t dangerous, but bigotry is a real thing and a lot of people think Pasco is dangerous. If you’re in the Tri-Cities do yourself a favor and check out Viera’s bakery, Mexico Lindo restaurant, the historical museum, or the farmers market.

Best way to describe it is comfortable but boring.

3: Top 3 must experience restaurants.

"Ok, caveat that it has been 14 years....

Mixed family (Asian and Caucasian), moved here with one kid now at three.

Biggest adjustment was the highs of the summer heat, not terrible but not normal for people from Seattle either.   The biggest learning curve was figuring out how to operate an irrigation system which I never had to deal with on the westside. :D

I don't know what we were expecting, but really haven't had any issues.  Food might be one, our regular trips back to Seattle include mandatory trips to Uwajimaya and Trader Joe's.  The local Asian stores tend more toward Thai type products probably because of an influx of Burmese refugees in the early 2000s.  There is also a somewhat decent sized Filipino population that has a dedicated market.

The public schools are what you make of them.  We live in one of the poorest areas in Kennewick and have been pleasantly surprised by the schools.  By every testing rating the elementary we are at is terrible, but  that number is impacted by the high percentage of first generation immigrants, if your parents don't speak English it is unsurprisingly tough to catch up education wise.  Our kids have been challenged to learn and our youngest will have the opportunity for dual language learning when he starts kindergarten next year.

I really like the mix of rural and urban, having real Farmer's Markets from local growers is great.  I like my kids being able to see their food being grown.  The outdoor opportunity is great for fishing and ok for hunting, depending on what you hunt for.  Local hiking is somewhat limited, and it feels like getting to a hike/camp with trees around it is always 2 hours away, but the options are fairly amazing.  Heading into the Blues or down into eastern Oregon (the Eagle Caps are amazing) gets you into much less populated forests and wilderness areas compared to the Cascades and Olympics around Seattle.

"Asian here and moved to Tri-Cities for my fellowship at Kadlec in 2018 and moved back. I might have more similar life experience with you.

1) Biggest adjustment is the overall whiteness of the area. I grew up in the Oakland/Alameda, went to undergrad in SoCal and went to UW. All extremely multi-cultural compared to Western Washington. The whiteness stands out completely. There's the usual sense of undercurrent of racism that you'll feel. A patient asked me if I was ""that"" doctor on a magazine that was right next to me even if we didn't look anything unlike. There's definitely a ""We don't' go there"" about Pasco because of the heavy Latin population. There's a lack of culture here, especially in non-white cuisine. There's no real authentic Chinese restaurants and only one Pho place. The pho place doesn't have what I usually eat, like hock, tripe or anything. It's just super bland and watered down for the folks here. 

POCs in the community are pretty open with other POCs and drop their guard pretty quickly. I did some demographic data and it's pretty startling. In 2018,less than 2% of the population is black and less than 4% of the population is Asian in Kadlec's Service Area.  At my fellowship, a person I was doing an informational interview with, talked about the struggle as a WW and BM interracial couple and how it took a bit to get use too. We talked about 'that feeling of otherness"" you get when you walk around and the look the people gave you. It's not an overt, ""Fuck that guy"" but it's there.

2) I think the biggest surprise is how quickly I got around to places and how great the Latin food was. Considering how high my standard was (Oakland baby!), the Mexican/Oaxacan/Yucatan food was exceptional. And I'm not talking about the taco trucks. 

Biggest negative surprise, again, is the lack of culture. There's not much to do after 7 or 8pm other than dive bars.

3) I don't think I ever adjusted. I ended up eating at home more often. Drove back to Seattle every other weekend over my 5 month long fellowship. They offered me a job after my fellowship as a clinic manager, which I politely declined to stay in the organization at Renton.",t2_ebyag,purkour,0,1648007817.0,0,t1_i1r62r5,i1r62r5,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1r62r5/,8,r/TriCitiesWA,0,8
"Spent the first three decades of my life in western WA along the I-5 corridor (grew up in Kelso, college in Bellingham, ~10 years in the Kirkland area), and moved over here about 5 years ago.

I probably like the weather more here, as fall and spring aren't the 50%+ wet days that they are on the west side.  Politically, it's pretty conservative everywhere, and talking to friends on the west side still about how COVID is going, etc, is a bit eye opening.  And finally, the dining out options are much more limited, with alot more generic chain-style restaurants.  

In the end, I have been happy moving here, but that is in a large part due to getting a nicer house and me being fairly content being a homebody.  Having grandparents within 30 minutes is great too, as we never had that before.  The weather can sometimes be a bit rough, and the right wing dipshits that took over the Richland School Board drive me nuts, but I suppose it's made me more aware of other views and trying to have more conversations outside my bubble.",t2_3fmri,wildo88,0,1648007515.0,0,t1_i1r5j9e,i1r5j9e,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1r5j9e/,19,r/TriCitiesWA,0,19

"I've lived here most of my life. Lived in Seattle for a few years as well. I'll tell you that the most shocking thing for a number of people who have moved here from other places is two fold: 1) how early everything closes compared to more populous areas, and 2) the wind.


Number 1 doesn't bother me as I don't really go out at night and having lived here forever I'm used to it. However, coming from a more populous area like Seattle, I could see how that would be weird. Be prepared that on Sundays, not much beyond grocery stores are open after 6:00pm. On weekdays, restaurants and bars will stay open until 8:00 or 9:00 (sometimes longer maybe). On Friday and Saturday night, things will stay open until last call, but it's also not uncommon for places to close at 10:00 even if they have a bar. I used restaurants and bars as examples because in other places I've lived they're consistently the places open late at night beyond grocery stores...your mileage may vary. This is pretty much a bedroom community first and foremost. There is not a ton of night life and the entertainment scene is still up and coming (meaning what is here is generally popular and not large in quantity.)


Number 2 bothers me greatly. I've always hated the wind here. Depending on where in the TC you live, there is almost always at least a small breeze (which is pleasant), but it can quickly turn into a windy mess. When I was younger and there weren't so many houses we could get nasty dust storms in town as well as the surrounding areas. Thanks to the rapid growth here, the dust storms are far less frequent, but the wind remains. In the surrounding, more open areas, we've had on multiple occasions major crashes on interstates involving dozens of vehicles due to dust storms. The wind I refer to is 15+ mph sustained and 40+ mph gusts. While it doesn't happen all the time, it's enough that it irritates me. There's a joke here that it's always windy on garbage day. You'll find your trash can, plus a number of your neighbors' cans down the street every week.


As a bonus, my wife didn't develop allergies until we moved back here permanently in the mid 2000's. There are a lot of things to be allergic to here such as Russian Olive trees. The climate here surprises people usually - 300 days of sun with hot/dry summers and sometimes coldish snowy-ish winters (4 out of the last 5 or so have had a surprising amount of snow for this area.)


On the plus side, I moved away from here because I hated it as a kid. After graduating college and living on the east coast for a couple years, I realized that it's a great place to raise a family and moved back. The schools were/are decent and crime is relatively low (again, depending on where you live). There is a high concentration of college, graduate, and post-graduate degrees here and jobs to match. The Hanford site is one of, if not the largest employer in the area so the economy is usually pretty stable. Even during the 2008 housing crisis our home prices remained level or even ticked up slightly. Other large employers are starting to move here and create more variety of jobs and as a result the area is expanding pretty rapidly. There are outdoor things to do such as hunting, golf, hiking, camping, biking, boating, etc. in and around the area. The mountains are 1 to 2 hours away depending on what kind of mountains you're looking for.



With the exception of the fantasy places such as a beach in Hawaii or a cabin on a lake in a mountain forest, there aren't many other places I'd want to live. Being able to work remotely certainly opens up the options, but I haven't yet started searching for alternatives. If you can get past the fact that this area is a bedroom community first and foremost and are still interested then it'll be a good change.",t2_585qkgxj,BasilCraigens,0,1648005736.0,0,t1_i1r29it,i1r29it,True,northwesternsamurai,t3_tkjmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/,Can anybody share their experience of moving to the Tri-Cities from western WA?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tkjmxz/can_anybody_share_their_experience_of_moving_to/i1r29it/,30,r/TriCitiesWA,0,30

"I (36m), my wife (32f) and our kids moved from Seattle about 3.5 years ago. The biggest adjustment is the political mindset. Deeply conservative is the majority here.

It also gets extremely windy here which takes some getting used to. 

I loved the west side and am glad it is just a few hours away but I won't ever go back to live there.  I immediately began reaping the rewards of a much slower pace here, friendly/approachable neighbors and a different kind of beauty.

"I came from the far-far-far east of the US.

The intensity of the heat was shocking, even compared to having previously lived in inland mid-northern California.

The darkness in the winter was shocking, even having come from a very similar latitude.  The lack of snow and the pressure inversions make for a very very dreary winter.

The 100% suburb feel and the silly unplanned development corridors are ridiculous, but they are what they are.

It's weird being in a pretty far right area, having come from a pretty left one.  At least we're not Spokane Valley, though, electing Matt Shea.  I don't think we're quite so insane.

"1. West Richland or in that area they're building new neighbor hoods all the time. West Pasco as well. Stay out of East Pasco that's old and where all the crime is. Pasco generally isn't the most safe. There's reasons why their Walmart has to keep hard alcohol locked up while the Richland/Kennewick Walmart's leave their liquor out in the open. West Richland is old but it's starting to expand rapidly. With planned commercial fun all in the works.
2. It's a generally safe place to live but sometimes people do stupid things. Couple months ago there was a Drive-by shooting in Kennewick but it was someone from out of town and that's a rare instance. There's a lot of fun here despite what people say. More so perhaps before covid but there's still events and stuff to do and explore. We have a nice Fair every August and Hydroplane Races in July. There's plenty of hiking trails, golfing, cinemas, the Toyota Center gets some good shows and it's not too far of a drive for some big casinos or Silverwood in Idaho if you like rollercoasters.

The Myrtles Plantation: Murder, Mystery, and Magic –Documentary Feature – USA  
Director:  Ericka Boussarhane  
Running Time: 42:21m   
Website: https://www.secondsighttv.com/  

In St. Francisville, Louisiana lies the picturesque Myrtles Plantation. Situated 26 miles from Baton Rouge, it may not be the grandest of plantations, but what it lacks in presentation, it makes up for in disturbing history and lore. Owned by the Moss family, it’s touted as one of the most haunted places in America! Visitors have reported seeing apparitions, lights turning on and off, faces and handprints in mirrors, vanishing objects; hearing random footsteps, rattling doorknobs, children’s cries and unexplained smells.   

The Myrtles Plantation has been featured on “Ghost Hunters,” “Ghost  
Adventures,”” Unsolved Mysteries” and “Most Terrifying Places in America.”  But is this plantation the paranormal hotspot it’s claimed to be? Does it hold the dark and tragic history of poisonings, hangings, mutilation, murder, and gunfire claimed? Can fact be separated from  
fiction? Ericka and her team are about to find out.",t2_699lijv,Natmandu71,0,1647967667.0,0,t1_i1oj39e,i1oj39e,True,Natmandu71,t3_tk7a8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tk7a8q/trifi_trailer_tuesday/,TRIFI Trailer Tuesday...,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tk7a8q/trifi_trailer_tuesday/i1oj39e/,1,r/TriCitiesWA,0,1

A lot of this can also have to do with the quality of the rental management company.

The area in Richland between Jadwin and George Washington way is pretty questionable for apartments in general unless you are north of Snyder or at least Jadwin Stevens and their immediate neighbors keep the rif-raff at bay per management.

Columbia Park apartments (called ""the stilts"" for as long as I can remember) are extra ghetto and cops are always there.  

I always say before you rent a place go to the local minimart/7-11 and check out the clientele.  The shit I have seen at the 7-11 next to the stilts will blow your mind. Though plenty of spots in east Pasco and east Kennewick I'd still consider worse!",t2_3lxd0pwp,abgtw,0,1647794453.0,0,t1_i1f5yf9,i1f5yf9,False,pistachiowhitemocha,t3_tc3u3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tc3u3q/feedback_on_low_income_apartments_in_kennewick/,Feedback on low income apartments in Kennewick and Richland,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tc3u3q/feedback_on_low_income_apartments_in_kennewick/i1f5yf9/,2,r/TriCitiesWA,0,2

My dog definitely does warm up to people over a lot of time and exposure, so perhaps this might be a path to take once things cool off a bit. :)",t2_10imw3,Acronymesis,0,1647546089.0,0,t1_i125jjg,i125jjg,False,Acronymesis,t3_tfwfmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/,Experience With West Richland Noise Ordinance and Owning a Dog Who Barks?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/i125jjg/,2,r/TriCitiesWA,0,2
Have you introduced your pup to the neighbor?  Sometimes that helps.  I think the key is that you are trying to do something you're not just ignoring the problem. I know we have several remotes for the collar so we're quick once ours starts to bark.   Training is the best bet but takes times and for some dogs it still doesn't resolve the issue.  Good luck though!,t2_69vyj2rw,L0GAN_FIVE,0,1647545393.0,0,t1_i123pg2,i123pg2,False,Acronymesis,t3_tfwfmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/,Experience With West Richland Noise Ordinance and Owning a Dog Who Barks?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/i123pg2/,2,r/TriCitiesWA,0,2
"I actually also have one of the manual collars (iQ Mini) and yes, the vibe or zap will bring him in usually. Same deal if my other neighbor's dog is out; just takes a few more pings to get mine to come back in. Works quite well!

The thing is, even if I'm diligent about making sure he's wearing it and listening for barking, I can't have the doggy door open all the time like I have been. I may feel like I'm responding quickly when I get a text from the neighbor, but I think the point is the neighbor feels they shouldn't even have to text me in the first place. Not having a dog incessantly barking every time you're in the back yard is not an unreasonable thing to want, and as much as I would like to allow my dog to go in an out whenever, I should respect that. 

I have concluded that, until/unless I can really work on training him not to react to strangers the way he does, it's best to just remove the doggy door and go back to letting him out periodically. As others have said, with a potential poisoner in the neighborhood, it's that much more for the best for now.

ETA: Another comment I made looks to contradict my statement that I've used manual/hands free collars before and they didn't work at all, but that comment refers to a vibration-only collar.",t2_10imw3,Acronymesis,0,1647545179.0,0,t1_i1235wy,i1235wy,False,Acronymesis,t3_tfwfmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/,Experience With West Richland Noise Ordinance and Owning a Dog Who Barks?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/i1235wy/,1,r/TriCitiesWA,0,1

"Reality is they are donating to help you, not for the tax deduction.  Approaching 10 businesses in your area or that your family does business with is your best bet.  Work on a well crafted letter explaining why you need their support, what you will learn then dress up a bit and then go knocking after school. After your experience you really need to follow up with each donor, thank them in person and with a small card.  Your DECA teacher should be helping you with this.  Your school should have an account where they can send funds that go to support you, but not giving you the actual check. I would not go in asking for $1000 or even $500, ask for $100, $50 or $25. Most local businesses want help, but besides you they get asked by a ton of other well deserving individuals and organizations.

"The hands free bark collars were not the solution.  We do keep a manually triggered one on our Dog and we escalate the ""training"" from noise, vibration and then zap mode.  Normally the vibration or zap mode will bring him running inside.  But if the neighbor dog is barking it may take a few pulses to get the point across.  Really only barks if the other dog is barking (thankfully).  The other dog barks at anything moving.  So I do find the bark collar is effective, but doesn't solve the problem long term.",t2_69vyj2rw,L0GAN_FIVE,0,1647543949.0,0,t1_i1200o8,i1200o8,True,Acronymesis,t3_tfwfmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/,Experience With West Richland Noise Ordinance and Owning a Dog Who Barks?,/r/TriCitiesWA/comments/tfwfmj/experience_with_west_richland_noise_ordinance_and/i1200o8/,2,r/TriCitiesWA,0,2

"Seconding getting the dog inside, better trained, and also investing in a bark collar. 

If your dog cannot stop barking when he's outside and it's enough of a nuisance to disturb your neighbors, and they've told you this multiple times before, they're definitely well within their rights to proceed with filing a formal complaint against you for violating the noise ordinance. If I were in their shoes, I would have already done this. 


Usually, if they call animal control or the police about a dog barking incessantly, they'll issue a warning to you and that's about it, unless they can see the animal poses a threat to the public. If they come out a second time, you could be given a citation, so be forewarned.


There's plenty of options for bark collars that help correct a dog without harming them, like ones that vibrate or even release a strong unpleasant (to dogs) scent instead of shocking, but in my own experience owning a bark-happy dog, it only takes a day or so of wearing the vibrating bark collar before he learned ""barking = weird thing on my neck buzzes like a bumblebee on crack"" 😅


One last thing, you may also want to do something as a peace offering to your neighbor as well, like a gift card to a local restaurant or maybe a batch of cookies plus an apology letter.

I had really bad sciatica in 2019 coming off of deployment. Nothing would help, and I went to multiple doctors. Physical therapy, medications, consultations.

We don’t talk anymore, but getting rid of the sciatica was such a relief. Every once in a while it’ll come back, but it goes away with yoga.
