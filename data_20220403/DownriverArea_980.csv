"Kings forest apartments in Riverview aren't any better. All night I would hear scratching in my ceiling of my 2nd floor apartment. 

One day I found a racoon in my closet that chewed through the drywall. They refused to do anything about it until animal control came, to which I told them to get me a room at a hotel since I have a wild animal loose in my apartment. They told me to sleep on the couch.

"First is negligible.  People are miserable all over this metro area.  Friendliness between someone in OC and Downriver is barely measurable.

Two, Downriver is more affordable because it's less desirable.  Like I said, glad you get an extra bedroom for keeping your kids in, but you're not going to recoup your mortgage when compared to a similar house in OC.

Three, congrats, people can have advanced degrees without being considered academics or shit-heads but, well, keep being a big fish in a small pond.

Four, this is one of the few advantages Downriver has.  More water-front access than OC for obvious reasons.  But being in OC I still have access to plenty of Metro Parks and trails as 

Five, again, OC still has access to plenty of green spaces.

As for why I moved up here, it's a matter of mental motivation.  I live within walking distance of a zoo, central business district, brewery, fast food, two local food markets, and bespoke houses that are a century old.

"I wouldn't say elitism but more about people that care about their surroundings and have a desire to find a better place that fits their ideal opposed to people that settle for the most pedestrian of suburbs, however incredibly ironic that statement is given the context.

I have lived in Downriver most of my life and every single day I tell my partner how much I love my new neighborhood and how glad I am that I moved out of Downriver.  That's not to say that I don't miss it, because there are parts that I do: we still have ""Downriver Days"" where we drive down and tool around Wyandotte, visit Block's, hit up Motor City Antiques, or get Bob-Jo's.  But for every day life, where I'm at now is so much better than living in a former-blue collar bedroom community that furthers it's economical and cultural decline.

As for lending, Mitten Mortgage is a brokerage so they’re not tied to any one lending company, which means they can shop around to get you the best rate.

Prior to this i have predisposition to trains though as i grew up on Orchard/8th as that's only one block away from tracks, moved to Brighton near tracks then moved back to northline/9th which there is only four blocks from the tracks again.

I’d never do it. That was one thing I told the realtor when I was looking years ago in Wyandotte. Not by the track.

"Downriver has world class wetlands.  Lake Erie Metropark has some amazing examples of that including a wetland research center with an eagle pet.  If you go past Monroe to Sterling State Park though you will have another Lake Erie park with a beach and camp grounds with fishing.  Many people don't go there because it has visible factories and it is less appealing than other State parks.  There is a little known feature of this park located away from the beach and off a beaten path.  It has a massive wetland area with miles of winding bike paths.  It can be a little daunting as you get back there, because you are isolated.  There is a large ladder with platform that must be used for research that you can climb and observe multiple swan and goose nests.  Huge fields of wildlife wetlands and forests.  It's great for biking and hiking, but be prepared for a long distance and some bumps.  I would even say that Lake Erie and the beach is a side note to the wetlands, especially in August when the Lilly pad fields are at their peak.",t2_q9m9n,NONOPTIMAL,0,1628832613.0,0,t1_h8r1i4n,h8r1i4n,True,thestonecuttersguild,t3_p33pcq,https://www.reddit.com/r/downriver/comments/p33pcq/lake_erie_metropark/,Lake Erie Metropark,/r/downriver/comments/p33pcq/lake_erie_metropark/h8r1i4n/,7,r/downriver,0,7

"I love visiting Grosse Ile and sometimes work on the island, plus my best friend lives there so my bridge pass gets a hefty work out.

It's a beautiful community and so much great outdoor fun (though you'll find that a lot of people belong to GICC for the fun pool activities there). It is pretty isolated and the Kroger/CVS on the island is small. I can never believe that for the taxes they pay, the roads aren't better, especially if you drive down any of the perimeter roads, they're full of pot holes.

From the real estate perspective, it can be hard to buy on the island. There are never a lot of houses for sale (unless you're looking in the $600K+ bracket), so houses move quickly and there tend to be a lot of pocket sales (sales that never hit the market).

Definitely recommend a visit to the Grosse Ile Hardware store. Where else can you buy hardware, liquor, and guns in one place? They have great popcorn. API recently reopened and I love their pizza.

That is the most Grosse Ile way of putting it hahaha. We peasants have no business on their island.

But seriously I think the island is a great place for retirees or people who like the quietness and solitude.

Frank’s in Wyandotte (the bar, not the pizzeria) is pretty low key, but the owner is sorta…something. You could read and drink there for sure. It’s in the middle of a neighborhood.

Someone in Wyandotte just opened a new coffee spot on Oak. Super cute inside with good drinks and close to the Detroit River. Wyandotte’s new Yogurttown is going to have a bit of something for everyone too.

Not Downriver, but Biergarten in Dearborn is worth visiting too. Cheap drinks, cheap food, and they’ve got outdoor seating in West Dearborn. It’s just picnic tables, but it’s nice.

Down the road down Outer Drive there is Fall’s Sports Lounge, which has wonderful burgers, and cheap, cold beer.

In Ecorse, Taco Especial is a classic. The taco truck on Southfield is also great! Dingell Park is nice for sitting or fishing near the Detroit River. So is Belanger Park in River Rouge.

La Sultana in Lincoln Park is worth checking out for eating Mexican snacks and ice cream. They’ve got super cute outdoor seating on Fort Street.

"I live in Lincoln Park right on the border with Allen Park (AP starts like 4 houses down from me). I feel like I pretty much get the Allen Park experience but with lower taxes. The location is super convenient, close to 94, 75 and Southfield Freeway. I've been here about 5 years with no safety concerns and good neighbors who take care of their properties. There are definitely parts of LP I'd stay away from though. As another comment mentioned, there is the basement flooding issue that has happened a few times, so make sure you have sewer backup coverage on your insurance (this is different than flood insurance).  
  
When I was looking for houses, Southgate and Wyandotte were my other main areas of interest. Taylor has nice parts and not as nice parts. Woodhaven and Trenton are nice but seem more expensive.

"AC systems work with a refrigerant that is compressed under high pressure to turn it from a gas to a liquid through a radiator, then let it evaporate inside where it takes in heat (gives off cold). Especially in cars that are getting a little older, these systems can get leaks, and with the high pressures involved, they can lose that refrigerant pretty quickly. With a tiny leak, you can recharge it (add more refrigerant) every now and then to replace what's lost. With a bigger leak, something like ACPro *might* work by clogging the leak, but chances are it might just clog other things up. The only way to fix it is to have it looked at by a mechanic, where they can put in a refrigerant with a dye, so they can see the dye coming out where it's leaking and replace those parts, replace the entire thing, or replace the compressor itself if that's what's bad. 

So, unfortunately, to my knowledge, it's see a mechanic for an estimate, and if you're like me, you'll see the cost and decide it's not worth it and just keep the windows down.",t2_ago7t,jamese1313,0,1621442950.0,0,t1_gypsomz,gypsomz,True,[deleted],t3_ng8xwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/downriver/comments/ng8xwl/ac_recharging/,A/C Recharging?,/r/downriver/comments/ng8xwl/ac_recharging/gypsomz/,10,r/downriver,0,10

"The effectiveness of vaccines is a matter of scientific facts and not opinions. What you're saying about vaccines is just factually incorrect.

My main concern is not whether you specifically go into a store without a mask. Stores aren't going to ask for your medical info. You showing up in a store without a mask while unvaccinated is being uncourteous and rude to your community, but do whatever you want. It's really not that big of a deal to wear one. The more people there are with your anti-vax anti-mask outlook, the more this virus will stick around longer than it needs to, and the more likely it becomes to mutate into something worse.
