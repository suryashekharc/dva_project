I read in the news yesterday that MP's claim to be unaware of just how bad the housing situation is in the north. 2 years ago, I learned that people in the high arctic pay over $70 for a veggie platter! A lot of Canadians are unaware how vast the north is. They think Whitehorse and Yellowknife are fairly close together.

I know of people down south not wanting to give ""them"" anything, because ""they will squander it on drugs and alcohol instead of taking care of themselves.""

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Invest in good boots and a warm jacket. I have a north face parka that I love and have had for years, and I recently bought Steger boots because my feet get cold no matter what and they’re incredibly warm. Worth the money for sure. 

And the dating scene is interesting. In my experience it’s small and mostly disappointing as a single female in her early 20s. Lots of people I grew up with, lots of friends shitty ex boyfriends. But it’s not all bad, just don’t be a jerk because word gets around fast.

Bring as much furniture as you can! It’s very expensive up here and most places won’t ship. You can shop at the brick but it’s more expensive than down south or you can goto the good expensive furniture store but it’s exactly that - expensive (but very good quality) 

Invest in good winter clothing - wait until summer though at that point and you’ll likely be able to score some good used gear from people who are leaving the north and selling their things online! 
Boots - stegers are the best ! 

It’s a wonderful place. I’ve lived all over the world and never felt somewhere quite like Yellowknife. Put yourself out there and say yes to every opportunity and you will feel the sense of community right away 

For dating - DO NOT BE A JERK. This town is too small for that. You can not ghost someone, see multiple people at once or do anything shady. The good and the bad gets shared between friends so do your best to keep your reputation good. In big cities it’s easier to ghost and ignore but you can not do that here. It’s too small. Everyone will know do just be upfront and honest. If you don’t like someone after a few chats or a few dates be mature and tell them! If you want to keep a dating life private that’s going to be hard to do. Everyone knows everything in the dating scene.  I thought it would bother me at the start but you get use to it.

For food or restaurant recommendations, if you have Facebook, there is a group called Bite Me Yellowknife which always has reviews on local restaurants and restaurants might post specials. It’s a very active group. Definitely check out the Prince of Wales Museum. It’s not very big but always has well curated displays. Also, the tour of the Leg is very good if it’s open then. The whole building is full of symbolism. It also has a great art collection.

But I see a lot of comments online from people all over the world who decided to see the videos for themselves and are surprised at what they find. Canadians peacefully protesting mandates.

"A peaceful protest is one that occurs within the confines of the law and respects the rights of individuals that choose not to participate in the protest.Taking a knee is offensive to some, but does not break any law and does not violate the rights or freedoms of anyone.Placing shoes, does not break any laws, nor does is violate the rights and freedoms of the church.Even blocking a pipeline, does not affect the rights or freedoms of anyone NOT party to the protest.The Convoy Protest is guilty of violations of noise laws, harassment, assault, not to mention an assortment of violations of property and traffic laws.  Outside of a few happy partiers downtown Ottawa, the protest is arguably guilty of violations of Canadian Terrorism Laws by disrupting critical infrastructure for the sake of a political ideology.The protesters then downplay the impact of their violations on the rights and freedoms of those that choose not to participate in the protest.  They present a false narrative of ""peaceful protest"" while breaking the laws and violating the rights and freedoms of others who choose not to be a part of the protest.  That is a classic pattern of abusive behaviour common to domestic violence.Now, let me address a question to the supporters of this protest.  Since you are accepting of violations of Canadian law, and the violation of the rights and freedoms of other individuals in the name of protest.  Where do you draw the line?  What law is it OK to violate?  Clearly, you believe that breaking some noise and traffic bylaws is acceptable.  You gloss over the assault and harrassment of private individuals, so you seem to think that is acceptable.  Preventing the freedom of movement of Canadians by blocking roads and borders is acceptable.  What about arson?  Is it OK to start burning government buildings?  lynching?  Is it OK, to hang a mask-wearer from a light pole?  There is only one line here and is pretty well defined.   A protest is either within the law or it is without law.If a protest cannot stay within the laws of this country without violating the rights and freedoms of others, it is not peaceful, and the protesters that cry so loud about the violation of their own rights are hypocrites and narcissists.Those that would stand by and watch lawlessness, and those the would support the violators of the rights and freedoms of individuals that choose not to participate in the protest are just as guilty of that violation themselves.

"Thank you for your thoughts and concerns. However, I dont see any alarm in a group being right-wing or any qualms so far with the PPC (much less do I find concern with someone confronting BLM, which posts like this should have been made about). Its a smear campaign to call this group an alt-right propaganda machine (which has always been done for anyone identifying as right-wing).

It is unfortunate that protests disrupt a city, but from what I could tell those problems are with a minority of people, and people like to focus on the bad.

Idk about the money laundering, I guess we'll see. And I agree, peaceful protests is within our constitutional right, and what these Canadians are doing is defending our constitutional rights. I know you are right that its the Chief Public Health Officer giving out these ""suggestions"" and ""guidelines"" for the provincial/territorial level to adopt, she has been given these powers during covid and quite frankly its time to take them away. But to go right at the top and plead to the prime minister of Canada must do something. It has in Australian and the UK.

EDIT: And according to CBC, Trudeau is in hiding, he was removed from his home and is in  a secret location.
And to clarify for the right-wing thing, this isnt about left vs right, or even vaxxed vs unvaxxed, that is a division mentality that Trudeau and Canada has created. The Freedom Convoy is for everyone and is supported by all kinds of people, regardless of

Depends on how south you are coming from. If in the rest of Canada right now, you should have the essentials in your vehicle like an emergency kit, snow scraper, shovel, winterized fluids etc.

For the drive, it's always good to add to your supplies in case you break down in -40, and need to wait hours for rescue. Lighter is a must. Candles (they can keep cab of the vehicle above 0, keep a window cracked of course). Sleeping bag. Food/water.

As for winter gear, it's hard to research what works best for you without being here. Instead of taking manufacturers' words for it online (sometimes they say -50 and the product is cold and useless), I recommend seeing what locals are wearing to stay warm. Its not necessarily the latest gear, its durable tried and tested gear. Fur works well too. This is good info about layering - https://ykonline.ca/how-to-survive-your-first-winter-in-yellowknife/ - People have their opinions about what they like, so don't hesitate in asking.

Between Weaver and Devore and Overlander Sports up here, all high-quality winter clothes can be bought up north even sometimes cheaper than in the South. Also no PST. There are also people who leave the north that sell items on the local classifieds.

With that said, once you arrive, do your research quickly and invest in good gear. I have friends who waited years to be comfortable and missed out on enjoying what the north has to offer. Snow castle is 1/4 done, so hope you enjoy it!",t2_djh3y0e,tommypatamkin,0,1642800128.0,0,t1_htniga4,htniga4,True,movingfaraway1,t3_s9cgl2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowknife/comments/s9cgl2/moving_up_check_list/,Moving Up Check List,/r/Yellowknife/comments/s9cgl2/moving_up_check_list/htniga4/,4,r/Yellowknife,0,4
"I'm also from Ontario. 

I had installed previous to leaving, an oil pan heater, traditional block heater, battery blanket and a battery tender.
All cables were routed in a weatherproof box to one plug.
So far this winter, my minivan has always started easily.
For example one morning the vans computer said the outside temperature was -36 and the engine coolant was only -9 before starting it. 

It's a long 3 and a half day drive from Ontario.
In addition to what was already mentioned, if your truck radio has Spotify or even bluetooth, download offline audiobooks or podcasts.  North of Alberta, cell service and radio stations are hard to come by.

I carry X2 Jerry cans, spare tire and air compressor for the section north of Alberta.

"Thank you for the detailed response! I will add the SIP to my checklist of things to do.

That is great to hear about the furniture. I do get relocation support, but being able to buy things up there will make it easier.

Good call on the food - we will definitely stock up on potato flour and spices before we come up.

Do you know off hand if there are any rules about bring alcohol into the territory (Ontario used to have a limit on the amount you could bring).

"Right now, yeah, there's more.

You're going to need to fill out your self-isolation plan (SIP) and get it approved BEFORE you enter the territory. They seem lenient on this if you're already a resident, but as a non-resident, you're going to need to have your SIP approval number with you, and before approval, they'll ask you for additional documents. Thanks to COVID, non-residents are not allowed in the NWT without proof they are moving here. So a job offer, a lease agreement, etc. There's more info here: [https://www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19/en/services/vaccination-testing/self-isolation-plan](https://www.gov.nt.ca/covid-19/en/services/vaccination-testing/self-isolation-plan)

Right now they are recommending you isolate 3 days if you're double vaxxed, and take a rapid covid test (they'll give you at the border). 

You won't be able to apply for health insurance until you've lived here three months, so no rush on that. 

Furniture is easy to find on the cheap(ish) on FB marketplace, or YKtrader. If you have fancy food preferences, or dietary restrictions, consider bringing things with you from the south (example: I am gluten intolerant, and I just moved back here last month, so I brought up a box of gluten-free flours because, while you can buy them here, they're way cheaper in the south).  

Scotch is weirdly cheap here if you're a scotch drinker. Beer is much more expensive. 

If you're moving from BC, be prepared for insurance to confuse the heck out of you. If you're not, we do private insurance here and it won't be a big adjustment. 

I'm pre-coffee, so I'm running out of thoughts here, but that should be a start. It's cold here.

"Predict? No. It is contingent on 2 area of information that is actually available to everyone else in the world. A) Solar weather, and B) local weather. If it’s overcast, you won’t see them. If it isn’t overcast, you might see them.

the pandemic poses a few issues, but they are NOT insurmountable. First, if you know what you are doing, you don’t need a tour operator to get you into a spot. The restrictions require your isolation from indoor public situations, and from interacting closely with people. Seeing the Aurora does not require either of these.

I present the following information not as advice, but just statements. Feel free to ask more questions and I will help to the best of my ability.

January-February is the best time to see them when it comes to local weather. We spend more time too cold for there to be too much overcast. BUT…. BUUUUTT it does happen. This is NOT a guarantee, just more likely. The reason for this is the same reason that it’s a lot less desirable. It’s FUCKING COLD. Here, if i see it’s grey, I know it’s warmer out. And you can definitely, easily, see them without paying a tour operator.

While i”m not interested in being a minute by minute tour guide unless I’m getting paid for it, you are welcome to ask me advice regarding optimizing your chance, and we can work around a way to do so without breaking COVID protocol. Just be advised that in general, optimal viewing is after midnight.

If you’re concerned about credentials, these are my YK stats. I have lived in Yellowknife for 9 years, a city with an insanely high turnover of population. I am “older” that the majority of the town. I live in the best place in town to see the lights: i live literally on Yellowknife Bay. Not suburbs or downtown, but on the water. This means that if the lights are out, I see them when i walk home from a night out.

"Hi Dan,  
Sorry it's a month past, but it's a shame no one has got back to you. Are you looking to come to Yellowknife in particular? or Canada in general. Even most of Canada regards the North as really intense. (something like 90% of Canadians live within 100 miles of the US border). Full disclosure: I'm an American the moved here after living in Glasgow for 7 years.  


Some things are pretty universal across the country, such as healthcare and a more or less friendly spirit. but things can change. Particularly climate wise. The East Coast gets big wet dumps of snow. Ontario and Quebec get kind of similar, but less severe than the coast. The prairies can get wicked cold, down to -40 at times, but then Calgary, closer to the Rockies, can fluctuate wildly. Southern BC gets more rain (Vancouver and Glasgow vie for bragging rights to the wettest place to live). Up here in YK, winter is around 6 months, and for a couple months will stay around -30 with periods down to -40 or worse (further north in the tundra it can get down to -50, windchill of -60). The colder winters can feel more comfortable than the wet ones down south, as the air is really dry. but we're in a -30 slump right now and it's a bit of a bother.

Yellowknife is a surprising town. it's a lot more urbane than you'd expect, but still has the small-town closeness (both good and bad) that you'd expect from a city of 20,000. the downtown core has towers and kind of a high street thing. Old Town is down on the waterfront to Yellowknife Bay, which is a tiny little spur of Great Slave Lake, 10th largest lake in the world. Old Town itself is home to a couple of interesting communities. The woodyard is an old Shack village that still has people living in it, on the water are about 50 houseboats, In the winter one of the houseboaters builds a giant castle out of Snow and Ice (small brag here, I've been on crew for 8 years). There's a craft brewery a block away from the Woodyard (confusingly also called the Woodyard, but usually just called the Brewpub). If you like the outdoors, the best way to deal with the long winter is to make the most of it. personally, building the castle is a huge help, Best workout i've ever had. We're also lucky enough to CC ski for 5 months, a season much longer than most places. the lake freezes to 3 or 4 feet thick, so we can ski across the bay and hit trails all through the bush.

as far as immigrating, I moved here on a spousal visa. it took me nearly 3 years and was morally degrading. That was during Harper, and Trudeau has sped things up a bit. You may be a bit late, but the commonwealth has the whole work visa for under 30s thing which helps a lot. otherwise you may have to find an employer to sponsor your visa. If that's the case, you'll be tied to them until you establish enough tenure to apply for Permanent Residence if you want. I'm sorry i can't help more on that note.

"> Eating at restaurants is a way to meet people? Really? Sitting in their little groups at tables? People actually meet people like that here?

Sit at the bar - people talk to strangers at the bar, not at tables. Go to Monkey Tree and sit at the bar. Do it three times in a week and you'll start seeing regulars. Talk to the bartender - talk to other customers. Soon you'll be in group conversations. Regulars introduce you to more people and your personal network grows. 

This is the same as networking at a conference. When you're selling something (a product, a service), the number of potential customers you talk to multiplied by a conversion ratio gives you the total number of expected sales in a year. It doesn't matter if your conversion ratio is 100% if you talk to zero people. So you can improve your odds by meeting more people, while trying to keep your conversion ratio as high as possible. 

When single, and looking for people to hang out with or date, you don't find these people by staying silent and hoping. You have to actually interact with people. Your conversion ratio might be shit, but you're multiplying that by the total number of contacts you make. You make contacts in restaurants, pubs, arenas, stores, libraries, ptarmicon, the yellowknife mountain bike club, the farmers market, the pottery guild, etc... But only if you actually engage with people. 

So, yes, restaurants are a good way to meet people, assuming you go there for that purpose. 

Reddit is also a way to meet people. When I first moved to YK, I posted about wanting to have dinner with strangers. One of them, u/cliteratimonster, became a long term friend, joined my D&D group, etc. All from a random reddit stranger and dinner at sushi cafe -- good times!",t2_605n1,troyunrau,0,1638564893.0,0,t1_hn44o4b,hn44o4b,False,[deleted],t3_r7aemi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowknife/comments/r7aemi/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Yellowknife/comments/r7aemi/deleted_by_user/hn44o4b/,1,r/Yellowknife,0,1

"How cheaply do you want to live? You can get by with McDonald's wages if you have roommates, but you won't be putting much away. The answer to this question will depend on you. 

For example: do you want to eat at restaurants (single people often say yes because eating is a social activity and it's one of the few ways to meet people) and if so how often? Now you need $25 per meal in your budget, on average -- 5 times a week, add $500 to your monthly budget, and ~$10k to your pre-tax salary. 

Do you want to play sports? Icetime at the arena is ~$400/year per person -- more if you play on more than one team, and you add beer in dressing room, some new equipment once in a while, gas to go to and from the rink... That reminds me, you are paying monthly for a car? Or bussing.

If your Escape doesn't already have a block heater, we just had one installed in one of our cars for $450. Makes morning starts effortless. A battery blanket is less than $70 and they're not terrible to install on your own if you're a little handy, or you can get a mechanic to do it.

If you work downtown you can rent a powered parking space from one of the downtown building management companies for about $150ish/month but there is often a wait list. If you're not downtown/government, ask your employer if there's any powered parking for you and you can keep your engine block warm during the workday too.

Do you leave windows open all summer and perhaps the smell just isn't noticeable until it gets closed? 


Is there something you keep in the bathroom only during winter that you don't keep in there during summer? 


Do your towels dry slower? Maybe the bathmat is growing mildew, It can't dry as quickly because of the temp difference.

"I’m not sure what other’s household income is who replied saying food security isn’t an issue in Yellowknife, but it is.

Food insecure households don’t necessarily have a lack of food on the shelves in stores, but the cost of food relative to household income
is too high- especially when there are intersections of poverty, housing, and other social determinants.

Yellowknife doesn’t have the same distribution issues as more remote communities, but food security is an issue is Yellowknife for people who can’t afford food.

The [2020 NWT Poverty Report Card ](https://www.ntassembly.ca/sites/assembly/files/td_344-192.pdf)

*One in four households in small communities and a rising number in Yellowknife worry about being able to afford food.*

*In 2014, 21.7% of NWT households often or sometimes worried about running out of food before having money to buy more. Almost 40% of these households were in smaller communities. In 2018, almost one in four(23.1%) NWT households worried about having money to buy food and 37% were in smaller communities.*

*Between 2014 and 2018, the number of Yellowknife households worried about affording food rose from 14% to 16.7%.*

*Food insecurity is reflected in use of in-school food programs, food banks, soup kitchens, and community luncheons. Current data on these food programs are scarce.*

*Fishing and hunting are counter-measures to food insecurity, particularly for people living in smaller communities. More than one-third of households in these communities harvest 75% or more of the fish or meat they consume. The ability to mitigate food insecurity with country foods is threatened by climate breakdown.*",t2_fmdhfw6,dis_bean,0,1636514672.0,0,t1_hk0w4t5,hk0w4t5,True,Inspireme21,t3_qq8dld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowknife/comments/qq8dld/issues_with_food_security/,Issues with food security?,/r/Yellowknife/comments/qq8dld/issues_with_food_security/hk0w4t5/,6,r/Yellowknife,0,6

"Yes, there is always lots of work for trades up here!  

Finding housing can be a bit of a challenge and expensive, but your average commute is like 10 minutes :)

There is a tax break for northern living and a travel allowance as well.  The exact amount depends on whether you are single and whether anyone else at your address is making a claim. 

I think the base is about $3K tax credit, and the travel used to be only if your employer claimed part of your wage as a travel allowance, but I think they have changed that.  The travel part is technically based on how much you spend for travelling, but there are some funny rules about it.  Some more info here:  [https://www.taxtips.ca/filing/northern-residents-deduction.htm](https://www.taxtips.ca/filing/northern-residents-deduction.htm)  You can usually claim airfaire from Yellowknife to Edmonton at around $1K per ticket.

"Hi Drywall/ taper,
I'd say that if you are in the trades,  a good worker and adaptable there is plenty of work for you.  All the trades people I know have more than enough work most of the time.  This is a small town but it is the hub for all the communities and if you are willing to travel out of town with a company there is more work there.  Once you get a name for yourself you could also go independent. Plenty of owners are renovating/ updating their houses but there is not so much new build in residential due to land availability. But there seems to be quite a bit of office/ commercial renos too. 
Residents here claim a northern allowance of about $8/ day which you claim back at the end of the tax year. Added to this is a travel allowance which entitles you to claim the flight and travels costs out of the territory also as a tax benefit. But living costs are expensive: expect to pay $1000 for shared accommodation and 300-400/ month for food. If you are serious about coming up here contact some of the main construction companies,  send them your resume and start sorting out accommodation.  Yktrader is a good place to look.

"> Reacting to an emergency isn't ""lying"".

They knew COVID would come here once the borders opened up. They said as much. But they said that if we achieved a high rate of vaccination, which we have, we could live with it and that restrictions wouldn't be re-implemented, that the state of emergency would be lifted and that everyone had to start making their own risk assessments instead. 

The rest of the world is moving on and we're back in lockdown. Several Nordic countries have essentially declared COVID over. Much of the US is back to normal. England is back to normal, as is much of the rest of Europe. Hell, the Yukon ended their state of emergency and removed all their restrictions. 

Maybe instead of spending $80M on a call center and a ""COVID secretariat"" they could have pumped that money into the hospital and we'd be in a much better position. 

Our ""leaders"" have failed us. I said ""leaders"" because they haven't shown any sort of leadership, all they've done is blindly follow the CPHO who can't even get out a coherent sentence and seems to be making it up as she goes along.

Watermark Tower, Polar Developments' other apartment building is newer than ATT, has balconies on all apartments and while there is communal coin laundry on the ground floor, there are laundry hookups in each unit if you want to provide your own machines.

Sun dog Trading Post - super yummy sandwiches and homemade ice cream!!

Korea House - delicious, but a little pricy. We generally make our own bulgogi instead of eating there, but it’s still great food

Zehabesha - Ethiopian food. Yum

Savannah’s - also yum and Savannah is so sweet. Warning that they don’t serve naan, they serve pitas. My partner doesn’t eat there anymore cause he always forgets and is disappointed when the butter chicken is served with a quarter slice of pita. But I’ve always had great meals there

Unrelated to Vista or radio, but ages back I applied and was interviewed for a job in the South where it was clear they wanted me but they refused to talk money. As I was walking down the street after my interview they called me to offer me the position but continued to not be willing to talk money. It was an entertainment-adjacent job where during the interview they asked pointedly if I was interested in the job to make industry connections because they didn't want that. I told them that no, I wasn't interested in getting into the industry, but I was interested in this job. When I finally managed to get the salary range out of them on that walk & talk call I realized that the only people who would take the job are those who are doing so to make connections in the industry...the salary, at their maximum that they weren't willing to offer me, was not a liveable wage for the city it was in.

"To make this clear:

when a child (or anyone unvaccinated) travels, anyone who will be living with the unvaccinated person is required to isolate according to the lowest common isolation requirement (which is the unvaccinated person).

If an unvaccinated person is leaving isolation, they are required to isolate for 14 days, but they may take a covid test on the 10th day of isolation and be allowed to leave early.

"You would need to equip your trailer with a composting or cassette toilet that can easily be emptied at a dump station, otherwise if you use a typical trailer toilet with a black water tank, you're in for a messy time as soon as temperatures are near freezing. As for water, there is no way a trailer plumbing system (pipes, water tank, greywater tank) will not burst as soon as it gets cold, not as messy as black water but a sure way to ruin a trailer. As for heat, a standard propane heater found in most camping trailers wont work. You'll need to install a diesel heater (Chinese ones are cheap, easy to install, and very efficient). Obviously, your trailer would have to be fully insulated. I'm not even sure if this is possible at all to insulate walls, ceiling, floor, windows, door, for a Yellowknife winter.

The next issue is to find a legal spot to park it. Summer is easy. Either at one of the local campgrounds, or somewhere on crown lands where it is free. In winter, this could be more complicated. Maybe rent a spot at a private property at Kam Lake or Con? 

But I think in the end, a trailer may not be a good choice. A van, properly equipped and insulated, would be more practical. Less room and comfort but easier to set up properly for winter. I personally know of two people who've lived in their van in Yellowknife for the past couple of winter. They made it, but it wasn't always pleasant.

Rent and utilities are definitely more.

Sales tax is 5% which makes a difference depending where you come from. 

Income tax is lower.

You can shop online for pretty much anything.

Anything like Staples and Canadian Tire should be same as anywhere.

Flights are half the price they were when we first moved here.

For food, I don’t find it crazy. Some things are more, some things are the same. One difference might be we don’t really get sales. Last time I was in BC, I certainly wasn’t blown away by the prices there.

"Hey OP, first off: CONGRATS ON COMING OUT! Yesss girrrrl! So happy for you! 

It sounds like you’re in a small town, so I’m not gonna pretend to know the small-town politics at play. So, please take this advice with many grains of salt. 

I’d like to present you with an idea: Is it possible this could be an honest mistake? You’ve said in the comments that you didn’t correct the staff member who was misgendering you. That’s a totally fair & valid choice! I can only imagine how tedious & upsetting it could be to have to correct ppl about your pronouns multiple times a day. In a small town where you probably know everyone already, no less! BUT, if you don’t correct them (or ask an ally to please correct them for you if you’d be more comfortable), I’m not seeing the reasons for the leap to the staff being purposefully shitty.

It sounds like you’ve been triggered pretty hard by this. First & foremost, take care of yourself. I’d be happy to help track down local resources for you to build the kind of support system it takes to get through this TOUGH and IMPORTANT phase of your public transition. 

Have patience with yourself. And, if you can, have patience with others too.

"YK has pretty much everything here and is a well resourced bubble- it’s just a city that’s far away from other cities :)

I live, work, and do most shopping downtown. A lot of people don’t advise going downtown, but it’s important to support local businesses and, to be honest, people are friendly and mostly kind their own business.

I’d give the advice wait until you are here before you start buying winter stuff- it’s a northern city, so we’ll resourced with northern stuff) 

There is still a few months until the temps drop (mid to late October) and you could probably do fine with your current winter jacket/gear, and gradually build what you need based on the activities you actually do. 

The beauty is that the circular economy is pretty good here, and you can get second hand items in good shape pretty easily (check out local Facebook classifieds groups and YKTrader.com). 

There are still four seasons here, just in different lengths than say Ontario- you’ll still probably want clothes for each season but start with the basics, and wait until later until you settle in to decide on a parka style/boots that work for what you do most. The super cold doesn’t usually happen until late Nov to March, so you have time.

You can get everything not available in town  online, with free or reasonable shipping- shipping just takes a bit longer than when you are south, but most things come within 10 business days.

I’ve been here 10 years and have only taken the bus once to folks on the rocks- I rarely drive (I have less than 2k kms on a car from 2019), and commute by foot or bike. It’s easy to get anywhere in town.

There’s places you can rent sports equipment like fat bikes, XC skis, kayaks/canoes (over landers and the military has rec equipment) and probably groups you can join to meet up with others who also like outdoor winter things.

It’s easiest to acclimate to outdoor winter temps if you continue to do stuff outside as the temps drop off (like just keep running outdoors and add appropriate layers, if you’re into that. Walk, hike, etc)

There are also lots of indoor facilities to stay active: the multiplex/indoor track/rock climbing wall (and some outdoor climbing groups), fitness centres…

There are some new art things happening- an art coop in the wildcat cafe, various writing, painting, singing, performing groups.

Groceries can be pricey, but it helps to make a list, meal plan, and think ahead to cut down on waste- check out the farmers market and there are various community gardens if you’re into planting.

"I’m from Barrie! - I spent 5 of the last 9 years in NS, 3 in AB and moved to Yellowknife about a year ago so I’ve experience a little bit of all sides of Canada and I love it here. 

Grocery wise I don’t find it much more expensive than down South. There’s less variety and your produce may not last as long but shop smart and it really doesn’t feel too much more expensive. Gas is $$ though. 

Rent is pretty ridiculous if you want a nicer building or a stand alone home but not out of reach on a dual income. The average housing price will be comparable to Barrie but you’re getting a lot less for your money here. 

It definitely has a small town feel. You can get anywhere in about 10 minutes. There’s no crazy parking situations or heavy traffic to deal with. You can pretty much always find someone that knows someone you know which makes meeting people easy - there’s a definite community feel. 

There is a homeless population in the downtown core and some definite addictions issues being battled. That being said coming from the GTA I doubt it’ll phase you. They mostly leave you alone as long as you don’t try to get in their business. Like anywhere - lock your car, lock your house, put away your bikes etc. I’d say the vast majority of our crime is between people that know each other (especially violent crime). I don’t feel unsafe walking the streets alone at any time of night but I wouldn’t go out on the trails by myself after dark. 

If you’re the outdoorsy type you’ll love it. There’s lots of good hikes just outside of town, tons of lakes with amazing fishing, great camping and pretty much every winter activity you can think of. That being said if you’re someone that loves trying new restaurants, or spending your weekends at the mall or browsing homesense you might  struggle to adjust. You can get all the basics + some here no problem but definitely not in abundance (for example sometimes I miss being able to wander a mall and clothes shop  & I would kill for a Mexican restaurant lol). You won’t have a problem ordering anything online though! 

I’d make sure you and your partner both have jobs lined up before moving up.

"Amazon is available and shipping is reasonable or even free if you get the promotional free shipping. 

Any clothes but you’ll need long pants like jeans and a decent coat for the winters here, something for -40° is a good start. 

I pay around $12 for a small pack of ground beef at the main grocery stores and more from the more specialty grocery stores.

 I’m not sure about rental prices. 

Busses have been upgraded recently, I haven’t been on them yet but when I was going to high school they went everywhere but the industrial park and the highway.

 In the winter there’s snowmobiling, a ski hill, a mini snowboard park, ice fishing, and biking (yes, you heard right. They use those bikes with fat tires) as well as hiking, if you’re crazy enough for that in -40.

 If you’re looking to move here try visiting first, there’s plenty of touring companies that will make sure you’re prepared for a few weeks of a Yellowknife winter and show you a few fun winter activities.

"Clothing - make sure you have a decent winter coat with some puffy as a mid layer; puffy pants/bibs, decent winter boots, or mukluks, get some traction aid stuff from MEC, you'll be walking on lots of ice.

Food - in the winter a pack of 3 cucumbers is 5.99; 18 eggs just went up to 6.50; a whole chicken is around 16.00 to 18.00, so similar to down south; pork are beef could be more than 30% depending on the cuts, also prices is probably going to go up quite a bit over the next 6 months because of the draught in the prairies.

Rent - midwest and northview are the big landloards, midwest is arguably a more responsible landlord than northview; that being said rental properties could be tight depending on what you are looking for and time frame; make sure you physically call to ask; mackenzie management is really good; there are a lot of people renting out properties on their own or smaller operations; 1bedroom with in suite laundry will run 1600 to 1750, 2bedroom with in suite laundry will run 2000 to 2200, a single room with common area is usually between 900 to 1100.

Transit - bus is not very robust, you do not want to wait for a bus in the middle of winter; a lot of people do bike as well, bring up a nice bicyle is also a huge plus; look for housing near your work/school; most people work downtown, there are a lot of properties within 15 minutes by walking; the town is divided largely in 4 areas, old town (vehicle or bike would be needed, no city water, uses water tanks), downtown (where most people work and live), uptown (the area by McDonald's and COOP grocery store, large residential areas), kam lake (industrial area, definitely need vehicle or bike).

Winter activities - ice fishing; dog sledding; snowmobiling is prime here; there are quite a few tourism lodges up here, once the border opens it might be hard to book things, but a lot of them have made a decent local market, so they may continue to offer some spots to locals, who knows; hunting; trapping; key is to stay active in the middle of the winter, the city and different community organizations host a lot of events over the winter to keep people entertained; also take vitamin D if you are prone to seasonal affective disorder, improves the modd quite a bit.

Just get out, do things, meet people, it's a smallish community, lots of cool people and fun things, but some times you have to look for it.",t2_10su1omx,Coewick,0,1626671969.0,0,t1_h5py87v,h5py87v,True,Shane1293,t3_omw78p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Yellowknife/comments/omw78p/advice_for_potential_newcomer_from_ontario/,Advice for Potential Newcomer from Ontario!,/r/Yellowknife/comments/omw78p/advice_for_potential_newcomer_from_ontario/h5py87v/,5,r/Yellowknife,0,5

"Great question. I lived in Niven when i first moved to town, and had a studio next to Gov Dock, so i was always looking fun ways to commute.  


a quirky one is to head underneath the large wooden bridge and follow the trail through the tunnel under Niven Drive (this part is a little wet). the trail will take you down to back bay. this is more doable in the winter, as the stream in the tunnel will be frozen (this is a legit trail, use by snowmobiles.)  


Another alternative is to find the entrance to the Niven Loop closer to the bottom of Niven Dr. There's a mailbox there. you'll notice a crosswalk painted on the road there that leads to a trail between two houses called Jossa Dr. It will take you down the hill and behind the Raquet Club, dumping you out at the Softball fields. make your way through or around the fields into Peace River Flats and you'll get access to the boat launch/dock on Anderson Thompson Boulevard.
