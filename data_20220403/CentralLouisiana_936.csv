"Yes I do still live in Pineville and actually have also begun looking at real estate.  It hasn’t taken me long to decide to stay in Pineville or if I go anywhere it would be between Pineville to Tioga area.
     I do not really know of specific serious problem areas that need to be avoided as in Alexandria but there are sketchier areas.  Mostly the older section of Pineville by the college to Main Street areas and slightly down 107.   That’s mostly older homes that have disrepair and you’ll know it.
The newer areas have some rather new constructions and areas down 28, Sussex and such are good and a couple of really new subdivisions down a little further.
   The downside I am finding now is that since Hurricane Laura and I am not sure why it’s still this way but housing has been in a shortage here and has driven prices a little high I think for Pineville.

This is a discussion sub am I correct?  One in which if you scroll down another news item ironically of a local arrest or more specific sentencing appears.  My question was why is this news not being discussed here on a site specific to Cenla and yet is on another discussion site?

If I posted my gardening results this spring that could technically be labeled “news”.

There definitely are some unfriendly people in the area. It's just how some people are. But, I wouldn't associate it with Pineville specifically. Plenty of nice folks there as well. But yes, the more rural areas will tend to have people who are unwelcoming.

As for hating Alex, or thinking it's particularly dangerous, truth is it's on a SERIOUS decline. I can remember growing up in Alex, and it felt like a city that was thriving. Now it feels like a city that's falling apart. I guess the economy has taken a really hard turn in recent years, but what once was a really nice place to live is looking more and more blighted. And I don't think it will be coming back, sadly.

Just down the street from my parents house is a park. It's been there since I was a kid. I played there from the time I was born. We took our kids with my mother there last summer and some guy tried to sell us drugs. That wouldn't have happened 10-15 years ago. (I have no idea why the guy thought we would want that either - 60 year old woman, wife & husband with three under four... if that's a ""normal"" customer for this guy, that's just as big a problem imo)

Anyway, it's still a good city.

"One of the big problems with locals is that they are so resistant to change. 

I have a guy I know in town who want to rehabilitate Bringhurst field.  I know he has great memories of the Aces playing and getting to go to the games and see his friends, and that's great.  But that place is beyond repairable.  It is an eyesore at this point that needs to be razed to the ground. The city also built a playground in right field so that would need to be taken down if we were going to play host to another minor league team.

That is just one of the sacred cows people in this city have. Louisiana politics are/is another reason for the state of the city. It is nice to see people who aren't old white guys helping make decisions in town, and this is coming from an old white guy. We need other peoples' input if we are to thrive, and that means people with whom we may not agree.

Shreveport is declining, but as they decline, Bossier City has picked up.  So it's not as if people are leaving the area, only relocating across the river.  They also have a few universities there including LSUS, Centenary and LSU Medical School. Those really help prop up their economy.

"I do enjoy the churches, sense of community, food, and relaxed pace of living. Yes, I have heard some horror stories about crime and most of them originate from Bolton Avenue and the Garden District. I have been on Jackson Street in the middle of the night and experienced no issues. Of course, it’s not advised to go venturing out into the night in any city. 

It’s not fair to say that Alexandria is among the most dangerous cities in the country. Cities like Memphis and Detroit are incredibly dangerous. People have been killed in categorically safe areas and randomly attacked. It’s incredibly easy to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. The crime in Alexandria is in concentrated areas that can be avoided. 

Although Alexandria may not be as lively and active as it once was, it’s by no means a dead town. There are people who love being here and feel completely safe. The other day, I spoke to a co-worker who relocated to Alexandria with his family from Jackson, MS 10 years ago and he told me that he feels very safe in Alexandria. In fact, he said that 1-2 people are murdered in cold blood in Jackson every single day. 

I think you’re limited experience makes you biased against Alexandria. Regarding Pineville, I personally believe that it’s more of a hamlet of Alexandria than a separate city. The people there are very close minded and hostile in general.

"May e you do t live in the garden district, I do and I hear on average at least...AT LEAST 4 gunshots a night! A couple months back someone stole my neighbors gun out her car and shot my dog then shot at my home 4x with my children right near where they shot at! I called the cops, they apprehended the people and took them to jail. This was NEVER on the news. My best friend does local crime reporting here and she is the ONLY person to speak up about any and all known crimes in Alexandria! The mayor picks and chooses what he wants to release on our news station! Several crimes have gone unreported on by the mayor! He’s a joke! I have lived here my entire life born and raised and Alexandria is NOTHING compared to what it use to be!!! My uncle is Jarrod King, he was APDs chief of police and I won’t say much but I will say, he was pushed out of his position because of speaking up! If you are not from here or haven’t been here long please do not say that Alexandria is not riddled with crime! I am 30 years old and have traveled quite a lot all throughout the USA and especially through Louisiana and I can say without a doubt that Alexandria is #1 in the state for worst crime! Hell just back in late nov or early dec someone drove by a store down Jackson street shooting random people at the gas pumps with an AK-47! This was spoken about ONCE then it disappeared! They put people in jail on MINOR infractions and leave them there to rot yet the mayor is out here hiring KNOWN CORRUPT friends of his to run high powered positions in Alexandria! This place is fucked I know that for sure and do not get me started on the drugs! I’m a recovered addict and I know and work with recovering addicts in my spare time! I know many many MANY people out here, the life they live and the things they do and trust me, the drugs in our street is absolutely Insane! The homeless!!!! They don’t even dare mess with them! You drive down Bolton ave a certain time at night and all you see is hookers, dope heads and homeless folk and then right beside the APD station AT THAT!  
Like I said I live in the GD, not an outstanding neighborhood but pretty fucking decent with very respectable and decent neighbors, I love 2 blocks from the APD station and all the time you just see random dope heads walking our neighborhood! Last month around 2am some white chick (clearly on dope) knocked on my door with a tiny infant and I mean about a month old, begging me to keep her baby so she could go prostitute!!! I was shook! I had absolutely no clue what to do and I badly wanted to run her off but my heart hurt for that baby! I told her YES bring the baby and all supplies and I kept that baby for a few hours then Called the cops and let them handle from theee! Absolutely ridiculous! 
For my family of 4 and mind you we are legit NEVER home except to sleep, my utilities were $600 last month!! SIX HUNDRED!!!
The businesses here have gone to absolute shit and so have the people! You want your kids to get a good education well you better have money!!! You wanna do something with the family or kids???! Well you better go out of town because Alexandria sure as shit won’t do shit!!
Pineville AINT all that but compared to just 5 years ago, they are fucking booming! The mayor been in office for YEARS and he holds his city down!! He takes great care of his city!!! 
I can go on and on about all the fucked up things here in Alexandria and trust me, all the fucked up people (I know lawyers, doctors, politicians, city workers etc) who do unspeakable acts and I have proof and yet they still get paid to run this city into the ground!!

"Here's a native's take on CenLA as a whole:

* There's not much to do unless you're a sportsman in which case there's literally everything to do. 

* The local flair is almost non-existent outside of some unfounded high school pride of multiple extremely racist mascots.

* Everyone always talks about ""Laffy"", Monroe, BR, etc having more and being better, but the truth is most of LA is shit with a few little good parts. But nobody focuses on the local, they'd rather go somewhere else for stuff and give other metro areas their money.
* The crime thing is truly just pearl clutching. I lived there for 20 years and not once did I feel like I was in danger at any time of night in any regular area of the city.
* When BWW is THE thing to do in an area, there's a problem
* Louisiana as a whole is regressive af and corrupt as shit. 

I've since moved on to bigger cities and found out that I have nothing for CenLA and will only ever go back there to see family until they pass. My parents even left because nobody patronizes local businesses so it was tough being an entrepreneur there.


Now for the good: 

* Go to Harlows and get donuts
* Get BJ's Pizza
* Go to lunch at The Cottage on Jackson (They're only open lunch)
* Check out the Zoo. It's kinda sad, but a lot of cities just don't have one at all, so enjoy.
* Kisatche is a big place with a lot to see. Take advantage of that.

Does anything happen downtown? I've gone four or five times on various days of the week at different times of day and there's no activity and places are closed.

My coworkers who have lived here longer say they don't necessarily expect people to stay too long; they either move to Lafayette or out of state. In my experience, that's true: two coworkers moved about a year after starting.

Just an observation: The road layout is weird, with the frontage roads parallel with the highway (like on LA-28 and US-71). I have not seen that anywhere else. It leads to awkward intersections where one or two cars can pull up to the light while everyone else waits (like Baldwin and US-71, MacArthur & US-165), and if someone wants to turn off the frontage road then there's a long line of cars behind them.

"Folks who have lived in Alexandria for about 30 years or more have memories of a once wonderful city. The loss of England AFB, Dresser Industries, Hot Wells resort, International Paper, and other businesses have left the city a mere shell of what it once was. Alexandria is in a spiraling state of decline. I think we can anticipate more national chains leaving. Brick & mortar stores will decline in number. This area is nationally recognized as an ambulance chasing, sue-happy populace. 
     But it’s also got rich, fertile soil. It’s surrounded by national forest. I think Alexandria will slip back down to it’s agrarian roots……and that’s not necessarily a bad thing…..",t2_5hbotny8,Caulkster,0,1641819717.0,0,t1_hs22w26,hs22w26,True,AnonymousX990,t3_s0bxx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/s0bxx0/why_does_everyone_hate_alexandria/,Why does everyone hate Alexandria?,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/s0bxx0/why_does_everyone_hate_alexandria/hs22w26/,7,r/CentralLouisiana,0,7
"I will agree with 95% of what you are saying. I will respond to your question with another question. What is so nice about Alexandria?

-There is little to do to entertain kids.
-There is little to do to entertain adults.
-The food scene sucks (I will admit that it is starting to get better in the last few years with some good non chains opening)
-People get shot every couple of days. (I will give you that it mostly happens to people that appear to be up to no good)
-No culture to speak of. It is too far north to be Cajun. It is too far south to be North LA. Nobody wants to claim it.

"Check out the guy I went to, I edited it into my post.  

I looked into hawks, and while they were rated well, they remind me too much of the shop I used to go to back home.  Auto technician garages are great for the first 100k miles, but there's a point where an engine needs a deeper maintenance than they typically give.  This is due largely because those types of places are going to have one mechanic (the guy who owns the place) and the rest of the staff is oil and tire guys.  That one guy may be a good mechanic, but he is always **busy**.  He will not do shoddy work, (which is why he's fine doing the typical mid life replacements like water pump, or electrical etc) but he isnt going to do the deeper kinds of cleaning that an older engine is gonna start requiring during maintenance.  For instance, it takes a lot less time to just run some fluid into a throttle and swish the valve than to actually remove the throttle, clean it by hand and put it back in.  The results however are not even comparible.

Inevitably, the car starts getting a rumble, and because auto tech garages are tech, not pure mechanic, they naturally are going to blame the suspension.  This is just the nature of 2 different focus areas of experience but it takes a lot more money to rule out suspension than maintenance/deep cleaning, and a tech shop is already convinced the car is maintenances enough.  

In any case, I am not trying to knock mr hawk, I've never been to his shop - but I will say from experience that you should go to a pure mechanic if you need to get done a purely mechanical job.",t2_e1f4n396,_entropic,0,1637936712.0,0,t1_hm5nrxk,hm5nrxk,False,_entropic,t3_qys8pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qys8pb/car_mechanic_recommendation/,Car Mechanic Recommendation,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qys8pb/car_mechanic_recommendation/hm5nrxk/,1,r/CentralLouisiana,0,1

"There’s crime virtually everywhere. There are random shootings in Cleveland. In Gary, Indiana and East St. Louis, IL, people are encouraged by police officers to drive through the stop signs because stopping for even a split second could result in danger. They don’t really say that in Alex. 

I would avoid the Garden District and Bolton Avenue at all costs. Other areas aren’t that bad. You just need to use common sense. Avoid driving through abandoned areas or walking alone at night. Definitely don’t venture away from the crowds. 

As I said before, Alexandria is by no means the safest. At the same time, it’s nowhere near as dangerous as what the locals and so called crime stats websites (neighborhood scout, kalb) make it out to be. Those sites don’t use accurate methods of measuring crime. The FBI has cautioned the public from making generalizations about an area: ""These rankings, however, are merely a quick choice made by the data user; they provide no insight into many variables that mold the crime....Consequently, these rankings lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions...""

"“Making sweeping generalizations about a city based on specific experiences in the dangerous parts of town”. This is getting exhaustive to continue to point out in your own behavior and words evidence “the people there are incredibly hostile and rude(ie Pineville I presume) “ is that not making strong generalizations about a city based on your specific experiences ? The accusation you are so comfortable aiming at me? And that your experiences consist of being hurt/offended by name calling and that you couldn’t get a script filled?  First off “yankee” in this area is not necessarily used as a derogatory slur meant to demean someone.  I have often been called yankee because I come from north if I-10.  It simply denotes someone a more northern location who may not be familiar with local customs, traditions and language.  In my experience it’s been good natured teasing and an invitation for southerners(Cajuns or creole here in Louisiana) to demonstrate said culture to the “yankee” educate and invite them to experience and be a part.  The pharmacy complaint is so ridiculous I don’t even want to address it that you equate a drugstore’s policy to a sweeping indictment of the community’s citizens?  Again I suggest to you that you examine yourself before making accusations of others.
I also suggest you scroll down this site(very easily done no effort involved) and educate yourself about the city in which you live.  It is completely ignorant to equate crime rates with the cities you mention as they are all much much larger with greater populations so of course there’s more crimes! 🙄 when adjusted per capita Alexandria has an inordinately higher crime rate. If you actually follow my suggestion you will find at least two or three reputable news stories about Alexandria crime including that 2021 which is not over yet has set a record high homicide rate with more homicides in the first seven months than occurred all last year.  You will also find news reports of the crimes that I mentioned that you “have never heard of” implying that they were not true and that perhaps I lied?  Specifically you will find the news report of the mudbug festival shooting I mentioned and also the movie theatre shooting.
So please explain to how you “have not heard any stories of the shootings I described” in the city in which you reside and feel you are so knowledgeable about as to claim that crime reports are “over exaggerated “ because we don’t want people “to move here”.  And then please elaborate further such arrogance and confidence that you exhibit as to make your accusations on the very site where one can read for themselves objective reporting and facts that completely substantiate my claims, simply by scrolling down.  Seriously where does your confidence in your ignorance stem from?
This is so ridiculous that I am questioning if you are one of those internet trolls just trying to incite me.  Because although I should probably not be surprised to find someone on social media publicly exhibiting such overwhelming arrogance matched by their ignorance such that they feel justified in making offensive accusations of a complete stranger and at exact same time being completely oblivious of their own behaviors.
I suggest that you reread my original posts in which I do not make sweeping generalizations and claims that Pineville is “better” than Alex nor do I dissuade anyone from moving anywhere.  I am not going to retype it all but my ending was that I attempted to give as much reliable information as to assist in an informed decision.  REREAD IT.  Then please REREAD my reply to you since you instead of addressing the issues I raised about you and your behaviors, you continue to make accusations of me and others which are personally offensive and demonstrating a complete lack of insight are behaviors that you have exhibited in this very thread.  And then to reach the conclusion in which you make a blanket general accusation(something you accuse me of)  against an entire town because of name-calling and a complaint about a prescription???? Oh and maybe something with alcohol sales?  Really???
I have had enough of this nonsense clearly you have some personal issues that need some sorting out.  If it weren’t that your remarks to me were so completely and totally out of the realm of who I am and what I stand for and try to back up with my actions and therefore very offensive I would never have wasted my time here.  I sincerely without animosity suggest one last time you slowly re read the posts and really objectively consider what you wrote.  Unless you wish to answer any of my questions I posed or issue an apology please do not respond any further.  You are wasting my time and embarrassing yourself",t2_fmvzsl1w,Ok_Winner101,0,1636259016.0,0,t1_hjmzoyj,hjmzoyj,False,AnonymousPete23,t3_qfxm7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qfxm7i/is_it_me_or_is_pineville_way_different_than/,Is it me or is Pineville way different than Alexandria?,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qfxm7i/is_it_me_or_is_pineville_way_different_than/hjmzoyj/,1,r/CentralLouisiana,0,1
"What I am saying is that there is criminal activity in virtually every city in the US even in the relatively nice areas. I don’t believe that any city is completely safe from all harm and danger. I have lived in big and small cities across the Midwest and Northeast, which were way more dangerous and eerie than Alexandria and even other Louisiana cities. I was concerned about the crime rate prior to moving here for work and was told to move to Pineville. Some people even went ahead and encouraged me to commute from larger cities like Lafayette and Baton Rouge due to the criminal activity. I decided to move to Alexandria and I have to say that it is not a terrible city to live in. Some parts are very safe and secure others not so much. It’s very easy to tell the difference. Yes, it’s not the safest place but by no means is it the most dangerous in the country or the state as some sites have suggested. There are many people who have called this place home for generations and have had no issues. I have traveled to the grocery store, gas station, gym, and restaurants in the dead of night without any issues. It’s unfair to tell people not to relocate here due to the crime rate because it’s clearly overinflated. Alexandria is way safer than cities like Memphis, New Orleans, Shreveport, Jackson, Chicago, Detroit, NYC, Dallas, Miami, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Gary, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Cleveland, etc. 
Every day someone is killed in these cities. Places like Bolton Avenue, North MacArthur Drive, and neighborhoods near the Alexandria Zoo are indeed very dangerous especially at night. The neighborhoods near Colliseum Blvd. and Horseshoe Drive are incredibly safe. There are police officers patrolling the area all day. 

I respect your passion for community outreach and helping those in need. However, I was upset that you were making such strong and sweeping generalizations about a city based on specific experiences in the dangerous parts of town. It seems as though you were overly praising Pineville and making it out to be this safe haven. Yes, it might have a SLIGHTLY lower rate of crime than Alexandria but it’s by no means better to live there. The people are incredibly hostile and rude. I have out of state license plates and I have constantly been confronted about it from the locals. They have called me names like “Yankee!” Additionally, pharmacies in Pineville have refused to fill prescriptions for me because I have an out of state provider. People in Alexandria seem to mind their own business and are generally more friendly than those in Pineville.",t2_8xm4aanl,AnonymousPete23,0,1636228906.0,0,t1_hjl8qvj,hjl8qvj,False,AnonymousPete23,t3_qfxm7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qfxm7i/is_it_me_or_is_pineville_way_different_than/,Is it me or is Pineville way different than Alexandria?,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qfxm7i/is_it_me_or_is_pineville_way_different_than/hjl8qvj/,2,r/CentralLouisiana,0,2
"Well actually I relocated here 15 years ago and I work community outreach in those areas that you don’t go to, and interact on an individual basis with the people living in such neighborhoods in their homes that you avoid. I would suggest you not call attention to your ignorance by accusing me of “having problems with diversity”.  And not only do I work with them, a great many I consider personal friends.  The comments I made are based on the information I am privy to by my presence and communication in those “areas you avoid at all cost.”  Which begs the question?? What is the basis for your blanket discrimination of those areas?  Do you have a in issue with the architecture or is it the inhabitants that you don’t know anything about or even expose yourself to?  Why avoid them if you don’t know them?  Are you making assumptions and judgement on because I have a feeling the neighborhoods of which you speak are not the new upscale white subdivisions are they?  Take a look at yourself before you accuse someone who you know nothing of.  Show me receipts and I’ll show you mine-  how many families have you provided Santa Claus for their children when they could not, how many students have started the school year with uniforms from you when their families were struggling, how much transportation to stores and doctors , etc have you given(or are you more likely to lock your car door ). Let’s go even a little further since you have accused me of being judgmental and implied racist— show the receipts of how many cigarettes and funds you given without judgement of their crime, to those in our local jail who are without.  How many addicts have you transported to the OR when they overdosed?  Or doses or narcan have you personally bought and distributed so that someone’s life might be saved?
And as for you not hearing of any of these issues it might be like the neighborhoods and their inhabitants that you avoid.  If you just scroll down and look at the KALB sight just last week- Alexandria was named the most dangerous college city in the nation by Study.wise research group.   I don’t believe that group is from Pineville and I don’t believe they pulled that ranking out of their asses.
And before you display any more of you ignorance, let me go ahead and reveal why I am so involved in Alexandria in those neighborhoods that you avoid— I am a blessed to be a substance abuser in recovery and those neighborhoods where I would once buy my drugs I now am dedicated to helping without judging anyone.  Last week an addict I had known in my days of using I discovered homeless on a street corner.  I brought him to my home and let him shower and groom, supplied him groceries and them without preaching took him back where he wanted to go.  
I cannot speak for everyone in Pineville but if you look up the statistics it speaks for itself as to crime and I would never presume to judge an entire group of people as wanting “to hurt others because they are different”. 
So I ask you again to show your receipts and come at me again with the implied accusation of discrimination and racism.",t2_fmvzsl1w,Ok_Winner101,0,1636226829.0,0,t1_hjl40mx,hjl40mx,False,AnonymousPete23,t3_qfxm7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qfxm7i/is_it_me_or_is_pineville_way_different_than/,Is it me or is Pineville way different than Alexandria?,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/qfxm7i/is_it_me_or_is_pineville_way_different_than/hjl40mx/,1,r/CentralLouisiana,0,1

"I believe that a lot of people from Alex and Pineville make the crime rate seem much worse than it actually is in order to discourage people from moving here. I was terrified to relocate her after hearing horror stories about the criminal activity in Alexandria. Honestly, it’s not as bad as what you all are making it out to be.

I’ve driven around in the middle of the night without any issues. There are certain areas that you want to avoid at all costs but other than that, I don’t see the big issue. And I have not heard of any stories of the shootings you described. To be honest, every city will have crime to some degree. I personally think that your opinion is a bit biased as you are from Pineville and obviously have issues with the diversity that exists in Alexandria. Everytime I go to Pineville, people judge me because they know I’m not a local. They are very callous and hostile.

"Well I must admit that I have lived exclusively in Pineville since my family moved 15 years ago and we chose Pineville for a number of reasons, good public school(at the time) and land(short supply in Alex) substantial lots (ours was 2 acres) that did not cram houses close together (as we often saw in neighborhoods)  but the main reason was that my husband could easily commute to his clinic in Marksville.   All that said, I travel to Alexandria at least 4 or maybe 5 times a week to run errands, visit and so on.  
    On the topic of crime, what is reported as well as what’s going around in the streets and personal experiences, I think there’s some really credible evidence that pretty much all highlights the differences in crime between Alexandria and Pineville as real and significant.(even adjusting for size).  And what’s really sad to me is that there’s not
Just more crimes committed in Alex but the nature of the crimes are much more serious and crime is significant concern of many of my friends in Alex.  The economy of Alex has really gone downhill over the last decade or more, a lot of businesses closed and some like the mall are barely limping along(I get depressed there), white flight to Pineville and Tioga, and the African American community in their traditional poverty striken hoods of Alex(which you need to make sure to familiarize yourself and be careful around) drugs have flooded but the worst part about Alex(I do some community outreach work so I see a lot) is what I hear in the drug community (which is flooded with fent) the worry and concern I hear in the old-timers talk of the young guys running the streets all packing guns now which is something we didn’t have a serious past issue.  They are not only putting more guns on the street they have much much less reservation about using them.  It’s crazy.  Just off the top of my head, recent downtown festival they shot the performer while still on stage!! An innocent couple at the movies last month got caught in crossfire luckily they recovered.  An in the last two weeks, (and I don’t know if it was found) the police have blanketed the streets desperate to locate an assault weapon( which we never really had before either) used in a drive by incident.
    I am not trying to scare you and I hate painting a negative picture of Alex.  I have friends living in Alex.  What is important is location, the violence is usually sorta contained in high risk neighborhoods that you should familiarize yourself.   There’s a tremendous of new development and housing more to the Coliseum direction and I don’t know about what’s available but the airport is a good location.  There’s a great condo development with extensive security near Longleaf hospital.

I am sorry if you had a bad experience in Pineville.  I hope you give it another try and not  just let one experience keep you away.  I don’t know how liberal you are but there might be slightly be a little skew to white conservative beliefs.  And I do have African American friends who half jokingly voice concerns about crossing the bridge.  For example there’s a convenience store under the bridge they have given the name “last stop” because it’s the last stop many of them joke that they feel comfortable at before going to the “white” Pineville and Tioga area.  And of course there is the presence of Louisiana College which is an extremely conservative religious institution.  But the people themselves and I moved here after trying a smaller town in Avoyelles Parish which was truly a nightmare ( coming from a more urban diverse liberal hometown) and found it to be much better.

"It's really, really bad. One of the worst components of the toxic stew they use to make railroad ties and telephone poles might be Pentachlorophenol, which contains TCDD dioxin. 

""The Dioxin impurities in the Pentachlorophenol used to treat the wood products have resulted in Dioxin bioaccumulating in the blood of individuals living within a 2 mile radius of the wood treating facilities.""

Alexandria 3.6 times the national average  
Pineville 7.8 times the national average

**Attic Dust Dioxin**

"Hi there! Yes, we do accept samples from private land with some caveats. 

Many trees on private land were planted for landscaping purposes and are genetic clones to trees from other areas which could skew the database. So, trees on private land must be 78.5"" in circumference to ensure they pre-date planting practices. Additionally, you would be responsible for securing permission from the landowner to access and conduct sampling on that land -- in this case, that should be easy as its your land!

"From what I can tell, no one in Alexandria seems so worried to be leaving. They cleared the shelves at Kroger, though. I haven't seen anyone put sandbags around their door which led me to think this won't be too bad. I think I'll get some tomorrow for my own peace of mind.

On r/neworleans there's much more talk about leaving (which makes sense). Reading that sub rubbed off on me. 

The potential power outage, flooding (I've never experienced a flood either), and effects on tap water worry me the most. The winter weather event wasn't fun. Where I'm from, that wouldn't have stopped anything but Alexandria was essentially shut down for a week. I hope, being Louisiana, they'll bounce back more quickly from a hurricane.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"I’m gonna be honest with you as someone who is in their early 20s (and more of a “liberal conservative”) and lived here all my life...do not say things like “I’m already a racial minority!” here. There are some people who will take that and run with it. They will push it and be very rude about that subject to you. A lot of people down here are very conservative and do not like people who whine and complain and give what they believe are excuses for everything (no offense but that sentence sounds like you’re playing the victim, which they wouldn’t like). 

Down here manners are pretty important, so is religion, politics, and football. There are bad areas and good areas just like everywhere else in America. There is racism here just like everywhere else in America. You will learn to adapt. I’d suggest not going out at 2am, that’s asking for trouble. If you’re working at Rapides, you’re in good hands! It’s a great hospital and everyone is very nice and helpful. 

Sadly, Louisiana is well..poor. There’s not much for kids/teens/college kids to do around here which leads to trouble. The mall is absolute shit. Food is good, lots of places to eat that’s for sure.

You can choose Charles Park, and Martin Park subdivisions but those still have their issues.

"I used to live in the city for about 3 years and had a positive experience. I didn’t really see a lot of homeless, except maybe one posted in front of a Walmart and downtown. I hear they round up all the homeless from the surrounding neighborhoods and drop them off downtown at the salvation army. 

Traffic wont be a big deal if youre coming from a bigger city like NYC. My biggest pet peeve are drivers going 5 under the speed limit during rush hour, and people here in drive in a way that creates traffic imo.

I haven’t had an issue with crime in my time here although I grew up in a bigger city so I’m more aware of what can happen and take steps to prevent that from happening, stuff like hiding valuables from your car, etc.

Politically this is Trump country but there are people here that arent fanatical trump supporters and even democrats. People in general are friendly although Ive come across a few that may be prejudiced to my race (or maybe they are just assholes, idk what to make of that) but I dont surround myself with either types.

It’s a good city if you want to slow down your pace and relax. It’s in the middle of a forrest and there are many outdoor activities to do.

City Wide Boil Advisory Lifted
Alexandria, La. (February 24, 2021)—The City Wide boil advisory issued Wednesday, February 17, 2021 is now lifted. Power has been restored to all COA wells and production facilities and system pressure has been restored to normal. The State of Louisiana has tested the water, and the results of the tests are clear, according to Utility Director Michael Marcotte.

The Alexandria Water Department has lifted the boil advisory for the properties located in the area described below:

All the properties served by the City of Alexandria Water System: (Please see attached detail map). 

With the lifting of the boil advisory, the City of Alexandria now recommends that businesses and residences in the affected areas: 

Run cold-water faucets for one minute;        
Run drinking water fountains for one minute;         
Flush automatic icemakers (make three batches of ice and discard);

"Below is the update that was posted last night on the City of Alexandria's facebook page.

*City Asks Residents to Continue Water Conservation Efforts*

*Alexandria, La. (February 20, 2021) — City of Alexandria officials continue to ask all water customers to use as little water as possible until further notice as the city works to refill water tanks and restore water pressure.*

*“We are grateful to everyone who has stepped up by eliminating or reducing their water use. You are making a difference,” said Alexandria Mayor Jeff Hall. “The system is slowly starting to stabilize, but it is still extremely fragile. It’s critical that everyone continue to use as little water as possible. Any increase in usage could wipe out the progress we have made so far. I know it creates a hardship, but if we all keep working together we can get through this.”*

*Utility Director Michael Marcotte said the key to improving water pressure is refilling the four elevated water tanks that serve the city. “Getting those tanks filled is critical because that is where our water pressure comes from – it’s a gravity fed system – so we need to get the water levels back up in those tanks as quickly as possible.”*

*Hall said the city has not mandated the closure of any businesses at this time. “We are asking everyone to voluntarily limit their use of water. Now is not the time to go to a carwash or engage in any activity that uses a large amount of water,” Hall said. “Our hope is these actions will allow our water supply to recover. If not, additional steps may become necessary.”*

*Marcotte added business and property owners should continue to inspect pipes for leaks. “Temperatures warmed up enough today that any frozen pipes should have thawed, so it’s imperative that people thoroughly inspect their water systems for leaks and shut off water to any broken pipes,” Marcotte said.  “We still need people to treat a water leak like they would a crime – if they see it, they need to call us at 318-473-1264 so we can come turn it off,” he said.*

*The city-wide boil advisory issued Wednesday remains in effect. Residents are advised not to drink the water until they boil it, which includes bringing the water to a rolling boil for at least one minute.*

*“It will be up to the Department of Health as to how long the boil advisory remains in place,” Marcotte said. “Once system pressure stabilizes we will start testing water quality. Those tests can take 24-48 hours if not longer. The boil advisory will remain in place until testing shows the water is safe for residents to drink.”*

*To assist residents during the boil advisory, the city distributed 900 cases of bottled water to residents Saturday afternoon. “We are grateful to GOHSEP (Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management) for the water we received today,” Hall said. “We placed an order for bottled water before the storm and this was the first shipment. We expect to get more and will distribute that to residents as soon as it arrives.”*",t2_35rydl1r,IrateRedFox,0,1613932844.0,0,t1_go92pxa,go92pxa,True,EngineEngine,t3_lp1m01,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/lp1m01/update_on_alexandria_water/,Update on Alexandria water?,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/lp1m01/update_on_alexandria_water/go92pxa/,1,r/CentralLouisiana,0,1

"Yes, and being an outsider to this state, the glaring holes in the situation are even more obvious to me. And checking the sex offender registry in every place I've ever lived, before buying a house, renting, deciding to move there is something I do religiously, as well as other research. So that's why this hit me so hard. I've never really seen a population so pedo-heavily clustered before. And there have been some really horrific crimes here, not to mention every week I get stories in my newsfeed about trafficking groups getting caught.  Add in that people are now even more desperate, more isolated due to CV, and it really turns into an even uglier picture. Relationships that were already fragile become explosive.  Lots of young moms on their own, willing to believe that some guy is the answer they need, and because they need that answer so badly they don't perhaps look and think about things as hard as they might have without this strong desperation and no other options situation they find themselves in. People who prey on others -not just pedos- can recognize a target easily because they are experienced, know how to groom, and are actively seeking it. It is really a problem and I'm glad I asked the question, but feel like what I got back concerns me more because now it's not just me in my head having these thoughts without outside validation. We were trained to look for ""off"" situations when I was a first responder, and required by law to report it to the right agency. But I've seen little appropriate response there when I've done so in Louisiana. I get social workers and various agency officers are overworked, especially now, but something has got to give. There isn't reasonable, basic standards mental health help here, and for whatever the reason - corrupt, overworked, IDK - it seems turning a blind eye and doing the least possible effort to at least look responsive is how it's done here.",t2_7ncx3jk7,Impressive_Degree_37,0,1612896689.0,0,t1_gmq7601,gmq7601,False,Impressive_Degree_37,t3_lfnv04,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/lfnv04/why_are_there_so_many_convicted_pedos_in_leesville/,Why are there so many convicted pedos in Leesville?,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/lfnv04/why_are_there_so_many_convicted_pedos_in_leesville/gmq7601/,1,r/CentralLouisiana,0,1

"What concerns me about the pedo thing is that, from what I understand, they can't be fixed. So to just keep churning them thru the legal system, maybe jail, and then releasing them back into the public doesn't fix anything nor address the problem of them, I suppose, being willing to take that risk, knowing they'll eventually get back out and can ""play"" again until caught.  Each time that happens, another life is ruined and families devastated. And there typically are quiet, dark web groups of these types who trade pics like they are baseball cards (maybe even trafficked ""property""). They've spent a lifetime thinking about doing it, learning how, and are basically professionals at grooming, especially in under-served, poor, and therefore vulnerable communities. Their faces and addresses are right there for anybody who might want to start a pedo club. So it's not hard for them to find one another.

They may have but eventually tree roots will grow through the pipe they have them in and they will get wet it may be a few years down the road but still it will happen. Also consider what you said you want this storm to hit Louisiana and take down the poles if a storm is strong enough to break power poles it will more than likely  uproot the 4 trees in my yard that have already started uprooting from hurricane Laura and 3 of them will hit the house. So when you whish the storm to hit hard enough to tear down all the power poles you are   indirectly wishing for my house to be destroyed.

"Honestly I'd focus on Pineville/Alexandria area for your place to live. Within 30 minutes your options are quite limited to places like Grant Parish and a few other less than desirable (to me) places. Some people like Tioga because of more space, but your mileage may vary. Most young families choose to live in the neighborhoods of Charles Park or near Jackson Street Extension, though we are seeing more families moving into the historic Garden District Neighborhood and the Postwar Suburbs area also. There are quite a few unique, historic homes that are approachable in price and the historic neighborhoods are fun and less cookie-cutter if that makes sense. If you want to be out in nature, Kincaid Lake is situated within Kisatchie National Forest and has some beautiful but somewhat pricey homes. It's about 20 minutes from town.

&#x200B;

In this region, we have ""open enrollment"" for schools meaning you don't have to be within a specific zone for your child to attend a specific public school, so that doesn't limit you much. The most popular public high schools are ASH, Pineville, and Bolton. Bolton is home to the gifted program, the arts magnet, and the AP/College Prep courses. The local LSU campus, LSUA also has a university lab school called University Academy which is receiving a lot of good recognition. There are several very popular private schools as well to include Menard, Cabrini, and Prompt Succor for parochial schools. The most popular private but secular school is ACDS or Alexandria Country Day School.",t2_bt5qk,NOLAWinosaur,0,1591893772.0,0,t1_ftpm7wq,ftpm7wq,True,cajunsaints,t3_h12pit,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/h12pit/best_area_to_live/,Best Area to Live,/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/h12pit/best_area_to_live/ftpm7wq/,3,r/CentralLouisiana,0,3

I have read some of these comments. The podcast keeps repeating themselves because of trying to explain how much these detectives utterly failed this girl and her family without compromising the ongoing investigation. At the same time they are trying to put her story out to get help to help these people get justice for Courtney. I am a mother and if this was my child I would be doing the same stuff. They are trying their best to help this case. It does not matter what happened in her past. What matters is that her life was taken and that she was a young human being whose case was never even tried to be solved.,t2_68uytybo,RelativeQuail7,0,1587224356.0,0,t1_fnslzxa,fnslzxa,True,[deleted],t3_dpjx4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/dpjx4x/courtney_coco_murder_unsolved_or_solved/,"Courtney Coco Murder Unsolved, or Solved?",/r/CentralLouisiana/comments/dpjx4x/courtney_coco_murder_unsolved_or_solved/fnslzxa/,1,r/CentralLouisiana,0,1
