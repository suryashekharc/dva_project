"Disclaimer: This is coming from the perspective of a squeaky clean BYU student. Take it with the corresponding grain of salt.

1) There's really not a bubble. It's just extremely high demand. I agree with other people about pricing for a house for rent, which is going to be your best option unless you're coming from a house. With the right down payment, anything is possible. You shouldn't have any difficulty finding a rental place as an unmarried couple.

2) There's not a huge market in Provo for vape products, but it seems to be steady for those that are in the market. Obviously, with the pandemic things are a little crazy, but that's true for any job.

3) It's the same as anywhere. Most people will have more conservative beliefs and some people are willing to talk about them till the cows come home. Most people keep to themselves about it. Just remember that here, a lot of people are specifically conservative because of their dedication to their faith. There's a moral conviction about things like abortion.

In terms of political jokes and humor, make sure you know your audience before you speak about things that could be sensitive. Making fun of the President could be okay or not depending on the group. Bashing the State Legislature is almost always fair game.

Basically, most workplaces should be fine. If you can tell you don't agree with the general sentiment of a conversation, mention that you don't feel comfortable talking about that subject and leave it at that. People are nice and will usually meet respect with respect.

4) If you want nightlife, you won't find it in Utah County. Almost everything is closed by midnight. Of course with the pandemic, everything like that is closed right now, but it won't get much better for most places in Utah County after restrictions lift. Although admittedly I'm not the best person to ask about bar spots, being a squeaky clean church boy.

Something you should remember is that because most places in Provo are closed by midnight, we've come up with other ways of having fun on our own. Lots of people like having game nights or movie nights. You'll be invited. Enjoy it, they're fun!

Lots of people here don't drink, so instead of drowning our sorrows in booze, we do it with ice cream and hamburgers, which means you'll find some absolutely fantastic burger joints in Utah. The state has more unique hamburger restaurants per capita than anywhere else in the world.

You may be invited to come to church. If you aren't interested, just say so, but know that people that invite you to church do so because they like you and want to invite you to get to know them better. The Church can sometimes seem like an insular community, and in some ways, it is, just because there's a lot of things to do. When someone invites you to church or to a church event like a cookout, it's a sign that they're interested in getting to know you better as a friend. If you're invited to a cookout or something like that, it's really just an opportunity to show up, eat some food, and socialize. You don't have to worry about being preached to at an activity.

"To clarify, you're living in Provo. Working in Provo? Or living elsewhere working in Provo?  

And as far as getting along with people. I personally don't have many issues with people. Generally *most* people are respectful. More so from my peers. I get along well with everybody. It's typically The older people that immediately react poorly to my tattoos. 

As far as dating. It shouldn't be *too* difficult to find someone to date. Although the culture here is more, they're looking to marry rather than just date. But I can't really speak for the ladies, as I'm a guy. And I don't really have good luck dating, so I'm not very helpful here. 

For reference, I'm a 25yo male with tattoos. Sometimes people talk to me, sometimes they don't. Most people don't *immediately seem* to have an issue with me. Be polite, usually they're polite back. 
And I guess, be mindful of your language if you swear a lot. Some people don't mind it, but generally speaking. Most people (in Utah valley, Provo/Orem especially) can't handle it.

"In my experience, mormon neighbors are generally polite, but also very much an in group.

I'm having trouble with my kids being raised in such a mormon-normative place and hearing mormon ideals all day from their friends and teachers.

I'm part of a local post-mormon group. Several ""never-mos"" have joined the group to have a place to hang out and things to do where they are not surrounded by mormons. That might be worth looking in to for social & dating opportunities.

"1. I live in a house with 5 other singles. Housing might be hard to find at times, but its available and you just need to look. Dont be afraid to look at houses for rent. Or even basements of houses. Im anti apartment, because we like music and we like our music loud. 
2. There are plenty of vape and smoke shops around here that he could pitch sales too, also Salt lake county has a good market for that. have him check Ralphs vapor in provo or orem, and Vapor Logic. Imagine real peace and Starry night smoke shop. Brandon as Imagine Real peace can sometimes seem like he is angry or hates your guts, but he just has a unique personality.. He is really a good guy with a great taste in music, Idk what I would do without his shop.
3. First, yes there are a lot of religious people in Utah County, but there are also TONS of non-religious, ex- religious and open-minded people in Utah County. Expect to be stared at or treated strangely by some super religious folk.. anywhere you go in any state or city, you will be treated the same by extreme religious people. There are people here who are strong in their religious faith but also treat people with kindness and open-mindedness. So dont expect to be treated wrong by ALL of them, once people see that you are kind, you will be treated with kindness.. besides by the usuals: Power trippers, bullies, psychos ect.. again.. its the same as any job you would have anywhere. Also remember it will depend on where you are working, there are some places here that will be filled with coworkers who are all apart of the same religion, and ive been there, its kind of awkward,  but there are always those few mediators in their group who are very open-minded.

"Hi! Provo is a great place to live. I’d agree that 1800-2000 is what you should expect for a non apartment rental that’s in good shape. They can be had for cheaper but you’ll make trade offs. 

I can’t speak to the vape scene, specifically. 

I am not Mormon and live here in a house that I own with my boyfriend. We have great neighbors, good jobs, and a good quality of life, which is heightened by the outdoor opportunities here - it’s a great place to ski, hike, camp, ride motorcycles - you name it. 

Utah is a great place to live, though it requires some adjusting.

"So I only just moved here and am living in an apartment so hopefully someone can answer your housing questions from actual experience/firsthand knowledge... I will say if you're renting it's really tough to find housing that ""allows"" pets, and typically it will cost you about $50 extra a month per pet. 

As far as working in the vape industry, I'd say that would be probably the biggest hurdle due to the Utah Clean Air Act which in short prohibits smoking/vaping inside or around enclosed public spaces and buildings or within 25 feet of such areas. This includes the vape shops themselves and even in your personal vehicle in certain areas. I'm honestly not sure how vape shops stay in business, or if they are able to. Online companies are prohibited from shipping products into the state as well, and any transaction involving tobacco/nicotine/vape products most be a face to face transaction. In July this year the legal age to purchase will increase to 20, and then increase to 21 in July of next year. https://rules.utah.gov/publicat/code/r392/r392-510.htm

"The market is going nowhere but up. Not really an artificial bubble since the demand is so high, people keep moving here. Rent's probably going to cost in the 1800 ballpark. For that, ld recommend looking at buying your own place. The vineyard area is booming. Keep Orem in mind in your search for housing as it's pretty much just an extension of Provo. 

Hard to gauge the vape interest in Provo. Definitely more of a Salt Lake thing, Provo is very conservative, but also very normal. people are generally respectful and keep to themselves. 

Also I'd avoid looking at properties anywhere around BYU. The student housing crisis has made that market all sorts of jacked up. 

Also, check out the food scene downtown! Provo's got tons of great places to eat. I highly recommend Black Sheep Cafe, and K's Kitchen if you like Japanese.",t2_j86pp,water_bender,0,1583300627.0,0,t1_fjfuhna,fjfuhna,True,[deleted],t3_fd76nt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProvoUtah/comments/fd76nt/considering_taking_a_position_in_the_area/,Considering taking a position in the area,/r/ProvoUtah/comments/fd76nt/considering_taking_a_position_in_the_area/fjfuhna/,5,r/ProvoUtah,0,5

"Look for ""Houses for rent"" in Provo. Do no limit your search to apartments or basements, you would be surprised what you can find in Provo and Orem if you keep looking. Especially if you are willing to add another person to pay for rent. Roommates are always a good option if you want to save some money to get your own place, if you are wanting to live alone then it will be much harder, but not impossible. 

&#x200B;

We used to live in South Provo, me and 3-4 other people in one of those small houses. I think rent was around 1100-1200$. The house was big enough that even if you and your husband lived upstairs, you would hardly see or hear the other person who might have the basement for example. The house was small enough that rent was cheap. Had its own yard, and those neighborhoods are generally quiet. 

&#x200B;

Those houses are always bought by people who deliberately rent them out to new families or singles. I was in a mixed neighborhood of families, and singles.

&#x200B;

People also rent out those basements for much cheaper than that. The house we were in had another kitchen in the basement and a separating door. 

&#x200B;

Since Provo has changed its renter laws to avoid frat houses, Renters are probably a bit more careful about who they are renting out too, but it really only hurt singles. A married couple and maybe a +1 wont be a problem for you. 

&#x200B;

My advise for you is to not be picky. Dont be afraid of roomates, even if you have had a bad experience, not all people are the same, shop around for people like you would a house. 

Dont be afraid to look for actual houses.

&#x200B;

Me and 5 other people got a sweet dig in Orem right be state street and 8th north, for 1500$ 2 floors, 5 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 1800 sq ft, one car garage, 1/3 acre, in a culdesac and a fairly good sized driveway for 2 or 3 other cars.   The owner had passed away, and his kid took over the house but lived in a different state, and just wanted to rent it out till he good renovate and sale. He really just needed to pay for property taxes, and have someone take care of the yard because of the city laws. So it was a sweet deal for us.

So there is always someone somewhere renting out something that is too good to be true, because of something going on in their life. If we got 3 of these kinds of rents in the last 5 years, you can too.",t2_157tsogd,s0nder369thOughts,0,1581492993.0,0,t1_fhdnpoh,fhdnpoh,True,haybalers,t3_f2my1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProvoUtah/comments/f2my1a/married_housing_non_byu/,Married housing non byu,/r/ProvoUtah/comments/f2my1a/married_housing_non_byu/fhdnpoh/,3,r/ProvoUtah,0,3

"Glad there were lots of friendly people - that lady (Brenda?) and the old police officer definitely should have approached the man filming with a friendlier demeanor. I think it is important to try and ensure the government isn't abusing power or violating people's rights, so doing audits like this seems like a good idea to keep people honest.

I thought it was funny though when the filmer said ""Bingo"" after the lawyer asked why he was filming. He made it seem like it's some horrible thing to ask why someone is filming in a situation where doing so is unusual. He was in a public place, but it was just outside their offices so I think it is perfectly reasonable to be wondering why someone is filming there.

"She grew up in OK and likes to fondly remember all the storms. You know...the kind that barge in and you aren’t sure if you’ll still have a house by the time it’s gone. But home insurance is SO much cheaper around here! Almost half of what we were paying in Oklahoma!
Another thing that threw me off is just how friendly and trusting everybody is here. People at coffee shops just leave laptops at the table when going to the bathroom, and it’s still there when they come back! My neighbors have left camping stuff in their front yard for a week and nobody stole it, or even damaged it! You may have a little different vibe in high density housing, and it’s good to at least be aware of possible religious undertones in social interactions, but almost everybody around here has been very good to us.

"1) [Rentler](https://www.rentler.com/places-for-rent/ut/provo/?minprice=600&maxprice=1000&minbedrooms=2) is your friend for Utah County (Provo area). That link I provided has search parameters for $600 to $1000. There appears to be quite a few options in that range. That should filter out the student and shared apartment housing (mostly). There are A LOT of new rentals in the area that will be higher in price. The price range you're interested in may be older units / basement apartments but there are still a lot that are going to be nice. I guess you just need to decide if you want granite countertops and new paint. There are so many people in the area looking for roommates you can definitely get that cost cheaper if that's something you're willing to do.  


If your work is in North Provo, you can find a lot of great options in Orem as well (maybe even Pleasant Grove if you don't mind a little longer drive). If it happens to be South Provo, I'd look at Springville as other options for renting as well. Springville is significantly cheaper, but keep in mind it's a bit redneckish as well in some parts, but if you don't care about that, then it's totally fine.  


2) Finding friends around here at your age should be just fine. You will most likely have a lot of single people your age at your job you can start the search from there. If you are a non-shy type, get a gym membership at Vasa Fitness or one of the Crossfit gyms and just start chatting with people there and getting involved with their friend circles.   


At Southworth Hall on Center Street there is Country Swing dancing and Latin dancing. There is Blues dancing somewhere in Provo as well as another Latin Dancing club. Keep in mind those places have a lot of the under graduates there too, but if you try enough you'll run into the other people.   


Check out Velour if you like local music.   


3) I don't live in Provo anymore, I live in Lehi about 20 miles north. However  I lived there long enough to had really enjoy my time  there. The food scene is pretty fun for such a small area. People are incredibly friendly, the downtown area always has something going on when it comes to art walks or festivals. The city is investing a lot into the area so it feels newer then it is. And there is enough to do in the area that it's just fun.  


Understand that you'll be in a very young town with a lot  of mormons who are nice but sometimes stick  to  themselves, and you'll probably do just fine.",t2_1d4ptxxj,eric24pete,0,1574110973.0,0,t1_f7zhz6o,f7zhz6o,True,GodLemon,t3_dxxnqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProvoUtah/comments/dxxnqv/relocating_to_provoorem/,Relocating to Provo/Orem,/r/ProvoUtah/comments/dxxnqv/relocating_to_provoorem/f7zhz6o/,3,r/ProvoUtah,0,3

"I love the area! Easy access to outdoor activities, and lots of local events to enjoy. There are enough people who have transplanted to Utah that there's always something new and exciting to eat or experience. It's also a quick commuter train ride into SLC for concerts, the symphony, a museum, food, dates, whatever. Honestly, my favorite thing about the area is the non-driving access to SLC. If you're nerdy at all, we have a truly amazing convention in FanX at the Salt Palace in September. 

I was in my mid-20's when I moved here as a non-Mormon. I pretty quickly made friends at my local workplace. While most of them were LDS, I found that they also were very accepting of the fact that I wasn't. Not everyone was, but you'll find your people. Go to local events that spark your interest. I find that people are often willing to talk. I know that Hogle Zoo also has some sort of education thing they do where they do group events out in nature at different places.

"Hi! I’m a non-Mormon person living in Provo. I love this town. It’s different for sure, but it’s safe and clean and there’s a ton to do outside if that’s your thing. 

1. It’s going to be more than MO here for what you’re living in, but there are a lot of different options, ranging from a lot of basement apartments to new condos (which are overpriced imo). 

2. There is a bunch of stuff to do outside, and I’ve found it’s a good way to meet people. I’ve made friends at the owl bar at Sundance after skiing, and go to SLC occasionally and have met people there. It’s 45 minutes north, but lots of great food and bars up there.

"1) I think you're going to be a tad hard pressed to find that kind of apartment at that price. You're probably looking at 1000 as the base for that size, although you could definitely find an apartment at that price, it'd just likely be a bit smaller. It's a college area with BYU and UVU nearby so sharing is probably a much more readily available option than other areas if that's something you're interested in.

2) That totally depends. The Provo/Orem area is going to be heavily Mormon/LDS. Not to say they won't be your friend and accept you as part of their circle or anything, but many won't be willing to date outside of the religion. Regardless of that, there are still tons of people to meet in that age bracket, in and out of the religion -- tons of college graduates still in the area. I think the best way to meet new people depends on your interests. There are tons of sports leagues, clubs, events, or what have you to find people to hang out with. There's definitely not a dearth of ways to find people to be friends with out here.

3) There are a bunch of things I like about the area. The mountains are a huge plus. You're just a 20 minute drive away from being in the mountains. During the spring and fall, it's just absolutely gorgeous up there. If you're outdoorsy, that alone can be enough to draw people here (along with several ski resorts within driving distance). Housing is still pretty cheap down here, although the closer you get the SLC, the more expensive housing gets. It's kind of the sweet spot for being near the city, but not paying a premium in housing for it. Personally for me, I'm in the tech industry and there are so many jobs in that sector here that if I were to ever lose my job for whatever reason, I would have no problem finding another. It's most if not all of the benefits of Silicon valley without the high cost of living.

4 seasons and a much more bearable winter here. Our snow is dry and melts fast. We rarely get below 0. And motorcycling, skiing, fishing, and hiking EVERYWHERE.

"1.	The restaurant scene is very up and coming, and I mean that in the best way. I’m sure you’ll  find lots of options. There’s also a Sprouts grocery store in Orem. 
2.	Lots of Mormons in the area, but also a lot of people that aren’t. Not really an issue except most of the legislature is, so laws around alcohol are a little weird. 
3.	Honestly, not but of a bar scene in the area. SLC is just 30-40 minutes away and does have a good scene. Locally, ABGs in Provo is nice. Also really like driving to Sundance and going to the Owl Bar there. 
4.	Definitely have all 4 seasons in full force. 
5.	LOADS of options when it comes to the outdoors. Utah also has 5 national parks all about 3-4 hours away.  Mentioning Sundance, that place is lovely year round with good skiing in the winter and mountain biking in summer.

The BYU whitewater club, which I'm part of, will be doing a roll practice session next Friday at the Provo pool from 8-10 PM. If you join the BYUWKC Facebook, you can arrange to rent gear for the session. The season is pretty much over for actual boating, but some classic local spots include a section of the Provo river, some of the Weber river, and the Ogden river for more advanced boaters. If you go farther out, there's plenty of boating near Moab. There's also Wyoming runs like the Grays river and Alpine Canyon of the Snake. The Idaho runs skew more towards multiday (stretches of the Salmon, the Lochsa) but there's also smaller runs like the Portneuf.

I would generally avoid Provo, certainly the area S from 1230 N. UVX has destroyed the road system in that area making it nearly impossible to drive there. Plus almost everything in that area is BYU housing anyway.

There are a number of (way too many) high density housing projects going in so finding something shouldn't be a problem.  The ones near BYU and UVU are, typically, full of students. If you look at the complexes out in the old Geneva Steel area (west of Orem starting about 400 S in Orem and going North) you will see lots of apartments there.

"It's true that thinking about reckless scooter riders is stressful and adds to the complication of driving around the city.

However, it's incredibly important that we promote methods of personal transportation which aren't full size vehicles that spend most of their time parked, and full size vehicles take up way too much road space.

It's true that this transition period is going to be a bit rough: there's not enough bike lanes, there's not any established rider etiquette or parking best practices, but we cannot allow progress to be halted simply because it's imperfect.

"Let's do some basic math. Let's assume you could pack 100 people on each of those UVX buses. Let's further assume that every single bus is full every trip. I think you'll agree that this is well above the reality of current (or realistically, potential) ridership of UVX.

They run 49 buses each day, each way. Let's just make that 100 trips for easy math.  So that's 100 people per bus \* 100 trips per day or about 10000 riders per day.

The population of Orem is \~98K, and Provo is \~117K for a total of 215K.  I'm going out on a limb and saying that 10K out of 215K is a small percentage (less than 5%). And that assumes every single bus is packed with 100 people which they are not. Actual ridership is well below 1% probably below 0.01% of the population. So yes, UVX benefits a tiny fraction of the population.

&#x200B;

The tiny fraction of the population that UVX does benefit is a direct result of very poor (I would say grossly negligent and incompetent) ""planning"" on the part of the state (UVU), Orem city, Provo city, and BYU. No one at any of these organizations gave two seconds thought about transportation, pollution, etc. Any class of 2nd graders could do better city planning around BYU and UVU than either of our city councils or city planning folks have done. Anyone who has played Sim City for more than 5 minutes is better qualified.

&#x200B;

Now let's look at ""taking cars off the road."" While some might ride UVX vs other modes of transit, that doesn't mean every rider is not driving a car. I'm old enough to remember when many in Provo walked or road bikes. So many riders have substituted a non polluting form of transit (human power) for a polluting form (UVX). That's not better, that's worse for the environment.

Plus, all the stupid road closures and medians installed for UVX are causing those who do drive cars to spend more time on the road with more engine hours (and hence more pollution). For example, my trip to the Provo library was several blocks longer (7 blocks vs. 2 or roughly 1/2 a mile) than it needed to be because of senseless medians on University avenue and 700 N.

&#x200B;

Also, you can hop on facebook and just look under the events tab to see who is holding events tonight or this week or whatever in your local area. Sometimes you can find little house shows and other things that way.

LDS Ward facebook pages are another good way to stay informed for things like slip n slides in the park, pickup games of ultimate or volleyball, boating trips, etc. If you are or are not a member of the LDS faith, you can still ask your neighbors about joining the ward FB page and they should be able to help you out.

"Are you daft? I don't want to deal with something. That is completely my right at the owner/manager of my property. Are you saying I should inconvenience myself to appease someone else's desire to have a domesticated wolf friend in a carpeted home? Sorry if I seem upset but you come across as siding with the pet owner without regard to someone who is having to deal with their damage. 

I'm a drummer and I don't expect to force neighbors to deal with my noise if they don't want to so I don't living in an apartment and drum all day. I buy a house and enjoy what I want without causing concern to someone else. If I wanted a dog, I would buy a home and not leave it to someone else to deal with my damage/wear and tear, even if I pay for the parts and labor and a little extra.

And yet I still allow pets after all the problems that I have had to deal with. 

I would hope you can sympathize with me. I am not some huge apartment complex with hundreds of units and a cold hearted legal team that will chase after deposits and damage fees. I'm just a guy who has put sweat equity into doing my own home repairs and treating renters right. I don't appreciate that you come back after I try to answer questions with my relevant experience and say ""you'd rather not deal with it, that doesn't make it right.""

I'm not trying to be a self-centered individual. I share my homes even if it just breaks even my expenses. I want to give people a good deal and a smooth/easy time living and leaving my property. But I have limits on what I would want to deal with so others like yourself should have a little more respect for my time and wishes. I am not a faceless slumlord.

"I don't ban dogs in my properties. I do have deposits in place and contractual agreements to all for full responsibility of pet damage to owners.

Combine this with a lack of responsibility when a pet owner may try to argue that the pet tearing up the yard is normal wear and tear. Then when it would take hours of labor, and hundreds or thousands of dollars to get things back to how they were before the pet damage, this just turns into a hassle that I would prefer not to deal with. even if I get full reimbursement for sod and laborers, I still have to deal with the time of finding, hiring, and supervising that the job is done correctly and the hassle of having the property look like a construction zone until everything is fixed under repair. Finally I could incur some significant loss of rental income if people move out, I inspect to find damage, and have days or weeks of not being able to show the home to new tenants while the damage is being sorted. 

I would rather not sign up for the extra headache even if the money can solve the materials and labor part of the eqation. Scenario A - Renters with no pets, no chance for pet damage
Scenario B - Renters with pets, chance for pet damage, chance to have them argue over their deposit or additional damage charges, time to find the right people and manage until the job is finished, potential vacancy time while work is being done. All that is not ideal and Id rather have no pets, no pet deposit, and no potential extra work.

Good question.  When the parade reaches the divided road, each entry will alternate one going on the East side and the next going on the West side and so on through out the parade.  In this way, there will not be one side that gets the parade and one side that does not.  Both sides of the street will have an equal view of the parade.  Hope to see you at the parade Brent.

"""Lane filtering"" aka ""motorcycle privilege"" is a terrible idea. It's perfectly safe and reasonable to open your car door, for example, while stopped.  It's also reasonable to change lanes while traveling slowly towards an intersection.  Both of these could be fatal for a motorcyclist passing between cars.

&#x200B;

Motorcycles whipping between cars at or above the posted speed limit is not safe. It's not intelligent. It shouldn't be allowed.

&#x200B;

I contacted my legislators and repeatedly expressed concerns about the dangers of passing this silly law to no avail.

&#x200B;

Only 5% of motorcycle vs. vehicle crashes are cars hitting the motorcycle from the rear. 78% are from the front. ""Lane filtering"" is solving a problem that doesn't exist by allowing a much more dangerous practice. It isn't about safety (despite propaganda from UHP & others), it's about privilege.

Our son regularly roams the block around our house and will play with anyone and everyone who will play with him. His friends are either kids from school or those he runs into around the neighborhood; I imagine simply by coincidence many are LDS, but most of them I have no idea whether they are or not.

As for public schools having an agenda, I'm not sure exactly what sort of agenda you're referring to but I've been to parent-teacher meetings, I've seen plenty of his schoolwork, never noticed anything that seemed outside the context of a normal, secular education you'd find anywhere else.

"Improv Broadway and Comedysportz are a good way to get your comedy fill on the weekends. Improv Broadway does more long form improv and musicals, and comedysportz does short form (similar to who’s line is it anyway). Dry Bar brings in some good B list stand up comedians, but it’s not constantly running, so check their website first. Someone else mentioned the rooftop concert series, that’s a free outdoor concert once a month on center street, always super fun. Utah County used to, and I think still does, have the highest restaurants per capita in the nation. So as far as food goes, you have tons of options (though admittedly, quantity does not mean quality.) one of my favorites is Joes Cafe on orem state street. I also like hitting up food truck round up on thursdays by the startup building.

"Since it’s a Mormon area, there really isn’t a bar scene to meet people. So, hot tub hopping is something that is popular in Provo. There are so many apt complexes that have pools and hot tubs where people hangout (usually at night). I have made some friends that way.

I don’t know if you plan on living alone or with other roommates, but I met most of my friends in Provo by being roommates with them.

Similar story: Grew up in Northern California, finally broke it off with my fiancé (long story) and moved to Utah for the same reasons (did not want to see her dating my friends (smallish town).

Moved to Utah. Quite the culture shock. I was not a fan (still am not).

What saved me?

I discovered the trails of Utah. Became a runner, found out that there are thousands of miles of trail. Gorgeous, intimidating mountains.

There is a whole subset of people here who try to spend all their free time running these trails. I’m now one of them. I came to get away from some pretty deep heartache, but stayed because I feel in love with Utah’s topology.

Provo is a young, lds college town. And I mean super young, cuz it's undergrads only 95% of the time. Probably 80% of the demographic is like younger than 25. You're in a tough spot right now. It's easy to see the bad side of things. Try and stay positive and put yourself out there a bit if you're looking for friends. Easiest way to do it is to get involved in some groups or communities. Whatever your hobbies are, look for groups that like to do meet ups and activities together. Lame advice, but it's always the easiest and most natural way for me to make friends.
