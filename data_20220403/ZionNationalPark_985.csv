"Hi, so the way we just did it was, we found the first day available in September that was exactly 6 months apart. 

We picked two weeks, even though it's six month rolling, as long as the first day is available.  Two weeks is the longest time you can book.

Then we waited until 10am Eastern time and had it all set up to just ""Add to Cart"".

So, for example, we chose a spot that was available on Sept 12, which was 6 months from yesterday.  Then I picked the two weeks, which it lets you do.  Then, I waited until 8am or time, 10 am Eastern, to Add to Cart.  

Let me clarify a few things.  This is hard to do because Watchman is so popular.  If you don't want to stay two weeks, then cancel the days your don't want ,after 17 days from the initial reservationi (f you're lucky to get the spot).  It cost $10 to cancel or change reservations.

It took us three days of trying.  I had the best spot ready to go on my phone.  Then my husband and I had two laptops ready with 4 different tabs set up with 8 alternate sites.

Luckily, the phone seemed faster and I got our first pick.  They are all gone in a matter of a minute or two.

It's really the only way to do it.  You do have to be somewhat flexible on your camping dates.

Good luck!  It was a pain!

Let me know if you need clarification.",t2_15jwenad,sepstolm,0,1647196051.0,0,t1_i0iqn00,i0iqn00,True,ararefiend,t3_sgdh04,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/sgdh04/watchman_campground_reservations/,Watchman Campground Reservations,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/sgdh04/watchman_campground_reservations/i0iqn00/,1,r/ZionNationalPark,0,1

Yes bring them for sure. There was some small ice on the switchback on the way up. We didn’t use ours for that( very easy to avoid ). There was about 4 or 5 icy spots on Angles landing part. Me and my 12 year old wore spikes( mostly for caution) my 25 year old nephew didn’t wear them and had no issues. That’s all subject to change of course when you go but I would definitely have them in the bag just in case. Unbelievable experience. My wife could t go with me so I think I’m taking her back next week. We live in Florida but it’s worth the trip. I can’t imagine her missing out on this.

"We're planning for early week of May. 
We're not fit,  but,  will challenge ourselves.
For comparison, we did hike Diamondhead in Hawaii in 3 hrs.

If shuttle is too consuming, we rather ""challenge"" ourselves with renting tandem bicycles (not sure where to rent)

Is it too much to ride bicycle thru Zion for unfit people like us?

If not will attempt to go take rental car to visitor center or wherever its allowed bring car in May

"Read descriptions in [Joes Guide](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/recommend.php) - Pa'rus, Riverside Walk, Grotto, Timber Creek overlook, a few others.  Emerald Pools might be too long and Canyon Overlook might have too many steps but read the descriptions and decide for yourself.  There are a lot of pull outs and overlooks along UT9 from east entrance to Springdale entrance.

Note that the shuttles will not be running if you're there during a weekday on the first week of March.  They only [run weekends until March 13th](https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm).  No tickets are needed for the shuttle but you could end up standing in line for long periods of time.  Benches nearby to rest, if needed. 

If you are there during a weekday in the first week of March, you are allowed to drive your private/rental vehicle on the scenic drive.  Parking is limited, so get going early or wait till traffic dies down in the afternoon.  The shuttle didn't stop at the Court of the Patriarchs last year and there's a nice short easy hike there in addition to what already has been listed.

Consider maybe renting an ebike for Pa'rus and peddling the main scenic canyon.  Somewhat pricey but depending on how limited the mobility is, could be a great option to see Zion Canyon along the entire scenic road.

Someone mentioned the scenic drive in Valley of Fire SP in NV.  I second that recommendation.  Also might want to check into [Grafton Ghost Town](https://www.americansouthwest.net/utah/zion/grafton_ghost_town.html) if that interest.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1644330432.0,0,t1_hw32cef,hw32cef,True,Hopeful_Instance5542,t3_smf2tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/smf2tw/first_time_visiting_with_disabled_mother/,First time visiting with disabled mother (recommendations),/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/smf2tw/first_time_visiting_with_disabled_mother/hw32cef/,1,r/ZionNationalPark,0,1

"You MUST checkout Valley of Fire state park in Nevada on the way up. The cut off is about 45 minutes north of Vegas on i15, the park probably around another 30 more minutes. It takes around 40 minutes to do the scenic drive and is breathtaking. You can exit on the other side of the park and continue on to i15 via the north entrance to the park so as not to backtrack. Definitely worth the little detour. 

Also for zion keep in mind that the shuttle will only be operating on the weekends of March 5/6 and 12/13. So if you go on one of those weekends you must use the shuttle and I strongly advise to purchase your tickets well in advance for it. If you go midweek you can drive your own vehicle into the valley which is awesome, but you will want to arrive fairly early in the day (2.5 hour drive from vegas) because if the canyon fills up they will block it off a little ways in until the traffic that is in there starts to leave, from which point they only allow in a few cars here and there and you have no idea when that will happen. I went last Friday and got to the park by 10:30 am and was fine. They never ended up blocking it off that day because it was fairly quiet that day but I wouldn’t count on that.

"Was in Zion jan 27/28 (came from Vegas)- there hadn’t been any recent precipitation in the days leading up to it so the road conditions as far as slick or ice were not an issue. I thought all of the roads were beautiful and well maintained. I actually kept commenting on how the nice all the roads were so smooth and well marked. Someone the other day said to me yeah like roads in all national parks lol (Clearly I am newer to national parks if this is a known thing LOL) but still I was impressed. As far as steepness, there are some drives such as headed to the overlook Canyon Trail head that work its way up to a tunnel that have some switchbacks and if you don’t like driving near edges of cliffs could be nerve-racking. But scenic drive itself is very easy well-maintained relatively straight and not too dangerous. I suffer from very severe motion sickness. I always have to drive or I absolutely get sick and even when I drive usually in the mountains, I still get a little bit sick (cbd helps so much with this FYI) I didn’t experience any issues with that at all especially on the Scenic Canyon Drive. I thought this was a very accessible place to all trail heads. So obviously that could change depending on what weather comes through before your trip but I felt safe and secure with all the routes we drove.",t2_daex0lpn,nange216,0,1644079865.0,0,t1_hvpslh9,hvpslh9,True,Mtom-96,t3_slage2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/slage2/driving_through_zion_at_end_of_february/,Driving through Zion at end of February,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/slage2/driving_through_zion_at_end_of_february/hvpslh9/,2,r/ZionNationalPark,0,2
"I did a decent amount of research on this hike and nothing really stood out to me as needing to pack extra safety gear. For the most part the route of the hike and back is easy to follow bc there’s really only one direction to go and come back. Other than the one major split at orderville canyon there aren’t other routes to venture out in. I was most concerned with being warm, so I had some extra layers and gloves. I did bring a camelback so had like 1.5 of water, although I didn’t drink as much as I should of. I always hike with a pocket knife just in case and a few other things like bandaids and so forth. We did bring plenty of snacks for energy bc you expend a lot walking through the water. Maybe I was more lax then I needed to be but I think being prepared for cold, knowing the general trail map, the canyon split and all that is important, and having the right gear are the main things imo.",t2_daex0lpn,nange216,0,1644079524.0,0,t1_hvprq2n,hvprq2n,False,nange216,t3_sgc1qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/sgc1qb/the_narrows_in_winter_bottom_up/,The Narrows in Winter (Bottom Up),/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/sgc1qb/the_narrows_in_winter_bottom_up/hvprq2n/,2,r/ZionNationalPark,0,2

"The permits for The Narrows top-down and the lottery for The Subway are not new.  And those apply to those trails only (and perhaps in a certain direction).

What is new is the lottery for Angels Landing.  Is that the part that is confusing you specifically?  For this lottery, it only applies to the hike from Scouts Lookout up to Angels Landing.  If you want to hike that, you'll need to apply for the lottery.  For an October visit, if you want to try to get an Angels Landing permit, you'll have to apply between July 1 and July 20.  Aim to specifically list the dates you want, and include multiple time slots.  So if you really want a permit on Oct. 2, perhaps enter for Oct. 2 before 9am, 9am-12pm, and after 12pm.  You'll see what I mean when you enter the lottery.  I think you can input up to 7 options.  FYI, reading the comments in this sub, the majority of people who applied for the Angels Landing lottery in the April-May timeframe did NOT get drawn.

You can be in the rest of the park, on any trail, without entering or winning one of the lotteries.",t2_2m1jjvu6,PiBrickShop,0,1643982609.0,0,t1_hvk6oij,hvk6oij,True,MrI3lue,t3_sk0svq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/sk0svq/can_someone_explain_to_me_the_lottery/,Can someone explain to me the lottery?,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/sk0svq/can_someone_explain_to_me_the_lottery/hvk6oij/,3,r/ZionNationalPark,0,3

On our way out, I noticed plenty of people who had turned back way before we did. It’s still worth the experience and every part of it is beautiful. Even if ya walk in for an hour or less in my opinion. Renting gear was invaluable for us and having a good base layer underneath. And you could always bring some extra layers in your bag if you need to change or add to. Hand warmers are also a good idea, someone had suggested putting them in the brim of my hat to keep my ears warm and that was wonderful.

No unfortunately I do not. This was my first narrows trip and that was two days ago. I have read that with snow melt the River increases and can even be closed during high flow season. I found this to be a challenging hike in the cold and even strong currents in a few spots that we took care going over that I could imagine be very difficult with higher flow. The nice thing about the narrows is you can go as far as you like and turn back at any point and it is still a rewarding beautiful hike.

IMO - I don’t think you need to arrive that early. Springdale shuttle starts running at 8 am. Park in Springdale and catch the shuttle to the park. Yes you’ll have a line for the Zion shuttle but there’s always a line for the Zion shuttle. Getting there at 6am from Kanab sounds miserable! I don’t think it’s necessary.

"A & D completely closed and so is part of B.  You can definitely get from East Entrance trailhead to either Observation Pt or Cable Mountain (or Deertrap Mountain) but that's a pretty long round trip.  It's 17 to 18 mi roundtrip to Cable and back and over 20 to Observation Point and back.  

There is [backcountry camping](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/traildescriptions.htm) on the east side: 

> This area has no established campsites. At-large dispersed camping is allowed in select areas of the East Rim, East Mesa, Cable Mountain, and Deertrap Mountain mesas. A Wilderness permit is required.

As /u/BoWeiner has stated, the hike from Stave Spring is much more interesting than from East Mesa.  You drop down for a bit into Echo Canyon and that short section around the word ""Echo"" to the ""5592"" on your map requires some very easy trail finding.  The ""C"" section is a good steady climb with great hiking and views.

To answer your question on where to start for Stave Spring, on Google Maps it's just west of the intersection of W Ponderosa Pine and South West Oak.  The roads back there can get impassable if wet from rain or snow melt and they can be pretty rutted if dry.  In particular, the last 100' to the Stave Spring trailhead is not passable by anything other than high clearance vehicle and you'll have to park on the road (don't block any driveway or the road itself).  Zion Ponderosa resort does run a shuttle out to the East Mesa trailhead for $5/person - you could ask them if they'll drop you off at Stave Spring and pick you up at East Mesa if you don't want to risk the drive on the dirt road.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1643210865.0,0,t1_huay5nc,huay5nc,False,PiBrickShop,t3_sd78do,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/sd78do/which_section_of_trail_is_closed_a_b_c_or_d_more/,"Which section of trail is closed?

"Backpacking in Zion is great! Amazing views and you can escape the hordes. A few downsides are that water can be tough to find, poop has to be carried out in a way bag, and the permitting system is atrocious for multi day trips. A few recommendations:

1. Up the west rim trail and looping around with telephone canyon trail 
2. Start from the east side and go out to deer trap and cable mountain areas 
3. Out and back around Kolob canyons area/la verkin creek
4. Backpacking the Zion narrows one way. Requires a shuttle.

"Hi! I’d recommend 3 days at Zion- a lot more to do in the area. Bryce can be easily done in 1-2 days. Theres a couple smaller/state parks that are definitely worth checking out if you have the time! 
- coral pink sand dunes state park (they have sand boarding and ATVs) ~40 min from Zion 
- red reef trail in Leeds, UT (~50 min from Zion)

"Am in Zion right now. If you are not hiking you can do the 2 scenic drives stopping frequently for pics in 4 hours or so - as long as the rangers don’t close the road due to congestion. This weekend is busy due to the MLK holiday and on both days they were restricting access from about 11:00am or so.

Bryce is about 2 hours from Zion. To do it any sort of justice you’re looking at a minimum of 6 hours. Any way you cut it it’s 4 hours of travel time plus sightseeing.

We stayed at the Desert Pearl Inn and have no complaints. King riverside room - Little expensive but it’s less than 5 mins from the main gates at Zion.

We had meals at MeMe’s Cafe and the Whiptail Grill. Both were above average. Both the chicken and steak tacos at Whiptail were fantastic.

"There's about 400 hundred parking spots total in the main canyon that can be used when the shuttles are not running.  I couldn't tell you how they're distributed but a big chunk are at the lodge and another substantial amount down by Temple of Sinawava (Riverside Walk/Narrows).

They do fill quickly, though maybe not so much this time of year.  There are some spots to park at the Grotto Picnic area (start of trail head for Angel's Landing).  If those are full, keep going to the lodge and park there if you can.  That adds maybe a flat pleasant mile walk along the Virgin to get to the Angel's Landing trail.

It would be about a five mile walk from the Visitor Center parking lots, so you probably wouldn't want to do that.  Renting a bike though and biking that five miles is certainly doable and then you'll have less worries about parking at the trail head.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1641915648.0,0,t1_hs7v1j4,hs7v1j4,True,sh00tfirst7,t3_s1fiy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/s1fiy0/parking_when_the_shuttle_is_closed/,Parking When the Shuttle Is Closed,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/s1fiy0/parking_when_the_shuttle_is_closed/hs7v1j4/,2,r/ZionNationalPark,0,2

"Just hiked Angels Landing on Saturday. For now they are allowing hikers without permits. I stood at the base of The Spine for 45 minutes debating whether or not I should go up. Ultimately I made it to the top. Honestly I would recommend you have at least Yaktrax over your hiking shoes, Microspikes would be optimal though. I went up with people wearing straight up sneakers and SANDALS and they did okay. Going down is much harder than going up due to the potential sliding and psychological barriers.

"I think the closest really great display you’re gonna see is probably in Escalante national monument. They’ve got multiple that look incredible. I haven’t been but If I remember correctly, one of their slot canyons is actually the longest in the entire world. Valley of fire state park in Nevada by the border also offers some really cool slot canyons on the white domes/seven wonders/fire wave loop trail. There might be others in the park but I didn’t have a chance to see them. If you’re coming from Vegas, valley of fire is on the way like 1.5 hours from Zion.

"Definitely go to Bryce! I did the narrows, angels landing, all of emerald pools, watchman and parus and the only one that was better than the views I saw at Bryce Canyon on the Navajo/queens garden loop was the narrows (sorry angels landing. Still awesome but overrated as hell). I think it was also because the hype angels landing gets but the lack of it that Bryce Canyon gets. It caused me to be seriously underwhelmed by angels landing and just the opposite when it came to Bryce Canyon. The Navajo/queens garden loop is a short (3 mile loop I believe?) hike that you will not regret at all. The snow makes it otherworldly. Aside from that, I’d recommend doing the watchman trail at zion and doing the scenic drive. Watchmen is fairly easy and still offers some incredible views. Very underrated.

"Last time I went to Zion I stayed at 2 different places, one up in Hurricane. I wanted to check out Kolob Canyon first thing in the morning, then I drove down and parked at the main parking lot right in the entrance. I, being from the Midwest and not over ambitious, was happy doing the Watchmen hike from the parking lot. (This was during the time you needed timed passes for the shuttle so that was a no-go for me) Great views. I am in pretty good shape but I still got hot and woozy towards the top and turned around. I did not want to get altitude sickness at the top and have to have my ass hauled down by the park service. I spent that night in Kanab. From my motel room I Google image searched to view from the top of the Watchman and felt awesomely accomplished. Happy I didn’t push myself snd satisfied with my effort and the hike.

"Since you are going with family, I would recommend staying in Springdale because it’s an easy walk or short ride into the park and you can walk to a lot of restaurants. We went in October and stayed at the Cliff Rose, which is the 2nd to last hotel before the main entrance. Less than a 5 minute walk, right along the river, and tons of room for kids to run around outside. If you are in good shape, I recommend doing the West Rim hike from Lava Point. It will take you to the Grotto and Angel’s Landing. I am in my early 40’s and in decent shape, and my wife and I did the 17 miles in 5.5 hours.

"My friends and I stayed in an Airbnb in Kanab vs Springdale and really liked it! We loved this restaurant, Sego, and would highly recommend! It’s not as close as Springdale, but was still only an hour away from the main part of the park. The geography on the east side of the park is wildly different than the canyon, and interesting to experience both! 

I was underwhelmed with Emerald pools as there’s been a draught in UT for years and thus the pools weren’t as cool looking IRL. Definitely recommend the Narrows, and exploring some hikes that don’t require a permit on the eastern side.

"Glance through [Joes Guide](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/recommend.php), if you haven't already done so.

Watchman at sunset would be a good hike.  Northgate Peaks would be a good one to get away from the crowds, though there will be areas where you get wet feet in April.  Timber Creek Overlook and Middle Fork of Taylor in the Kolob Canyons area might work for you - lots of creek crossings on the Taylor Creek hike.  Mostly just jumping or stepping on stones to cross but water flow increases during the day in April as snow melts - so, again, wet feet and a little risk with someone on your back messing with your balance.

"There are several places in Springdale that rent bikes and accessories, easy enough to find online.  They have trailers and tag-alongs (though, 20months is probably too young).  It'll run you just over $100 a day for two regular bikes and a trailer.  If you can afford to splurge, the e-bikes make the ride very easy but it's not that difficult of a pedal anyway.  Here's my cut and paste on the bike ride itself:

> It's a very moderate bike but it is steadily uphill and about 8.5 mi one-way from the visitor center to the end at Temple of Sinawava (Riverside Walk/Narrows).  It's about 5miles to the start of Angels Landing hike.  That can be a lot if it's hot and you haven't ridden a bike in 15 years for more than just around the block.

> There are a couple of spots that might gas the average person.  The first few miles from the Visitor Center to Canyon junction is flat.  Take a look at the gradient profile tool on [this page on biking the canyon](https://pjammcycling.com/climb/1537.Zion-Canyon).  Any grade 2% or less is hardly noticeable as a climb and average gradient is 1.1%.  A 5% grade (orange on the interactive gradient profile) is noticeable and there's a brief stretch about halfway from the Junction to the Zion Lodge and two short stretches between the lodge and the end - you might have to walk the bike a hundred feet or two and that's ok.  

> Average person can do this bike.  Highly recommend biking as you get to set your own agenda without waiting for shuttles, you get 360^o views the entire way without looking out windows, you can stop and rest and take in view anywhere along the route, water for refill is available at several of the shuttle stops, easy social distance the whole way, and *downhill* on the way home.

> Even if you don't bike into the canyon, you can bike the Pa'rus trail or into Springdale.  Bring a head lamp and catch the sunset along the Pa'rus near Canyon Junction.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1641320248.0,0,t1_hr8qs7b,hr8qs7b,False,TreedySBR,t3_rvu7eo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/rvu7eo/hiking_with_a_toddler/,Hiking with a toddler,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/rvu7eo/hiking_with_a_toddler/hr8qs7b/,1,r/ZionNationalPark,0,1

"Overlook has a 30ft section or so where it might be sketchy - narrow, iffy footing, longish drop if fall - where the change in balance due to the extra weight on the back might be an issue.  Quite a few stairs at the start but plenty of places to rest and some railings to help.  Should be doable, just use your best judgement when there.  Certainly be more than watchful and careful if you let the 20 month old run free.

Narrows in April has a good chance of being completely closed due to high current flow (anything greater than 150cfs).  Can still walk Riverside walk to the start of the Narrows.

"Totals: ~10 miles, ~3400ft elevation gain.

I did Angel’s Landing followed by taking the West Rim Trail up to Cabin Spring. Significant snow on the West Rim Trail on the upper portions and light snow and ice starting maybe 1/4 to 1/2 mile from the junction with Angel’s Landing. I had to break trail today and was pretty exhausted by the time I got to Cabin Spring. I was surprised I was so tired but I think it was caused by a combination of excess Christmas eating and the altitude.

I thought Angel’s Landing was a super fun trail but definitely not scary. I was expecting a lot more exposure! I tried to use the chains as little as possible to make it a little more interesting which I’d recommend if it’s not too busy. Descending was a bit of a nightmare but overall an awesome hike. I’ve done the Half Dome Cables and I think my assessment of risk and what’s scary has been changed a lot, so I can definitely understand it being terrifying to some people. Also, Angel’s Landing has some ridiculously steep switchbacks; I was impressed. 

West Rim Trail starting from the Angel’s Landing junction begins with a great viewpoint followed by a descent. There was a fun ledge section with big snowdrifts where if you slipped, you were sliding down 20-30 feet on a steep slab. Switchbacks lead up to more ledges with a few *big* 2-3 foot snowdrifts which made it quite sketchy. Those ledges were far more scary than Angel’s Landing I thought and a fall there would be absolutely devastating and probably lethal. I made it to Cabin Spring and broke trail to the upper plateau and went only a bit farther. I was tired and decided to turn around, but I was originally planning to go to the junction of West Rim Trail with Telephone Canyon Trail.",t2_c67sp6sf,MountainGoat97,0,1640665725.0,0,t1_hq8m9e2,hq8m9e2,True,MountainGoat97,t3_rq6gxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/rq6gxk/west_rim_trail_and_angels_landing_122721/,West Rim Trail and Angel’s Landing (12/27/21),/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/rq6gxk/west_rim_trail_and_angels_landing_122721/hq8m9e2/,4,r/ZionNationalPark,0,4

"Whether the conditions are safe is relative depending on your experience and familiarity with the parks and trails. I can speak to the Observation Point Trail. That trail is accessed via the East Mesa trail head of which is significantly higher in elevation than main Zion Canyon (3,300 ft) so predicted snow would be more impactful at the trailhead and throughout the hike. Access to that trailhead would most likely be difficult this year and especially with snow in the forecast for your timeframe. Consider contacting East Zion Adventures to see if the offer Trail head drop offs.

"Canyon Overlook is probably the easiest hike to a view.  As others said, wouldn't matter if the shuttles are running as the trailhead isn't on the shuttle route.  Always have to drive there.  Watchman trail from the visitor center parking lot is also a relatively easy hike to a view - good sunset hike.  West Rim trail up to Scout Lookout (spot right before Angels Landing) has great views but it's strenuous and likely icy in spots right now.  Timber Creek Overlook in the Kolob Canyons part of Zion (off of I15) is easy.  There are other hikes to views (ex: Northgate Peaks) but will have snow right now.


You can use Google satellite  map view and zoom in to get a better idea on the Canyon Overlook parking.  This is [the parking lot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canyon+Overlook+Trail,+Utah+84737/@37.2132504,-112.9410137,18z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80cac319b8f3a5e3:0xf7e72910f359cdd6) just as you exit the tunnel.  You have to cross the highway right there to get to the trail and stairs.  Pretty obvious when you're there and, of course, watch traffic.  The [triangular shaped pullout](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canyon+Overlook+Trail,+Utah+84737/@37.2141075,-112.9404115,17z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80cac319b8f3a5e3:0xf7e72910f359cdd6) is just down the road a bit on the other side right at the first curve in the road.  The parking lot often is full no matter the time of day and you might have to park in a nearby pullout on the right side or do a u-ey and park in that triangular pullout (or other pullout) and walk a few hundred extra meters to the start of the trail.  You should also drive the entire length of UT9 to the east entrance - very scenic with a lot of pullouts - either before or after you do Canyon Overlook.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1640283504.0,0,t1_hppl2m2,hppl2m2,True,VerboseWraith,t3_rmyxnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/rmyxnl/hello_i_had_a_quick_question_on_how_to_access_the/,"Hello!

It's a five mile one-way walk to trail head for Angels, six to the lodge, and 8.5 to end of road.  Pets are allowed on the Zion Lodge grounds but I'm not sure how you'd get there as they're not allowed on the shuttles and I don't think the lodge allows overnight pets and, as I've said, it's a long walk.

There are a lot of pullout with scenery in the other parts of the park along Kolob  Canyon Rd, Kolob  Terrace Rd, and UT9 Zion-Mt Carmel Hwy from Springdale to East Entrance.  

Up to you if that's enough for a worthwhile trip.  You might want to check out the UT state parks instead.  They're much more dog friendly - Snow Canyon, Coral Pink Sand Dunes, Quail Creek, Sand Hollow, Kodachrome Basin, Goblin Valley, Dead Horse Point or try Escalante-Grand Staircase or national forest (Red Canyon in Dixie NF by Bryce) or BLM  or national recreation lands instead.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1639758863.0,0,t1_hoxp2xv,hoxp2xv,True,Anchors_and_Ales,t3_riknck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/riknck/dog_friendly/,Dog friendly?,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/riknck/dog_friendly/hoxp2xv/,3,r/ZionNationalPark,0,3

"I hike in running shoes with a lower stack height and I don’t have any issues. A lot of my hikes are on trails with a lot of rocks, roots, and steps to go up or down made of rocks and wood. Part of the time I am rocks way bigger than myself and my shoes have great traction. Zero twisted ankles. I live in Colorado and have been hiking for years if this helps.

I hiked half dome in mid November and wore these shoes. 16 miles and 5000 feet of ascent no issues. This includes the 400 foot climb up the dome with the cables down (meaning no poles to hold the cables up).

I don’t recommend going out and buying hiking shoes or any shoes for your upcoming trip. You run more risk of them not being broken in and getting blisters. When hiking move at a speed appropriate for what is on the ground in front of you.

If there is snow that will be an issue. Wet feet and cold temperatures can be a big problem and I don’t recommend this. Feel free to ask questions here or send me a message.

"You won't need a permit for Angels Landing for this January.  Permit system starts [in April](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/angels-landing-hiking-permits.htm).

There's a possibility there will be snow at Zion Ponderosa (it's at 6500 ft elevation).  Ask them if they'll give you a ride to either Stave Spring or East Mesa trail head in January (they were doing this last summer for $5.00).  The trail heads are right by their property but the dirt roads can get sketchy.  From East Mesa, it's a relatively flat hike to one of the best views in Zion ([Observation Pt](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/east-mesa-trail-to-observation-point)).  You can get to either [Cable Mt](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/cable-mountain-via-stave-spring-trailhead#:~:text=Cable%20Mountain%20via%20Stave%20Spring%20Trailhead%20is%20a%207.7%20mile,is%20primarily%20used%20for%20hiking.) or [Deertrap](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/utah/deertrap-mountain-via-stave-spring-trailhead#:~:text=Deertrap%20Mountain%20via%20Stave%20Spring%20Trailhead%20is%20a%2010.6%20mile,is%20primarily%20used%20for%20hiking.) from Stave Spring, which also have great views but are a little more distance.  You can also get to Observation Pt from Stave Spring on a much more rugged hike than from East Mesa.  If you do decide on Zion Ponderosa and want to do a hike from East Mesa or Stave Spring, I'd call them a couple days before you head there and ask about snow conditions and forecast and, if necessary, their thoughts on [snow shoe rentals](https://www.zionponderosa.com/blog/2020/01/snowshoe-adventures-in-zion/).",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1638740829.0,0,t1_hndm5zz,hndm5zz,False,GomaN1717,t3_r8z0va,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r8z0va/new_years_eve_trip_for_first_timers_zion_is_this/,New Years Eve trip for first timers @ Zion - is this a stupid idea?,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r8z0va/new_years_eve_trip_for_first_timers_zion_is_this/hndm5zz/,1,r/ZionNationalPark,0,1

1. Assuming we wouldn't do Zion until the 2nd, is there anything else in Hurricane or St. George worth checking out on the 1st town-wise? Or are there any more mild parks to maybe check out that don't require super extensive planning?

Subway top down is excellent but you need to know canyoneering and you have to swim in very cold water.

"Haha I’m planning to bring microspikes, crampons, and snowshoes on the trip just so I’m not limited by conditions as much. I shouldn’t have to use the latter 2 much from what I understand about the parks. 

Capitol Reef seems like too much for my schedule, considering that I want to do so much in Zion. Bryce Canyon seems like I can comfortably do what I want in perhaps 1.5 full days, so I feel like I should include Bryce in my trip still. 

Is the Subway really that great of a hike? It looks I’m guaranteed to get a permit (there’s still +50 out of 60 spots available for the days I’m there). I’m not particularly wed to doing the Subway, it’s just that it seems like I can do it so I figured I should.

"A number of options for West Rim.  You could go just a mile or so past Angels before turning around.you could go to about Behunin Canyon, go to Cabin Spring, or do the full lollipop Telephone Canyon back to Cabin Spring.  You'll really have to see what trail conditions are like if you decide to go all the way to Cabin Spring (pack microspikes?).  That stretch from Behunin to Cabin Spring is like 1000 ft elevation gain on a trail essentially cut into the cliff.  That time a year, 1000 ft difference in elevation can be a big difference in trail condition.

UT12 from Bryce to Capitol Reef is spectacular but you go over 9000 ft Boulder Pass.  I'd be reluctant to take it even if I knew current conditions were good.  You might have to take I15 instead.  It's extremely difficult to get a BLM permit for The Wave but there's that and other hikes down by Kanab / Big Water (wire pass/buckskin gulch for example) and lower elevation so less worry about snow.

"That would not be ideal. A relatively flat 8 mile walk at night in Zion wouldn’t be the worst thing though, sounds like it’d be surreal. 

For going farther up the West Rim trail past Angel’s Landing, is Cabin Spring just an obvious place to stop because it’s at the fork in the trail or are the views farther north along the trail less worth it? Joe’s Guide made it seem like walking farther along the West Rim trail would be very nice to see the West canyon. I’m considering devoting most/all of the day to Angel’s Landing and the West Rim trail. Conditions might be a bit treacherous though, I’ll have to play that by ear. That would, of course, stop me from doing The Narrows that day if I went that far. 

I’m in Utah for 1/2 a day on the 26th, full days 27-30th, and I’m flying out at 10pm on the 31st. 

I was planning to visit Bryce Canyon and Capitol Reef if the weather holds up. Maybe I should cut out Capitol Reef and spend more time in Zion.

"Okay, that’s quite convincing. The Narrows and The Subway will not be happening on the same day. I figured as much but wanted confirmation from someone with experience. I will try to go to Orderville Canyon and Big Springs so yeah, The Subway isn’t possible on the same day. Thanks for the warning about Left Fork, I really do not want to be there in the dark if possible. 

What about this: hike Angel’s Landing first thing in the morning, bring along the neoprene socks + dry pants + water boots in my pack, change into those clothes after my hike, and then go do The Narrows. I’ll be done with Angel’s Landing before 12pm probably  even if I’m taking my time and enjoying myself. 

My impression is that it seems doable if I pack efficiently. I would do The Subway the next day and do whatever other trails I have time for in the remainder of the day. 

That seems like my best option if I’m trying to do Angel’s Landing, The Narrows, and The Subway with other miscellaneous stuff all in 2 days. Thoughts?

"I had assumed you'd do Subway first because you wrote ""The Narrows in the afternoon since it’ll be a bit warmer perhaps"".  My fault for conflating the Angels-Narrows thought with the Narrows-Subway thought.  People spend up to 9 hours doing the Subway and that plus the drive there and back would take most of the daylight - but that doesn't matter since you're not doing Subway first, you're not that slow, and you'd start early in the dark if you were.

Doing both in one day though is just difficult to do.  First shuttle to start of Narrows leaves at 8am and will take 35 to 45 minutes to get there (assuming you're in line to get the first shuttle). Really booking it to Wall Street and back will take you three hours and then you have to wait for the shuttle, ride the shuttle back to town, eat/drive to Subway start.  Very unlikely you'd get started on that hike till after one, more likely two pm.  I can't imagine doing Subway in less than five hours (really should take you at least 7 hours but I'm assuming you go fast) so there will be quite a bit of time in the dark on the way back. Try not to get caught in the Left Fork after dark - footing is treacherous enough in the light.  It can be tricky to find the spot where you exit back out - so take mental note of the area where the trail connects with the water when you start, have GPS, watch for the signs, etc. - and much trickier in the dark.  Certainly wouldn't recommend an average hiker trying to trail find back in the dark on the Subway trail.  I'm assuming you're planning on bottoms up if you get the permit since you haven't mentioned arranging a shuttle.  Don't know how you'd do both if you add exploring Orderville Canyon or going all the way to Big Springs on your Narrows hike as that adds more hours to that hike.

One thing you could do that will help with time is to bring or rent a bike.  It's not a difficult ride, only a couple of short 5% grades and 8.5miles to Temple of Sinawava and 5miles to Grotto for Angels.  Start at 6 or 6:30 and start the hike(s) in the dark. It should take you well less than an hour to back there and even less on the way back downhill and you totally eliminate time spent waiting for and on the shuttles. Problem with renting is I'm not sure any of the outfitters will let you keep the bike overnight at the campground.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1638125845.0,0,t1_hmfkbeu,hmfkbeu,False,MountainGoat97,t3_r3vmx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r3vmx6/trip_itinerary_and_some_qs/,Trip Itinerary and Some Qs,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r3vmx6/trip_itinerary_and_some_qs/hmfkbeu/,2,r/ZionNationalPark,0,2

"Thank you for this response! I appreciate it. 

Yep, I’m very aware of the daylight constraints. I have no illusions about being able to complete everything on the list, it’s just a guideline and will be adjusted as the day happens. I did a trip last December and had to contend with the daylight limitations. 

Can you explain what you mean by “If you do get a permit, you might not even have time to get back to the shuttles to get to Temple of Siniwava”? I don’t understand what you mean since I’m doing The Narrows first in theory. This is probably in reference to doing AL first then trying to do The Narrows like I said in my original question about it but I’m leaning away from that now. 

I was planning to do The Narrows first on Day 3 because it’s higher priority compared to The Subway. I was imagining do The Narrows getting on the first shuttle, do it and get the full experience, and if it’s a reasonable time… drive to The Subway and do that. I have headlamps and doing The Subway later in the day means I won’t have to care about shuttle times or anything + I’d already have my water gear. I would just have to get back to Zion Outfitters to return my equipment in time. At worst, I have to hike back to the trailhead in the dark a bit but I’m not worried about that. I have night hiking experience and what not.",t2_c67sp6sf,MountainGoat97,0,1638117735.0,0,t1_hmf0alj,hmf0alj,False,MountainGoat97,t3_r3vmx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r3vmx6/trip_itinerary_and_some_qs/,Trip Itinerary and Some Qs,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r3vmx6/trip_itinerary_and_some_qs/hmf0alj/,1,r/ZionNationalPark,0,1
"One thing to remember is that there's barely 10 hours of daylight in that area that time of year.  It'll be really difficult logistically to do both Narrows and the Subway on one day.  It would also be extremely tight to do both Angels Landing and Narrows on the same day if you want to get to the good part of the Narrows.  Keep in mind that the last shuttle out of Temple of Sinawava leaves at 5:45pm that time of year - you miss it and you're walking another 8.5miles back to your campsite.

Truly hope you get the permit for Subway (add in time at the Wilderness Office in the park if you can't get a [calendar reservation](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/thesubway.htm)).  It's a pretty challenging hike normally but cold water and unpredictable conditions make it a very serious hike in December.  Be prepared.  If you do get the permit, you might not even have time to get back to the shuttles to get to Temple of Sinawava so that you can walk Riverside Walk and dip your toes into the start of the Narrows.  I'd probably add Riverside Walk/Narrows toe-dipping (and maybe drop something else) to your Day 2 if you do get the permit.

Bring head lamps so you can do sunset hike on either Canyon Overlook or Watchman.  Consider going on from Scout Lookout towards [Cabin Spring](http://runtrails.net/2016/apr12c.htm) on the West Rim Trail after Angels, assuming trail conditions are ok.  Different view of Angels Landing a bit down that trail and crowds really thin.

"Agreed. I hiked it recently. I love to backpack, but I'm a distance/endurance person. Steep inclines are hardest for me. The first part was honestly most challenging for me. Heights/narrow places don't scare or bother me. Some people can hike right up,and good for them, but if you have a harder time with prolonged, steep inclines, the start may be challenging.

"When are you planning on hiking?  Can be chilly in fall/winter with the higher elevation than Springdale area and the trail is shaded.  Can get snow on trail during winter.  I've never had issues with bugs at Zion - won't be any right now due to temperature and the desert climate the rest of the year limits them.  Doesn't hurt to be prepared though if you're going in spring or early summer.

It's a nice trail with a lot of creek crossings.  My only pointer for that is wear sturdy shoes.  You likely won't get your feet wet on the crossings unless spring melt or it's raining.  Did get my feet wet one time - started in morning and easy crossings but by afternoon the snow melt increased the flow enough that on the way back we had to step on rocks that were underwater.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1637710998.0,0,t1_hlu1i82,hlu1i82,True,Away-Conference7879,t3_r0p0qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r0p0qt/taylor_creek_hike_middle_fork_of_taylor_creek/,Taylor creek hike - middle fork of taylor creek,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/r0p0qt/taylor_creek_hike_middle_fork_of_taylor_creek/hlu1i82/,2,r/ZionNationalPark,0,2

"[Joe's Guide](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/recommend.php) is one of the best online resources for hiking in Zion. It's quite comprehensive.   Can check other sites like AllTrails where can get more current updates.  Iconic hikes are Angels Landing and Narrows (rent gear) but lots of other good hikes.  Include looking at hikes outside the main canyon like Northgate Peaks or Middle Fork of Taylor Creek so you can get away from the crazy busy main canyon on one or two of your days.

Summer months are very busy (and often exceedingly hot).  Spring break around March has become quite busy.  April/early May is not bad temp and busy-wise but risk not being able to do Narrows hike due to high current flow.  Fall is probably the sweet spot right now with temps and number of people.  It's still quite busy though especially on weekends when the aspens change.  January/February are the least visited and you likely won't have to deal with the shuttles but cold (rent dry suit if doing Narrows) and chance of snow/ice at upper elevations.  Services and hours are also reduced that time of year.

If you can afford and can get a reservation, getting a night or two at Zion Lodge inside the park is sweet.  You get to be in the park when it really quiets down in the evening AND you can get a head start on Angels Landing and Narrows if you're willing to get up and going before the shuttles start running (rent a bike at the lodge to get to the Narrows).  

The town of Springdale has lots of lodging (some $$$, some not) and it's right at the entrance to the park.  This is the next best place to stay cause you can leave your car at your lodging and walk or take the free town shuttle to the entrance and then catch the park shuttle into the main canyon.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1637264680.0,0,t1_hl5rxrp,hl5rxrp,True,Recklessone86,t3_qwxbjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/qwxbjl/when_where_how/,When Where How,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/qwxbjl/when_where_how/hl5rxrp/,1,r/ZionNationalPark,0,1
"Hey! It was great, we flew in Thurs and worked on Fri, finished up with work around 10am, drove in from St. George and hiked Watchman and Pa'Rus and just explored Springdale a bit. One of the guys wanted to be fancy so we went to Switchback for some pretty damn good food, then slept early and caught the very first shuttle into the canyon on Saturday (the line was already so long...). Half the people got off at Grotto and the other half went to the Narrows, we had no traffic going up to Angels Landing but coming down was pretty horrible. We then just took a very nice slow walk back down and then made our way to the Riverside Walk and dipped our toes in the Narrows and came back out for lunch and ice cream, then drove past the tunnel to take some photos (rock slide the day before so we couldn't go in, but they cleared it up fast), and finally slowly made our way back to St. George for the flight back out the next day!

"If you can manage/afford a night at Zion Lodge, you can get an early start on Angels well before the shuttle folks come.  Bring a headlamp and try to time your hike so you get up to Scout Lookout (spot right before the spur with chains to Angels Landing) at sunrise.  Also, I always recommend going further on West Rim trail after you do Angels - it gets you away from the crowds for a bit and has an alternate view of Angels.  Biking in early (with headlamp) is your next best option to avoid the crowded times on Angels.

For views, Watchman and Canyon Overlook and Northgate Peaks are the easy options after Angels/West Rim trail.  Look at East Mesa trail head (Observation Point) and Stave Spring trail head (Observation Pt, Deertrap Mt, Cable Mt) if road and trail conditions are ok and best if you have high clearance - definite views and solitude but not the most accessible.

"As already said, you have to take the shuttle to get into the main canyon (assuming you're not going between November 29th and December 22 - read up on details in the [park newspaper](https://www.nps.gov/zion/index.htm); shuttle also won't be running for most of Jan and Feb).  The main canyon is where the trail heads are for Angels Landing, Emerald Pools, Riverside Walk, Narrows, and a few other popular hikes. Personally, the best option over the shuttle is to bring/rent bikes/ebikes and bike to the trail heads in the main canyon.  You will likely have to be at the trail heads early to guarantee parking if you do go during a period when the shuttles aren't running and you need to check with the rangers about snow/ice conditions for Angels and really should have a dry suit for Narrows.

All that said, there are a lot of hikes in Zion where you drive to the trail head.  They're not as iconic and well-known as Angels and Narrows but that also means fewer people.  Look at [Joes Guide](https://www.citrusmilo.com/zionguide/recommend.php) for ideas like Watchman, Canyon Overlook, Middle Fork of Taylor, Northgate Peaks, and more.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1636645881.0,0,t1_hk7pv2r,hk7pv2r,True,[deleted],t3_qrn6z5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/qrn6z5/ride_or_drive/,Ride or drive,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/qrn6z5/ride_or_drive/hk7pv2r/,4,r/ZionNationalPark,0,4

You have to take a shuttle through the canyon scenic drive to get to the good hiking spots such as angles landing and the narrows. If you get to the park between 630 and 730 in the morning the parking should be available at the visitors center.

"I often recommend continue on [West Rim trail towards Cabin Spring](http://runtrails.net/2016/apr12c.htm) after doing the Angels Landing spur.  People sometimes feel intimidated by the heights and crowds on the Angels Landing section and continuing on West Rim gets you away from that.  You can go as far as you want and turn around but going just a little ways gets you a totally different view of Angels Landing than you have when you're on it.  It's a pretty busy trail up to Scout Lookout but gets very quiet past that.  Takes a bit of effort though (Walters Wiggles) to get up to Scout Lookout.

Walking Riverside Walk down to where you can dip your toes into the Virgin River at the start of the Narrows should be on your afternoon list after Angels.  Another good option for the afternoon is drive UT9 up the switchbacks, through the Zion-Mt Carmel tunnel, and on to the east entrance and back.  Lots of scenic pullouts if you're too tired to do more hiking.  Not a lot of maintained hikes in that section besides Canyon Overlook but you can explore at most pullouts (check out online Joes Guide to Zion) - go down into Clear Creek or hike back to Many Pools area.",t2_l3dpl,resynchronization,0,1636032274.0,0,t1_hja1vqd,hja1vqd,False,PolarisSONE,t3_qlx5mi,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/qlx5mi/been_to_zion_as_a_kid_going_again_next_week/,"Been to Zion as a kid, going again next week basically just for Angel's Landing, couple of questions!

Monday I did it from Angels landing trail head and up to lava.  (Opposite direction)

I think the full run upwards was better, although more clothing logistics.  After the 3,000 foot climb, I changed out of my wet clothes on the Mesa.  It was a walking lunch across Mesa

The logistics are easier from Lava down but that last four miles down 3,000 wasn’t fun on the knees.

">	Seems like a lot of extra back and forth hassle/cost vs simply getting up earlier to catch the shuttle in Springdale when I'm going to have to catch it in the park anyway.

Can you explain this a little more? How far away is the dispersed camping spot you’re thinking about? I would personally hate a long drive into Springdale/ the park in the mornings. 

Keep in mind - there are 2 shuttles. One goes through Springdale with the last stop at the visitor center so people don’t have to walk all the way through town. The 2nd takes people from the visitor center farther up into the canyon. There are some nice trails near the visitor center (like the watchman trail). 

In any case, yes I’d recommend staying at watchman any days that you can. That way, you’ll wake up and can start hiking or immediately get on a shuttle to go deeper into the canyon. You’ll avoid the Springdale shuttle altogether and won’t have to drive your personal vehicle in from your camp spot.",t2_39hlakbv,osuisok,0,1635868517.0,0,t1_hj0wah8,hj0wah8,False,Quasargyle,t3_qklpl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/qklpl9/renting_a_campervan_in_vegas_and_driving_up_to/,Renting a campervan in Vegas and driving up to Zion for 5 full days (7 nights)...,/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/qklpl9/renting_a_campervan_in_vegas_and_driving_up_to/hj0wah8/,1,r/ZionNationalPark,0,1

"Orderville (top down) into the Narrows is a nice canyon with some technical experience required (rappels, downclimbs, etc...). You will also encounter water of which will be cold so be prepared to get wet and stay wet. Watch the reported water levels as they can rise and fall each day. Stay tuned to ZPS regarding closures of the Narrows. During the warmer months you would certainly see more people in Orderville top down or coming up canyon from the Narrows, but obviously less this time of year. As the previous poster said...you have to work for the solitude. It is available and quite glorious when you find it! Safe adventures to you!

BTW...Coalpits Wash is nice this time of year with the cooler temps! I camped there last December and the night skies were gorgeous...albeit cold :)

If you stay outside of the park and outside of Springdale, you will need to drive in every day. Probably a good 30-45 minutes from most dispersed spots. The town shuttle only goes down the main road in Springdale, not to any camping spots.

"Honestly, you’re visiting a park where tens of thousands of other people want the exact same thing and unfortunately, a lot of the lesser know places in Zion will remain that way. The reason is, you have to work for them. Camping, hiking, canyoneering. In order to see the places that people usually don’t, it takes a lot of work. However.. go wander up the west rim past angels landing/scouts lookout. You’ll be pleasantly surprised at how fast the crowds disappear. 

As far as where to stay, Apple valley is about an hour and 15 from Zion, there is a connecting road, but it’s absolute trash right now and I avoid it even in my truck.

"I felt so lost trying to plan until we actually got there, so I get it!  Springdale is the only town in close proximity to zion.  It’s one main road that ends at the park entrance.  There are two shuttles, they meet at the entrance to the park.  One goes through the park, stopping at a bunch of different trailheads, the visitors center, the museum, and the campgrounds.  You can pretty much see the whole valley by utilizing the shuttle, although I do HIGHLY recommend driving Mt Carmel Highway both directions.  The other shuttle goes through the town of Springdale.  You can drive from your camp site to any parking in Springdale and catch the shuttle to the park entrance.  Springdale is pretty small so if you’re okay with walking, you can realistically walk to the park entrance from most of Springdale, as well.  

If you’re interested in the backcountry, Kolob canyon, or other parks of the park, the “adventure companies” in Springdale have one way shuttles you can book.

"You’ll park your camper wherever you decide to stay, drive a vehicle into the park or into town, find a parking spot, then drive back to your campsite at the end of the day.

"Unsure who might stumble into this later, but we've now completed this trip.

**Here is my report ->**We started at Lava Point, hiked within view of Angle's Landing, doubled-back, camped at campsite #3, then hiked back to Lava Point. Roughly 26 miles round-trip.

**But that's not what I had originally planned ->**I threw this trip together at the last minute and as I was hiking in I finally realized what I had signed up for. For some reason I thought campsite #3 was roughly half-way into our hike. It's NOT! It's about 9 miles into the trip and it's BEFORE descending a few thousand feet down into Zion Canyon.

My original plan was to hike to camp, then wake up early, quickly climb Angel's Landing before the tourists show up, then hike out. But that wasn't going to happen. It's too many miles. When I realized this we stopped at campsite #3, set up tent, stowed our heavy gear, then we continued onward down into Zion Canyon.

When we finally came into view of Angel's Landing we were 13 miles into our day. And it was noisy from all the tourists who took the shuttle from down below! After miles of solitude, it felt like a circus. But with the sun sitting low in the sky the views were great! We took a few minutes to enjoy the views of Angel's Landing in the distance, then turned around and climbed 4 miles back to camp.

**The verdict ->**  
I personally liked how we did it. There are many miles of boring hiking along the first 7 miles of the West Rim, but I loved the seclusion.

"Top down from Lava Point trailhead is 16.2 miles and for the most part all down hill. Gorgeous views all around! The hike up is indeed lots of uphill so an overnight pack would make it tougher. I have done that approach with a heavy pack and while long and difficult it's really not too bad...just take your time. Either way...the views are incredible. So many people miss out on this as they focus on Angel's Landing and never make that left at Scout's Lookout. I suppose it may depend on which campsite you secured as to which way you take. Enjoy!

"We went this past week. The weather was perfect. It’s pretty chilly in the morning, but once we got going it felt really good and then continued to warm up into the day. The shuttles were pretty busy, but we didn’t have to really wait for any (granted we were there Tuesday through Thursday, it got busier Thursday). We managed to find free visitor parking most days around 9-10am, except Thursday. The lot was very full though so like many have mentioned, earlier is better. Angel’s Landing was my favorite by far, but it was a pretty intense climb up hill. Once at the chain part, we had waited a few times to let people climb up or down but it wasn’t too bad and gave me a chance to catch my breath. I did run out of water on the way up so I would recommend bringing a little more than you think you need. While we got to do mostly everything, I regret not having done the Narrows fully, but Angels Landing really killed my knee and I had to take it easy.  The river walk trail on its own was very pleasant as well.

Prefer Zion but it’s crowded. Did Observation Point (8-10 miles round trip but flat) and Canyon Overlook (short hike) from the east side of the park.

"Oh yeah I did it with a group of people hot on my tail. Got 40 minutes at the top of alone time before people started coming up. 

My advice would be so 12-1am 3am is not early enough. 

I met a couple at the lookout but no one was at the top/edge for sunrise. 


Angels landing is not a hard or dangerous hike. It’s the people who think they are entitled to right of way on the chains and push each other until there is a jam that requires a lot of maneuvering. 

I took a nap in a crevice with a beautiful view and it was still gridlocked. 

Took me about an hr or so to get up top but 3 to get down 😯 

It really killed the mood because everything becomes like driving in LA traffic.

"When I did Bryce canyon I found an old post somewhere on Reddit with a recommended hike splicing together a few hikes. My wife and I did it and  it was amazing. I can't remember how to change everything but check the link below. I took a screenshot and marked it so you can see. It's about 6 miles going down and back up the valley. You start at Bryce point, walk down into the valley, but make sure to stay to the left because that's where all the iconic views are. Then we took that to Sunset point by taking another trail to connect them. I recommend having the free shuttle drop you off at Bryce Point and then you can hop on one at Sunset Point after.

"I took on angel landing because I have always had a fear of height and this is my first ever solo hiking trip. I wanted something special, angel landing was the must do for me. 

It took a lot of courage and fear suppression to do it. But honestly is not bad at all, as long as you focus on every step ahead of you and not look to the side and see the thousands of feet drops you’ll be good. 


In fact, on the way down I got so comfortable hanging off the cliff, I let people pass by going up And holding on the chain while I just walk around the edge of the cliff and go around them. 

I am extremely fearful of height and I can’t believe that I can get so comfort with cliff after today

"Can she bike?  Rent bike or ebike in Springdale and pedal Pa'rus and Zion Canyon Scenic Drive (instead of taking the shuttle).  Eight and a half mile from visitor center to end of road at Temple of Sinawava.  Might be too much and far for doing the main canyon but it's mostly easy grade.

Easy trails are Pa'rus, Riverside Walk, maybe Lower Emerald Pools, Timber Creek Overlook.  Might look at Canyon Overlook, but likely too many stairs.

"Hello! Went in the past 24 hours. We got to the parking lot around 6:45 am and got to the trailhead around 7:30ish. And I would say if we showed up 30 more minutes later, it would have been so annoying getting out. It would have probably added another 30-45 minutes just to get the end. Getting to the last part was not bad at all since we met a few groups coming back. I would also say we took our time getting there and took plenty of breaks. So in general, I would say get there as early as possible. 

I do think the views were great but not the absolute best; however,I do think the experience was really fun and memorable! I would say the videos on YouTube made it seem a lot more dangerous than it was. I do think you should still be careful and go at a pace that makes you feel comfortable.

"Unpopular opinion: I was a bit underwhelmed by Angel’s landing. The best part of the hike for me was my ability to now say I’ve done it and check it off the list. If you’re an experienced hiker, I personally think the views are pretty but very similar to other ones I’ve seen. 

Important context: I live in the southwest and have been to sedona/flagstaff/Grand Canyon a number of times and the rock formations and views are very similar to those areas so it didn’t feel as novel to me as it would to someone unfamiliar with the landscape. If you’ve never been to the southwest before, you should do it. 

If you have, I would recommend either just stopping at scout’s landing, doing another hike at Zion, or seeing if you can spend some time at the other national parks.

"To be honest, I'm not sure best time during a busy season.  I'm usually around in off seasons and mornings seem fine, afternoons are backed up, early evening seems okay but once in a while a challenge close to sunset.  Again, that's off season and not peak (May to Sept).

You can use Google satellite  map view and zoom in to get a better idea on the Canyon Overlook parking.  This is [the parking lot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canyon+Overlook+Trail,+Utah+84737/@37.2132504,-112.9410137,18z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80cac319b8f3a5e3:0xf7e72910f359cdd6) just as you exit the tunnel.  You have to cross the highway right there to get to the trail and stairs.  Pretty obvious when you're there and, of course, watch traffic.  The [triangular shaped pullout](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Canyon+Overlook+Trail,+Utah+84737/@37.2141075,-112.9404115,17z/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!3m1!1s0x80cac319b8f3a5e3:0xf7e72910f359cdd6) is just down the road a bit on the other side right at the first curve in the road.  The parking lot often is full no matter the time of day and you might have to park in a nearby pullout on the right side or do a u-ey and park in that triangular pullout (or other pullout) and walk a few hundred extra meters to the start of the trail.
