"In terms of activities and the environment, it’s hard to beat Beacon. It’s probably the single best place in the area to live. Cornwall is excellent for families, their school district is one of the best in the region and there’s more of a “community” feeling. The town of Newburgh is incredibly unsafe (especially in-and-around St Luke’s), and you would NOT want to live in the immediate vicinity. There’s also a new waterfront development in Poughkeepsie with spectacular views but it’s a bit of a drive.

"All dealerships are a little sleazy, but they really lean into lying to you (refusing to honor warranties, claiming a car has been all fixed up when it had obvious problems, refusing to put things in writing because they know they're lying, lying about the features of various cars, etc etc).

"So, I have an alternative, should you (or anyone here) want to listen.  
Car broker.
Hear me out.  
A friend of mine recommended this guy to us 4 years ago and I haven’t looked back since.  So, 4 years ago I figured I would try it.  Our lease was up and we needed a new family car.  I shopped (and I shopped hard, I’m a salesman) for a few of the cars I wanted for our family.  I got my prices and then I went to the broker. He told me “give me $300 and give me the top 3 cars you want to buy/lease” and he would do the rest.  I said ok.  About 2 weeks later he came back to me with the prices.  He beat my agreed upon prices  on EVERY car and EVERY price and EVERY add-on.  In addition he saved us over $4000 over the term of the lease.  
The way I looked at it, I paid him $300 to save over $4000 AND he took car of financing and even had the cars delivered to our house.  
 If it’s a lease, you get a better deal, he explained, but he can do the same with purchasing.  Nowadays he will even sell your car for you (back to a dealer, they’re looking for cars).  
Fast forward to 1 year ago.  The lease was up and I was looking to purchase a car now.  
I did the same thing.  Shopped and gave Reid my top 3 (actually I made it 4 because I’m a pain in the butt) and he, again, beat me on every car.  I think his price is $400 now, but he saved our family about $2500 on a new car in the middle of a pandemic.  
I highly recommend it.  If anyone wants the info, let me know.  I’m pretty sure it’s against the rules to “advertise” here.  I don’t know.  🤷🏼‍♂️

Wasn't a great experience. The sales woman was nice enough, but they were charging 4k above MSRP for GMC SUV's they had on the lot, and we were told if we put in an order, they couldn't even give us a price until they got it since it would be a ""market adjustment.""   
So that meant we could put down some cash to order, and anywhere between 4-12 months down the road when they get it in, they'll then give us the price. 

Absolutely ridiculous.

We left and a few days later got a call from the SA. I explained my issues so she put me on the phone with a ""manager"" who all of a sudden changed his tune and was willing to put in the order for us at 2k above MSRP.

"**[Subaru BRAT](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_BRAT)** 
 
 >The Subaru BRAT, an acronym for “Bi-drive Recreational All-terrain Transporter,” was a light-duty, four-wheel drive coupé utility, sold from 1978 until 1994. The vehicle was sold as the BRAT in the United States and Canada; as the 284 in the United Kingdom; as the Brumby in Australia; and was known as the Shifter, MV, or Targa in other markets. It was an export-only model, never being officially sold in Japan. Due to this, the BRAT became a popular grey import vehicle in Japan.

"The total bill is more than just the actual energy cost. Delivery charges are controlled by the state- those change over time. Supply cost is the actual energy that central Hudson buys from independent suppliers and that cost is set upstream. You can choose the provider that you want central Hudson to use, that can help control your cost. Central Hudson literally doesn’t control the supply in the bill- you pay exactly what cen hud pays. You’re literally complaining about federal pricing and your own lack of engagement with how you can control your own energy costs.

"Easier [yet.Buy](https://yet.Buy) 5 gallond of spring water and it it by the kitchen sink for drinking and [cooking.In](https://cooking.In) the end the least expensive solution.

Problems with RO:1. The water is demineralized.   
Since most mineral particles (including sodium, calcium, magnesium, magnesium, and iron) are larger than water molecules, they are removed by the semi-permeable membrane of the R.O. system.  
Even though you may find some contradictory information online about the health benefits of reverse osmosis water, I am convinced that drinking de-mineralized water is not healthy.  
The World Health Organization conducted a study that revealed some of the health risks associated with drinking demineralized water.  
Just a few of the risks include gastrointestinal problems, bone density issues, joint conditions, and cardiovascular disease. (See reference below to review the WHO study online.)  
Removing the naturally occurring minerals also leaves the water tasteless. Many people thus have to add liquid minerals to their R.O. water to improve the taste.  
2. The water is usually acidic.    
One of the primary reasons R.O. water is unhealthy is because removing the minerals makes the water acidic (often well below 7.0 pH). Drinking acidic water will not help maintain a healthy pH balance in the blood, which should be slightly alkaline.  
Depending on the source water and the specific R.O. system used, the pH of R.O. water can be anywhere from about 3.0 pH (very acidic) to 7.0 pH (neutral). Most of the R.O. water I have tested has been in the range of 5.0 to 6.0 pH. The only time I have ever seen R.O. water testing at 7.0 is when the R.O. system had the added remineralization element.  
In the natural health and medical communities, acidosis in the body is considered an underlying cause of most degenerative diseases.  
In fact, in 1931, Dr. Otto Warburg won the Nobel Prize for discovering the cause of cancer. In essence, he said it was caused by a lack of cellular oxygenation due to acidosis in the body.  
Medical research has also determined that drinking acidic water (as well as other acidic beverages) will often cause a mineral imbalance in the body.  
According to the WHO study, low mineral water increased diuresis (the production of urine by the kidneys) 20% on average and markedly increased the elimination of sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium and magnesium ions from the body.   
3. Some critical contaminants are not removed.    
While reverse osmosis is effective for removing a variety of contaminants in water, the reverse osmosis membrane alone does NOT remove volatile organic chemical (VOCs), chlorine and chloramines, pharmaceuticals, and a host of other synthetic chemicals found in municipal water.  
However, some R.O. systems now have multi-stage filtration media (in addition to the R.O. membrane), such as Activated Carbon, which does remove chlorine and certain pesticides.

........................

You can of course ADD a remineralization cartridge or add-on to your R.O. system.

"Yes - the Town of New Windsor installed some new wellfields relatively recently, which were found to be contaminated with PFAS after the Newburgh water crisis. The State stepped in, and NYSDEC installed some ""temporary"" treatment to remove the PFAS from the wellwater for the time being, with the understanding that New Windsor would step in and install permanent treatment at a later date. The ""temporary"" treatment is proving to be quite permanent at this point; regardless, New Windsor's water is safe to drink albeit not the greatest tasting (not the first complaint I've heard about New Windsor).

From memory, I think New Windsor's water is relatively soft but has elevated amounts of sodium, chloride, and sulfate - a water softener might not be very helpful here but an ion exchange/reverse osmosis system might be helpful; I'm only familiar with municipal systems so I can't help much with end user water adjustments.

"For a counter-top/carrafe solution I have found zero-water to be better than Brita. Compare reviews and tests online. They come with a sediment meter so you can test results for that.

Many home-centers will have water test kits you can send to a lab for a fee to get your water tested.

Also local water departments need to run periodic testing and file reports with the various county and state departments of health. They can be tricky to find as they are on many pages, or buried online among a ton of other stuff. Most should have them available on the local town site as well.

"So the playbook is generally they buy the property, begin building houses just large enough that they can be converted into dual kitchen houses (for kosher cooking purposes), bring enough people in to block vote out the town board or planning board, whoever has the authority over zoning, then  modify the zoning to allow higher density, then build condo complexes and associated structures to build out the community.  Along the way, they often overpower these local boards with high-priced law firms that outmaneuver town counsel and the local folks, then it becomes a predominantly orthodox community.  Nothing wrong with that of course in America, if a group has power, money, and organization, you can do anything you want.  But if that’s not the type of community you personally want to live in, you may want to look into other options.

The impact to the school district depends.  If it’s a large, multi-town school district (common upstate), it’s hard for that community to overpower the school board… even in Monroe the Monroe Central School District was large enough even KJ couldn’t take it over, they ended up forming their own school district.  But the district does have to pay for the bussing to private schools which can be impactful.  In towns where the school district is entirely within the borders of the same town, that’s where things can get dicey, sometimes the community takes over the board and can start stripping the district down to essentials, as has happened in other school districts (In Long Island, East Ranapo, etc).",t2_akri0,colcardaki,0,1648562404.0,0,t1_i2kci2x,i2kci2x,False,throwaway_da_baby,t3_tqjm4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/hudsonvalley/comments/tqjm4u/question_about_the_orthodox_community_in_the/,Question about the Orthodox community in the mid-Hudson region,/r/hudsonvalley/comments/tqjm4u/question_about_the_orthodox_community_in_the/i2kci2x/,4,r/hudsonvalley,0,4

"All of what you said is going to destroy the community you live in. I've seen it happen over and over. It's difficult to comment directly without offending other people in one way or another. Marginalization of women is the tip of the iceberg here-

When I used the word ""look"" it was purposefully and deliberately vague. I meant nothing to do with physical appearance. I meant it as an encompassing term. Again, so as not to offend. I assumed incorrectly that you could read between the lines of my comment. A drawback of conversation from behind a keyboard is that we miss nuances that help us understand true intention.

I'll be straight here- when the Orthodox start to move into areas in large numbers, your community will transition from the ground up. Small businesses will get pushed out in exchange for ones that are specific to the Orthodox needs. As the population grows, they will be able to take position in local governments, thus giving decision making power. Women outside their community will be marginalized openly. The public schools will change..on, and on. 

So, I say again if you do not mind the people next door looking very different from what you have been used to; put the for sale sign out now.

"I moved from Westchester county to Rockland county  1986 and Rockland county had these communities but were not as organized or as large.

I even witnessed it when my now EX mother in law's house was for sale nearby a  house of worship and there was a offering war on the house and for that time was unusually uncommon for that time. They get the house as my mother in law got more than she possibly imagined for a house she bought in the mid 1950's. Those communities exploded and took control of those areas with the help of the politicians( here is where the voting blocks come in) I am so glad I moved out of that area because the local and federal governments are getting fleeced bigtime and all the community services are geared to cater to these groups because the power of voting blocks and corruption.

"Although you can be openly queer in a bunch of HV towns, the village of New Paltz is the best bet to minimize your chances of dealing with homophobes.

There's a thriving hippy culture,  both among aging Deadheads and younger progressives & college kids. SUNY New Paltz also attracts a decent # of international students, which adds flavor to our culture. There are tons of Long Island transplants too, so you might find common ground there.

Occupancy is damn near 100% though, and we may be at the peak of the real estate bubble, so if you come here, you might want to rent for a long time while you search for the prefect house.

"Hi!  Cis/white dude chiming in but just  FYI about wappingers falls.  

On route 9 in Wappingers by a big shopping center there are perpetual Q/let's go Brandon protests. That being said prior to the current mayor, there was mayor who was gay and doing very well for himself in the community.   

Nonetheless, it is a very purple leaning red place. I unfortunately did see some repeat vandalism with no rhyme or reason aside from being a latina women owned store front.

The metro-north stop before Poughkeepsie (last one) is new hamburg which had an excellent Dominican restaurant that had the same issue but magically got shut down due to a ""zoning/permit"" issue. I did not ever see and explicit act of intolerance aside from the above though.

My wife and I loved it there, but had to move out because our family outgrew out house. We are now in Spackenkill area of poughkeepsie and really love it, accepting community with an excellent school district,  but you will need a car to get most places.

"May I suggest you perform a radon check regardless as to whether or not you seal your home, as radon is not mitigated by ventilation (as suggested by a sibling comment).

Radon comes from the ground and is pulled into your home by the lower pressure of the void (basement, etc.). Ventilating radon through the structure means that radon is still passing _through_ your home. That means that even though a ventilated structure might have a lower radon reading in a test, the same aggregated amount of radon has passed through the home and possibly through your body.

A radon mitigation system aims to create an area of even lower pressure beneath the slab of your home by using a fan to ""vacuum"" the radon up before it ever reaches your home. This attracts radon in high quantities and then ejects it high in the sky above your roof line.

Just to reiterate: ventilating your home does not decrease the amount of radon that passes through your home; only a mitigation system will. 
Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer in America, and it's serious business. 

You should certainly seal and insulate your home and not hold off on doing so because of radon because a leaky home will not protect you, only a radon mitigation system will.",t2_ij3fpkg,franklin-w-dixon,0,1648322517.0,0,t1_i2863dh,i2863dh,False,disc2slick,t3_to48pq,https://www.reddit.com/r/hudsonvalley/comments/to48pq/sealed_home_energy_solutions/,Sealed home energy solutions?,/r/hudsonvalley/comments/to48pq/sealed_home_energy_solutions/i2863dh/,2,r/hudsonvalley,0,2

"I can't give you any advice on local companies; I'm near Kingston too and my house is heated by oil.

I tried contacting local companies, via Google, and had no luck for blow-in insulation this past Fall. I picked the 3 highest reviewed companies in our area.

1 came out and gave me an $8k+ estimate.

1 wouldn't talk to me over the phone and directed me to their website but ended up having 2 different websites unbeknownst to me. I filled out the form on the first website and finally received a reply telling me to go to the other website to schedule a meeting. This was in October and the earliest available date they had was Dec 15th.

The last went right to voicemail explaining that they are merging with another company and not taking any new customers.

Finally, I turned to Home Advisor. Only 1 company from there replied. And they wanted to charge me $6k+.

"Then your title is wrong and misleading. Their rates didn’t go up, you’re mad that they didn’t bill you slowly over time? But you are paying the appropriate price at the end of the day? Most people would be happy not to give the state an interest free loan but that’s up to you. 

If you truly didn’t understand the increases and you’re just changing your story now, cen hud actually gave a [detailed explanation](https://www.cenhud.com/en/account-resources/rates/winter-energy-bills/) as to why customers would see billing increases. It also explains that they don’t control the “delivery cost” which you did complain about. Guess what one of the causes is? Reduced renewables performance in winter and a fall back to natural gas which has variable pricing based on supply and demand. Putins little war game isn’t helping.

"Just make sure you get a good system that you will be able to get replacement parts for. Since so much is imported, and with economic games being played by every country. Make sure you do not cut your nose to spite your face.

I am not sure you can totally disconnect. I am under the belief that.

All power generated must be consumed and not wasted. So if your home makes a certain amount of electricity and does not consume what it makes. It has to be bought by the power company in a reverse flow of power BACK to whatever power co you are connected to.

">""Gender affirming health care"" is the language used by the Texas law.   Talk therapy is health care, and is included in the Texas law as child abuse.

This is false on multiple levels.

The Texas ""law"" you appear to be concerned about is not a law at all, but rather a non-binding legal opinion issued by the Texas Attorney General.  It is here:  [https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/KP-0401.pdf?utm\_content=&utm\_medium=email&utm\_name=&utm\_source=govdelivery&utm\_term=](https://texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/KP-0401.pdf?utm_content=&utm_medium=email&utm_name=&utm_source=govdelivery&utm_term=)

There is also a letter issued by the Texas Governor directing the TX Dept. of Family and Protective Services to investigate potential child abuse.  That letter is here:  [https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/O-MastersJaime202202221358.pdf](https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/O-MastersJaime202202221358.pdf)

Neither of these documents includes the phrase ""Gender affirming health care.""  Neither of them relates to talk therapy.

Both documents are concerned, explicitly and unmistakably, with ""gender reassignment surgeries"" and ""drugs that induce transient or permanent infertility.""  It's right there on the 1st page of the AG's opinion.

I will also note that earlier in this conversation, I asked whether your use of ""gender affirming health care"" included drugs and surgeries, and you said ""it includes everything."" 

Again, you seem to be sincere in your views on this.  And if your sole concern is access to talk therapy for kids, I don't think we have much disagreement (nor, ironically, do you disagree with the TX government officials you mentioned).  But that's not what you said earlier.  And if you want your opinions to be based on research, you should check the primary sources.

"“Agenda-driven therapy” isn’t sanctioned in any venue. 

I know that the birth control example is common. That’s kind of my point. I was started on hormone therapy as a minor but it was no big deal bc it had nothing to do with my gender. 

The APA doesn’t view being trans as being mentally ill, so saying such is scientifically inaccurate.

"“Gender affirming health care” is the language used by the Texas law. I specifically used that language to avoid this conversation.  

Talk therapy is health care, and is included in the Texas law as child abuse. If a parent brings a 10 year old girl who thinks she might be a boy to a therapist, the parents abs therapist could be brought up on criminal child abuse charges. No licensed health care professional who wants to remain licensed would perform surgery on a 10 year old girl. I don’t know enough about hormones, but they’re not drugs, and are also prescribed for reasons other than gender affirmation and confusion. 

The reason I said Travis County and not Austin was because to compare 1 city to the whole Hudson valley is off. Even outside of the city limits, Travis County is still super pricy. It’s a great area, but hard to live in, and even harder to relocate to now. 

I don’t intentionally spin or insinuate. I will say what I mean. I’m sorry that you disagree with me. But my opinion on this Texas law is based on research. If drugs and surgeries to small children were an actual thing, my opinion would be be much different. But it’s not. I’m sure it happens, in the same way that there are people in every profession that do illegal and dangerous things. I am most certainly against that. But whether you “agree” with kids knowing their gender or not,  it’s a point of confusion for the kid and denying them talk therapy is dangerous.

"Well, I'd say the idea of giving, say, a 10-year old girl, whose body is changing and who has other stress factors in her life, drugs or surgery because she thinks she might be trans, is pretty messed up -- and does not constitute ""health care,"" at least not until there has been a pretty exhaustive attempt to help the child through talk therapy or other means.  I think the vast majority of people, especially parents, agree with that view.

I also think that if you want to have a real conversation with someone, it's important to be honest.  Using Orwellian, politically engineered phrasing like ""denying certain people the right to live as themselves"" and ""gender affirming health care"" is not honest -- it's just an attempt to spin the discussion away from the troubling reality, which is giving impressionable and fickle young children drugs or surgery, thereby changing their physiology, in ways that can't be undone.

For that matter, it's not honest to compare real estate pricing in Travis County (i.e. Austin -- but you chose not to say Austin) to that in the HV.  Of course Austin costs more than the HV.  It's apples and oranges.

I don't doubt that your feelings about this issue are sincere.  But hiding the reality behind spin control, and insinuating that those who disagree with you are bigots, doesn't do anything to advance your view.

"I know I’m SUPER late to this—but you’ve given a really accurate description of the Hudson Valley. To one degree, it can be what you make of it. A LOT of folks work in the city, only surround themselves by like-minded people, and it’s great. But I work and live in Orange County. The schools are losing mask mandates at the WORST times and I drive by hand-painted and WELDED MAGA/Trump signs. A neighbor already has a Trump 2024 flag up. I’m not sure if that’s better or worse than the houses that still have the Trump 2020 flags up. Then I drive 5-10 miles the other way and houses have the pride/progress flags up. You’ve got literal Wall Street bankers sharing grocery stores with farmers. I don’t know that it’s super comparable to another place. Thank you for giving a balanced view!

"If they’re looking to leave Texas, “for obvious reasons,” it’s likely something to do with the treatment of LGBTQ+ young people. Particularly trans young people. Fishkill is not the alternative I’d suggest for an accepting environment. 

I’d suggest Hudson. They’ve got a great, welcoming LGBTQ+ community. I see scrolling around that a few people have suggested it as well. If I didn’t have a tenured position kind of far away, I’d 100% head to Hudson.
