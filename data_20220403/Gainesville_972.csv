"I have personally known people who do wish to rent for many reasons.  Some are planning on moving soon and don't want to be responsible for ownership, others like the ability to walk away if they change their mind about living there.  Some prefer variety and change and want to move on.  The same way that I rent canoes 2 times a year instead of owning one.  I don't want to store and maintain something that I use rarely even if it might be fiscally better for me at some point.

I feel like you are arguing against property rights in a way that's incompatible with most folks understanding of property.  If I own something I should have the right to do with it, more or less, what I want.  We do curtail those rights to safe guard the environment and the rights of the society around them, but those limitations already.  Frustrate the aforementioned half the population.

If someone inherited two homes must they sell one immediately?  

Real property ownership seems much more useful and stable of an investment than stocks and other fiscal manipulations.  I can't see any way to change that aspect of the situation.  Especially if folks have planned that as retirement and worked a lifetime to get and grow those properties.

What crippled everyone in 2008 seemed to be more that you could procure loans that were impossible to keep paying on if anything changed.

It seems like your argument could be expanded to any wealth accumulation.  What sorts of wealth accumulation do you believe in?  How should people plan for future changes in currency valuation if they don't turn their currency into things that retain value. If I wanted to put solar panels in a field and sell the power from them, is that an acceptable form of wealth accumulation?  I own property that I'm ""not using"" in the same sense that renting is me not using it.  Is owning inns and beef and breakfasts illegal too?  Surely some amount of short term rentals is needed?  If I rent out a room in my house to someone, do they start owning that room?  When we were poor growing up we always had roommates to defray the cost of owning

I think your argument is interesting, but I can't see how to adjust property law in a way that doesn't directly infringe on people's rights to own things and then dispose of them as they wish",t2_cs49,bobbysmith007,0,1649002501.0,0,t1_i38kn6u,i38kn6u,False,MafiaMommaBruno,t3_tu5iyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/tu5iyl/orlando_and_miami_are_proposing_bills_for_rent/,Orlando and Miami are proposing bills for rent caps..,/r/GNV/comments/tu5iyl/orlando_and_miami_are_proposing_bills_for_rent/i38kn6u/,1,r/GNV,0,1

"Well, you can do all of that and still make houses that don't cost $350,000+ (which is what most new construction in Gainesville is) while also making a profit.

You can just make *more* money if you build more expensive houses. The margins are way lower on housing under that price point.

Obviously builders are going to focus on the segment of the market that makes them the most money.

The better solution might just be to require a certain percentage of any new developments to be low priced so that:

* affordable housing is spread out through the city instead of clustered in one area 
* the cost of those lower cost houses are spread out across all new development

"I see people vilifying landlords and all but pricing increases just make sense.

">What about people who prefer to rent; should they not be allowed to rent?

I need you to name me one person who *prefers* to rent. Cause honestly I don't think enough people know how home equity works, and just how utterly inferior renting is to owning. You can't tell me if, given the option, people will choose to pay money for a place to live that gives them literally zero return on investment, versus owning the place they're paying for.

>My grandfather moved his business and home a few times and ended up owning a half dozen properties at the end of his life and living on the rent till he died, as retirement fund. It seems wrong to limit that use of personal property, as its already an established right in our land.

What's wrong is taking other people's income as a retirement fund and denying them ownership. He could have sold the properties instead and invested the capital in some other way that didn't purposefully deny others the right to their own personal property. What does one man need with half a dozen properties that he isn't using? And I mean like actually living at or fulfilling a purpose other than rent collection.

>Limitations on private property are already one of the things most right leaning folks take issue with. I cant imagine anyone could convince that half the population to curtail this specific and lucrative aspect of private property.

This is probably the only legitimate problem listed here, which is ""half"" (if you could really call it that) of the American population's education on both politics and housing is derived from a good few centuries of imperialism and capitalism and don't even realize it. They'll impulsively reject anything that even slightly changes the status quo because that structure is built around amassing wealth at the expense of others in both property and opportunity. Of course they won't give up their advantage, and that's a serious problem because the advantage doesn't serve society at *all*. It's just more trickle-down nonsense that should have died with Regan.

Overall, I'm saying that finding and acknowledging the problem is easy. Actual implementation of solutions will be difficult, but necessary. You asked ""how do you move that forward?"", and the first part is easier (if not a bit painful) than most are willing to admit, and that is doing away with the aforementioned systems and structures that enable hording of housing/property and wealth.

"How do you move that forward?  Do all current landlords have to divest their properties?  As you point out some companies have thousands of properties?  What about people who prefer to rent; should they not be allowed to rent?

I feel like there is a difference between an older person who has managed to acquire a handful of properties in their life and renting the ones not in use, and an international investment firm that buys all available real estate, but I would be hard pressed to word it in a way that meaningfully separated the two.  My grandfather moved his business and home a few times and ended up owning a half dozen properties at the end of his life and living on the rent till he died, as retirement fund.  It seems wrong to limit that use of personal property, as its already an established right in our land.

"Affordable housing is a “pipe dream” term that gets thrown around a lot.  There is no such thing as affordable housing unless the government steps in to subsidize some portion of the venture. 

Look at it this way:

A developer wants to build an apartment building.  

They need to purchase the land - which they will need to pay market rates for.  

Then they need to do the engineering and design of the building - also at market rates. 

They need to hire the construction company who will build the building and pay market rates for all of it. 

Then they need to rent it out so they hire marketing teams, leasing agents, etc….. who will charge market rates. 

The developer needs to recoup their investment so they will set the rents according to the market.  

Nowhere in this scenario would below market rents make this a viable venture for any developer. 

Now, if the government steps in and donates the land, provides city engineers to come up with the site plan, subsidizes a portion of the construction costs, etc… Then the developer can charge below market rents and still make it a viable venture.",t2_10maru,e36m3guy,0,1648910690.0,0,t1_i342nuv,i342nuv,False,MafiaMommaBruno,t3_tu5iyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/tu5iyl/orlando_and_miami_are_proposing_bills_for_rent/,Orlando and Miami are proposing bills for rent caps..,/r/GNV/comments/tu5iyl/orlando_and_miami_are_proposing_bills_for_rent/i342nuv/,13,r/GNV,0,13

HUD has a technical definition that is conceptually the same - housing that costs no more than 30% of household income. This too means that less income means there is less “affordable housing” for you.

Then there are other jargon usages that don’t really make sense in communication with the general public but are unfortunately common.

"Yeah he said the same thing to me, dropped some neighbors' names and asked if I knew anyone who might be interested. He's just hoping to tell someone that ""Jane down the street is on board with Vivant"" and that'll hopefully get him a sale. He also asked me for a bottle of water, which I thought was strange but I'm guessing that was also another sales tactic, getting the customer to give you something, then he'd promise to ""hook me up"" or something like that. 

When I first bought my house last year, one of these guys (ADT Home Security) came by and I sat through the whole pitch. He told me that as a new homeowner, ""your insurance will pay for everything"". I was suspicious but I was both curious and broke and this sounded like good news - he asked to come back later and I said OK. He showed up with a woman who was clearly the veteran/""closer"" who whipped out all these documents and were trying to sign me up.  When I finally asked them straight up how much I'd be paying, they said it'd be around $50 per month. When I said ""no thanks"" they really put the pressure on me. I said can't I just call you guys after I do some research? The woman was like, ""no, we're only in town today and we're driving back to Jacksonville at 6am tomorrow so you have to decide pronto"". Anyway, obviously I got them out of my house and never called them, but that's essentially how the whole thing goes: 

tl;dr - it's just old fashioned door-to-door sales, they tell you it's free but it's not, and they pressure you to sign up right on the spot. Tell them ""no"" and they go away.

The walk for ichetucknee is more substantial, a good 15 minute walk from the parking lot, but then you get several miles of beautiful spring run river. During the summer there's a tram that will drive you to the launches but it's not running right now and not free.

Reasons why you might see higher than expected costs - I bolded the three that may be your issue. If its not the meter than its probably a a leak somewhere (unless you have an outside tap someone is using without your knowledge). 

*Seasonal Factors*  
*Seasonal factors such as outside temperature can affect your monthly water usage. For example, you may use more water during the summer months for gardening, pool maintenance and/or irrigation. Additionally, special occasions, holidays and guests in your home may cause you to use more water than usual. Check out our seasonal water-saving tips to learn how you can reduce your water use year-round, and be sure to follow local irrigation rules when watering your lawn.*  
***Leaks and Running Water***  
***Undetected water leaks, broken pipes, toilets that run continuously and dripping faucets can have a significant impact on your water bill. Review our water leak information sheet to learn more about leak detection, costs and repairs.***  
*Malfunctioning or Inefficient Appliances and Equipment*  
*Faulty irrigation systems, water heaters and water softeners, as well as inefficient faucets and showerheads, can be sources of wasted water. To see how you can make your home more efficient, call 352-393-1460 to schedule a free home energy and water survey with a trained GRU staff member.*  
*High Winter Maximum*  
*For most residential customers who do not have a separate irrigation meter, wastewater is not a metered service. Instead, wastewater charges are based on your metered water use for the billing month or your ""winter max,"" whichever amount is lower. Your winter max is re-established each year based on your water consumption during the January and February billing cycles. If you use a lot of water during this time, you may see higher wastewater bills for the remainder of the year. To learn more, read our winter max information sheet.*  
***Estimated vs. Actual Meter Read***  
***Was your water usage for the current or previous month estimated? To find out, look at the ""Meter Read Type"" column on your bill. Your usage may have been estimated for a number of reasons, including a locked gate, a physical obstruction, inclement weather or an outside pet. When our meter readers cannot access your meter, they must estimate your usage based on your consumption history. If your usage was estimated, it will be reconciled the next time your meter is read.***  
*Number of Days in Billing Cycle*  
*Look at the ""Days of Service"" column on your bill to see how many days were included in your most recent billing cycle. Billing cycles range from 28 to 35 days – that can make a big difference when it comes to your total water usage and amount due. Review our bill explanation page for more information on how to read and calculate your bill.*  
*Changes to Base Rates*  
*GRU's water rates are set by the Gainesville City Commission. Any changes to our base rates go into effect Oct. 1 each year. For more information, check out rates, deposits and fees page.*  
***Meter Misread***  
***GRU always strives for accuracy when reading your meter, but mistakes can happen. To see if your meter may have been misread, go outside and look at the number on your water meter; then compare it to the ""Present"" meter reading listed on the back of your bill. If your actual meter shows a lower number than the one on your bill, or if there seems to be a large discrepancy between the number on your meter and the one listed on your bill, please call us at 352-334-3434.***",t2_ckwnw8se,bowleysavage,0,1648842367.0,0,t1_i30v9os,i30v9os,True,MafiaMommaBruno,t3_ttza65,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/ttza65/my_wastewater_was_144_last_month_its_never_in_the/,My wastewater was $144 last month.

"How high was your water usage bill? If ur water bill is also rlly high it maybe a busted pipe or running toilet, could be a number of things.

For example, I had an extremely high gas bill in February (4 times the normal amount) but it went back to normal the next month.

I would contact ur landlord to see if they can come check for any water leaks first since I imagine that would be free.

"Sounded like your meeting was very vague, but that's by design. Many in your position don't make it far enough down the road to get the real ""pitch"", but eventually the goal is to sign YOU up to be doing exactly what they are doing. What are they doing? Well, they are trying to get you to attend a 2-day ""conference"" that will allow you to become a ""Go-Giver"" certified speaker. After a little digging, here's what I found:

*""Go-Giver certified speakers must attend the two-day live workshop, which can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $4,000 (depending on your desired package), not including lodging and meals. Note that the company typically does not offer refunds for live events or workshops.After attending the workshop, you can apply to the year-long Go-Giver speaker training program, which includes training resources and monthly coaching calls"".*

So to sum it all up: Someone approached them in a Starbucks a couple months ago and convinced them to pay $4,000 and for this conference, which basically taught them how to ""evangelize"" the Go-Giver program or whatever the hell it is, and now they are recruiting you for your $4,000 bucks, so you can do the same to other people in a month or two. 

Other stories have connected the Go-Giver to Amway, but either way it's just a scam and you should stay away from it.

"You'd probably get more bites if you put the $/hr on there.

Edit: Saw the post again, checked to see if there was a wage yet. There isn't. So I did y'all a favor and looked through OP's history.

He's made a couple comments on antiwork, seemingly against small businesses paying big wages. That doesn't bode well for anyone applying, though it's an understandable frustration. I've owned or co-owned a couple small businesses, and wages can take alot of your profit. So I wouldn't say he's necessarily paying at or below minimum wage.

Reading a lil further, there's a couple VERY conspiracy-minded things buried deep in those comments, but if he only talks about conspiracy stuff once every 100 times he opens his mouth, that's still better than any boss I've ever had.

> #Meadowbrook Golf Club owner submits plans for Topgolf-like driving range in Gainesville
>Fans of the Topgolf experience in bigger cities such as Orlando, Tampa and Jacksonville may soon have a similar option in Gainesville.

>Meadowbrook Golf Club owner Chris Marcum has submitted an application to Alachua County for permission to develop a two-story, 18,720-square-foot facility. Plans call for a maximum of 38 driving range bays, a clubhouse and restaurant.

>The proposed facility will be added to the Meadowbrook golf course in place of the current tee box for the first hole, shortening its distance by about 1,000 feet.

>Jeff Hayes, with the county's growth management department, said the application will be reviewed in the next week or so, and feedback will be provided for any needed revisions. The planning commission will then make a recommendation to the county commission, which will ultimately make a final decision.

>If approved, the facility will use Toptracer Range technology, which allows the hitter to track their ball’s flight and distance. The technology allows friends and family members to compete against each other in a variety of fun and interactive games.

>Marcum said the planned facility is not just good news for experienced golfers, but for people of all ages and abilities. Each hitting area, or bay, can accommodate up to eight guests.

>“It’s a lot like bowling when they throw the bumpers up,” he said of the scoring for the golf games. “As long as you keep it in your lane, you’re going to get something for it.”

>The project will cause one change to the actual golf course, which has been closed since July 2021 due to flooding caused by Tropical Storm Elsa. The length of the opening hole, currently a par 5, will be reduced and turned into a par 3 to make room for the new venue.

>Residents of the Meadowbrook community have expressed concerns in virtual workshops about the project, due to the impact of lighting at the facility. However, Marcum said the range will not be lit up at night.

>Instead, the scoring targets — created by Smart Targets — will be illuminated using LED lights. Users will be able to track their ball’s flight thanks to a flight-restricted ball that glows after being struck. The balls glow for about a minute after being hit.",t2_6hnxv,risto1116,0,1648649635.0,0,t1_i2ptt6w,i2ptt6w,True,gator_b,t3_ts64k7,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/ts64k7/top_golf_coming_to_meadowbrook/,Top Golf coming to Meadowbrook?,/r/GNV/comments/ts64k7/top_golf_coming_to_meadowbrook/i2ptt6w/,8,r/GNV,0,8

"Downtown apartments you could look at would be Arlington Square. I’ve heard mixed reviews, they are incredibly well located, but the apartments themselves are average.

"Not surprising at all. They have a budget just like the rest of us, and the pilots are very conscious of that budget. If they can get the fuel cheaper somewhere, it means that they can fly more hours. If they can fly more hours, they also have a better chance at getting their flight pay for that month. This is an actual struggle for military pilots these days... they have to have a certain number of flight hours each month in order to earn their flight pay, so having the fuel is important to them.

Combine that with the fact that the more flight hours they attain while in the military equates to better chances of getting a flight job in the airlines after their service, and you bet they are paying attention to what they are being charged for fuel.",t2_7ehp6,Wells1632,0,1648646719.0,0,t1_i2pn8jj,i2pn8jj,False,mahiney,t3_tr70fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/tr70fj/pair_of_low_flying_passenger_jets_circling/,Pair of low flying passenger jets circling,/r/GNV/comments/tr70fj/pair_of_low_flying_passenger_jets_circling/i2pn8jj/,1,r/GNV,0,1
"The fire department, just like everyone else, is on a tightly controlled budget. As such, their team (yes... TEAM) doesn't have a spare body to send out to buy lunch. So the TEAM has to go together to get lunch, and when that happens they have to take their equipment with them since they are on immediate call.

Now, let's combine in a couple of other factors:

* They aren't just buying lunch. They are also buying dinner for the evening shift, and breakfast for the morning shift. There is a reason they are going to a grocery store and not a restaurant.
* The emergency vehicles need to be run, and they need to be tested on a periodic basis to ensure that they are operational when they are needed for an actual emergency.

"I’m a Gainesville native, lived there for the better part of 27 years. If you like an “urban feel and lifestyle”, even though it’s a smaller town, you’re definitely going to want to live near downtown. The Duckpond, Pleasant Street, Even the student ghetto in midtown to a lesser degree will offer you the opportunity to walk a lot of places and enjoy good food and drink, as well as activities like Trivia.

Northwest Gainesville is family oriented and where Santa Fe (the state college) is located. It’s growing but more for families and retirees. The 20 something’s that live in that part of town are either students at Santa Fe or they are ACRs (Alachua County Residents, kids that grew up in Gainesville)

Southwest Gainesville is beginning to feel like an Orlando suburb. There is a lot of commercial construction and it is filled with chain stores and Restaurants. Archer Road is called restaurant road but you’ll find (mostly) PF Chang’s, Outback, Olive Garden etc. further in SW Gainesville you’ll find Haile Plantation which is quaint but uppity. There is a golf course, a nice village with shops and bakeries etc but it can get a little pricey. If you want a local village feel and want to live near mostly 40 year old plussers with kids in highschool this is great. Fun to visit even you don’t live out there, but Butler Plaza is a corporate, soulless development.

Restaurants you should eat at:

DragonFly for Sushi
Crane for Ramen
The Leaning Pig for Brunch
Boca Fiesta or Las Margaritas for Mexican/TexMex
Ember’s for a high end steak

"Gainesville has multiple areas that are very different

Downtown- fun, walkable, not unsafe but lots of petty theft

North of university- parties, and more petty theft

East Gainesville- more historic, underserved by local government,  great neighbors, higher crime but it feels localized to those individuals in crime... or possibly the heavy GPD traffic trolling every neighborhood in order to catch minor offences.  My favorite place to live in Gainesville.

North west Gainesville- from north main through 43rd street, calm, low crime, not very walk/bikable, family oriented and 

South of University student areas/archer/tower road- solid no from me, high crime, traffic.

"Welcome!

There is no singular ""best place"" to live in Gainesville - it is really dependent on what kind of lifestyle you want & what your budget is. I'm around your age and live Downtown because of the location - there's lots to do within walking distance. I have a lot of friends who live in Pleasant Street or Duckpond. 

People are pretty nice here, I've found it easy to make friends and get involved in the community. Gainesville's small-town feel can get a little stifling at times. 

There's an excellent indie coffee shop scene here if that's your thing - my personal favorite is Wyatt's!",t2_con0eoca,Grouchy_Chapter5606,0,1648592080.0,0,t1_i2mik1z,i2mik1z,True,_jocii_,t3_trizvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/trizvb/thinking_of_moving_to_gainesville/,Thinking of Moving to Gainesville!,/r/GNV/comments/trizvb/thinking_of_moving_to_gainesville/i2mik1z/,18,r/GNV,0,18

I lived in a 1/1 there for a year as a post-college young professional and enjoyed it. It’s expensive for sure but at the time I was splitting rent with my partner so it made it reasonable. I was on a top floor corner unit (other wall was parking garage) and never had an issue with noise from shared walls. Noise from the pools can def carry if you’re facing one of them. I imagine the rooms facing their little meditation garden would probably be the most peaceful overall. Office staff were very helpful and maintenance guys were SO friendly and responsive.

"I used to shoot at GTR several years ago (when it was only ranges 1-3) with the safe shooter cert. It was fine, but eventually the membership costs weren't worth it with my lack of shooting. It looks like it's about $27 for a day pass now with I think only paper targets on range 2 (up to 25 yards). Unless it has changed you should plan on bringing paper targets, shoot-n-sees, and a heavy duty stapler to assemble your targets. Also, make sure before you go out that they aren't doing a club shoot (IDPA, IPSC, etc) since they can close the ranges. 

Bradford Sportsmen's Farm is further out, but is only $20 / day. Definitely has more of a good ol' boys feel; the range is self policed  but generally if everyone agrees your targets are OK you can feel free to shoot them (i.e., those plastic self-healing targets are fine). Also, the rifle range is 300 yards which is fun.

"Just to add a bit more info for those interested:

>In 1868, heavy rains filled the basin, but quickly drained away. About 1871, Alachua Sink was temporarily blocked and the basin became full for several years. From 1871 to 1891 Alachua Lake was receiving enough water that steamboats were able to be used on it. A line ran from Chacala Pond to Sweetwater Branch. About 1889, the water level of Alachua Lake began to slowly drop. During the winter of 1890/1891 the lake was 58 feet deep. Then in late July and August 1891, the water levels of Alachua Lake suddenly dropped. Its banks were littered with dead fish and dead alligators. At one point, the water levels dropped eight feet in the span of ten days and left the lake with only its two main basins with any water.\[8\] This draining event marooned one of the steamers then plying the lake, and similar events had occurred in 1823 and 1870.

"straight up mam this food desert and lack of public transit makes me a blind person very depressed. Where can the blind go? Nowhere. But were not talking about how Gainesville is slow to help the blind and disabled. After all, it seems that the overall consensus around here about the disabled is to keep them out of sight and out of mind. -I have fun so I sneaked a blind pun in there- 

I grew up in a township with a pop. of 1000 and we had 3 grocery stores and 4 restraunts. So why is it that East side has more than my hometowns population but far less than my hometown had? Maybe it has something to do with the poverty? Or the color? Or something else? Whatever it is it is pretty obvious that Gainesville doesnt give a cockroaches shit about East Side. The data shows it.

well thats not all true, they are building a Community Center here but they are taking there sweet time doing it. been under construction for two years now and they are still not done.

"The Gainesville Sun is available for free with a library card, here’s the article:

“The owners of more than 4,000 acres west of Gainesville say they have a vision for a ""grand plan"" that would lead to its own community with land set aside for environmental protection, a golf course and other amenities.

What they don't want: Sporadically built homes with little coordination, adding hundreds of new wells and septic systems.

More than 60 neighbors living close to the area on Wednesday evening gathered on the fifth-floor office at 5001 Celebration Pointe Ave. to learn about the proposed development of 4,068 acres, which includes land set aside for a new University of Florida golf course.

Residents filled the room, offering more questions than criticism. The stakeholders' workshop is a preliminary step in a long process, with little expectation that any Earth-moving equipment will be at work this year.

""We want to assure you that the family members that are part of this partnership have a great love for this land,"" said Gerry Dedenbach, executive vice president of CHW consultants. ""And they want to look at a long-term legacy that involves the restoration and the long-term outcomes consistent with the way most of us feel about land here in Alachua County.""

The property in question sits along Parker Road (Southwest 122nd Street), west of Haile Plantation, and south of Oakmont and Town of Tioga. Under current zoning, the owners, who are being referred to as ""the Lee family,"" have the ability to develop 813 homes with wells and septic tanks.

But that's not quite what is envisioned, Dedenbach said.

What the family does want, he said, is a master-planned community with amenities such as its own solar power generation, biking and walking paths, central water and sewer, police and fire stations and recreational amenities.

""I would think later this year, in the fall, that we would have concept (development) plans, he said.

It is the largest project suggested in Alachua County since Plum Creek, now Weyerhaeuser, proposed a plan for more than 40,000 acres in east Alachua County a decade ago. That project never moved forward, largely over environmental concerns for wetlands.

The Lee family has offered to donate 300 acres at the southeast corner, nearest Archer Road, for a new University of Florida golf course.

About two square miles would be set aside for conservation. That is about a third of the total 6-square miles in question.

Developers for several months have been conducting a ""special area study,"" evaluating the environment and species on the property.

Dedenbach added that 840 acres on the west side of the property will be set aside for a gopher tortoise preserve, along with a pedestrian pathway leading to Tioga. On the east side, a number of sinkholes will be included in an undeveloped north-south corridor.

After the environmental assessment is done, a special area plan will be put together in which development plans and requested zoning changes for the property. They hope to convince Gainesville and Alachua County to extend water and sewer services onto the property, which is not allowed there now.

""We can look at housing, and look at how market-rate housing, how workforce housing, how affordable housing might be designed into a holistically planned community,"" Dedenbach said. ""We can also look from the start at energy options for our property.""

He said the plan could also identify multi-modal transportation options for residents.

""Someplace that has the ability from the start to have vehicles because we own those, but then, bicycling, walking, alternative transportation means — whether it's golf carts or electric type vehicles — and we can do that from the start,"" Dedenbach said.

He added that the project could also incorporate composting and vegetative management practices to reduce the use of pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers.

Demand for housing continues

Dedenbach said he looks forward to collaborating on the development, adding that it's very much needed for the number of people moving to the region.

""About 1,000 people a day move to the state of Florida, and annually that equates to like another Orlando happening here,"" he said.

Residents asked a wide range of questions and concerns, including how the project might impact traffic on Parker Road, the black bobcat population and the flight path of the Flying Ten Airport.

T.J. Frasier asked whether noise studies will be done on the development's impact on the airport and its approach.

""This a public-use aviation airport,"" she said. ""There is an obligation on the county's part to protect that airport.""

She said if a pilot had to make an emergency landing before the runway they may not make it safely if there are homes. ""So there is that increased risk around us,"" she said.

Dedenbach said the noise and other impacts of the project on the airport and its flight path would be reviewed in the special area plan process.

""This study (happening now) is really focused on the ecology and the ecosystem out there,"" he said.”",t2_34ec81hl,shotsofglitter,0,1648254432.0,0,t1_i24wg9j,i24wg9j,False,[deleted],t3_tnwu6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/tnwu6o/so_westside_is_getting_a_golf_course_and_eastside/,So Westside is getting a Golf Course and Eastside gets nothing... again?,/r/GNV/comments/tnwu6o/so_westside_is_getting_a_golf_course_and_eastside/i24wg9j/,3,r/GNV,0,3

"I really hope she finds her cat! My friend's cat escaped last year and was missing for about a week before we found her hiding in the bushes across the street.

I highly recommend actually going to the shelter to check for the cat. Another friend lost her cat and called the shelter to see if he was there. They said no, he didn't fit the description of any cats they had. She had a nagging feeling and went to check anyway...  sure enough, she found him at the county shelter.

Just a heads up though, we do have coyotes in the area and they eat outdoor cats (one even ran off with a small dog that was being walked by its owner in west Gainesville). I know people like to let their cats out, but they are so much safer indoors. And yes, coyotes do venture into town, especially near creeks and in wooded areas (like right around there at Hogtown Creek).",t2_c88mq,hatcatcha,0,1648165227.0,0,t1_i1zykq3,i1zykq3,True,Cookeina_92,t3_tl14np,https://www.reddit.com/r/GNV/comments/tl14np/lost_pet_in_gainesville/,Lost pet in Gainesville,/r/GNV/comments/tl14np/lost_pet_in_gainesville/i1zykq3/,1,r/GNV,0,1
