"I am a few weeks away from being in my Taber new construction home for a whole year. Do NOT build with them unless you like fighting with contractors. Also, all of their reviews and comments on Facebook are controlled. I posted the comment below on an ad.  The comment was deleted, and I am now blocked from commenting or reviewing their business. Check their Yelp reviews.  They use pine cabinets that are soft and easily dented. They overpaint up to 1/2 inch on EVERY surface. 5 months in, that overpaint makes it look like there is cracking along your walls but it is just the paint has cracked as the ""natural settling"" occurs and your cabinets shift away from being completely flush.  They use an inferior grout that needs to be sealed. The flooring company will tell you that everything is normal but it is not.  Actually all of their contractors will try to tell you the issue is normal...that is if they actually show up to the appointment. The contractors constantly lie, and Taber does nothing to follow up. There is just so much wrong that it isn't worth it. If I could go back, I would have never gotten myself into this situation. I have spent countless hours fighting all of them just to get things to be right as they should have been in the beginning. 

Deleted Facebook Comment: 
Don't build with them. They are horrible builders and the warranty department's only responsibility is to submit issues to the contractors that never show or say everything is normal. Also their houses have gone up over 100k in a year. The houses are not worth it. Every review is a new home owner that hasn't found the stair step crack in the brick or shearing of the drywall...yet.  My neighbor across the street has a bowing foundation. The one behind me has a front window casing that isn't attached to the house. I'm sure we are anomolies though. Right?

Cops in okc are the worst. Good luck taking it to the judge. The judges in okc are ego filled douche bags.

I got a ticket for going a speed that my vehicle was physically incapable of even going. I told the cop that it was impossible for my old ass truck to be at that speed when it’s never gone that fast before. 

I went to okc court with a video of my dash as well as documentation of the actual information on the old ass truck. 

The judge demeaned me and shamed me for (checks notes) defending myself in the court of law.

"My suggestion: find a gym that is close to you with basic equipment, and go with that.  If you are a beginner  just **going** regularly will be enough to start making improvements, and pretty much every single gym will have beginner stuff.  But if a place is inconvenient to get to, or far away, then it's too easy to make excuses not to go.  Somewhere that's less than a 5 minute drive is ideal.  Somewhere that you have to drive 20 minutes in traffic each way to get to is a recipe for you to stop going after a week or two.

"Really? I went to college at U of A in the late 90s and early 2000s, and the live music scene at the time **sucked**. JR’s Lightbulb Club pretty much stopped having live music. Dave’s on Dickson and George’s still had a show here or there, but not much. Clunk Music Hall had shows, but they got progressively weirder and weirder indie shit. And that was it. 

By contrast, OKC seems like a boon. Tower has tons of stuff. Criterion is finally stepping up their game. Beer City Music Hall is getting more and more. Jones Assembly gets some good acts. Big stadium shows at Paycom. Zoo Amp gets good stuff. With luck both the Blue Note and the Blue Door will open again.  89th Street Collective is great for punk acts. Diamond Ballroom seems to have a lot of metal shows, but definitely isn’t limited to that (I saw Modest Mouse there a few months back).

"So, I remember having arguments about this type of thing in the past.  Specifically the ten commandments mess.  What I learned is the First Amendment initially did not limit the ability of the individual states to ""establish state religions"" only that the Federal Government couldn't.  Of course, since then there have been several cases that tested that and the Supreme Court extended the limitation of government-sanctioned religions to Federal and State governments.  I suspect the author of this bill just wanted his grandma to be proud of him for once.   This is an example of a worthless bill that is simply designed to cause a fuss so that it is easier for them to pass bills under the table, or at least so we don't notice it until it is too late.  The GOP has been great at doing this over the last 20+ years so it doesn't surprise me.  

So write your rep, but be sure to ask if they are going to make the bible the state book, we should know which version is the state-sanctioned one.  I mean there are literally hundreds of different versions.
