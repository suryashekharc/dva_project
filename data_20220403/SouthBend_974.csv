"40% of Americans do not believe Biden didn't win the election. That is ludicrous. 40% of Americans didn't even vote for Donald Trump. The courts had already determined there was no issue with the election. The states had already certified their own elections. No one in that room actually believed the election was fraudulent. There was a concerted effort by the Trump administration to attempt to delay the certification with no reason or legal basis so that they could have more time to attempt to undermine the will of the voters. She was taking part in that effort. If voting against the results of a free and fair election that has been litigated by local courts, by state courts, by state supreme courts, by federal courts, by federal appeals courts, and considered by SCOTUS is not voting against democracy, then I don't know what is. You can't change the results of an election because you don't like them.

Trump talked about abolishing NATO. He suggested that we wouldn't honor our Article 5 obligations, despite us being the only country in the history of alliance to invoke them.

It was not a vote to change the election, it was a vote to inspect the election. The insurrection was from a very small percentage of republicans, it was not incited, and it is NOT comparable to 9/11. You really want to say that was a vote against democracy.

Now lets talk about NATO. Trump was so against NATO because America is spending proportionally more on it then any other country that is a part. Other countries were gaining defense from us at a far lower cost, so of course they would be weaker. However, that does not mean we still couldnt join into a war and Putin knew that, he also knew he would lose if we did.

"There are plusses and minuses like anywhere else.  

South Bend isn't the only city in the immediate region.  I know most people outside the US don't have the commute mind us Americans do, but it's not uncommon to live in a neighboring town and commute to ND.  Other notable cities in the area include Mishawaka, Elkhart, and Niles.  There are even more smaller towns within less-than an hour drive of ND.  Nobody would think twice if you lived in Elkhart and commuted the 30-40 minute drive to Notre Dame.

Our cost of living is near the lowest in the entire country.  There are more activities now than there were 20 years ago by far.  And food/drink choices have greatly expanded as well.  

Prepare yourself for much more winter than you will ever see in the UK.  Our average winters are probably colder and snowier than your worst.  If you're not up to staying indoors and entertaining yourself in adverse weather, it's something to consider.

If you fail to be interested in something locally, larger events are held in the big cities that are all easily driven to and from in the same day.  Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Grand Rapids are all less than a 3 hour drive away.

As a side note, you absolutely cannot be averse to the idea of driving and commute times.  While SB/Mishawaka has probably the best mass-transit system in the area, it's still very limited and the city (other than certain areas) is not very ""walkable"".  We love our cars and our towns are just designed for them.  And our cars on average are larger to make the commute more enjoyable.

Why bring up two completely out of state cities? Indiana is the crossroads of America and it's a pit stop for everyone, scum of the earth included. 

I think you're a troll account and that your opinion on life in South Bend is tainted by the political views you're getting from your preferred segment of mass media. 

To the original poster I would also add that South Bend has year-round cultural events including Art Week. I'd also add that the nearby suburban area in Granger is one of the nicest places to live in Indiana. Granger has some new bicycle infrastructure and good schools both private and public nearby, and has accommodating home prices in regards to size.

"Who actually did the work?  Most fiber boring projects are not done by AT&T directly, but through multiple layers of subcontracting.  

AT&T probably has very little knowledge of how the local situation is being handled.  They likely have one contractor taking care of the whole county, who then recruited their own subcontractors to do the work with them.

Having dealt with these companies, most of them are fly-by-night operations that are very inexperienced and from out of town doing the actual work.  Your best bet is to get ahold of the lead contractor that's actually paid by AT&T to do the work to get things done.  As they're in control of all the subcontractors.  They will usually be driving the nicest trucks with the nicest equipment in the area.  Heavily logo'd as well.  They will also usually be the ones with the locate ticket in their name.  

Some of these subcontracted companies have literally been kicked out of various cities in the area for their general disregard of city ordinances, lack of excavation permits, and stealing water from public fire hydrants.

Originally the transmission line work was supposed to be done by last fall. 

You could though just cut over to Niles Ave. from the race's end, then once you get to the Niles/Leeper/Napoleon intersection, turn left onto Leeper and take the staircase up to the north end of the bridge, from which the trail is open.

"No, there's not a large British population but there's a couple handful, most of which work at the University. No one really cares where you're from.... It's an interesting conversation starter but that's about it. Just like most Universities in the states, there's a fairly diverse international population working/teaching there. 

There's a few options for food if you get homesick. Most of our UK food in South Bend will be ""Irish"" meaning you can get a fry-up or pub grub like fish and chips, scotch eggs, shepherd's pie, Carlsberg/Strongbow/Stella at places like Fiddlers Hearth (Irish-themed pub). They're the only place in all of South Bend that actually will have vinegar set out believe it or not. 

This stall at our farmers market supposedly sells English treats but haven't tried. https://www.facebook.com/thegbtreathouse/

Shops like Bambers are a bit dear but sell UK food.

In general English media, and obviously BBC content has been particularly mainstream in the states the last 5-10 years or so.

"... I'm not sure why that would help him?

Edit: so It didn't seem like an empty dickish comment

1) They're different countries. Sure N. Ireland is part of the UK but that's like telling a Scottish expat that we have a soccer team called the South Bend Redcoats.... if that helps. 

2) The depth to which ND is Irish is pretty much limited to our use of a Leprechaun mascot (which Irish people typically view as tacky American tourist crap) 

3) Something something....colonialism, potato famine, N. Ireland, Brexit, the troubles, new calls for a unified Ireland... can make your comment a bit tone deaf to some.

Bonus Trivia: 

""One theory associates the popularity of the nickname to the visit from future President of the Republic of Ireland, Éamon de Valera, who had been part of the 1916 Easter Rising (insurrection against Brits where 485 died) and was imprisoned and sentenced to death. He was given amnesty, elected to Parliament and arrested by the authorities again. He escaped and slipped off to America to avoid recapture.

"I haven't lived in the South Bend area in a long time but was born in Mishawaka. There will be some sticker shock but overall it's a great place to live. Mishawaka is extremely affordable, is growing, and has just about everything you'd need to feel comfortable. SBN airport can get you anywhere you want to recreate pretty easily now. It was a tiny regional airport when I was a kid. 

Notre Dame is a large part of the area's revenue growth and different economic areas are obvious. There are so many folks from all over the world that come to UND to study or teach, you will not have a problem finding a social group. MeetUp.com will be your best friend I bet. I saw Christopher Hitchens debate Dinesh D'Souza at UND years ago.

I visit my goddaughter in Mishawaka every summer and it's always a wonderful trip. The summers are beautiful. Lake Michigan is your weekend haven. No salt water, no sharks. Even my wife (an 8th generation Texan) loves visiting so much we went 3 times last year.

"The Wheelchair Hockey League of Michigan, with the support of the Michigan State University Adaptive Sports and Recreation Club, is proud to announce the first wheelchair hockey clinic in SWMI! 

Wheelchair hockey is an amazing sport where athletes with a wide range of physical disabilities can competitively play together on the same floor! The only requirements to play are that you are at least 10 years old, you can control your own wheelchair (power or manual), and that you have the cognitive ability to understand the rules. Outside of these basic requirements, we will work with you to maximize your abilities, and get you in the game! 

Whether you are looking for a new recreational opportunity, a competitive outlet, or a sense of community, this is a great opportunity to find all of that and more!

Registration is open now until May 14th!

To register, please fill out this form: https://forms.gle/62bbWjxRicu4N96A7

"Sure. One on the corner of Chapin and Washington st. A stone house, big, was turned into apartments. It had 8 bedrooms. Somebody bought it, and started to renovate it. They knocked a bunch of holes in the wall, tore out all of the plumbing, then pulled the furnace, (Or furnaces) out of it, because it's 8500 sf. Someone before, had shoved in some electric baseboard heaters into it. So it must have cost a small fortune to heat it. It's got a fieldstone basement. ( Not unusual for a house of that age) To me, it looks like it's built with decorative concrete block. Just like my basement walls, that are exposed below my siding, and above ground. I can find some houses with that feature around town, which makes me believe it's all constructed with that. (And the color is too even.) It's exactly the same color as concrete. I'd bet, a tape measure, a couple minutes and you'd find out that all of the block are the exact same measurement. One concrete drill, one hole would tell me if I'm right, or wrong.

Yeah, it's in a historic district. And two blocks over, you can get the chance to get shot at. (Or sit on the front porch on a summer evening and listen to the crickets, and driveby shootings.) The name associated with it, is Kizer. What he's famous for, I don't know. Somebody bought the place, and dumped a bunch of money into the exterior of it. Outside, it looks good. inside is trashed. And they want 350K for it. It's been for sale for four years, off and on. Park a nice car outside of it, it won't stay nice for long. Oh, and it sits on a postage stamp sized lot.

Another one was over on North Main in Mishawaka. It was an old rundown building, with a couple stores in it, and some apartments above it. It got bought, and demo'ed. People hollared about it, because at one time somebody shopped there. It looked crummy on the outside, it probably looked just as bad inside.

State theater is another. That, people thought it would get fixed up. But nobody was willing to dump one mil plus into it.

Another one I saw personally, two blocks east of Michigan st. And old church. That was ONE HUGE FIRETRAP! They wanted me to work on it. It was a black hole, everything needed fixing. Busted plaster on the floors everywhere. Hot electric wires laid on the floors! Broken windows, Electric service, I don't know how the hell they managed to get it turned on. A roof was leaking directly on the main service panel. It was supposed to be some sort of mission. They begged to get a couple of Pellet stoves from TSC in it for heat in a couple rooms. I talked to the.... owner, I guess. It felt like if I worked on that mess, I'd NEVER get paid. When I walked out of that, I STAYED OUT! I wasn't going to be held Libel for anything I'd do in that joint. I was even glad I rode my Motorcycle there. If I drove my truck, I'd be short all of my tools. (It's surrounded by SB's Homeless population)

Some houses, yes I could see putting money into them. But where is the line drawn? Harrison's down on No. Miami street. Some tenant got mad because his girlfriend was seeing some other guy.  He took her clothing, threw it out on the roof, and set fire to it-And it gutted the building! The walls are still standing. Someone bought it last year, and started to rebuild the insides of it. Obviously without a permit. The floors are in it, a roof, and a red tag sits on it. A stop work order on it by the building department. The outside was rather unique, a little porch on the second floor on the streetside. With the price of lumber right now, I highly doubt it will ever be finished. Provided they can get a release from the building department. (Which I doubt. It's a commercial building. That needs Engineers Prints, State approval, and I don't see ANY engineer willing to risk his state licence over that.)

"The problem is that other landlords in other parts of the city and county thought that meant they could jack prices up too. Just because rich Domer kids' parents are willing to shell out that kind of money for a single room in a house doesn't mean all the landlords across the county should be following suit. 
  I lived in that county from August 1991 to August 2018. Housing was not always this expensive. 
   
  Hamilton County is not only a suburb of a big city but is one of the most affluent counties in the state with great schools. It is a very desirable place to live. These are things that tend to make housing far more expensive. 


I also said the last apartment we rented up there was by Costco. It had a Granger address. Rent was still more per square foot and the complex had far fewer amenities than what we got in Fishers.

"We moved to the area (Granger) a few months ago and just signed a contract on a house a few weeks ago. Everyone has different expectations for housing, of course, but like you, we wanted something in a nice neighborhood, with decent schools, for $250K. 

We spent MONTHS online researching housing costs in the SB area and figuring out which neighborhoods would be ideal before we relocated. We had all the data, and we thought we were going to buy a nice little home in a historic neighborhood, pay it off quickly, and start saving for retirement. The reality was quite different.

If you have looked at used cars in the past 6 months, expect to find the same thing in the housing market. People are selling absolute junk, and they're selling high. In nicer neighborhoods, the price per square foot rivals larger cities (eg, Chicago). Near Notre Dame, the prices are absolutely baffling. We had to double our budget before we found something that checked most of our boxes. We didn't find anything that checked them all.

Our rental home is in the southern part of Granger, where it becomes Mishawaka, and we like the area. Traffic can be a little heavy, but the drivers are mostly courteous. It seems to be safe, and it is close to healthcare facilities and shopping. We actually tried to find a home in the immediate area, but nothing came on the market--at any price--while we were actively looking. 

Our youngest child is attending PHM schools; they're good schools, but WOW, we were not expecting the out-of-pocket costs to be so high. (It was something like $150 in fees for the semester just for books and ""technology licensing"" for a middle schooler.) Maybe all public Indiana schools are like that and we just weren't aware?

I'm slightly familiar with the Georgetown area and the area over toward 933 (not sure if it's also considered Georgetown).  It seems to have pockets of older, smaller homes interspersed with pockets of very large, very new, very expensive homes. The area zones to South Bend schools; the district changes to PHM on the east side of Gumwood Rd. Indiana allows you to apply to send your child to any school, as I understand it, but only magnet program kids at public schools receive bus transportation outside the usual attendance zone. 

Be forewarned that a lot of the houses north of the toll road have well/septic instead of city water/sewer. (Some people are fine with it, but I had poor experiences in the past and didn't want to deal with well or septic issues again.) From what I have seen, most houses in Mishawaka have city water/sewer.

I don't have a specific realtor recommendation, but I do recommend interviewing a few of them before settling on one. Buying a home is a big investment, and it's okay to be picky when choosing an agent. Ask them to send you a few listings via email and see if they understand your wish list before you commit. None of the realtors I have contacted have been remotely surprised that I wanted to give them a ""test run.""",t2_82szrzjm,squirrelsatemyphone,0,1647048924.0,0,t1_i0bfoml,i0bfoml,True,Fireflyy85,t3_t6pvz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthBend/comments/t6pvz7/best_realtor_and_areas_to_live/,Best realtor and areas to live,/r/SouthBend/comments/t6pvz7/best_realtor_and_areas_to_live/i0bfoml/,4,r/SouthBend,0,4

"Yes those three neighborhoods near Notre Dame have been gentrified in the traditional sense of the word. But they make up 6% of the population of the city. One of those - Harter Heights - has been a top 3 neighborhood in terms of cost for basically it's entire 100 year history. It's always been on of the most expensive in SB. 

Price increases on the west side and south east of the city (let alone the entire rest of the city) have simply followed the rise in high prices that the entire nation (and other parts of our county) have followed.  

Is Mishawaka gentrifying? Is Granger gentrifying? Is Edwardsburg? 

They all have seen large price increases - larger than SB - over the last two years but it's not gentrification. Again just using that word for any price increase is reducing the topic of housing to not make any sense.

"I'm a building contractor who does quite a bit of problem solving for my customers. Traveling from job to home centers and back can add a lot of miles to my day. Come spring, and warmer days, I'll revert back to what saved me money, when gas went through the roof in past years. 

Motorcycle + utility trailer. Sound nuts? Not really. Tools dropped into the trailer, a ladder strapped to the top, off I go to work. Most of the time, I can get away with using a six or eight foot ladder for work. Supplies can be hauled that way. ( up to ten feet)  A bike becomes more visible going down the street hauling that around. ( I know that just from the comments I get from drivers at stop lights!) An average 3-4 days a week by bike, with a trip or two by truck, can really add to your bottom line. Customer calls, doing estimates, or just chasing around on two wheels for small stuff doesn't dent your wallet. I'll even do groceries with mine. (A big touring bike can stow away two weeks worth of that, easy) A trailer behind a bike becomes a necessity in times like this. ( Why I own a couple of them.)

What is GOING to make me flinch, is dropping $20 worth of gas into my big touring bike.

Grubhub paid the best before selling. New owners made sure to lower base pay, mass hiring, and mass deactivation of old drivers so they can lie to new drivers that you have to earn your way up in order to get good orders. 

DD just hires everyone so prices are inflated, you have to be very patient to get the good orders. UberEats tips are good but just not as busy.

"Oh good luck with that! I just watched my friends, son go through that. Now, the son was a rock through it all. His father wasn't by a long shot! I became his go to for griping about it.

The son's wife, was a real BUM! She screwed around on him, did drugs, would vanish for days, she was quite the ugly person to all concerned. She even accused both grandparents of abusing the kids. (IT DID NOT HAPPEN!) She is a real nutcase.

Of course, I do know there are always two sides to every argument. My suggestion- think slow, don't react with emotions. Work your problems one at a time. Show that you are the stable party. Keep in mind that kids can be rehearsed and coerced into saying the wrong things at the wrong times. Another friend of mine's, brother, got into hot water over rehearsed lies about him sexually abusing his son, which he did NOT do.

What you HAVE to do, is sit back and wait for your soon-to-be-ex, to hang herself during your proceedings. It will be exasperating for you. Much like what my brother-in-law's EX did to him.

"Call Aardvark pest control, Home Inspections. As a contractor, I hate them. But if I was a buyer, I'd love them. They go through a home with a very fine tooth comb. Everything has to be JUST SO, with them. I did all of the corrections to a ten year old house that failed. (Took me three weeks to correct  all of the builder mistakes)

What you need, is a conscientious contractor that's willing to do the correct job. And, its not a union, or a licenced contractor. In this county, enough money can buy anyone a contractor's licence.  It doesn't matter if you know everything, or nothing about it. They are supposed to pay you back for unfinished, contracted work. You won't get it until put in a claim in on their bond, and sue them.

Contractors come and go in this town. I've seen too many that looked conscientious, had regular business offices, advertised a lot, and bailed in five years or less. Some, no, they are very good and reliable. Your best bet, is hire one that has referrals up the wazoo from former customers.  ( Or in my case, Constant customers.

"For your budget and wanting to be close to Notre Dame, the Near Northwest Neighborhood sounds ideal especially the properties between Portage and the River. 

It's a beautiful neighborhood five min from ND and has been improving a lot over the past two decades. Some of the most beautiful housing stock too. The neighborhood organization is very involved and done much to stabilize the neighborhood, building new homes and rehabbing old ones. 

As for buying old homes, I'd be more comfortable buying an old home with a good inspection than a brand new home. I own a 1930s home and it's built like a tank. Way over engineered and has been great. Everything with houses older than 20 years begins to need replacing so at some point doesn't really matter if a house is from the 80s or the 20s.

"It's crazy right?  You're looking for a 200k house in South Bend, and all we can recommend is places like Near Northwest, River Park, and Mishawaka.  Harter's Heights was a great spot in that price range 18 months ago, but it's probably way out of your price range now.  Same for Swanson Highlands/East Georgetown (especially south of cleveland), which would have been my first recommendation.  Insane where prices went.  $200k was pick of the litter 2 years ago.  


Near Northwest, and really a lot of spots along the river on the west bank, are really neat neighborhoods.  Drive through and check them out.  I've seen some amazing homes there for $200k in the last 6 months of shopping myself.  Those neighborhoods are changing, and will continue to do so as prices skyrocket.  But still check the crime maps on Trulia and other sources, as (as others have said) this town's crime is street by street, especially along the Portage Ave. corridor.  Drive up Portage and make circles through the neighborhoods, you'll see for yourself it changes fast.  


On the fringes of what's acceptable, I'd recommend looking around the tiny home neighborhoods north of Dragoon Trail, say around North of Marian High School.  They're absolutely lower than your budget, and smaller than I think you imagine.  But driving through in summer I've always thought ""What a cute 1950's neighborhood.  If I was a budding family, my kids would have adventures and friends here--befriending an Extra Terrestrial, or fighting an evil clown.""  Just drive through, especially in the spring. You got nothing to lose.  You'll see quick--small, but cute.  Children thick like flies, so watch your speed.  


Keep an eye out and play the long game--but be ready to pounce.  You WILL find some real beauties out here for $180-200k if you're fast.  So don't get discouraged.  Over 6 months of shopping (at the <$150K range) I know I have.  But I've seen some awesome homes come on the market and go to someone much faster than I am.  Don't get discouraged, your home is here somewhere!  


And as for flipped homes, I have a litmus test.  if there's one of those god-awful bowl sinks in the bathroom, or a barn door with no godly reason for existing, I pass it up as a cheap flip.

"Wow. Ok ok ok. Where do I start?!?! 

I was born here in SB then lived on the west coast, then in Mexico, and somehow found my way back here to the 574, or the dirty 71, or whatever u want to call this town, for a number of reasons. But I appreciate you doing your homework and I’m surprised that you’ve gotten a few of these answers / advice. But here goes nothing:

First of all, for $200k you can get a BALLER house. Do you like never talking to neighbors? Like big quickly built homes with septic tanks and wells? Want WASP neighbors? Then granger is perfect for you. The only thing cool about Granger is Barehands brewing. Other than that…well, there’s a reasons townies and locals dog it. It is a zip code full of Karen’s and Chads. 

I recently bought a place in River Park neighborhood…I got a 3 bd 2 ba house with a huge garage and a yard, a block away from Adams HS for $82k. The place was turnkey perfect. Built in 1900. I had help from Rocky Verteramo, a local realtor who I went to school with as a kid. He is Deep South bend blood and is honest. I can’t recommend him enough. 

Now in my opinion the top neighborhoods in SB for first time home buyers are river park / sunnymede area, near northwest neighborhood (Leland, all the way to park avenue and the neighborhood near leeper park / memorial hospital (the historic district), the clay high school area (juniper/Cleveland area up to Auten)…harter heights is awesome, but spendy, and the north shore triangle rocks for great homes which are well built and cared for with cool neighbors. It’s close to nd and the river. 

Look, my dad worked his entire career at ND and the bubble thing is true, but existing in a neighborhood where people do other stuff is all it takes to pop the bubble. This town is rad, in its own way. I’m sure you’ll make it better!
