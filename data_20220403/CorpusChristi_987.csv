"Thank you all for the feed back. I just returned from the DPS/DMV for my renewal. I can confirm that: 

A) going for anything related to test, license renewal etc...its by appointment, which can be done online. The website does state walk-ins are acceptable but on a limited basis. I guess the appointment just makes things smoother/faster. It's the first thing they ask you when you walk in. 

B) you will need your birth certificate. It seems that some laws have changed and it's needed. Once they have it, it's on file. I took my vehicle insurance and registration with me along with my expired DL and the only things they needed were my DL amd birth certificate. 

The whole process wasn't bad at all and it wasn't too busy at the time I went for my appointment 8:20 am. The only exception was I didn't have my birth certificate(I had to go buy a copy) and return with it(about an hour later). I found out that the Vital Records in Corpus is no longer off Greenwood and Horne. It moved to City Hall first floor.

"That guy got elected because people wanted literally ANYONE other than Nelda again. That was made even more abundantly clear when Nelda tried to run again later and had to drop out because she just didn't have the support. 

As for the rest of it that was all blown way out of proportion by a particular news reporter that had made a little name for herself in another city by breaking a big story and I guess saw this as her next big opportunity. She hounded the crap out of that guy including reaching out to family members (including his adult children) in other states to dig up any dirt she could find. She exaggerated some of the claims and made others look way more damning than they would have in another light. She basically pushed him out by her constant hounding and trying to make him look bad. I'm not saying it didn't look bad but a lot of it was innocent twisted to look bad. He never faked any diplomas and that wasn't his wife. It was a friend that also worked for him and since he came in during a water crisis (that actually happened under Nelda's watch btw) he wanted to higher someone quick that he knew had his back since other city officials weren't giving him the time of day. Literally they were not even willing to meet with him because he wasn't one of the good ole boys that has been running this city on backroom deals for decades. 

Again, Please also remember that he was elected because the citizens were desperate for a change. That guy was more surprised than anyone else that he won.

My rule of thumb when fishing the back bays here is that 20+ winds start to make it difficult. The beach almost always has a nice breeze and 16 isn’t bad. Be thoughtful about your setup and make wind breaks. Park your vehicle as a shield. It is fine sand so it will get everywhere. Don’t leave windows down or doors open. Bring a few gallons of water for rinsing sand and salt water off. Also baby powder once rinsed and dry. It can mean the difference between misery and joy.

"Reddit is not a very good resource for this kind of information. You could ask for opinions on ""Utopia"" and you'll still get inundated with ""ThIs plAcE sUx MAn!!"" on a regular basis. The only way to really get a good feel of a community is to visit it personally for at least a weekend, that way you'll at least get some idea of what to expect. Some folks aren't happy no matter where they are, and many have never lived anywhere else so they really develop an unfounded ""grass is greener"" attitude. 

I've lived in quite a few cities, large and small, and Corpus is actually one of the better ones. I've now lived here most of my life, built a career, had my fun, then bought a house and raised a healthy family despite all of the alleged horrors of the area. It did indeed stagnate for way too long, but that's finally beginning to change as the old guard that held the city back eventually dies off. Hopefully this trend will continue and the Sparkling City can finally reach its full potential.

As to your specific lifestyle needs, Corpus is generally pretty chill. There's a few spots downtown with very open-minded hippyish vibe. Plus, there's a growing artistic community you might find interesting. Rockport, my favorite small town, is a short drive away. It's like a mini Austin and is seriously laid back and fun.

I'm not sure why the restaurant scene is getting so much grief, there's some really great places around for almost all tastes (the lack of a proper deli being a glaring exception). As far as beaches go, I'm not a fan of anything on the bay, but the Padre Island National Seashore is a short drive away and is the nicest stretch of unspoiled beach in the state.

"CC is not generally friendly toward minorities. Which is surprising, considering how many Latine/Hispanic people are living here. 

Not exactly LGBTQIA+ friendly, although people aren’t going to run you out with pitchforks. 

Winters can get down into the 30s, but it’s rare. Summers are insanely hot and the humid makes it worse. We got hit by Harvey, but Corpus sustained minimal damage. Hannah hit us, minimal damage as well. Flooding isn’t too worrisome. 

Food is bomb in regards to authentic Mexican and TexMex. There’s tons of fried chicken places though, which is kind of weird. 

Not much to do here if you’re young, which is why a lot of us are trying to leave. There’s the USS Lexington, the Texas State Aquarium, and Dave n Busters. Some arts stuff too. 

I live off of Staples and Saratoga. I live right next to a hospital, across the street from two gas stations, down the street from a fire station, across the street from H‑E‑B (store), right close to Goodwill, and across the street from Walgreens. Also Starbucks, Kohl’s and plenty of food places near me. Walmart isn’t that far to walk to from where I am. PetCo and Earthwise Pets are close, too. Playgrounds I don’t really know that are within walking distance of me. 

Employment isn’t bad, but pay is absolute shit. Minimum wage is $7.25. I can probably get a word in with you for a part time job with Coca Cola, though, where you stock stores. 

I’m not from here originally, moved here in 2013 from AZ and I wish I never did.

Shopping - in a city of almost 350K we have 1 Best Buy, 1 Target, 3 movie theaters (but only 2 are worth going to), Grocery choices are HEB & Wal-Mart, Finally one Mall that should be dead but is basically on life support.

Bars - A few good craft cocktail bars but most bars are Bro bars.

Live music - Unless it’s a local playing plan to go to San Antonio. 

Weather - Hot and humid for 9 months. When it does get cold here it FEELS way colder than anywhere else I’ve been. I was just in Salt Lake City, it was 30 and snowing and it was pleasant. It’s hard to explain but the wind and humidity here make even 45-50 feel really cold.

I moved here for kiteboarding, though my parents moved here for the beach years ago. I never lived with them while they were here.

This is the best coastal place for kiteboarding in the US. Some say the best in the world. I would put Corpus in the top 10 at the very least.

The Mexican food is everywhere and is mostly passable, but not spectacular.

Car stuff: Most everyone covered that. Perhaps if you lived at 6 points or near an HEB you would be ok. I have a place that I'm getting ready to sell on Staples near Ray High School. The location is great. I do bike ride from there regularly. I had a roomie that took the bus to the mall for work for a couple of years and never had a car.

Corpus might be cool in 10-20 years (anyone trying to tell you otherwise is lying to themselves).",t2_velum,pfunkapocalypse,0,1645501514.0,0,t1_hxx71ak,hxx71ak,False,WestCoastWuss619,t3_sy7yhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/corpus/comments/sy7yhm/moving_questions/,Moving Questions,/r/corpus/comments/sy7yhm/moving_questions/hxx71ak/,5,r/corpus,0,5
"Preface: White, female, Heterosexual, married with children. Been living here close to 10 years, originally from Houston. I have visited several places in the north east, I have family up in Queens and Long Island, and have taken several trips up to the finger Lakes.

Is there anywhere to walk that is of quality? No. It’s possible to drive somewhere, such as downtown, walk around the marina, possibly grab a bite to eat, but then you all have to drive to go anywhere else. Most grocery stores, restaurants, etc are a few miles away from where most of the prime apartments are. 

Additionally, there are only say, maybe three months? out of the year when the temperatures outside are even OK to walk around in. Basically in Spring/Fall expect highs in the upper 80s to 90s, with summers going into the 100’s. We ran our air conditioner on Christmas day. We’ve turned the heat on maybe five times this winter. It’s horribly humid, think well over 90%, with the only saving grace being the wind. If you do go for a walk, you’re going to get sweaty. By walk I mean going from inside to your car. It seriously feels like I’m dying when I have to walk to my car after it’s been in the sun. 

Things to do? That is very subjective. If you enjoy fishing, going to the beach, or drinking lots of beer, this is definitely the place for you.  I have a three year old, and struggle to find parks where the equipment is not rated for someone ages 5 to 12, and the nice parks are decent drive from our house (south side). Before Covid, the parks and recreation department did a relatively OK job of hosting activities during the summer, but most of those have gone to the wayside. Also, most of these events were geared towards families; unless y’all have kiddos, you’re probably going to struggle to find things to do besides go to a bar.

CC does have some nice bars. But very FEW restaurants that are not chains. Most of the Mexican food down here is very Tex-Mex. It is extremely carb heavy; lots of rice, refried beans, tortillas with a bit of lettuce/tomatoes/cheese/meat thrown in. I think we might be the diabetic capital of TX. (Others will have to correct me here if I’m wrong) I also think that the majority of the restaurants here are all owned by just a few people, and there are multiple locations for each one.  

Apartment living: we bought our house in 2019. Prior to that we have lived in several apartments. We were told at a few locations that the occupancy rate is close to 95 or 100% at most facilities, and they can basically charge whatever they want to for rent. Housing shortage. We were paying the same amount as a cousin up in Virginia for a two bedroom apartment. Depending where you were looking, the age of the apartment, as well as the “amenities”, you could be paying upwards of $2000 per month. 

LGTBQ: every once in a while you might run into that one asshole that’s going to be a total D bag. Otherwise I would say that this area is pretty tolerant of most lifestyles. There used to be a few night clubs and bars that were LGTBQ hot spots, but I honestly don’t even know if they exist anymore. 

I’m sure this is coming across pretty negative, I’ll be honest with you we’re looking to move out of the area. If you have the time, I would take a trip to all of the cities that you’re looking at, and really weigh your options. But also consider that if you’re really looking for that ‘urban, apartment dwelling, walk everywhere vibe’, there are only a few handful of places in Texas that will provide that, and you will pay a premium to live there. The first places that come to mind are downtown Austin, downtown/uptown Houston, select parts of downtown San Antonio, and potentially parts of downtown Dallas (someone from Dallas will have to weigh in more here, we’ve only been to a few places in Dallas, so I don’t feel equipped to answer). Texas is really just too hot, and people don’t like being sweaty.

I’m happy to answer any other questions you might have.",t2_zyjr1o0,NurseK89,0,1645499578.0,0,t1_hxx31g2,hxx31g2,True,WestCoastWuss619,t3_sy7yhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/corpus/comments/sy7yhm/moving_questions/,Moving Questions,/r/corpus/comments/sy7yhm/moving_questions/hxx31g2/,9,r/corpus,0,9
"Corpus Christi is not walkable and the public transportation sucks. As others have said, the beaches are dirty, we are on the wrong side of the Gulf of Mexico where all the trash from the Mississippi River is pushed by currents and the prevailing wind. If you don’t have a vehicle you are lost. 
Extremely conservative rednecks all over the town, far from accepting people that don’t toe the line as to what they expect. 
As an example there is an active group here trying to raise one million dollars to build the worlds largest Christian cross. That is their idea of Christianity- it’s all for show. 
I also returned because of aged, ill parents, got too anchored and can’t leave. 
Unless you are into killing things (fishing and hunting) there’s not a damn thing to do. 
During the summer the heat and humidity is miserable. Once you get here it takes forever to go anywhere. Get a map and draw an arc one hundred miles radius of Corpus Christi, and you will see there is nothing here. San Antonio is 143 miles away. 
To fly out of Corpus Christi the planes only go to Dallas or Houston. There are no direct flights anywhere else. 
I will sum up with this, for 70 years Corpus Cristi has been on the verge of greatness and has never made it,and never will. The same families that have pulled the political strings are still pulling them. 
Austin is expensive,CC is not cheap, but as far as natural disasters go the odds of it happening here are a hell of a lot greater than Austin.

"Hey there!

Born and raised in corpus. I’m a half white/half Hispanic F. The local scene (stores/businesses) in corpus is very accepting of everyone, but corpus is still pretty red. Unfortunately it seems to be split down the middle of people who are accepting of all peoples and those who are not. 

Definitely will need a car, Corpus Christi has a bad track record of being incredibly unkind and dangerous for pedestrians/bikers. 

There are a few plazas that you can walk to a few different shops, but those are far and few in between here. I know local places always seem to be hiring too, so that may be a good place to look. 

Corpus has really worked on growing the local art scene too. We have an art walk the first Friday of every month, a farmers market every Wednesday at the art museum, and a farmers market somewhere on the south side of corpus on Saturday mornings. 

There’s places to look for local stuff (which is always the most fun IMO) if you dig for it. Best of luck!

Austin is much better than Corpus. My adult child is trans and he gets nasty comments at work.  This isn't a town where you can be who you want. The population is mostly Hispanic. The food isn't that wonderful and there isn't much to do here unless your into fishing and beach stuff. Corpus has lower pay than Austin San Antonio or Houston and a high cost of living. Property taxes are high and go up yearly. Most of the roads are in terrible condition and it floods when it storms thru out Corpus.

"Howdy -- I will preface this with I am a white straight person who grew up in Corpus and only visit now. I know your experiences could vary. 

With that said, I think Corpus will generally be a pretty good fit. I have dated people different from me and experienced zero feelings/vibes of not being welcomed. Corpus is pretty down to earth and chill. 

Summer is wet -- and I mean wet like the air is moist and it will be above 90 degrees the entire time. The good thing is, Corpus is exceptionally windy. 

Winters are very mild (excluding the hell that was Feb 2021). 

I would not stress on hurricanes. We get a scare every few years, but there has only been one major hurricane in the past few decades. 

There are a few decent Mexican restaurants, but you will not find the Mexican food you are looking for (San Antonio has more authentic true Mexican food). What you will find is a plethora of wonderful Tex-Mex places. I also love the food scene in Corpus - it is surprisingly good.

There is only really one grocery store that is worth shopping at and it is HEB. Walkability is not a thing, unfortunately, and the bus routes are not well run compared to other large cities. 

Places may not advertise openings on Indeed, make sure to check LinkedIn and Google in general. HEB is almost always hiring and there is a shortage of food industry employees. I would also advise you to research the industries in town and see if you would be a good fit there (oil/gas/boating/military/etc).

I have met quite a few transplants in the last few years. Most of my childhood friends are gone, but I still see many young people moving to town.

"so, I noticed there's a carnival that has set up shop near there, in the parking lot outside Bel's Furniture. (btw is Bel's just Wilcox with new branding? Their billboards use that same doofy woman as the display model)

TLDR that carnival is a huuuuuuuuuuge ripoff. They only have like 6 rides, half of which look lame AF (teeny tiny Ferris wheel; bumper cars; itty bitty merry-go-round) and most of the others look too dangerous (that loop-de-loop thing where they leave you stuck upside down for like 20 seconds). The only one that looks decent is ""Starship"" which is the thing where you get flung against the inner wall by centripetal force, and the floor drops out, so it's a good thrill but still somewhat safe

To ride the rides you need to either buy tokens, or buy an arm band. Tokens cost $1 each and you need 4 to 6 tokens to ride any ride, even the lame shit. Arm bands let you ride any ride as often as you'd like, so that's the better deal if you & the crew are gonna be there all day ... but arm bands are flippin $30 each

Besides the rides there are like 6 food trailers, and nearly **alllllll** of their shit is mad overpriced. Like think of what you'd pay at a fast food joint or convenience store... then double it. $8 for a slice of pizza or $27 for a whole pie; $18 for a turkey leg; $10 for funnel cake; $10 for ribbon fries (as in, take one big potato & cut it into one lonnnnnnnnng thin ribbon, but the whole thing goes cold on you after 5 to 10 minutes)

the one decent thing there, as in the price isn't too crazy since you can't really get the item elsewhere easily, were the fried Oreos (lol). one truck had em at $7 for a set of 5; another had em for $8. No idea why the prices were different when the trailers were right next to each other

"The downfall of Sunrise Mall began with the Padre-Staples Mall expansion and upgrade. The owners of Sunrise delayed their own upgrade, and cheaped out on their businesses. Their expansion came too late, as business there was already declining. To recoup more revenue, the owners raised rents, which forced out some businesses. 

The remaining anchor stores, like Mervyn's and Montgomery Ward, succumbed to the bankruptcy of their parent companies. The main mall lost stores as air-conditioning and other electric services became sporadic.

When I see people keep saltwater fish they've caught from Cole Park Pier, the North Beach jetty at the USS Lexington, etc. and they take it home to eat it, I fear they have no clue what they're putting into their bodies but that's just me.",t2_c4jybdgp,Corpusfishingguy,0,1643454346.0,0,t1_huph99z,huph99z,True,BrutalJuice917,t3_sbyi57,https://www.reddit.com/r/corpus/comments/sbyi57/know_what_this_town_needs_more_of/,Know what this town needs more of?,/r/corpus/comments/sbyi57/know_what_this_town_needs_more_of/huph99z/,1,r/corpus,0,1
"So RIGHT NOW and in the last few years, work, the smell of fresh air (currently!) the ocean, the bays, the fresh seafood, the ability to walk by the water for miles, the seagulls squawking, the lack of massive congestion/traffic jams we endured in the huge city we moved here from, the slower pace of life... plus we have amazing neighbors.   See comments below as much of this will sadly change soon and we will be leaving.

But yes, I can see why people hate this place, ha ha.   Terrible streets, many areas always under construction, nothing ever seems to get finished... or even remotely finished on time.   Lazy, stupid, uninformed citizens and very low voter turnout... and they vote for whoever is already in office time and again... and then wonder out loud why nothing changes!?   Very very corrupt city and county officials trying to keep Corpus stuck in about, oh, 1975 with only oil, gas, natural gas and plastics industry corporate folks given much of our tax dollars instead of fixing the streets, investing in education, doing something about the tens of thousands of abandoned homes and business buildings here, etc. etc.

In survey after survey, students of Texas A&M CC and Del Mar college, over 90% of students polled say they are leaving Corpus as soon as possible after graduating.

I'm also stunned at how many small minded idiot folks think everyone should LOVE to work for oil and gas companies.

We're only here for four more years and then are retiring up north a few hours.   We may or may not keep our home and rent it out or may sell it.    There are so many industry projects being built and almost all are going to use our bays and close by ocean waters as toilets and all of our Texas entities approve all of their applications to pollute and if the waters here are so polluted the fishing is ruined and there are dead birds, turtles, fish, etc. floating around, who would want to stay in such a place?

Currently last I heard there are close to 50 new factories being applied for and/or built and 7 desalination plants have permits processed and each desal plant will dump around 100 million gallons of toxic briny chemical laden discharge water right into our local bays... and our bay system is not near enough large nor is there enough fresh saltwater coming in from the ocean to clean that much pollution.

And in our neighborhood the average age on our street / of our neighbors is 73 as it's a very old established neighborhood... and three of the residents have passed in the last 2 years... and we're not huge fans of the new folks who bought their houses from their children who sold them soon after they passed and we're not fans of unfriendly folks we have to live near.

(This last February I helped about half a dozen elderly neighbor wrap their pipes in preparation for the freeze and I made the mistake of knocking on the door of one of the new neighbors and asking him if he wanted help wrapping his pipes and he acted angry I dared knock on his door.    And of course, he was a young fool who did not wrap them and his pipes froze and he had plumbers out to fix his cracked outside faucets...)

besides, if you don't want to spend $10 or whatever at Quick Quack, you can always shell out $2 in quarters at an old-style car wash like the one at Gollihar and Weber.

All three different companies tested the water and found a lot of rock/hardness, excess chlorine and various other contaminants.  


We wound up with a softener refiner that removes hardness, most chlorine and sediment and a reverse osmosis drinking and cooking water system.  


My wife is happy but yes, we've had it for a few months now and got used to having nice, clean, safer water... then recently got invited over to a neighbor's backyard bbq and had some of their water and it was disgusting!  It smelled a little and I held the glass up to the light and swear I saw particles in it... yuck.
