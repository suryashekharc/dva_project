"I‚Äôm from Muskegon and I could sit and tell you so many things I love about our town! First of all I‚Äôm a history buff, and the entire area is crammed full of such rich history and intrigue. Downtown is full of some really beautiful architecture, as well as some abandoned buildings, but even those somehow add character to our town. The overall feeling of Muskegon is laid back, friendly, and overall pretty accepting. We have bike time in the summer, a festival for motorcycles and their riders to celebrate and have a good time. We have so many great breweries that have started popping up and lining western avenue, as well as live music at bars or outside (AND there‚Äôs a social drinking district now ;)). As for the summertime, being a local means you know where all of the best beaches are, and everyone has a favorite. I honestly tend to become a tourist in grand haven during the summers, taking a drive downtown and to the beach just to experience all of the people and things to do! I stay in Muskegon during the summertime to enjoy the serene hiking trails and beaches, possibly followed by a drive along the main beach to catch the sunset without too many cars or people blocking the view. It‚Äôs a calmer and less traveled place than the surrounding beach towns, but I think that makes it a hidden gem.

"What is really sad about this is that there is an elevation drop from most of downtown Muskegon as you walk toward the lakefront.  So if an overpass started at, say, the corner of Western and Third, it could go all the across Shoreline Drive without there being any need for stairs, and with very little (if any) additional elevation needed.  Then on the lakefront side there is plenty of room for some kind of gradual ramp that could end next to the existing parking lot.  So you would have a system that is friendly to pedestrians, bicyclists (even if they have to walk their bikes), and even wheelchairs.  Alternately it could be done at Western & Fifth, the distance might be a bit shorter (possibly lower construction costs) but at that point I don't think there is as much of a natural elevation drop going out across Shoreline, and also it's not as close to the heart of downtown which is where I'm sure they would like to funnel people into during major events.",t2_14zi27,AStrowger,0,1647798608.0,0,t1_i1fgj2v,i1fgj2v,False,daytripper96,t3_them8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muskegon/comments/them8w/shoreline_drive_in_muskegon_will_be_only_2_lanes/,Shoreline Drive in Muskegon will be only 2 lanes this summer as part of an experimental 'road diet',/r/Muskegon/comments/them8w/shoreline_drive_in_muskegon_will_be_only_2_lanes/i1fgj2v/,4,r/Muskegon,0,4

"I'm really excited for this trial. I've read a lot about road diets and how they affect traffic, and I've been thinking it would be perfect for shoreline.

"MUSKEGON, MI ‚Äì The four-lane Shoreline Drive along Muskegon Lake near downtown will be reduced to two lanes this summer, and depending on how traffic flows the change could become permanent.

The pilot project initiated by the city of Muskegon is part of its efforts to better bridge Muskegon Lake and amenities along its shoreline with downtown. The road, which is Business Route U.S. 31, drives a wedge between the lake and downtown.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of a desire to reconnect downtown to the waterfront and also to slow traffic and make that a little more pedestrian friendly down there,‚Äù Muskegon Public Works Director Leo Evans told MLive/The Muskegon Chronicle.

One lane in each direction of the divided boulevard will be shut down between Southern Avenue and Terrace Street between June and October, according to a request for proposals from engineers to help the city implement the pilot project.

That time period purposely covers the busy summer season when festivals, including the Christian Unity Music Festival, occur at Heritage Landing located along the targeted section of Shoreline Drive.

The road narrowing also will be in place during the Michigan Irish Festival, which will be held at Heritage Landing in September.

An average of 20,000 vehicles travel Shoreline Drive each day in the summer, Evans said.

The road also is heavily traveled during the Rebel Road and Muskegon Bike Time motorcycle events in July.

‚ÄúIt is truly an experiment,‚Äù Evans said. ‚ÄúIf it doesn‚Äôt work, it will go away.‚Äù

The pilot project even will be ended prior to October if it causes too many problems, he said.

But if the ‚Äúroad diet‚Äù is accomplished without major disruptions, the city will begin negotiating with the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) on how to make the change permanent, Evans said. MDOT has control of the road that connects Seaway Drive with Moses Jones Parkway.

‚Äú(MDOT officials) want the city to prove the concept,‚Äù he said.

Shoreline Drive separates downtown from Pigeon Hill Brewing Company‚Äôs Brewer‚Äôs Lounge, the Aquastar Cruises dock, the LST 393 World War II museum ship, the Shoreline Inn, Lake House Waterfront Grille, Terrace Point Marina and the Terrace Point Landing housing development.

The new VanDyk Mortgage Convention Center is on the downtown side of Shoreline Drive and has entrances off the busy boulevard.

If Shoreline Drive eventually is narrowed, the city‚Äôs preference is to remove the grassy terrace and only use one side of the divided highway, Evans said.

There are 10 intersections in the study area, six of them regulated with traffic signals.

A significant part of the pilot project is studying how the narrowing of Shoreline Drive impacts motorists‚Äô habits, including whether they choose to use other streets to reach their destinations and if that creates other complications, Evans said.

The study of motorists‚Äô habits will be accomplished through the efforts of city staff, MDOT, the West Michigan Shoreline Regional Development Commission and whatever engineering firm is chosen through the request for proposals process, Evans said.

The western section of Shoreline Drive was completed in 1994, and the eastern portion was finished 10 years later.

It was developed to provide better access to the waterfront, and also diverted traffic from the parallel Muskegon and Webster avenues, which previously were two-lane, one-way roads through a residential area.

In 2015, 10-block stretches of Muskegon and Webster were narrowed and returned to ‚Äúquiet streets‚Äù after having served as the main highway into town before Shoreline Drive was constructed.",t2_16j0ds,daytripper96,0,1647636415.0,0,t1_i178ssk,i178ssk,True,daytripper96,t3_them8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muskegon/comments/them8w/shoreline_drive_in_muskegon_will_be_only_2_lanes/,Shoreline Drive in Muskegon will be only 2 lanes this summer as part of an experimental 'road diet',/r/Muskegon/comments/them8w/shoreline_drive_in_muskegon_will_be_only_2_lanes/i178ssk/,10,r/Muskegon,0,10

"I was born and raised in Muskegon but aside from some of the music festivals (summer celebration, Rothebury/electric forest, bike time) tourism hasn‚Äôt impacted my life much in the summer months. Mostly because these events happen in an isolated area of the town.
However that being said. I lived for 7 years in Grand Haven. That town is awful in the summer months if you‚Äôre a local-especially if you‚Äôre a teen trying to grow up in an area that caters to tourists more than to the residents who live there. 
My family would purposely leave town during the weekend coast guard festival. If we couldn‚Äôt leave we rarely joined in on the festivities.
Traffic is a mess, the beach is packed, downtown is swarming with tourists.
That‚Äôs just my take on that town versus Muskegon. 
I love Muskegon because it ISNT Grand Haven or Traverse City. 
There is culture here. Diversity. Grit and pride to be on the lake but not conform to a stereotypical beach town. Yeah a lot of investors are coming into the area and buying out abandoned/empty property lots on Muskegon Lake and It does cause concern over how it will impact our city. Still, this place will stay true to being a little gem that embraces not being as conformist as other beach front towns.

"Grew up in Muskegon, left in 2005, found ourselves in Florida 2018-last summer, and then moved to Ottawa County. Am happy as a clam. I do not miss sweltering humidity, mold, wearing bugspray every time I set foot outside, horrifyingly bad governance, and underfunded everything. 

Other than the 3 years we were in Florida, we were cold climate folks. This winter has been okay but I'm more than ready for the end of it. 

Cost of living is around the same but in my world (education) the wages and conditions are incomparably better. Like not even close.

"Meijer is the big local grocery store chain. No idea if that's equivalent to Publix though.

Grand Haven's a bit more expensive, but is where stuff's happening. I live on the other side of Muskegon County and most of the younger people I work with live in Grand Haven or Norton Shores and commute to work. Which seems crazy to me but there must be something good happening down there for them to want to live around there. I assume.

Also, to keep busy in the winter, the Winter Sports Complex at Muskegon State Park is pretty good. And in general, you'll be within an hour's drive of five nice lakeside state parks, plus many miles of bike trails, so you're covered if you like outdoors stuff.

If you're more of an indoor person, you're not far from GR and only three hours from Chicago (third largest city in the US).

I'm not really sure about the job market but I'm constantly seeing manufacturing places hiring so I imagine there are professional jobs to go along with the more entry level stuff, depending on what you do. However, in my experience wages are a bit lower since the big companies take advantage of low cost of living to also pay you less. At my company, we all make way less than they do at other locations, but of course it works out to be not that bad thanks to the cost of living. But then when you retire, you'll basically be locked into living in a cheaper area since your retirement savings will be sized according to where you were working.

If housing cost is significant to you, you may want to consider going out into the country a bit, depends on how close you want to be to town I guess. Housing costs are going up all over but I think they're still OK around here. It'll probably depend more on where you get a job at though. Living close to work saves you SO MUCH money, you have no idea.

"The crime in that area is not the ‚Äúviolent crime‚Äù that occurs in the heights. Even the crime that happens in the heights is isolated to individuals who are getting involved in situations. It isn‚Äôt random acts of violences against unsuspecting strangers.
As far as Nims, I love the area. The bike path is right there, you‚Äôre close enough to bike downtown while also in an area where getting your groceries on Henry doesn‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äútrip to the grocery store‚Äù.
There are good local businesses around that area from Fatty lumpkins, Wayne‚Äôs Deli, coffee factory. It‚Äôs in the city of Muskegon which means a free parking pass to the beach during the summer. 
I am in Glenside currently, but Nims is a great location as well. The only difference really is how people take care of their homes. In Glenside the majority of te neighborhood is elderly and a lot of people really take care of their property. In Nims there are more rentals. More people who might not keep up with curb side appeal‚Ä¶ but it is the up and coming neighborhood in the city and realtors know that and are pushing to make it a ‚Äúhip‚Äù place to be.

Malinda Pego-

""Black History Month? 
There it is! They can either have the truth or bury it but they can‚Äôt shine it up.
 I NEVER said to celebrate a slave owner...the NEWS said that. Recognizing early black achievement even during the slave era...I guess they dont care that a black man could DO something and win in REAL legitimized racism...1860s should be worse than 1960s. 

A man pulls himself out of the depths of nothing and builds a success, takes care of people better than all the white men ever did, and they complain about it. I guess they finally admitted history and slavery wasn't a one way street. 

But they'll bury history. 

I guess next up is the fact that my Native American ancestors in the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee & Virginia  weren't slaves or driven off their land...
*btw, ""takes care of people better"" I mean black slaves. He tried. But...also he was part of the system.

Look up other BHM heroes...how many were adulterers, pimps, drug dealers, killers? Think about it. 

But NONE of them actually did these:
1) came OUT of slavery, and
2) became successful, 
3) WHILE slavery was still in existence

***News Flash to the News: if youre going to learn ""history"" then you better learn about ALL of History.***

BTW my husband is Native American. My children part Indian. The very county I represent is a Native American word.

Why are you focusing on slavery than this black American who came OUT of slavery and succeeded in life WHILE slavery was still a thing? 
Are you hiding history or just ashamed of it? 
Every civilization and culture had history. We learn of the Pharoahs...and they had slaves. We learn of the Caesars...the very word ""slave"" came from the Slavic (eastern European) peoples they enslaved. The English and Scots enslaved one another for years. The Vikings enslaved Europeans and sold them to Masters in African ports. Why is it any surprise Ellison would be different?

Its because he WAS different. 
How many Slaves can you think of that became free and then so SUCCESSFUL in life they bought a Governors Mansion? 
Did YOU ever buy ANYTHING from a governor?
 Let alone a Mansion? Do you even own a mansion? No, of course not. Because you did not live the life or have the skills that Mr Ellison had. So again, are you hiding history or ashamed of it?

I stand with TRUTH, and an ex slave becoming a success while slavery yet existed is UNHEARD of in 5000 years of recorded human history. But it happened here in America. But maybe you‚Äôre ashamed of America too.

BTW it was me- a Republican that introduced and read a BHM resolution in the first place.  It was MOTIONED by CHAIR BOB SCOLNIK, seconded by Commissioner Rillastine Wilkins and voted on in MAJORITY and PASSED  into the full board.  It wasn‚Äôt until after I introduced one they came back two days later with one. 
And it was ME that mentioned and insisted adding our own Muskegon County Commissioner Rillastine Wilkins to their resolution.  Recognizing her lifelong achievements in Muskegon while she is still here.  
I voted for theirs as well. And recommended adding the pioneer of medical achievements of neuroscience by Dr, Benjamin Carson, they said no.  
This is the resolution I presented and read first, CHAIR BOB SCOLNIK MOTIONED and Commissioner Rillastine Wilkins seconded:
RESOLUTION
The Muskegon County Board of Commissioners hereby, and in Unanimous Recognition and Celebration of the significance of Black History Month, agree in Bi-Partisan Unison:
Whereas a fitting theme for February 2022 is ‚ÄúThe Black Family: Representation, Identity, and Diversity‚Äù, which emphasizes how the representation, identity, and diversity of the Black family have been reverenced, stereotyped, and vilified during & since slavery;
Whereas enslaved Africans in America were not legally allowed to marry in any Southern States until the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified in 1865;
Whereas even in Southern States where marriage was illegal, many enslaved people entered into relationships that they treated like marriage, considering themselves husbands and wives although their unions were not allowed by their Masters;
Whereas some Black slaves lived in nuclear families with a mother, father, and children when they all belonged to the same owner;
Whereas, in other cases, the father might have a different owner than the mother and children and might travel several miles away on a distant plantation and walk, which was usually permissible on Wednesday nights and Sunday evenings, to see his family as his obligation to provide labor for an owner took precedence over his personal needs;
Whereas mothers cooked meals in the fireplace and sewed or quilted late into the night while fathers fished and hunted, sometimes with their sons, to provide food to supplement the rations provided by Owners;
Whereas enslaved people held parties and prayer meetings in cabins or far out in the woods beyond the hearing range of their Masters;
Whereas enslaved Black families lived with the perpetual possibility of separation caused by the sale of one or more family members by their Owners;
Whereas it is estimated that approximately one-third of enslaved children in the Southern States experienced family separation in one of three possible scenarios: sale away from parents; sale with mother away from father; or sale of mother or father away from child;
Whereas despite this all, Freed Black men and women persevered, and attained Heights of Achievement unforeseen before being Freed;
Whereas William Ellison of South Carolina was among the First Freed Black Men to Prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the ability of Free Black Men to attain the Trade Skills, Equal Pay for Equal Work, Own Property, and set the Example for Attaining Wealth and Prosperity to other Freed Black men hitherto unseen,
Whereas William Ellison learned the skillful art of the day known as Blacksmithing, crafting all implements for the Modern Society of his Day, with customers of all backgrounds, races, and creeds, his work highly prized and paid for by all,
Whereas William Ellison used his newfound skills and freedom to purchase lands and provide work and welfare, housing and rations, to other black families,
Whereas William Ellison managed for the care of black families without the assistance of White Masters, and continued to prospers,
Whereas William Ellison became one of the First prosperous farmers and landholders in South Carolina, ensuring many of his fellow black men & women were gainfully employed and looked after,
Whereas after sound business practice and careful management of his skilled and unskilled laborers alike, William Ellison became the first Freed Black Man to purchase, under contract, the Mansion of a former White Governor of the State of South Carolina,
Now, Therefore let it be Resolved, in Recognition of the Duly Recognized Contributions, Success, and Example to All Americans, and in the Spirit of Diversity & Inclusion, the Muskegon County Board of Commissioners hereby salute and recognize William Ellison as among the first Free Black Slaves to join the fabric of Human History in the United States of America.""",t2_4dmkpz6a,possumproblems,0,1645163525.0,0,t1_hxewaow,hxewaow,True,possumproblems,t3_sui38z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muskegon/comments/sui38z/muskegon_county_commissioner_malinda_pego/,Muskegon County commissioner Malinda Pego attempts and fails to honor black slave owner,/r/Muskegon/comments/sui38z/muskegon_county_commissioner_malinda_pego/hxewaow/,2,r/Muskegon,0,2

Honestly, as someone who lived in GR, I think Muskegon is significantly more convenient in getting things. Pre-pandemic, you never waited in a line to get into a restaurant (its a bit different during covid), there is always accessible parking downtown, residents get free beach parking. We live in Nim's and we are a short stop from just about anything we need literally 5 to 10 minutes for Meijer, restaurants, and bars. Best of all, no 28th street traffic. (wasted years of time life sitting in traffic on that road)

However, I would caution you to not expect Muskegon to be similar to GR. If you move to Muskegon and hold it to GR's measuring stick, you'll only see flaws.

As for queer friendly, I can only speak for my neighborhood, but there are lots of pride flags in Nims.

"This area is a mixed neighborhood and I've considered many houses in this area for similar reasons. As for Muskegon, I'd argue it's close to everything it has to offer. As far as doordash/Uber/Lyft, it's available but much more difficult than GR. Thankfully companies have invested in the downtown area and has begun to turn around the past ~5 years. Laketon has a path, which I forget the name, but it takes you to the Lakeshore walkway which ends down by Muskegon lake marinas/shops/bars etc (lakeside neighborhood). Same trail east goes to downtown Muskegon, heritage landing, breweries, to north Muskegon/causeway. I enjoyed this on my bicycle often!

Edited to address last question: 
I don't think you will find many if any shops that openly support or fly a pride flag. As far as political signs you will certainly see mixed red/blue. Progressive materials are ~25 years behind gr. Currently in the market to buy as well. Anything from Muskegon to GR, much different in GR how many people look ahead.

"Welcome! 

Check out the[ Manistee River Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/michigan/manistee-river-trail-south). You have the option to do an out-and-back hike on the MRT (east side of the river) or a complete loop utilizing the North Country Trail on the west side of the river (collectively referred to as the [Manistee River Trail Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/michigan/the-manistee-river-trail). I park and begin at the[ Red Bridge River Access](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hmnf/recreation/camping-cabins/recarea/?recid=18598&actid=29) at the south end of the trail. That page also has a link to a map with the designated campsites (or you can disperse camp within NFS guidelines). Plenty of water access via creeks or the river on the MRT side, but there's almost no access on the NCT side, so plan appropriately. The MRT is probably the most popular trail in the LP, so it can get busy on the weekends. I usually go during the week and only run into a handful of people.

I don't have any experience with them, but look into the Jordan River Valley Trail and Nordhouse Dunes.

*Whitmer was interviewed on WOOD-TV in Grand Rapids. She was asked about re-imposing restrictions and responded the surge is being driven by unvaccinated people.

"MUSKEGON COUNTY, MI ‚Äì Two Muskegon County commissioners, one of whom said it wasn‚Äôt the county‚Äôs business to ‚Äúsave lives,‚Äù tried to dismantle and liquidate its hazardous materials response team.  
  
They failed.  
  
The idea to ‚Äúeliminate the HAZMAT team and liquidate its assets‚Äù was presented by Commissioner Zach Lahring as a way to save money to store the emergency response team‚Äôs equipment.  
  
In 2020, the county‚Äôs general fund paid $16,050 to support the HAZMAT team while this year the amount, as of Sept. 30, is not quite $12,000, according to county figures.  
  
Costs of storage, which HAZMAT currently doesn‚Äôt pay but will have to start paying, ranged from less than $6,000 to $9,800 annually.  
  
Lahring, a Ravenna Republican, first introduced the motion, to the surprise of other commissioners, at the board‚Äôs ways and means committee, which is a committee of the whole, on Nov. 1. It was tabled until Tuesday, Nov. 16, when it came to a vote and failed.

Lahring‚Äôs sole supporter was Holton Republican Malinda Pego ‚Äì who previously proposed with Lahring such failed ideas as allowing half the county to explore secession.  
  
Pego argued that the team that responds to hazardous chemical spills and releases isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúservice the county is supposed to provide.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWe are not constitutionally mandated, we take an oath to the Constitution, and I will not vote for it, not because I don‚Äôt think it has value but because it is not a service that the county is supposed to provide,‚Äù Pego said Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe are not in the market to save people‚Äôs lives. That‚Äôs not what the county governance is for.‚Äù  
  
Her statement was received with chuckles from a few commissioners.  
  
County board Vice Chair Charles Nash, who recounted an incident where he saw emergency responders ‚Äúrunning to the hazard‚Äù while he went home feeling deeply disturbed, said he did see responsibility in saving people‚Äôs lives.  
  
‚ÄúI think we are in the business of trying to save lives or at least give people a better quality of life,‚Äù said Nash, a Muskegon Democrat. ‚ÄúI think if my kid was stuck in a HAZMAT situation, I definitely would want this team out there trying to get him out of it.‚Äù

The HAZMAT team is comprised of 14 members, most of whom work for local fire departments, team Chief Tony Gutierrez told commissioners. Members have specialized training and equipment and provide support and advice to area fire departments responding to everything from ‚Äúwhite powder calls‚Äù to chemical cloud releases, he said.  
  
One problem with Lahring‚Äôs proposal to ‚Äúliquidate‚Äù the team‚Äôs assets is that they were purchased with federal funds and would be required to be turned in for use by another HAZMAT team.  
  
When he introduced the idea Nov. 1, Lahring proposed that the HAZMAT team‚Äôs functions could be handled by private ‚Äúcleanup‚Äù companies. He also said he had been told that the team had not been used for a couple of years.  
  
Nash objected to voting on the measure Nov. 1 ‚Äì with all but Lahring and Pego agreeing to table it until Tuesday ‚Äì and said he didn‚Äôt trust what Lahring was saying was factual.  
  
Indeed, Gutierrez on Tuesday corrected Lahring, saying there were ‚Äúfull team‚Äù responses on seven occasions in 2020 and three times this year. There also was one phone consultation in 2020 and two in 2021.  
  
The fact there were a ‚Äúsmall number‚Äù of incidents is a ‚Äúgood thing,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want a HAZMAT team responding to hundreds of incidents within the county,‚Äù Gutierrez said.  
  
He also clarified that HAZMAT does not perform any cleanup, but rather works to stop or mitigate the release of hazardous materials into the environment.  
  
‚ÄúThat skill is not something you will get on a regular basis from any local cleanup company,‚Äù said Muskegon County HAZMAT Deputy Chief Christopher Dean, who also is the Muskegon Heights fire chief. ‚ÄúThe key difference with the hazardous materials response team that you have in your county‚Ä¶is that the responsibility for us is to protect the citizens and the environment in an emergency phase.‚Äù  
  
Among the cited critical incidents that the HAZMAT team has responded to were the 2014 release of a chlorine cloud at Michigan‚Äôs Adventure that injured 63, including 28 who were taken to the hospital; the 1999 death of a Whitehall Leather trucker who accidentally mixed chemicals and caused a hydrogen sulfide release that killed him; and a 2000 explosion at the Lomac chemical company that injured 10 workers.  
  
‚ÄúWhen we need it, we need it,‚Äù Commissioner Marcia Hovey-Wright, a Democrat from Muskegon, said of the HAZMAT team. ‚ÄúThe cost is minimal to our budget.‚Äù  
  
Lahring said ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt necessarily have the funds for the HAZMAT team,‚Äù saying that it has for years been ‚Äútaking from the airport‚Äù by not paying rent for a hangar where its equipment is stored. The team, which has three trucks and a trailer, is being evicted from the hangar due to rules requiring it be used for aviation equipment.

Lahring didn‚Äôt like the suggestion the equipment be stored at the wastewater site for less than $500 per month because he said that space could fetch a lot more money from a private user.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not suggesting that you‚Äôre providing an inadequate service,‚Äù Lahring told Gutierrez.  
  
Commissioner Doug Brown said he thought the cost in terms of liability to the county could be far greater than what it pays for a HAZMAT team.  
  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm really nervous about going forward with this,‚Äù said Brown, a Republican from Laketon Township.  
  
Board Chair Bob Scolnik, a Norton Shores Republican, expressed frustration with the amount of time spent on a service as important as the HAZMAT team over an amount that comprises ‚Äú48/100,000ths‚Äù of the budget.  
  
‚ÄúSometimes it‚Äôs really bothersome how we get bogged down in these issues that are so small,‚Äù Scolnik said. ‚ÄúOne of the functions of government is to do things for citizens that they can‚Äôt do for themselves, and this is one of those things. It‚Äôs cheap. It‚Äôs a bargain.‚Äù",t2_16j0ds,daytripper96,0,1637262103.0,0,t1_hl5lg1x,hl5lg1x,False,daytripper96,t3_qwtb4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muskegon/comments/qwtb4j/two_muskegon_county_commissioners_tried_to/,"Two Muskegon County commissioners tried to dismantle and liquidate HAZMAT team, claimed it wasn‚Äôt the county‚Äôs business to ‚Äúsave lives""",/r/Muskegon/comments/qwtb4j/two_muskegon_county_commissioners_tried_to/hl5lg1x/,11,r/Muskegon,1,11

"I feel that it wouldn't be as bad as you think, coming from a former student of the MCC downtown campus. During peak times at the college, you would have at most 1 block worth of on street parking filled, however that was rarely the case. In regards to summer parking, there is already an excess of parking in downtown, disregarding the fact that there is a fraction of the classes offered during the summer. Overall, I would see this as a win as much of the infrastructure is already in place to accommodate an expansion. There are many options to entice college students, including local dining option (which would support local businesses and keep money local unlike the fast food restaurants lining apple ave near the current campus), transit, parks for recreation or studying, and provide the students a chance to enjoy a walkable area.

"I don't know anyone who calls it Mercy Health Arena, and as resistant to change as people are in Muskegon it'l probably stay that way. I wonder if they would have complained even more if they had tore the arena down as they had been contemplating before the Risers and Ironmen helped breath life back into it.


The city were in a tough place. They faced backlash on two fronts - people not wanting the name change at all, and people not wanting a religious organization's name on a public building. They also faced the fact that they were working at a disadvantaged - the vast majority of arenas today have corporate sponsorship. In a market where breaking even on an arena at all is a tough task, not having sold naming rights is a huge financial handicap.


They made a decision which will help keep the arena sustainable in the long term without taxing anyone. They've also put ""honoring LC Walker"" on the sign and are adding a restaurant with his name on it. 


I'm not a fan of trinity health, but there's no doubt this was in the best interest of the city. The arena is more than a hockey rink now, it has turned into a gathering place. Indoor soccer, indoor football, even disk golf on occasional sundays in the winter. Between that, the convention center, and multiple restaurants embedded into the arena it is more accessible to the public in many more ways than it used to be. Its important to maintain that as downtown continues its rebirth and funds from the naming rights will help ensure that.",t2_hu626d,Riseandgrindmkg,0,1633190117.0,0,t1_hf3zaqz,hf3zaqz,True,GPFlag_Guy1,t3_pzcxhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muskegon/comments/pzcxhv/thoughts_on_the_mercy_health_arena_name/,Thoughts on the Mercy Health Arena name?,/r/Muskegon/comments/pzcxhv/thoughts_on_the_mercy_health_arena_name/hf3zaqz/,1,r/Muskegon,0,1

I actually still do subconsciously call it the LC. It's what I have heard for basically a long time and the new name is barely 2 years old.

"Yeah, Muskegon folks have a difficult time accepting change and sometimes I think that's ok. We've lost a lot of good buildings that could have been renovated and it kind of caused a lot of distrust in change and forward movement, understandably so.

Our wide demographic includes elderly people that have been here since the Shaw Walker days and it's hard for them to see memories erased.

The boat formerly known as The Port City Princess was recently purchased by Sand Products Corporation to keep the historic cruise ship in Muskegon. It was renamed and given a little face-lift to start off. Now known as the ‚ÄúAquastar‚Äù, she stands out with a rich blue color scheme inspired by the SS AQUARAMA, the largest passenger ferry ever on the Great Lakes. The Aquastar continues to cruise Muskegon Lake and Lake Michigan allowing her passengers to enjoy getting out on our special lakes.  
The on board bar serving both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages only accepts credit/debit cards. There are also light snacks such as hot dogs and chips available. Each cruise is roughly 1 hour and 45 minutes. Cruise times may vary based on the schedule for the day and other factors, check the schedule on our booking page for the most updated information.  
The Aquastar will sail rain or shine. No refunds due to missed departure times or inclement weather.

"Let's break it down by what you're hungry for!  
Pizza:  
Capone's Speakeasy is pretty legit Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.  
Bernie-O's does some pretty creative pizzas.  
Rebel Pies also does some inventive pizzas, and they share the space with Unruly Brewing  
Fricano's has super thin, super greasy pizza. It's a love it or hate it sort of pizza.  
Muskegonites worship at the shrine of Scrib's Pizza. For my money I'd rather go to Top Shelf...  
Asian:  
Kazumi's Steakhouse is a showy hibachi-style experience, but it's good.  
Yum Yum Sushi, Kazumi's, and (Surprisingly) the Red Wok buffet all have pretty good sushi.  
Mexican/Tacos:  
There's a ton of well-liked taco trucks around town.   
Rad Dad's is tasty, not-at-all-authentic fusion sorts of tacos.  
The food menus worth eating off of at bars breweries or distilleries:  
794 Grill has a menu that is varied, but manageable.   
Pints and Quarts feels kinda like a sports bar except there's no sports d√©cor, great apps  
The Deck is an outside place on the beach, so summer only, but good.  
18th Amendment Distillery has wood fired pizzas, an interesting menu, and great cocktails.  
Burl & Sprig has delicious food, but it's more like snacks to go with your (amazing) cocktails.

Sandwiches:  
Fatty Lumpkins is a nice little sandwich shop  
Hamburger Mikey is like Five Guys burgers and Fries, only better  
US31 Bar-B-Q is unlike any other barbecue sandwich. Delicious sauce and a signature relish.

Coffee:  
The Coffee Factory and Drip, Drop, Drink are both decent coffee shops, but I haven't visited them much.  
Aldea Coffee is a coffee shop with a mission to improve the lives of the coffee farmers they work directly with. (And really good coffee and atmosphere too)

Miscellaneous:  
Nipote's Italian Kitchen has excellent food and some lighter choices then you'd expect  
Curry Kitchen and Naan Pizza is really good Indian food",t2_7do6i,Crazjtk,0,1629858561.0,0,t1_ha8st9u,ha8st9u,True,ohleever,t3_pap3ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muskegon/comments/pap3ic/best_food_in_muskegon/,Best food in muskegon,/r/Muskegon/comments/pap3ic/best_food_in_muskegon/ha8st9u/,4,r/Muskegon,0,4
"Downtown on Western the new Occidental Eats has some good dogs and ice cream, and Rolling Stone Pizza in the chalets near the Farmers Market is awesome. Burl and Sprig is nice. Capone's Speakeasy for pizza and Only Canoli for baked goods. DT also has Curry Kitchen.

Lakeside has the Pierogi Shack and Lake Dog Coney Island. Both are incredible.

A LOT of taco trucks on Laketon, but near Laketon/Getty is Kayla's Tacos which is awesome. Navarro's in the Heights for tamales.

Yum Yum Sushi is the best Asian in town. Easily. And it's real good, like big city good on some dishes.

Soul-Filled Eatery on Glade (near the Hearthstone) is take out only and looks like a house, not a restaurant. Incredible soul food, the best Nashville Hot chicken.

A few more hidden gems - Savage Hog BBQ I'm Fruitport, Fatty Lumpkins near downtown for sandwiches, Hamburger Mikey, too. Oh, the Pita Place near Apple/Quarterline.

"Steak N Egger on Holton has amazing breakfast food and a lot of it for cheap.

"Sorry i am so late, but I grew up in Metro Detroit and now I've lived in Muskegon for two years now.   
Downtown Muskegon is nice, and it is up and coming. Lots of condos being built. Almost every weekend there are things happening downtown in the summer. They have some decent bars but like I feel like Muskegon only has 3 types of food, Tacos, Pizza or BBQ.   
If you like really good ethic food that you have in the Detroit area, you just won't find it here. Seriously good Arabic food is impossible. You have to drive 20 minutes to Grand Haven or go into GR for the good shit.   
As for walkable things, its not really in Muskegon, while downtown has a few nice things they are pretty limited. Also downtown isn't near the lake, if you live near the lake, you have to drive to restaurants and stores.  
Also living out here isn't the same in the Metro Detroit Area, its like 50 minute to get to GR, but its like 50 minutes of farms. Not like going to Ann Arbor from Detroit and having things in-between.  
Another person mentioned about doctors and I 100% agree, I drive to GR for my doctors appointments. Great dentist here in the city.

"Here's a few pins of locations with access to Muskegon River.  Most I believe are free to launch canoe/kayak except the furthest two upstream I believe they charge to park and launch.  The further upstream locations get pretty busy with tubers floating the river. Downstream spots are quieter IMO.

I usually float these downstream so you end up having to stage a vehicle, not sure if you would be able to get back upstream if you just had one vehicle.
