Colorado's Marijuana Sale and Distribution Laws

Although Colorado marijuana laws permit adults to possess a certain amount of marijuana, the sale, delivery, or distribution of marijuana is a crime in Colorado. Colorado imposes a range of penalties, according to the amount and the people involved.

Giving no more than two ounces without payment. A person who gives no more than two ounces to another person, without payment, commits a petty drug offense. Treated as mere possession, the potential penalty is a $100 fine. (Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-18-406(5)(c) (2019).)

Selling no more than four ounces of marijuana, or no more than two ounces of marijuana concentrate. The offense is a level one drug misdemeanor, punishable by between six and 18 months in jail, a fine of between $500 and $5,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-501, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(E) (2019).)

Selling more than four ounces but no more than 12 ounces of marijuana, or more than two ounces but no more than six ounces of concentrate. The offense is a level four drug felony, punishable by between six months and one year in jail, a fine of between $1,000 and $100,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(D) (2019).)

Selling more than 12 ounces but no more than five pounds of marijuana, or more than six ounces but no more than two and one-half pounds of concentrate. The offense is a level three drug felony, punishable by between two and four years in prison, a fine of between $2,000 and $500,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(C) (2019).)

Selling more than five pounds but no more than 50 pounds of marijuana, or more than two and one-half pounds but no more than 25 pounds of concentrate. The offense is a level two drug felony, punishable by between four and eight years in prison, a fine of between $3,000 and $750,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(B) (2019).)

Selling more than 50 pounds of marijuana or more than 25 pounds of concentrate. The offense is a level one drug felony, punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of at least eight years (and as many as 32 years) in prison. The court may impose a fine in addition to imprisonment. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(A) (2019).)

Selling, transferring, or dispensing marijuana to a minor. Colorado law prescribes harsher penalties for adults who sell, transfer, or dispense marijuana to a minor who is at least two years younger than the seller. The penalties vary depending on the amount of marijuana or marijuana concentrate sold, as follows:

    If the transfer involves no more than one ounce of marijuana or no more than one-half ounce of concentrate, the offense is a level four drug felony. A conviction can result in between six months and one year in jail, a fine of between $1,000 and $100,000, or both.
    If the transfer involves more than one ounce but no more than six ounces of marijuana, or more than one-half ounce but no more than three ounces of concentrate, the offense is a level three drug felony. A conviction can result in between two and four years in prison, a fine of between $2,000 and $500,000, or both.
    If the transfer involves more than six ounces but no more than two and one-half pounds of marijuana, or more than three ounces but no more than one pound of concentrate, the offense is a level two drug felony. A conviction can result in between four and eight years in prison, a fine of between $3,000 and $750,000, or both.
    If the transfer involves more than two and one-half pounds of marijuana, or more than one pound of concentrate, the offense is a level one drug felony. A conviction will result in a mandatory minimum sentence of at least eight years (and as many as 32 years) in prison. The court may impose a fine in addition to imprisonment.

"I disagree with this advice. 99.9% of the snowshoeing that people do around here is on trails, groomed, packed or otherwise. It’s a little bit better with a few inches of snow, but you’re using snowshoes more for traction than floatation. Bushwhacking around in deep snow, unless your snowshoes are the 5 foot long Grizzly Adams variety, is going to be exhausting, painful and you could end up getting lost. 

My advice would be to rent snowshoes and go to any of the popular trailheads around here and stay on established trails. The place where you rent them will have good advice based on your experience, fitness level etc.",t2_pf7tt,pogiepika,0,1648118424.0,0,t1_i1wxexg,i1wxexg,False,zeekaran,t3_tlaux0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breckenridge/comments/tlaux0/questions_about_snowshoeing_never_done_before/,"Questions about snowshoeing, never done before",/r/Breckenridge/comments/tlaux0/questions_about_snowshoeing_never_done_before/i1wxexg/,2,r/Breckenridge,0,2
"Answering out of order:
(4) Snowshoeing is best in deep powder after a fresh snow. The Nordic center has groomed trails. Do not snow show on packed out or groomed trails. You won't have any fun. 

(1) Only the weather between now and April will tell if April will be any good.

(2) plenty of free hiking trails in breck. Stay off them with snow shoes if they're packed out. You won't have any fun.

(3) you'll have plenty of fun on your own. 

(5) No the the avalanche, yes but not really to the getting lost. 


Pick a trail to stay near but not on. My best recommendation for you would be start at the Boreas pass trail head. Hike (without the snow shoes on) for the first mile along where the trail overlooks the town below. When the trail begins to curve to the left instead of following the trail strap on those shoes and head into the trees where the fun deep snow is. The views are great, you'll be able to stay close to boreas but snow shoe within that valley area. Bring lots of water and have fun. 

This is what I did with my mom when she came out and wanted to try snowshoeing during a shit season with little snow. It's been a shit season with little snow this year",t2_3dhjdseh,ivantmybord,0,1648080949.0,0,t1_i1v9uht,i1v9uht,True,zeekaran,t3_tlaux0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Breckenridge/comments/tlaux0/questions_about_snowshoeing_never_done_before/,"Questions about snowshoeing, never done before",/r/Breckenridge/comments/tlaux0/questions_about_snowshoeing_never_done_before/i1v9uht/,1,r/Breckenridge,0,1

"I've said it before and I'll say it again, cap the STRs for now, sure. But in the long run make it so that you must be a full time resident of summit to buy a place or summit. Cap the number of homes a local can purchase to prevent monopoly. Watch the housing value plummet. If an owner of one of these houses wants to rent STR at least the money stays in the county instead of going to rental company based in Duluth and the home owner based in Dallas. 

Or better yet strictly and acutely zone the town so that there's commercial and residential. Why should you be able to operate a hotel out of your house? I can't operate a bar in my garage.

"Unfortunately you have to go through Vail Resorts. I tried giving Craigslist lessons back in 2010 - I immediately received a cease and desist email, and two phone calls from Vail Resorts.

Vail pays to use the land, and so they also take on the liability. Rogue lessons are a liability, and so it is in their right to crackdown on them. This is different than coaching though! Not sure how ski and snowboard teams operate in regards to VR. 

I've also heard of families that find a private instructor they like then booking with them for the full week... unsure if it is booked through VR or just a phone call to the instructor and some cash exchanged.

"Probably going to get some hate for this. But I'm a Texan who has family that has lived and worked in Breckenridge for over 40+ years. I won't mention my family's name and their downtown business but I've been coming to Breckenridge since the late 80's to visit not only my family, but of course to ski/board and enjoy the beauty that is in Summit County.

I've watched Breckenridge grow since I've come here and with it comes growing pains, price increase, COL increase, housing shortages, crappy tourists, and all that....

My own family leaves Breckenridge on the weekends (works the work week) just to escape the amount of people.

It makes me sad, but also understandable. I too live in a city that has changed drastically in the last decade plus and makes it unbearable at times to see the changes and deal with all the people. (A city in Texas that rhymes with Boston.)

Anyway-- as someone whose worked in the service industry, married to a blue collar man, and still works in customer service... I can imagine the kind of mess many of y'all endure with tourists on spring break.

I'm sorry. I am. I hope things get better-- and hope the tips are bigger. And the time flies for y'all when dealing with difficult folks.

Personally we always tip well, do our part to clean up after ourselves, watch our kids, teach them mountain etiquette, teach them to say ""please and thank you"", teach them patience, and to leave people and places in better condition than you found them. 

We love Breckenridge and Summit County... and it will always hold a special place in our heart. So it saddens me when I see how difficult it's become for locals and the service industry.

"Except it's not just a tourist town. It's not DisneyWorld. It's a real town with over 150 years of history. Real people live there, work there, raise families there. They have real life day to day things to accomplish. They aren't there to be a servant for some tourist family. Just because someone is on vacation doesn't give them the right to be disrespectful, rude, ungrateful. It has to be a mutually beneficial arrangement. The amount of selfish behavior by tourist has become off the scale. It's literally driving the ""Local"" away. Illegally parking and making a ""local"" late for work or worse is BS. Not following acceptable social norms regarding kids and families is BS. I don't know what it is about going on vacation that makes people become assholes, but it sucks and shouldn't be tolerated. 

  I lived there for close to 40 years and just couldn't do it anymore. I met tons of fantastic tourist. Even lifelong friends with some. But the big percentage of just oblivious tourists is just ridiculous. Breck once was a great place to work, live and play..now it's just a hassle to even go shopping, find a place to park for work.

"Awesome info here \^\^.  Was at Breck a couple wks ago and did exactly this on my last day- was dropped off at peak 9 / beaver run parking at 9am, had to be back by noon, wanted to get in a couple laps on peak 6.  Was able to get over there, get in 4 or 5 no-hike runs on peak 6, a couple on peak 7, and make it back to peak 9 parking by 11:45.  This was mid-week with minimal lines though.  If you're going on a weekend you could still do it but probably not with as many laps.

The line for quicksilver is usually pretty ugly in the morning so I just walked up to beaver run chair and zipped down columbia to get to the peak 8 superconnect.

From there, columbine >> pioneer >> peak 6 pkwy is definitely the way to go because you can get directly to zendo pretty easily if you're paying attention.  If you're flying it is easy to miss but just keep going left whenever you see a trail to turn onto

Agreed on the annoyance of getting back due to having to get into the shitshow at the peak 8 base.  That can be a bit of a wildcard as far as time goes but if you're using the singles line it's usually not too bad.

"To help you out on #2, I get to peak 6 all the time from parking at 9. You can do plenty more than 1 run at 6 and make it back in 2.5 hours. Take quicksilver up, come down and hop on peak 8 superconnect lift. Take columbine from there to peak 7. I usually go down pioneer and take the independence super chair back up. Then angel’s rest over to Zendo chair and then up Kensho. Longest wait you are going to have is at independence which can get backed up. You could try to skip it and take peak 6 parkway direct from pioneer but I’ve never been able to catch it in the moment. Plus I like pioneer. I’ve never seen Peak 6 crowded btw. Getting back is a little more annoying since you have to go up at Peak 8, but you can get back in about 30-40 min depending on the peak 8 wait.

Colorado's Marijuana Sale and Distribution Laws

Although Colorado marijuana laws permit adults to possess a certain amount of marijuana, the sale, delivery, or distribution of marijuana is a crime in Colorado. Colorado imposes a range of penalties, according to the amount and the people involved.

Giving no more than two ounces without payment. A person who gives no more than two ounces to another person, without payment, commits a petty drug offense. Treated as mere possession, the potential penalty is a $100 fine. (Colo. Rev. Stat. § 18-18-406(5)(c) (2019).)

Selling no more than four ounces of marijuana, or no more than two ounces of marijuana concentrate. The offense is a level one drug misdemeanor, punishable by between six and 18 months in jail, a fine of between $500 and $5,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-501, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(E) (2019).)

Selling more than four ounces but no more than 12 ounces of marijuana, or more than two ounces but no more than six ounces of concentrate. The offense is a level four drug felony, punishable by between six months and one year in jail, a fine of between $1,000 and $100,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(D) (2019).)

Selling more than 12 ounces but no more than five pounds of marijuana, or more than six ounces but no more than two and one-half pounds of concentrate. The offense is a level three drug felony, punishable by between two and four years in prison, a fine of between $2,000 and $500,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(C) (2019).)

Selling more than five pounds but no more than 50 pounds of marijuana, or more than two and one-half pounds but no more than 25 pounds of concentrate. The offense is a level two drug felony, punishable by between four and eight years in prison, a fine of between $3,000 and $750,000, or both. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(B) (2019).)

Selling more than 50 pounds of marijuana or more than 25 pounds of concentrate. The offense is a level one drug felony, punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of at least eight years (and as many as 32 years) in prison. The court may impose a fine in addition to imprisonment. (Colo. Rev. Stat. §§ 18-1.3-401.5, 18-18-406(2)(b)(III)(A) (2019).)

Selling, transferring, or dispensing marijuana to a minor. Colorado law prescribes harsher penalties for adults who sell, transfer, or dispense marijuana to a minor who is at least two years younger than the seller. The penalties vary depending on the amount of marijuana or marijuana concentrate sold, as follows:

    If the transfer involves no more than one ounce of marijuana or no more than one-half ounce of concentrate, the offense is a level four drug felony. A conviction can result in between six months and one year in jail, a fine of between $1,000 and $100,000, or both.
    If the transfer involves more than one ounce but no more than six ounces of marijuana, or more than one-half ounce but no more than three ounces of concentrate, the offense is a level three drug felony. A conviction can result in between two and four years in prison, a fine of between $2,000 and $500,000, or both.
    If the transfer involves more than six ounces but no more than two and one-half pounds of marijuana, or more than three ounces but no more than one pound of concentrate, the offense is a level two drug felony. A conviction can result in between four and eight years in prison, a fine of between $3,000 and $750,000, or both.
    If the transfer involves more than two and one-half pounds of marijuana, or more than one pound of concentrate, the offense is a level one drug felony. A conviction will result in a mandatory minimum sentence of at least eight years (and as many as 32 years) in prison. The court may impose a fine in addition to imprisonment.

"Making it work here is doable but just not like other places. Being reliable and professional will set you apart from the rest of the work force and let you climb the ranks at any job pretty quickly. 

Finding housing is the worst and if you have a pet it's unfortunately even harder. Summit is really unfriendly when it comes to dogs.

Making friends is kinda trial and error, it's very easy to meet people. Meeting quality people was a little more work. But this county is filled with great people and mentors. Also lots of fun events and happenings off the beaten path you'll have to seek yourself.

"Bartending is kinda the top of the job pile in Breck. At least in the service industry. Some places have had the same bartenders for literally 20 years. Women have an advantage at finding jobs in restaurants. It's good that you're willing to work your way up. Management will like that attitude. Breck is one of the friendliest places I've ever been or lived. meeting people is as easy as sitting down at the bar and starting a conversation. You'll find yourself going out with co-workers after shifts. Also be involved, like softball, soccer..hockey or whatever. Go skiing with a coworker.

 I'd try to save up first, last and deposit plus if possible. Be prepared to have roommates. Be prepared to commute from Blue river or wherever outside of town.

"Hi, 

Live here for two years now. There's a lot of demand for good service workers (Baristas, bartenders, servers, etc...) Nearly everybody is hiring because we've been so short during the summer. Definitely would have to find a room with someone but there's always a rotating amount of houses and rooms. Checking Craigslist, summit county housing connections (Facebook), and One Mans Junk (Facebook). I'd say that rents are at minimum around $750 - $800 and up. In terms of making friends it's a lot easier now than it was during the pandemic. RMU does a weekly skin-up the resort on Thursday night and Thursday night bike rides during the summer. Lots of trivia, the rec center has leagues you can join, fitness classes, yoga, workout courses etc...so just being out and around town and involved you'll be good. Your budget is definitely within range, but stick around a few years and things are slowly getting better.

"Recreation center: Awesome swimming pools and basketball courts + much more. If you want to stay active its the place to be

Just walk down main street: Breck has many original stores with clothing, candies, spices etc. (sorry just saw you said other than this but it really is nice, especially at night)

Take the gondola around, instead of getting off to ski, just enjoy the views.

If you can’t get enough of skiing, head over to Keystone (45 minute drive) and go night skiing!

Awesome restaurants to try; Twist, Relish, Briar Rose, Aurum, Kenosha, Breck Tap house, Downstairs at Erics, Heathstone.

Check out the nordic center, they offer many activities (indoor and outdoor) such as cross country, snow shoeing, etc. 

Or just take the day off! You’ll be tired after 2 days of skiing 😂

"For the record, I'm at Breck right now. Peak 6 is very accessible, but it's really just a good starter's bowl.  The blues off the right facing the downward side are fine, but currently, they are so thin as to restrict skiing to a small portion.  Intuition, to the other side, is a tad bit thin, but was mostly good snow but with no real bite. It's fun, but it's not challenging if you are experienced. It is more challenging than bliss and the other runs.  These are all good for giving you a taste of what bowl skiing can be like, at least when there is more snow and you have more choice of lines.  BTW, while getting thin, the best snow this week was off of Whale's tail and some of the runs off the t-bar (Horseshoe bowl, in particular).   They all had good snow, but you were somewhat restricted by rocks at some point in the run.  I'm not a hiker so I did not try the rest.

"Shouts out fellow Seattleite, born and raised in Seatown myself. Live in Keystone now.

\-Buses are all free always, it's not difficult to bus from Silverthorne to Keystone resort, that's one bus; busing from Silverthorne to Breck will require you to get off at the Frisco transfer station and catch a different bus to Breck, same goes for the return trip, get off at the transfer station catch a separate bus back to Silverthorne. There's a Whole Foods and a really cool Brewery called Outer Range right next to the Frisco transfer station so that's super convenient.

\-No advice on busses really, the Breck bus will let off at the Breck transfer station get off, and catch the gondola up to the lifts. The Keystone bus drops you off right in front of the river run vilage walk through the village to the gondola.

\-Depending on where you are staying in Silverthorne, there's hiking all around, it will be snowy winter hiking but still doable, pull up All Trails and check out a trail that's nearby, Ptarmigan hill, Tenderfoot mtn, Mesa Cortina trail are all pretty close; the big lake is frozen and there's a groomed walking trail that goes out on the frozen lake, gorgeous views of the surrounding mountains and you're walking way out on a frozen lake.

"Overall it's worked well for us, being in Golden. The parking situation at pretty much all the major CO resorts is a nightmare, so spending $750 per year on the HOA fees is worth it. You do have to login to the BGV website the week before, right about 7am to make sure you get a parking spot reserved. For example, if I want to reserve a spot on Sat, March 5th, I need to be logged in and reserving a spot between 7-8am on Sat, Feb 26th. They do have a waitlist if you aren't quick, and some weekends fill up faster than others.  


But it's worth it, for these reasons:

1. Heated garage to park in
2. Locker rooms to change in/out of ski boots
3. Ski in / ski out (not the easiest, but pretty close)
4. Using the facilities after skiing. We'll stop around 2-3pm and go change out of our ski gear and into swim suits and go soak for an hour or so while traffic dies down. 
5. The onsite restaurant (The Boot) is not bad at all. You can bring cocktails from the bar to the pool / hot tubs in a plastic cup
6. The shuttle to/from town is a great deal too. Leave your car in the garage and go have dinner in town
7. We have used ""Bonus Time"" occasionally, it's a great deal. 

For the most part, there aren't many downsides if you can use it 10+ times a year, I would think a lot of folks would pay $70 per day with those kind of amenities. It just takes a lot of the hassles out of day skiing, IMO.   


My recommendation is get a summer week, not a spring/fall. You can get the offseason weeks on ebay or through craigslist practically free (closing costs) but we've actually traded our week for some decent stays elsewhere.

"In my opinion. Stay away from timeshares. If you want to use them for a free stay, that's one thing. But never buy. You're locked into a contract stretching eternity where they will charge maintenance fees, transfer fees, raised fees, and  block you from renting to other non-owners. All while they let the property go without remodeling and maintaining over time. Once they sell out the units, They don't care to upkeep the property and provide service the same way. You, as an owner, don't actually own anything. Real estate should appreciate your asset will depreciate. Just do a quick Google search, and you will see how many companies specialize in getting people out of these timeshare contracts. These properties will not even take your timeshare back for free. They have no incentive. You're already on the hook for a lifetime of fees. You can buy most timeshares from other people for just $1 or less. Because these people are desperate to get out of the contract. I don't know about this particular timeshare you're looking at.

"I own at Peak 7 and Peak 8. Most of the sales guys are easy going, and they can tell quickly if you are interested or not.

If you don’t live within a 3-5 hour drive of Breck, the advantages to buying with the developer start to evaporate. Resale is always an option.

Renting is the easy part. You can go through them for a STEEP but worry free commission, or rent it on VRBO yourself and deal with the hassle for more of the proceeds. I once rented a one bedroom master over Valentines Day week for over $4k gross.

Reserving your week can be a pain if you want a high demand week. Every season they sell has a sweet spot that everyone wants, so you have to be on the ball and call the moment the office opens to reserve your week each year.

That being said, the properties are fantastic. My son has been going for years, and he used to openly weep when we checked out. The day use is crazy convenient, so we can have ski in/out parking even when we aren’t staying there. During covid lockdowns, the BGV properties were one of the few that kept amenities open like pools and hot tubs with reservations.

Exchanging is easy, and so far we have done exchanges in Beaver Creek, Vail, Park City, and Florida.

Whether it is worth the price is a personal decision.

"u/hedgemonyhog I know exactly where you are talking about. Is it walkable? Yeah, it is, but it would be a nightmare if it snows at some point in the day, and you have to drag all that over snow.

Your best bet is to take the bus (yellow route) at the breckenridge station (Gondola) to stop #65 (slightly above where your condo is in four o clock) then walk across the street to your condo. BOOM.

The route runs until 11:15 so you should have plenty of time!

"Just was in breck two weeks ago. I have now skid 11 days total in my 30 years of existence. Imperial bowl was very ease and very fun. Yes a little daunting due to the height and magnitude of the mountain but there are some clean routes down. If you want to really be challenged check the route on the backside, George’s thumb, the ski across the ridge to the drop ins was pretty epic. 

Peak 6 was very fun as well but extremely crowded especially going down bliss. 

All in all breck was amazing. No bad areas just the center peaks get a lot of traffic.

"I work at an Eastern VR mountain. I'm ski school, not lift ops. But that said, I've never seen the guys scanning passes do much more than confirm somebody's name from time to time, and that's usually just to make sure they scanned your pass and not the person behind you or something.

As long as your GF fits the general description of the person who's pass she's holding, and remembers to respond to that person's name, you're not going to have a problem.  Especially wearing goggles and a mask.  These guys aren't Sherlock Holmes who are going to sniff you out due to a wisp of hair sticking out or something.  They have to move thousands of people through the lift lines and don't have much time to do anything beyond cursory inspection.  Even when the lines are short to non-existent ... as long as your pass goes ""beep"" they hardly give it a second thought.

As for those of you taking a moral high-ground and saying ""theft of service"" and all that ... get real.  For decades people have sold their unused passes and such before it all went electronic.  Heck it used to be pretty common for people to ski in the morning, and sell their ticket in the parking lot to someone arriving later.

"Don't think you'll be running on trails, you'll most likely just be snow shoeing unless we see no snow and warm weather to ice over the trails. If you are looking to run you may have to stick to the streets. You will not get up quandary without snow shoeing regardless of conditions during this time of the year. You can trail run the bike paths around since they are groomed for x-skiing but other than that I'm unsure if you'll find any actual trails to run. It's possible there may be trails of tiger Rd that would be clear enough to trail run as it's a south facing slope, but again just depends on weather before you come up.

"I’ve let friends use my wife’s (Caucasian) pass for a few years. Always made sure they knew all the info. However recently we were lazy and my friend didn’t memorize my wife’s pass info. My friend (who’s mixed) put on her blacked out goggles and mask getting on the gondola which in hind sight was pretty obvious. She got asked for her bday but didn’t know the info nor her address and ended up getting pulled to the side. She was told they were taking my wife’s pass and that she’d be emailed instructions on how to get it back. I asked what those instructions were and the worker was intentionally vague and said she didn’t know the instructions (yeah right). Well turns out my wife’s season pass is confiscated for the rest of the season! Sooooo, that’s the penalty.

"Keep in mind that ALL of the bowls are ungroomed, so any part of the terrain could get at least a little bumpy and most of it is VERY bumpy. Horseshoe is NOT what you're looking for.  It is bumped out and steep. And the entry is usually wind-scoured and sketching off the top. I would recommend Pika, Ptarmigan and White Crown right off of the T-Bar. Not too steep, usually soft, and rarely bumped out too much.  If you can handle that, work your way toward Whale's Tail between 8 and 7. The snow is usually very soft and wide, wide open.

"There are a littany of questions like this asked on a weekly basis. Honestly doing a little search of the subreddit would have yielded multiple responses with similar nature. 

Breckenridge is not a cheap area to travel to. Lift tickets are expensive. Rental cars are expensive. Lodge rentals are expensive. Food and gas are more expensive here. You are probably allready aware of this.

&#x200B;

For one vehicle to transfer 7 people alone, $200 is not out of the ordinary. It would pretty much be considered a private transfer depending on what time you arrive. You could all book individually through PeakOne Express type shuttle options or take the mustang. These options are not always the most convenient, but they are the cheapest.
