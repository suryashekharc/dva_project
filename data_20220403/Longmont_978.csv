"As someone who lives in this neighborhood, I think that it is fine. Kensington is 3rd on the south, 9th for the northern border, and between Martin and Lashley. There is a park that runs north/south through the entire neighborhood with a basketball court, kids playground, and a lake to walk your dog around. You are still close enough to Main St to walk there for the restaurants. You need to drive to a grocery store though.

The thing about the neighborhood that some people won’t like is that (relatively) poor people live here. There is a large apartment complex at Martin and Long Peak Ave that is older and lower cost. The entire neighborhood is zoned Residential - Mixed Neighborhood, which allows for duplexes, as opposed to the neighborhood just to the west that is Residential - Single Family. This denser zoning has historically lead to more rentals and less capital investment in the real estate. There are free bus routes that pickup on Lashley and also on 3rd.

I’ve been researching Anytime Fitness recently and it seems they are one of the shittiest (as most gyms are) with cancellations and even charging after actual contracts end.

"Home info is public information. Including how much one pays and what one owes, house size, property size, how big the basement is. Also utility billing has no such detail. Credit card forms at least user facing do not expose full card info. One would have to infiltrate the system beyond userspace to find full card info. That’s one card which would be flagged as fraud and shut down.


Estimating appliances (based on usage I assume) is a crapshoot. Is that a Tesla charging or someone loves air conditioning? The usage stats don’t show time of day, just kWh. Even net worth would be hard. I had a coworker friend in the past that used so much power for work at home that they had to have their power on xcel reclassified as business. I looked into replacing gas heat with electric for example, even throwing away the fact right now it is less efficient. To do that I’d have to ask the city to give me business class power due to the amperage consumption. So in that scenario now I’m heating my home and megawatt-hour-ing. (Sadly, still gas.) Would be a boring property theft. Take my furnace, please.


I agree to be clear, we want better. I’m just saying the attack surface is annoying for homeowners but very low. Don’t get me wrong, I love where your head is at. Keep going. FIGHT ME. :-)

Agree it isn't good, and annoying mischief could be caused, and it should be fixed. It isn't like someone portjacking your phone number to harvest bitcoin though. It is a billing system that humans walk to houses to check meters and input charges into.

"It even varies quite a bit for just our household (2ppl). We have Comcast internet- roughly $125/month. And then Xcel energy is anywhere from $40-$80/month depending on the season. 

Water/sewer, trash, electric/gas are included in the rent but it bumps it up a little more than the “flat rate” they originally quote you. 

Then of course (like most of CO), you need renter’s insurance-Advenir will sell it to you for $12/month but it’s not very good coverage-and if you have pets…proof of vaccinations and pet rent of $35/pet.

Overall I feel like it’s pricey but not completely unreasonable compared to other places in town. Great location, nice and quiet. The apartments are nothing new or special but certainly live-able, and they have character.

"Planet fitness member here, so ill try to be unbiased. The north side one is ok, I'll give it a 7/10. Lots of socializing goes on in the evening, lots of telephones and texting between sets.

My biggest complaint is the parking lot-its sketch, lots of overnight campers, and the parking lot is dark. Dollar tree, cigarette store, big lots, arc thrift store are the neighbors. 

I recently started going to the Southside pf on ken Pratt. Mornings, not much of a crowd which is nice. Small lockers in middle left side, I am able to leave my phone in there and Bluetooth reaches the whole place. Cleaner, newer, nice showers, overall feels more open and spacious.

"I don't think I would define any part of Europe as socialist myself, in fact from my vantage point there are no socialist nations.  There are some socialist institutions/firms out there though.  I would mainly define it by the amount of democratization the business has.  Across nations it would mean that businesses no longer solely pursue a profit model, which becomes very, very complicated to think about since we've existed in this paradigm for so long.

I would actually recommend trying to read Das Kapital, it is incredibly boring, and I think it's filled with a lot of incorrect information (we've had over a hundred years of economic observation since)... but fundamentally it helps you realize we are still living in remnants of feudalism.  The person(s) who own the property you work at (if you work for someone else), are allowed to extract value your labor produces as profits (basically they tax you for working their stuff).

It's much easier to just ask, ""where does profit come from?"" though.

When it comes to freedom you have to question what power is, which will lead you towards reading anarchists (what hierarchies are justifiable? what isn't?).  For some reason in America freedom is only associated with property rights, and government restrictions.  No, one ever questions the freedom we deny or give to each other in other types of relationships; is the way a business' structure (hierarchy) ""freedom""?  Even when you have masters above you who can cut the strings?

Edit: I'm also not sure if socialism is possible without something like Star Trek's replication technology, or massive amounts of energy produced to brute force (automate) where labor is needed but not available because someone doesn't want to do it.  Morally, I think it is far superior just as open source software is superior to for profit software.

* The ambient benzene, while non-zero, is lower than most indoor measurements during summer and lower than urban sources (0.5 vs. 2-3). Oddly lower than where I measured in Longmont ... just makes me question the effects of ultra-local sources.
* The ozone is high but still under limits (60 vs. 100) and it's known Denver area has an ozone problem so moving to Longmont instead of Weld won't address that.
* The pm2.5 not great but -- again -- Denver is known for that problem and it'll get much worse in the summer. Not really avoidable. These days, if you want to avoid the pm2.5 and you refuse to move to the East Coast you basically have to live in Seattle. So again, a moot point.

"Thanks, this is great advice! It's good to confirm it's quiet most of the time -- except when it's being drilled.

I did notice that one site might have multiple wellbores, and each wellbore might have multiple ... I guess horizontal extensions. I imagine each one takes extra time to drill. The site I did in-depth research on was drilled or re-drilled 4 times in 32 years -- so I agree it might get touched once in my 10-year ownership of the home. If there are 4 wells ... Then maybe it would happen four times. 

That also means if I've got 3 wells next to me, it's 3x more likely I'll have a problem than if I've got only one.

"Thank you, I so appreciate the nuance in your reply. Really helps me make a judgment for myself honestly. Some things I note:

Good to know I am correct that it's weeks of loud / smelly /polluting activity surrounded by years of random trucks.

I will check wells near my home purchase for evidence of oil storage. For example, [in this photo](https://www.google.com/maps/place/825+Longs+Peak+Dr,+Erie,+CO+80516/@40.0405408,-105.0429313,94m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x876c0a09a955908d:0x6589258ebdb0e8c2!8m2!3d40.0414412!4d-105.0297839). That will help me understand what kind of traffic to expect.

I did run into one house that was surrounded by wells that were all spudded in 1985 and plugged (with a few exceptions) in 2018. I can into another house that was surrounded by wells spudded in the early 2000s and most were still producing or shut-in today with a few plugged. I will assume areas are ""developed"" around the same time. I expect the same area (a square mile or so) wouldn't likely be re-drilled again after everything there already been plugged.

I did see one case where several sites were colocated and some were plugged and others producing -- in this case, the plugged ones were from 1988 and the producing one from 2009. So I am also assuming a well has a ""lifetime"", and at a certain point the company needs to re-drill it into a new layer to keep its production up ... But eventually there's nowhere nearby left worth drilling and they plug it.

This seems like a case where there is a gray zone: it's not ""avoid living near all drilling"" but rather ""avoid living near producing or not-yet-producing areas since there's likely to be new drilling"". Obviously it's not pleasant to live next to those sounds / lights / smells, regardless of one's politics.",t2_l5tcwguj,throwawayre0322,0,1648848098.0,0,t1_i318s1l,i318s1l,False,throwawayre0322,t3_tss8up,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tss8up/fracking_in_longmont_vs_weld_county/,Fracking in Longmont vs. Weld County,/r/Longmont/comments/tss8up/fracking_in_longmont_vs_weld_county/i318s1l/,2,r/Longmont,0,2

The only difference being that in weld county you’re almost certainly going to get fined for a violation, whereas in Longmont/Boulder you’re more likely to have the police/neighbors work with you to resolve the issue instead.

In fact, towns like Firestone are seemingly more restrictive when it comes to “what you can do with your land” since the ordinances are almost identical & 99% of homes are in a HOA.  Drastic difference from Longmont where I can paint my house whatever color I want, etc.

Zoning, permits, etc are not rally that difficult.  If you can read you can get it done easily. But I suspect that would be a problem for people who went to schools out there.  So yeah I can see your point.

"Here's a few (somewhat random) thoughts of mine. Hopefully some are helpful. I spent a decade working in the oil and gas industry, all of it in the field visiting wellsites in various stages of completion and production, and about half of it in Colorado (the rest spread through Wyoming, Oklahoma, and Texas for the most part). I'm not pro-oil-and-gas, but I personally see it as a necessary evil until we can get most of our energy from renewable sources, which we (as a country/species) need to do faster than we are now, because there's a lot left to do. I say all that to support my claim that I've got a fairly neutral and educated stance on things. I left the industry on my own accord a few years ago to pursue things I found more interesting professionally.

First, rather than call it fracking, it's more accurate to just call it drilling. Fracking is one stage of the drilling and completing process, and it doesn't make sense to focus on that stage alone. Plus the word 'fracking' is like a dogwhistle for staunch supporters and opponents of oil-and-gas and then the actual productive conversation always gets drowned out by arguments. Every damn time...

A plugged and abandoned wellbore will not see life again. However I have seen recent wellbores in fairly close proximity to PA wells, but I don't know if they were drilled after the abandonment. So having a PA well does not guarantee there will be no other activity around, though it's not highly likely and probably has as much to do with politics and permitting than geology.

Activity around a wellsite is at its highest when the well is being drilled (or re-drilled, in the example you've got). A drill rig is a huge machine with a ton of supporting machinery around it. It's incredibly complex, expensive, and impressive from a technical perspective. After the drill rig finishes its job, a series of other processes take place (fracking being one of them) that can realistically just be lumped into the ""drilling"" stage of things for a layman, and thought of as the time when the big machinery is present. 

After a well is completed, there is a regular flow of traffic to the site. There are people (""pumpers"" or ""operators"" as they're called in the business) who will make regular (often daily) visits to the site to ensure things are working properly, make adjustments, and perform routine maintenance. Essentially it's a guy in a pickup truck who's got rights to be there. If you're lucky, the well will have pipes to carry away the oil and gas that are produced, but there will still be a tanker truck to carry out the water produced by the well. (Other parts of the country have pipes for water, but the formations around here usually don't produce enough water for that to make sense). If you're not as lucky, there will be a steady stream of trucks to offload oil from big tanks. As far as I know, these days you'll always have a pipe to carry out the gas in Weld county.

The general timeline you laid out- weeks at a time of huge activity, followed by years at a time of not a whole lot other than pumpers and tanker trucks- is pretty typical. There are always exceptions of course.

The pollution emitted during the drilling/fracking/completing processes is relatively high, and there will always be traffic contributing pollution outside these times, but I'd (as a non-expert) say that overall you're probably exposing yourself to fewer emissions than if you were to live on or near a busy highway.

Weld County has far more wells due to favorable politics in Weld vs Boulder County, not because of geology. There's plenty of oil and gas under Longmont, too. While I don't expect that to change any time soon, it's not impossible that Boulder (or Larimer) sees more activity in the future.

As to safety, a properly completed, well-maintained, and properly operating well is pretty safe. Catastrophic failures (explosions) are rare, but do happen, and have happened in Weld county in the recent past. The odds are low of something going wrong, but they'll never be zero. And not to kick off an internet argument, but I personally think people's fear of *fracking* is overblown and exaggerated. Anyone who actually understands the processes, the chemicals involved, and the distances we're talking about can tell you there are much bigger things (unrelated to oil and gas) to spend your time worrying about.

I'm not intending to explain the entire oil-and-gas industry, and so there are a few things here that I've glossed over or oversimplified. None of which is material to the concerns you've raised. I already fear I've drawn the ire of both the pro-oil-and-gas and anti-fracking factions, so don't be afraid to follow up with a direct message if you've got other questions I may be able to help with.",t2_dacewolh,theboozemaker,0,1648737908.0,0,t1_i2uq5xs,i2uq5xs,True,throwawayre0322,t3_tss8up,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tss8up/fracking_in_longmont_vs_weld_county/,Fracking in Longmont vs. Weld County,/r/Longmont/comments/tss8up/fracking_in_longmont_vs_weld_county/i2uq5xs/,31,r/Longmont,0,31
"Wells are supposedly safe once plugged and abandoned properly.  But… when was the last time you trusted one of the oil companies or the regulators that oversee them to ensure work is done properly?

It’s also not just existing wells, new wells can be permitted and installed.  There was a news article recently about one in Firestone (or Frederick) where they were trying to get permission to drill within the setback, I don’t know if they were able to get permission or not.

But I want to say. It’s not just fracking & oil.  Not by a long shot.   That’s part of it, but living in Longmont is far different.  

Back in the 90’s a bunch of developers bought farms and built homes on them in eastern weld county.  The infrastructure that existed for this massive influx of residents was essentially nonexistent.  The population that moved in is very right leaning & as a result hasn’t done a huge amount to make it a nice place to live because that costs money & taxes are bad.

I used to live in Firestone & I’ll outline some of my favorite things about Longmont.

- The people.  Mostly everyone here is truly kind and caring.  Sometimes communities in western weld county appear that way, but once you get to know people you’ll find trumpism and the hate that comes with it is rampant.  This is reflected in how the communities have developed, where our taxes are allocated, etc.

- Recreation. Contrary to the belief in western weld county “recreation” does not mean “building a single rec center and paving an old railroad track as ‘the trail’”.  In Longmont we have actual walking trails with shade, and we have lots of new ones too.  We have lots of connected parks with actual stuff in them (we have a ice skating rink in the winter).  But beyond that, we have access to good restaurants (and all the chains). Breweries that are walking distance to downtown food & shops.  It’s a 5-10 minute drive for me now.   When I lived in Firestone we drove 20-30 minutes into Longmont, Loveland, or Denver to find good food / things to do.  There’s basically nothing to do in western weld county.

- Driving.  I am 5-10 minutes from 99% of my destinations, and several restaurants are within walking distance.  If I drive downtown I park once & can walk to almost everything I’d want to see.  In western weld county you have to drive EVERYWHERE.  There is almost zero pedestrian connection, if you live across the street from a grocery store then you still have to drive.  I’ve also experienced far less aggressive driving in Longmont & surrounding areas, I feel safer here. 

- Schools, etc.  there are some fantastic schools in Longmont.  I can’t say the same for western weld county, especially at the high school level.

Simply, western weld county is, at its core, rural living.  It may look like suburbia but it’s not.

I also want to say that Erie is a step up, it’s somewhere between living in Longmont and living in Firestone IMO.",t2_2n8pnr83,rushlink1,0,1648737351.0,0,t1_i2uorws,i2uorws,True,throwawayre0322,t3_tss8up,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tss8up/fracking_in_longmont_vs_weld_county/,Fracking in Longmont vs. Weld County,/r/Longmont/comments/tss8up/fracking_in_longmont_vs_weld_county/i2uorws/,16,r/Longmont,0,16
"Weld resident checking in. 

Let me see if I can answer your questions first, then a couple comments.   Noisy and leaky while drilling?  Mostly true.  How polluting is a matter of much debate. Some people see methane emissions and wet themselves.  Other simply calculate the amount in cow-equivalents (same methane levels as 25 cows)


Once it's abandoned it's done?  Mostly true.  Technology keeps changing and sometimes it makes sense to re-drill a well with new technology.  But probably not in your home's lifetime.

Quiet most of the time?  True.  In production your major noise and annoyance is maintenance trucks going into the site.  And that's not often.

Same risk in Longmont?  That question is out of my paygrade. 

So what you are concerned with nowadays is well **sites** not wells.  Each of those big things usually has from 10-20 individual wells drilled laterally to different depths to hit different pockets.  That makes the drilling process long (months). On the other hand once in operation a fracked well doesn't really produce that fast, so they tend to just sit there and collect gas and oil for years. 

There are three of these sites within a kilometer of my house.  I can see one from my bedroom.  I will say that when they were drilling it, you could hear it with the windows open.  More annoying were the trucks going to and from the site kicking up dust 24/7.   Now that it's in production I hardly notice it.  I did call them once and complain and they repositioned some work lights that were shining in my window.

Longmont police have arrested a man accused of trying to strangle a woman and then barricading himself with a handgun.

Police were called at 9:17 p.m. Tuesday night to 1549 Northwestern Road for a report of several parties arguing outside of a residence related to a domestic assault.

Longmont Police first responded to a call of parties arguing outside of a residence at the 1500 block of Northwestern Road on Tuesday night related to a domestic assault. (Matthew Jonas/Staff Photographer)
A Longmont officer arrived at the home and spoke with two women who said they were assaulted. The women said the man, identified as Jesus Magallan, 58, was still in the residence and armed with a handgun.

The officer immediately moved the women to a safe location. Police made contact with Magallan, but he refused to come out.

He remained inside with police surrounding the address until he was taken into custody at 7:38 a.m. today.

The St. Vrain Valley School District announced on its website that the nearby Longmont Estates Elementary would not hold classes Wednesday due to the police operation.

PUBLISHED: September 2, 2021 

Sunshine poured through the mostly obliterated roof of “Ralph Castle’s place” Thursday. The light illuminated the inside of the former Longmont gas station, a treasure trove of leftover items hearkening back to a time when the family-owned operation was once a bustling hub.

Time may have taken its toll on the vacant building, but looking past the dust, one can picture a place where people filled up their gas tanks and swapped stories with the business owner, the late Ralph Castle.

Curious residents can now take a look for themselves at the relics that remain from the gas station’s days of operation. Pacific Auction & Realty owner OJ Pratt and cataloger Cass Miller are going through the items from the business, located at the corner of Main Street and Mountain View Avenue. The objects will be cataloged and put up for bid on an online auction that starts Friday and runs through Sept. 20. The collection will include stuff also cataloged from the Castle family home next door.

Combing the former service station and family home has been like uncovering a time capsule, Miller said.

“Just based on what I have gathered from a lot of people stopping by since I’ve been here,I think it represented freedom to a lot of people,” Miller said. “They got their car and they went down to Castle’s and got a soda. They had their charge account here. I think this place really represented the ability to travel and be free.”

Ralph Castle and his wife, Jean Castle, moved to Longmont from Denver in 1950 and that same year bought the gas station, which became known as “Ralph Castle’s place.” The service station operated for decades, closing in the mid-1990s, according to the couple’s son, Roger Castle. It was one of the last full-service stations to be operational in Longmont.

Ralph and Jean Castle had four children: Cary, Roger, Kristy and Kim. Ralph Castle died in 1998 at the age of 92. Jean Castle passed away in 2019.

“Ralph Castle’s place” is now for sale through Cushman and Wakefield, a Longmont real estate company. Roger Castle said the family believed that with the property up for sale, it made it the right time to also auction off the personal items inside.

Roger Castle said he has many fond memories of the business. From the ages of 12 to 23, he worked at his father’s gas station, helping to wash windshields and change tires.

Now a lawyer living in Denver, Roger Castle said there are many things that made the business stand out from the competition, including his dad’s connection with his customers.

“He had a new joke every week or two,” Roger Castle said. “He would tell every customer he dared.”

The gas station was privately owned and not controlled by an oil company.

“The rates my dad charged were the lowest in town for tire repair and lubrication, he never wanted to raise his prices,” Roger Castle said. “It was the cheapest place in town to get your car greased. He was very independent and did all the work himself.”

Remnants of Ralph Castle’s passion for his business, his Longmont community and singing with a barbershop chorus can be found within the items left behind.

Pratt has known the Castle family for decades, including singing with Ralph Castle in the Longmont Barbershoppers.

“(Jean and Ralph) were real involved in the community,” Pratt said. “I’m amazed at how many people know this spot, because it’s iconic just for the looks. It was really a hub of a lot of activity.”

Among the cataloged items is red-and-white-striped barbershop chorus pole that reads, SPEBSQUAD, a play on the acronym that stands for the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of Barbershop Quartet Singing in America. If people wanted tickets to see Ralph Castle and the chorus’ latest performance, his house next to the service station was the place to buy them, Pratt said.

Still inside the building is an old McCaskey register that still contains names of people and businesses with charge card accounts at the service station. A cigarette dispenser and candy machine still hang on the wall. Red, white and blue boxes of Atlas-brand and Tung-Sol-brand headlamps line the shelves, and many odds and ends crowd the business: boxes of children’s shoes and vintage clothing, giant dominoes and old atlases.

Pratt said collectors might take an interest in many of the old advertisements from the early ’40s and ’50s for oil, gas and insect spray with DDT that were gleaned from inside the former gas station

“These things are just incredibly rare,” Pratt said.

Miller added: “All of this was up in the attic, where there is no roof anymore. You would have expected there to be water damage or mold or something, but like I said, it’s like it was perfectly preserved somehow. A lot of these items, you would have destroyed after the selling season. To have them around is pretty cool.”

Ralph Castle’s history of operating gas stations goes back to the 1930s. When he bought the Longmont business in 1950, there was a Standard Oil sign towering above the business, but it was removed in 1989, because motorists kept crashing into the sign, according to the Times-Call archives.

The city in 2018 condemned the garage that was attached to the business building, and it was demolished.

The online auction can be found at Pacific Auction’s website at pacificauction.com. Proceeds will go to the Castle family. For more information, people can email info@pacificauction.com.

“It’s a landmark,” Miller said of the former gas station. “Everybody has been curious what’s in this place still. Now is your opportunity to see what’s still in the building. Even though this building has sat for as long as it has, you can still feel the energy of yesterday.”",t2_12za05ra,streamfresh,0,1648611042.0,0,t1_i2o72g4,i2o72g4,False,CudaCorner666,t3_tr6mei,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tr6mei/the_ralph_castle_sign_is_gone/,The Ralph Castle sign is gone,/r/Longmont/comments/tr6mei/the_ralph_castle_sign_is_gone/i2o72g4/,3,r/Longmont,0,3

"My $1400 rent is now increasing to $2000. You are going to be hard pressed to find anything below $1500 and that’s just for rent alone. Wifi, phones, gas, insurance, utilities so on and so forth. If you got a good job you’ll settle just fine, but if you’re not making more than $18/hour you will be uncomfortable. 

With a dual income household I’m sure this isn’t as daunting as it is for someone like me living single with a dog. But as of right now I had to take a huge L and move from my nice apartment to a raggedy shitty fukn room in some strangers house (9x6 ft not even kidding) for $695/month. It’s weighing pretty heavy on my conscience rn honestly especially after recovering from an eight year stint of drug abuse (3 years clean as of January 27 this year) everything I’ve worked for and all the progress I’ve made is dashed away due to an insane rent increase. 

Me of all people understands a home for you and yours is a sanctuary, but if you’re open to it check the surrounding areas. Boulder is a 20 minute commute and it’s always poppin because it’s a college town. You got Boulder, Lafayette, superior, Firestone, mead, Gunbarrel, niwot, lyons and a few others that are a reasonable distance to commute from. I’d check them out too. And if your pride isn’t too hard to swallow there are several people renting out entire basements. No private entry for damn near all and again I know it’s not ideal as a family but as someone said earlier you’ll learn to make something work. Don’t settle to heavy on the Longmont area alone. I’m sure there are other options as well in the surrounding areas. Find something that works for now and save up to get something that’s satisfactory while doing so. 

Check Craigslist, roomies and roommates.com

If you want an abode to yourself check Airbnb as a last resort for their long term stays.

It’s also worth mentioning that, atleast for iPhones, WEA version varies from carrier to carrier.  For example the first verizon iPhone to support WEA 2.0 is the 6, whereas with AT&T it’s the 5s.

WEA 2.0 offered improved message length & clickable links.

WEA 3.0 offers improved geotargetibg down to 1/10th of a mile. 

With WEA 3.0 the phone will still receive the alert, but it’ll just ignore it if you’re outside the area.

"Second that, have used them for plumbing, electrical, and HVAC both hot and cold side. Other friends have used them for sump pump issues. You don't have to sign any ""service contracts"" like the over-priced precision. On larger projects that require it, they pull all the permits (as required) and upgrade any equipment out of code (like intake/exhaust piping, outdated wiring) around the install to bring it up to current code. (Which I feel should be a given, but just pointing out because of the varying level of ""attention to detail"" and/or corner-cutting some places will do.) They also file warranty and rebate paperwork for you so you don't have to mess with all that.

"[Paywall]

In an effort to beautify Longmont’s parks in time for warm weather, the city is launching its annual “Clean Up, Green Up.”

The monthlong citywide campaign begins with a grand kick-off from 7:30 to 10 a.m. April 2 at the Sunset Campus, 7 S. Sunset St. From then through April 23, city staff are inviting businesses, civic groups, schools, neighborhoods and families to come together to clean up Longmont’s parks.

Lore Blattner, executive assistant for the city’s Public Works & Natural Resources department, encouraged community members to sign up for the event.

“I believe people like to support and give back to their community; this is a positive way to do that, and it’s fun!” Blattner wrote in an email.

Those who want to help but can’t participate in the kick-off event are still welcome to contribute. To sign up and to pick up trash and recycle bags, email Blattner at Lore.Blattner@longmontcolorado.gov or Taylor.Gifford@longmontcolorado.gov",t2_4qkpx,aydengryphon,0,1648222397.0,0,t1_i22rbma,i22rbma,True,aydengryphon,t3_tnoi36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tnoi36/longmont_kicks_off_monthlong_clean_up_green_up/,"Longmont kicks off monthlong Clean Up, Green Up event April 2",/r/Longmont/comments/tnoi36/longmont_kicks_off_monthlong_clean_up_green_up/i22rbma/,4,r/Longmont,0,4

"AT&T is currently shutting off 3G service across the country. If you have a phone that is not on AT&T's whitelist (https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/pdf/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf) that may be what is going on. Although you say you have wifi calling so it likely is on the whitelist. You could also have an old SIM card that isn't fully provisioned for the LTE/5G network and that is causing issues and you may just need a new SIM.


They've been reconfiguring the network around here in prep for 3G shutoff (we still have it active) and that could have caused a cell site near you to crash during the reconfig. (Remote network stuff, not anything on-site.)


The best bet for a resolution with these big soulless corps that don't pay attention to their customers (short of giving up on big carriers and asking the City of Longmont to start their own carrier) is for yourself and any other people you know to all call AT&T care, speak to a human, and have them file a trouble ticket on a service outage. That will (hopefully) get them to send a truck to check out the local sites.


I can also attest to what others have said, T-Mobile used to be the thing to use around here. Ever since the Sprint merger they now have random places around the city where you'll have full bars, no data, or voice calls will drop which never used to happen. They've really gone south fast. Verizon's network is a skeleton as they haven't kept up with growth over the last decade.

"I wonder what the plaintiffs believe will be the outcome of their lawsuit. 

Delays? Stoppage? 

Delays are possible. People simply want new things to throw into the landfill in 5 years, and reasonable deals on large quantities of highly processed foods (although they often have really good deals on fresh stuff as well). 

Stoppage? Oh lordy, no. Especially for the ""visual impact"" whimper. Have they seen the parking lots at the Twin Peaks mall? Hello, lack of landscaping. Where was the group when that went through? Or every other development in the City...like the legendary depot area. Or even the St Vrain redev...I mean it looks like the beat down, drier parts of Pueblo down in there. And then the traffic flow whine. I imagine this will simply delay things until a study shows the clustermuck it will create is similar to every other growth-induced clustermuck the City has allowed, and it will sail through just the same. I haven't heard of any other proposals for shepherding new commercial development through that look substantively different in the area. They do exist, of course. It's just that this isn't Silicon Valley or Rodeo Drive, or Carmel By The Sea. And this intriguing ""landscaping"" would be a departure by any measure from what was at the location at any time in the last century or two in terms of natural or cultivated fauna. Perhaps they would like some of those nice big Sabal Palms from Florida. From my understanding, the local paleontological evidence in the area shows nice, big palms were indigenous here shortly after everything got stomped out by an asteroid that ended the Mesozoic era. Lots and lots of palms. Bet they would sign off on that. But since then, largely dirt and grass. Lots and lots of grass. 

Growth has chronic and inevitable consequences. Perhaps the group could come forth and compare what is planned to some model developments that miraculously preserve the view scape with free range, cruelty free car parking and 100% organic and free trade traffic integration.

Larimer County is trying to block a pipeline for a rights holder (Thornton) to water from the Poudre. 

Background:

Just a little later: 
https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2021/08/12/northern-water-overturns-fort-collins-denial-nisp-pipeline/8107427002/

https://www.reporterherald.com/2022/01/22/north-weld-water-tap-moratorium-halts-building-permits-in-severance/

...including scores of permits already granted. This is literally screwing those that had permits. 

It sounds like there is blame in Larimer County's corner and in the District's corner. A genuine multi-agency cluster. Expect this to get a lot worse eventually- if not this issue (which is going to be huge), then then in some pending future issue. The District Courts are going to heat up a lot. There will have to be new State legislation to litigate and prevent the exceptional planning incompetence like this. 

Longmont is fortunate to have its own district and resources, bolstered by the firming project. People in the Longmont Water service area will be puzzled in the next few decades as these water issues go from green to yellow to red to explosive very quickly elsewhere. This is the tip of the iceberg. 

There are physical limits to development on the Front Range. It is growing fast. The moratorium issue in the article issue is a matter of infrastructure development- it will cost a crap ton of money to provide incrementally growing treated water supplies to the growth. But later, it will eventually run square up against the very real physical limits of water supply marked by increasingly climate-change driven volatility and declining supplies. 

The districts will simply jack up rates to accommodate incremental growth. There will be huge pressures from developers/whiners to shift impact and tap fees back to existing customers instead of applying the costs to the reasons for the growth- new taps. This happens all over. It essentially forces existing customers to pay for growth incurred by developers. They will complain if impact and tap fees reflect the actual impacts to the costs to the rest of the residents for their development, and the City will choose not to piss off the developers.",t2_kera537y,smallestpotatoes,0,1647734186.0,0,t1_i1ce1hx,i1ce1hx,True,monkkbfr,t3_ti77kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/ti77kx/north_weld_water_district_seeks_dismissal_of/,North Weld Water District seeks dismissal of lawsuit over tap moratorium,/r/Longmont/comments/ti77kx/north_weld_water_district_seeks_dismissal_of/i1ce1hx/,2,r/Longmont,0,2

The North Weld County Water District has filed a motion in Weld County District Court seeking dismissal of a lawsuit filed by Eagle View Farms LLC over the district’s tap moratorium.

The district imposed a moratorium on new taps in September, citing uncertainty over 1041 regulatory processes in Fort Collins and Larimer County over its planned NEWT III pipeline extending from North Timberline Road in Fort Collins 5.3 miles east into Larimer County.

North Weld also has acknowledged capacity issues stemming from the high rate of residential growth in the region, along with increased demand from commercial users, including dairies.

The moratorium was partially lifted in mid-February, with the district authorizing issuance of up to 120 taps in 2022, including 50 initially.

Eagle View Farms, which is developing a 24-lot residential community just west of Lucerne and north of Greeley at Colorado Highway 392 and Weld County Road 35, filed suit in early February, alleging violations of a Water Service Agreement through which North Weld agreed to provide water service for the project.

Eagle View seeks monetary damages in an amount to be determined, an injunction forcing the district to provide water service via taps for the project and other judgments, including attorney fees and expenses.

North Weld on Monday filed a motion to dismiss the case, arguing that the developer knew about the moratorium when it contracted to sell a lot in the Eagle View Farms development.

“While the moratorium was in place, and with full knowledge of the imposition of the moratorium, the developer apparently entered into a contract with a potential buyer to sell one of the lots subject to the WSA,” attorneys for the North Weld County Water District said in the court filing.

The filing asserts that the district did not breach its Water Service Agreement with Eagle View, referencing a December letter from the district to Eagle View that stated, “this letter is to confirm that the district does intend to fulfill its commitments made pursuant to the WSA when the district is able to resume settling water taps again.”

North Weld’s attorneys also stated that Eagle View “cannot mandate that the district provide taps in direct violation of a district policy.”

Attorneys for Eagle View Farms and North Weld did not immediately return calls for comment.

North Weld County Water District, is 2022CV30072.",t2_13vzk,monkkbfr,0,1647730736.0,0,t1_i1c6rkt,i1c6rkt,True,monkkbfr,t3_ti77kx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/ti77kx/north_weld_water_district_seeks_dismissal_of/,North Weld Water District seeks dismissal of lawsuit over tap moratorium,/r/Longmont/comments/ti77kx/north_weld_water_district_seeks_dismissal_of/i1c6rkt/,6,r/Longmont,0,6

"Stop this nonsense.  This may be true in some states but not in Colorado.

Green and yellow are both permissive lights, which means you have the legal right to enter the intersection.  Red is non permissive, and you do not have the right to enter the intersection.

Yellow does not mean “stop if you can”, it legally means “the light is about to turn red”.  Nothing more.

If any part of a vehicle crosses the stop line, they have technically entered the intersection.  This applies to both permissive and non-permissive signals, which is why you can get cited if you stop at a red light but have part of your vehicle past the line.

Colorado law is also pretty clear that vehicles may enter the intersection and stop/wait until it is clear to make a left turn.  There’s even a section of law saying drivers who get a green light must yield to the traffic which previously entered legally.

So long as your exit is clear, not the path to the exit but the actual exit on the other side of the intersection, you may pull into an intersection and wait to turn left.

The Colorado drivers manual says this behavior is discouraged because emergency vehicles may have a hard time navigating the intersection.  But the law itself is clear in that it’s legal to do.

So in summary:

- yellow does not mean stop.  It means the light is about to go red.   
- Colorado law allows vehicles to enter and wait to turn left (or right, or straight) so long as their exit is clear.   
- if you want to make inferences from that, that’s fine.

"\[Paywall (unfortunately I can't paste all the photos for you):\]

An average Wednesday morning turned frantic for Michael and Lisa Gianetti, when a series of explosions and a fire destroyed the detached garage behind their home at 134 Marshall Place in Longmont.  
  
“I was just looking out the bathroom window, when all of a sudden — kaboom,” Michael Gianetti said.  
  
Gianetti, whose bathroom window faces his detached garage, saw the door get blown off from the force of an explosion. Then he saw fire. He yelled for his wife to call 911. They grabbed their dog, Zoe, and ran out of the house.  
  
Longmont police are continuing to investigate the cause of the fire. Longmont police Sgt. Tim Madigan said no one was injured. He said police received the 911 call just before 6:40 a.m. He said there is no active danger to nearby residents.  
  
Police spokesperson Robin Ericson said in a news release that when officers arrived, the detached garage behind the home was fully engulfed. There were multiple explosions from propane tanks.  
  
Madigan said that when officers got to the scene, they heard three to four explosions.  
  
“It sounds like there was an initial explosion and then some subsequent ones,” he said. “The three or four (explosions) that happened after were post (fire).”  
  
While firefighters fought the flames, police officers evacuated nearby homes. Ericson said firefighters got the fire under control just after 7 a.m. Crews remained on scene to douse hot spots. At that time, neighboring residents were allowed back into their homes.  
  
Standing on his front lawn Wednesday, Gianetti said he has operated a hot air balloon business since the late ’90s. He used the garage as his workshop. Gianetti said he had stored roughly nine tanks of propane in the garage, and that Tuesday night when he was in the garage he had not smelled any leaks.  
  
Not much is left of the garage, Madigan said.  
  
“The walls are completely gone,” Madigan said. “It’s pretty charred.”  
  
Neighbor Isla Delgado, who lives on the east side of the Gianettis, said early this morning she heard her mom yelling that the neighbors’ house was on fire.  
  
“We got up, rushed out of the house and grabbed the (two) dogs,” Delgado said. “My brother heard an explosion. He thought that a tree had fallen down.”  
  
Outside, Delgado saw that there was fire burning right outside her bedroom window. Her initial reactions, she said, were panic and shock.  
  
“There were just these huge flames,” she said. “By the time we got out, the whole thing was in flames.”  
  
Other neighbors were running from their homes at the same time, she said.  
  
Gianetti said his workshop and two of his hot air balloons were destroyed in the blaze. While firefighters prevented the fire from spreading to their home, heat singed siding on the backside of their home, burned up their wooden patio and destroyed a utility trailer.  
  
While their home is still habitable, they aren’t able to return until their gas and power are turned back on.  
  
“I’m just worried about tonight with the storm moving in,” said Lisa Gianetti.  
  
The couple said they had been in communication with some friends in Lyons, who they might be able to stay with.  
  
Police said Lashley Street is closed between Fifth and Sixth avenues while crews work at the scene.

">built-in garden plot

Is it a raised bed? Usually people will fill raised beds with good soil so you might not have to worry about the clay soil issue. Good soil will be looser like potting soil, not clumpy. If it's good soil you can add in Earthworm Castings for an organic fertilizer that isn't heavy (like manure). 

I moved from TX 2 years ago and never had experience gardening so I was in the same boat as you. I've found the most important thing besides the soil is water: if you are like me (lazy lol) and don't see yourself committing to watering every day, it's best to automate it somehow. We built a ""SIP"" [sub-irrigated planter](http://albopepper.com/sips.php) to take care of that, but like others have mentioned you can also automate a drip line or sprinkler zone for that. 

Another thing I've learned is growing from seed vs. buying a seedling. For most types of common veggies, you can buy starter plants from stores which is easier to start out with and not too expensive. The growing season here is relatively short (May 15 - Oct 15) so you can ""extend"" the growing season by planting seedlings, or by starting seeds indoor earlier. I'm trying to start some seeds indoor this year with a heat mat/lights to see how that works.

">I used M&M heating/cooling. Their teams a bit hit and miss with heat pumps, you have to talk to Chris Lucarelli I think

That was my experience with them - I had them quote a heat pump install for me and ended up going with Welzig instead (and a Bryant unit) since they seemed much more familiar with heat pumps, but I guess I didn't talk to the right person at M&M (I was super happy with M&M with a recent tankless water heater install though). 

I would definitely recommend welzig though for anyone looking - they (and specifically their installer Saul) did a great job on my recent heat pump and furnace install, and I've been talking to them to come back and add a supplemental mini split for the garage and one stubborn room in the house that never gets enough air from the ducts and they actually talked me down a couple notches in cost from what I was originally thinking for that system, which was nice.

Edit: also, for anyone with a gas water heater that's getting close to needing replacement, a tankless is another great way to substantially reduce your gas usage, save a bunch of space in your mechanical room, reduce your risk of coming home to a wet basement, and also it's just nice to have unlimited hot water.

"Yeah, it's the 5 ton 284ANV with the scroll compressor. Not cheap, but no complaints about heating performance so far.

For less expensive units, I agree that the heating performance below freezing suffers (and even this one I'd never run without backup heat - I've looked at the output graph and it's *bad* under 5-10F or so, which is also when the heating demand is highest), but if you're replacing an A/C anyways, I don't see why you wouldn't pay the 10% extra to get rid of gas heating on mild days. You do still need a furnace of course, but presumably you'd need a furnace with the A/C too.

For a from-scratch system or one willing to do a lot of new work without reusing existing ducts and stuff, I do agree that a mini split is the way to go though (and I'm actually looking at adding one as an auxiliary for the garage so I can heat or cool that space when I'm out there working on my car).",t2_ck8ks26,rsta223,0,1647046802.0,0,t1_i0bbf7x,i0bbf7x,False,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

"There's almost no reason not to get one if you're replacing your AC anyways. The lower end ducted units only work well down to freezing or so admittedly, but the price delta over an equivalent SEER AC only unit is only about 10%, and we have a lot of mild days here during the winter that are well suited to heat pump usage.

You won't be able to fully eliminate gas unless you get a really high end ductless setup (I think those are rated down to -20 for the top of the line units these days), but don't let perfect be the enemy of the good - getting rid of any heating requirements on days above 32F still gets rid of a lot of gas usage (and higher end traditional ducted setups can go down to more like 10-15F before having to switch to backup heat, so even more of the gas usage is eliminated in that case).

My brand new Bryant that can do full output down to 15F would like a word with you.

Sure, mini splits are the best option for pure efficiency, but a more ""traditional"" setup can still absolutely be worth it if you're replacing an existing AC and want to be able to reuse all the ducting and don't want to add the additional heads indoors.

You're right that you still need a gas backup (or electric resistive backup, though I don't see why you'd install this kind of system if you didn't already have a traditional forced air setup anyways - starting from scratch a mini split is a no brainer in my opinion), but you can pretty dramatically cut your gas usage still.",t2_ck8ks26,rsta223,0,1647045820.0,0,t1_i0b9g4q,i0b9g4q,False,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

"Geothermal, 5 tons, with in floor heating and integrated hot water, a slightly used but really inexpensive 92% efficient 80 kBtu gas boiler backup, and a fireplace that can keep all 2600 sqft at 75F on about 3-5 lbs/hr of wood if desired. 

The boiler is basically never used so far, although the duty cycle on the geothermal has stayed on close to 70% of the time during the coldest weather. If we get to -20 for an extended period of time in the future (it happens occasionally), the boiler or fireplace may be needed to supplement to keep things warm. I have to fire up the furnace manually occasionally just to make sure it is in functioning condition. 

I did it all myself/hired a drill crew, and my bills went from $200+ a month for the old 80% efficient gas furnace to about $80 a month extra in electricity, and then to nearly zero with the 10kWh of net metered solar. I actually produce more energy now than I consume. It was a lot of work, but the hardest part of all was keeping the drill rig for the geothermal well out of sight from the County. I didn't bother with permits for any of it except the net metered solar. 

The neighbors want to try and get theirs done the same way. 

Geothermal is great in the area if you do it yourself. It is silly expensive to hire it out. The water table is often very shallow, and your drilling will only need to be on the order of a few at 200-300 feet to get a 10 degree temperature difference for the ground flow portion to feed a 5 ton heat pump at around 47F at worst (usually ~53F outflow year around).

We do not use it much, but the AC on a 100F day is so efficient that the system will only run about 15 minutes per hour at worst with our insulation. 

If you want to stay conventional, there are lots of good suggestions in the thread, including from u/aduckedupgoose.

"I'm an HVAC engineer and can certainly talk about heat pumps especially if you have specific questions. You're right to look at mini splits in particular (such as Mitsubishi, LG, or Daikin). ""Traditional heat pumps"" (such as Trane, Lenox, and carrier) all have terrible heating performance. We always design these systems with backup electric heat. Traditional heat pumps only have 100% heating performance down to around 40 something degrees f. 

Mini splits are more efficient and have a bit better heating performance, but still are only providing around 70% capacity at 10 degrees f. If you're looking to have dedicated heat pump, make sure you're getting what's called cold climate technology. It basically just over drives the compressor getting more heat performance at the cost of efficiency. 

Mitsubishi calls their cold climate equipment hyper heat and LG calls it red I think. All the major manufacturers have it under different names. Unless you're using this cold climate equipment I'd recommend having some backup heat installed, either electric resistance or gas.",t2_1166i4,aDuckedUpGoose,0,1647020501.0,0,t1_i09kskf,i09kskf,True,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

You definitely need a backup heating system here with heat pumps.  If you insulate your house and do some air sealing, it makes a really big difference, but you’ll still need backup heat.

"I got a heat pump in November, with a backup furnace.  The heat pump does a great job till about 20F, then the furnace starts to have to carry more of the load. It still provides heating below that, but the furnace picks up more.  Total energy bill has definitely decreased.  If you’re replacing both a furnace & ac unit, it’s pretty price comparable if you’re getting a standard model.  I splurged for a higher efficiency mod though, so the cost was higher for me.

City power is >50% carbon free now, and staged to be 100% by 2030.  If you’re climate concerned, this is the way to <1.5C warming.

Check out the Efficiency Works program first, there’s a lot of rebates you can get.",t2_fe4h44m,lepatterso,0,1647008075.0,0,t1_i08q0yb,i08q0yb,True,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

"Installed mini splits for bedrooms last spring. Highly recommend kappler mechanical. They do tons and had better plans to position them and the linesets compared to local places and they were similarly priced.

Not only on a per unit basis are they more efficient than whole house AC, but you also don't need to use them as much/everywhere at once.  E.g., there are a lot more days you don't need any ac in our main floor and just run the mini splits a bit before bed.

I also have a whole house fan that I installed when we moved that lets us open up the windows in the morning and bring the temp inside way down (except when wildfire smoke is too much).

In terms of heating, I still wouldn't recommend them. The Mitsubishi we have tanks the efficiency less than 17 and doesn't work lower than ~5. They make a version with onboard resistive heating to allow it to operate in lower temps, but expect it to run 24/7 and be expensive under 0.

Even at warmer temps (40), our existing gas furnace costs much less theoretically to run.  I did computation with cop and existing electric/gas rates and it wasn't even close. We'd probably still have to double gas prices to break even.

Overall, I'd recommend them for individual comfort and lower carbon footprint more than cost.  They are very expensive relative to your whole house unit and I'm not certain you would recoup the difference in savings over 20years.",t2_a85qn,Purpl3Unicorn,0,1647006213.0,0,t1_i08m50f,i08m50f,True,astroFizzics,t3_tbpy7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/tbpy7l/have_a_heat_pump_do_you_like_it/,Have a heat pump?

"I'm looking at this Stack Exchange entry, and I'm pretty skeptical of the argument. IRV does have a spoiler effect, but it's not that cut-and-dry to understand. And in that post they try to argue against ranked choice systems more broadly, by using a carefully chosen example case. They draw a graph that seems to imply that yellow and green are trying to form a coalition, then they imply that the voting system is incorrectly letting red win instead. But their scenario has almost 80% of green-first voters ranking red over yellow. So it's not much of a coalition, is it!  
If a voting system does something you don't like, you have to really figure out if you don't like it because it's an unfair outcome, or if it's because it's an outcome you just don't like. And the sticky part is that the only way to figure out if a voting system is unfair is to find or invent another voting system that is more fair. But as we get deeper into the weeds, we get closer to ties and chaos, and then fairness becomes very difficult to discern.  
This is why IRV is a good choice. It's fair \*enough\*, it's easy to explain, and people already use it for major elections.",t2_j0o0xmcm,proDemocracyTroll,0,1646887345.0,0,t1_i02iayr,i02iayr,False,AutoModerator,t3_t6q7ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/Longmont/comments/t6q7ms/weekly_open_discussion_complaint_and_rant_thread/,"Weekly open discussion, complaint, and rant thread",/r/Longmont/comments/t6q7ms/weekly_open_discussion_complaint_and_rant_thread/i02iayr/,2,r/Longmont,0,2

"In my nerdy heart, I have more love for the Condorcet method, which I learned about from CS50. But once I looked into it, I learned that the reason ranked choice voting is used synonymously with instant runoff voting is because politically, instant runoff voting has by far the most traction. This is because IRV is the easiest ranked choice voting method to explain, and it is also the only RCV method that is currently in use in general elections.

In any case, makes sure you know what you’re paying for. Some of these companies will try to trap you into paying all sorts of ridiculous fees—like “payment portal fees” when they won’t accept any other payment methods. Another trick is to get you to pay them for the utilities by not putting them in your name, and then charging you per month for “handling” it. 

Also make sure that you get all promises in writing. Repairs, paint, carpet, whatever.

"It's especially odd in light of their claim that all of their social events are held online. I assumed that the ""FT WFHrs only"" rule was in place to protect the group from overexposure to Covid. In essence, keeping gatherings limited so only those who restrict their movements and interactions can attend. 

I don't know what other circumstances are so unique to FT WFHrs that PT workers or otherwise couldn't respect or identify with them. And, if the group exists to provide social interaction for people who are uniquely distanced from others, then what makes this group so special, compared to every other group on discord if it *really* only entails online interactions? And further, why, if it's all online does anyone's physical location matter? 

This person really sounds like someone who likes control, and is accustomed to being at the center of attention. The stereotypical Reddit mod type, trying to play mod IRL. No wait, not in real life.. just on a different online platform. Apparently.

I'm puzzled too over what they mean by needing to keep the group to a manageable size. If you're not picking a venue, counting seating, arranging refreshments, or passing around copies of anything.. then WTF restricts how many people can easily ""attend"" your events?

"I wonder how similar our games are. Two chairs at each end of the table, your teammate sitting next to you. Each person has a solo cup placed on the table in front of them (a hand's width from the edge, and elbow to thumb length from the end). You throw the die with the back of your hand facing forward (wrist basically locked). Die has to hit the table, then bounce to the floor without your opponents catching it. If they don't catch it off the bounce, you get a point. If the die goes straight into your opponent's cup, that's a ""plunk."" No points are awarded, but your opponents have to finish their beers, and the plunk gets recorded in sharpie on the table. If it's your first plunk, your opponents (or everyone else in the room) assigns you a ""die name"" which is yours for life. Your die name gets written on the table and the plunk is tallied.
