"There are several types. Lispro, Aspart, and Glulisine are rapid acting insulins for immediate blood sugar reduction, but don’t last. Regular insulin (called regular, not necessary just average insulin) is a fast acting (different than rapid acting). NPH is an intermediate acting. Then you have detemir and glargine that are long acting insulins.

Those are just the individual forms, but many people either take a combination of several of these individuals or a premixed form with various concentrations of the above.

"You'll love the drive!  I'm assuming you're route will take you through Madison, down through St. Louis and then into Arkansas.  About 5 or so miles after you enter Arkansas you will come to a town called Corning.  Turn East on Hwy 62 and drive about 20 miles to Piggot, AR to visit the [Hemingway-Pfeiffer Museum](https://hemingway.astate.edu/) where Hemingway wrote most of ""A Farewell to Arms"". 

As you continue your journey south, you can stop in Walnut Ridge and visit [Beatles Park](https://www.arkansas.com/walnut-ridge/attractions-culture/beatles-park) .

If you travel Rock n' Roll Hwy 67 on south, you will encounter the town of Newport, AR - home of the Rock and Roll Hwy 67 museum, as well as the Arnett Doll museum.

When you get to Bald Knob, and if you have the time, it's worth it to stop at The Bull Dog drive-in to get some of the best strawberry shortcake you've ever had in your life.  Bald Knob is also the home of a national wildlife refuge.  

As you travel further south, in North Little Rock you will find the [Old Mill](https://www.arkansas.com/north-little-rock/attractions-culture/old-mill-tr-pugh-memorial-park) which was featured in the opening credits of the 1939 film ""Gone with the Wind"".  It is also home to some of the best faux bois concrete sculpture in the US.  

Of course, Little Rock has the [Clinton Library](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/) and many other interesting places to visit, such as [The MacArthur Museum of Military History](https://www.littlerock.gov/residents/parks-and-recreation/park-facility-trail-information/macarthur-museum-of-arkansas-military-history/)  and many other places that can be found with a casual internet search.

You will then come to your stay at Hot Springs, which has a host of things to see and do, such as the Gangster Museum, the bath row, Tiny Town, or you can dig for crystals and just one hour away is the Crater of Diamonds, where you can actually go out and search for diamonds that you get to keep.

It is historically warm here at that time of year (upper 80's to mid 90's) and humid.  Think Guam without the language barrier.  Mosquitos and chiggers are ubiquitous and ticks are notorious for hiding in body places you can't reach.  A good insect repellent should help you immensley when you are hiking.

"No. I cannot imagine a life like that and I can only assume it's a mentality that comes from living in a large city where everything costs an arm and leg, you don't need or have a car because there's public transportation everywhere and your job can literally be 6 blocks away. 

Idk about anyone here but that doesn't sound enjoyable. I really enjoy living in the countryside away from the insanity of the city. Living isn't ""affordable"" but it definitely isn't $1900 / Month apartment expensive. I've got a car that allows me to go wherever I want whenever I want outside my city/ county or state.

"Lol, okay guy.  Just say you're cool with millions suffering, especially if they're overweight.  

And there isn't for necessities.  Capitalism doesn't apply to necessities, because we have no way of affecting demand.  We need healthcare, and they know that.

Also, if capitalism worked, we'd be doing better.  We have the most expensive healthcare and the worst patient outcomes of the top 11 wealthiest nations.  We're also the only ones without universal healthcare.

Have a little pride and a little love for your neighbors.  It doesn't have to be this way.  You could pay a lot less and get a lot more for your money, but there are entire industries and buildings full of people dedicated to getting the elites rich, and part of their job is selling you the lie that this is as good as it gets, that it's working (lol), and that people are responsible for their own misfortune.

"Fauci said: A person who's had the flu has stronger immunity than someone who just had a vaccine, and therefore doesn't need to go get the shot if they've already been sick.

1. That is for the flu, not covid, which is a completely different disease, and has different risks.
2. THAT STILL DOESN'T MEAN IT IS SAFER TO JUST GET THE FLU TO GET YOUR IMMUNITY. IT JUST MEANS IF YOU'VE ALREADY HAD IT A VACCINE ISN'T GOING TO ADD MUCH HELP.
3. Covid and Flu vaccines have wildly different protection rates.  Flu vaccines have fairly low success rates, like around 40%, because there are so many strains and they mutate so fast. Covid vaccines used in the US have over 80% success rates.
4. The flu does not cause blood clots, stroke, and widespread organ damage. Covid does.

&#x200B;

There is no reason to compare the two and anyone who thinks this video is some kind of ""gotcha"" moment on Fauci is a fucking idiot.

This is partially to blame but largely it can be attributed to public policy and personal accountability of the people in those areas where it ran rampant.,t2_9r8kb,unhcasey,0,1648772852.0,0,t1_i2x67an,i2x67an,False,Gator_Mc_Klusky,t3_ttaopa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/ttaopa/deaths_attributed_to_covid19_over_the_past_year/,Deaths attributed to COVID-19 over the past year.,/r/Arkansas/comments/ttaopa/deaths_attributed_to_covid19_over_the_past_year/i2x67an/,9,r/Arkansas,0,9
"It seems like most of that is in the northwest part of the state, so I'd probably suggest staying 2-3 days in Fayetteville or Bentonville since they have the most going on in their downtowns, but Rogers and Springdale have also built up their downtown areas, so anywhere in the metro could work well.

Day 1: Explore the city/metro area. Crystal Bridges is great. The Amazeum is good for kids. You may enjoy walking parts of the Greenway. Heading north out of downtown Springdale is really pretty, and the parts around Lake Fayetteville are also nice.

Day 2: Head down to Devil's Den for some hiking. Head south afterwards instead of straight back to Fayetteville and drive the scenic highway back. There are a few outlooks and swimming holes throughout that area near West Fork as others have mentioned. 

Day 3: I personally love the War Eagle Mill and Hobbs Conservation Area. There are places to swim and a ton of hikes at every length and skill/fitness level very close by.

Day 4: I might head over towards Eureka Springs. The town itself is pretty and has a lot to do, and there are a handful of short hikes around there worth doing.

Day 5: I'd head south towards Huntsville or Jasper. Huntsville keeps you closer to NWA, and there are some really nice hikes like Lost Valley, Glory Hole, and the King's River Falls trail, which also ends at a great swimming hole, that are all within a reasonable drive of Huntsville. A warning that some of these hikes are underwhelming if it hasn't rained in the past week, especially Glory Hole. Jasper is also pretty close to those hikes but gives quicker access to the Buffalo River, which has a lot of the best views in the Ozarks.",t2_ddogt,Dragnil,0,1648772822.0,0,t1_i2x650i,i2x650i,True,Working-Office-7215,t3_tso6g1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/tso6g1/family_road_trip_ar/,Family Road Trip - AR,/r/Arkansas/comments/tso6g1/family_road_trip_ar/i2x650i/,2,r/Arkansas,0,2

"I didn’t say you were a man.  I said I was.  I was noting that because I am white that I rarely get accused of playing the “race card”.   Which you accused ME of and not the other way around.   

Being related to people of color doesn’t mean you can’t be racist.  My father was a racist pig and had mixed grandchildren.   

Nor does having black friends exclude you from being racist.   I know a lot of white people who have a black friend.   

Just to help you along racism isn’t just about hating a skin color.   It is about accepting and believing stereotypes about a race of people.   Bigotry however is different.   Bigotry is about an intolerance for people who do not share your views.  

I would suggest you learn the history of the state you call home.   The Little Rock 9 were nine black children that had to be escorted by the 101st Airborne into a school in Little Rock while white people screamed racist insults.   

Sundowner communities were towns that had signs warning Black People not to be in their communities after dark.   

And Harrison Arkansas, even today, may be the most racist city in America.   It is the home of white supremacy groups with a long history of racism.   There are some really interesting social media videos of them in all of their glory.

"1) Plan for a longer drive. I mean, it could be three hours, it could be four. Most everything following this is more related to Bentonville:

2) Food trucks are plenty and probably some of the better options for the area you are hitting. There are a few one-of-a-kind places on the Bentonville Square - these are nicer places.

3) Not a pro Kayaker, but with the recent rain, the rivers will likely be a little fast and the water is still chilly. You do have to have POA Pass(?) for Bella Vista waters proving you have a ""membership"" / property owner. I generally kayak up in MO or down around Eureka Springs.

4) It's worth hitting Crystal Bridges if you are into museums. Besides the free admission and art, the buildings and surrounding areas are also beautiful. There's also a Native American Cultural Center right off of the business highway through Bentonville.

Many people get Bachelor’s in Agriculture, such as: Agribusiness Management, Agronomy, Animal Science, or General Agriculture. That’s not even to mention people who genetically modify crops to feed more people with less water, or engineers who create farming equipment.

Plumbers require multi year apprenticeships, which are on the job training, yes.

 maybe there is a law against it? i know there is an audio law

\[Under federal law, audio recording is permitted if at least one party to the conversation has given consent, which is the default for 38 states. This means that if you, the patient, wants to record a clinical encounter, you can do so without the doctor or health care provider's consent.\]

i,m sorry for these people's issues I am by no means justifying the doctor's action.

but I have never had any issues like this true I am an older male (57) and there aren't any doctors out there that would want to mess around with me lol

i,m just saying if you don't have an attending nurse in the room or feel uncomfortable ask the doctor to be recorded for later review because you have a bad memory and if they refuse then find maybe find a doctor that wouldn't mind.

it would seem to me that a doctor might like the ideal it would cover their butts (no pun intended)",t2_efjuf4zw,Gator_Mc_Klusky,0,1648642923.0,0,t1_i2pfoj3,i2pfoj3,True,Baron-Munc,t3_tr2ms2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/tr2ms2/nwa_doctor_accused_of_conducting_inappropriate/,NWA doctor accused of conducting inappropriate exams,/r/Arkansas/comments/tr2ms2/nwa_doctor_accused_of_conducting_inappropriate/i2pfoj3/,-1,r/Arkansas,0,-1

"I am female and have been seeing Dr. Maass at least 4 times a year, every year, since 2004 for my type 1 diabetes. He has literally been the absolute best physician I have ever encountered (and after 25+ yrs of type 1 diabetes wreaking havoc on my body, I have seen a LOT of medical professionals across many specializations). He's always been kind, caring, and professional. His dedication to caring for his patients and helping them get educated on how to manage their disease and thrive has been a major point of admiration for me, not to mention the miracles he's worked on my a1cs and helping with my issues/anxieties surrounding my care due to a previous, horrible endocrinologist.

I am both shocked and saddened at these accusations, and certainly upset at people who have never interacted with him instantly demonize him - y'all need to stop that. You can be supportive of the women in this case without being horrible before we hear the findings of the investigation.

For context, I have a MAJOR issue with trust when it comes to men,  thanks to abuse & other things I dont want to go into here, so having a male doctor is rare for me - none of my other doctors are - but after the initial awkwardness of meeting a new doctor fir your first appointment, I have always felt comfortable and safe with him. I have never once had any kind of issue with him examining me inappropriately, and we're talking more than 70 examinations at this point (just saw him last week for my my most recent 3 month appt).

"Our 7-day average of new cases per day per 100k is finally below 10  for the first time since June 2021, and hospitalizations are the lowest they've been since May 2020.

Going forward, I plan to stop posting here once the 7-day average of new cases stay below 10/day/100k for 3 consecutive days, and I will only resume posting if cases or hospitalizations start showing an upward trend.

For the time being, I will continue to update the website, twitter, and facebook, as well as sending daily emails for those signed up for those.

Hopefully we don't see another big wave due to our shamefully low vaccination numbers, and maybe this can be a thing of the past before too long!

"I have lived in the Bentonville area for the last 17 years.   I think that Bentonville has always been conservative in the same way that most Southern Baptists are Christians.   

They put on a good show when in public, but as anyone who has made a run to Macadoodles (a liquor store just over the border in Missouri) when Bentonville was a “dry” county, we all know that they may have not wanted the appearance of bars and liquor stores…but they sure the hell were bribing gallons into the county every weekend.   

People just pretend to have a religious stick up their behinds, the majority don’t really live it.   Medical Marijuana is thriving here and by the number of elderly patients, it isn’t a new thing.   I had an old man threaten to kick my ass because he was in such a rush to get in to buy his weed.   

I like seeing the LGBTQ flags on the square and the same sex couples on the walking trails.   

I would do a short term rental in each and try them.   Hell, I am almost tempted to sell the house and land an move into Bentonville.   It would be nice to walk to the farmer’s market on the square.  There are a ton of great restaurants in Bentonville and they aren’t so far apart.   And the coffee shops are awesome.   

There are several breweries in the area that have great food trucks near by.   And of you are into biking, there are awesome bike shops and riding clubs.   

I am in Fayetteville frequently, but what I live about a Bentonville is the small town feel, even though I know it isn’t such a small town anymore.  

Yup, I am so old that nothing was south of Hwy 102 and it was a farms land until you got to where the Harbor Freight store is in Rogers.

"Sigh, you may want to read up on the laws in those states.   Legislation for gun control has been passed by both parties.   Including Governor Schwarzenegger.   People label California as a blue state, but it is really a strongly mixed state.   

You lost a long time ago.   A master sergeant I served with in the 80’s once explained to me that when a government is allowed to take away any protected rights from any demographic, the nation loses.   

Because once you begin taking rights for safety, when do you stop?   A Republican created homeland security in 2001.   Do you see them reducing the security standards now that Trump signed a treaty with the Taliban?   

The government just makes laws to oppress people.   They never make laws to give people back what they have taken away.   The courts do that, and now the courts are all rigged.   Even the Supreme Court is tainted.

"There are some GOP gun grabbing turds. I get that.

But overall, the Dems are worse for gun rights. Look at far left Democratic States like California, New York, etc. Tell me how their gun laws compare to Arkansas and Texas. Sure you can cherry pick some turds here and there, but overall states with left leaning governments have more gun restrictions, and less gun rights.

Do you consider the Assault Weapon Ban a recent ban? It is more recent than others you mentioned and it was not a GOP ban.

If they could have foreseen how people would use the right of free speech to drive their fellow Americans to suicide, they most likely would have had a differing view.   

They were trying to avoid making a country where religion is manipulated for financial gain at the cost of freedoms.   America has become what they were trying to prevent.   

Ministers were actually forbidden from holding political office in America.  They were right.   Look at all of the toxic ministers that influence our nation as politicians.   We wouldn’t have Mike Huckabee spewing toxicity if not for the change to the Constitution.  And as a result Sarah Sanders wouldn’t be running for office.   

The $200 tax in 1934 is the equivalent of $4000 today.  Especially in America just 5 years into the Great Depression, their goal was to make owning the firearm financially impossible for the common man.   

Not every ban is a “ban”.   The goal of politicians in 1934 was to use taxes to keep machine guns off of the street.  It worked.  

The question is SHOULD the 2nd Amendment apply to modern arms?  I can’t imagine feeling less comfortable that at the thought that some moron (like the oath keepers) could have access to modern machine guns.

"When the founding fathers wrote the 1st Amendment, did they know the internet would exist? With advancements in technology, speech and media has undergone a transformation that I doubt the founding fathers ever imagined.

See how dumb that sounds?

Also: laws should not change AND THEN the constitution change. If you want laws to infringe, you should amend the constitution first. Doing it backwards is, well, unconstitutional.

If not, why should the first Amendment apply to those things if the 2nd Amendment doesn't apply to modern arms?

I support GOP over Democrats on gun issues because while there are some turds in the GOP that have done bad things for gun rights the Democrats are typically worse. How about the Assault Weapon Ban? That did nothing good. That stats even show it did nothing good.

And no, machine guns were NOT outlawed in 1934. They were added to the NFA and required a tax stamp that was (and still is) $200. Why is that important? $200 at that time was much more expensive than the firearms and it was meant to punish the poor and limit distribution of such firearms to poorer individuals.

Just because the GOP is bad doesn't mean the Democrats aren't worse. Look at gun laws in Arkansas vs gun laws in California. Then look at other red vs blue states.

"Just to be the Devil’s Advocate, when the founding fathers wrote the 2nd Amendment, was there really a difference in the weapons used by the military and civilians?   No, actually most civilians took their rifles with them to war.  

With advancements in technology, firearms have undergone a transformation that I doubt that the founding fathers ever imagined.   As a result, it is fair an reasonable that laws change and the Constitution should be amended accordingly.   

To say that we should hold a promise as it was written 240 years ago without reconsidering what that means to our society is ludicrous.  There are changes that were made to the 2nd Amendment (like outlawing mail order firearms) that were strictly a political move.   Mail order guns were outlawed after the Kennedy Assassination.   Because that is how Lee Harvey Oswald purchased the rifle.   Bump stocks were outlawed after the Vegas mass shooting.   When 58 people were killed.

During my reading on Bump Stocks, they were made legal by a Democratic President and outlawed by a Republican President.    How do you rationalize continuing to support the GOP over Democrats?   

Machine Guns were outlawed in 1934 and the van was updated under Reagan.   Trump expanded the ban to include bump stocks.   When the bam was passed the GOP controlled the White House and both houses of Congress.

"High visibility, yes.   But she isn’t qualified to be a Governor.   She has exactly zero experience as an elected official.   She has no corporate or business experience on the scale of running a state government.   Her education is limited to political science and mass communications.   

Her advantage is her daddy was a former Governor and she worked for the Former President.   

I didn’t bring up race.   But if you look at the history and present state of Arkansas, people of color don’t really have a chance.   The ACLU is about to revive action because Arkansas has so few black circuit court judges.   

I would also encourage you to got to Arkansas Department of Corrections website and do an inmate search.   You will find that about 49% of them are black in a state where black men account for less than 20% of the population.

"I live in southwest Rogers by Cave Springs, so might be a happy middle. I’m 15-20 from Dickson Street and same distance to Bentonville Square. And downtown Rogers too.  Five minutes from the Pinnacle shopping area, the Amp, etc. IMO, Bentonville and Rogers kind of blend together and Springdale and Fayetteville feel like they do their own thing, tho truly it’s all clustered together. 

I hate commutes, even short ones, and the drive from Fayetteville to Bentonville feels longer than it really is. And that’s coming from someone who has lived in Dallas and Seattle, so I get a long commute. It’s weird what you get used to so quickly. 

Ultimately I think you’ll feel safe in either spot, but might enjoy life more living in Fayetteville. 

Fayetteville might be preferable because of your age as well, tho, because it definitely skews a little older up here.",t2_13283p,caleeksu,0,1648219683.0,0,t1_i22khvr,i22khvr,True,Past-Vermicelli,t3_tne1gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/tne1gv/relocating_from_the_east_coast_bentonville_or/,Relocating from the East Coast : Bentonville or Fayetteville?,/r/Arkansas/comments/tne1gv/relocating_from_the_east_coast_bentonville_or/i22khvr/,3,r/Arkansas,0,3

"Housing prices in Fayetteville are high...like HIGH.  If you can't find a place in Bentonville (which isn't as progressive as one might think), look in Rogers.  Rogers has a fairly high immigrant population while also having a nicer downtown area than Fayetteville.  Housing is a little less expensive, and it's a quick jaunt to Bentonville.",t2_l1jrk92f,ArkansasHardMod,0,1648219407.0,0,t1_i22jtmk,i22jtmk,True,Past-Vermicelli,t3_tne1gv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arkansas/comments/tne1gv/relocating_from_the_east_coast_bentonville_or/,Relocating from the East Coast : Bentonville or Fayetteville?,/r/Arkansas/comments/tne1gv/relocating_from_the_east_coast_bentonville_or/i22jtmk/,3,r/Arkansas,0,3
