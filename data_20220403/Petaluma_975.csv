I was a longtime Sonic fiber customer in Oakland. It really is the best connection and customer service. We recently moved to Petaluma and could only get the super slow service from Sonic. We have underground wires so no Fiber from them right now. I begrudgingly had to go with Comcast. They originally said I could get their Gigabit Pro Fiber installed then took it back when they calculated the costs to run the fiber line. Their standard gigabit connection is decent for $70/month. The upload speeds are way slower than symmetrical fiber but it'll get the job done for most people.

"Petaluma is very limited with selections for sure unfortunately unless you are in the lucky area where [Sonic.net](https://Sonic.net) covers. I would say if you are upgrading your connection, Comcast might be your only option if Sonic fiber isn't at your location. Worth checking their site and put your address in to see. If you are like me and stuck with Comcast, they are doing a promotion where you can get the 1Gb service for $70/m with a 1 year contract. If you need unlimited data transfer, they also have a deal where you can sign up for xFi using their modem and get free unlimited as well.

- Petaluma Coffee and Tea Company 
- Petaluma Pet Company 
- Anna’s Seafood 

Parklets have been super popular here so if you want to dine outdoors, you totally can! 

We also have our own delivery service and it’s amazing! I use it all the time haha. 

Since you’ll be in downtown Petaluma, def take a walk by the river. It’s super pretty. There’s also farmers markets that happens all over Petaluma too but I haven’t been to them. 

If you’re on Facebook, there are two major groups that’s Petaluma centric and 99% drama free, I promise! They’re both community focused and love hyping the community up.

One of the biggest factors is that we have a ton of family and community (which we lack in the midwest) in the northbay, and so quality of life in that regard would increase immensely.

"I think you're absolutely right here.

It would be wildly unprofitable for Instacart to ban too many of their customers even if they are scammers. They don't want to risk a shopper making a mistake and blaming the wrong person. They could lose a lot of innocent customers that way because we shoppers are known to make a lot if mistakes. If they banned every single fraud report, 75% of their customers would most likely be innocent lol.

I bet you that IC doesn't mind reporting their losses on their taxes. It probably helps them out a ton when it comes to lowering their tax liability as a company.

They probably give each person a ""threshold"" and will refrain from banning you unless you cross the line and steal too much too frequently.

We downgraded to an apartment cause we could no longer afford to rent a house. The house we lived in sold for more than the asking price too. Same happened to us happened to other people.

"Typical summer and fall days are sunny or overcast or somewhere in between. The vast majority of evenings, as the sun sets fog is brought in from the coast on cool winds. So days are typically 65-85 and nights are pretty consistently in the 50s. Basically, nice days and cool nights. But not consistently sunny. In fact, Novato, Sonoma, and Santa Rosa are all a bit warmer and sunnier- they get less ocean fog.

""the sky is clear, mostly clear, *or partly cloudy 92%* of the time""

Winter is short, we do not have consistent rain like you would see in WA or OR. We have heavy rain and fog then sunny days. Essentially, winter is sporadic, some weekends might be 70F and sunny, then the next week it'll be pouring rain then the next it'll be cool and windy. This period lasts from about December to February. 

Then it warms up again and the rain stops.

It occurs to me that it sounds like you're looking for a 'california-dreamin' postcard-type town. Always sunny, near a nice beach, etc. If that's the case you might want look at places a bit further south- SLO and Santa Barbara come to mind. If you visited here during a heat wave, well that's going to skew your perception- it's not usually that hot. That being said, the whole of CA is getting hotter and this summer had some record breakers, I'm betting that trend will continue.

"The east side of Petaluma will feel like mostly any suburb in CA. There are some decent and good restaurants, strip malls, and there are a few breweries to visit, but nothing is centralized or walkable. One option for the many that live there is to simply drive to the west side on their nights out, or catch a cab. It's a very short drive or bike.

If you enjoy bars, restaurants and theaters, downtown Petaluma and the west side have that. It is not going to come anywhere near London, but I would say there are about 12 blocks of food, shopping, bars, and entertainment. None of Petaluma is particularly dangerous.

There are schools all over Petaluma. They vary in quality.

Yes people drive to the beach; if you look at a map you can see pretty instantly what is nearby- beaches in Marin, beaches in Bodega / Tomales bay. They are nice but this is the Pacific Ocean- the weather is testy and the seas are cold and generally unforgiving, so it's not a general hangout spot since it is not often nice out. There are small lakes/ponds and a big river (Russian River) nearby.

There are a million things to consider when buying a house and frankly around here, AC is really low priority. It has been hotter more recently, but take a look at weatherspark and compare Petaluma to wherever you are to get a sense of the average temperature. It's rarely over 90. I work in construction and even newer, multi-million dollar properties in Sonoma and Marin county do not have AC (heat only). If your house is well-insulated you can get by most of the time by simply opening your windows and night and closing them in the day. (Note the exception of insane heat waves like we had recently). I would prioritize things like a quality roof, plumbing, electrical, etc., over AC.

Go on google street view and move out each direction from downtown. You will see that most of the houses are pretty old. That doesn't mean bad, but there is the potential for more issues especially if you are on a tight budget. There are a few newer tracts of housing but most of them are fairly far from downtown. If you want something built post-1990, walking distance from downtown, you will be either paying a lot (think 1m) or getting something small.",t2_9tn90,kmsilent,0,1598994370.0,0,t1_g3n4q3k,g3n4q3k,False,RelevantDisk,t3_ikb5fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petaluma/comments/ikb5fo/questions_about_locations_for_house/,Questions about locations for house,/r/Petaluma/comments/ikb5fo/questions_about_locations_for_house/g3n4q3k/,3,r/Petaluma,0,3

"thank you so much that is super useful, will check out everything! and yes I do like eggs :) I have some follow up questions if you don't mind answering:
1) Reg schools, we don't have kids yet. I noticed that both schools are in Eastern Petaluma. I read somewhere that Eastern Site is considered ""boring"" and there is not much live/going on there, while Western site is where all restaurants, bars are. We did drive by Eastern parts and we got similar feeling. Is that correct? Or maybe there are some nice hidden places in Eastern Petaluma to go out that only locals know? 
2)We like dinning out and unusual dinning experiences! We lived in London before and it was great place with great vibe and restaurants, bars, theaters etc. Are there any other restaurants/bars/places that you would recommend to check out? 
4)Petaluma comes across as a safe place, but i wanted to check. Are there any places either in Petaluma itself or around that you do not recommend to go either late evenings or avoid at all?
5)Do you guys drive to the beach from P? if so, which one? Or maybe there is a nice big lake near by with a beach? I did some research but i didnt find anything. Also the Stinson beach (which seems the closest) is mega touristic so it will be always packed. 
I know I have a lot of questions, so I apologize in advance for taking your time but if you could cover some of these that will help us million in our decision of buying in P!.",t2_1peyzylq,RelevantDisk,0,1598961712.0,0,t1_g3ks74v,g3ks74v,False,RelevantDisk,t3_ikb5fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petaluma/comments/ikb5fo/questions_about_locations_for_house/,Questions about locations for house,/r/Petaluma/comments/ikb5fo/questions_about_locations_for_house/g3ks74v/,2,r/Petaluma,0,2

"I'm bad at reddit! But I was trying to share about the break in and car theft that occurred yesterday at my moms apartment outside of Petaluma City Limits on Petaluma Blvd N. 

Any shares or leads/tips GREATLY appreciated! 

Here's the details from my Facebook post linked above. 

PLEASE READ AND SHARE!!! My mom's apartment in Petaluma was broken into last night, while she slept in her bedroom, by a man who stole a broken piece of karaoke equipment, her purse and her car!!!  This happened in the early morning hours of 8/25/2020.

Date: 8/25/2020
Time: 3:30am - 4:30am
Car: 2006 Ford Taurus (Blue)
Reported to: Sonoma County Sheriff

My mom lives in an apartment above a bar establishment outside of City limits in Petaluma (not sharing the name for safety reasons, she's lost all sense of security right now). 

On the parking lot security camera, a man can be seen rummaging through my mom's neighbors car, and looking in the windows of hers. He then went up the stairs that leads to my mom's apartment and climbed into her bathroom window, leaving it wide open. He left with a broken piece of karaoke equipment, her purse and then stole her car. Leaving her front door wide open as he left. 

He drove away in her 2006 Ford Taurus (Blue) around 4:30am according to the security footage. The car has a black sticker on the back of a heavy metal band name from the previous owner. 

Attached are the photos the bar owner was able to pull from the cameras.

"You are 100% right that local elections matter most and I appreciate the interest in my background and what is driving me to want to run (it sure is not the $$).  

I moved to Oakland from Petaluma for a job at a clean energy consulting company in 2012. 3.5 years later I moved to PDX to close the gap on a long distance relationship (and it was worth it, because we are now married). In 2018 my role at the company changed and i was flying back to Oakland or Sac 3-4X per month, so we moved back to Petaluma. Trying to grow the family too. 

Why am I running? The stakes could not be higher for Petaluma in this election. The General Plan update will be overseen by the next CC as will the decision about the future of the fairgrounds. The general plan is a 20 year document, so this election is not about the next 4 years, it is about the next 20. 

In the housing arena, we are on pace to build 816% of our market rate housing goals by 2022 and only projected to hit 65% of our affordable housing goals (and we are only at 15% of affordable housing goals right now, so 65% projection may be high). 

We are showing a $6M deficit next year, meanwhile I've watched the CC give away millions of $$ to developers in fee waivers and direct cash as our streets decay, traffic worsens and and our children and elderly cannot even safely walk down the street.

"Sometimes people vote with their feet. Sometimes people follow jobs and girlfriends.

He isn’t applying for a job as a mechanic. This would be an odd question for a mechanic. No, he’s the kind of man who advocates for green causes, and runs for political office. What are the odds that prior to 2018 that he didn’t notice the politics of his cities?  

The totality of the circumstances make the question legitimate. If he was a screen writer, or an actor, it would be a wildly inappropriate question. 

He lived in Oakland. He said to himself, “Oakland is functioning well, let me move somewhere that’s trying to do this harder.” 

What was his “this” that got him to move?  Was it an active night life scene that drew a ton of millennials from across the country? Or was it a community of like minded people who believe every institution(even trash collection) in the country is guilty of an original sin and is illegitimate?

It’s really not an extreme question. I see many black lives matter posters in the community. Are people just blindly nice? Are we concerned that people will think that a lack of a poster will indicate that black lives don’t matter? Are they indicating that they are members of a Marxist group(would be inappropriate to ask unless they advertise Marxist groups)? Or do they believe that my desire to live with my children and their mother is just some cultural bull shit that is a systemic failure? https://blacklivesmatter.com/what-we-believe/      
     “We disrupt the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and “villages” that collectively care for one another, especially our children, to the degree that mothers, parents, and children are comfortable.”

We know a few things about Cooper to make his disappearance interesting. Your article only mentions Al brought LSD to Europe and called himself Petaluma Al. Anything else? You said he was mentioned in court documents. How was he mentioned in court documents? Did the mentioning of him give us any detail of his actions?

1) what does “initiate dialogue with the school’s leadership about systemic racism at the school.” mean exactly?

-It’s the child raping Catholic Church, and you thought you would just start a conversation about transgressions when they sign your paycheck?

2) Why have I read multiple stories over the years about her being laid off? 
-I barely know who this woman is. I voted for her because I wanted a current parent on the board and for diversity. I would still vote for her for those reasons, but I wouldn’t hire someone if I know I will be interviewed if I fire them.

"My husband and I migrated to Petaluma from Carlsbad (with a few stops in between). Just like you we are not into the party/bar scene and we LOVE it here. The similarities to Carlsbad are numerous: laid back, coastal (Petaluma has river and short drive to ocean), young families, but most of all up and coming! We loved Carlsbad while we were there 10+ years ago. When the development started, we should have bought a home but we weren’t ready and eventually got priced out. We are noticing the same trend happening in Petaluma so I suggest you buy asap. 

Petaluma (all of the North Bay really) thrives on craftsmanship and local pride. Food and beverage are very important! We have local farms, restaurants, breweries, and distilleries that value quality and sustainability. Some of our favorite places are: Wishbone, Wild Goat, Central Market, Green String farms, and Griffo distillery. 

Our favorite activities here include: fishing, hiking, music festivals, kayaking, paddle boarding, and shopping/walking around downtown. There is a little plaza in downtown Petaluma that a lot of locals like to congregate in, you can show up there and start a conversation with all kinds of people (Petalumans tend to be very friendly). The dating scene is good according to my single friends. Art is big here too! We live next to a great artist and have an awesome view of their studio. We also have a few art festivals/events but I’m ashamed to say that I work so much, I haven’t had time to attend one yet. 

Petaluma is a short drive to beautiful and majestic coastline! We love to take day trips out to the coast and we’re always meeting new people out there. We’re also about 45 minutes from SF and all the millions of things you can do there. Napa is another short day trip as well. 

We’ve only been here about two years so I’m sure Petaluma has more to offer that we haven’t discovered yet. If you like Carlsbad then you’ll like Petaluma. I hope you make it out here, best of luck to you!

Edit: you should also know that Petaluma can be divided into two very distinct areas: East & West. They are separated by Hwy 101 and not necessarily the river. East Petaluma tends to be more suburban and has more large chain retailers, it’s also more affordable. West Petaluma includes downtown and the river so it’s a bit more lively and in my opinion better for a younger crowd. The downside is the cost, housing can be up to 20% more expensive than East Petaluma.",t2_5ud2g,Syoma,0,1593287328.0,0,t1_fw72oqg,fw72oqg,True,costcowaterbottle,t3_hgmtov,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petaluma/comments/hgmtov/moving_from_san_diego_to_petaluma/,Moving from San Diego to Petaluma,/r/Petaluma/comments/hgmtov/moving_from_san_diego_to_petaluma/fw72oqg/,8,r/Petaluma,0,8
