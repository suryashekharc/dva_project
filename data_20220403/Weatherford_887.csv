"Weatherford is about 40 miles to Jacksboro, and 20-25 miles into Fort Worth.  It's a fair blend of rural and urban.  Basically the biggest small town in the area.  You've got most the big town stuff in Weatherford, so you don't need to go into DFW unless you want to.

Cost of living relative to where you're coming from is impossible to say, since I don't know where you're coming from in Missouri.  If you compare Weatherford to Kansas City, Missouri, the cola is about 15-20% less, with housing being 28% less in Weatherford.  Pretty big difference, assuming where you live is on par with KC.  [Check this site](https://www.payscale.com/cost-of-living-calculator/Texas-Weatherford) for a general idea of costs vs different areas.

Housing market is slim, because there just aren't a lot of homes on the market at any given time atm.  That said, it's easier to get into a house outside DFW, than inside, due to their being less competition here.  I work in real estate, so that's something I do know a bit about.

HVAC is always in demand down here.  Almost every home and business has central air & heat.  Getting a repair or install in the summer is next to impossible at times.  I don't know what the pay is like, but I would pretty much guarantee a solid job market.

I don't know anything about the school district.  All I can tell you is that the local school district is ranked around 600 of 1900 state schools.  So not top notch, but far from the worst.",t2_5qawg,Eddie_P,0,1647311974.0,0,t1_i0p9dgc,i0p9dgc,True,ContextAshamed2128,t3_tee286,https://www.reddit.com/r/weatherford/comments/tee286/i_am_interested_in_the_area/,I am interested in the area,/r/weatherford/comments/tee286/i_am_interested_in_the_area/i0p9dgc/,2,r/weatherford,0,2

"I talked to a guy at Jack in the Box a couple of weeks ago.  They were running on a 3 person staff, and closing every day at 7, because they only had the staff to be open 12 hours a day.  I noticed the McDonalds drive thru was closed before midnight when I drove past on Saturday, which isn't normal, so I assume they're short staffed as well.

So I agree... don't give the food places any guff for being a little off.  They're working short staffed everywhere atm.

I would recommend NextLink or Rise Broadband if you can't get Spectrum or a cable provider.

"There is plenty to do if you’re not a knob like most of these dingleberries in the comment section. I was born and raised here and I enjoy this town to this day. If you actually enjoy yourself and want to go out and have fun and get creative there’s an endless list of things to do. There’s weatherford lake (with a cool little restaurant/marina that has a patio which holds live music often and is next to a sand volleyball court and plenty of good fishing, a lot of folks go feed the wild life there. Watch out for deer on the lake roads as there is hundreds of them roaming. Sunshine lake is a smaller body of water, great for kayaking or paddle board (they hold paddle board yoga there!) and the sunrise/sunset is 10/10 and the fishing is great. They have a park for kids and picnic areas with tables to grill out and enjoy the outdoors. There’s also soccer fields back there so it’s occasionally pretty packed. The brazos river is a stone throw away where you can get in and float around on a tube and enjoy a cold drink. I’ve done geocaching before and it was fun but not exactly my cup of tea. The film alley has movies, an arcade room, billiards, and bowling with some pretty good food and a full bar. Axe throwing as mentioned in another comment. Multiple bars with dancing and darts and local drinks. A lot of them hold trivia nights and different game nights which are good fun and great way to meet people. Holland lake park is pretty small, but they have a great park for kids with a pavilion and a nice walk way and there’s sports fields nearby. I’ve played there with adult softball leagues, so that’s an option if you enjoy sports. There’s a dog park/kids park by the police station if you have any 4 legged or 2 legged buddies. Across the street from the police station they have the amphitheater at heritage park which holds live music, movie nights on a jumbo screen, all sorts of different events with local food vendors. First Monday is happening right now at the first Monday grounds which is a huge vendor event, there’s people from all over that go there. You can find just about anything if you like to shop. There’s chess clubs, book clubs, dnd, WoW, sports, and any club you could think of. There’s some great gun ranges around. There’s a nice amount of local spots to eat that taste great and have a cool atmosphere. There’s the quanah hill mountain bike trails by the lake which are good fun and challenging. There’s putt putt and go karts and arcade place I think it’s called grand adventures but I’m not certain. I went once and it was a blast. There’s paintball parks and trampoline parks. The Chandor gardens are beautiful and worth a visit (SO to Elizabeth). There’s a hand full of museums. There’s plenty of golf courses around here some top tier and some are budget courses. All sorts of winery events. There’s painting with a twist. There’s plenty of horseback fun to be had, you can get guided rides, trail rides, intro to horseback and pretty much anything equine related. Weatherford is the cutting horse capital of the world! I’ve never been but there’s splash kingdom which is a water amusement park. Plenty of hunting to be done. There’s woodworking classes, dance classes, sewing classes, skydiving, and whatever you enjoy I guarantee someone else enjoys it too. I could go on and on. I feel bad for the person that couldn’t find one fun thing to do in a decent town other than drink copious amounts of liquor, sounds like they find the negative in any setting and too busy being drunk and hungover to go out and enjoy their surroundings.

What do you enjoy to do? That would help us be able to focus in on things you’d probably find cool around here. If you have any questions reach out to me I’ll do my best to answer them.

Also, 99% of the people that hangout at whataburger at night are high schoolers who don’t want to sit at home but no one owns their own place yet so they meet up there. I did the same thing when I was in HS.

I'm south of town so can't say what roads are like but it's probably the simple fact that no one can get there to turn them off? I think the power situation took us all by surprise since we weren't expecting a downed powerlines situation. People didn't think it was necessary to turn them off at the beginning.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

"Weatherford water comes from the lake, and the water plant does a HORRIBLE job at filtering out the algae or seaweed or whatever flavor you want to call it from water.  It goes in cycles, sometimes the water tastes fine, other times it tastes like you're drinking green fish tank water.  And when the water is bad, it's bad everywhere you go that uses tap water... so buying fountain drinks at restaurants will only be a waste of money... always ask for bottled drinks if they're available.  A friend and I contacted the city about the water several years ago, they flatly denied there was anything wrong with it at all... and while I believe them that the water is safe to drink, I certainly don't believe them when they say there's no funky flavor to it.  My friend even sparked the local newspaper to do a story about the water at that time, because it was so bad that time around.

&#x200B;

I recommend you do what most people around here do... buy a water cooler, and a couple of 5 gallon bottles.  There's a reason there are so many water bottle stations all over town.",t2_5qawg,Eddie_P,0,1609529531.0,0,t1_ghr12zy,ghr12zy,True,[deleted],t3_kofw1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/weatherford/comments/kofw1w/water_tastes_funky/,Water Tastes Funky,/r/weatherford/comments/kofw1w/water_tastes_funky/ghr12zy/,3,r/weatherford,0,3

We did a pick up order back in July at the height of the lockdown and no one was wearing a mask inside.  We posted on their Facebook asking about that and they responded generically that they are taking every available precaution including requiring masks.  When we were waiting on our pickup order the staff were running around and one was rude to my wife when she flagged her down to let them know we were there (after waiting about 10 minutes).

If that kids party was there when we walked in we would have just turned around.  Been there done that and not worth the hassle.

"Not trying to split hairs, but when you say *the* airport, which one are you talking about? We have a few around here. To me, *the* airport means DFW, but that is actually quite ways outside of Fort Worth and the commute is probably *at least* an hour. Traffic on 121/183/820 is pretty hellish during rush hour. It usually take me at least 45 minutes to get to the airport with 0 traffic.

If you mean an airport actually in Fort Worth proper, you may be referring to Meacham or Alliance. Heading *towards* Weatherford, that could be closer to 35 on a good day. From Alliance, the stretch of I35W South to 820 would still be pretty bad, but would likely be ok from there.

Definitely take a look at homes here if you're working here. Right now, there's a good chance you will get more bang for your buck compared to fort worth, and there are several great neighborhoods in town. We're getting a lot more in the way of restaurants and retail, but there's still not just a ton to *do* here. We have a movie theater with a bowling alley, a live community theatre (which I think is tragically underrated), a junior college with pretty good basketball and baseball programs, if you're outdoorsy I think we have some decent walking/biking trails, and... that might be about it. We still have to head east for most big entertainment options. Also, this is a *VERY* conservative town, although we do have a small vocal population of liberals.

Supposedly, if you set an intention while searching for a location, you’ll come across whatever it is you’re looking for.

Randonautica is the app that randomly generates location spots not only within a certain radius you allow, but said certain location is similar to what you “envision” or what you set your intention to.
