"* Sycamore Grove (technically Livermore, but not far away at all)
* Sunol Regional Wilderness (try the Little Yosemite hike)
* Mt. Diablo: lots of hikes, and you can even drive to the summit (4,000 feet)
* Pleasanton Ridge / Augustin Bernal Park (as others mentioned)—lots of incline on those two, but if you get to the top of the ridge, it's scenic and it's flat up there. Suggestion to try: there's a little-used ""secret"" entrance that [starts in the town of Sunol and is a slow, steady incline.](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/olive-and-thermalito-trail-loop) It's a fun alternative.

* Mt. Tamalpais (""tam-uhl-PIE-uss"") in Marin County (the other side of the GG bridge) has a boatload of epic trails, and has the distinction of being the place where mountain biking was invented.
* Muir Woods, sure, just make sure you have a reservation or know you can get in, because it can be insane. It's been in movies (e.g. the most recent Planet of the Apes series) and is well-known so it gets crowded.
* Pinnacles National Park, southeast of the Bay Area. This is a new national park (was a mere ""national monument"" up until fairly recently) and isn't well known but is worth the trek. Google it to see the images. There are caves there that are pretty cool to explore.
* Speaking of caves, Black Diamond Mines (an East Bay regional park northeast of here) not only has some nice hiking trails, but also has caves dug during its mining years. Those caves are amazing! You have to either sign up for a tour, *or* go on a day when they're open to the public (which might be all the time,  now, for all I know).
* There's something called Vasco Caves, not far from Livermore, and I would recommend it if I'd ever been there. #Goals

It's worth noting that the East Bay Regional Park system is *the largest regional park system in these United States*. Seriously. It's so big that some of them connect—Mission Peak -> Sunol Regional Wilderness -> Ohlone Regional Wilderness -> Del Valle Regional Park. You can literally hike from Mission Peak all the way to Del Valle, and the trek is long enough that the parks district recommends you *get an overnight camping permit* because most people can't do the whole thing in one day.

No, I've never done it, but I know people who have.

**EDIT**:

If you haven't done Highway 84 drive from Pleasanton to Niles, that's absolutely worth doing—[just not at night.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niles_Canyon_ghost) The town of [Niles was home to Charlie Chaplin](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/the-moment-in-space-and-time-when-charlie-chaplin-became-the-tramp/283716/) for years, and it's where some of the most famous ""little tramp"" movies were filmed, [including this well-known shot.](https://vimeo.com/144071846) The town is cute and now has some decent hipster restaurants as well as Charlie Chaplin museums etc. Worth a vist.

**EDIT2**: If you're on Instagram for Old People (AKA ""Facebook"") there's a really good hiking group, where there's no toxicity (really!) and lots of people posting photos from their hikes. I discover all sorts of places I'd never even heard of that way, and I grew up in NorCal. https://www.facebook.com/groups/681560575346387

Also (I swear, I'll stop!), [Bay Area author Jane Huber](https://www.amazon.com/Jane-Huber/e/B0028EN2UQ) runs [bahiker.com](https://bahiker.com/), which is her compendium of hikes all over the Bay, with reviews and recommendations. She hikes *a lot* so she's got a lot to say about a lot of places. Good resource.

**EDIT3**: all right, all right, I promised I'd stop, and I didn't stop.

The Iron Horse Regional Trail follows the path of a now-defunct railway; it goes from Pleasanton all the way north to Concord. I've done the whole thing (on a bike) and it's pretty amazing, like a hiking/biking highway. Very popular, but big enough that you won't feel like it's over-crowded. https://www.ebparks.org/trails/interpark/iron-horse",t2_279ts,sabat,0,1643564649.0,0,t1_huvlnue,huvlnue,True,Consistent_Seaweed_7,t3_sg5llq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pleasanton/comments/sg5llq/best_places_to_hike_around_dublinpleasanton/,Best places to hike around Dublin/Pleasanton,/r/pleasanton/comments/sg5llq/best_places_to_hike_around_dublinpleasanton/huvlnue/,14,r/pleasanton,0,14
"We hike most weekends. I love the Pleasanton Ridge. The nicest trail head in my opinion as well is the Augustin Bernal entrance through Golden Eagle Estates. Just show the guard your drivers license and tell them you're hiking. Sunol Regional Wilderness is gorgeous. Del Valle is amazing! It's $6 to park but worth every penny Morgan Territory is nice as well. Everywhere is safe and friendly. If you're not from the Bay Area, there are countless places to hike within a 30 minute drive. 

It doesn't seem to take long to get to know people around here. People are pretty friendly and it is a safe area.  I would just start to explore different places. The downtown in Pleasanton is pretty cute. Make sure you get a soft serve at Meadow Lark Dairy.  Livermore has more of a nightlife, but I'm old so I don't know much about that. :) Good luck and welcome to the area!",t2_6g8icfl1,triteandtrifle,0,1643564500.0,0,t1_huvl9t9,huvl9t9,True,Consistent_Seaweed_7,t3_sg5llq,https://www.reddit.com/r/pleasanton/comments/sg5llq/best_places_to_hike_around_dublinpleasanton/,Best places to hike around Dublin/Pleasanton,/r/pleasanton/comments/sg5llq/best_places_to_hike_around_dublinpleasanton/huvl9t9/,5,r/pleasanton,0,5

"Welcome to Pleasanton! It truly *is* a pleasant town. All of the suggestions here are good ones. (Extra props to Mt Diablo—you can drive to the summit!—Sunol Regional Wilderness, and Sycamore Grove.)

The East Bay park system is the largest regional park system in the US. It's huge—so huge that some of them actually connect to each other. (You can literally hike from Mission Peak, near Fremont, straight into Sunol Regional Wilderness, then directly into Ohlone Regional, and on to Del Valle Regional Park. It's a long hike and camping overnight, with a permit, is suggested by the park district. Haven't done this myself, but someday ...)

You've no doubt realized that the SF Bay Area is more than just San Francisco itself. (In fact, SF isn't even the largest city here; that honor goes to San Jose.) The Bay is big, and there's a ton to see here—lots of it is outdoors, so you're definitely going to get a lot of suggestions that involve hiking and walking.

One thing that's worth mentioning: once the weather starts warming up, Pleasanton usually starts closing off Main Street downtown in the evening so people can just mill around, eat outside, etc. It's pretty awesome. We're in for a wet February from what I understand (and *thank god* because we need the rain) but it usually starts warming up by late Feb or early March. In other words, springtime is like a mild, pleasant summer, so there's lots to do, and the weather mostly stays good through November. (I am not going to mention ""fire season"" so as not to tempt fate. No wildfires in the immediate area, but the smoke can blow in.)

BTW, if you have school-age kids, the city does a whole series of camps—generic ones that are really popular, but also computer-themed, and so on. My kid did the main camp for years.

Oh, and do check out the Livermore wineries if you are at all inclined. Some of them are absolutely outstanding, and the vast majority are worth going to. Standouts (IMHO): Fenestra, Ruby Hill and Rubino (sister wineries, technically in Pleasanton), Steven Kent, Mitchell Katz, and Concannon.

"So Pleasanton is absolutely one of the most expensive places in the US you can live and the worst place to have moved if you aren't on at least $150k as a single person. Even $2k a month isn't likely to get you a 1 bedroom apartment. Most start $22-2400. I'm born and raised in Pleasanton, and even I dont live their (nor do 90% of the kids I grew up there) because its so expensive more than 60% of your income goes to rent on something mediocre. That $1400 a month bedroom you saw is what you can expect. 

My reccomendation would be to 

1. Strongly reconsider living in Pleasanton. Its insanely expensive. Look at dublin/Livermore/Tracy/Mountain House depending on where your job is.

"Eh a month late but before the housing tract was built there was a huge pumpkin patch, a real one with the squash still on the (withered dried-up) vine. As a little kid I went and we made a wrong turn on the way back up to Hopyard and wound up on the derelict mansion's driveway. Gates were open, wasn't like a big, long driveway but the house was around the side of a hedge or thicket planted on the road in front. I think there may have been a cornfield or some other agricultural business on the land behind the mansion as the drive in front of the mansion was full of cars and trucks with a lot of farmworkers milling about. The mansion was already boarded up and abandoned looking but to me seemed large and imposing, the archetypical haunted mansion. Always wanted to go in and didn't learn until years after the fact it had burned down. I'm surprised there aren't any pictures of it on-line. Like the poster below, I may conflating its appearance with something I saw in a movie (possibly Burnt Offerings, filmed at the Dunsmuir mansion in Oakland) but I want to say it had two-story columns in front, maybe a second-story porch or balcony?

Diablo Regional Trail](https://www.ebparks.org/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?blobid=24166).  Leave your bike at Hap Magee Ranch Park.  Continue on the Las Trampas to Mt.

"How about a no-car Mt Diablo Summit hike that starts and ends at BART stations?  Will that do?

My candidate for the greatest BARTable hike in the Bay Area is Pleasant Hill BART to Walnut Creek BART via the summit of Mount Diablo.  It's approximately 30 miles from end to end, and less than 2 miles of that is city streets and sidewalks.  (Most is dirt trail, but there are some sections of paved trail / bike path.)  I've done the whole thing in both directions (although not in recent years and not all on the same day), so I know that, at least in the past, it was good trail the entire way.  There are lots of options for short-cuts to make a shorter hike if you don't mind skipping the summit.

Many of those unmarked trails in the area are on steep slopes with loose dirt; slipping, falling, and suffering an immobilizing and disorienting injury could easily happen. Likewise, heat stroke is a very severe condition (immediate medical attention is needed, it’s not just being thirsty after not drinking enough on a hot day) and loss of consciousness is a common symptom. Getting injured and disoriented could very easy put someone in the same situation that Philip suffered.",t2_cxifh,mark2000stephenson,0,1628173750.0,0,t1_h7t7xui,h7t7xui,True,spankyourkopita,t3_oycarf,https://www.reddit.com/r/pleasanton/comments/oycarf/anyone_else_familiar_with_moller_ranch_trail_its/,Anyone else familiar with Moller Ranch Trail?

"If you're going to Santa Cruz (which is the only beach worth going to), leave in early morning and you'll be fine (ie 1-1.5 hours).  If you don't leave until 10 or 11, it'll be 2-2.5 hours, most of the delta being spent on 17.

The closest ski hill by distance is Sierra at Tahoe (mostly a beginner's hill) with Kirkwood (mostly advanced) and then South Lake Tahoe not much further.  50 is also less crowded and more pleasant drive than 80   (but is single lane each way).  Either way you're driving through downtown Sacramento, so traffic can be tough.  Livermore to Tracy is also a complete s**tshow during rush hour.   If you avoid rush hours (both Bay Area's and Sacramento's)  you can make it in 3.5-4 hours. 

There is actually a ski bus that picks you up in Livermore at ~5:30AM and will drop you at a variety of ski hills 9 or 10-ish.

I personally recommend anything along Bernal between Sunol and Vineyard (Vintage Hills, Kottinger Ranch, etc) or anything in the area boxed by Las Positas, Santa Rita, 680, and the Fairgrounds (Del Prado, Sports Park, etc).  In particular both the Sports Park and downtown would be easily accessible from these neighborhoods.

Probably the most sought after “normal” neighborhoods. There are more expensive neighborhoods and fancy newer ones but most of them don’t have the any sense of community.  

A lot of Pleasanton is in transition. The rising home values for decades have both attracted people and been incentive for people to cash out and leave.

"I second the estimate of 1hr going and 1.5 hrs returning.  I work in Cupertino and this i roughly the same timeline (and MV and Cupertino are roughly equivalent travel times, from a commuting perspective).  The reason for this is that 680 over the Sunol grade has a HOV lane on the southbound direction, but the northbound direction's HOV lane is still under construction (ETA 2020).  So there is one fewer lanes in the Northbound direction at the most congested point. 

There are 2 main choke points on the commute to MV - 680 over the Sunol grade, and 237 from 880 to 101.  Each are guaranteed to be bumper-to-bumper on any given weekday.  Each of these stretches has an HOV lane (subject to the construction that I mentioned above), which are almost as congested as the other lanes during prime rush hour but provide a tangible benefit  if you're traveling on the fringes of rush hour (before 4:30 or after 6). 

I moved to Pleasanton in a similar situation as you - my wife worked in Walnut Creek, and me in Cupertino.   While I don't exactly enjoy the commute, I do think Pleasanton is the best location for me.  It's am amazing city for kids in the age range you mention, and is still quite affordable as compared to the comparable areas in Santa Clara county.  We made the decision that one parent should be close to home, to respond to emergencies / child-related issues, so trying to split the commute 50/50 between parents wasn't a good idea.  San Ramon and Livermore are each a little more affordable than Pleasanton, but you'd have to add another 15 mins each direction for your commute.   

Beyond a FasTrak (which is just a transponder for paying for toll booths), I highly recommend getting an electric vehicle, then applying for an HOV pass (see https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/dmv/detail/vr/decal).  It will take about 60 days from the time you get the EV, but then you'll be allowed to take the HOV lanes even if you're driving on your own. That will cut ~10 mins off each direction (though you'll need the NB lane on 680 to open before you realize full benefits).  This is the open secret of why EVs are so popular in California. You can also pay to drive in the HOV lane on 680 and part of 237, but it's expensive (~$8 per trip per section, i.e. $8 for 680 then another $8 for 237, then the same fees on the way home)

I find the ACE train to be pleasant and reliable; however you need to have the sort of job where you can walk out at exactly the same time every day (Fred Flintstone style), which I find to be generally incompatible with Silicon Valley working culture.  I wish I could take the train more often. If you can make it work, good for you.

"Your commute time will probably average an hour or so in the morning, and an hour and a half on the way home. Depending on distance from freeway on city streets of course, and what part of Pleasanton you move to. If you're gonna drive you need to get yourself a fast track. Even when they are not super fast the toll lanes do save a significant amount of time. (And if you place a value on being at home you will come out ahead)

"There are multiple ways to answer this.

If the emphasis is on *nearby*, then I would recommend driving up [Del Valle Road](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Del+Valle+Rd+%26+Mendenhall+Rd,+Livermore,+CA+94550/@37.6045924,-121.6876915,19z) and stopping just past Mendenhall Road.  The police or Del Valle park rangers might check up on you, but if you tell them you are stargazing from the road, and especially if you have binoculars and/or a telescope with you, I've found them to be pretty chill.

If the emphasis is on *dark*, check out the [Dark Sky Finder](http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/).  From Pleasanton, for fairly dark skies, take the Mines Road south from Livermore.  For truly dark skies, your best bet from Pleasanton might be to hop on I-5 and head south.

"AT&T is bad in a lot of places. Example: I work at a major corporation with HQ on the Embarcadero. A few years ago, when AT&T was the only choice if you had an iPhone, the CEO of said company was so tired of his calls dropping *in downtown San Francisco* that he used his clout to reach the CEO of AT&T. A month later, an AT&T cell tower appeared on top of our building.

Even after that, I still had calls drop frequently when I was in that building. (I am not that CEO, but I did and do have an iPhone.)

Then, Apple opened up iPhones to other carriers. I went with Verizon because they've spent a lot on building out their network, far more than AT&T has. Once in a while, I may get a bad connection or a dropped call, but it's rare.

AT&T is bad, and it should feel bad. [I would not bother waiting](http://i.imgur.com/O7veYes.jpg) for that company to improve its coverage.

"It's funny, growing up in Pleasanton I always felt like Dublin was older and run down (I'm in my late 20s so high school was a while ago).  They've done so much recently to improve the city it's insane.  It's quickly becoming one of the most desirable places to live in the Bay Area.  [They are breaking ground on a $33MM waterpark soon.](http://www.contracostatimes.com/my-town/ci_27458438/dublin-set-break-ground-33-million-water-park)  They are about to open up a brand new [shopping center](http://www.regencycenters.com/) right in the area I was talking about.  They've opened a couple a tap rooms in the area.  You're an exit away from a brand new outlet mall in Livermore.  You're within a couple miles of several nice golf courses.

Needless to say I really like living here.  You couldn't be closer to Pleasanton for work.  You're a couple exits away from Livermore which has a younger downtown with bars, a thriving wine country, and some really cool breweries.  You can walk to BART and be in Oakland or SF in 30-45 minutes.

Again, I don't know what you're looking for or what appeals to you.  I also went to college down south and when I moved back I felt like Dublin gave me access to what I wanted.

"Wow so I haven't looked for a place in a couple of years and the prices have gone up quite a bit.  I know people that live at [Waterford](http://www.apartments.com/waterford-place-apartment-dublin-ca/s0fptk4/) and the rooms there are somewhat in your range.  They are right next to/above a nice shopping center, half mile away from the movie theatre/restaurants, close to BART, and they are putting in a bunch of other brand new things in the area.  It's really nice.

I was thinking of [Avalon](http://www.avaloncommunities.com/california/dublin-apartments/avalon-dublin-station) but it looks like those got crazy expensive.

[Avana](http://www.apartments.com/avana-dublin-station-dublin-ca/0wxjps1/) are newer, in an up and coming area.

In Pleasanton I had a friend that lived at [Pleasanton Place](http://www.esring.com/pleasanton-place/) and he paid $1,400 for a 1 bedroom.  This was a couple of years ago and they've been recently renovated, but might be worth looking into.

[I looked at these in Pleasanton](http://www.braddockandlogan-apts.com/apartments-for-rent/california/pleasanton/civic-square/online-leasing) and they were definitely newer than most other places, but still pretty expensive.

"I'm going to throw out a dissenting opinion here. Yes, Pleasanton is very expensive, but in my opinion the addition of commute time can detract from any savings very fast. I'd say to minimize the commute, stick with Livermore or Dublin.

There are a couple of cheap apartment complexes near the intersection of Murietta Drive and Stanley Boulevard in Livermore that are only about 10 minutes from Pleasanton, but traffic can get very bad on Stanley in the morning. I don't know Dublin well.

I have a co-worker who lives in Archstone Apartments in Pleasanton that she's very happy with. Not sure how much she's paying in rent but it's nice, well-run and very convenient (walking distance to BART and Wal-Mart). 

No matter how cheap it is, do not under any circumstances move in to Springhouse Commons on Stoneridge Drive.

"You're not going to be able to find much in Pleasanton for less than that unless you can find a roommate to split a two bedroom.

Honestly, Dublin has some brand new places near BART that you can get for the same price as something in Pleasanton.  Your commute would be very similar to actually living in Pleasanton and you'd be near more stuff.  Livermore is also an option but a little harder to get to Pleasanton in the morning and it's typically a little older.  San Ramon is a little bit cheaper and not too far away.

"Sunnyvale is too far in my opinion. You will have a reverse commute but still too far and will just expend time, effort, gas money. Slightly cheaper are the cities of Dublin and Livermore and they are just next to Pleasanton. I assume you have a car? A little farther up and more affordable (though not as nice) is Hayward or San Leandro and the commute wouldn't be so bad. Fremont is a little farther but still reasonable. Or generally speaking, at least find a room on the ""East (side of the) Bay"" as Sunnyvale and it's surrounding cities are on the 'other' side and will make commuting longer/harder (You would have to cross a bridge and pay tolls.).

"Pleasanton has quite a few racists.  Most of them are covertly racist.  I'm sure you can meet a few of them at the grocery stores.  Watch them get super friendly with a white customer.  When it's your turn at the checkstand, you'll get a very forced, ""Hi, find everything OK?""

That's OK, though.  Many of them are gradually being forced to move away because they can't afford to continue their false luxurious lifestyle (nice cars leased, nice clothes, accessories all bought with credit cards, etc).

I know a lot of them can't stand me because I speak to them as if I'm one of them.  ""Hey, Susan how are you?  That's some crazy weather we've been having lately, isn't it?""

I'm just waiting for one of them to say something racist to my face so I can tell them that their hope of keeping ""their"" town ""white"" is futile because we Asians have a ton of kids so we're going to outnumber them in a few years.  Plus we also give our kids all of our time and resources to do well in school so they'll grow up to have a ton of kids also.  

This is what we talk about at our secret Asian meetings.  Haven't you heard?  We're going to learn your language better than you.  You're going to thrive.  So you spend all your time focused on hating us while we spend ours pushing our people forward.

I would also remind them that they have other Asians (Indians) to deal with.  That group's population in this city has also been growing year over year.

To these racists, I say abandon all hope.  There's nothing you can do to stop the tide.
