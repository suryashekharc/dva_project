"2 bedroom apartments are between $780 and $2400 depending on location. Figure around $1300 average for a nice place.

Electric is like $0.17 a kwh. Check national grids website for more info.

Water is super cheap but that depends on where you live. I pay a water bill every 6 months which is about $42 for up to 30,000 gallons and then like $0.02 a gallon if I go over that. I'm sure it can be more expensive if you are on a non-municipal water service.

Gas is around $4.10 a gallon.

Food prices vary greatly based on where you shop. Avoid price chopper / market 32 to save money. Decent bread is like $2.50 a loaf. Milk is $3.40 a gallon. Ground beef is around $4 a pound, chicken and pork range between $1 to $4 a pound depending on cut. Rotisserie chickens are like $6. Bananas are $0.60 a pound and apples are around $1.80 a pound.

"Ooh my time to shine. We were there for more than 2 years(2018-2020) and absolutely loved it. Feel free to ask any questions. Only reason we moved was because interest rates were so low and we were lucky enough to find a house in Latham. Mortgage came out to the same as our rent.

What is the cost now? It was excellent when we were there, $1100 for a single bedroom and $200 more for the 2 Bedroom.

It‚Äôs fantastic, there is always parking available and they are very diligent about keeping it clear and clean. There is also free EV charging which is a massive saving if you have an electric/hybrid car.

Well make sure you get one closer to the school then, the ones near the main road are right across from the fire station and you will notice it for the first few weeks. You do learn to tune it out though.

Richard, the main super, is incredible and runs an amazing team. Anytime we had an issue they were on  the ball and even showed up on weekends. Best experience we could have had as renters.

The management was always ready to help in any way and the rent payment portal was super easy to use and set up. Nothing shady at all in our few years there.

The laundry and the elevators are also brand new, however the elevators are a little bit slow to close. Management told me it was to cater to the safety of older people who live in the building.

1 Bed is a perfect size. 2 Bedroom is incredibly spacious and would be my pick if you have somebody living with you.


Avoid the ground floors. From what the super told us, people flush all sorts of garbage including masks down the toilet and that backs the downstairs toilets up. They used to have monthly water shutdowns for about 2-3 hours to clear it up.

Certain judges have time built into their schedule as part of their actual scheduled hours for performing marriages.  The number of spaces are very limited, not necessarily convenient, require advance booking, and are free. 

The rest may do it outside of THEIR schedule, which is very likely not 9-5 M-F.  For a town judge this may be 2-3 hours per week.   If you want to use their services on their time off, they will want to be compensated.

"You won't get married by a county judge unless you know them or something. They are busy with serious cases like murders, family court cases, and other shit. You get married by a City or Town judge.

Get with the program.  

**EDIT:**  Furthermore.... a county judge actually has to know the law and have legal credentials because people stand before a County judge defending themselves against actual criminal cases.   They work a full day, it is not a part time gig.  This is why they make the six figure salary you pointed out and this is also why your point is irrelevant.  

A town/city judge is part time and does not require legal credentials. They handle simple violations and small misdemeanors where any asswipe, even a high school dropout, can run for town or city judge and hold the office on condition of passing a *weeklong* NYS magistrate class.

Finally, officiating a wedding is not a obligation of the bench, just a power.  Any county court judge or their personal clerk will decline unless they know you or have some kind of connection to you.   They simply don't have the time unless they do it on their own personal time - and LOL, you should tip them for that....  Remember, people have the right to a speedy trial, there is always a backlog of real cases before county courts.   Just ask any friend going through a custody battle.

"I've considered it. I own a home in the Delaware/2nd Ave no-mans land. I bought a new house and moved out and it's mostly been sitting vacant as I do work on it and get it ready for whatever's next. My mortgage is $780. My assumption is that it (3 bed, 2 bath, yard, washer/dryer) can be rented in the neighborhood of $1,400 to $1,500. Say $600 a month in ""profit"" over the mortgage, $7,200 a year. A conservative yearly estimate of repairs/maintenance is 1.5x your monthly rent so that's $2,100 subtracted from $7,200 for a yearly income of $5,100. 

The house as it sits now would give me about $50,000 over what I owe on it. So it would take somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 years renting it to make the same amount I could selling it. In those 10 years of renting it would likely need more extensive repairs, so I'd say it's probably more like 12 or 13 years renting it to make what I could selling it as it sits now.

"I absolutely know how parking permits work as ive lived in much bigger cities than Albany! I think what most center square residents dont understand is that when you live near downtown in any other city in America, you pay big bucks to park you car right next your place, as just about every cities residents only parking is usually out of the way from from the major business and shoping hubs. Everyone who lives in a major downtown or buisness area feeds the meter regardless of residence status in those areas because the parking is meant for people who are shopping, visiting, or working.

So if your so concerned about people stealing what you think is your god given right to park within a few blocks of your place, then make everyone pay everywhere that's close to downtown from 6 am - 7pm,  just like every other city in the US does. Or an even better idea is to get rid of the parking spots all together and give them back to residents in the form of bike lanes, bigger sidewalks, or bus lanes on more major streets.

"While you‚Äôre right in the short term, in the long term the math on building cities for universal car use doesn‚Äôt work out beyond few years. It‚Äôs really incredibly expensive, regardless of location, and could be used in ways that actually increase the cities economic base while costing less at the same time.

Just take two or three streets and remove the parking. Imagine Lark street if you could walk down it calmly, without revving engines going by, and eat on a shady tree lined peaceful pedestrian street a 5 minute walk from the Capitol and right next to Central Square. Plenty of customers to support it, and out of towners can park one block over if they really need to.

The fact is, when this is tried elsewhere, even in small cities like Ithaca, it‚Äôs a huge boon for business and the city. The math doesn‚Äôt lie and it just doesn‚Äôt work for how much we build around cars. 

Imagine if all those parking garages were buildings where people worked, lived, played (and paid taxes!!). Instead they‚Äôre garages that cost $50,000 per spot to build, and need extensive (and expensive) maintenance on a regular basis. For exactly zero direct tax benefit. We really need to start moving that direction now to help keep our city thriving and solvent for the next 20 years

Also, we have so many homeless people. Wouldn‚Äôt more affordable housing be useful? Taking away some street parking on one street can‚Äôt fix that, but replacing some parking garages with apartment buildings would

"The point is that when I lived in Cambridge, I didn't need a car. Boston has very few resident only parking areas and its only enforced mon-fri 8am to 6pm. if  the majority of people who rented in Boston/Cambridge/Summerville had a car, like most people in Albany do, you would have the same problem that you have in central square right now but most Boston residents either dont have a car, park their car in a garage that they have to take public transit to get to (gasp), or park it at a family members house in the suburbs and take the commuter rail to pick it up when they need it. Boston has a lot of parking garages, they just aren't visable from the skyline because they are either underground or behind a skyscraper.

While I understand the frustration of not finding parking right on your street, the issue is that everyone in Albany is car dependent because there isnt good public transit or biking infrastructure. living in most cities means that your car isn't going to be close to your place unless it has off street parking and it's unreasonable to ask everyone who doesn't live there not to park there at any time.

"No.  I‚Äôd never suggest anyone wants to be homeless aside from people that chose #vanlife or other nomadic kinds of lifestyles.

I wish it would be so simple to solve homelessness by just providing them with housing so they can get back on their feet.  

Giving a person with untreated bipolar disorder a house is great.  But if they are not given the care to manage their illness, they are no closer to becoming a functioning adult.

"They do the same thing when turning left.  The street behind my mother's house (more of an alley, but it's signed Avenue A) is a one-way that ends at a stop sign, where you have to turn right or left.  ***Every time without fail*** cars turning left move to the far right at the intersection!

Most of the time I just want to turn right, but because there's a traffic light to the left and nobody on that street leaves space for anyone coming out of Ave A, people get stuck waiting to make their left.  And I'm stuck waiting behind them because they had to pull to the right to make a left.  There's also a train crossing in that direction that backs up traffic going that way.  Once or twice I got so aggravated waiting, that I went around them on the left to cross in front of them making my right, and of course got dirty looks.

And when I actually need to turn left and get behind these people, I will pull up behind where they should have been to try to make the point that this is where they should have been.  Just the other day I was in the car with my brother, following behind a pickup.  He pulls to the right but doesn't have a blinker on, and I assume he's turning right, so I pull up on his left with my left blinker on.  Then he decides to put on his left blinker, and my brother informs me that he's shooting us death stares.  Frist break in traffic and he guns it to get out in front of us.  

Not that I would have tried getting out in front front of him once I saw his front blinker turn on.  These people always feel they have the right of way, even when they are in the wrong lane for a left turn.  I wouldn't have even pulled up alongside him if he had had the left directional on.

"In 2012 the city of Albany established a cabaret license which limited the ability for venues to operate within the city of Albany if they had entertainment, ranging from a jukebox to live bands and everything in between. It was (is) used by the city to dish out violations if venues didn‚Äôt operate the way the city wants. I used to work EDM and throwback events at the Fuze Box and we had to be very careful not to be too loud, because people would file noise complaints that would halt our events. 

Here is an article about how it was negatively impacting the city: http://alloveralbany.com/archive/2012/02/07/comedy-karaoke-and-albanys-cabaret-law

At least with a line system you‚Äôll have a fixed amount of parking spaces- which can be more intentionally allocated to residents. My point is- would you rather have a fixed 5-6 spaces less per block or potentially lose 5-10 spots lost to bad parking?

"No. Just stop. You really, REALLY, clearly don't know what the fuck you're talking about.  Pitting a bike would 100% inflict more serious injury as it would result in a lateral sheer impact of the subject flying off the bike and whipping into the asphault.  In the collision we see, a significant amount of the force was taken up by the bikes suspension prior to the subject falling off the bike.

If the cop had hit him sideways there is no way he would have gotten up and fled off. Not going to happen.  If the cop had actually intended to injure or kill the biker this would have been the way to do it. But that's not what happened. So let's review what actually did happen:

The dirt biker brake checked the cop. This brought him too close to the cop.

The cop slowed down in response to this and was starting to open up some distance.

The dirt biker held the now slower speed for a moment, then began to accelerate lightly. 

The cop also stopped decellerating and began to accelerate in response the dirtbikers acceleration.

The dirtbiker again hit the brakes.

The police car was already accelerating and the combined force of that acceleration, the reduced distance because of the initial brake check, and the newly added braking force of the dirtbike caused the dirtbiker to get hit.

The cop didn't RaM hIm!

I'm of the opinion that people who live in cities \*shouldn't have cars all together\* (but we need better public transport). IF ANYTHING, parking spaces should be mostly for commuters.

Many people live in Albany because they work in the city. If they are not required to work in the city, they would leave for a cheaper, nicer area. Which would hurt the scene.

Human beings are not entitled to free parking. Free parking is not an inalienable human right enshrined into the constitution. The fact that Saratoga subsidizes public parking and uses it's police to shut down protests pointing out that the city does not have an ADA compliant sidewalk system says a lot about where they decide to spend their taxpayers dollar. Paying for the use of space to store private property is a well understood concept.

"If you have a vacant lot and choose to build a parking lot or garage you lose that space for homes, offices, stores, etc. That lot now generates relatively little tax revenue or commerce for local businesses. Cities in general in the US didn't build around cars before the 50s-ish because not everyone had cars back then. Albanys population was actually higher 100 years ago than now. The only way to get back to that, and improve further, is to make the city a better place to live. Generally this means improving transit (yes rail! Please!) and walkability and not centering development around cars.

You can see that kind of people centered development in a lot of European cities the last few decades. NYC and Boston to some extent too.

I have no issues with students parking places, obviously having a car is their right, but its the fact that they can park places normal residents cant in a place thats not even near their college that annoys me. I was a UAlbany student myself and though I easily got through my whole degree without owning a car, it still annoys me that all these kids have cars they barely use and can park places we can't for days on end with no repercussions.

I know that they barely use their cars because when it snows a lot, you'll see some buried cars parked in the same student spot for days on end, implying that they just don't even need them/use them often.",t2_7wmpm,skyburnsred,0,1648739614.0,0,t1_i2uugtf,i2uugtf,False,ChickenPartz,t3_tszyf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albany/comments/tszyf8/albany_wants_commuters_out_of_residential_parking/,Albany wants commuters out of residential parking spaces,/r/Albany/comments/tszyf8/albany_wants_commuters_out_of_residential_parking/i2uugtf/,1,r/Albany,0,1

Thus, students who live downtown would not be able to park in that lot overnight. Could be part of the problem. 

Although, an easy solution for that specifically would UA allowing commuters to park overnight since we all pay the same for a parking pass lol.
