"I don't think anyone can seriously argue that the segregation in most American cities, including Boston, wasn't the result of pervasive systemic and individualized racism. That said, it's a leap to conclude that any individual family's choice to leave Boston, even if driven primarily by the choice to avoid busing, was driven substantially or even at all by racial animus. After all, busing sucked for many of the students involved, especially the white students, who, like the black students, were frequently involuntarily transferred from neighborhood schools where they had developed friend groups and had ties to the community to schools substantially distant -- sometimes a half hour bus ride instead of a 5 or 10 minute walk -- but who, unlike the black students, were largely being transferred to poorer schools, with worse academic outcomes, worse facilities, and worse teachers. You don't need to be racist to decide that it's not a good thing for your kids to go through that.

And we also know that ultimately, busing was an overly heavy-handed strategy that arguably made the problem worse.

"As an outsider I’ll give my restaurant takes. 

It was nice being in a major city and not seeing it infested with hipster types. No gimmicky way over priced food trucks. I just kind of wandered and couldn’t tell you where I was. I also had a 60lb backpack on and was alone so that really influenced my dining choices. 

I found a little family owned sushi joint - not fancy at all and threw down. I was coming off the Appalachian Trail and starving. It was glorious. My only bad experience was going in to a little bar. It didn’t seem exceptionally “locals only” type place. I should add… I had a hotel room at this point so was freshly showered/groomed and backpack free. I knocked over my glass on my second beer and it was like I stomped a puppy to death in the middle of the place. It was absolutely bizarre. I meekly finished my beer, offered to pay for the broken glass and asked for another beer.  Bartender said no, I didn’t need to pay for the glass but I should leave. I was alone, definitely not causing a scene (aside from knocking over my glass) and being probably overly nice.

Of course, the MTA is far superior to the T, for sure.

"Pizza Stop in Brookline and Garden Pizza out in Milford are my personal favorites. Kendall House of Pizza in Kendall Square is good if you get one made fresh, but they’re so busy (usually for lunch) that they make a bunch ahead of time for slices and let them sit under a heat lamp and those don’t stay well because of the thicker crust. My grandfather founded Angelo’s House of Pizza in Waltham, my dad took him there shortly before he passed and he reported the pizza under the current owners was great.

"Magic is already happening. The value being captured by the broker is an order of magnitude greater than the value they are actually creating by posting a listing online, exchanging emails, and unlocking a door.

Can landlords perform this magic? Suppose a landlord could pay the broker themselves and raise the rent by 8% (as you already believe). After raising rent by 8%, couldn't they then find a cheaper broker and pocket the difference? After all, it's the property that's scarce. 

The reason this *doesn't* happen has less to do with the level of service being provided by brokers, and more to do with their ""magical"" ability to extract value from tenants directly.

Why is this such a bad thing for brokers? It's not. They have a great scam going. Mugging people is great for muggers. And people are willing to pay muggers!

"Nearly all the pizza places in Worcester were Greek for a long time. Many of them have been sold, especially to incoming Brazilian and Egyptian families, in the last 20 years.

"I heard more or less the same opinion by an acquaintance (that some of the dirt bike incidents that have happened lately would not have happened if there was a public dirt bike park somewhere local) and I think that’s a silly and disingenuous position to take. Admittedly, it is kind of arbitrary what hobbies municipalities opt to subsidize by constructing public infrastructure to support it - basketball courts and baseball fields being frequently constructed with taxpayer funds - but still, dirt biking is pretty niche, no? Can we at least agree on that? Probably a higher risk of serious injury than basketball or other activities which then disincentives governments concerned with safety to invest in construction of parks that might encourage an activity they deem risky. Furthermore, can we at least suspect, without necessarily villainizing the people who ride around with their friends on dirt bikes in the streets, that at least part of the likely allure for them is the mischievous element to the whole thing? Thus, building a dirt bike park with taxpayer money doesn’t necessarily satiate the dirt biker’s real desires on how they want to use them. 

Not bashing Wu as I have no idea what she’s said about this in the past, if anything. Just my reaction to the proposition that the construction of a public dirt bike park would have some sort of ameliorating effect on the altercations between dirt bike riders and drivers or others. Also, this is not meant as a response to this video or assigning blame in this case to the dirt bikers over and above the driver.",t2_mwljahl,SmellerOfFineSmells,0,1649001920.0,0,t1_i38j93v,i38j93v,False,FuriousAlbino,t3_tuxftq,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/tuxftq/meanwhile_in_dorchester/,Meanwhile in Dorchester..,/r/boston/comments/tuxftq/meanwhile_in_dorchester/i38j93v/,1,r/boston,0,1

It's full of similar people pretending they live in a big city or people who have never lived anywhere else and will die thinking this is the greatest place they could live.

"I grew up on the oversize frosted gingerbread men (which in my household we now call ""Frosting Bombs."" But IMO, they should still come in regulation uniform. Back in the day, they were always frosted as clowns with a little pressed-sugar clown face. Recently I went and the whole thing had blue frosting on it decorated with little plastic fish. Like, there wasn't even a face. Disturbing! If it's person-shaped, pls frost it as a person, thanks MB.

"My partner moved from Minneapolis to Boston - while the winters are way colder in Minneapolis, he really loathes Boston winters for being so wet and messy. In MN it hardly ever gets above freezing during the winter so you just have nice dry snow everywhere (most of the time).
