"I’ve been to Hawaii ten times over the last 30 years. I’ll go back again. I’ve been to Sanibel twice and I’m returning in December of this year. I enjoy them both tremendously. They are really both wonderful and yet different experiences. To me, Sanibel feels completely safe, comfortable and laid back. Hawaii is safe for the most part, but I’ve gotten some negative, unwelcoming responses from some of the local residents there a very few times, usually around beaches. But that’s really rare. Mostly folks are very friendly and helpful. Also, there’s some petty theft and homeless issues there that can be pretty weird around some beaches. Hawaii offers much more diverse natural resources and some of the most amazing tropical scenery that the world has to offer. The ocean can be really wild and dangerous in Hawaii, so you really have to pay attention to what’s going on there. Some areas, like the Kaanapali coast and Kihei on Maui are overdeveloped beach areas with huge hotels and condos. If you do go to Hawaii, make sure a week in Kauai is on your itinerary, you absolutely won’t regret it.",t2_b0uov,Spudtater,0,1648263062.0,0,t1_i25dwk3,i25dwk3,False,RickSteve-O,t3_seeroq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/seeroq/some_say_sanibel_is_better_than_hawaii/,Some say Sanibel is better than Hawaii…,/r/Sanibel/comments/seeroq/some_say_sanibel_is_better_than_hawaii/i25dwk3/,1,r/Sanibel,0,1

"If I remember correctly there is a group of condos/apartments in that area.

Good advice already so I’ll just add that my wife and I rented a condo in the fall for a week and worked remotely. She did telehealth so on camera all day.

"Here are my thoughts and I’m sure you will get a lot more good advice.  If you are interested in coming to Sanibel for 2023 I’d start looking right now and don’t wait too long.  While January may be a little quiet at the beginning of the month it starts to get very busy by the end.  February is considered high season, so you won’t get any bargains at all.  Be prepared to pay at least $1,700.00 a week and that does not include fees from rental companies.  You might get away with some slightly less in early January.  Also rental companies will charge extra for dogs and some owners will have a size limit.  Have you thought about December? Prices are lower weather is beautiful and the island is less crowded.  There are many good rental companies on the island, kingfisher vacations, royal shell to name a few.  You can also try VRBO to get a feel for prices.  If you want to be close to the beach expect to pay the price.  Good luck Sanibel is beautiful and a month there is magical.  FYI I own a cottage on the island and I’m already rented for high season for 2023!",t2_14f12ihr,giovanna8486,0,1646438169.0,0,t1_hzdwhpf,hzdwhpf,True,justplainmeni,t3_t6v7hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/t6v7hl/monthly_rentals_for_offseason/,Monthly Rentals for Off-season?,/r/Sanibel/comments/t6v7hl/monthly_rentals_for_offseason/hzdwhpf/,8,r/Sanibel,0,8

"It depends on which beaches you frequent in Hawaii. I lived on Oahu, and if you’re looking to boogie board or surf, steer clear of Honolulu.  Obviously the famous North Shore is a decent place and only if you’re experienced.  Honolulu is a tourist trap — especially Waikiki.  Residents use driver’s licenses for kama‘aina (local) discounts.  The surf fluctuates depending on beach location and time of year. On the other hand, Sanibel beaches are calm and peaceful.  And who can complain about beach combing there!  You can snorkel both places.  Hawaii is a bit rougher (depending on location) with lots to see. Sanibel is calm and doesn’t offer as much visually. I’d suggest young parents introduce the beach to children on Sanibel simply because it would be safer and there are tons of shells.

Around SEFL/Miami Metro you can catch them, but it is normally way slimmer pickings then the keys- also typically involves scuba in deeper water.

I bet you might end up seeing more blue and stone crabs then lobster.

"You need a car- sanibel is not really walkable as most places you stay are on the beach and most places you eat are on the main road.

ALSO, if you are staying at a hotel, many of them will give you status like the water is closed but the beach is ok or both are closed.

"Blind pass during tide changes (but not during slack tide).  I found that about an hour or two after the incoming tide seemed best.  The bite could sometimes be fairly short, about an hour, but you'd almost always get a snook.  

You ideally want to position yourself down current of thr bridge and toss your bait in the eddies that form behind the pillars.  

If those spots are occupied (almost always), on an incoming tide, walk the beach along the mangroves north.  There are hidden trails all over that area.  My favorite spot was maybe 40' north from where the beach narrows.

On an outgoing tide, I caught fish from both the sanibel and captiva sides.  

- The beach on the sanibel side directly next to the bridge.  

- On thr captiva side, literally anywhere both north and south of thr Bridge.  North of thr Bridge is a rocky wall that you need to stand on, but I've seen a lot of fish there.  A local was standing about halfway up the shore south of thr Bridge on the jetty banging Jack's and snook nearly every cast targeting a current rip that forms about 8 feet or so off the shoreline.  He was using a mirrolure about 3"", that had a greenback color pattern.  But he was frequently changing lures before he honed in on that lure.  Need a stiff rod, heavy ish leader and really pay attention to figuring out what twitch pattern is working at that particular moment.  Just changing your pattern can make you go from catching no fish to catching one every every cast.

- at thr point of the jetty, I saw a 30""+ snook caught right at dusk on a cast netted green back.

The local was using braided line, think it was relatively light, maybe 20lb braid, and always always use a 30lb fluorocarbon leader.  I had about 10 breakoffs, usually on hooksets, until I changed to a 30lb leader.

Lures varied.  You really need to figure out what they are in the mood for at a particular moment. Every lure I'm going to mention is stuff you can find locally at the two bait shops. Storm 4"" white swim baits caught me a lot of fish.  Gulp shrimp, bounced off the bottom, had their moments.  I heard gold kastmasters were popular, but disnt fish them much.  If you fish mangroves, tossing weed less slug go style plastic twitch baits was popular for snook and redfish.  Of course live bait is usually the way you want to go, live shrimp is thr most popular but I saw some guys really nailing snook on pinkish.  If you buy/have a castnet, Greenbacks are everywhere and a very productive bait.  They say whatever you castnet on the beach is going to be close to the ideal bait.  Directly across the street is a place called castaways that has live shrimp and a small selection of tackle.  The quality of the shrimp varied, and you usually had to be there early.  The other tackle shops were more consistent.

Depending on the length of your stay, how often you plan on going to the beach, how busy sanibel is, and how much patience you have, you may want to consider buying a year long parking pass, like I did.  Not cheap, was over $200, but worth every penny once you realize the parking nightmare that exists on that island.  They have reserved spots that only permit holders are allowed to park in, and there is almost always one available no matter where you go.  Some beaches are inaccessible unless you have the permit or you ride a bike.

If you rent or have a boat, you don't need to take a long trip to catch fish (but you may want to for some Barnacles! And Cayo costa shelling for the women).  We wasted a lot of time trying different spots.  The fish will come in from the gulf on an incoming tide starting at low tide, then feed in thr mangroves and flats on the inside of thr sound no matter which pass you fish (though I did want to try tarpon bay for redfish, but weather and circumstances prevented that).  Just figure out when they bite, get a tide chart, and be at that spot for thr 1-3 hour window on following days.  New and full moons had considerably better fishing, make sure you're out there.

This advice is for thr month of March.  I'm sure things have changed.  Tarpon should be around more, for one thing.  Just pay close attention to what others are doing and if someone is really killing them, go have a small chat.  If you find a local, really pick their brain.

Yes. We rent for the week. Pick up the car at the airport or in Fort Meyers. That said their are bike paths everywhere and so we bike a lot. No hills. Lol. Even to Jerry’s to pick up groceries for the day. That said I have no idea where you are staying etc. so kind of presumptuous of me but figured worth mentioning.

I would just rent a cheap car for the whole stay.  The area is pretty spread out- will be challenging without a car.

"Cyprina is great. Spacious and it has a pool. It’s right on the beach and most of the condos have a view of the ocean with a walkway that goes right to it. Each building has a small sunroom, a full kitchen, a living room, small dining room, massive porch, and a small bedroom on the first floor. On the second floor, there is a 2 bed room with a master bedroom and a spacious 2-sink and 2-shower master bathroom. There are two full bathrooms, one on the first and second floor. Each condo has a garage with plenty of beach toys, chairs, and umbrellas. The only downside is that most of them are a bit old, so expect old looking lights and kitchen appliances. Some of the condos are tiled rather than carpeted. Carpeted ones are better for sure, though. Each condo has a theme, too. Some have lots of white and blue Shelly looks, others have a tropical cozy shack feel. Condo #7 is a personally favorite, and I have spent a week in about all of the condos. There are grills and a beautiful garden. This place is amazing and I’ve been staying here every time I visited Sanibel for the past decade. Though, you have to rent it out for a week minimally. This is probably the place to go if you have older kids, ages 7+. I am a family of 6 and we fit in here just fine! That’s the best part, it’s so versatile in terms of housing.

"We like Lighthouse Cafe for a sit down Breakfast. But we normally get breakfast sandwiches at Bailey’s and eat them on the beach. 

Ding Darling is a great way to spend a couple hours if you need a break from the beach. You can bike, walk or drive through it. Lots of great wildlife! 

Tarpon Bay Explorers is a great place to rent kayaks and cruise through the mangroves. Again- you will definitely see some wildlife up close. 

Head to Blind Pass for a sunset. Dolphins like to hang out there too!

The top deck bar at Island Inn is our favorite happy hour spot with GREAT music and vibes.

"Welcome back! May I ask how long it's been? I've been going all my life with my family so if it's been 30 years I can tip you off to at least a couple changes or things that are still around from then. I haven't been since before COVID though, so I can't comment on that changing things on the islands.

[Pinocchio's](https://www.pinocchiosicecream.com/) is definitely my favorite place to get ice cream.

[Jerry's](https://www.jerrysfoods.com/) and [Bailey's](https://baileys-sanibel.com/) are still your best bets for on-island grocery shopping unless you pick up on the mainland. Jerry's still has tropical birds in the open air little park in the middle of the shopping center, and the liquor store, local art store and souvenir shops are still there too.

[Doc Ford's](https://www.docfords.com/sanibel-island/) is relatively new (as in like, just a bit more than a decade old!) and has great food. 

[The Bubble Room](https://www.bubbleroomrestaurant.com/home) on Captiva has gone downhill in my personal opinion food-wise, but if you miss the kitch, it's still worth a visit. Absolutely still worth a visit for their big cake slices too, they're still serving the same flavors from when I was a kid and you can just pop in to grab some and take them to go (or a whole cake, if you've got a family or a really big sweet tooth!).

The bike paths are still spectacular, and the four-way stop intersection on Sanibel has only ever gotten more crazy with traffic. 

[The Sanibel Cafe](http://www.sanibelcafe.com/) is still in the same shopping center it's always been with the same shells in pretty designs in the tablestops, my family has gone there for breakfast for decades now. 

If you remember The Hungry Heron, it's gone and been replaced by [Rosie's](https://www.rosiescafeandgrill.com/) but the menu's got the same diner-esque spirit I think. 

This is just off the top of my head, I'm sure I'm missing a lot. There are a lot of oldies but goodies (Lazy Flamingo, Cheeburger Cheeburger, Matzaluna, the little Dairy Queen with the steep steepled roof, She Sells Seashells, Traders, Jacaranda became Jac became The Tipsy Turtle, Gramma Dot's, the Lighthouse Cafe, the Mad Hatter, the Periwinkle Place shopping area) but a ton of new places too. To be honest my family never really ""saw the sights"" of Sanibel as much as just puttered around relaxing and occasionally hit up our favorite spots, so I hope this is somewhat useful even though it may not be.

"I agree. I think everyone should go to BR at least once. But you go there for the experience, Not for the food (unless you’re specifically talking about the cake). And of course, kids love it.

I’d recommend the Mucky Duck for a date night (without the kids). It’s not kid-friendly at all. It’s a nice quiet place.

"I’d probably suggest seeing if you could find a place on West Gulf Drive.  There are quite a few nice places to stay or rent.  Shalimar or the West Wind inn comes to mind and maybe Mitchell’s Sandcastles.  I personally like it on that end of the island it’s pretty quit but close enough to Baileys or Jerry’s down the road.  Both are an easy bike ride to.  Good bike paths and close to Ding Darling if you like that kind of stuff.  The sand bar restaurant is on West Gulf and has a good happy hour menu.  Doc Fords is also a short ride, there are a lot of restaurants on periwinkle to choose from.  Over easy is excellent for breakfast.  Hope that helps!

"This advice about the traffic is absolutely true and should not be taken lightly.  While we don’t live on Sanibel full time we own a cottage there.  Mostly renting out during high season and going down more off.  I can tell you from friends and other associates that we know, traffic is insane during normal business hours. Most people who live on the island will know how to work around it i.e. running errands early in the morning, using bikes instead of cars etc. Bit still it’s pretty much a nightmare.  Restaurants too are pretty much filled every night, bike paths a little harder to move around on and I also find people a little bit crankier during high season.  

Off season it’s paradise! Biking is much easier, low traffic and the beaches are just gorgeous, people seem more relaxed.  It’s easy to get a seat in a restaurant , just way more slowed down. Property is not cheap, but possibly you could find some decent rentals.  Summer is pretty hot and sweaty but it’s so beautiful there it’s well worth it.  Good luck! Lucky you to be able to make that move it’s just beyond beautiful there, just a little crazy during high season.",t2_14f12ihr,giovanna8486,0,1607876112.0,0,t1_gfpjsbp,gfpjsbp,True,SucioMDPHD,t3_kbsb2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/kbsb2z/thinking_about_moving_to_sanibel/,Thinking about moving to Sanibel,/r/Sanibel/comments/kbsb2z/thinking_about_moving_to_sanibel/gfpjsbp/,3,r/Sanibel,0,3

"Hi! Congrats! 

Fair notice, I haven't lived on Sanibel full time since 2003, part time since 2007, but my parents are still there and this comment is probably evergreen.

**Do not live far from the 4 way stop if you work off-island**. Traffic during season is truly horrific, and the closer you get to Captiva, the more isolated you will be. Family friends of ours bought a gorgeous lot near Santiva and built a house there. We warned them not to, to live closer to the 4 way stop. In season, they don't even want to drive towards mid-island to meet for happy hour because the traffic is so bad, it can take an hour to go a handful of miles.",t2_7w2gg,hispanic_genius,0,1607810093.0,0,t1_gflchh2,gflchh2,True,SucioMDPHD,t3_kbsb2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/kbsb2z/thinking_about_moving_to_sanibel/,Thinking about moving to Sanibel,/r/Sanibel/comments/kbsb2z/thinking_about_moving_to_sanibel/gflchh2/,5,r/Sanibel,0,5

"We usually are in Sanibel 4 times a year, we own a cottage there.  We have not been there this year because of COVID.  We also drive down from MA so that too stopped us from going down this year.  

We get mixed messages from friends who both live there and own/rent on what’s going on.  Beaches are ok but bike paths are getting crowed and some friends are biking on lesser known paths.  Everything is open down there. At the farmers market it’s busy and about 70% of the people wear masks. Some restaurants are pretty busy and with the no mask thing our friends try to avoid going to certain ones.  Both Baileys and Jerry’s The grocery stores require you to wear masks.  I’m sure if you are careful and just wear a mask and social distance you may be fine.  We opted to wait until May to go back down.

Great advice. Where on the island was your place. Not exactly but general vicinity. A lot depends on where our kid ends up. That said I really enjoy the island. Riding the bike path down Periwinkle to Jerry’s to shop for groceries. Stopping to check out the Parrots in the RV park on the way. Walking the beach toward the Lighthouse. After dinner Ice cream dashes to Pinocchio’s. Fishing trips on the sound. Watching play off games with the sound of the ocean in the background.

Great points. Had not thought about it from that perspective. Coastal property is definitely becoming a riskier investment. Especially one where there is a single bridge. We have currently built into our retirement plan buying a $800k second home in Florida. We typically spend 10 days on the island over the year end vacation period and love it.

I no longer have property on Sanibel but the approach to Sanibel was more my concern than that island itself. I needed to have renters to make my investment viable and my concern was that rising seas and increased storms would make Sanibel unreachable for months or even years if the bridge was damaged or destroyed or the low-lying road to the bridge was washed out.,t2_110fp,essjay24,0,1602526869.0,0,t1_g8m4m2r,g8m4m2r,True,adb1146,t3_j9tl6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/j9tl6o/sanibel_climate_change_real_estate_prices/,"Sanibel, climate change & real estate prices",/r/Sanibel/comments/j9tl6o/sanibel_climate_change_real_estate_prices/g8m4m2r/,4,r/Sanibel,0,4

Depends on the winds and more but with the hurricane I’d imagine it’s going to be very good anywhere. Sometimes you have to walk a distance from the parking lots - keep moving along until you find a spot where they are coming in.

Canopy's are allowed on the beach and I definitely recommend it and plenty of 50 SPF Sunscreen.  You don't want a sunburn to bother you for the rest of your vacation.

"The first thing I would do, is to visit the The Sanibel & Captiva Islands Chamber of Commerce **Visitor Center** as soon as you get on island.  The locals working there will give the best advice on where to go and the latest events or restrictions.   
Definitely rent a boat and check out the island.  I've never rented a boat, but maybe you can call ahead and ask a few of the boat rental places for any coves/tips.  

Visit a few of the beaches on Sanibel (and Captiva Island).  Each one is a little different.  I like Bowman's beach, Blind Pass, and the Lighthouse Beach.  Bowman's beach and Blind Pass overpass has some good fishing.  Usually, fishing is better in the early morning.  Here's some info from the bait and tackle shop.   [https://whitneysbaitandtackle.com/sanibel-fishing-spots/](https://whitneysbaitandtackle.com/sanibel-fishing-spots/)   

Some other things to do:  rent bikes and visit the shops, collect seashells on the beaches,  check out the thrift stores, drive through Ding Darling Wild Life refuge National Park (also some good fishing there), check out the Shell Museum, eat some a fried fish sandwich at George and Wendy's Seafood grille, visit the lighthouse and check out the fishing pier there, and just relax!.  

Note:  When we went there was alcohol ban on the beaches, so check with the Visitors center if the ban is still in effect.  You may want to have your thermos cups filled with your favorite ~~adult~~ beverage ;)

"The garden center on Sanibel Island is gorgeous to walk through, it sounds a bit odd, but the landscaping is beautiful. It's right across from the school and the rec center. 

Six Mile Cyprus Sough Reserve is also a must-see. Very hot and humid in June but bring some ice water and cool off in the visitor's center after your walk. 

Shipley trail connecting to pond apple trail on Sanibel is well-shaded, and good for getting out of the sun.

Sunrises at the Sanibel pier and sunset at the Mucky Duck restaurant on Captiva. They usually have an outside bar open although I'm not sure if they will during the off-peak season. 

Dolphins come out to play in the afternoon, I found that I spotted the most at the lighthouse beach on Sanibel. 

There's a randomly placed aviary in the middle of Periwinkle Trailer Park. Check it out. It's as weird as it sounds. 

Silver key beach is very secluded. Every time I went I spotted only one or two other groups. You can park at blind pass beach and walk over. There's a short trail you can walk through as well. 

There's a few art galleries scattered around the island, which were great on the unbearably hot days 

No-see-ums are a pain in the ass. One thing that worked for me was this all-natural spray made with coconut oil. I'm fairly certain you'll be able to find it at Bailey's.

We had the balcony door open so you could hear the sea... It was idyllic.

Oh it’s wonderful. We have stayed there for the past three years. Super clean. Extremely well run. Management super helpful. We just find a condo so much better than a hotel room. Price is competitive as well at the rates you wanted to pay. Direct beach access. Great location. If the website won’t give you availability for less than a week I would call the management office directly.,t2_ker66iw,adb1146,0,1584018490.0,0,t1_fkaso6s,fkaso6s,True,Elderprophetx,t3_fh8c6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/fh8c6j/romantic_3_day_weekend_help/,Romantic 3 day weekend help,/r/Sanibel/comments/fh8c6j/romantic_3_day_weekend_help/fkaso6s/,2,r/Sanibel,0,2

That’s a great point for avoid children ! So the beach is still close even if it’s across the street ( trying to wrap my mind around size of island since people say the bike it .

"We've stayed at island inn and absolutely loved it.
We had a beach view and the room was fabulous.
There is a restaurant on site, traditions on the beach, we had a top notch meal there one evening.
There are bike rentals on site, small pool and the beach is just steps away.
I would be back in a heartbeat.",t2_14zhbl,Baloolooshmoomoo,0,1583996902.0,0,t1_fka8q4w,fka8q4w,True,Elderprophetx,t3_fh8c6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/fh8c6j/romantic_3_day_weekend_help/,Romantic 3 day weekend help,/r/Sanibel/comments/fh8c6j/romantic_3_day_weekend_help/fka8q4w/,3,r/Sanibel,0,3
"I don't know the specific pricing, but I recommend [Castaways](https://castaways-cottages.com/) down near blind pass. There's not many places to stay down that far, and very little parking for people so there's usually very few kids, and if there are kids you can just walk down the beach a short ways to be away from them. 

The smaller rooms don't overlook the beach but are right across the street.",t2_gzett,seamus1992,0,1583980881.0,0,t1_fk9psfl,fk9psfl,True,Elderprophetx,t3_fh8c6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sanibel/comments/fh8c6j/romantic_3_day_weekend_help/,Romantic 3 day weekend help,/r/Sanibel/comments/fh8c6j/romantic_3_day_weekend_help/fk9psfl/,2,r/Sanibel,0,2
"I would forgo the hotel and get a one bed condo. We always stay here for 10 days over Christmas and New Year. Unless you hit a spring break I don’t think their will be kids. Beautiful pool. You can rent bikes directly from the management office on property. Ride your bikes down to Pinocchio’s for ice cream. They have some lively units overlooking the ocean but honestly all the units have a sea view.

"Sanibel Arms West is definitely my top recommendation because our first trip there we stayed at Pelicans Roost and it was horrible. Every time after we’ve stayed at Arms West. I love the place! They have many different condo buildings but only 6 face the ocean. Still it doesn’t matter to me because the place is great. There’s also a pool too with a sun deck and laundry. Across the street is the tennis court and sign in desk. At the beach walkways they have a rinse station and a shell rinse station with a shell chart. It really is great and the condos are all in great condition. I don’t want to keep repeating myself and I don’t have all the info so here’s the link
