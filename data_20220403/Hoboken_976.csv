"There's a monthly cpi that they are allowed to raise it by as stated by someone else. You can call city hall if you want to verify. They can also sometimes include extra from their own tax increases and such but your landlord would also need paperwork to show for that as well. 

As for any improvements, just make sure you have everything in writing and before and after photos. If it's cosmetic (paint, shelving, etc.) Still take photos though they may request everything be changed back to how it was originally upon move out or it will be taken out of your security deposit.

"I had a very, very bad experience and would discourage anyone from getting their wisdom teeth extracted there. Most reviews & discussion online are pretty positive, so on the one hand I might have been an outlier, but on the other the nature of my experiences suggested that the issues I had were systemic.

* The surgeon, Dr. Bo Wang, wanted to perform a quad-wisdom tooth extraction during my consultation, even though I at no time had discussed this as a possibility, had places to be after my consultation appointment, and didn't have someone available to pick me up.
* Dr. Wang **did not inform me that I was being fully sedated** with general anesthesia as opposed to laughing gas, basically until they were about to hook me up to the IV.
* The office staff very explicitly asked me to *bring someone with me when I arrived* to take me home after the surgery, so my fianc√©e (who is a teacher and can't easily take days off) took the day off. When we arrived for my surgery, they told her that ***she couldn't sit in the office due to COVID!***, and she basically had to scram until they called her to tell her I was done.
* Gave me/my fianc√©e **zero instructions for recovery care** other than a very vague piece of paper. When she called them to get some clarification, Dr. Wang was very dismissive.
* Prescribed **pain medications with no direction**. The pharmacist gave us a warning upon pickup that one of the medications they prescribed was a very strong opioid, and given current events it really shocked me that the doctor didn't take the time to explain what he was prescribing.
* **No follow-up** other than a single text, two days after the surgery, from one of the nurses.
* I do not think the surgery was done particularly well‚ÄìI was **in pain for at least a month after the surgery**, which I gathered from my own research was pretty abnormal for wisdom tooth extractions. But, because I was denied a follow-up appointment, I didn't have any way to know. Luckily it ended up not being a problem (I've seen a dentist since the surgery and all is well).
* Very **rude office staff** throughout the various interactions described above.

Some of it might be attributable to COVID (my extraction was in mid-December 2020), but for some of it, I just can't see how COVID is an excuse. Might also have been my doctor (reviews for Dr. Calat and Dr. Carunchio are pretty positive), but either way, I certainly won't be going back there if there is ever a need.",t2_2yldm4va,sand14941,0,1648997123.0,0,t1_i3887co,i3887co,True,ForeignManagement354,t3_tql596,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hoboken/comments/tql596/anyone_had_wisdom_tooth_extraction_experience_at/,Anyone had wisdom tooth extraction experience at HOBOKEN ORAL SURGEON.

"Here's the thing. You said a ""jackdaw is a crow.""

Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. 

As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be ""specific"" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.

If you're saying ""crow family"" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. 

So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people ""call the black ones crows?"" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.

Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.

"A quick point of correction, ""_biological women_"" is a pseudoscientific term. The term woman refers to a person's gender, not their physical attributes. For example, consider my friend Alice. You might think the reason Alice is a 'She' is because of things like her XX chromosomes. It's actually the other way around. All you know about Alice is that she's a woman and because of that, you assume those other physical attributes. I'm not trying to nitpick an individual term. Language like this is easy for a robot like me to spot and is indicative of other gaps in knowledge. Nobody can be expert in everything but there's a danger in the type of advocacy comments like yours have. Consciously or not this discourse is contributing to ideas that harm trans people just so people like you can avoid having your biologicalassumptions corrected.

"Depends on where you live, much easier on the west side than east. Once you do it a bit you'll learn patterns, too. Like I live near a dance studio that must let a class out right at rush hour, so lots of people are just parked temporarily, so a trip around the block is usually all that is needed to grab one of their spots. As many have noted, after 7 it gets tougher everywhere. Weekends, it's either packed and crazy or the town seems to half-empty and you have your pick of spots, mostly depending on weather and season.

Our street cleaning schedule is very simple and logical, so easy to learn and exploit if you can park during weekdays. 

A lot depends on location and timing. I'm towards the SW, so it's relatively easy here, I'd hate to have to park more near Washington, personally.

"People are super entitled right now.

I was at Stingray Lounge (upscale-ish seafood place uptown) at 730 on a Sunday for date night.

There was a group of drunk girls a couple tables over. They were being SUPER FUCKING LOUD. Like shouting and having a rager of a girls night. Two stayed behind and were continuing to woo it out and even have a loud facetime call on speakerphone with another woo girl. (This was 730 on a Sunday. Not 5pm on a Friday.)

I had enough and went over to politely to tell them to be quiet that I was there with my partner for a nice Sunday date night.

""OH HELL NO WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE QUIET WE ARE DOMINICAN. WE ARE DOMINICAN!!!! **DOMINICAN**""

As if that's some sort of excuse for being rude and selfish: rude is not a part of Dominican culture as far as I know and this isn't DR, thanks. They got up in my face calling me a Karen for asking them (politely) to stfu.

Other tables barely backed me up. The waiter said they were the rudest table they've ever had, and the restaurant gave me free dessert but wtf.

Used to be a dude was being rude, one person has enough and calls them, other people would jump in to back them up, and they'd quick being a prick. This is just one example, but it seems like the new norm is being rude and just not caring and getting extremely aggressive in response to anyone calling you out and nobody wanting to back up the people who are calling shit out.

"I'm just going to put this here for anyone who is thinking about getting mental health counseling but isn't sure what to expect. It's hard sometimes to admit you need help. Here are my personal thoughts and experience:

If you have chronic pain in your knee, you might need physical therapy and medication to heal. Your brain is no different. It's an organ and it relies on a proper balance of chemistry to operate optimally. There are tons of factors that contribute to your mental health so it's a little different for everyone. Often when you're out of balance other things suffer, you don't get enough sleep, you eat bad food, drink too much, less motivation to keep up with your responsibilities, the way you react to the people in your life.

At the end of the day it's about self improvement. Being the best *you*, for yourself and everyone around you. Your spouse, your kids, friends, family and coworkers. It can help you to be more successful in your career or achieve goals. It certainly did for me.

I went to one years ago, and I didn't know what to expect. I was very hesitant, but at the time I was so unhappy, I just couldn't shake it. So I made a consultation appointment with 3 different therapists, to see if I had a preference. I chose one guy who was about my age, and I felt comfortable with his personality.

The best way to describe it for me is that the therapist gave me life hacks for my brain. After talking to me for several sessions he started to put together what my particular ""quirks"" are. He helped me understand how I process situations and what I might be doing wrong. He offered some alternate ways of thinking about situations, or ""tools"" to use. It was the best decision I ever made and I wished I had done it when I was much younger.

It's different for everyone and depends on a lot of factors. If you're more obsessive, prone to anxiety, poor anger management, compulsive, self-destructive, there are conscious mental exercises and sometimes medication to help get you back to a more manageable place.

Right now a lot of people are dealing with the long term stress of the last few years. None of this shit is normal and there are tons of people who are in the same place as you. Even before COVID you weren't alone. Poor mental health is America's nasty little secret.",t2_c2goo7uj,AbazabaYouMyOnlyFren,0,1648644923.0,0,t1_i2pjiiy,i2pjiiy,True,njtb999,t3_trwq35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hoboken/comments/trwq35/looking_for_therapist/,Looking for therapist,/r/Hoboken/comments/trwq35/looking_for_therapist/i2pjiiy/,4,r/Hoboken,0,4

"To echo tigz, you do not pay anything, but it might make your rental less competitive if there are other listings that are cheaper (w/o the 1 mo rent to the realtor), since the tenant(s) will also be paying 1.5mo deposit + 1st month rent.

Websites like zillow make it pretty easy to set up a listing on your own., which include credit and background checks. Additionally, there are many rental contracts available online for you to use as a template.

Personally, we found our tenants through our Zillow listing, and had a lawyer check our modified rental contract before having our tenants sign. We had about 8 prospective tenants within 2 days of listing the unit. You can arrange a tour of the rental, and invite your selected tenants to apply all through the Zillow platform. We also set up an auto-pay system through a local bank so that the tenants can direct deposit the monthly rent.

"1. The term ""cheesesteak"". Let's be real. On any menu the expectation is that 99.9 percent of any restaurant that has cheesesteak on the menu is going to be a philly cheesesteak. This is not a refutable comment. It's like saying ""Apple Pie"" and someone decides to make their own version of Apple Pie with a crazy ass variation. Their cheesesteak is a variation far and beyond what a normal, expected, cheesesteak is. To deny this is just to be a simp, and even trying to defend it is asinine.

"For settling in, take lots of long walks and familiarize yourself with the various sections of Hoboken, as well as the surrounding areas - Weehawken, JC Heights, Newport, Downtown JC, and of course Manhattan. Familiarize yourself with your transportation options as well - PATH, 126 bus, light rail, etc. As mentioned elsewhere, franchise gyms include NYSC, Planet Fitness, Retro Fitness, and Crunch, though there are also lots of smaller independent gyms and group fitness class studios. Just depends on your workout needs and location. Best tip for meeting new people is honestly to get a dog.

The Stevens arrangement is not new to COVID; it has been going on for a long time because Stevens increased its enrollments over the last 10 years but did not have the dorm space on campus for all of its students. In theory this will end at some point soon because of the new dorms (the towers) that were constructed during COVID. For what it is worth. If there were more during COVID it is probably because the market was so slack for a while there and there were clearly a lot more vacant units than usual.,t2_8brve,restricteddata,0,1648010682.0,0,t1_i1ravsj,i1ravsj,False,SneakersandPuppies,t3_tibupd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hoboken/comments/tibupd/shipyard_rent_increases_2022/,Shipyard Rent Increases 2022?,/r/Hoboken/comments/tibupd/shipyard_rent_increases_2022/i1ravsj/,2,r/Hoboken,0,2
