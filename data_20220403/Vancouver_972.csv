"Agree with this. I bought a place back east in 2006, and lost (no shit) 90% or so of the value of the home in 2008. There were tons of foreclosures in my neighborhood selling at auction for $10k. I moved across country and rented it out at break even. I sold it 10 years after I bought it for $20k less than I paid for it. But because it was a rental, I got to write that off as a capital loss and recouped a lot of the money with my taxes. I was happy to get rid of it, because being a cross country landlord is a pain in the ass, but if I'd held onto it, it's now likely worth around twice what I paid for it. 

Real estate investment just has a way of somehow working out in the long term. I would only advise against it if you knew for sure you wanted to move within 5 or so years. I bought my place last summer, and maybe I overpaid, but with rates as low as they were, I got a house with a yard, and my mortgage is less than rent would be for any 2 BR apartment in the area. 

The best argument for home ownership, in my opinion, is that you're locking in your housing payment for the term of the loan. Your taxes will go up, your insurance might go up, but that's much easier to plan for than the unpredictability of rent increases.",t2_msx80,rockfordphile,0,1648998854.0,0,t1_i38c2v6,i38c2v6,False,Corgilover983,t3_tv0q1r,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/tv0q1r/current_housing_market_insight/,Current housing market insight,/r/vancouverwa/comments/tv0q1r/current_housing_market_insight/i38c2v6/,3,r/vancouverwa,0,3

"You're forgetting about the sell side.... Why would i sell my house with a 2.375% rate just so i can buy something with a higher rate? This makes all cash offers even more reasonable to maximize your leverage than they are now.

Clark County continues to see huge increases in population. This in general will lead to higher housing prices. Clark County is still cheaper as an aggregate than across the river in Portland.

Do not try to time the market. Buy when you're personally and financially ready, with a fixed rate mortgage on a payment you can pay comfortably and when you plan on living at the house for at least 5 years. Everything else is just guessing to hope you can time the market, which you can't do reliably because no one can.

"Bingo! Me and my gf had an epiphany a few years back about answering random unknown knocks at the front door. We realized that the people (family and friends) we care to spend time with, text or call us first when making plans to hang out, before ever coming over to our house. So combine that with our Nest Hello Doorbell and we now never answer a random unknown knock at the door. We also have an awesome security system in place as well.

Two things that are awesome about the Nest Hello Doorbell is 1) our Google Max Hub AI notifies us of a person at the front door (I manually setup the ‚Äúmonitoring zone‚Äù), and then we can virtually (somewhat similar to FaceTime) speak to the random person through the Nest Hello Doorbell. And 2) Via the Nest app, we turned off the ‚Äúindoor chime‚Äù setting, so the Nest Hello Doorbell will make a sound outside if the button is pressed, but there is no ‚Äúdoorbell ding-dong‚Äù sound inside of our house!

Our house is in the Clark County jurisdiction, so with the Sheriff now having reduced services in which deputies will actually respond to come help keep the peace, in hindsight I‚Äôm so thankful I got my WA CCP and purchased a legally owned firearm (Sportsman‚Äôs Warehouse) last year. The entire process from start to finish took nearly five months to complete (there was a long waiting list for new WA CC‚Äôs apps). But definitely worth it!

I highly recommend anyone living in Clark County to do the same! Remember to train in order to stay proficient (take classes if need be) at SafeFire, or wherever your favorite range is. And research and know what the WA trespassing, firearm, CCP, castle etc‚Ä¶ rcw‚Äôs, laws, rules and regulations are.

I suggest if you have any doubts about owning a firearm for self-defense, to simply look up either here on Reddit or elsewhere online vids of home invasions, gas station robberies, smash and grabs etc‚Ä¶

Specifically look at the time stamp(s) of the various vids. No joke, but in numerous cases, the actual incident is over in less than a minute. More often less than thirty seconds unless it‚Äôs a case of an extended home invasion in which criminals might do terrible things to the home occupants. In my opinion, there are worse things than death. 

The point is imagine it‚Äôs 3 AM in the morning, three armed criminals high on fentanyl and meth are coming to rob your house. They smash the window next to the front door and proceed with flashlights running up the stairs where you and your family (we don‚Äôt have kids, but you might) have been suddenly awakened. Even with the loud as* alarm  going off, and now with the reduction in services, maybe having to wait to speak with a 911 dispatcher, I‚Äôm extremely thankful I have the means to protect the person I love most (tied with my Mom). Don‚Äôt bring a knife to a gunfight, or a golf club for that matter!

My son had severe swelling and pain due to a cracked tooth as well and antibiotics have bought us a lot of time (6 weeks) until our appointment for extraction so if for any reason you cannot get in somewhere before OSHU, I recommend an urgent care appointment or stopping by zoomcare to at least get the antibiotics rx in the meantime.",t2_cv1fjyhf,AllHailTheMightyBoog,0,1648909568.0,0,t1_i340ayd,i340ayd,True,Ordinary-Rhubarb-888,t3_tua33c,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/tua33c/need_recommendations_for_emergency_dental_clinic/,need recommendations for emergency dental clinic experienced with autistic teens,/r/vancouverwa/comments/tua33c/need_recommendations_for_emergency_dental_clinic/i340ayd/,2,r/vancouverwa,0,2
"Nobody is comparing your caregiving experience to being a cop for a reason. They aren‚Äôt the same. Just because people are unpredictable in both jobs doesn‚Äôt make it a similar situation. And to be clear, nobody is judging caregivers by proxy in their criticism of the cops here. 

Cops are incredibly well paid for the amount of education and training they need, with many earning well into six figures. On a day to day basis, the job isn‚Äôt particularly difficult. They have access to basically unlimited levels of funding for gun arsenals, armored vehicles and more (unless it‚Äôs body cams of course). It isn‚Äôt among the top 20 dangerous jobs in America. You‚Äôre significantly more likely to die as a garbage truck driver or a mechanic than you are as a cop. Nobody has any flags for loggers, masons, and agricultural workers, all of whom die at a higher rate on the job and are just as necessary. 

More importantly, this isn‚Äôt an isolated incident. CCSO continues to murder the people they are supposed to defend. It‚Äôs a pattern of behaviors that is, unfortunately, not isolated to just our sheriff office. Comparing our police force to others in the developed world shows just how poorly it‚Äôs run. 

It doesn‚Äôt have to be that way. People are unpredictable elsewhere in the world, yet they don‚Äôt get murdered by cops.

"The annual rates on savings/checking accts usually stinks. Rather than look for a red herring, try this...

Debt snowball your cards/car/student loans. Pay off the smallest card. Take that payment amt and add it to the next card/car/loan, pay that off. Take the combined payment amts of both and apply to the next car/card/loan, etc. So long as you pay more than you charge, you're ahead.

Get a cash back card, use it for gas, and pay it off every month the day before it's due. You pay zero interest, and now the card company is paying /you/. The cash back adds up faster than you think.

Build $8k in an 'oh crap' savings/checking acct for when, well, crap happens. Oh crap, the hot water heater died! So buy a new one, cause you got the money waiting for just such an occurrence.

Get a brokerage acct and invest in an index fund like the S&P 500 to act as your 'savings' acct. Feed it. Watch it grow. Cash it out when it bulks up and do something nice for yourself.

"I moved here a year ago. I second having a good paying job. My friends 500 sq ft apartment just went from $1000 to $1500 with her most recent renewal. In my year here I've noticed an increase in crime. My apartment complex is one of the nicer ones but someone did get killed in a drive by shooting while taking out his trash.

I have loved the people here (I'm 25F for reference) and have felt free to be myself and explore who I am. But I was also shocked at the racism my black friends have experienced, seeing a trans person be harrassed at my place of work, and more conservatives than expected. I'm originally from the midwest and I guess I had misconceptions that that wouldn't be around this area. That being said, there is definitely less of all that here than my home state. I work with a lot of gay and nonbinary people.

It is beautiful here and that's an understatement.
I'm moving back to the midwest shortly (the cost of living is just too appealing). Groceries, mechanic, fucking GOODWILL, eating out- it's all expensive here. I was prepared for higher prices but it really adds up when everything is expensive. I've enjoyed my adventure here, it's given me a lot of growth. I'm sure at 18 it would for you as well. But I need to be able to save and enjoy life, not stress about my rent blowing up in price. Renting a single room is like $800 üôÑ

"I think you should price out a heatpump instead of a split unit (gas furnace and AC).   


I'd say that's on the high side, 12-14k is what I would expect considering you already have ducting, power, gas line, etc., but those numbers are pre-pandemic pre-supply chain pre-price gouging.  


Get a couple of quotes though, someone will hit lower, and someone will hit much higher. Find the one that fits your needs the most.  I'd also say forgo the company specific controls unless you get a honeywell. Most every system works fine with a modern smart thermostat (nest, ecobee, etc.) except honeywell for some reason.

Also, your AC compressor doesn't really care about sitting in the sun.

"In a completely other direction: I never found a group out here that sounded like it would be a good fit (but it's been 7-8 years since I looked), but in other places I've had good experiences with the Religious Society of Friends (""Quakers""), who of course have a prominent school in the general area (George Fox University). Some groups are more Bible-oriented than I'd prefer, but many are very liberal in their interpretation of... well, everything. They're all united by a belief that the Divine Light or Holy Spirit is found in every human being (regardless of creed or background); their famed absolutist pacifism stems from their refusal to harm ""the piece of God"" that is found in their fellows. The more liberal ones don't try to define what ""the Divine Light"" is, so it's easy enough for an atheist, even a non-supernaturalist like me, to decide it's ""that ineffable quality of the Human Spirit"" or what have you, and just enjoy the goings-on.

Their worship services (ones in my limited experience anyway) have a remarkable quality of serenity, as they are mostly conducted in silence, broken only occasionally by someone who feels ""led"" in the moment to share a short thought, or song, or prayer.

There are some mild cultural oddities - typically they will not refer to the days of the week by their ""pagan-origin"" names, but number them First Day through Seventh Day (for Sun-Sat), and so Sunday School becomes First Day School, etc. And for me personally I can't subscribe to their absolute version of pacifism, but it's at least easier to swallow than the warmongerism that's all-too-frequently encountered elsewhere in the world.

"Atheist here too, and parent of trans kids.

My girlfriend goes to Beautiful Savior Lutheran Church. As my background was evangelical (Calvary Chapel), Lutheran churches' liturgical style is a bit too formal for my taste, but politically this one has a lot going for it. Giant LGBTQ+ multicolor doors prominently on display in front of the church on Mill Plain (doubtless you've seen them), with a specific inclusion of the trans flag colors.

At the beginning of each service, the pastor thanks the indigenous nations whose stolen land the church now occupies, and they've been pretty conscientious of quarantining needs for COVID-19. The pastor has a conscious tendency to emphasize the human aspects of the Christ and his examples, over divinity.

I feel like this might make a good choice, as Lutheran is an old Christian tradition (being the original protestants, after all), so might be well-placed to satisfy that ""itch"" to understand more about Christianity, while at the same time being a very progressive faith. And the ritualistic nature of liturgy that turns me off, might conversely appeal to someone looking to explore the Christian tradition.",t2_uf59z,micahcowan,0,1648767969.0,0,t1_i2wv8vy,i2wv8vy,True,chrgeorgeson1,t3_tqnhlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/tqnhlu/church_for_kids_trans/,Church for kids (trans),/r/vancouverwa/comments/tqnhlu/church_for_kids_trans/i2wv8vy/,2,r/vancouverwa,0,2

"I just did our furnace and AC unit two years ago with Wolfer's (through Costco for the massive rebates) and it was \~$18,500 all told. Our house had a system and the ducting was fine, but both the furnace and AC unit died in rapid succession and we had to replace them both. 

FWIW my experience with Wolfer's (though Costco) was great. I say specifically though Costco not only for the rebates, but because Costco holds the companies they recommend to a VERY high standard to keep the relationship and Wolfer's doesn't want to sully that. A relative had Wolfer's do a job direct and there were more issues with communication though the whole experience. Your mileage may vary, but go through Costco is my reco.

- Try to shop locally and at smaller businesses. They‚Äôre our bread and butter here, and what makes Portland and Vancouver truly unique and high quality
- Be yourself. Dress how you want, be eccentric, be exciting, be different: we welcome it.
- Drive properly. Stay on the right and only use the left lanes for passing. Use your blinkers, drive at a reasonable speed, and don‚Äôt tailgate.
- Enjoy what our wonderful city and area has to offer. Go hiking, biking, enjoy the trails, enjoy the great food and coffee here.
- Be a part of the community. If you see trash on the ground, pick it up. Volunteer, keep things clean/nice for the next person.

"Worked with a moving company one summer and we helped families move from out of state with the big 53‚Äô trailers. One family was coming up from Arizona and had leased a trailer and filled it mostly with outdoor equipment; ATV, riding lawn mower, kids playground set, etc

So when we were unpacking the playground set, we all freaked the fuck out and almost quit on the spot because under the big plastic slide and in the rubber tire swing, were Black Widows. 

It looked like that whoever or whatever company had packed the truck in Arizona just hucked everything in then drove  off. Nothing was washed off the equipment, nothing was wrapped in tarp or moving padding. Shit you not, had to be at least 10 of them. 

All that being said, that was one trailer from one moving company from 15 years ago.

"You need to consider when using the logic ""They don't live around here"" or ""They don't like it around here"" that in the instances where they get brought here, they stay here until they die. Its not like its going to walk to central oregon when it gets brought here when someone moves all their dusty garage furniture. Unless their environment kills them, they live where ever they happen to be and it is absolutly not unheard of for them to even thrive in the right environments right here. The western black widows range is the entire west coast through canada, so while they may not thrive in this locale, if they are here they will just continue sitting there being spiders and randomly crapping out thousands of babies. There are many species this spider can fall under, it has all the elements of a widow spider from what I can see in the photo, but there are many other types it could be that are significantly less deadly which are most likely what this would be. The hourglass shape is a dead giveaway, and not having the hour glasses unfortunately is no guarantee it is not a widow. Personally i would never let a spider that looks like that live in my house if I can help it, so it would be a smear on the wall either way for me. Simply having faith in the idea that black widows ""dont like it here"" is enough to protect you is really stupid. They may not live here naturalyl, but these days there is any number of ways they get here and stay here. And with warmer winters year after year you can expect their natural environments to shift over time in unexpected ways. You really wont find a better answer to ""is this a widow spider"" than ""probably not"". ""Probably not"" is not the same as zero and it would be very stupid to forget that. If some guy tells you black widows dont like it around here, are ya gonna let it crawl on your arm? Hell no. So what you have is schrodingers spider, which means it is both a widow and not a widow until you can prove otherwise, and the notion that they don't like it around here does not affect that equation really at all. Better pictures would be useful. Flip it over and get the other side. Put a quarter down for scale, get more light in the photo, and you might get an accurate answer",t2_jhgzxeb,TheOneTrueRandy,0,1648677884.0,0,t1_i2rsmil,i2rsmil,True,Correct-Internet-456,t3_tsk0o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/tsk0o0/any_vancouverarea_bug_experts_killed_two_of_these/,Any Vancouver-area bug experts?

"I used Arbor Viking Tree LLC @ 503-810-7761

They were very reasonable and work safely. 

My tree was very tall and had to be removed in sections. The top part was lowered by ropes in 3' sections. They had a chipper for the limbs and would have removed the 3' wood chunks if I had wanted them to. (I gave it to friends with woodstoves) They were able to finish the job on time and didn't mess around. I paid in full, but they would consider payments. They also produce all proper Documation before starting the work. 

I don't know if they are still operating because of COVID or work in Washington.

Even if you don't call them have whoever you choose, prove all documents are current.  Make sure to verify with the city you can remove the tree with or without a permit.

When I took bids almost everyone, I talked to that was close to reasonable didn't have proper insurance or a business license. 1 accident could cost you dearly.

>The style took root in New York and other crowded cities in the US Northeast following the revisions in the 2000 IBC edition,[5] and it exploded in popularity in the 2010s, following a 2009 revision to IBC, which allowed up to five stories of wood-framed construction.[7]",t2_2wom7z8f,Babhadfad12,0,1648650105.0,0,t1_i2puxn8,i2puxn8,False,higleyc99,t3_trwkbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouverwa/comments/trwkbk/sure_theres_a_housing_crisis_but_at_least_weve/,"Sure, there's a housing crisis.

NIMBYs complaining about parking despite the whole design is to be mass transit/walking friendly.

NYMBYs got their wish and the city now requires 1.25 parking spaces for every unit in the development, even studio apartments and 1BR where people are far less likely to need multiple cars.

This same NIMBYs will gladly take the increase housing values of the heights, and gladly use the walkable restaurants and services, but then still complain about the development. Infuriating.

"There may be some of that going on, but it's also true that storage is commiserate with increased density, especially during a transition from low to higher density, like you see with gentrification and redevelopment.  

A plot of land that used to be a single family home with a garage and lots of closets and a basement and an attic housing 4 - 6 people is redeveloped into a duplex or similar housing twice as many people with half as much storage means everyone involved is going to have to have a place to put their Shit.  

Repeat that pattern en masse across a large area, and you'll see lots of storage facilities show up to meet the demand.

"Unless they're dropping off a package or a friend/relative/neighbor, I assume straight away that they're selling something.  I enjoy random conversations with people that I don't know.  More importantly, I enjoy wrapping them up in my narrative and observe how they struggle to regain control with their script.  If it's a religious solicitor, I ask them about the spiritual nature of dogs on alien planets. (fun fact: JW's don't believe in voting)  If it's a pest control company, I ask them why they want to exterminate sugar ants when they're the ones keeping the Texas fire ants and Argentinian crazy ants at bay. If it's a solar roof salesman, I ask them why my Clark Public Utilities community solar program is much more awesome than what they're selling.  (I later found the laminated SunRun sales material littering the water catch tree bush area around the neighborhood.  I didn't want to quash his dreams of sales.  I just wanted his perspective that led him to that life path leading up to my doorstep.)  It's helpful to set my phone's recorder going first because sometimes people give me pure creative fiction writing gold.  I'm now eagerly awaiting the political activists.  I'm all ready with a sweet set of questions.  I'm also up on my reading such as Ayn Rand ... only I see her books in a broader context that leads to yet more fabulous questions.
