I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news but everything you’ve been taught about God is a lie. The perception of Christians has been manipulated to a point where they all sound crazy like you because you’re not even close. You’re just on a page searching for attention about something no gives a fuck about. If you are really for God then stop listening to outside influences and search yourself for the truth. The truth is inside us. We were built with it. You sound crazy. You’re not gonna get results you like this way. As far as repentance. What is sin for one may not be sin for another.

"First take away $300,000 from the turtle program and order National Park Service Chief Scientist Dr. Donna Shaver not to apply for anymore grants. Next bully and harass Dr. Shaver and humiliate her to make her to quit.  (Note, it is hard to make a woman quit if she is protecting animals or children and when it comes to sea turtles, Dr. Shaver is like a momma grizzly bear.)  
  
What is the next ill-advised step the National Park Service could take?  How about sabotaging your social media? Padre Island National Sea Shore has a page with 72K followers and they are shutting it down.  
  
Padre Island NS Division of Sea Turtle Science & Recovery  
  
https://www.facebook.com/nps.pais.seaturtles  
  
Do you know how long it takes to get 72K followers? For starters, you needed the foresight to start your Facebook page a few years before 2014 when Facebook’s new algorithm made it exponentially more difficult to gain followers.  The answer is you needed to start your page a minimum of ten years to get these enviable numbers. The page they are shuttering is from 2010.  
  
But never mind that other agencies would love to have a page with 72K followers, the National Park Service is just going to shut this one down.  Maybe they think shutting down the page will make the turtles go away.  (I don’t think so, see the Green turtle photo above. I took that on the beach today a few yards from Padre Island National Seashore.)  
  
But not to worry, NPS started a new group page.  This idea could only have been proposed by someone who has not run a group page recently. They are a nightmare these days. Groups grow like crazy with scammers and spammers and overseas bots, but not legitimate members.  I don’t know how the NPS will handle it, but I ended up setting my public group page so I have to approve every single post to prevent inappropriate posts that would cause Facebook to shut down the group. It will be way more work for NPS to maintain the small new nothing group than it was to maintain the giant prestigious useful page that is going away.  
  
Speaking of going away, has anyone at National Park Service heard of records retention?  You can’t just delete a federal social media page. So, heads up, NPS!  
  
What a way to NOT run things . . .  
  
I suggest you all go like the page that is going away because it would be nice to get it to that 100K milestone before it goes away for good.  https://www.facebook.com/nps.pais.seaturtles",t2_gymhl,marilynlitt,0,1648778102.0,0,t1_i2xhqyk,i2xhqyk,True,marilynlitt,t3_ttfgvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpusChristi/comments/ttfgvy/how_to_destroy_a_national_park_service_sea_turtle/,HOW TO DESTROY A NATIONAL PARK SERVICE SEA TURTLE PROGRAM,/r/CorpusChristi/comments/ttfgvy/how_to_destroy_a_national_park_service_sea_turtle/i2xhqyk/,10,r/CorpusChristi,0,10

"The beautiful little white chapel is a picturesque hidden gem that offers unparalleled views of sunrise, sunset, and surrounding sand dunes. Tucked away from the crowds of beach-goers and known only to avid Port Aransas history-lovers.


The Chapel on the Dunes is located in an older section of Port Aransas in a residential area at 203 South 11th Street (where it intersects with Avenue B). While built on private property, the Chapel is situated on top of a beautiful sand dune behind the main house on the property.

It was built between 1937-1938 by Aline B. Carter. Mrs. Carter was a Texas-born poet and humanitarian who lived on Mustang Island, and was Poet Laureate of Texas from 1947-1949.

Being a very spiritual woman, she was called the “White Angel” because of her flowing, white organdy dresses and loving service to the surrounding community. The Carter family still owns and maintains the Chapel.

Mrs. Carter used her charming little Chapel for meditation and inspiration for writing her poetry books. It was (and still is today) a place of spiritual refuge and peace.

After her death 1972, artist John Patrick Cobb painted the white-washed interior with inspiring Biblical murals. The murals depict Old Testament stories along the north wall, and imagery from the New Testament on the south wall.

The Port Aransas Museum offers free guided chapel tours every first and third Saturday of each month starting at 9:15 a.m.  Additional times may also be available on request.  Please make reservations with the Museum at 361-749-3800 one day ahead (before 4:00 p.m.). 


The chapel is locked between tours, however, you may walk up to the Chapel and view its exterior at any time.",t2_u940w,Goldenchicks,0,1648297938.0,0,t1_i26orpn,i26orpn,True,Goldenchicks,t3_tonja5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpusChristi/comments/tonja5/featured_local_attraction_the_chapel_on_the_dunes/,"Featured Local Attraction: The Chapel on the Dunes was built between 1937 and 1938 by Aline B.

"Howdy! Welcome. This is the cheapest coastal property you can get really and there is a small, but passionate surf community. I myself surf! First of all, any boards work here, but honestly foamies are great cause of all the mushy waves and often small swell. Having one will keep you surfing more often and you can keep the fish/short for big days.

**Areas**

*Padre Island aka “The Island”*
-	Where all the good surfing is at
-	North point of it is Port Aransas which is touristville during spring break, summer, and holidays, but gorgeous usually and Horace Caldwell Pier is a good surf spot. More pitchy and steep on big days and good for shortboarding, but good for all boards. Left side is generally older/rookie crowd and right is generally best about halfway out at “the bowl” and more experienced riders or young chargers congregate there
-	15min south down the island is the main bridge over from the mainland and neighborhoods crowded around that juncture I usually refer to as “The Canals” because many of them are on little fingers of land terraformed to be canals kinda like Venice with houses all along them. ***If you can afford it, as a surfer with a family, I would live here.*** It is growing still business-wise and has a little “riverwalk” being built and also is near Padre Island National Seashore aka PINS, a protected national park. There are a few good surf spots between Port A and here and a couple right next to here at the Packery Channel jetties (my fav spot). Best side depends on wind direction cause you want to be blocked by the jetty from wind. Expensive here but again *very cheap* compared to other island property

*The Mainland*
-	Del Mar/suburbs near Downtown: Good schools, quaint and usually well kept, wealthier area on the mainland, and l good schools. Affordable as “nice areas” go and near the ocean though not on it. Farmers market downtown nearby on Wednesdays. Lots of stuff to do and parks and a city beach not worth surfing but ok for hanging at. 30min to The Island
-	South Side: sprawling suburbs high growth area. Generally cheaper than other areas in town but also somewhat poo poo’d for being dingey or “hood” in spots. Nice place, great value with room to expand to the south, but not close to a beach. However, everything is still only ~30min from The Island
-	Flower Bluff: small island between the mainland and Padre Island with a few businesses on it. Again kinda poopoo’d for being dingey/hood, but a perfectly fine place. None of the beaches on it are surfable because the water is very shallow between the mainland and Padre. Very affordable

I would live on The Island near or on the canals if I were you. 5-15mins from all local breaks, safe, unique culture/sense of community, development, and really not terrible expensive for what you get.

">Probably a long-shot without experience but would love to get hired on a rig/boat crew type job as an apprentice. Any information y’all folks can give would be fantastic.

I assume you mean like a tug boat type crew? I don't know about any specifically but I would start with [Express Employment Professionals](https://www.expresspros.com/corpuschristi/?utm_source=gmb&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=Qiigo)  They fill a lot of industry positions. 

You could also try [TX Dot for a deckhand on the Port Aransas Ferry boats](https://g.co/kgs/f6U5AD) 
Hopefully that link works but if not just google ""deckhand on Port Aransas Ferry Boat"" and it comes up. It's om the TxDot website. That job was posted recently and I think they are always hiring. 

Failing that you could check with Harrison's Landing at the CC Marina. It is a restaurant on the water but they have several boats they take tourists on daily.

THREE WAYS TO RUN BEACH TO BAY


RELAY: 6 RUNNERS


The Original and largest Relay Marathon.
Max running distance 5.25 miles


RELAY: 2 RUNNERS


Each teammate will run three legs of the Relay Marathon. This is a NOT a half marathon.


FULL MARATHON: 1 RUNNER


Run the full
26.2 miles solo!


**HISTORY** (from the website)

Every year since 1976, runners and fun-seekers alike grab their running shoes and converge in Corpus Christi, Texas to take on this beloved six-leg marathon. Our event has become an annual tradition for many of these runners, reuniting them with friends they’ve made from marathons past.


Beach to Bay has grown into one of the largest relay marathons in the United States. Attracting runners from all over the U.S. as well as Kenya, England and Mexico, Beach to Bay boasts an annual registration rate of over 2,000 teams.


This is a six-leg running event, both in relay and full marathon format for those who prefer to take on a challenge solo, that totals approximately 26.2 miles of the Gulf Coast beach, pavement (including the JFK Causeway!), a little sweat, an occasional tear, and a bunch of smiles. Beginning on the sands of North Padre Island, winding through Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, and ending at McCaughan Park along Corpus Christi’s scenic Shoreline Drive, the legs are roughly 4.4 miles each. Always held on the third Saturday in May, or Armed Forces Day, Beach to Bay honors the men and women serving in our United States Military with sincere pride – a tradition founded by Captain John Butterfield back in the inaugural year of 1976.",t2_u940w,Goldenchicks,0,1646625368.0,0,t1_hznvhbt,hznvhbt,True,Goldenchicks,t3_t8gf0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpusChristi/comments/t8gf0m/beach_to_bay_relay_marathon_returns_this_year_on/,Beach To Bay Relay Marathon returns this year on May 21.

"You mentioned that you’re going to be working remote. Will you need true ethernet access, or can you operate by Wi-Fi? If the later is the case…

For this price, I’d seriously consider buying a 5th wheel or RV. Just to give you an idea of housing, our three bedroom two bath is priced over 300k on Zillow. We bought our house at 220 in 2019, and could probably turn a very nice profit at present. It’s a sellers market; houses aren’t even sitting on the market for more than a week before being sold. I’ve also heard through the grapevine that buyers are having a hard time being approved for the loan for their house. The housing market is ridiculous right now. We’re thinking of upgrading to a 4bdrm - we’re expecting (different gender than our current child) and NEED an office/extra room, and all the options we’ve looked at have been over 400k. And I’m not talking fancy houses with custom cabinetry. I’m talking regular style cookie-cutter houses that just 10 years ago were priced closer to 200k. 

We get a lot of winter Texans, a.k.a. snowbirds. There are some very nice RV parks (especially near Rockport) that have easy access to water for your kayak, walking for your dog, fishing, the whole 9 yards. My coworker’ father actually sold his house, and bought an RV that made his previous dwelling look like a shack. I’m sure for 200 K you could find a very nice two bedroom fifth wheel, and then if you end up not liking the place that you’re in, you could always relocate.

Don't listen to all the negative people. If you want to be near the water then stay on the island or port aransas area. The hotels will cost more there but they are directly on located on the beach. If you're on a budget stay someplace in corpus and drive to the beach. It's only 20 min but you will need to buy a beach permit.. Downtown Corpus bayfront is nice to walk around and it's free. The Lexington is cool. There's even an escape room in it. Aquarium is nice but pricy. They're lots of good restaurants on the island. If you're in corpus eat at Nikos. Best stakes in town and reasonably priced. If you like Mexican food there Taqueria Jalisco restaurants everywhere. Fresh authentic Jalisco style Mexican food. The best seafood is Railroad station downtown. Brewsters downtown is a fun place to hang out. Always live music and fun crowd.

"From the Bluntzer Fruit Stand FB page:


""🚨Store Closing. Final sale begins today, Thursday, March 3rd, 2022 at 10am and ends Sunday, March 6th, 2022 at 7pm or when all perishable inventory is depleted. You have 4 days or less left to #ShopBFS


😔 Unfortunately, the time has come for BFS to shut its doors. There are many factors that have, regretfully, led me to make this decision. Running a small business can be difficult when the cost of goods and cost of transportation of goods reach record highs while product availability remains at an all time low. — It can be especially difficult when long term business partners go their separate ways, and when one takes with them the the very resources the business needs to successfully operate, pay employees, pay suppliers, source merchandise, etc... Hypothetically speaking of course.


🧐 What does this mean for the future? Although the storefront will be closing, we will do our very best to continue to attend pop up markets & events, Loca for Local being next (Saturday, March 12th, 2022). Please stay tuned for posts, emails, and text message updates regarding any events that we may be attending in the near future. 


💔 We are just as saddened, if not, more, than you may be after hearing this news. On behalf of myself and the remaining members of the BFS team, I would like to thank you for your patronage, support, kind & encouraging words, positive feedback, and for simply being the best customers we could have ever asked for.  You were the often the best part of our days and will most assuredly be missed. 


Nevertheless, this isn't goodbye. It's see you later... I still believe the Coastal Bend has not seen the last of BFS.
- Nicholas (Nick) Arguijo, Owner

"There are twelve historical Corpus Christi homes located in Heritage Park. Many of these are recorded Texas Historical Landmarks, the oldest one dating back to 1851. Each home pays tribute to the area’s ethnic and cultural diversity. If you are interested in learning more about the history of Corpus Christi, visiting Heritage Park is an excellent place to begin your history lesson.

"Parts of North Beach, Padre Island, Flour Bluff have all been subject to storm surge over the past 100 years. These have been in the low-lying areas.  

I've been here about 50 years, and the worst hurricane flooding I remember was during Hurricane Allen in 1980. The City had an evacuation order out for North Beach, and officers tried to get everyone off the peninsula. Two of the people who wouldn't leave were found after the storm, drowned. When they tell you to get out, go.

Downtown was completely flooded in the 1919 Storm. That was the impetus for building the seawall and Shoreline Dr. Before that, Water Street was *on* the water.

This I couldn't tell you. You'll need to find answers on the Padre Island National Seashore webpage. 

I doubt that Malaquite is packed. It attracts mostly adults and families, instead of high school and college students. You can get down the Island past the paved road by driving on the packed sand not far from the high tide mark. Be aware that this area is not patrolled well. And pay attention to weather forecasts.

"Oh man, that sucks, sorry man. I lived in my car for a year. It's not the worst place for it. 

For parking i primarily parked at autopart stores, autozone, orielys, advanced, ext. They're pretty used to random folks leaving their cars there overnight and there's enough of them in town that they'll have forgotten your car next time you park there if they even noticed it in the first place last time. Park on the side if you can, preferably after closing and not near the dumpster so the employees dont have to walk past your car and potentially notice you. Most wont give a fuck but there's occasionally gonna be the odd person out there who will. Occasionally i would hit up walmarts and other big box stores. I never got chased out of them but the parking lot security folks running around all night always made me to nervous for a good nights sleep.

On the note of parking, make sure you have a way to blackout the windows at night. It'll keep the light of your phone from leaking out if you use it for anything and makes it so nosy folks cant casually look thru your windows. At night, black fabric behind glass just looks like really dark tint from the outside. I zip tied dowels to the oh-shit handles so i could better hang blackout curtains and custom cut a sunscreen for the windshield to make sure there were no light leaks. Worked great, i would stay up another hour or 2 to do homework when i parked somewhere with wifi. Had plenty of employees, drunks, and cops walk right by me despite the bright ass laptop screen and the very obvious bed i'd made out of the passenger seat (i had removed all the extra seats for more space and had a actual bed).

Also, once you park for the night do not get out of the car unless you plan on relocating entirely. You need to get you a piss bottle if your the type of person who occasionally needs to go in the middle of the night. 

For an address, best is if you have a friend in town who will let you use theirs. But if you dont then you can rent a mailbox at the UPS store or one of the little mail stores, they're not technically post office boxes. Just write the box # as if it was an apartment #. I prefer the mom and pop mail stores personally, banks are far less likely to have flagged them as P.O. boxes than UPS locations but for applications and all that even a USPS P.O. box is perfectly adequate. 

Showers. Wetwipes or sponge bath will be plenty good for nearly all occasions and is what i did most days, just in the car with the curtains up so folks couldn't see me. But for when you really want a deep clean a basic membership to freedom fitness is $10 a month and gets you showers and climate control for when you really need it. Plus, since your already there might as well work out! The exercise is great for fighting off depression and when your living in your car every little bit of help you can get in that department is a god send.

To hot, to cold. Honestly, its never actually to hot or to cold here. Oh, don't get me wrong, it will suck balls sometimes. I'm sure the past couple nights have been very uncomfortable. But, as long as you've got a half decent jacket and/or enough blankets then a couple hours on the edge of freezing in a car are easily survivable. Enough blankets and it can even be quite comfortable. You don't need to really worry about freezing to death till things get closer to zero. The heat... well most nights are muggy af but plenty doable, some nights you gotta say screw the anonymity of the blackout curtains and just sleep with the windows wide open for the airflow. If the night temps were gonna be high enough then i would go beach camping with a cheap tent, if your car can handle the sand anyways. Overall, you just get used to sleeping at those temps eventually. I caved and got a cheap hotel room 3 times the first month cause of how hot it was at night but after a couple months i was making it thru even hotter nights no problems. 

During the day, if i wasn't at work or have anything better to do during the particularly hot parts of the day then i'd go to McDonalds. Get a drink and something off the dollar menu and spend a few hours there using the wifi and charging my devices. Theres also parks with trees for shade or hanging out on ocean dr for the breeze and of course you can never go wrong with the library. Reading is such a great way to spend time when you've got a lot of it on your hands and library's are free!

Honestly, the best bit of advice i can give to anyone facing homelessness is to not look homeless. Thats feels like a pretty terrible thing to say but it's reality, people treat you as lesser if they think your homeless. Your not likely to get the job if your not clean and kept looking. Do your laundry, take a bath, brush your teeth and you hair, don't let yourself go.",t2_eyeo2,SinkPhaze,0,1644132773.0,0,t1_hvsc8f3,hvsc8f3,True,2000sSilentFilmStar,t3_sll11s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpusChristi/comments/sll11s/living_out_of_car_in_cc/,Living out of car in CC,/r/CorpusChristi/comments/sll11s/living_out_of_car_in_cc/hvsc8f3/,20,r/CorpusChristi,1,20

"Corpus Christi, founded in the mid-1800s, was originally built as two parts – a lower, sea level commercial development along the bay and a higher, residential area along a bluff overlooking the bay. The Texas Greek Revival-style Britton-Evans House was one of the first homes completed on this upper level, built in 1849 by Forbes Britton. Britton, a partner in the shipping firm of Britton, Mann and Yates, operated a freight line between Corpus Christ and the port of Galveston. The firm specialized in shipping cured hides from Mexico.


 Britton served in the Texas Legislature from 1857 to 1861 before selling the home at the onset of the Civil War. In 1862, the Confederate army requisitioned the house as a hospital before Federal troops took the city in 1866. The Federal army continued to use the house as a hospital as well as officer’s mess hall. George F. Evans, import-export merchant, bought the house in 1880 and it remained the Evans family home for the next 56 years.


Today, the historic home has been restored and is maintained by the Corpus Christi Area Heritage Society.

Do not let your children go to the water on the bay go to the island to get in the water my friend is currently had a bacterial infection for 6 months from the water in the bay. He was fishing in the bay scraped his leg and doctors can't get rid of the infection. Padre Island is like 20 minutes from here. You may be able to get a more cost-effective room in town but the island is where it's at. My sister came from up north we got a very reasonable three bedroom condo on Padre for 4 days and it was $600.

I live downtown CC and the beaches are lovely.. There is lots to do.. on North beach there are lots of places to stay.. and The Texas State Aquarium is right there.. It’s one of the most child/family friendly Aquarium.. Also the port is right there and you can watch the ships come in with the tug boats guide them.. Next to that on North Beach is the USS Lexington with amazing tours everyday.. Lots of good restaurants in that area you can walk to.. Downtown T-heads is fun to go to and scooter 🛴 to ride along the sea wall that was designed by Sculptor Gutzon Borglum but he started Mt Rushmore and someone else actually built it.. We have Heritage Park with museums and the arts center downtown across from the CC beaches.. Corpus Christi is called the Sparkling City by the Sea.. It’s very safe downtown.. Our police are well trained and helpful.. Doubt you would need one but they are plentiful.. I think you could have an enjoyable safe trip.. The international airport is fairly close.. You could also make day trips to Padre island.. Port A is about 45 minutes to a hour drive depending on traffic.. Mustang reserve is great day trip.. so much to do..,t2_9mj68gim,carverkids,0,1643865808.0,0,t1_hvdt6mz,hvdt6mz,True,kristineline,t3_sj44ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpusChristi/comments/sj44ac/good_place_to_vacation_two_michigan_moms_and_6/,"Good place to vacation?

"I'm not from Corpus but I love going there for vacation. My family and I usually find a place on North Padre Island and spend our beach time at Padre Island National Shoreline. The beaches there are pretty nice but nothing like South Padre Island or Destin. It's still really nice though.

"North Padre Island is part of Nueces County, and parts of it belong to Corpus Christi. The beaches in mainland Corpus Christi are McGee Beach and North Beach, which are fine for a quick dip, but you want to be on the Island. There's a $12 beach parking tag for Nueces County beaches, which pays for upkeep. It's good for a year., and available at stores in Corpus Christi. 

For Spring Break, I'd say that North Padre and Mustang Island (Port Aransas) are more family-friendly than South Padre. You can actually camp on Malaquite Beach, which is part of the Padre Island National Seashore. Check out https://www.nps.gov/pais/index.htm for specifics.

Why is that a problem?  With $40 admission prices I would hope that they are making money.

>They can hire more people with better expertise.

Are you claiming that their staff doesn't have appropriate expertise?  That's a pretty damming claim, do you have a source for that? 

>They once put a guy in charge of fundraising who literally helped cover up for a local politician who sends beautiful women out to lonely men at night for 300-1000 dollar haircuts.  

Source?  Sounds like an interesting story.  Was there no repercussions from the aquarium when he was doing that?  Did they support it?

>And they do not vet their hires properly. 

Source?  Why do you think they aren't vetting appropriately?  What would you have them do differently?  Is it all staff that are improperly vetted or specific positions?

"With a mission of rehabilitating, rescuing, and protecting ocean wildlife and educating guests on the importance of that mission, the aquarium provides various programs, lots of exhibits, and tons of information.


Your Caribbean Journey begins in the jungle, a captivating exhibit showcasing the unique wildlife and geography of the Sian Ka’an Biosphere Reserve in Mexico’s Eastern Yucatan Peninsula. This magnificent space lets in natural sunlight from a massive skylight, providing a natural home for tropical flora and fauna including vibrant free-flying birds, bats, and reptiles. 


One particularly notable offering is the Living Shores exhibit, which displays information regarding Corpus Christi’s Laguna Madre and exhibits of crabs and seahorses alongside one of the state’s biggest touch pool experiences.


Another very popular exhibit is the 400,000-gallon Dolphin Bay, home to Atlantic bottlenose dolphins that you can observe from underwater.


And of course, there’s Floating Phantoms, home to sea nettles and jellyfish.


If you’d like to see non-fish animals, you’ll be able to go to the Hawn Wild Flight Theater at the aquarium to view different birds of prey as they put on a performance of acrobatics.


For flora-lovers, the Flower Gardens showcase coral reefs that house cow nose stingrays, green moray eels, and tarpon.


Hours: Tuesday - Sunday 10 a.m. – 5 p.m.


Tickets: adults $39.95. Military, students and senior citizens $37.95. Children 2 and under free.

"It was a key player at Pearl Harbor in the 5th Fleet, where it served as a carrier for combat aircraft.


Its dark blue color, which afforded it impressive camouflage that tricked Japanese forces, earned it a special nickname: The Blue Ghost.


Here, it is a museum that educates visitors on the history and function of naval battles and aviation, as well as showcasing its own tale and legacy.


In addition, it hosts a flight simulator, a special escape room, a 3D movie, and virtual battle stations!


The USS Lexington has five different routes to take on a self-guided tour, so there’s no shortage of what to do when it comes to ways to explore its 1,000 square-foot interiors.


You’ll get to see the crew quarters, the flight and hangar decks, the command central, the forecastle, and even multiple different vintage aircraft.


Special tours, like paranormal hunt tours or camping overnight tours, give you access to even more parts of the ship.

"Yellow Bird is a popular brand of hot sauces out of Austin TX.  I think the habanero is probably their most popular but honestly they are all good.  The larger HEB's in town will carry it.  Alternatively there is Humble House which is out of San Antonio.  Their Ancho and Morita is my favorite but they are all fantastic (though not super spicy).


For jerky, I am partial to Praseks which is out of Hillje TX.  Again, the bigger HEB's carry it but you may have to ask since I think they keep it in a weird area of the store.

Edit:  Speaking of Yellow Bird, here's a recipe from film critic, horror icon, and Texas native Joe Bob Briggs for his ""redneck power bars"":

Combine 1 lb Lil smokies, 1/2 can beer (he calls for Coors, I use Busch), and 1 bottle of Yellow Bird Habanero in a saucepan, bring to a boil, and simmer until the liquid is gone.

It's delicious but not for the faint of heart.  They go great with ice cold beer.",t2_lirfs,texasrigger,0,1642627943.0,0,t1_htdfl62,htdfl62,True,LadyHikesALot,t3_s80lki,https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpusChristi/comments/s80lki/hot_sauce_and_jerky_recommendations/,Hot sauce and jerky recommendations,/r/CorpusChristi/comments/s80lki/hot_sauce_and_jerky_recommendations/htdfl62/,5,r/CorpusChristi,0,5
