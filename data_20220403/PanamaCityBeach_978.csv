"I’ve been coming to PCB annually for 20 years. We prefer the far west end. It’s super quiet. We also like to hit 30a and ride our bikes along the path over there. There’s not much to do down there but the space you’ll have to spread out on the beach is worth it for us. I don’t feel like I’m going to lose my kid(s) in the mass of people. We’ve stayed at Splash, Calypso and Tidewater, and a few others. Tidewater was waiting an eternity for an elevator but they have stuff for kids to do like a movie night at the pool and sno comes and whatever other activities they may plan. Game room and Starbucks on site as well. Calypso also has two pools but the same parking and elevator situation. Also security at these high rise buildings can be super annoying. It’s also crazy loud here since it’s right across from pier park. Splash was incredibly crowded, parking sucked and we hated the pool layout. If you stay in a high rise, just don’t stay over the 4th floor. I cannot stress how awful the elevator situation is in the summer months and during spring break. Off season may not be as bad but we rent a house if we come in the off season. We don’t mind driving a few miles to pier park or even further to StAndrews for the day. We’ve been staying at Ramsgate Harbour for the last couple of years and I prefer it over the high rise condos. I’ll take one or two small flights of stairs over waiting for an elevator any day of the week. Anything over 10 floors and you can plan on spending at least 1/8 of your entire vacation waiting for an elevator. And the parking garages are a nightmare.

"I've been there during both spring and fall Bike Weeks in PCB before. Honestly the bikes haven't ever really bothered us that much. It's more crowded but it's not awful. And if you are looking to spend a lot of time on the beach and in the Gulf or pools it's honestly not that bad.   


There's always noise in PCB between loud people, cars on the road behind the hotels, planes, etc. The bikes do roar a bit at night but I don't hear them from inside of the condo when I'm there. I will be there during Bike Week in the spring again this year and don't really have any issues thinking it's going to be awful.   


Just time things right. We always go out to eat early afternoon if we are going to go somewhere. Even with the bikers as long as you aren't at one of the bars you'll still be good for the most part.

"I am not sure if I am allowed to post this so please remove if not but we have a short term rental property at Laketown Wharf.

Example. Let's say you live in a community that is not being well represented and needs an essential service that the other communities nearby enjoy (such as repaired roads, well funded schools, sidewalks.) You have the ability to elect a representative that would advocate for your community as effectively as the others around you who are already well represented. THEN they gerrymander your district so much that it is impossible to get a majority to elect that representative. All those funds stay in the hands of the monied/well represented, and the gerrymandered community remains powerless.

"You may frame ""abortion"" in terms of women's rights but sadly I hear little talk of the child's God given rights. Having known multiple women who've had abortions, there are long-term negative effects. I belive this because deep down, our God given conscience knows it's very wrong. We don't get to play God & decide if/when it's a life. Texas, Mississippi & other states just protected the most vulnerable from being killed because some called them ""not a child."" While I sympathize with rape victims, every other man & woman can choose to remain abstinent. If they don't, they except the responsibility of reproduction. How long do you think God will turn a blind eye to the killing of so many?

"The reality is eveyone, everywhere has lines they will not cross & things they will censor. We would not show elementary children hard-core porn & give them the option to act if out in class, as we would consider that sexual abuse. Nor would we show an excessively violent and gory film to young children, as that would be traumatic. The problem, now, is there has become a growing divide on what is healthy vs unhealthy. As a Christian, I do not believe anything beyond heterosexuality expressed sexually inside monogamous marriage or deviation from one's biological sex/gender is healthy or good. You might disagree with me on that, but to start putting these ideas inside of children I do not think is appropriate. We've seen MULTIPLE cases where that is abused, to the point teachers are actively encouraging hiding things from parents ( https://youtu.be/4L0M7oow2eY ).

"Lol ok buddy if that’s what makes you feel superior go ahead. You know nothing about me. Never have been pregnant and never want to be.   There’s a huge leap you’re making.

"You know birth control isn’t 100% right? The responsibility does land on the female bodied person as their body does the work and pregnancy and giving birth are incredibly hard on the body. They are then responsible for feeding for at least 6 months. 

If they aren’t going to be a good parent is it wise to have them parent when they don’t want to or know how? Is that fair to a child or society to continue the cycle of bad parenting? 

Society puts a lot on the female bodied parent and less on the male. Often the male isn’t part of the child’s life once born and it lands on the one that had the baby. 

In the US it’s rare to have any kind of parental leave so if a single parent is lacking support or resources they are then reliant on what little they get from government assistance. Also do you know how expensive it is to just have a baby not including care prior to or after and not including everything else once it’s born?

"They definitely aren’t. I’m in Canada now (used to be in PC for a long time). They’ve done awful things and there’s Qanon and white supremacists involved. They have Nazi flags.  There’s a huge list of things they’ve done while occupying Ottawa, there’s also groups of them blocking the border crossings (blocking truckers who aren’t part of the convoy from food and medicines not to mention holding up supply for people who need them).  They desecrated the war memorial and statues of Canadians who would never be in support of what they’re doing. They pissed on and danced on the grave of the Unknown Soldier plus parking on the monument. They’re also harassing people of colour, non heterosexual and non cisgender people, they’ve harassed health care workers, soup kitchen patrons and staff and demanded food meany for the homeless and vulnerable. They shit on the steps of someone’s home who was flying a pride flag. The list goes on. There is nothing about this that is done in love. It’s hate and terrorism. Can you imagine trying to live your life and have people blaring truck horns for 2 weeks + non stop?

The town already bans gangsta rap concerts at clubs, Fact look it up At the taco place near the bridge some local kids were getting food as was a group from Atlanta, they asked the locals if they could buy a bag, THey went out to the parking lot to do their thing, When one perp from Atlanta drew a gun on one of the locals his brother jumped in between them and the perp shot twice killing him. As they were escaping his friend asked why did he shoot the dude, he said he didn't want to pay 40.00. That was testimony in court. the perps family never came to court, A 19-year-old brother, uncle,  son,  and a friend died for $40.00, on a whim.  That same year a girl was shot and left in a ditch outside the Club La, look it up. Or how about the house party all from Atlanta guy was smoking dab pulls out a gun and starts shooting in the indoor party people ran into the street to get away one was hit by a passing car on Thomas Drive 3 died 10 injured.

"That looks great! I’m sure they will love it! That’s such a romantic story that they met there and are still together! 🥰 saw so many that were just about the hook ups so even more amazing is when you hear the stories of people who found their person not just a hook up. It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years lol. Made me realize it’s been 20 years since I graduated high school 🤣 good lord where does the time go?! We moved to PC in 1999 do think my first spring break experience there would have been 2000. It was crazy and exciting for a few years, but then it got old. It was definitely a time in my life I’ll remember though. PCB has definitely changed from what I’ve heard. It was starting to change while I was still there. They got rid of a lot of the smaller hotels and started putting up more high rise condos/time shares. I don’t think they see the same influx of spring breakers as they did back then. The end of an era it would seem. I watched a few videos on YouTube from around 2000-2003 just for fun after seeing your post. Hard to believe that most of the people in them are now in their late 30’s to early 40’s lol. Then I remember I’m right there too 😂.

So I guess it would and wouldn’t surprise me if she earned some beads lol. Crazy though that like within a day she met the guy she’d be married to for over 20 years now. Thus the tagline on the shirt “some girls go wild, some find husbands lol.”

I've never been to the event but according to articles I've skimmed its supposed to be really busy but a great event. Music,  food, ect.  There's a children's ball drop around 8pm and a real one at midnight.  

If you Google it i think they posted more details on pcb's website...

To fly them like they do you will need a commercial license if you want to make money.  The R22 and r44 they have is just a easy to maintain bird.   200 a flight hour opposed to like a Huey which is 1000 an hour.  Best thing to do is get your private pilots in an single engine airplane and fly up and down the beach.  We have a lot of air space restrictions here in the Panama City area.  Single engine land is about half the cost of a helicopter private pilot and much easier to rent a plane than a helicopter.,t2_8u84drmg,No-Interaction1806,0,1638543838.0,0,t1_hn2o77z,hn2o77z,False,[deleted],t3_r80g9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/panamacitybeach/comments/r80g9l/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/panamacitybeach/comments/r80g9l/deleted_by_user/hn2o77z/,1,r/panamacitybeach,0,1

If it’s glassy calm, drop everything you’re doing and go to Saint Andrew’s. Snorkel out to the end of the jetty and back. It’s absolutely amazing to get out there into the deep water where there are corals growing down in the rocks below you. There are also a lot larger fish like you normally see in the shallows.

"That sounds terrifying.  You make it sound like he/she wants someone to lose their husband or kid and that is absolutely untrue.  One way or the other life is dangerous so we have to find the right balance between risk and safety.  That can be quite difficult to figure out because there infinite sources of fear, so government has to do it for you because they have done all the research and have to deal with it first hand as they know what is better for you when it comes to double red flags.  I'm learning my self as I never really inquired about the flag rules and just blindly followed them.  I'm sure it's not a perfect system and could probably be improved but again, I'm not an expert on this type of safety.

I appreciate your description it sounds a little incredible and very scary.  I've been going to the beach my whole life and have never experienced the type of rips you describe first hand and I hope I never do.

"Just as @savageotter stated, it’s the very strong undertow that gets people in trouble & also endangers the lives of the rescuer(s)  Our coastline sits at the apex of the Gulf of Mexico & with a shallow shelf that extends out more so than in other areas of the coastline. All of this combined causes these rip currents / undertow. 

Interesting fact…Mexico Beach in the Eastern most area of Bay County doesn’t have these rip currents due to where they are situated. However, this is where Hurricane Michael made landfall & obliterated the whole town. There is no, or not much, decent lodging so you’d have to make it a day trip.

"Heartbreaking update from the rescue

Nala update- The dreaded post that no parent ever wants to make. Part of Nalas body was recovered today. She’s been deceased since 8/6 (the day after the Malone’s started their adoption trial). 

I’m so sorry we failed to do our job and keep you safe as we promised u 2.5 years ago when we rescued you. I’m sorry your last moments u felt scared instead of loved. I’m sorry we weren’t there to hold your paw as you crossed over this life. Most of all I’m sorry there is monsters in this world that have no regard for life. YOUR LIFE MATTERED. And your life will continue to matter to us 

We will be pursuing both civil & criminal charges on the Malone family. What they did to Nala is to disturbing for details. I want to say thank you to Washington County PD & Chipley Animal Control for going above & beyond today & giving us the closure Nala deserved. 

Today 8/27 marks the end of this search but the beginning of a fight for justice. We will not rest until the Malone’s are held accountable for their actions. 

HUGE Thank You to ALL of YOU who took the time to share Nala & offer assistance. I know she would be amazed on how she made an entire world that seems to be so divided right now come together for one sole purpose. Never underestimate the power of love & unity 💕

‼️We will be putting together a Memorial for Nala near the Malone’s property so a day doesn’t go by that they don’t see Nalas contagious smile. If u would like to contribute or be apart of it please shoot us a DM and we will add u to the group‼️

As of today FBLR will be taking a pause on rescue. We want to focus solely on getting Nala the justice she deserves as well as the current dogs in our foster program.

"Diegos is a Chipotle Grill knockoff, your experience there will mimic Chipotle including the food.  Most, if not all, of the restaurants on the beach front, including Sharkeys, Runaway Island, Schooners, Harpoon Harrys, Margaritaville, Pompanos etc. are tourist oriented.  The food is good but not great.  They are on the beach and if that view is important there is very little difference between the lot.  Pineapple Willies is a good choice if you want very informal and on the beach.  They have a pier that goes out over the beach and its always interesting. And, like most of the other beachfront restaurants, its tourist oriented and the food is good but not great.   Salt Water Grill is the best restaurant on the beach in my opinion, great food at reasonable prices.  Firefly is high end with exceptional food but its really expensive, ditto Grand Marlin.

I haven't been back to Florida since Christmas so things could have changed but when there I was working from home and often went to The Pour. It has a large living room-like area with many tables and chairs so you don't feel rude for occupying a space for a long time. They also have a few tables outside so you can take in the view of the water. The only negative for me besides it closing relatively early (at 3 last winter; check current hours) was the number of people going to school online and working from there who didn't use headphones to contain their noise from everyone else. I just sat in my car to make / take calls. The Wifi was strong enough to work fine from the parking lot. And after the first visit I began bringing AirPods with noise cancellation to minimize the distraction caused by other customers.,t2_gla98e2,ClementineJane,0,1629229543.0,0,t1_h9bqilq,h9bqilq,True,AlarmingNectarine,t3_p630tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/panamacitybeach/comments/p630tm/best_place_to_get_work_done_while_on_vacation/,Best place to get work done while on vacation?,/r/panamacitybeach/comments/p630tm/best_place_to_get_work_done_while_on_vacation/h9bqilq/,4,r/panamacitybeach,0,4

>Based on the health criteria set by Resolution 20-114, the City has cancelled the remaining Summer Concert Series and is conditionally denying pending special event permits.  
On May 28, 2020, the Panama City Beach City Council approved Resolution 20-114, which set safety standards and protocols for the approval of special events, as it pertains to public health and safety related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
This resolution established certain standards for the approval of future special events, in part based on certain health criteria that included evidence of declining or flattened COVID-19 growth in Bay County, and evidence that county hospitals have adequate Intensive Care Unit (ICU) surge capacity.  
Unfortunately, the number of COVID-19 cases in our community continues to rise with an average of over 200 new cases diagnosed each day according to the Florida Department of Health. Many of these patients are in ICU beds in our local hospitals. At this time, an adequate number of ICU beds does not exist to meet the needs of our residents and visitors should we experience a crisis/surge of patients.  
Regretfully, this forces the cancellation of the remainder of the Summer Concerts Series scheduled for late summer and the denial of pending special event applications. This is a conditional cancellation and can be reversed if hospital conditions and other health criteria improve.  
City officials and staff will continue to monitor the numbers and revisit this issue as needed, as we remain committed to the safety and well-being of our residents, visitors, employees and the community as a whole.",t2_2jmwx,unrequited,0,1628535376.0,0,t1_h8bh3q7,h8bh3q7,True,unrequited,t3_p17vdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/panamacitybeach/comments/p17vdz/based_on_the_health_criteria_set_by_resolution/,"Based on the health criteria set by Resolution 20-114, the City has cancelled the remaining Summer Concert Series and is conditionally denying pending special event permits.",/r/panamacitybeach/comments/p17vdz/based_on_the_health_criteria_set_by_resolution/h8bh3q7/,1,r/panamacitybeach,0,1
