"Outstanding because for all the complaints that apartment management companies and landlords complain about deadbeat renters there are plenty of deadbeat property owners and apartment management companies in Indiana. I've seen my fair share of them when I was younger and less established and had to rent. I've seen the toxic mold that doesn't get fixed. I've had to call the health department about various issues dealing with health concerns in apartments including improper dryer ventilation, trash not being picked up and other health related matters. 

If anything there needs to be state based information regarding deadbeat slumlords and property management companies since the great state government of the The State of Indiana has some of the worst laws in America for people that are renters as well as having some of the worst labor laws in America being a pro-business state. All the while being a pro-business state for 3 decades has led Indiana from being 17th in the country in personal income to 38th now in 2022.

"Ah yes the fair and balanced propaganda supported by outfits like Fox News and Newsmax and One America News all from the right wing side including vast amounts of lies and outright propaganda. Of course, heartily approved by Vladimir Putin, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and countless other hypocrites posing as decent people. 

Of course grand poobah we will all bow down and worship you and worship your beliefs and thoughts like good little subservient types because you in your infinite wisdom must banish us uppity little peasants to some other location or state or forum because you can't handle the free swinging conservations and comments that are exhibited here. 

Like the other tyrants and bullies mentioned you are an authoritarian of the worst kind with no values, no beliefs just pushing your bullshit onto everyone else without any facts or figures or logic. Kind of like the Grand Orange Poobah of Mar-A-Lago and his 20,000 plus lies that were documented over 4 years. Strange enough I didn't bash our Capitol other than the cretins and soulless vipers that exist in that building who have bad faith and bad intentions and a great deal of hypocrisy. 

Not to mention a couple of our grifting public officials in state office including the last two Attorney General place mats in Indiana that were more interested in polishing their faux conservative credentials through whining and suing every measure of progress made by our government in charge through lawsuits against people getting decent healthcare for their medical needs, capping insulin at $35 dollars a vial, fighting COVID restrictions so more Hoosiers and more people can die of a disease that killed 1 million Americans already. Not to mention that it very well might mutate into another strain and reinfect more people. All the while these right to life bozos talk about life and liberty and pursuit of happiness and they're against abortion or this or that. Meanwhile they were perfectly okay with 22,000 Indiana residents dying of COVID already and they were perfectly okay with families suffering from lack of stable employment and incomes during the COVID. They always talk a nice game when it comes to right to life but when that fetus is born and becomes a child and then into an adult they're more interested in preserving the paychecks of the fat cats and corporate bosses and making sure big business gets welfare from the taxpayers than ever helping some kid or mom that needs food for their kids because their deadbeat daddy often runs off or can't keep a job.

"Poor little thing how are you going to deal with real life other than blow sunshine up someone's ass constantly. If anyone is negative its often the Indiana Republican Party and its desire to act as a ruling class over the people including those that voted for them. Not to mention their haphazard attempts at public policy including trying to dumb down education which they have done magnificently in your cases and millions of others. Add in the fact that Indiana at one time was 17th in the nation in personal income and now it is 38th in the nation in personal income. Add in the fact that wage growth over the past few decades under largely Republican policies has stagnated as evidenced by Indiana sliding down the economic scale to be just above that of the Southern states which have long been the poorest states in all of America. 

Since you don't have any real facts or figures or logic perhaps you can pick up some good books at our Carnegie donated libraries that were donated by money from Andrew Carnegie in quite a few Indiana towns and cities and use those books that some of our state representatives obviously haven't read. Not to mention the increasing number of poorly educated Hoosiers that wish to turn Indiana into some fiefdom of groupthink on a conservative/Christian level of the worst type. Nothing more different than trying to become a religious theocracy on the way to becoming a more theocratic nation like one would find in Iran. The only difference would be the level of technology and wealth in the United States built through industriousness over the generations. 

Not to mention the out and outright harassment of marginalized citizens that you obviously support like harassment of trans Americans and LGBTQ minorities as well as the disenfranchisement of African Americans who make up about 10 percent of all Indiana residents. Let's add in the fact that these yokels want to make Indiana schools as bad as the ones in the Southern United States along with the racial dog whistles, book banning and cultural wars over religious theology and the continual dumbing down of Indiana schools along with the paucity of science education that most of these fundamentalists and their fellow travelers would like to foist on the rest of us.

"It's absurd you just asked me ""what mentality"" when your response is just above mine. Did you blackout while you were furiously typing your response to u/MightyMouseIN?

Additionally, how do you not see the hypocrisy in your statements? You're so hell bent on scolding people for expressing their opinions about Indiana you think it's acceptable to tell them to leave. And yet you're acting the same exact way, complaining about what you see on Reddit, but clearly aren't willing to practice what you preach by just leaving if you don't like it. Curious indeed.

The Republicans who run the state do have a negative impact on this state, whether you believe it or not. What's worse though are the people who vote in those selfish, incompetent politicians who espouse the backwards thinking that caters to the lowest common denominator, restricts the freedoms of Hoosiers, and in part, stymies the progress of Americans.

How in the world do you implement change without addressing the issues? Telling people to get the fuck out is counter-productive and stupid.

"Jacksonville is correctly a ""shithole"" and I guess they were too scared to go there and get their vibe of that community. It's not a good vibe either and that's not counting their atrocious football team. Jacksonville reminds me of the worst of the deep south kind of like a big trailer park with mullets with a slightly nicer housing stock. Not to mention that dump is 20 miles from the city proper to the beach at least 20 miles from the central business district anyway. It was so bad in 2005 they had to pull up cruise ships and large passenger boats to have places to put tourists for the Super Bowl even though they knew it was going to happen years in advance.

It's like going back 20 or 30 years or some cases 50 to 75 years dealing with the Southern mentality.

Jacksonville is a hooter town on the banks of the St. John's River. The city is 20 miles from the ocean at least where the downtown part is and there's next to nothing there to do outside of maybe certain sports events and if you can stomach it a very terrible football team. They had to actually bring in cruise ships and boats to house people during the Super Bowl back about 2005 because they didn't have enough other reasons for anyone to want to go there.

"The Klan died in Indiana the day DC Stephenson was convicted of rape and murder.  That was 1925.  By 1926 the Indiana Klan membership had all but disappeared.  It was no longer a political machine.  The Ku Klu Klan was formed by Nathan Bedford Forrest, in Tennessee in 1865, Forrest was a white trash Lincoln hating democrat.  After 1870, Republican state governments in the South turned to Congress for help, resulting in the passage of three Enforcement Acts, the strongest of which was the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871. By 1872 the first Klan was dead.  It wasn't until 1915 the Ku Klux Klan saw a revival that began in Atlanta Georgia, and the flames were fueled by DW Griffith's move ""Birth of a Nation"" and the book ""The Clansman"" by Thomas Dixon that was originally published in 1905.  This is the second Klan.  NOTE the 2nd Klan did not exist until 43 years AFTER the original Klan was disbanded.  In 1924 the Klan has an estimated 4 million members, nation wide.  By 1926 there were less than 80,000, due to the arrest and conviction of leadership.  By 1940, due to the depression years, Klan membership dropped to virtually zero. The only time the Klan had major political influence over the state of Indiana was 1922-1924...Stephenson left the democrat party, formed another version of the Klan and helped to get Governor Edward Jackson elected.  When Jackson left the Statehouse in 1929 it was in shame, and his buddy DC Stephenson was sitting in prison.

I know the kind of people you're talking about and that's not me. 

I will push for harm reduction, but I'll also push people to wake up that the current milquetoast pro-capitalism, neoliberal, DNC strategies designed by Biden and Pelosi will result in a conservative resurgence. 

Make big changes that will result in better lives for upper middle to low income Americans. Do it now. Go all in. We don't have time for this crap. We've been getting GOP hypocrisy on the record since Reagan. They are shameless, they are spineless, they are destroying the country.

"April 1st 2022....also ironically April Fools's Day. This is an update. So yesterday on March 31st, Lt. Brett Keith, the official who handles citizen complaints on officers, advised me his investigation and report regarding the conduct of Officer Mike Miller was finished and that he could send it to me, but that he wanted me to answer some additional questions. I advised him I would only communicate in writing because I didn't accept his attempts to intimidate me or compel me to change my view of the situation. He had already been advised not to contact me again by phone and only be email just the day prior on March 30th, 2022.  So when he called me again on the morning of the 31st, I kept it very short and advised him I would only accept the report by email. I called back to the station and asked for his supervisor since Lt Keith seemed unwilling to send me the report to me until I spoke with him directly and I sent a follow-up email to Lt Keith reiterating that I would only accept a report by email. I was told over the phone that his supervisor was Major Johnathan Foster. I tried reaching his supervisor a couple of times during the day to get a copy of the report emailed. Lt. Keith wasn't sending it and Major Foster would not return my calls March 31st or April 1st. I have recordings of the voicemails I left for Major John Foster. They claimed my email wasn't working, so I decided to just show up and get a copy of the report. I called (while recording) a few minutes before 2ish this afternoon and advised I would be coming to get a copy of the report at the station. This is what the video shows. In total, it took roughly half an hour of talking and waiting to get a one page piece of paper that I will upload here, which indicates that the Carmel Police have deemed my report to be  a false complaint. Notably, the report only references the allegation of racial profiling. It says nothing regarding the allegations I listed on my complaint form about police harassment or any other categories I listed. Very curious. There was a lot of waiting time at the station and I brought a friend who lives in Carmel as a witness in case the department decided they didn't like all my questions. so I also cut out our in between conversations.  I want to thank everyone who has supported me in this. The fight is not over. I am not surprised they deemed the report to be false. I have filed reports in the past on officers and they never find wrongdoing. I simply did the report as a formality to build my case.

"I've lived in 8 states in cities of various sizes. I don't know what Generic means for everyone but I think it is comparable to cities of its size. With 800K, it has an arts district, it has trendy nightlife, it has a bad part of town, it has a ""riverwalk"", and it has open spaces.

When cities are bigger, they have more to do (Austin, Philly, Chicago). When they are smaller, they have a niche vibe (Denver, DC, Nashville).

Indianapolis is just big enough that it caters to everyone in some way but not as well as cities of different sizes.

I like Indy because it attracts big music acts at reasonable prices and I can fly anywhere from a cheap and convenient airport.

"Has anyone read the bill?

It does not cap the price of insulin. It caps what insurance can require for a co-pay. It also changes something in the Medicare Improvement act from $5M to over $9B. According to what I was looking at from CBO, it will add a lot to the deficit over the next 10 years.

I don't like either party, but at least understand what it was they were voting against. The bill does nothing for those that don't have insurance and it does nothing to keep the pharmaceutical companies from charging ridiculous prices. It also leaves those with HDHP's in an ambiguous state because it's silent on how those would address it. 

Having said that, there is another bill, HR 19, that is mostly co-sponsored by Republicans that also has insulin price caps, among other things. 

Please, don't buy into the media and just take things at face value. I've seen a lot of GOP members, alongside Democrats, decry insulin prices. So, I was surprised to read that most Republicans voted Nay, so I went to read the bill and immediately understood.

This bill does not cap insulin prices, it caps cost shares. It does nothing for those that don't have insurance, it increases the deficit (per CBO), and great increases money going towards the Medicare Improvement fund (which isn't necessarily bad, but an increase that size seems like it should be discussed more, not just jump like that.). The Republicans weren't necessarily against capping the price, but that's not what this doesn't.",t2_kmgqakoz,csf_2021,0,1648872153.0,0,t1_i32khpj,i32khpj,True,wyssaj01,t3_ttuv1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiana/comments/ttuv1z/all_indiana_house_representatives_voted_against_a/,All Indiana house representatives voted against a $35/month insulin price cap,/r/Indiana/comments/ttuv1z/all_indiana_house_representatives_voted_against_a/i32khpj/,6,r/Indiana,0,6

"Please, stop playing stupid Indiana.
It comes down to race.

Plain and simple. This state is ravished by the opit epidemic.
The number one demographic on opioids is WHITE.
This is treated as  an affliction to the individual, making opioid addiction  ""boutique"".

Oh, and these dirty cops can make money, too!

Cannabis goes back to the U.S. original sin: Amerindians.

Again, our federal laws have no power on their reservations. When we they leave reservations, U.S. jurisdiction kicks in.
United States has a loooooong history of banning even the use of sage(sage was banned until the 1978 passing of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act), as well as other herbs used in Native tradition. So the next time you Stacy's go ""smudging"" as your cultural heritage, recall that it was illegal for REAL natives to use.
Much like marijuana.
It was the white man's way of making it illegal to be anything but white.

Further, Black Americans(I check this box as well after providing my CDIB#) smoke marijuana at the same rate as white folks. But they seem to be arrested and convicted, CONVICTED more for it.

It's just easier to pull a black men over traveling in one of the smaller klandiana towns and say ""I smell weed"".


After all, there's no money to be made off the white viktums of the opioid ""epidemic"" but potheads go to work and live lives that are productive enough to make money off of.

That's one reason.

There's money to be made on the addiction. Government funding, dirty cops even get in on the hustle!

But go ahead, let the rest of the white folks in the comment do all sorts of mental gymnastics to provide you with a factitious political response.

There is no additional profit to be made by exporting.

"It does take two to make a baby, and it's great that your son doesn't want to be a deadbeat dad.  But stressing out the mother of his child during her pregnancy is probably not good for the baby.
