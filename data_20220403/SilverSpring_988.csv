In the over three years I have been here the elevators haven't been out of service. Once the fire department was inspecting them or something? So I did have to take the stairs down. I have also never waited more than a minute or two for an elevator. There are separate elevators for moving in/out and getting large furniture delivered so the main ones are never reserved for that or busy from it. But I think the only mid rise apartments downtown are summit hills (I also lived there)  and Falkland chase?,t2_4r8pvo9c,UtterlyNifty,0,1648953992.0,0,t1_i36encs,i36encs,False,WildVulture,t3_tsncvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/tsncvj/moving_to_silver_spring_from_nyc/,Moving to Silver Spring from NYC,/r/SilverSpring/comments/tsncvj/moving_to_silver_spring_from_nyc/i36encs/,1,r/SilverSpring,0,1

"Looking at your list, a friend lives in Lenox park and likes it although the unit you have listed is definitely not the townhouses. It’s a typical high rise apartment building with a row of townhouses at the back. They all are 3 bedroom I believe with a two-car garage. So very expensive and never available.

The Blairs also has “townhouse” buildings separate from the high rises with a ton of different floor plans. Some with garages but most typical apts between 1-3 bedrooms. I am in a 1 bedroom and love it. If you call/search their website, filter by “Towns” for available units. Looks like two one bedrooms are currently available. 

Also, steer clear of Summit Hills. Nickname is Slum-it Hills, price and sq ft seemed too good to be true and it was. I viewed a few apartments and they were all gross.

I second Falkland Chase. It’s by far the most dog friendly option in Silver Spring and much better value than any of the high rises.

"I strongly recommend Falkland Chase. My wife and I lived there for 2 years before buying our own place and we really enjoyed it. It’s not modern and there can be excessive humidity in some of the units, but those are the only downsides. The maintenance crew usually resolves issues within a day, it’s the cheapest around, lots of people stick around for years, it’s literally right next to the metro, it includes free parking (if you ever decided to buy a car), it’s surprisingly quiet, there’s lots of green space around the apartments, and the leasing office staff was always helpful and friendly.

"I rent a 1 bedroom at ""Arrive"" (formerly ""The Point""), and I will have lived here for two years once I move out in May. My rent is $1550/mo.

Overall, I would say the building is ""fine"". I rented a unit that was not upgraded (in other words, not painted over to look luxury, has carpet), but had a washer and dryer in unit. The luxury units are more expensive. The units without W/Ds are less expensive, and there are laundry rooms on every floor. 

While I do have some complaints, this did fit my plan perfectly. I moved into this apartment knowing that I would move out as soon as I could buy my own place. I wasn't trying to put down long term roots here so I was willing to forgive a lot of annoyances. 

Overall, I was happy renting here because I saved a ton of money with this place. It is walking distance to literally everything (doctor, barber, dentist, bank, gym), but most importantly my office, where I park in the office underground parking for free. So I saved money not having to rent a parking space in my apartment.

Because of those great benefits, I overlooked the fact that my apartment is hot. Seriously, it's just hot, year round. I am on the 11th floor facing south. It gets direct sunlight from sunrise to sunset and, in the winter months, the building's internal heat radiates upwards and adds to the heat. It was only intolerable for maybe one or two weeks in the early spring and late fall when the outside temperatures are still warm but the building is on heat (units do not control whether the AC or heat is on--the building decides that, you can only turn it on or off). 

My unit was definitely not luxury. But it wasn't a dump--it was ""fine"". It had carpeted everything, but the carpet was in good condition when I moved in. The cabinets all look straight out of the 90s and so does the bathroom. But again, I'm fine with all of that. 

Importantly, I had absolutely NO issues with bugs or vermin. No cockroaches, mice, or anything. I remember when I was apartment hunting I saw a lot of reviews online complaining about infestations. Maybe that's a problem on the lower floors but I had no issue up on the 11th where I am. 

I did leave for work one morning and found a homeless dude passed out in the hallway on my floor. I told the concierge immediately and it never happened again. The building does require a key fob to get in but he probably just followed someone else. 

So that's it. My experience renting a not-luxury apartment. Take it for what it's worth. It was perfectly fine for my particular purposes and I really have no complaints. I am glad to move out of downtown Silver Spring just because I do not like the noise and hustle of ""city"" living all day long. I can't wait to be able to leave the office and go home to a peaceful neighborhood. I will miss being able to walk to everything, but my office is still here so I can get that stuff done during breaks in the workday.",t2_4j329,thepulloutmethod,0,1648697487.0,0,t1_i2sz280,i2sz280,True,WildVulture,t3_tsncvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/tsncvj/moving_to_silver_spring_from_nyc/,Moving to Silver Spring from NYC,/r/SilverSpring/comments/tsncvj/moving_to_silver_spring_from_nyc/i2sz280/,3,r/SilverSpring,0,3

All of MoCo is pretty safe when compared to D.C. or Baltimore but crime does happen. I've lived in Silver Spring for 8 years and I've never been a victim of a crime but I have seen some small crimes happen discussed on my neighborhood listserv. Car break-ins and such. I once saw a car drive by with a woman screaming for help out of the window. I called the police but don't know what happened after that. A couple of very young girls were molested by a homeless guy not far from my house. Sometimes guys get drunk and high in a group in the woods near me and some women have told me they avoid going there because they get harassed. So it's not like there's nothing but it's not an especially *dangerous* place.

"We moved from DTSS to Glenmont not too long ago. It’s definitely a different vibe, but not necessarily in a bad way. It’s not super walkable. We had to adapt to driving more though the traffic is a lot less snarly here than it was in DTSS. 

The variety of restaurants and take out places is pretty different. (Though if you are up closer to the Leisure World area, Mannequin Pis in Olney just made Tom Sietsma’s 7 favorite places to eat list in WaPo earlier this month.) 

I do miss the WF, but the Rockville one is just 15 minutes or so down Randolph Rd, so that’s do-able. I’m not a Lidl fan (because the stock is more limited than your standard grocery store), but lots of people love it. There is also a nice farmers’ market in Olney that’s pretty easy to get to. 

Also, it is nice as hell to have easy access to 200 to move around the county (instead of the beltway or 29 like before).",t2_2tbs23r,vespertilio_rosso,0,1648484378.0,0,t1_i2gc90j,i2gc90j,True,yourexismean,t3_tpsgmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/tpsgmr/any_info_on_the_layhillleisure_world_area/,Any info on the Layhill/Leisure World area?,/r/SilverSpring/comments/tpsgmr/any_info_on_the_layhillleisure_world_area/i2gc90j/,1,r/SilverSpring,0,1

"I go to Kennedy HS. I'll tell you right now, our funding is really disapointing when you compare it to the W's in upcounty, like Whitman, Walter Johnson. We see those schools as the the richy richies. If you have the choice, don't live in the Aspen hill area surrounding Kennedy :,(

There's not much restaurant variety here, it's just kind of mid-level. 

I love my life but don't set up your life around Glenmont. We're all kinda lower-middle class. And Aspen Hill isn't a whole lot better.

We don't have a *whole lot* to walk to but when it comes to metro accessibility, it's great, with the Glenmont Station and the Red Line right there, and a ton of metro buses (Y7, Y8, Y2) go straight down Georgia Ave to hwy 200.

"My husband I just moved here and really like it. Not much different to add beyond what others have said. You can get to the bougie stuff pretty quickly by car but if you want massive privilege and wealth go to Bethesda/Chevy chase area. Downtown SS is pretty cool and more walkable, but also more expensive and smaller lots with areas of higher crime. We really like the layhill area, we have a decently sized house, and nice sized yard, and our neighborhood is very quiet and walkable and we’re a short drive to metro and 200 (which is a toll highway but is low traffic so it makes it super easy to get to work on time in the morning). Matthew Henson trail (basically a greenway) also runs through the area. There is a nice looking private school for ages 1 year-twelfth grade. Silver spring in general is very central so it’s easy to get to just about anywhere you want to go. I will say the surrounding shopping areas are a bit of an eyesore if you’re used to a more upscale area, but they’re perfectly fine, just old.

Silver Spring, like many areas surrounding DC is somewhat expensive for what it is, unless you find a rental/purchase gem. From reading some of your comments, I think you might like the area near Fenton and Wayne, or a little south from there.

"Not really worth the rental rates. Citron is $1818 - $2544 a month and it's competitive with DC area rates as well as Bethesda, MD rates but you get no space,  max is 1192 sq ft . The Blair's is further down Colesville Rd. & Blair Mills Rd. and nothing but good reviews but those prices are high as well.

The point I'm trying to make is that Downtown Silver Spring is a cool place to visit. Breweries, coffee shops, two movie theaters, a playhouse, new restaurants, a giant state-of-the-art library, DSW, H&M and a newly renovated Ellsworth Place. However if you cast your net a little wider you'll get more bang for your buck living wise by looking into neighboring areas like Colesville, Burtonsville, Beltsville, White Oak. If you want the city feel but a little further out I'd highly recommend Crown Gaithersburg off of I-200. Also there's new apartments in Wheaton off of Georgia Ave. by the mall and the Safeway which are worth checking out as well.

Another question is, where are you planning to work/commute to everyday? If within the Beltway, you're pretty much okay with going deeper into DC like the Columbia Heights area. If driving around I-495 to Northern, VA whatever you do, don't look here.

"I lived close to the metro for a few years.
Pros:
-Tons of great restaurants 
-The Filmore and AFI
- Three(!) amazing breweries 
-Close to tons of bus lines and the metro
-Metro ride into DC 
-Juniper Trailhead / Rock Creek Park in walking distance
-Grocery stores nearby
-Weekly farmer's market 

Cons
-Mostly families/ kind of boring if you're younger
- Metro area has a lot of pigeons, dead pigeons, bird shit, and a homeless white dude that would sometimes get aggressive
-Bridge with murals that is pretty but smells insanely strong of urine
-Loud dude with megaphone screaming about Jesus? for long periods of time right in the center of Downtown 
-if you have a car someone WILL smash the windows in for no reason. This happen multiple times, and I did not leave anything appealing on the seats.

"Ok. I think by now folks have given decent answers for DTSS specifically.

More generally, DTSS is good for Metro access if you're going into  DC. If you're commuting to outlying areas, be aware that the part of the DC beltway adjacent to Silver Spring is one of the more congested sections, especially during the evening rush hour. 

Also, while the same Metro (Red) line runs up the I-270 corridor to the North & West, it takes long time to get there since you're going all the way into the heart of DC and back out again. Eventually there's supposed to be another transit train (MD ""Purple line"") that will connect DTSS to  Bethesda, possibly shortening that particular rail commute. But between major project delays, and the open question of coordination between the MD-owned Purple line and the WMATA-run Metro line, it's not something I'd get too excited about just yet.",t2_4fqok,dcheesi,0,1647876784.0,0,t1_i1jhavb,i1jhavb,False,saving_theworld,t3_tjayrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/tjayrj/whats_it_like_to_live_in_silver_spring/,What's it like to live in Silver Spring?,/r/SilverSpring/comments/tjayrj/whats_it_like_to_live_in_silver_spring/i1jhavb/,4,r/SilverSpring,0,4

"DTSS or the surrounding burbs? Silver Spring is a little bit amorphous and feel differs by neighborhood.

I live in one of the neighborhoods a bit north of DTSS and love it. Access to all the amazing food, cultural events and major transit hubs is easy AND I can quickly get to local trails (NW Branch, Sligo Creek). The cafe scene in DTSS is low key among the best in the US. 

Carjackings are up as a regional issue and you can get some loud street races at night... But crime doesn't feel that worrisome considering it is a highly dense, transit accessible area near the core of a major metro area. I find people to be generally very friendly and helpful in all parts of Silver Spring (except in parking lots).

It is among the most culturally diverse places in the country, so definitely get to know your neighbors - chances are they are cooking something you've never heard of and it is delicious, plus they may have some wild political takes.",t2_dv4ylc07,absorberemitter,0,1647870120.0,0,t1_i1j1y00,i1j1y00,True,saving_theworld,t3_tjayrj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/tjayrj/whats_it_like_to_live_in_silver_spring/,What's it like to live in Silver Spring?,/r/SilverSpring/comments/tjayrj/whats_it_like_to_live_in_silver_spring/i1j1y00/,10,r/SilverSpring,0,10
"You might want to clarify where in Silver Spring you're referring to (if you know), as well as where you're coming from if you want a more tailored response. There's a fairly large area that has Silver Spring addresses, but the downtown area is just a small part of that total area. Are you talking about downtown Silver Spring or somewhere else?

Downtown Silver Spring has a fairly city-like atmosphere despite not even being an incorporated city. It's extremely walkable, tons of restaurants, really good brewery scene if that's your thing, and easy access to DC by train/bus/bike or virtually any mode of transportation. It's one of the best places in the area to live car-free because everything is so close by and the public transit is fairly good.

"Hey sorry for the late reply. You probably already finished your decision process, but here's what I can say:

It's my first time living in an apartment building, so I don't have a good frame of reference. I think it's been nice though I don't want to continue spending a ton of money to live here, so I might consider other options at the end of my lease. It's probably still one of the cheapest in comparison to other luxury Silver Spring apartments I'd imagine, so I can't call it expensive.

Staff are really friendly, people in the elevator are usually friendly. For your internet, you're forced to use Comcast Xfinity. Construction hasn't stopped so one of the nearby roads I would use has been closed for a while. Also the water pressure has gotten worse since the end of December and I'm not sure if they've done much about it in spite of the several maintenance requests they got. 

I've never had problems with roaches or loud noises from other people in the apartment (except one night when someone washed their laundry too late). I usually keep the windows closed when sleeping so the street noise doesn't wake me up. 

There you go, some random details that I threw together.

**FIRECRACKER EDICT ISSUED BY POLICE**

**Montgomery Arrests Will Follow Noises After 10 at Night.**

**COMPLAINTS ARE MANY**

Annoyed by repeated complaints that boys and men are exploding firecrackers and other fireworks in the residential sections or Bethesda and contiguous towns, Montgomery County police or the Bethesda Substation have issued an ultimatum. 

Any person caught exploding fireworks after 10 o'clock at night will be arrested and taken to police court, according to Sergt. Leroy Rodgers, in charge of the substation. They will be prosecuted under the provisions or section 118, article 27, Maryland code, which prohibits the making of unseemly noises to the disturbance of the public peace.


Numerous complaints rained upon the personnel of the substation and Sergt. Rodgers finally decided to take the matter before States' Attorney Robert B. Peter, Jr., at Rockville. State's Attorney Peter dug up the law and told the sergeant that arrests could be made. Sergt. Rodgers last night instructed the men of his command to be especially vigilant and to warn persons caught discharging firecrackers that they would be arrested if they persisted after 10 o'clock at night.


It is understood that the other precincts or the county police will follow suit if there is any need for it.

"Well, one suggestion is to sign up with Volunteer Match. You tell the system what you can do, what your interests are, and how much time you want to spend, and they send you lists of volunteer opportunities. There are many ways to help via a computer that don't require mobility.

Another idea is to take a look at the Meet Ups in the area. It's a bit like fishing: sometimes you get an old shoe, and every once in a while you pull up a rainbow trout. Same thing here: I've met some odd fish in Meetups, but I've also met some people with similar interests who have gone from stranger to acquaintance. Who knows what the future might bring? 

As for finding Meetup groups with people with similar interests and needs, that's something you can play with. I just did a tiny dig and found a DIY remote controlled and autonomous mobile robot group, all online, [here](https://www.meetup.com/GTA-Robotics/events/284060578).

"Metro is supposed to be fully accessible, although I know you know how varied ""accessible"" can be. Still, it's better than so many other transit agencies around the country.

If you can get to the downtown Metro office (which is between Gallery Place/Chinatown & Judiciary Square stops (like 1 block from either)), you can get a disability SmarTrip card that will only charge you half fare for any trips taken. If it applies, you can also sign up for MetroAccess, which is door-to-door transportation on-demand (although you have to request it days in advance).

These things together can help you get out more often, even if it's just to go to the doctor's or for a meal.

The library is usually accessible and is a place you can go w/o having to spend any money once you get there.

If you do have mental health challenges, there's the peer-run (that is: ""us helping us"") Silver Spring Wellness and Recovery Center (SSWRC) as part of the Santé group. It's just on the outskirts of downtown Silver Spring & it's a place to go where you can meet people & do things. (I used to go to the Santé group for my therapist & psychiatrist as well.

"Many people on disability can't do that because if they do, they lose their disability support (yes, even with volunteering too much because it ""proves"" you can work), and the job doesn't make up for what they lose. There are programs to help people w/ disabilities get jobs, but the federal ones require you to be able to hold down a full-time job (and many PwD can hold down a small job or be self-employed but not full-time) Even schooling can sometimes ""prove"" that you're ""well enough"" to have a job. People don't just lose their money, they can easily lose their housing too, as well as their insurance. (The system is NOT set up to provide a high quality of life for disabled people.)

Plus, everyone and their MOM is trying to find remote work right now. While it's common now, it's also in incredibly high demand.

Also if they don't have interest to work or volunteer, they may also have mental disabilities as well, like severe depression, which can keep them from being able to hold down a job.

THAT being said, there's a MD state program called EID, Employed Individuals with Disabilities, that, if you get a paying job (and it CAN be self-employment.  I'm not sure you even have to make enough to file a tax return, but then you have to submit different paperwork, because I just submitted my tax forms), then the state will give you Medicaid even when making up to like $50k or $75k, for a premium of $0-50 a month. (I made $350-400/month and had to pay $25 for my premium). So even if you do some kind of small task (like get someone's groceries, or babysit) or even make crafts or something & sell it on Etsy (even if you just sell like $1 worth a month), you can get Medicaid on top of whatever other insurance you have. (I had Original Medicare (Parts A, B & D) & used EID like a Medigap plan. It worked VERY well. I had to go into the hospital for a week once and I never even saw a bill. It covered EVERYTHING.)

"We take our dog to the silver spring animal hospital and don’t have any complaints.

Ellsworth is a pretty good dog park. It’s a bit small and weirdly shaped so it may not be the best depending on your dog. Like, when there are dogs my dog actually wants to play with there she will get lots of exercise, but it’s a bit harder to throw the ball if that’s how you want to tire out your pup. 

There is a dog park in Wheaton that’s only like a 15 minute drive and it is much bigger. That’s where I take our dog on the weekends when I really want to tire her out.

There is a great doggy day care on Georgia ave near silver spring ave back by the Guatemalan consulate that is very reasonably priced and doesn’t require booking ahead for daycare. A half day is 20 bucks, a full day is 32 IIRC. That’s much cheaper than the places I’ve seen elsewhere, and it’s family owned and operated which is pretty cool. 

If you are near downtown and like alcohol, fen wick beer and wine is a great dog friendly store and they always have treats and water for the dogs there.

"Yeah that does sound annoying. I’ve been thinking about this a lot since I commented, so sorry this is a little long winded.

Also the rule seems extreme even to the point that someone can’t play acoustic guitar out on the grass since it’s not allowed anywhere on the property. I wish there could be some middle ground but that would get messy I guess with noise complaints and such.

"This isn't a big deal in all honesty; it was redundant to have two Truist branches within about three blocks of each other in downtown Silver Spring.

Interesting fact: All of the ""Big Four"" banks (JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citibank) and four of the five ""Second Five\*"" banks (PNC, Truist, Capital One, and TD Bank) have branches in or within a mile of downtown Silver Spring.  If you include HSBC and M&T Bank, DTSS has branches (or is located close to branches) for 10 of the banks in the U.S. that have over $100 billion in assets.  There are few banks in the U.S. that meet that threshold (and some of those banks are investment-focused banks or credit-focused banks).

\*""Second Five"" banks is a name I personally use to identify U.S. Bank, PNC Bank, Truist, Capital One, and TD Bank as the five consumer-focused banks that are much smaller than the Big Four banks but much larger than all other consumer-focused banks in the U.S.",t2_4okecjul,FormerCollegeDJ,0,1646076707.0,0,t1_hytedxs,hytedxs,True,SourceOfTheSpring,t3_t3jk9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/t3jk9r/suntrust_bank_permanently_closed/,SunTrust Bank Permanently Closed,/r/SilverSpring/comments/t3jk9r/suntrust_bank_permanently_closed/hytedxs/,6,r/SilverSpring,0,6

"For the love of all that is holy, do not go with the Meyerson Group. We rented a townhouse under their management for less than a year and they are awful. I can’t imagine the homeowner was happy either - the house was vacant for a month or two between the previous tenants and us, and those lazy MFers didn’t actually, you know, manage the property during that time. When we moved in, the washing machine had been left closed so long that it was visibly (and irreparably) full of mold and it took them two months to replace it. We reported a leak in the main bathroom’s shower on move-in that they didn’t feel the need to fix until it was literally raining through the floor into the room below. And then we spent weeks with an enormous hole in the living room ceiling (through which we could see mold growing on the ceiling joists) while they shopped around for the cheapest repair company, and THEN their property “manager” couldn’t be bothered to babysit the contractors while they fixed the problem that his negligence caused. We had to take time off work to chaperone the strangers in our house (who then proceeded to close the hole on top of the mold without remediating).

Whew. Sorry for the rant. Clearly I’m still processing some shit over a year later.

"I rent a 1 bedroom at ""Arrive"" (formerly ""The Point""), and I will have lived here for two years once I move out in March.  My rent actually went DOWN from $1550/mo when I first signed in 2020 to $1350/mo.

Overall, I would say the building is ""fine"".  I rented a unit that was not upgraded (in other words, not painted over to look luxury), but had a washer and dryer in unit.  The luxury units are more expensive.  The units without W/Ds are less expensive, and there are laundry rooms on every floor. 

While I do have some complaints, this did fit my plan perfectly.  I moved into this apartment knowing that I would move out as soon as I could buy my own place.  I wasn't trying to put down long term roots here so I was willing to forgive a lot of annoyances. 

Overall, I was happy renting here because I saved a ton of money with this place.  It is walking distance to literally everything (doctor, barber, dentist, bank, gym), but most importantly my office, where I park in the office underground parking for free.  So I saved money not having to rent a parking space in my apartment.  Because of those great benefits, I overlooked the fact that my apartment is hot.  Seriously, it's just hot, year round.  I am on the 11th floor facing south.  It gets direct sunlight from sunrise to sunset and, in the winter months, the building's internal heat radiates upwards and adds to the heat.  It was only intolerable for maybe one or two weeks in the early spring and late fall when the outside temperatures are still warm but the building is on heat (units do not control whether the AC or heat is on--the building decides that, you can only turn it on or off). 

My unit was definitely not luxury.  But it wasn't a dump--it was ""fine"". It had carpeted everything, but the carpet was in good condition when I moved in.  The cabinets all look straight out of the 90s and so does the bathroom.  But again, I'm fine with all of that. 

Importantly, I had absolutely NO issues with bugs or vermin.  No cockroaches, mice, or anything.  I remember when I was apartment hunting I saw a lot of reviews online complaining about infestations.  Maybe that's a problem on the lower floors but I had no issue up on the 11th where I am. 

I did leave for work one morning and found a homeless dude passed out in the hallway on my floor.  I told the concierge immediately and it never happened again.  The building does require a key fob to get in but he probably just followed someone else. 

So that's it.  My experience renting a not-luxury apartment. Take it for what it's worth.  It was perfectly fine for my particular purposes and I really have no complaints.  I am glad to move out of downtown Silver Spring just because I do not like the noise and hustle of ""city"" living all day long.  I can't wait to be able to leave the office and go home to a peaceful neighborhood.  I will miss being able to walk to everything, but my office is still here so I can get that stuff done during breaks in the workday.",t2_16sjfj5u,supertranqui,0,1645472153.0,0,t1_hxvbaik,hxvbaik,True,lothh17,t3_swo49c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/swo49c/help_2022_best_downtown_silver_spring_apartments/,HELP 2022 Best Downtown Silver Spring Apartments,/r/SilverSpring/comments/swo49c/help_2022_best_downtown_silver_spring_apartments/hxvbaik/,2,r/SilverSpring,0,2

"I lived at 1200 East West and it wasn't great but maybe not enough to turn you off. All the ""high-end"" apartments in Maryland have their problems since the places cut corners, but the garbage disposal there literally backed up into my bathroom sink and flooded the bathroom with food. I had to convince them to be the one's the clean it. They originally said I should hire cleaners for the leftover gunk of what they couldn't get. They also increased rent about 100 bucks a year, and when I first moved there parking was only 100 and when I left it was 150, so they are not afraid to increase pricing so you need to make sure you can afford that. If you don't want it then lock into a longer lease. Overall everyone has a bad story about buildings in this area no matter where you go, and on the whole I never had issues with noises, the place was pretty quiet, parking is good and easy, area is very nice and safe, and the gym was super nice.

"Hey! I actually moved away from Silver Spring to Boston in the fall of 2021. Have good memories of Lenox Park overall. Not going to lie we had major cockroach problems for the first few days, had the apt. exterminator come and got some cockroach bait and it cleared up 75% within the first week, probably 95% after two weeks and then 100% after another week and never saw another bug the rest of the 12 months I lived there. Definitely the best value and great location once we got past that. I'm kind of thinking our apt. sat for a few weeks/months unoccupied before we got there and that's why we had an issue.

"Thanks for the detailed breakdown.  I managed to get quiet unit so far in Arlington. The last time I lived in Silver Spring I lived in a building where the only thing going for it was that I could not hear my neighbors.

"I lived there back when they were called Montgomery Gardens, from 2005-2013. The management at the time was the best I've ever had in my entire adult life, and I've rented from big and small companies for 20 years. I mean, they were GREAT. There were no roaches and like 1 rat once in 8 years? We occasionally got some ants, but I mean, everyone gets ants every now and then. Put out Terro, they went away.

Your noise WILL bleed through to your neighbors, no doubt about it. Not having carpet, you'll hear them upstairs all the time. They will hear you working. If you live in the apt closest to the tracks, the trains will shake your desk in your room.

If you don't own a car, it's a long 6 block walk to the Metro, uphill in the evening. Or a quarter mile walk from the buses.

You may also want to consider Summit Hills. Closer to the Metro, similar prices (I think), esp if you split a 3 bedroom. I lived there for 2 years (2016-2018) and each building has their own manager right inside the lobby (I loved ours), their maintenance was quick & thorough, no rats or roaches. We had noisy neighbors like once or 2x but they dealt with it quickly. (Had a lot of noise when they were renovating apartments near us.) The only major problem is if you don't own a car but you occasionally borrow or rent one, the parking situation is atrocious (they won't give you a pass but you'll have to fight for the few visitor spots near your building, and people too cheap to buy a 2nd parking spot will try to take them. If you don't mind a quarter mile walk to your car, there's a TON of parking at the bottom of the hill (or maybe you'll end up in the buildings there). (Oh, and the gates at the bottom of the hill and the 16th street side get locked at night, so it may be a long walk if you live in the wrong place.) I mean, personally, I hated living there, but that was in part because I had a TERRIBLE roommate & I had just come from living somewhere really swanky. But they're really all that's available in DTSS at that price range unless you want to rent a room in a house, and they have DO have amenities out the wazoo.

Honestly, there's not really such a thing as affordable housing without noise issues in the DC area, unless you like rent a room in someone's house or something. At least, not that I ever found in the 20 some years I lived in the area.",t2_3rew1,C4bl3Fl4m3,0,1643763592.0,0,t1_hv7nhf3,hv7nhf3,True,piccplayer,t3_si3lqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/si3lqc/looking_for_apartment/,Looking For Apartment,/r/SilverSpring/comments/si3lqc/looking_for_apartment/hv7nhf3/,3,r/SilverSpring,0,3

"What makes a person a public figure? There isn't specific guidance from reddit. However, in this instance it is clear to me that they are not a public figure. As appearing on fox news (from what I can tell, one time) does not make you a public figure. 

When I approached this I checked a few things in a moment:
1) Are they a politician, executive or spokesperson for a business, an important member of some clergy, or other public facing role  (no)
2) Do they have a large social media following (no, medium) 
3) Have they identified themselves as the person in the video (no)

"First, congratulations! I'm a few years out from the possibility of home ownership myself, and the competition is terrifying, so nice work finding a place you like that's within your budget!

I don't have much advice on what's good in White Oak, but I do have some thoughts about your general situation. 

It sounds like you're doing some mourning for the urban and walkabke life you've lived as a young adult in the DMV. Ultimately this is a very natural response to change and aging. You're on the precipice of a whole new stage of your life, with a clear marker that there was your life before this, and there will be your life after this moment. It's okay to be feeling some trepidation and going through a little grieving for your old self and lifestyle.

Trust yourself, though, that you had good reasons to make this change. What was it you were most looking forward to when you decided to shop for a home? What are the opportunities home ownership provides that aren't possible as a renter?

Focus on those positives to give yourself something to look forward to, rather than only thinking about what you're giving up. Are there any projects you can finally do now that you don't need to worry about getting your security deposit back? Are there any hobbies you've always wanted to try but never had the space? Do you want to be able to get as many pets as you want without having to get approved from your landlord? Will this home finally let you pursue any dreams of starting a family? Do you want to build a hedge maze and garden in your yard, or convert your basement into a dance studio/laster tag arena?

So yes, it sucks to not be able to walk to stores and the metro, BUT you're also gaining some amazing opportunities and taking your first steps on a new, exciting journey!",t2_5e6t28aq,elmic91,0,1643292680.0,0,t1_hufuqdk,hufuqdk,True,supertranqui,t3_sdju2a,https://www.reddit.com/r/SilverSpring/comments/sdju2a/just_bought_in_white_oak_looking_for_life/,Just bought in White Oak - looking for life suggestions.,/r/SilverSpring/comments/sdju2a/just_bought_in_white_oak_looking_for_life/hufuqdk/,4,r/SilverSpring,0,4

"Hi neighbor - I'm only a few miles away from you.

Yeah, the suburban lifestyle is a bit different than the urban one if that's what you're used to. I spend my evenings.... on reddit apparently. There's some night life in downtown SS and in Wheaton (or so I've been told - I'm middle aged, married, and boring so I don't go anywhere). 

I happen to love the northwest branch trail - you can take it all the way north to the ICC and all the way south to the mouth of the Anacostia. It's beautiful. The most scenic part is probably the area just south of 29 (it crosses under 29 right near the trader joe's). Speaking of the Anacostia, the Bladensburg waterfront park is cool, you can rent kayaks and canoes, and if you have your own there's a free boat launch.

There's Ice skating in wheaton and downtown SS, horse stables in Wheaton regional park, MLK regional park, YMCA, GSFC visitor's center, Kenilworth aquatic garden, Rocky Gorge Reservoir, AFI Silver Spring, and paint your own pottery in downtown SS.

Don't live in Summit Hills. It's really gone downhill since the giant management turnover. Everyone I know who lives here is just waiting out their lease and then leaving. 

Management has done super shitty things like lie about how long the construction on 8484 is going to take, send 2 year long leases when you asked for 1 year hoping you wouldn't open it and read it, and now they are implementing a utility fee that's not even based on how much utilities you actually used, but the average based on your apartment size and they wrapped that communication up in some environmentally conscious bullshit instead of the cashgrab it is.

"Adding on to other people's comments: (Note: I had to move away in 2018, so forgive me if my advice is a little dated.)

1. Definitely get into Ethiopian food while you're here. There's a million restaurants in the DC area, and a thousand in downtown Silver Spring. I'm sure everyone has their own idea of who has the best (I'd love to hear everyone's opinion) but the DC area has a huge Ethiopian population and downtown SS is basically Little Addis Ababa, so you're right in the heart of it.

If you've never had Ethiopian food before, start with a messob platter. And definitely try out raw kitfo if you eat meat. Ethiopian steak tartare, basically. It's one of my favorite foods of all time. And if you're veg/vegan, Ethiopian is perfect for you; their cuisine has a ton of veggie dishes (including ones with protein), they're all vegan (AFAIK), & totes delicious. You can even get a veggie messob platter.

2) Also, check out the various pollo joints (pollo-a-la-brassa). Rotisserie chicken, Peruvian style. I was partial to Crisp & Juicy, but I don't think I ever had bad pollo from any of the other ones. (I recommend with fried yucca root, maduros/sweet plantains, and a salad. Oh, and you're going to want extra dipping sauces, trust me.)

3) re: driving. As well as what everyone already said, don't forget about black ice. This happens when it's above freezing in the daytime & everything melts and then dips back below freezing at night and the previously wet roads can turn into sheets of hard-to-see ice if not properly treated. (The temp changes like that are common.)

4) The surface parking lot behind the Whole Foods in DTSS (Downtown Silver Spring) is a special circle of hell. Esp. if St. Michael the Archangel (next-door) is having services or an event. Avoid it if you can.

4.5) The same can be said about the parking lot at Trader Joe's/Shoppes at Burnt Mills up 29.

"The winding trail is Copperhead Run. Northwest Branch Trail stays down by the River (This is a fork of the Anacostia actually).

"And if you want to really torture yourself, check out the disc golf course in Germantown at Seneca Creek State Park.  It's world class.

If you like to hike or have a mountain bike, check out the Northwest Branch Trail.  There's a good trailhead at [Burnt Mills Park](https://montgomeryparks.org/parks-and-trails/burnt-mills-east-special-park/) by Trader Joes.  From there you can head southeast into PG County - stay up on the ridge for rolling up-and-down terrain, or there are sections where the old trail stays down by the creek.  Out-and-back from the parking lot to the PG line (where the trail becomes a paved bike path) is about 6-7 miles I believe.  If you want to keep going, once you get back to the parking lot, cross Colesville at the Trader Joes light and turn left to cross the creek again on the bridge - the trailhead to continue northwest is just past the bridge on the right.  You can go from there all the way to Wheaton Park, in classic stream valley trail.  Ups and downs, some fun rock gardens.  Another 6-7 miles out-and-back.  And there's even more to the north if you're feeling ambitious, but it takes a little bit of sidewalk to get to the northernmost section.

"Welcome (even if briefly) to the area! Main roads are generally maintained pretty well - if you aren't used to driving in the snow/ice just remember to drive slowly, don't hit brakes hard (this causes you to slide), and give yourself and others lots of room to stop! 

What part of SS are you going to be in?

For food I would check out:

* Charm Thai / Ruan Thai / Kin Da (if you want Thai and sushi)
* Santucci's (for am amazing Italian sub) / Filippo's Italian Specialties / Mamma Lucia / Olazzo
* Tbaar for boba tea and onigiri 
* Bob's Shanghai 66 (amazing dumplings)
* A&J restaurant for dim sum
* Sushi Jin / Ikura Sushi
* Parkway Deli (fantastic Jewish deli)
* Woodmore Pastry Shop (best jelly donut I've ever had) / Donut Run
* La Casita for pupusas (or any of the hundreds of pupusarias)
* Samantha's for Mexican 
* Mid-Atlantic Seafood for some great soul food
* Quarry House Tavern for bar food (get the Korean BBQ wings!)
* CSNY Pizza (close as you get to NY style here) / Roscoes (Neapolitan)
* Supreme BBQ and Auntea Boba
* Restaurant (?) in the Wheaton H-Mart for Korean (not sure what it's actually called lol)
* Bonchon for Korean Fried Chicken
* El Pollo Rico 
* Tastee Diner for breakfast
* Woodmore Market Beer and Wine
* Bottlegonia (wine/beer)
* Takoma Bev Co
* Brew Belly (if you want to make a trip to Olney - great food and beer selection)

For other fun/shopping, you can check out Pike and Rose, go to a concert at the Fillmore, Saturday farmers market downtown, Sligo Creek trail, Rock creek park, Billy Goat trail... and this isn't even including going into DC (which you should do because you are so close).


There are hundreds of other amazing places to eat/shop/have fun. I'm sure others will chime in.

We signed under Kettler, and WPC had no idea what our monthly rent was set to. We found out at the very end, their data had our rent listed at like half of what we had been paying all along. Of course they never reached out to inquire about abnormally large monthly payments! :)

"You know, I've lived in more apartments, across more states than I imagine most have (military). Candidly, I have PTSD and the circumstances are beginning to take a toll on my mental health. I find myself wearing earplugs for most of the day. My zoom calls are often punctuated with noise from the fitness studio below or construction activity. The evenings are no reprieve with the myriad of entertainment venues across the street. I have no agenda in saying that this is the most incompetent management I have ever seen.

The previous property manager was a paragon of professionalism. In my conversations with her, it became clear that WPC is a company perpetually hoisted by its own petard. Why lease space to a fitness studio in an almost entirely residential building and make no effort to mitigate the sound? That's actively hostile toward residents in my view.

Even as a layperson I know that commercial real estate is an entirely different ballgame. It is far more laissez-faire. I have on good authority that the reason for Kettler's release was that they mismanaged rent collection.
