"As a counterpoint, I'm in higher ed (so my perspective is a bit different):

> This smacks of blaming students for things out of their control.

I don't think she's trying to blame anyone. I do think she is being optimistic and a bit duplicitous saying that ""students are behind because of online learning"" and then saying that ""online learning is an option for students"". I've taught classes online since 2014. There are some who are well-suited to it and others who are not. The ones who are not have suffered the last few years for it.

> High schoolers generally don’t give a shit about things like The Grapes of Wrath because it is not relevant given its period and they don’t have the life experience to appreciate it (and similar works).

While it's a bit beside the point, I disagree that Grapes of Wrath in particular is not relevant (I'm in my mid 30s, and have lived through two very sharp economic downturns myself-- one which happened right when I was graduating college). High schoolers are beginning to experience another one right now.

To Pidgeon's point, I will corroborate that, among my students, I have seen an *unprecedented* inability to focus on basically anything. Phones were a problem before the pandemic, but students will often just give me the empty ""Zoom stare"" during class and seem almost incapable of making any contribution during class.

> I forget that people stop learning after high school.

You're making a strawman of her point here. She's not saying they will stop learning. She's saying that their minds are adaptable. The idea of ""catching up"" is maybe more pressing than you're allowing: the last few years, students have deferred going to college in pretty large numbers, and admissions at many schools is quite a bit more competitive than it used to be.

I agree that mental health should be a focus among schools. But instruction doesn't need to be deprioritized for it, and we'd be doing a disservice to students to continue to allow them to coast. (As an aside, I have students requesting large amounts of time off to deal with fairly small life issues. While I've always worked with students if life happens, the idea that you need a month off school to deal with a fairly minor life event is not practical.)

> So is she talking about making the school day longer?

The article's not super clear on this, but I don't think so-- she's proposing more of a study hall during the school day, sounds like.

> Or is she talking about the classic tried and true school method of “helping kids catch up” by intervention programs which remove them from other classes to focus on catching up, which ends up making them fall behind in the removed classes, and the cycle repeats?

Again, the article is not clear, but I assumed that she meant, going into the Fall 2022 semester, that there be a ""study hall"" built into the school day.

> Focus on their mental health.

Again, I agree, but every policy suggestion or demand I've seen from administration seems to be doing this by lowering expectations. Kids (as they are now), will not be fine, academically, unless we try to catch them back up.

">	“Whenever a student is quarantined or if some of the students are choosing to be remote, and even with this bus crisis, students who are at home have accessibility to the learning materials,” she explained. 

Which doesn’t mean it is actually accessible, that self or distance learning is effective for that particular student, or that they even have an appropriate environment. This smacks of blaming students for things out of their control. 


>Pidgeon said she’s even had to select different literature for her students to read because the pieces that are typically in the curriculum are ones her students either can’t comprehend or aren’t interested in.  

Yeah, I’m going to guess it is the latter not so much the former. High schoolers generally don’t give a shit about things like The Grapes of Wrath because it is not relevant given its period *and* they don’t have the life experience to appreciate it (and similar works). 


>	As teachers continue to adapt, Pidgeon wants her students to take accountability for their own futures. She says it’s not too late to catch up for those who are behind. 

They say this, yet GCS prioritizes the “gifted child” programs above all others. Even the term is enough to discourage typical students. I’ve heard as much from kids in even elementary school, let alone middle and high school who face much more social pressure and a sense of shame as they get left behind. And for what? So the school systems can empower kids to take control of their futures by burning them out? By forcing them to hate learning by emphasizing hyper specific literature simply because the authors are considered masters? 


>	“As of right now, I really think that the students can catch up…they’re young. Their minds are moldable. We have qualified teachers who are here delivering the instruction. They just have to take it in,” she said. 

I forget that people stop learning after high school. Our minds are as elastic as we want them to be. Certain things are easier while younger—such as learning a language, but plenty aren’t. I don’t know if it was intended, but a lot of these statements from her pile on pressure which isn’t health given, oh, I don’t know, everything?


>Pidgeon says that while the tutoring and learning hubs can be useful, she wants district leaders to consider designating an hour in the school day for students who are falling behind to catch up. 

Been there, done that. So is she talking about making the school day longer? Will power is a muscle, you can’t increase learning by increasing time spent. There is a practical limit. 

Or is she talking about the classic tried and true school method of “helping kids catch up” by intervention programs which remove them from other classes to focus on catching up, which ends up making them fall behind in the removed classes, and the cycle repeats?

"> People are offering $10k+ worth of money sight unseen. Money that is lost in almost all circumstances if the sale doesn’t go through for any reason.

Exactly right - and this is why it's terrible financial advice to encourage someone who cannot comfortably put down more than 3.5% ($5k on a $150k house) to enter today's market. They are gambling to lose *twice their down payment* in DD, with nothing to show for it.

If they can't absorb that loss, then they're contractually obligated to buy a home with north of $10k in necessary repairs. This is *especially* true of FHA loans, where buyers have lower confidence in the deal going through and so demand higher DD amounts.

Responsible real estate agents are currently putting this reality front-and-center for their prospective clients.

Consider that the US population was 209 million in 1970 -- it's 329 million now.

"Plenty of money has been spent on Grimsley over the years. 

In my opinion, the money was always spent in favor of a vocal and opinionated few. As an example, Grimsley's athletic fields were upgraded before the main building. Now that this bond is prioritizing learning facilities instead of fancy walkways or fields, there is this opposition. 

As someone who's been connected to this community for my entire life, this is fairly contrived by comparison. 

Not only are the plans NOT set in stone about where the new Kiser will go, they are using emotional board speeches, online petitions, and social media campaigns to convince community members that the plan is a conspiracy against the community, and board members haven't responded. They have, just not publicly and not in some sort of special meeting with this special interest group.

As someone who is running for office, you need to be aware that these obstructionists exist and they don't actually always speak for the community as a whole. 

The pool had a whole tragic history, but you are correct that it hadn't been used in years. It was condemned due to lack of upkeep.  That was political as well, with the county refusing to take over the burden from the city. The city even paid the county to take the building, and instead of refurbishing it, they tore it down and used the remaining funds on Smith's swim facility. 

You have to concede that the Brooks site isn't large enough for a middle school.

I'm also not quite sure that there aren't plans to rebuild the fields. 

Also, if the county ever considered a fifty year school improvement and growth plan instead of plugging holes in a sinking ship, those baseball and softball fields would have never been recently refurbished. Any money wasted isn't the current board's fault, but previous boards and county commissions who refuse to plan for the future. 

My children don't need great athletic fields. They need lead free and asbestos free classrooms. They deserve working air conditioning and heating systems that aren't older than my parents. They deserve classrooms designed for this century. Guilford County Schools has a constitutional obligation to provide an education and maintain facilities that help provide that education. Legally, the obligation lies in educational facilities, not the extracurricular activities. I say they follow their legal obligations.",t2_edkro,books4all,0,1648327508.0,0,t1_i28h7dq,i28h7dq,False,mobleygso,t3_tkxfaz,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tkxfaz/greensboro_parents_concerned_about_plans_for/,Greensboro parents concerned about plans for athletic fields,/r/gso/comments/tkxfaz/greensboro_parents_concerned_about_plans_for/i28h7dq/,2,r/gso,0,2

To be honest, the work load. I prepare for one short class. I repeat it all day.

"Politics definitely colors the situation, but I don’t think it’s contrived. For example, to my knowledge the Grimsley pool had been out of operation for years due to structural issues so it was not being used and the repairs weren’t considered worth it. 

This situation is different because we’d be demolishing existing functioning facilities only to rebuild them later (all while extending the life of the existing middle school, which the studies said actually should be demolished). 

Unfortunately the root cause here in my opinion is that Guilford County underinvested in facilities for years and now we have too many schools that need major repairs or replacement and at the same time are over capacity. Otherwise it might have been possible to rebuild the middle school on-site or transfer the students to neighboring schools with excess capacity. But all we can do now is file that under lessons learned!

I’m hoping folks can come together and find a quicker solution because what I’ve seen so far is speculation that the fields may be rebuilt somewhere else at some point with funds TBD.

"Country Park doesn’t let you drive there on the weekend cause the road is also a walking/running/biking path and even if it says it’s closed it’s just closed for cars. If you park at the military park and walk along the road next to the graveyard you will see a statue in the grass and that’s where the little trail to Country Park is, people typically walk through that area so if there’s people around you should see it. You can also park right in front of the statue but then you have to drive through the military park to leave (path is a 1 way for cars). It’s kinda a funky set up but once you do it once it’ll make more sense. Once you see the pond at Country Park turn right and follow the loop and you will see the dog park on the right in like 0.4 miles. Feel free to DM me if these don’t make sense or you go back and still can’t find it! :)

"Country Park is pretty much the main one. You can park at the Military Park and walk to it since you can’t drive there on the weekends. The fenced off area is pretty large and there are 2 sections (both big) I’ve never had a problem there but am also fairly vigilant and leave at the first sign of trouble. 

Another place is Doggos. It’s a bar and also an off leash dog park but definitely not nearly as big. It’s $10 to bring your dog in but people are free! They have inside and outside areas and a designated area with tennis balls if your dog is toy-friendly. There is a neuter/spay requirement if your dog is over 1 year old and a vaccination requirement for all dogs. They provide water for the dogs and have employees walking around and monitoring play and what not which I also like.

"Oh goodness, I'm starting to see more alumni, not current parents, share this on Grimsley Alumni Facebook groups. It's also being pushed pretty hard by the ""Take Back Our Schools"" group. 

This feels very contrived, like they need something to be upset about.

There were no rallies to save the pool that was demolished and displaced the swim team. There were no rallies to save the softball field when they demolished it initially to build a new track. 

A middle school can't fit on a site that was already too small for an elementary school. The other option of building Kiser next to the current Kiser site will disrupt Kiser's student learning and traffic patterns/parking, which are already terrible. 

Not to mention, their beef continues to be with Deborah Napper, who they politically disagree with.

Good food right there too - LPFS, Sticks and Stones, Emma Key's.

If you're a book person, you might check out Edward McKay too. There are some chairs where you can sit and read.

Lastly, if you don't mind a short drive (and don't drink so much that you can't get home) - Winston-Salem downtown seems a bit more interesting and lively than GSO downtown, generally.

Pig pounders is a cool spot, you can bring food from wherever and go sit at a bar/outside/inside and they have ping pong and jenga and some stuff like that. 

Most breweries and the like will have something for you to do (if you enjoy that scene) live music etc. 

Grasshopper games are really fun, there isn’t much of a social aspect like a bar but obviously there are a bunch of people around so you can try to chat it up or whatever. 

You could go bowling or hiking around a trail at lake Brandt or wherever. Again maybe not as socially targeted but they’re things you can do with/around other people to potentially make friends.

"I've lived here for a few years.... since mid-2015. I come from a place where the garbage is cleaned up by community service every week (so, it's effectively litter-free), sidewalks are ubiquitous, and the pot holes are cleared up.... Taxes pay for all of these services.

I don't know how bad our roads are on a national level..... but the litter is atrocious, IMO.... My poor car has to decide whether to run over a McDonald's Big Mac wrapper or a cardboard box. I *hate* pulling into a parking spot only to see it taken by someone's discarded Hardee's drink... I just want more sidewalks since I hate having to walk alongside the streets (or in the littered grass) just to get places. I will gladly help pay for them....

I remember when I initially moved to Greensboro, I was pleasantly surprised at how soon potholes were filled up. Nowadays, they can seem hit or miss. But I think they're cared for, mostly.

I do hate the skinny speed bumps, though. I swear, they ruined my muffler. Back in the city I moved from (Columbus, OH), the speed bumps are much wider/gradual and easier on cars. They still slow you down!

I think the road pavement here generally seems like good quality .... nice and smooth, usually... I am not knowledgable enough to judge the quality of tar or asphalt. :)

"Sorry, just saw this, I hope it's not too late......I had one done, a front tooth 5 years ago. My initial consult was with Lane and Associates on West Friendly. I felt rushed and coerced into a ""hurry up and get this done!"" atmosphere. Really a hard sell. I asked my dentist and found out that 3 employees from her office went to this guy: James Tanner. A much better experience, he did a fantastic job for about $600 less than the other group. I liked his whole approach of what to do better, too (temporary crown, not a flipper type of thing). I felt very confident in his abilities. Bonus points for the fact that he trained my dentist how to do crowns, so she was extra careful and precise since she knew he would be looking at her work, lol. I know he lists as a periodontist, but he does implants, too (or he did, 5 years ago!).

"Yes, I came across too harsh. I just have no patience for special interest obstructionists. 

This person is perpetuating this controversy. 

They have presented in front of the board of education, created social media posts around this issue to create hype, and somehow got their board of education speech posted on Facebook groups and a conservative YouTube channel. (Maybe they have an interest in running for office in the future?) Despite working and living in Raleigh, they still want a say as to what happens to children here.

I came across harshly, but I'm just trying to advocate for children and teachers in the community who attend and work at these broken down schools, the same ones I attended decades ago. We've lost teachers to cancer from the asbestos in Grimsley's main building, yet so many improvements have gone to the athletic facilities by comparison. 

Any plan that doesn't include using the baseball and softball fields, at least in part, will cost our community millions of additional funds and a delay in capital improvements. We have 70,000 students across the district with probably about 80% of them directly benefiting from this bond. There are maybe 80 students whose extracurricular activities might be impacted by the demolition of these fields. 

They'll still have teams, but will have to practice and play off campus, just like the swim team when the county didn't upgrade Grimsley's pool and instead demolished the building. The softball field had already been moved once recently from its original location which is now home to a new track.",t2_edkro,books4all,0,1647874478.0,0,t1_i1jbrb9,i1jbrb9,False,mobleygso,t3_tgk8a4,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tgk8a4/this_is_the_worst_that_we_have_seen_grimsley_high/,‘This is the worst that we have seen’; Grimsley High School tour highlights need for repairs,/r/gso/comments/tgk8a4/this_is_the_worst_that_we_have_seen_grimsley_high/i1jbrb9/,1,r/gso,0,1

"Because traffic through an area like downtown is relatively predictable, relatively high, and speed limits are low - so lights are going to cycle relatively frequently no matter what, a sensor just doesn't provide a lot of value in those conditions.

Sensors are originally more for a situation like a low traffic side road turning onto a divided highway. You don't want to have to periodically stop the highway just because a car might be there and it's been a while, so the sensor is much more beneficial.

As costs have come down they've moved into more intersections that are in the grey area between these scenarios, but that wouldn't have applied to the downtown lights due to age - and since again there's not a lot of benefit they're unlikely to be retrofitted due to cost. Even if they were, you can't just have the sensors running the show during normal/heavy traffic, light changes would be far too frequent/inefficient. Once saturated the timing limits for the sensors are hit and it'd fall back into a similar schedule it has now. This means really the sensors are mostly only beneficial during low traffic/nighttime - so even less motivation to justify funding, which usually goes towards solving congestion/hotspots.",t2_f4ytr8w,Ben2018,0,1647865365.0,0,t1_i1iswhe,i1iswhe,True,RadioRough,t3_tijzpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/gso/comments/tijzpa/traffic_lights/,Traffic Lights,/r/gso/comments/tijzpa/traffic_lights/i1iswhe/,2,r/gso,0,2

"Absolutely. People complain about traffic here, and yes, wendover sucks most of the time, 40 will get busy around rush hour, I avoid death valley at certain times, but I literally refuse to drive on I-77 in Charlotte because of how dangerous and literally insane everyone is on it. I will take a different route through whatever crowded roads go directly through downtown rather than put up with that mess. Taking providence road into the city at anytime other than 10pm, yea, that's a mess too, although it always moves. Anywhere in any of the Charlotte sprawl is just busy constantly. Greensboro really has nothing on Charlotte for traffic and I am SO thankful. Maybe in another twenty years, but like you said, it's so easy to get in and out of downtown to visit, to see a show, to just hang out.

"Experience in different cities really has driven home how huge the ""ease of access"" thing is. I feel like a lot of people only focus on how many attractions or events a place offers while overlooking the logistics involved. Like cool, you're going to X event. How bad will traffic be? Will the parking garages be full? How far we will have to walk? What about getting home afterwards? Will we be stuck in a parking deck for an hour afterwards trying to get out?

Those details add up. We went to see Wicked at the Tanger Center last year and left really early, not sure what to expect with traffic and parking. Took us ten minutes to get downtown with minimal traffic, drove straight into Church Street Parking Deck and paid $10 right at the entrance, walked five minutes past beautiful LeBauer Park lit up for the night and full of families having fun and eating dinner. And then afterwards drove right out of the deck with no delay. Zero stress, zero hassle.

You are a young twenty something who went to NCSU and presumably graduated with a BS in Human Resources and BA in Film Studies. I'm not even sure you understand how large a middle school needs to be or what needs to happen to improve our schools. 

Baseball and softball aren't a big enough deal for me to deprive our entire community of a quality education in the best environment possible. This bond does that.

You and others took a look at the site? What was the land area of the current Brooks site as compared to the current Kiser site? Did your group take into account traffic flow and parking, which Kiser is already lacking? Putting the site further back on the property allows for a larger, more appropriately sized school building, appropriate amounts of parking, and increased efficiency in traffic flow. With the placement of Jamieson stadium, the best place for this is the baseball and softball fields. 


You are depriving MORE students by withholding the funding and being unreasonable. In fact, you are holding ALL of the students hostage in many of the GCS schools for your one child who plays a particular sport.
