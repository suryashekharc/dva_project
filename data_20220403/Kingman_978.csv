"From my understanding, it's based on Federal air quality standards.

Why Emissions Testing is Required  
Vehicle emissions testing is required in major metropolitan areas that are not meeting federal air quality standards for ozone and other pollutants. In Arizona, testing is required in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. The American Lung Association‚Äôs State of the Air 2021 report ranked the Phoenix metropolitan area the 5th most polluted in the country for ozone and the 8th most polluted for small particulate matter (PM2.5). The Phoenix and Tucson areas both received an ""F"" for ozone pollution. The Phoenix area also received a failing grade for small particulate matter pollution. Particulate matter pollution is made up of tiny pieces of solids or liquids suspended in the air. Vehicles contribute to this type of pollution, as well as ozone pollution.

[http://www.myazcar.com/](http://www.myazcar.com/)

I get what you're saying though. Even if you're not exceeding the Federal standards, there's still a public health benefit to reducing pollution, especially during fire season and monsoon when dust and smoke levels are high.

Our health has improved significantly since leaving a heavily polluted area and moving here. I came across this article a year before we moved that helped me track down some unexplained health problems we were having:

"We moved here 2 years ago after trying to figure out how to do it for several years. We discovered Kingman when visiting my sister in Scottsdale. The opportunity finally presented itself when I was able to negotiate working remotely on the condition that I am available to report to an office a couple times a year. If I had waited another year my job would have just let me go remote, no questions asked. lol I figured it might be easier to transition into a business or some type of investment if I had a stable job to start from.

I think largely education is what you make of it. Coming from the city that had better funding, the programs were also more rigorous and had ridiculous amounts of homework. The high school here doesn't have enough books for everyone to take them home, so for this year at least my freshman doesn't have homework. That allows him time to pursue other interests to prepare for college. I have 2 other kids on IEPs that are going to be moving off of them soon. The special education department is pretty good, and my wife works there also. Mohave Community College has the lowest cost per credit hour of any of the junior colleges in the state at $81. 

There's no requirement for emissions testing / certification for vehicles here, so that is a plus if you're coming from a city. You also have the option to register multiple years at a time, up to 5.

The pace of life here is very relaxed. That can be good and bad. It's tough trying to get people to call you back and keep appointments for things like landscaping and handyman type work. People are also really friendly in public though and seem warm and genuine.

There's a lot of potential in the area for starting businesses and building up the community. Especially with all of the work-from-home transplants coming to the area with good jobs. It's a very charming area and the overall vibe reminds me a lot of the pacific northwest, especially along the Colorado river in Bullhead and Lake Havasu.

"Well, I don't know exactly what you are looking to spend and such. Golden Valley isn't really my favorite place as it is a lot of trailers and prebuilts but there are some parts of it where there are nice little housing areas. It is certainly pretty reasonable so if you are after more land and want to spend a bit less, it is an option. Getting into town from that direction can be a bit of a pain at times due to the traffic from Vegas going into I-40 but that will hopefully get better in the future with the I-11 build. A little on the north side of Golden Valley off of Chea Dr there are some houses tucked up into those hills that are kind of cool.

if you are wanting more land and rural, Valle Vista to the north of Kingman tends to have slightly lower prices and its not bad. It is only about 10-15 minutes out of Kingman. Bad side is the internet options suck but that's pretty much the same in Golden Valley. Better options are coming in that regard, though.

On the northwest side of Kingman, off of Stockton Hill Rd and Potter Ave (Scotty Dr, Christy Dr, etc) there are some cool homes and those are all sitting on close to half acre lots. Kind of feels rural without actually BEING too rural.

If you are into older homes, the downtown area has some really cool ones but they generally have very little land and are a bit on the pricey side. Some cool shops and stuff downtown so having all of that within walking distance is kind of fun.

The homes between Gordon Dr and Northern Ave tend to have bigger lots but the quality and price of the homes there can vary quite a bit.

Going up Hualapai Mountain Road towards the Hualapai Mountains, there are some cool housing areas but that would be much more pricey obviously. Still, I'd check the area out as there are some pretty cool houses to the north of Hualapai Mtn Road and south of the interstate.

&#x200B;

I can give some more pointers but if you can narrow down kind of what you are looking for, that would certainly help. Kingman has a lot of areas that vary quite a bit both in price and looks so I could probably sit here all day explaining what I think. :)

Edit: Just realized how many times I said ""really cool."" Please forgive my apparent lack of vocabulary today.

"We bought a house just southeast of Route 66 and the interstate and are moving there shortly! We are new to AZ and new to small towns, but excited for the change. I‚Äôve heard so many differing opinions from different people about Kingman, but there‚Äôs enough that love it that we plan to hang out with them and leave the haters to hate on their own. 

There‚Äôs definitely a shortage of amenities, particularly for young families. As an entrepreneur I hope to change that, despite those who say it‚Äôs hopeless. There‚Äôs a fair amount of people who don‚Äôt want change, and a fair amount of people who want healthy change. I‚Äôve not heard of anyone that wants more liberal politics. 

Of course affordability is key, but we found that butler and new Kingman on the north is overpriced, Golden Valley is underdeveloped (like, Golden Valley is to Kingman like Kingman is to Bullhead City). And the southern border is wealthier. 

If anything, my perception so far is that Kingman is the promised land of opportunity, but many people there aren‚Äôt interested in taking life by the horns, they‚Äôd rather be comfortably miserable.

"Kingman is fine. Like anywhere, it has good people and bad people. There is a nice community here if you are going to take part in it. If you are a shut in then it is basically like anywhere else.

The schools are fine. Everyone hates on public schools where they live but ours are fine. I've went through them, I've worked for them, and I've got kids going through them. I've got very few complaints. 

Close drive to Vegas if you want to do specialty shopping, fly out, go to shows, etc.

Housing costs have been rising but that is happening everywhere. 

A lot of people say it is boring here but that really depends on what you are in to. If you like off-roading and hiking then there is a LOT to see. The desert can be a really beautiful place. Someone else here mentioned wind and they are spot on there. The wind here can get really crazy at times and it is blowing more often than not. 

Overall, for me... it is home. I've left many times and been all over the world and I always come back. People on here will always find negative things to say but you'll find that anywhere you go. I was in Hawaii a couple years ago and we ran into a girl that had just done our ziplining earlier in the day. We asked her how she liked living there. She made a funny face and said ""It is really boring here.""  My girlfriend and I were like.... WHAAAT?!

So if you are the kind of person that can find good things wherever you are you will probably really like it here and you may even find some really fucking awesome people.",t2_z2249fr,Funlovinghater,0,1644608638.0,0,t1_hwjom8r,hwjom8r,True,Vast_Aside,t3_spiecr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingman/comments/spiecr/looking_to_possibly_move_to_kingman/,Looking to possibly move to Kingman,/r/Kingman/comments/spiecr/looking_to_possibly_move_to_kingman/hwjom8r/,5,r/Kingman,0,5
"I would have to ask why you are moving. It isn't a great place to raise kids - the schools are bad and getting worse thanks to Arizona's Trumptard Republicans sucking all of the funding out of it. There isn't much to do for kids except school or club sports. If you don't care about their education and just want to indoctrinate them into a religous cult, there's a couple of private schools in town. The town also has very high rates of teen pregnancy and drug use. 

The weather is really nice. It is windy a lot, but the temperatures are good, it doesn't get too cold for long, and the heat is manageable. The fact that we have no bug season like back east is nice. 

The cost of living is pretty low, but there's also almost no places to rent, very few jobs, and the housing prices are getting worse. And as others said, if you want to shop anywhere except WalMart you have to make a trip. 

The best thing to say about Kingman is that it's close to a lot of other things. Close to the Canyon, close to Vegas, close to SoCal without havig to live in Cali. Flagstaff is a few hours drive.

"My husband and I moved here from NY because his mother wanted him to live nearby. She sold us this house( she worked for B. Ricca) She failed to tell us the certificate of occupancy was issued and we had 10 days to close. We wound up with $3000 in fines. She never gave us her commission as she'd promised.
Fast forward to 2011 when she convinced us I should take early retirement.
If we all went out we paid. On holidays we were either at our house or we brought the meal to her.
Christmas 2019 she wanted us all to go to Golden Corral but it rained and she doesn't drive in the rain. She said no we shouldn't go there to visit them.
We last spoke to her on New Year's Eve, she didn't take our calls, wouldn't open the door.

It turned out she cleaned out the house and moved, who knows to where.She told the listing agent people were stealing from her. 

So she made us move here and then dumps us like some leftover garbage in a place I hate.

"There is very strong sentiment in Kingman to ensure that it stays as close to how it was in 1980 as possible. There are a few families that own a lot of the land around here and they work very hard to ensure that their financial interests are protected. 

I also know some old timers who are still pissed that the town was forced to take down its Sundown Town billboard back in the 70s.

Back in the mid 2000s one of our City officials was asked about bringing in new stuff for youth to do. Their response was ""perhaps we can allow a miniature golf place for the boys to take their girls, and maybe a place for girls to buy ribbons for their hair.""

That is just how fucking backwards the town leadership is. And, just like with a lot of things in this country, until the old guard finally dies off there isn't a whole lot we can do to fix it.

Best decision we could have made for us.

These are on average $900k homes that have homeless camping around the neighborhoods and hanging out in the developer built parks.  Metro is only good for harassing people that can pay fines.

My advice to anyone: If you really don't like where you live, push hard and put in the effort to figure out how to move.  It's usually not easy, I was stuck in the SF area for a long time.

"There was a lot of opposition against the Wal-Mart and Home Depot in Kingman before being built as (from what I've been told) there were people on the city council who had shares in the local business and were trying to protect them. Yet, these major chain stores offer more jobs than the small business in Kingman. The Wal-Mart is the busiest place in town. Hell, that's where the kids hang out. It's their ""mall""...

Kingman has the potential to grow into a small town living community being near two major metropolis (Vegas and Phoenix). As more jobs become hybrids of remote/ office job, I think you'll see people move to Kingman/Bullhead and work in Vegas or Phoenix. If the state could get on finish I-11, that'll speed things up for sure. 

As for stores like Target, the story I've been told is we don't have the population to attract it. When Target arrived to Bullhead City, they calculated the population of Fort Mohave, Mohave Valley, Needles, and Laughlin would shop there. When they survey Kingman, they only looked into the population of Kingman/ Golden Valley. They did not take into consideration the rural communities of Valle Vista, Dolan Springs, Hackberry/ Valentine, Peach Spring, Hyde Park Rd, and Seligman. All are communities that shop in Kingman.

"A pear or egg shaped( Thing ) Black in color . It was  (Flying ) Heading south.......looking west from let's say  KRMC hospital .

It had in tow what looked like a metal beam that was dangling straight down as it flew across the landscape. 

It was lower than the top of the hills that you see looking to the west  from any spot on Stockton Hill.

It was very clear out and was 545am Spring 2019 I want to say...There were Cars 4 sale that were brand into the parking lot for some big sale at the time.

There was a trailer that perhaps had a person in it as security for the autos that were brang in. I drove over and

Was checking out the cars for sale when I seen the WTFlock is that...

I looked around fast to point and tell anyone ( LOOK) over there but

No one was out and about...No cars driving by at that second. I later seen the guy who was delivering the daily newspapers as it said the Miner on the vehicle.

He said no one said anything to him....

It was very bizarre looking and what explanation could have there been....What ever it was , It looked like they were transporting something

To use for building something...I can't even guess.

The UFO wasn't going fast at all..If even a car drove near me I would have had time to jump out in front of them and got them to look But even then.

Who gonna stop for a person waving to stop..At the same time then ufo would have had to have crossed th 40 freeway, And if someone going east or west right then may have seen the thing

But they would have been going faster that that flying thing..Someone else had to have be awake and alert enough that day ....Who was set up selling used cars in the lot next to taco bell that week..

That would give you a time frame as what week it was that day and year in Later 2018 or Early 2019..

If there was never anyone selling lots of cars inthe  parking lot  next to taco bell on stockton...Then I must not of seen a UFO..But if people had brought cars into the parking lot that week to sell

"At the risk of upsetting people, I'll give it a go.

As you can see in the comments; some locals get agitated when this is brought up repeatedly. We know that this video is not an accurate representation of ourselves and we'd like to think that our neighbors are better than the people in the video too.

Before seeing /u/umlaut's comment, I didn't know that the video was filmed in Bullhead, but it doesn't honestly matter whether it was filmed in Kingman or Bullhead. Let's be honest, the demographics are very similar between the two cities. A lot of us live in one city and work in the other so we call both places home. So let's talk about Mohave County as a whole and not one particular city. We'll start by looking at the demographics a little bit:

* [Mohave County is roughly 90% white](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0500000US04015). Being white doesn't make a person racist, obviously, but this is important to understand because there are people here who have honestly not been exposed to other cultures in a meaningful way. Or in some cases, their only meaningful exposure to other cultures came as a result of being sent to war.
* [14.5% of Mohave County's population consists of veterans](https://www.livestories.com/statistics/arizona/veteran-demographics). That may not seem significant, but it is higher than the percentage of veterans that you see in more populated counties like Coconino (6.5%), Maricopa (7.9%), and Pima (10.9%).
* The [median age in Mohave County is 51.6](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0500000US04015) while the median age in the US is 38.1. A lot of people come here to retire, so our population is older in general.
* Mohave County, as a whole, has an issue with educational attainment. [Less than 13% of the people who live here have a Bachelor's degree or higher](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0500000US04015). Having or not having a college degree does not indicate that someone is or isn't intelligent and it also doesn't make them a good or bad person. But a lack of quality education can seriously limit someone's perspective and they may also have underdeveloped critical thinking skills. That said, we also have to realize that with a lot of our population coming from older generations; a lot of these folks didn't go to college because they went to war or straight into the workforce.
* [Mohave County skews Republican](https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/State_Voter_Registration_January_2021.pdf). I am including this not as a generalization of a particular political party; just a statement of the demographics in Mohave County. Let's round and simplify the numbers to give you a clearer picture. If you grabbed 100 registered Mohave County voters (as of January 2021), you would find 52 republicans, 16 democrats, 31 independent voters, and 1 libertarian. [The *ONLY* visit that Mohave County has ever had from a sitting president was Donald Trump in 2020](https://www.havasunews.com/news/trump-s-rally-today-in-bullhead-city-is-first-known-mohave-county-visit-by-a/article_3263cf46-18e5-11eb-9178-236720c74851.html).

What does that all say about us? We're older, white, conservative, uneducated, and many of us are veterans or are close to people who are veterans. I don't identify with all of those labels, but I am choosing to say ""us"" and ""we"" because this is still our community, and to be perfectly honest, I am so tired of the divisiveness. That said, some of the things that I just listed about our home allow racist/ignorant people to feel more ""comfortable"" here than they would elsewhere.

Obviously, not every older white conservative is a racist. In most groups, there are extremists. Extremists do not represent the average person from the group, but they can make the whole group look bad when the extremists are presented as normal everyday people from that group. That's what I feel is going on in the video. They cherry-picked people to feature who would play into their narrative (look at these small-town morons! Haha so funny!), and the video was edited to feature the worst of what was said.

I can acknowledge that ignorant/racist people exist in Mohave County. Given our county's demographics; I can also acknowledge that it is likely that we have a higher percentage of ignorant/racist people here than places with a more educated/diverse population. But I refuse to play into the narrative that we're all racist morons. **There are too many people in this community who are working hard and trying to foster an environment of inclusiveness and cultural awareness for us to let this stupid video represent us.**",t2_4tpat,wiseblueberry,0,1619406897.0,0,t1_gvw2e78,gvw2e78,True,SexLifeEqualsNull,t3_mxwuqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingman/comments/mxwuqx/damn/,Damn,/r/Kingman/comments/mxwuqx/damn/gvw2e78/,9,r/Kingman,0,9

Just like those idiots from Australia when the skit first aired and just like every other asshole from Vegas/Phoenix who come here to say Kingman is a shithole.

The skit was made 4 years ago by a shock comic, who hand picked specific people based on them answering a Craiglist post.  Said comic then took his minions to BULLHEAD CITY and put on a presentation in BULLHEAD CITY using the BULLHEAD CITY Safeway in his pictures that were clearly meant to elicit a very specific reaction from very specific people for TV ratings.  When the piece aired he name dropped Kingman Arizona.  

I've asked questions before, the same thing happens.  Why don't you do that exact thing, next time some out of towner watches a Youtube/Showtime piece and puts on their keyboard warrior outfit to come here to talk shit YOU ask them!

" They actually shot that segment in Bullhead City at a space rented in the Bullhead Realtors association, about 30 miles away from Kingman. The flyer they show in the beginning of the segment says that the meeting is in the Kingman Library, but that is not a meeting room in the Kingman Library. A few of the people in attendance were bussed in from Kingman, but most were local from Bullhead recruited by a production company on Craigslist.

There was an article about it long before the episode released here because people were so suspicious of it:

"Another story - https://kdminer.com/news/2021/mar/01/city-kingman-suffers-cyber-attack/

KINGMAN ‚Äì The City of Kingman became aware Friday, Feb. 26 that its entire computer system had been targeted in a cyber attack, currently leaving the city with no access to email.

City Public Information Officer Coleen Haines said it is unknown at this time whether customers‚Äô information is at risk with the cyber attack.

The city wrote in a news release that departments can still work with customers over the phone and in-person, just not through email. Kingman Municipal Court operations are not effected.

‚ÄúSome operations will be manual only, and some operations will not be able to be completed until systems are back up and running,‚Äù the city wrote. ‚ÄúAt this point it is unknown when all systems will be fully functional. Once again, municipal court is unaffected.‚Äù

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security and the Arizona National Guard Cyber Joint Task Force, under the Department of Emergency Management and Military Affairs, has been working with the city on the issue. The Arizona National Guard Cyber Joint Task Force has been onsite with the city‚Äôs Information Technology team as of Saturday, Feb. 27.

‚ÄúThe city is continuing to work to discover the extent of the event,‚Äù the release continued. ‚ÄúThe criminal investigation is ongoing and we will update the public as we work with the Arizona National Guard Cyber Joint Task Force.‚Äù

Haines said the future of the Tuesday, March 2 Kingman City Council meeting is uncertain as of now.

"Lazy YU does have CCR''s and an HOA that primarily maintains the roads that the County does not maintain. I believe that there are two different HOAs for two different sections of it. One is here: [http://www.lazyyu2.org/](http://www.lazyyu2.org/) 

For Cedar Hills Ranch, if you mean the area east of the Hualapais near Hwy 93 south of I-40, it is OK. I know there is a big land sales project out there that sells cheap land that was subdivided down from ranch land. A lot of it is on very primitive roads with no maintenance that are not worth much and are usually bought by people from outside the area excited by the low price per acre. It is very similar to land in Yucca - lots of acreage for cheap, but the land is basically a hunk of desert in the middle of nowhere with poor roads and no services.

Kingman has its good an bad just like anywhere else. Been here since i was a kid moved here in 97 when there was almost nothing. It has bars some decent places to eat to many fast food in my opinion. The biggest downside comes to the area you move to there are two area that the drugs are kinda bad in and break ins are higher birdland and butler area (we are a constitutional county so if you have guns you have nothing to worry about). Its dusty here and hot we have 2 time out of the year for storms in late winter not that cold and mid summer into early fall. Dont get much snow usually been a little odd that last few years more snow than ive seen since ive moved here. Plenty of places to ride motorcycles both on and off road. Lake havasu is 45 min away Laughlin is 45 min away Vegas hour to hour and a half depending on your driving. Not to much of a night scene. There is a lot of history in the area and if you want to see the grandcanyon its not to far niether is oatman. Just keep in mind the summer out here is unforgiving use sunscreen drink plenty of water and electrolytes. Keep an eye out for rattlesnakes the western Diamondback and Mojave green. Other than they drug areas here i love it and wouldnt trade it for anywhere.

"Been here 26 yrs. Lived previously in Wyoming and Maine. The absolute best feature of this area is the weather, followed closely by the lack of bugs. The temperature here is gorgeous, with a few weeks a year of either marginally chilly (30 or below) or super hot (above 110). There are almost no mosquitos (unless you're down to the river marshes), no black flies, no gnats. 

The next best thing is its proximity to other things. The grand canyon is an hour. Vegas is a little more. Laughlin is 45 minutes. You can hit SoCal for the weekend. You can hit  Flagstaff and the peaks in a few hours. Mexico is a day trip. 

The people here are not great. Rednecks that are thoroughly ignorant, and very proud of their ignorance.  It is one of the least educated counties in the entire country. There is a lot of drug activity. 

The food scene is sad. Chain restaurants mostly, with one or two mom & pop shops that are worth a damn. We are technically in ""food desert"", which means we get the short end of the stick for fresh produce or meat and the grocery store selection can be spotty. There is a small locavore group and a minuscule farmer's market on weekends, but it's very expensive. 

There also aren't many jobs, but it sounds like you have that covered. Both my kids work at KRMC. It's okay, although it has a lot of turnover and can be a little toxic (but that's rural Healthcare anywhere, basically). 

The city government is rooted in 1954 and refuses to move forward. If they could, they would put back up the Sundown Town signs and bury their heads in the dirt. We used to have a functional airport, until these yahoos decided they weren't going to let ""Obama"" tell them how to run it (actually it was DHS, and nothing to do with Obama).

"I moved here in September of 2018 from Houston.

Kingman is a small rural town and has mostly people with the typical mentality for that kind of place. However, there are some pretty good folks here too and a lot of beautiful scenery.

Things I like: my five minute commute, my cheap rent, the Hualapai Mountains, easy day trips to Vegas, the Thai restaurant near downtown, the local breweries, the absolute quietness of my neighborhood after dark and a quick drive to the river if I want to see some water.

Things I don‚Äôt like: there are a lot of rednecks and not enough good restaurants unless you like fast food.

I would force myself off of them, dealing w the issues of the chemo and the pains of withdrawal myself.

"Kingman depends on your lifestyle and worldview.  Jobs are mostly restaurant slash retail.  There are industrial jobs and KRMC is usually hiring.  Not just for providers, but support staff.  

Culturally, Kingman is very red and I have found no evidence of racism.  There is a mosque here.  People like their guns and open carry is common.

Whether I would rent a home out would depend on where the house is located.  Most of Northern Kingman (north of Northern Ave and between Stockton Hill and Andy Devine/66 is Butler/bird land (streets have bird names) and with a few exceptions should be avoided.  If you choose to rent, and you want decent renters,  allow pets with steep deposit, and a minimum credit score of 650 or higher.   I have an amazing credit score but can't find a place that allows pets.  

Recent (last year or so) arrivals are Californians wanting to stay close to CA but in a red county.  There is a community College with NAU extension, Vegas is 2 hours away, Phoenix is 3 to 4, and Flagstaff/Snowbowl is 2.  Bullhead / Laughlin is a thing, and runs 10 to 20 degrees warmer than Kingman pretty consistently.

I grew up here, left for 25 years and came back to care for my dad, now my mom has immigrated from CA.  I'll stay til she passes, then look for some place with trees (like Eastern TN).  My husband and I work for the hospital, my spectrum son works fast food.

Overall, it's a pretty average little town, and if you lean red and stay out of Butler, you can be happy here.  CoVid has put quite a damper on things here (softball, soccer, Deaf events, Golf Tournaments, SCA, etc) but you can involve yourself as deeply in to the community as you choose.  Lots of volunteer opportunities.  Most stay to themselves.  

However if you think flying a confederate flag makes one a racist, you may not like it here.

The driving factor for the growth here is the ultra low taxes.  We attract the scum that doesn't want to pay anything for any county/city/state funded service.

"It's well documented that [the more educated someone is, the more left-leaning they tend to be](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2016/04/26/a-wider-ideological-gap-between-more-and-less-educated-adults/).  Are there conservatives with graduate degrees?  Yes, but there are significantly more liberal/progressives at that level of education.  I cannot comment on whether this is because one group puts a greater emphasis on education or whether folks' political views change with more education.  It's probably a combination of factors and not any one thing.  That said, it is not a coincidence that red states/counties tend to also be less educated.

Mohave County, as a whole, struggles in the area of [educational attainment](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=0500000US04015).  I'm not calling anyone a hick or indicating that education = intelligence, but there is no denying that less than 13% of the people who live here have a Bachelor's degree or higher.  Having or not having a degree does not make someone a good or bad person, but the lack of quality education can significantly limit one's perspective and potential.  Arizona ranks [very poorly in public education](https://ktar.com/story/2672670/arizona-ranked-3rd-worst-public-education-system-in-nation/) which is another part of this issue.

"I'm gonna make a lot of friends when I post this answer. /s

Short answer is no.  You're gonna have to go to Vegas to be around any kind of like minded people.

Long answer.... most people in the tri-state (area of kingman, bullhead and havasu) don't have enough education to understand or be compassionate about issues like BLM.  Education is a low priority in the desert compared to other areas of the country.

A small group of traveling BLM activist (approx 20 ppl) came through Kingman and Laughlin in June and people where ""defending"" their businesses in Kingman with AR-15's against 20 ppl.  I saw pictures of people literally standing outside their business on Beale with a fucking assault rifle to defend against a small group of peaceful protesters.

Kingman just had a ""Stop the Steal"" rally and Trump Train car parade this last Sunday if that tells you anything.

There is younger, liberal people around but we are definitely outnumbered tenfold or twentyfold by uneducated hicks.  Unless you have a great job opportunity I'd maybe consider elsewhere unless.

Just my two cents.  I live in Laughlin about 30 miles from Kingman.  I moved here a year and a half ago and will be leaving once this pandemic gets under control.

"Been here 26 yrs, and the last four have been the most active for progressives in this area. 

u/wiseblueberry laid it out pretty well. The BLM related event here was organized by a couple of local young women (my kids are friends with them). There isn't really a strong progressive presence here, but they are starting to organize. Apart from the local Democrats, there us also a community group called Kingman Progressive Alliance that used to meet monthly, but is mostly online now due to covid. We held open forums with community leaders for discussions about how we can engage with them to support strategies and policies that aren't grounded in backwards-ass 1940s social ideals. 

Don't start out with any delusions, though. This town is deep red Trumpistan, and the cult is strong. The KPA and Dem population is quite small, and has a vitriolic hatred from the community at large. The BLM event was peaceful, except for the armed anti-BLM protesters who showed up to cause problems. There are currently a bunch of ""Trump train"" caravans of trucks flying Trump flags and driving around town honking and beung generally obnoxious. We have two separate recall petitions for the mayor and a councilwoman because they dared to implement CDC recommended precautions for the pandemic. 

In 2018 I attended a rally for Prop 203 for education funding, and we were also met with armed assholes threatening us. 

The KPA and other groups are trying. There's just a
 monumental amount of hatred and ignorance to overcome. They actively engage with other local groups like the city council, the local farmers market, and small business in the community.

"Been here 26 yrs. I'll admit that this piece isn't representative of the entire county. However, it isn't that far off either. This community is quite bigoted. I routinely witness this kind of casual, overt racism, sexism, homophobia, islamophobia, you name it.  Probably because I'm a white guy they think it's okay to express it around me. 

I overhear it at the grocery store. I hear it in the waiting room at the dentist. It's all over, and it's constant. But of course if you ask these people, none of them will think they qualify as a bigot. They are under the impression that unless you wear bedsheets and burn crosses you aren't REALLY a racist. And everyone they know thinks and talks the same way, so it's socially reinforced, and they surely can't ALL be racists, right? 

But they can, and are. 

I actually got reprimanded at work once because I told someone who was being super racist that he needed to not bring that shit into the workplace. Like the snowflake little bitch that conservative men always are, he complained to HR that I was restricting his ""free speech"". Rather than upset this guy and his entire cadre of fucktards that are all bigoted assholes, HR thought it was better to mollify the majority by reprimanding me for making it a ""hostile environment"".

"A miner and his family moved into a small wooden shack along a dry wash in the middle of the canyon. The wife‚Äôs name was Luana, thus the name of the canyon.

The husband wanted nothing more than to provide a better life for his wife and children. It wasn‚Äôt uncommon in those days for a man to leave his family for weeks at a time and seek gold in the Northwestern Mountains. This miner was no different and so he would venture off into the mountains in search of gold and food for his family. The only food his family had was what he brought home from his gold hunting expeditions.

One day the miner rode off on the back of a mule and never returned. No one knows what became of him. But, it is thought he was probably the victim of a robbery, an accident or perhaps killed by wild animals.

Luana patiently waited for her husband‚Äôs return‚Ä¶but he didn‚Äôt. The food eventually ran out and they found themselves starving. Without food and unable to care for her children, Luana slowly became insane. Her children became weak and constantly begged for food, but there was none to be had.

Unable to cope with watching her children slowly starve to death, she murdered them and cut them up into small pieces. It is also said she put on her white wedding gown before committing the ghastly act. When she had finished, her white wedding gown and the walls of the tiny wooden shack were splattered with the blood of her children. Locals in Kingman called the house where the murders took place the ‚ÄúSlaughterhouse.‚Äù

The woman then carried the remains of her children down to the edge of the river and tossed them in. She collapsed in a blood soaked heap and began to wail loudly for her children. She remained on the river bank continuing to scream and wail until the next morning when she succumbed to starvation herself. She died mourning the children she had murdered.

According to local residents the wails and sobs of a heartbroken and psychotic mother can still be heard within the canyon. Those who have heard it are convinced it is simply not just an urban legend.",t2_6909i4ab,mohaveaz,0,1603853100.0,0,t1_gacd5wx,gacd5wx,True,allimaginary,t3_jiwg5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingman/comments/jiwg5p/slaughterhouse_canyon/,Slaughterhouse Canyon,/r/Kingman/comments/jiwg5p/slaughterhouse_canyon/gacd5wx/,5,r/Kingman,0,5

"Yeah, they've been abandoned for decades, I'm sure. When I was out there around 2010, most of the structures were riddled with bullet holes, had trash/belongings strewn about, and had been severely weathered. I'm not sure exactly when people would have still been living there, but I'm going to guess the story my stepfather and his friend told me was when they went there sometime during the 1980s.  

If you look on Google Earth, you can view satellite imagery from all the way back to 1997. The photos are obviously not as good as the more current ones, but you can definitely see the structures there and they looked like people may have been living there up to around 2003 or so. This is total speculation on my part, though. Its interesting to see how the condition of the structures changes over the years with newer and newer satellite pictures.",t2_9q2hs,Starbomber73,0,1602797975.0,0,t1_g8xvptv,g8xvptv,False,Starbomber73,t3_jabcey,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingman/comments/jabcey/anyone_know_anything_about_an_old_and_abandoned/,Anyone know anything about an old and abandoned commune in the Wabayuma mountains South East of Kingman?,/r/Kingman/comments/jabcey/anyone_know_anything_about_an_old_and_abandoned/g8xvptv/,1,r/Kingman,0,1

KINGMAN, Ariz. ‚Äî Danielle Stephens ran her fingers down a long list of her relatives' names and sighed.

All of them had been diagnosed with cancer. Most of them had died, many before they were 55.

Like Stephens, 81, they had all spent their lives in Kingman, Arizona, where during the Cold War they often watched the early morning sky lit up by orange flashes from atomic bombs detonated at a government testing site in the Nevada desert less than 150 miles north of the city.

""Back then, no one thought the tests were dangerous,"" said Stephens, who ran a cattle ranch with her husband.

The list of her family members with cancer grew to 32 in July, when she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. It is the radiation exposure from those nuclear tests that Stephens believes caused her cancer and that of her family members and scores of others who lived in lower Mohave County in the 1950s and '60s. Her relatives had breast, colon, thyroid and kidney cancer, all of which have been linked to radioactive fallout.

""I just think it's a travesty, and the government should not be allowed to get away with it,"" Stephens said.",t2_6909i4ab,mohaveaz,0,1600017391.0,0,t1_g54tavd,g54tavd,True,mohaveaz,t3_is2891,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingman/comments/is2891/arizonas_downwinders_exposed_to_cold_war_nuclear/,"Arizona's 'downwinders,' exposed to Cold War nuclear testing, fight for compensation",/r/Kingman/comments/is2891/arizonas_downwinders_exposed_to_cold_war_nuclear/g54tavd/,2,r/Kingman,0,2

"Mohave County reports more COVID-19 patients on ventilators

KINGMAN ‚Äì There‚Äôs an increase in the number of ventilators in use to treat COVID-19 patients in Mohave County, county Health Director Denise Burley told the county board of supervisors Thursday, July 9.

‚ÄúThis is concerning, of course, because this talks about extreme cases,‚Äù Burley said. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt use a ventilator unless it‚Äôs the last resort. They are very hard on people.‚Äù

Burley said county hospitals still have some capacity when it comes to ventilators, and that the state has already ordered additional ventilators that will be allocated to hospitals as needed.

County health officials are expecting an increase of cases as a consequence of Fourth of July holiday celebrations. ‚ÄúIn the next 10 days we will start to see some of those cases playing themselves out,‚Äù Burley said.

Burley also spoke about a larger number of cases requiring hospitalization recently in both the Kingman and Lake Havasu City service areas.

The mortality rate ‚Äì the number of deaths divided by the number of confirmed cases ‚Äì in Mohave County is 5.7%, more than three times the state average of 1.8%.

‚ÄúThis number is a little higher than we‚Äôd like to see,‚Äù Burley said, referring to the 91 COVID-19 deaths in the county as ‚Äúpreventable.‚Äù

District 3 Supervisor Buster Johnson brought up the possibility of declaring a ‚Äúmask program‚Äù in the unincorporated areas of the county and asked Burley for her opinion.

‚ÄúWe strongly recommend taking all mitigation efforts seriously,‚Äù Burley said. ‚ÄúI certainly recommend that the county adopt this policy and that is Public Health‚Äôs perspective and certainly my recommendation moving forward.‚Äù

Burley made the same suggestion last week, but the board took no action.

The goal is to keep county hospitals below capacity, she added, and masks are a preventive tool to assist with that.

District 5 Supervisor Ron Gould said that his assistant was in Walmart in Fort Mohave and that people are complying with wearing masks without the mandate. Unless the county is ready to mandate people to wear face masks in their homes and enforce that, Gould said he is against any additional mandates.

He also asked Burley if the most recent shipment of 3,000 COVID-19 tests the county received could be reserved for individuals with symptoms only.

Burley said people with symptoms are the focus of the testing effort anyway, but said it would be difficult to monitor.",t2_6909i4ab,mohaveaz,0,1594484379.0,0,t1_fxp2vp1,fxp2vp1,True,mohaveaz,t3_hp4gk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kingman/comments/hp4gk4/heartbreaking/,Heartbreaking,/r/Kingman/comments/hp4gk4/heartbreaking/fxp2vp1/,1,r/Kingman,0,1
