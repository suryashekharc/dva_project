"I have bad news dude...

This is not a good place to date for numerous reasons. The main reason is that men far outnumber women in Durango. A lot of guys move here for the outdoor opportunities and male-dominated professions that no women want to do (guiding, firefighting, forest service, construction etc).

Since I've been here I've dated college girls, and since men don't go to college anymore, the school is mostly women. College age men seem to be completely absent. I don't even know what they're doing (videogaymes?) but I never encounter them. The college girls are fun but they're in zoomer party mode and I get tired of that.

Everyone here will say the same nonsensical things such as ""join a group that \[hikes/ ski/ raft/ whatever\]"" but the truth is that it's pretty tough to meet anyone due to the size of the town. It's only about 10k people, so you get to know the options pretty quick, and any quality chick is either hitched or has like ten dudes texting her.

I love it here but I'm probably moving soon due to the limited social and dating scene.

The positive I could say about women here is that ya they tend to me more outdoorsy and more hippy-mountain girl, but again, the negatives seem to far outweigh that.

EDIT: Wanted to add that these people claiming there are hot women everywhere here have no clue what they're talking about LOL. I've lived in major metros and other rural areas and - just no. These people either have low standards or something and even many of the college chicks think they're bad but they're average at best on a campus like ASU or Boulder.

I'll be totally honest I'm okay with it being difficult to get in and out of Durango even if it can be an inconvenience at times.

 With that being said, when I first moved here in 2014 it was like $300 more to fly out of Durango to go just about anywhere except Vegas or Denver. We used to just drive to ABQ to save a little cash. Now, it's a marginal difference. So, at least there's that.

"Frankly I'm wondering when we'll begin to see serious consequences to public services. Durango is a nice place, but it's not ""hour long commute just to work here"" good. When will schools, emergency services, etc. begin to struggle to attract labor? We saw restaurants close or operate at irregular hours last year; when will schools be forced to begin doing the same? It already takes months to schedule an appointment at Mercy.

Meanwhile no one has a real solution. The City thinks people will work in Durango just for the opportunity to rent a remodeled hotel room, and FLC would rather have faculty and staff living on-campus than increase pay.

My personal thought is that the choice with the bike lanes is the best compromise: wider sidewalks for people, businesses, and restaurants; bike lanes to encourage people not to drive; some car lanes to allow people to see downtown quickly and access it fairly easily. Fewer car lanes would encourage most people to take another road if they are commuting.

"A few thoughts:

1. We can‚Äôt ‚Äòbuild‚Äô our way out of this crisis. There‚Äôs simply not enough land and costs to build are excessive. 

2. In-fill of existing properties is needed. The old 9R admin building, for example, would have been great for workforce housing. The city simply wasn‚Äôt poised to purchase it. There are other mechanisms that can be leveraged such as the URA.

3. There needs to be more public / private / developer partnerships to shoulder the full burden. This is starting to happen.

We are very outdoor recreation driven. I suppose you could spend a day at Lake Nighthorse, they've got a big bouncy deal set up. My 2yr old was on it last Summer and did....alright. There's a lot of vigourous, youthful traffic on it. Otherwise there's a decent beach area there for everyone to play on. Rent some paddle boards!

"I'd recommend a few things:

1. When you do homework or study, do it in study rooms and get to know the people there. Once you start to take classes that you actually like, then it's literally how you find people who like the same things as you.
2. Join some clubs. There are a number of decent ones up there and they're all pretty fun.
3. Take some outdoor-oriented PE classes. I recommend hiking and badminton (seriously, badminton is fucking great). Outdoor stuff is really what we have to do around here, and it's the core reason that many people move here in the first place, so finding people who enjoy doing the most enjoyable activity here is nice.
4. Get a job tutoring (e.g. at STEM3) if you have a solid lock on a few subjects.

It's really all just about getting involved. There are no real places to just ""meet"" people, but as a college student? There are loads of opportunities. Study rooms and a tutoring job are how I made most of my friends though; asking and answering questions is a great and natural way to start conversations, and going off on tangents is a quick way to find out what people like.

"For clarity, this op-ed seems to be using ""Ranked Choice Voting"" to mean ""Instant Runoff Voting"", which is one of many voting schemes that use a ranked ballot.

In my opinion, IRV is one of the worst of the many options that improve significantly on First Past the Post (the traditional voting system in the US, where the single candidate with the most first-place votes wins).

Are there reasons the op-ed doesn't also discuss things like Approval Voting or STAR voting? These seem to me like far superior systems, with comparable or reduced complexity compared to IRV, and fewer weird results and drawbacks.

(I'm in favor of changes here, and would vote to approve a change to IRV over FPtP, but think that AV, STAR voting, or possibly one of the Condorcet methods would be better yet.)",t2_8pld0,EvanDaniel,0,1644001376.0,0,t1_hvljfvq,hvljfvq,True,orange_wires,t3_skkp4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Durango/comments/skkp4y/our_view_ranked_choice_voting/,Our View: Ranked choice voting,/r/Durango/comments/skkp4y/our_view_ranked_choice_voting/hvljfvq/,8,r/Durango,0,8

"Thank you so much for taking the time to comment, that's very kind of you. I'm not sure what the issue was, as I've got some responses on the survey so far. FYI, this will wax verbose, my apologies.

Another person had suggested in the survey that we incorporate additional crafts, which we had considered.  However, there are already two locations in town that have a similar business model (though I don't think they advertise well enough.  One I only learned of while researching this idea, and the other only because I happened to walk by on-foot.)  I'm wary of making this too overly-complicated, as we've never started a business before ('scuse me, I'm nauseated, lol) and we want to balance being streamlined but not bare-bones. 

We plan to encourage repeat business with loyalty cards, ""county days\*,"" and by having the BEST customer service- I've worked retail for 16 years (9 years managing a store downtown) and amazing customer service\*\*. Businesses have ONE chance at a first impression, so by adopting a customer-centric mindset and making the process painless, we hope to overcome the seasonal slump.

Again, I very much appreciate you taking the time to respond. ALL feedback is helpful at this point, since I am in control of my destiny,\*\* and I want it to be a good one.  

Take care, -A.

"Wow. Thank you for taking the time to share this.  I was SO close to falling for it just now. Met a girl on Adult Friend Finder site.  Or so I thought.  She was sexy AF so I kept talking to her.  She informed me that she was a massage therapist and everything seemed fine until she informed me that in order to book a ""special"" massage, you have to give up your credit card info and deposit $3.  Since the deposit amount was insignificant, it didn't sound very shady to me at first.  Then I thought about it and realized that is a big ass red flag.  So I searched Reddit and thank God I did. I would have been fucking pissed if that robot or fat dude sitting in his Mom's basement managed to outwit me.  Sometimes it's next to impossible to think logically when all your mind can think about is hooking up with some hot chick, but the scammers know this already obviously.  They are very clever.

"Lol I can understand skepticism on the topic. And I would also suspect women are easier to hypnotize as they generally seem to be more in touch with their intuition. I've sensed a heightened sense of my own intuition before and during menstrual cycles. And from my training, men tend to more often be more ""left-brained"", so they can be somewhat resistant more often, from what I've heard. But you cant surprise hypnotize anyone though. They have to want to be and permit it to happen.

"Hey OP, I‚Äôm a shuttle dispatcher for Purgatory. Unfortunately, the resort doesn‚Äôt offer a shuttle service past 9pm. That being said, there‚Äôs a few other options available that might be able to help you out:

Animas Transportation:
970-259-1315
Durango Transportation:
970-259-4818
Buckhorn Limousine (They have shuttles too):
970-769-0933

Despite these options, I‚Äôd really recommend that you just rent a car. The restaurants at the resort are insanely understaffed, and they‚Äôre operating with limited hours because of it. Especially considering how much there is to eat/do in Durango, it‚Äôs worth investing in a rental car so you can head into town at your own discretion.

But if politicals and voters drive the price up and the time to develop up they'll be building more expensive places instead of cheap places because that's the only way to recover the investment.

"We're down \~80% in Durango inventory from 2 years ago.  The genie is out of the bottle: people learned Durango is cool *and more affordable than most other Colorado mountain resort towns,* and wanted to get out of the city once they could work from home.  Interest rates hit alltime lows which motivated some folks make a move. While the inventory dwindled, those that would normally make the lateral move (sell then buy something else in town) stopped selling, because there was nothing for them to buy. There's far more demand to live in Durango than there used to be. 

New construction slowed and shifted. Lumber got stupid expensive, materials and labor have been in short supply.  And with all the demand, builders stopped building spec homes to sell, they're all working on private builds. Twin Buttes had a handful of new listings hit the market this year- all the construction you see in there are homes that are already paid for and aren't hitting the market. 

As of last month, Durango had 1 month of inventory supply.  The entire MLS for SW corner of Colorado had 2.

But, we wanted to stay in Durango because it's where she went to school and where I felt at peace for the first time in life.

"My point was that those benefits *barely even exist anymore*. When *I* was working through college the most anyone I knew working in food service got was 25% off one meal at end of shift. Likewise, ""scheduling flexibility"" no longer means the employer will be flexible; it means the employer expects the employee to work whenever the employer demands, classes and studying be damned. 

Your original point was that workers being priced out is not important because student workers can be exploited to do the jobs while their housing costs are still belayed or externalized. You minimized the impact of cost of living on labor supply by saying employers can turn to a more exploitative labor model instead of improving compensation. How is that not treating student workers like scabs? 

The idea that ""we all make and learn from our decisions"" is going to come back around when Durango is reduced to just another shopping mall resort town. Destitute teachers and emergency services, empty vacation homes, employers recommending workers commute 45+ minutes and all the en vogue chain stores. We already have three of the four horsemen.",t2_7vf23pad,AdministrativeZone25,0,1640201744.0,0,t1_hpldo6b,hpldo6b,False,iseemountains,t3_rlseez,https://www.reddit.com/r/Durango/comments/rlseez/2021_real_estate_recap_2022_crystal_ball_best/,2021 real estate recap + 2022 crystal ball best guesses!,/r/Durango/comments/rlseez/2021_real_estate_recap_2022_crystal_ball_best/hpldo6b/,2,r/Durango,0,2
"I graduated in the spring of 09.  It was an awesome time to have student loans and look for a job... When I was in college, a free quality meal was a great perk, along with a subsidized bar tab.  What's out of touch taking free meals and flexibility into consideration? You're still putting words in my mouth, I never suggested treating student workers like scabs. That demographic and the hospitality/service industry simply compliment each other. You're in class throughout the week, you can't commit to a 9-5 schedule (nor would you potentially qualify or have the experience for the position). But having the flexibility to work various shifts throughout the week allows you to work around class and studying. Help me understand what's changed? 

I don't even know if college is the best path forward anymore, It's so dependent.  I was working with the Trades 'n Training program, which teaches high school kids the tools of the trades (remember seeing some tiny homes built and sold by DHS and BHS?) These kids are graduating highschool knowing how to frame, run electrical, plumbing, finish work, the permitting process- and they're getting scooped up by local contractors for $20+/hr, right out of high school.  We all make and learn from our decisions. I worked at Purg about  8 years ago for something like 8.50/hr + tips in their transportation department. It was a joke. My wife and I lived off of mac and cheese that winter... But I applied what I learned from that and my time doing jeep tours with one of the local outfitters here and started my own tours and transportation company. Once my wife got pregnant, I took what I learned from growing and running that business (couldn't really drive midnight shuttles to telluride in snowstorms on new born sleep ya know), and applied it to my real estate career.

I hope Durango wages catch up. But it doesn't seem like they're willing to? Employers want to blame the lack of people wanting to work, but they're still don't seem to want to offer a livable wage in today's market. (The mcdonalds $15 vs $19hr) Did you see the Herald article about the city snowplow driver shortage? Maybe offer folks with CDLs more than $20/hr?  Stoneage got hit by that hack right before covid. I heard they cut pay for the year, and then let people go the following year. Mercy starts their new \[local\] RNs around $30/hr, but pays travel nurses $100+/hr.  You talk about white collar jobs: anyone who didn't get a 6.8% raise this year, they took a pay cut due to inflation. It's no secret the wage and wealth gap has widened over the decades across the country. You ask what will happen to jobs? We're already seeing what will happen: there's already chinks in the armor here, just like CB, Telluride, Ouray, etc. Restaurants randomly closing throughout the week due to staffing. At one point Carver was hiring for a dishwasher at $19/hr! Like I said, I don't have the silver bullet, I'm not the smartest guy in the room, I don't have the answers.

"Yeahhhh...we shouldn't ever expect students to fill jobs here in town. Sure, they might, but those students have bills too.

"When did you graduate college? Frankly, that you wrote these jobs offer meals and flexibility makes me think you are out of touch. I worked throughout college before graduating six years ago and student economics have already changed dramatically. I think you also overestimate the sustainability of the student supply given that the college is already renting out hotels just to have inventory for which students can pay room and board.

What advantages do you think students have over regular workers? Why do you think using student workers like scabs is a good thing? What do you think will happen to essential jobs that students cannot do when these economic factors continue to drive out the workers able to do them?

"You're welcome! I'm a visual person, so I know how it feels *seeing* these numbers put in perspective. 

The premise has been is when rates go down, prices go up. (Buying power increases, prices go up to capture the extra money on the table). So if rates go up, prices should go down? Maybe in other markets, but I think Durango is on it's own trajectory. I just don't see price appreciation significantly slowing as long as there's limited inventory and the local and regional recreational opportunities continue to draw people here.

Cash buyers aren't affected by interest rates or beholden to appraisals (which really aren't an issue here) and underwriting. A recent National Association of Homebuilders article sums up the answer to your questions : *This implied tightening is consistent with our existing forecast of a 2% 10-year Treasury rate near the end of 2022. This higher rate also implies the 30-year mortgage rate rising to somewhat higher than 3.6% by the end of next year. Nonetheless, today‚Äôs policy pivot, in response to increased inflation data and inflation expectations, will yield higher interest rates in 2022 due to tighter monetary policy. This change will reduce housing affordability and again emphasizes the need for policymakers to enact solutions to fix the nation‚Äôs supply-chains.*

"Oh yeah, looking back on that comment I can see how it comes off that way. You generalized my statement though, but I still think there's some truth to the idea-  I could have explained it better.

Have things changed? When I was in college, a hospitality/service gig was kind of the thing to do; best bang for the buck along with meals and a flexible schedule. I didn't say FLC students will do *all* the jobs, I specified service/hospitality/tourism. You're in college, you're not supposed to be working a full time 9-5; but getting work experience, earning referrals and building your resume has value.

"Hey folks, happy holidays and new years and all that jazz! It's been a hell of a couple years, I hope everyone has been hanging in there. People say a lot of things about Durango, but the one thing I've always admired is the resilient community.  The good news is that the weather and snow is looking pretty favorable for the next couple of weeks! I daydream about all the rafting I'll be able do while shoveling my driveway...

I know the real estate and housing market is a hot subject these days, and it seems like the saga will continue at least for the near future. Simply put, it's supply and demand: inventory continues to shrink, sales are kind of almost maintaining, and median sales price continues to climb. There is still high desire to buy, but the sales are tapering because there's just not as much on the market. 

* \*December numbers are month to date. I don't see them changing too much, but they'll adjust a little for true annual numbers. 
* Our current inventory is down about 84% from this time two years ago, and about 59% from last December.  It's not just Durango and La Plata County, my entire MLS (from Delta to Pueblo, pretty much the entire SW corner of Colorado) is down about 70% in inventory from 2 years ago. 
* The median sales price in Durango is up about 20% YTD. I think as long as there is minimal inventory, the demand will continue to drive prices up. Inflation certainly played a factor, but Durango has an exclusive draw to it. Sometimes folks that have been here for a while forget how badass this area is. Durango is still one of the most affordable Colorado resort towns.
* I know its odd to compare current statistics to those from two years ago. I reference 2019 because it's our last ""normal"" year, and it paints such a contrasting picture. After seeing that 2020 wasn't a fluke year, I'm calling 2019 the old market. We've been in a new market since. 

I'm happy to chat about this stuff- feel free to hit me up! I know housing is getting expensive, and for some locals, it feels unobtainable. I don't have the golden answer or a silver bullet, I'm sorry.

"Purg has been a bit of a shitshow recently. I think this past summer the lift was broken so often that they ended up needing to refund passholders. I don't bother with it anymore. As other posters have mentioned, there's tons of other good trail systems in town (gulch, twin buttes, high point, etc) and up in the high country. IMO high country riding is what's truly special around here if you are OK w altitude. 

Good luck and enjoy!

"Welcome!!

If you haven't done XC ski before, the Nordic Center does a weekly adults lesson that is a great intro to skate ski (spoiler alert, it's fucking hard!) [https://www.durangonordic.org/masters-programs](https://www.durangonordic.org/masters-programs)

The other nearby XC places are Vallecito (skate/classic), La Plata Canyon (classic), and sometimes the golf course in town (skate/classic). La Plata also seems to be the default place to walk your dog in the winter--get a friendly dog and you'll meet a new friend every day :)

Once MTB season rolls around, Devo does lessons as well, which is a great way to meet people. [https://durangodevo.com/](https://durangodevo.com/)

If you are not used to any mountain driving in good or bad weather you can always go via Moab. It adds 2 hours over the wolf creek route and 1 hour over the Red Mountain Route but it has great views and less mountain passes.

"Long time Durango gamer here. I have had Spectrum (Charter, Bresnan) since around 2003/2004. Ping has never been great but ok, I guess. Until this Oct! First week of Oct 2021 all pings times were cut in half! Finally \~35 ping! Usually best to Texas or Chicago servers. I thought it was too good to be true! And it was. One week later all pings times, at the same time, all over Durango, over night, quadrupled!  ... Ping times went from 70ms to 35ms to 125ms to Texas (for Valorant) in the span of 8 days. WTF! As a player of fast twitch tactical FPS games like CS:GO and Valorant this is unacceptable! It makes all the difference. Our fastest times are now to Oregon servers? How does that make any sense? Same as other posters I have called and complained. Customer Support says it's high but still within acceptable ranges... F that. The techs that come to my house understand but after testing the lines, swapping modems etc. they say there is nothing they can do and it's up to ""higher up techs"" in Spectrum which are impossible for them and consumers to communicate with. I still get plenty of Download and Upload bandwidth, streaming videos isn't an issue so I guess they don't care since most costumers just watch TV and check their emails. 

**PLEASE EVERYONE CALL AND COMPLAIN NOW.** Even if you have called before call now. We need more people to complain at the same time for anyone to look into this. It's obviously possible for our ping to be lower as it was Oct 1st-7th this year. 

\*FYI I have worked in tech for over 10 years. I have been a computer and tech enthusiast for 20+ years. I know what I am talking about.

"Spectrum in Durango had reasonable ping a few years ago but it doubled overnight one night. As another commenter mentioned, there have been a couple of days here and there where it‚Äôs returned to normal, but if latency is at all important to you, Spectrum is one of the worst providers I‚Äôve ever had to deal with. I‚Äôve called a ton over the years and they‚Äôve sent a few techs out, but they always say it‚Äôs my router (even when I get the same results connecting straight to the modem) or that it‚Äôs due to connections further up than what they‚Äôre responsible for. They‚Äôve never taken a modicum of responsibility for the abysmal internet infrastructure we‚Äôve got here.
