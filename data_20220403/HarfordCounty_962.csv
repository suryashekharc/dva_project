"Throwaway because I have to see these guys in person sometimes. Also not a registered Republican so I can't vote in the primary anyway.

I'm tired of Glassman and Boniface just represents Glassman 2.0 to me. He has done little for anyone outside of his favored areas of the county and I'm thoroughly unimpressed.

I haven't had much personal interaction with Cassilly because he's been at the state level for the last few terms. That said, when asked to help, he seems to show up. I'm sure there are better candidates who live in the county, but given the choice between the two, it's not hard for me to pick.

"OK, cool. That helps a bit.

If you don't mind minor league baseball, there is the [Aberdeen Ironbirds](https://www.milb.com/aberdeen). They're just celebrating their 20 year anniversary, so there's a lot of stuff planned for that. They're the Single-A affiliate for the Orioles, so you see a lot of their new talent pass through.

There's a lot of different drinking options. We have a lot of microbreweries in the area, two of my favorites are [Double Groove](https://doublegroovebrewing.com/) and [Alecraft](https://alecraft.beer/) (both are dog friendly, if that makes a difference); [Battery Island](https://batteryislandbrewing.com/) in Havre de Grace is really good, too. Alecraft and Battery Island have trivia evenings through Charm City Trivia. Double Groove has a music trivia night once a month, too. 

If you like harder stuff, a short drive down to Baltimore has[Old Line Spirits](https://www.oldlinespirits.com/), which makes some really good whiskey and rum. They have a tasting club which is really good, and a little bar that's open on Saturdays.

If you want to work out, my gym of choice is the Fitness Center of Havre de Grace. Kim makes it a great environment and is an excellent coach. There's a wide variety of classes, as well as 24-hour access for members. It's also dog friendly.

There's a lot of great parks in the county. One of my favorites is Susquehanna State Park. It has a lot of great trails and some good swimming holes. If you like disc golf, there's a lot of different courses. I personally really like the Millbrook course in Churchville.

"That’s a pretty good budget. You can find a decent single family in bel air or Forest hill for that price which are two of the nicer parts of harco. 

Here’s one I found from a quick search that looks nice. In Harford county typically you want to stay northwest of i95. There are some ok houses on the other side but it’s a rough area. It probably matters more if you have kids going to public school. Once you get north of forest hill, it has more of a rural country small town feel, if you are into that kind of thing. Forest hill, bel air and Fallston are very suburban, standard neighborhoods with families. I’d stay away from Edgewood, aberdeeen and joppatowne and looking at your budget, you can afford to. 

If you have kids and care about schools, any of the ones in bel air, Fallston, and north Harford are fine. If you do pick a place districted for aberdeen, Edgewood, joppatowne or havre de grace, I’d recommend private school. 

Let me know if you have any other questions, I’ve lived here for over 25 years

With near- and medium-term supply of the available vaccines, the need for equity in access to vaccines across countries to achieve global public health goals, programmatic considerations including vaccine demand, and evolution of the virus, ***a vaccination strategy based on repeated booster doses of the original vaccine composition is unlikely to be appropriate or sustainable.***

My rejection may be irrelevant to those who reject the testing process or who do not value the information that I have seen.

Greenwald, Tiabbi, Substack, Gates, Fauci, Wolensky...

All are humans.  When you set a human up as an authority, and trust them, you are bound to be disappointed.  Greewald and Tiabbi are not covid experts in any sense of the word.  Trust data, statistics (when you know the difference between confidence interval and sampling range, I guess.) and peer reviewed articles -- obviously, with a mind to the fact that they are produced by humans and so also subject to error.  I realize it isn't as easy as having pablum fed to you by fear-mongering journalists intent on selling advertising, but it's really way better for your health.

> The article you didn't read shows the curve of an epidemic. With the current rate of spread of Omicron, which is extremely fast, the virus will burn itself out.

I don't need to read an article to understand the argument.  Let me ask you: is the only possibility that Omicron will be the last covid-19 variant?  Did you think the same about Delta?

> I have no idea what point you're trying to make here. I am not going through anything.

My point is illustrated in the brief story I related.  Let me bring it home for you.  If you believe that RFK, jr. is not anti-vax, you are like I was with the truffle salt: the only one.  What I asserted you are going through, and what parallel I'm drawing, is that you are deluded into thinking you are right about Berenson and RFK jr not being antivax.

> FYI...Hospitalization ALWAYS go up in winter, ask any nurse.

Not sure why think I'm going to dispute that generalization.  But more specifically, can you document any winters where the same sort of declarations of emergency at local hospitals were made?  Can you document the actual numbers of hospitalizations and the lack of beds and the average ER wait times?  Because that's what the article was trying to show you.

> I have no idea what point you're trying to make here. I am not going through anything. I've barely modified my behavior at all during the pandemic. My life hardly changed.

You're among the lucky.  As of October, 140,000 kids had lost one or more parents to the disease.  More than 800,000 U. S. citizens have now died from it.  If you haven't lost someone to the disease, or know someone who has lost someone to the disease, you are either extremely lucky, or extremely alone.  I'm glad your life has hardly changed.  It's changed drastically for the worse for millions.

> What's worrisome to me is that people like you are so easily swayed to accept a poorly tested vaccine with declining efficacy without so much as a question? 

Is that a question or a statement?  I reject the premise that it is poorly tested.  It's declining efficacy, is still better odds than not having the vaccine at all, and far safer than getting the disease unvaccinated.

> Are you planning on getting a 4th jab when it comes out?

Are you admitting that the pandemic won't end with Omicron ""burning itself"" out in a few weeks?

> Google the Milgram experiment. Fauci is the man in the white lab coat that people are listening to since he fulfills you're [sic] expectations of what an authority figure SHOULD look like not because of any exceptional knowledge he's displayed.

I don't need to google the Milgram experiment.  And again, I place little weight on arguments from authority, regardless of the source it is derived from.

> I'm curious about you though, how has Covid changed you? Frankly, you seemed to be somewhat fearful of entertaining any opposing ideas. 

I entertain and dismiss what is useless or foul.  What is sound and useful, I retain and make mine.  Fear has nothing to do with ideas.

>  Could you address what Wolensky said about 75% of the COVID deaths having 4 or more Comorbidities?

I did.  It isn't 75% of *all* covid deaths.  It's 75% of all *vaccinated* deaths.  According to her.  I haven't seen the statistics.  I haven't seen the entire clip, and I'm not going to waste my time with it.  I don't know if it is accurate or if there were other connotations in the conversation.  I hope you don't believe what she said constitutes evidence that 75% of everyone who died during the pandemic had comorbidities.  I hope you'd need something that looked like actual numbers and statistics before you decided that were true.  I hope you instead look and see that if you have less than 4 comorbidities and vaccinated, you are 24 times less likely to die from covid than someone who is unvaccinated.",t2_1ho5r3fi,Abitconfusde,0,1641860459.0,0,t1_hs4zft9,hs4zft9,False,6poolyourheart,t3_rsuvym,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/rsuvym/for_harford_a_year_of_turmoil_over_covid/,"For Harford, a year of turmoil over COVID restrictions ends with its hospitals declaring a state of disaster",/r/harfordcountymd/comments/rsuvym/for_harford_a_year_of_turmoil_over_covid/hs4zft9/,1,r/harfordcountymd,0,1

I have no idea what point you're trying to make here.  I am not going through anything.  I've barely modified my behavior at all during the pandemic.  My life hardly changed. What's worrisome to me is that people like you are so easily swayed to accept a poorly tested vaccine with declining efficacy without so much as a question?  Are you planning on getting a 4th jab when it comes out?   Google the Milgram experiment.  Fauci is the man in the white lab coat that people are listening to since he fulfills you're expectations of what an authority figure ***SHOULD*** look like not because of any exceptional knowledge he's displayed. 

 I'm curious about you though, how has Covid changed you?  Frankly, you seemed to be somewhat fearful of entertaining any opposing ideas.  Has Covid made you more or less nervous?

Assuming that no additional variants develop, like the flu?  Maybe.  Frankly, I'm not clicking through to substack, as I just don't see it as a reputable source.

Anti-vax is a useful term.  It denotes someone who does not understand science (or math, maybe) and who does not face reality when presented with evidence.  It is akin to anti-science.  It should undermine the person it is being used to describe.  Their rejection of our shared reality based in scientific method and experimental verification is a serious problem when it puts other people's lives at risk.  Look no further than the measles vaccine resistance movement to understand what I'm talking about.  Anti-vax thinking is lazy, and magical at the same time.  If you have covid, you don't go to your local homeopathy practitioner.  You go to the hospital, where science has developed the means to treat you.  You don't trust echinacea will prevent covid, you get the vaccine, you wear a mask, and you distance.  

As far as it being simplistic: it's simplistic in that the description and stigma attached is deserved and useful.  Being ""anti-vax"" is not a socially or personally responsible behavior.  It cuts the bullcrap and points out the basic lack of ability to process reality with any kind of a critical reasoning faculty. 

I don't know what you are getting at about big pharma presenting science, so maybe you could expand that thought a bit.

RFK, jr. is anti-vax.  He pushed the vaccine-autism link bs, for goodness sake!  RFK, jr. is the dumbest Kennedy yet.  It's impossible for me to understand how he could be related to JFK and RFK and Teddy.   They are lions versus a kitten on catnip in comparison.  

I had a discussion a while ago about truffle salt.  It went something like this:

""There's no such thing as truffle salt!"" I screamed.  ""Truffles don't make salt.  There are sodium salts, there are aluminum salts, there are potassium salts.  There is no such thing as truffle salt."" 

""But there is truffle salt. google it."" came the calm reply.

Now strictly speaking, truffles do not make salt chemically.  But truffle salt is a combination of truffles and table salt.  The table salt is not composed of TruffleCl, it is NaCl.  It's not truffle salt.  

So now I'm the only one in the world who says there's no such thing as truffle salt, while there are piles of truffle salt wherever you care to look.  Everyone else calls truffle salt truffle salt.  Is it useful to say that truffle salt does not exist if everyone else says it does?  Of course not.  It's insanity.

"> It's important to note that the claim of the vaccine ""protects you from severe hospitalization"" does not hold up in this case.

That is incorrect.  The vaccine certainly protects against ""severe hospitalization"" (whatever that is) if the vaccinated are being hospitalized at 1/6th the rate of the unvaccinated.

> That was something that came up when they changed the definition of immunity. (That was a gigantic tell by the way) I don't think I said the vaccine doesn't provide some measure of protection. 

Again, you stated that the vaccine didn't work and then would only accept a definition of ""working"" as being 95% effective against any symptoms.  If that's your definition of ""working"" and ""effective"" then, well, I can't argue with you.

> *they* [emphasis mine] changed the definition of immunity.

Who are *they*?  What was the definition of immunity?  What did they change it to?

>For me the risk/benefit isn't there.

Ok.

> Since, I've already had Covid, the risk (small as it is) from vaccine injury is actually higher than if I had never caught it.

It's interesting to me that you'll say that the vaccines only protect (well) against an earlier strain but that you, having presumably had only one strain yourself, are now immune to all variants.   The risk/benefit for you may be not there for you, given your apparent beliefs on the vaccines.  However, you must be aware that you are still vulnerable (and increasingly vulnerable as time passes and your body's immune response fades and new variants emerge) to re-infection?

> Wolensky said yesterday that 75% of the Covid deaths had at least 4 comorbidities. 75 percent!!!!!. 

If that's true, that's an incredible statistic.  I've looked for verification of those numbers in any source I have access to, and I don't see how she arrived at that conclusion.  I see the CDC death statistics say that only 5% of deaths say there are no contributing comorbidities, but they are terms like, ""Influenza and pneumonia."", ""Respiratory failure"", ""Respiratory arrest""  that more describe the manner in which the patient died rather than saying with certainty that covid preys on people with respiratory failure or respiratory arrest, for instance.  Until I see otherwise, and given the CDC's long-term leadership problems, I'm going to have to attribute that statistic to misunderstanding, misquoting, or misspeaking.

Edit after 20 minutes: I found in the Washington Post some additional context for Wolensky's statement.  ""75% of *vaccinated* people who die with covid die with at least 4 comorbidities.""  That's saying that if you have four comorbidities, even the vaccine isn't going to do you much good.  Way better to avoid getting sick in the first place.  Those comorbidities are not the cause of 75% of *all* deaths, but are present in at least 75% of those who die vaccinated.  This also says that if you have less than four comorbidities and have been vaccinated, you are more likely to not die with covid.

> The main error most people have made is that they expected all of the regulating agencies to tell the truth. While you can't outright say the lied, they have definitely misrepresented the efficacy of the vaccines and downplayed early treatment. 

I'm not sure who ""most people"" is, nor why this is part of your discussion, but given the novelty of the virus and the lack of knowledge surrounding it, it seems pretty unreasonable for experts to know everything about it and how it will behave in a human population as soon as it enters circulation.  There's going to be a bit of a learning curve.  That said, Trump did a huge disservice with his press conferences and his desire to soft-peddle the reality on the ground.  Frankly, I have no idea how he recovered from the bleach/disinfectant/UV flashlight up the ass episode, and it really sets a tone when you sharpie-up a weather map and castigate the weather service.

Ontario has at least 6 times as many fully vaccinated people as unvaccinated people (data is from the same website).

If the vaccination were having no effect, they would be in the ICU in numbers roughly proportional.  So today, 1/7, they show: 119 Unvaccinated in ICU, and 106 Vaccinated.  82% of Ontarians are fully vaccinated, while 12% are unvaccinated.  If the vaccines were inffective, and there were 119 Unvaccinated people in ICU in Ontario, one would expect there to be 813 fully vaccinated people in ICU.  There are only 106.

The impact of not having enough monoclonal antibodies on hand will certainly be felt in the early stages of the Pandemic as well as now that their is a shortage do to the current Administrations mishandling of their access.  They need better analysis of the data.  

BTW. I've never said vaccines don't provide some effect but they are certainly declining in efficacy and provide only short-lived immunity.  The ""vaccines"" are really therapeutics since you need to keep getting boosters for effectiveness.  They literally had to change the definition of immunity to support their usage.

"They vaccines are potentially efficacious against a specific strain of the virus. The level of efficacy is determined by the trial outcomes. Unfortunately, the trials are often manipulated.  This is where the absolute vs. relative risk conversation comes in.    

The jab probably worked against the Alpha variant but declined against Delta.   Just like the flu, as the virus mutates the efficacy will decline, it's obvious that is what's happening now.  

Here is the kicker, early data suggests that people with 3 jabs are displaying n*egative efficacy*.  In other words if you are double and triple jabbed you will more likely catch Omicron vs. an unvaccinated person. Fortunately, Omicron appears to a milder form of the virus that doesn't appear to be damaging to the lungs as were the other strains.

So why doesn't the media report on this?  A couple of guesses.  Fear sells, there is an old saying in journalism: ""If it bleeds it leads""  Fear drives clicks and eyeballs which in turn drive ad revenue.  Mainstream media is dependent on Big Pharma ad revenue.  Count the number of commercials you see for various drugs.  They are paying top dollar to media outlets with declining viewership and crappy balance sheets. Can an advertiser get a negative story spiked on a big TV network.  Happens all of the time.

I'll get back to you on the myocarditis issue.  That story is getting worse as time goes on.  It's also important to calculate the absolute vs. relative risk particularly in young men before making this decisions.  In other words is *my* (relative) risk for myocarditis worse or better than catching and dying from Covid.  Both might be small but one is a certain risk, meaning you can't undo the jab, the other only occurs if you catch Covid, which is not a 100% sure thing.",t2_9rec92c6,Reasonable_Active617,0,1641309610.0,0,t1_hr7zry1,hr7zry1,False,6poolyourheart,t3_rsuvym,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/rsuvym/for_harford_a_year_of_turmoil_over_covid/,"For Harford, a year of turmoil over COVID restrictions ends with its hospitals declaring a state of disaster",/r/harfordcountymd/comments/rsuvym/for_harford_a_year_of_turmoil_over_covid/hr7zry1/,1,r/harfordcountymd,0,1
"Re: CDC and Vaccine Budgets

This is from HHS budget for 2018. (CDC falls under HHS Health and Human Services) This was the easiest one to see the actual vaccine program contribution.   I doubt it will change appreciably over the subsequent years. The trend as you can see is upward, so if it did change it's most likely larger.  

[https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2018/budget-in-brief/cdc/index.html](https://www.hhs.gov/about/budget/fy2018/budget-in-brief/cdc/index.html)

Below is a link to the vaccine price list directly off of their website.  

[https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/awardees/vaccine-management/price-list/index.html)

My guess is the vaccine program started out as a GSA like procurement vehicle. GSA (General Services Administration) maintains a commodity pricing schedule that government uses to speed up procurements.  If a government agency can find a commodity on the schedule, they can procure it without having to go through a sometimes costly and time consuming procurement.  I don't believe a program like this got started with nefarious  profit making intentions but due to lack of oversight it sure seem it's ended up that way.   (I used to sell to State and Local and Federal Government. 

Were people healthier in the 70s?  I have nothing but anecdotal evidence.  I grew up in the 70's so I'm probably closer to your Mom's age.  I don't remember a single friend of mine that was obese.   I can only remember one kid from high school that was on any type of medication.  (Adderall).  I'm not saying this to dump on people who are obese are or taking medications, I just think the change is unusually significant.  There is something systemically wrong for the behavior of an entire population to change in significant way.  Where are the big health agencies on this?  Crickets.  

Regarding RFK Jr:  

If you told me 10 years ago that I would be touting a book he had written I wouldn't have believed it.   I am more libertarian than I am liberal so he is generally on the opposite end of the political spectrum.  However, I do have an open mind.  If you buy into the Vax vs. Anti-vax argument you are removing the ability to question anything that the CDC does with regard to vaccines.  There is so much money involved Big Pharma is not above planting articles in major newspapers and Medical Journals to change the public's opinion.  I wouldn't let the anti-vax moniker stop me from considering a different opinion.  The mainstream media is too homogenized and dependent on ad revenue to do real investigative reporting any more.  

Dopesick (Hulu)  It does a good job of showing how one company manipulated public opinion on the ""Pain epidemic"" to fuel the Opioid crisis.

https://twitter.com/ianmSC/status/1477728364127404033

The right hand side of the curve, after the mask mandates and lockdowns is what happens when they are not in place.  I'm unclear: were you trying to provide support for mandates?

> I'm guessing you have a job that remains unaffected by lockdowns so you haven't noticed but it's severely harmed small businesses.

Lol.  You don't know me at all.

> Do the vaccines have side effects? Every medical procedure has side effects, this one is no different.

In the overwhelming number of vaccinations , the end result is the intended result.  The risks associated with vaccination (and subsequent vaccinated illness) are far lower than those associated with unvaccinated illness.  


> Canadian Doctors

Lol.  Cowards who won't publish their names for fear of ridicule or consequence of passing junk science off as gospel.  Their videos and pamphlets are about 10% science, 60% exaggeration, and 30% anti-vaxx propaganda.

You've presented no evidence at all.  If your ""alternate viewpoint"" is unsubstantiated anti-vaxx paranoia, you are correct, I'll be numb to it.



> Are you aware of the very disturbing signals of myocarditis in people who have been vaccinated?


2265 reported cases.  Out of 500,000,000 shots administered.  And most are not fatal.  You are more likely to be struck by lightning than to die by vaccine induced myocarditis.


> The smugness and moral superiority of the Vax enthusiasts is really the worst part of all this. To think that you would risk the lives of children to lower your own risk in such a marginal fashion is really stomach churning and delusional. 

Pot, meet kettle.

For what it is worth, I'm not in favor of focussing vaccination efforts on children.  But not out of fear of the risks of the vaccine side effects, which even in children is far outweighed by the benefits.  The greatest bang for the buck in terms of reducing hospital overwhelm is to vaccinate those 50 and older.  That gets lost in the desire to protect children.  Kids going to school where they exchange viruses like pokemon cards is intuitively easy to advocate for, but it isn't as useful to hospitals.  It still reduces the risk to the kids, but for every kid it keeps out of the hospital, ten or fifteen adults might have been kept out.

It really is an eye opener.  There is a river of cash that flows from the regulating agencies to the researchers and universities to develop the drugs and vaccines.

* The social distancing of 6  feet was an arbitrary number.  There was no scientific basis for it.   Does staying away from everyone reduce the transmission rate? Yes, of course but what are there downsides to locking everything up.  There are also social consequences to the lockdowns.  I'm guessing you have a job that remains unaffected by lockdowns so you haven't noticed but it's severely harmed small businesses.  Suicides and drug abuse are way up.  Do you understand a simple cost/benefit analysis?
* Do the vaccines have side effects?  *Every medical procedure has side effects, this one is no different.*  It's an extremely narcissistic view point to vaccinate children using the false notion of ""protecting others""  If we go nationwide with this mass vaccination campaign on children, it will likely cause thousands of deaths and lifelong disabilities.   Are you aware of the very disturbing signals of myocarditis in people who have been vaccinated? Blissfully unaware I would bet.   Do we know if this occurs in adults?  It's tough to tell because adults are always dying from heart and strokes, so it makes uncovering these events very difficult.   My guess is it is occurring, it's just under reported.  

The link below is to a video about Phizer's vaccine effectiveness.  Do you know the difference between absolute risk and relative risk? Most Doctor's can't even tell you. The video was produced by a group of Canadian Doctors that have serious concerns about the Phizer vaccine.  Should we listen to them or to financially conflicted bureaucrats? The video discusses this along with data on ""all cause mortality""  It is very disturbing. FYI..Phizer has many examples of criminality in the past.  With that in mind, we should be taking everything they say with a grain of salt.

If no mitigation measures are taken, then you get hospitals that are in ""crisis"".  If mitigation measures are taken, then the spread of the disease happens less quickly.  Maybe everyone gets it eventually, but over the course of the disease more people who need the care are able to be cared for by hospitals, reducing overall death toll.

Seems like they reduce the risk of death and hospitalization from the disease.  It's not a perfect solution, but it's better than getting sick without having had it.  If you look at the last 6 months of death per population vs. vaccination rate by county, you'll see a vast difference in the death rates from the disease.

"I'm not sure what you found so compelling about this article, it contains very little hard information just a lot of innuendo and supposition.  This is activist journalism, it's done to convince (scare you) into believing we're having a crisis at the hospital.  There was no evidence presented in the article that this was the case.  

The hospitals are ""self declaring"" a disaster.  How many patients are in ICU?  The author never bothers to ask the question.  Is it a staffing problem? Who knows, didn't ask.  You need nurses to staff the ICU beds, if you don't have enough nurses it negatively impacts your ICU bed count.

""And now, in the winter of Harford County’s discontented year, its largest hospital was the first in the state to ***self-declare a disaster.*** Prompted by a spike in COVID patients, the designation issued Christmas Eve allows the University of Maryland Medical System’s Upper Chesapeake Medical Center in Bel Air to reduce nonurgent surgeries and shift staffing, patients and resources. The county’s other hospital, Harford Memorial Hospital, followed suit Tuesday.""  FYI I believe all of the hospitals declaring a crisis are in the UMMS system. 

This sounds politically motivated:

*""The county council recently voted against mandating masks at its meetings, for example, and in September wrote Upper Chesapeake officials to ask that they reconsider a vaccination mandate for employees""*

How does this person know what people are thinking?  Maybe he should be investigating why the double-vaxxed and boostered are catching Covid?  Does the title ""senior scholar"" means his an expert on the opinions of people who live in Harford County?

*“They have no one to blame but themselves,” said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.  (Bull$hit Statment)*

""Arikan said people need to keep themselves safe. *The hospital crisis, she said, is due to smaller capacities and preexisting staffing shortages* that *in part stem from some employees quitting when the vaccine mandate took effect.""*  **Who actually created the problem?**  Did it really make sense require health workers who've worked during the entire pandemic to be vaccinated considering many of them may have already had Covid?   UMMS stepped on a banana peel and is now blaming the public for it.   The multi-million dollar CEO is still getting paid though.  

Another dubious statement:

*At ExpressCare, the line grew to about 50 people by the time it opened at 9 a.m. Still, Davis was determined to get tested to protect others.*  The vaccine doesn't stop you from catching or spreading the virus?  Who is she protecting?  Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the CDC said as much back in August.

"Welcome.  Also, are you specifically looking for HdG & Bel Air because of their ""downtown"" areas?  I know they have a lot of night life and a small town feel (everybody who goes to the bars knows everybody else), but given the geography and what's in between, I assumed that was the case.  

If not, then would suggest checking out Aberdeen & Belcamp as well.  Obviously you don't have those downtown areas (Aberdeen *kind of* does but it's not comprable), but you can often find more affordable housing and Aberdeen specifically is developed to the point where you are never more than a couple minute car ride from pretty much every modern comfort/restaurants/movie theatre/etc.  
To compare prices, you can get a 2br house in Aberdeen for what you'd get a 1br apartment for in Bel Air.  Example:

"> APG

>For much of its 95-year history, APG was known as a test and evaluation facility for the Army and home to ordnance troops. More recently, because of the Base Realignment and Closure Act of 2005 and other factors, APG evolved into a hub of research, development, and test and evaluation activity for the joint services. Not only has the installation grown larger, its role among military bases changed. Considered by military leaders as a ""megabase,"" APG serves as a premiere center for science and technology.

"I used window world. They are right in bel air across from the mill. 

They can come to you and measure. I have been slowly doing windows in my home.  Window world seemed really nice.  I had like a 12k contract with them and then disaster struck and I canceled it. They were understanding and no pressure.  

I then went back to them and got 3 windows so far.  I plan to do more, but can only afford so much.  

Generally windows end up being about 500$ a window. You can sometimes get prices around 350 a window.  I got their middle grade windows.  

I am unsure about some other windows in my house as they are old wooden windows that are actually ok, just need to be reglazed which I can do myself. My house is over 100 years old and I am a member of /r/centuryhomes

But I have some that were probably put in in the 1980s so they are next on the replace list.  It's ironic that the 100 year plus windows are in some of the best condition and the ""replacements"" that were done in the 80s and early 2000s are bad.

Bartenfelder and Waste Industries are the 2 big ones. Both suck. Bartenfelder sucks a little bit less. They’ll provide you cans, make sure they give you 96 gallon cans and not the smaller 55 gallon ones.

"One of the squatters, Tessa Mona Modiri (who calls herself a “noncitizen national”), filed a complaint in early June alleging the homeowner and her mortgage company are fraudulently using a third-party real estate agency to short sell the property. A short sale, which is legal under a process specified in state law, is when a bank allows an owner sell a residence for less than the person owes on the home’s mortgage.

The homeowner denies the allegations.

Modiri filed a similar civil complaint June 14 attempting to take ownership of a foreclosed commercial property in Harford County, according to court records.

...

Modiri filed a similar civil complaint June 14 attempting to take ownership of a foreclosed commercial property in Harford County, according to court records.

In her complaint in Baltimore County, Modiri asserts the property belongs to her since she gained access to the home through a broken back door, concluding it “was clearly abandoned.”

Court records list a Bel Air address for Modiri that’s shared with Renu Medspa, which offers Botox, chemical peels and other cosmetic services. Its website describes Modiri as a Bel Air dentist. A Tessa M. Modiri of Bel Air has an active dentist’s license with the Maryland State Board of Dental Examiners.

Modiri did not return a message sent to a number associated with her business and efforts to reach her at a workplace address were unsuccessful. The other occupants of the home also could not be reached.

... 

Online court records show police arrested Modiri on Wednesday and that she’s been indicted on burglary charges.

"Welcome to Harford County! It must have been difficult leaving your friends and family behind. I actually arrived here almost 3 years ago to work at APG. In order to maintain OPSEC we can resort to PMs if you prefer. For starters I'm a 31 year old male, turning 32 this month. I like video games, sports, movies, card games, Marvel/DC, anime, board games, etc. 

Everyone here has provided a wealth of information for you and once you arrive at your job I'm sure your coworkers can also recommend some things to do/groups to join. It really depends on what you're trying to do. My wife and I could probably recommend you to places to eat and shop for starters. We're actually still trying to discover the area as well. COVID really put a damper on our plans.

If I had to recommend a place it would be a shopping mall in Delaware, known as Christiana Mall. Delaware is a tax free and beautiful state. It's about a 1 hour drive; less if you use tolls.

"I'm not buying that story for one second. When I originally looked into these purple lights, i stumbled across several short news clips from different cities in different states, and they all had the same exact word-for-word narrative about why the lights were purple.  When I hear several news stations repeating the exact same script, I know it's a bought n paid for narrative that they are contractually obligated to tell everyone. 

Secondly,  using my own critical thought skills, I have an extremely hard time believing that these brand new lights being put up everywhere all have some manufacture defect.  According to the script from the news outlets, the manufactured defect happened as the lights aged, and somehow went bad and turned purple in the process. But in my neighborhood, all these lights are brand new, freshly installed.  Am I suppose to believe that they installed light bulbs that were already several years old? I doubt that. 

And lastly, if you do just a few minutes of your own research, you can quickly and easily find out more information about smart street lights and smart city grids, and you'll see what these new lights are really capable of.

"I know I'm late in responding to this post, but these are all over my neighborhood too, and I'm really upset about it. I saw someone post about these on some neighborhood app recently, and so I went on to do my own research, and the implications are disturbing to say the least. These new streetlights look identical to the ""smart"" street lights I found while searching the internet. If they are the same models, that means they're capable of recording audio and video and constantly transmitting 2 way data. That would also mean these things are hooked up to their own internet grid, and I suspect the purple color of the bulbs is a special light that would make it easier to record things at night. 

But anyway, after spending a few hours online and watching many presentations on youtube from different people and companies pitching the idea of smart cities and ""Lifi"" (instead of wifi), I'm convinced that's what is happening here in our area.

"The comments I made were more about social issues and not at all racist.  As a society, we have seen the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.  That goes for the school system as well. For example, years ago, there were parts of Fallston who were redistricting to Edgewood due to overcrowding. The Fallston community put up such a protest about it, the elected government officials decided to build a new high school, Patterson Mill.  That decision absolutely crushed the Harford County education budget for a decade hurting the poorer schools worse. My child went to Aberdeen High and saw things daily that are beyond comprehension, including teachers being assaulted. I would think that HDG would be acceptable to teach as it has a strong ""sense of place"". I do believe that schools on the lower economic scales are a more difficult environment.  I also believe that teachers pay should reflect that to keep teachers from transferring and recognizing the issues present. More experienced teachers transfer all the time to what they consider a better school hurting the kids and the system.  I am just saying hold out and get yourself into the best situation possible.

"Route 40 school (I believe) are Edgewood, Aberdeen, Joppa, and HDG.

I can't speak much about any of the schools other than HDG because I know a lot of kids from that school who have become life long friends.

the term route 40 schools is sometimes seen as a racist dog whistle as they have more black students.  I'm not saying that is what the original poster is saying, but they are often times viewed as schools that are inferior or not as good. 
 Edgewood/Joppa/Aberdeen often have lowest standardized test scores, which might lead to this negative association.

"I agree that some may use the opportunity to express their individuality and sanctity of self. I'd also propose that many graduates would just put phrases such as ""Ballz deep in WAP!"" on their caps, which I admit would be fun to hear being explained to the grandparents. 

So in this case, I'm sure the rule has a lot more to do with the difficulty of determining what is ""too far"" in a time sensitive situation, and less to do with stifling rights and creativity.

School administrators having to make a game time decision to allow a cap with an inappropriate message - assuming they get all the jokes and don't mistakenly allow something that will make them look even worse - vs having a student not walk across the stage (assuming they do not have an extra cap available for each student) is just asking for trouble.

So the easiest course of action is to just say no. No customization of the caps makes life easier for all.  After all, maybe a ceremony that is a big deal for 399 other students and their families is not the place to express yourself and make everyone's day all about you.",t2_pzs9g,DanV410,0,1618326845.0,0,t1_gudn8lp,gudn8lp,False,[deleted],t3_mpokid,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/mpokid/petition_to_hcps_to_allow_seniors_to_decorate/,Petition to HCPS to allow seniors to decorate graduation caps.

"Less people are getting tested. I’ve asked two government sources and no one has given me a daily count on testing. So, I’m taking it upon myself to find one. 

The way stats are being done are driving me insane. X out of 100,000...is that just a number derived from the 9.5%? 

The fact is that less people are being tested and I thing only people that *really* think they have it are getting tested. Partially thanks to the vaccine rollout. For example, we had two similar situations: exposed to a person who tested positive within two days of seeing us. First time (January) we got tested, second time (a couple of weeks ago) we didn’t. We already had shot one and that provides 52-80% efficacy depending on the manufacturer.

"Good stuff.  Like I said before, I really appreciate you responding and taking the time.  This has definitely put my mind at ease with an already stressful and overwhelming process to get moving as is anyway.  I know mine would be a year lease, assuming that I wouldn't renew beyond that.  

Thanks again!  Appreciate all of the intel... I know it'll differ some based on the actual unit and neighbors themselves but I read from most folks that it is relatively quiet, even with consideration of the floorboards.  Just going to be a whole new lifestyle change for me on multiple levels.  So, nothing to it but to do it I guess.

"> How are the neighbors for you? Relatively respectful and quiet? 

It is actually kind of funny you ask that because in a month period we had 4 neighbors move out of our block.  We thought we had missed the memo, but I think all their leases ended around the same time.  3/4 of them were elderly, and the other was a family of four.  The new neighbors have kept to themselves so far but no issues in the first few weeks. Generally people have been quiet, but its going to be different depending on the neighbor's themselves.

I will say that the floodboards are super creaky.  We feel bad since we leave early for work now and are up at odd hours sometimes.  It isn't super bad, but it can be noticeable.  Not sure its a problem everywhere, but I assume it is in the units that haven't really been updated.

I am pretty sure most units are on a year lease at minimum.

We have a W/D that are relatively new.  I did forget to mention that the unit above us had a small leak from their shower one day.  It was a weekend and we called the emergency line.  They sent someone out immediately to get it fixed.  Luckily it dripped into our shower and wasn't major.  They couldn't recreate the problem, but I have a feeling it was user error somehow.  The unit above has since moved out and we haven't had issues since.",t2_b2lnjjff,mdharco222,0,1616443877.0,0,t1_grumb4k,grumb4k,False,KosmoKoehler,t3_matps1,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/matps1/hickory_hills/,Hickory Hills,/r/harfordcountymd/comments/matps1/hickory_hills/grumb4k/,2,r/harfordcountymd,0,2
"Yeah and honestly - I'm hoping this is a short-term thing anyways, year lease or so at best.  I think overall I'm in the same boat as you - looking for the best overall value, considering my financial situation and personal situation unfortunately.  Just gotta make the best of the little things.  

My biggest things were having a W/D in the unit, relatively quiet and respectful community, safety, all of that good stuff for the kids.  This will serve as more of an in between stage I'm hoping for me but we'll see how that goes... How are the neighbors for you?

"I think it is an upgrade from most areas in Abingdon, since the closer you are to 95, the sketchier it can get (generally speaking of course).  

The units themselves are all going to be different look different.  My unit has old, outdated brown kitchen cabinets, and the kitchen counters have some stains.  The bathroom is also very outdated. Again, for the value it isn't something we are concerned with.  We have never had an issue with bugs, rodents, etc, but that could be different in other buildings.  Also, since there are rental companies buying up properties as owners leave, the units might look different based off what the owner did to it.  The should be able to tell you what it looks like before you move in. 

So there is really no solid answer to your question unfortunately, but ask before you move in.  We are looking to move at the end of the semester, but only because we want more space and a yard if possible.  No real complaints of the unit/area in a year and a half.

That's relieving to hear!  Thanks for taking the time to respond!  It'll be me and 2 younger boys (8 and 6 y/o) so that sounds about what I'm looking for.  Not expecting anything extravagant - currently residing in Abingdon but trying to stay fairly close.  Anything I end up with because of income is gonna be a downgrade and I've accepted that.

"Throwaway account, but I have lived there for over a year.  It is a pretty quiet community.  The Condo Association can be dicks about what you have on the balconies/patios/windows, but they are great with the general upkeep of the community.  It is clean, and they are on top of cleaning up debris, snow removal, etc.

The population of the community itself is a mixed bag.  Lots of elderly/older people with a healthy mix of families/younger people.  There is an occasional cop car/ambulance in the community, but we have never felt unsafe.  There seems to be a steady influx of people moving in and out, but I don't think it's necessarily a bad indication of anything.  Also, all the rentals have different landlords, so your actual experience with the landlord will vary.

"My family members were ELIGIBLE under the current MD vaccine guidelines too! They never gave those that were turned away the chance to have their eligibility verified via the health check list. This list was used for others before those people were given a shot.  We pleaded w/ multiple people. They had no explanation for y the site gave confirmations if it wasn’t supposed to. How would the public know a confirmation is valid or not? Y would some people b allowed to get the shot & others not b allowed to get the shot if they never even checked the individual’s health eligibility? We input all of our personal information, health info- showing that we were eligible, age, etc... That is y we assumed we were given a confirmation and that it was valid. It didn’t matter. At some point in the afternoon after 1ish, people started being turned away. They sent u this notice, but I know elderly people that were turned away yesterday too. There was no reason for them to b rude, threatening, or not offer any explanation as to y their system allowed people to be given an appointment. They r trying to say that people are responsible for not using the site correctly, but they had lists of every person’s name who had an appointment. They knew how many people were going to be there before the clinic started. Someone had to print multiple copies of the lists. Of course, I was not allowed to view my own name & information on these lists. I don’t think it is unreasonable for someone to have counted the number of names & counted the number of vaccines available that day. Nor do I think it is unreasonable to trust a government health site that schedules vaccine appointments to be able to match available appointments with the number of vaccines available for that clinic on that day. I am sorry that you were unable to get a vaccine. We have tried to get appointments elsewhere. We have signed up for vaccine appointment notifications w/ Giant, CVS, Walgreens, Rite-Aid, MD.gov, Harford Co. health dept, & the VA. I have been trying to get vaccinations for our family members since they were first being offered- to no avail. We have several qualifying health conditions.

The COVID-19 Vaccine Clinic at Patterson Mill School for March 5, 2021 is cancelled. The only activities at Patterson Mill campus tomorrow will be activities conducted by the school system. 
We had to cancel the clinic because 90% of the registered slots had been taken by people who were not invited and are not in the currently eligible priority group.
We have identified you as someone who registered without having been invited.  Please wait your turn.

Using shared links has led to extreme inconvenience and unnecessary risk for thousands of your fellow citizens who are at high priority for vaccination.  People over 75 are ten times more likely to die of COVID-19 then people under 60.

DO NOT COME TO PATTERSON MILL SCHOOL CAMPUS TOMORROW.

Their order tracker showed their order as having been delivered, but it was not.  And they were unable to get ahold of customer service to correct it.

"Nice enough area, but almost right on the line of “not so nice”. In harford county, i95 is a pretty much the dividing line. For the most part, north of 95 is nice, south is not. Abingdon exists on both sides, so there is some spillover of people out and about. 

If you want to get away from that completely, but still want to be close to things, I’d suggest Hickory area. 

Dealing with service workers and such in hickory vs abingdon is like a night and day difference. I’ve lived in both areas.

"> Legislation to allow community solar energy systems in Harford County was met with largely favorable views from the public, which weighed in on the bill at a recent meeting of the Harford County Council.  
>  
>The comments Feb. 2 were mostly positive, but multiple people recommended amending the legislation to allow the systems on residential land, arguing they could relieve development pressure and benefit county residents in a way that does not permanently develop or change the land.  
>  
>Introduced at the request of County Executive Barry Glassman, the legislation would allow solar power generating panels to be put on several types of land to provide power to those in the county — as long as the system does not exceed two megawatts, according to the bill.  
>  
>According to the legislation, the community solar systems would be permitted in most residential and business zoning classifications — with special development conditions — except those designated rural residential and agricultural, among some others They could not be placed on conserved land or preservation easements, and there are minimum required lot sizes for the projects in each zoning classification.  
>  
>Deputy director of planning and zoning David Culver said a two-megawatt system covers about eight to 10 acres of land. A system that size could supply power to about 800 homes, he said, depending on siting, the type of system and the energy efficiency of homes the power flows to.  
>  
>The systems would come with restrictions. No energy-generating structures are permitted closer than 150 feet from a property line or closer than 200 feet from a dwelling, the bill states. Systems’ heights, too, would be regulated to 15 feet, and the systems would require landscape buffering and fences at least 6 feet high. They are also not permitted to pose a glare hazard, according to the legislation.  
>  
>Decommissioning regulations are also written into the bill to guarantee restoration of the land once a facility has exceeded its useful lifespan. Solar systems generally last for 20 years, Culver said.  
>  
>In 2019, Maryland’s legislature mandated that 50% of the state’s electricity retail sales come from renewable energy sources by 2030. County spokesperson Cindy Mumby explained that 15% of that has to be solar power.  
>  
>Councilman Robert Wagner questioned why the panels would not be allowed on properties zoned for agricultural and rural residential uses, as did Councilman Andre Johnson. Wagner pointed out that the rural residential properties typically have larger lots, while some business and other residential properties are smaller. They raised the issue of agricultural users getting power without needing to have the panels on their properties.  
>  
>“If it is going to be on the backs of the people that are in or near the development envelope, and then it is going to also benefit the people outside of that area, then I do not know if folks that have it in their backyards within that development envelope are going to necessarily like those particular solar panels,” Johnson said.  
>  
>Culver told the council that the agriculture and rural residential classifications were excluded from the list of permitted zoning classifications because the county was trying to protect farmland. Besides that, the facilities will not only appear in the development envelope; there are a number of places outside of it that could host community solar systems.  
>  
>“The \[agriculture\] district, we were trying to protect the valuable farmland,” Culver said.  
>  
>Public comments on the legislation were generally positive as people, including several who work in the solar energy business, called in to commend the bill.  
>  
>Stephanie Flasch, president of Friends of Harford, a group advocating for responsible land use, said the organization approves of the bill with amendments, including allowing those community solar projects on agricultural land. She said that conserved farmland could be excluded and protected in other ways, but solar facilities could make for good, temporary additions to farmland.  
>  
>“The addition of the agricultural district actually allows a use that does not destroy valuable property with permanent development,” she said.  
>  
>Flasch also recommended the county change the permitted use from a special development to a special exception, which would allow nearby property owners to give input on any proposed community solar installation close by.  
>  
>Franny Yuhas, an employee of Turning Point Energy, thanked Glassman and the county council for the legislative attention paid to the bill. She said solar projects benefit county residents in the form of construction jobs and savings on costs of electricity.  
>  
>Though the legislation was favorable, she said the required 150-foot buffer would be excessive and recommended against establishing minimum lot sizes for the projects. She also said a modest amount of farmland could be used for the projects.  
>  
>“It is a win-win for everyone,” she said.  
>  
>Jake Springer, senior policy associate for the solar energy company Nexamp, recommended using some agricultural land for the community system, saying that makes up the majority of the county’s land and area. The addition of community solar systems to farms, he said, could give them a steady source of income, which would allow them to resist pressures to sell their land for development.  
>  
>“Without its inclusion, I would expect community solar’s development to be very limited in the near-term,” Springer said. “For many landowners, hosting community solar is a revenue stream that allows them to resist more permanent development pressure.”  
>  
>The community solar legislation was mentioned during a December meeting hosted by the Maryland Public Service Commission on a proposed solar project in the Creswell area off Route 136.  
>  
>County officials and residents objected to the idea of a larger solar facility in the county, and then-director of Harford County’s department of planning and zoning Brad Killian said the legislation for smaller, community solar projects would be introduced to the council.  
>  
>The proposed solar project presented at the MPSC meeting would place photovoltaic panels on 140 acres of land at 2000 Calvary Road and generate 30 megawatts of power.  
>  
>Residents urged the location be reconsidered, and county government said the proposed project ran against its philosophy of land development and could upend decades of precedent in the county. Because Harford County has fewer and broader zoning classifications than comparable jurisdictions, the range of land uses for properties is more flexible. But that is tempered by governmental limiting of growth to specific areas, known as the development envelope.",t2_19zajr6b,LostSoul5,0,1612805055.0,0,t1_gmln4j5,gmln4j5,True,LostSoul5,t3_lfgqre,https://www.reddit.com/r/harfordcountymd/comments/lfgqre/community_solar_energy_legislation_gets_favorable/,Community solar energy legislation gets favorable response from Harford residents,/r/harfordcountymd/comments/lfgqre/community_solar_energy_legislation_gets_favorable/gmln4j5/,3,r/harfordcountymd,0,3
