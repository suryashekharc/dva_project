"Even some of us who have lived here all our lives aren't too disgruntled. I'm mostly just frustrated with the ""retirement"" scene, and Vernon being turned into more of a retirement town for vancouverites. But I really like living here.

Tons of camping and hiking/backpacking/mountain biking /outdoors stuff everywhere.

There are lots of gyms around, so if one doesn't work for ya then there's probably something out there .

There used to be a younger karaoke crew attending some bars like longhorn. I'm not sure what it's like now with COVID and what's left open though. 

The snow is hit or miss sometimes. Usually the road to Lake country is okay but that is the worse part of that highway when it doesn't get properly cleared. I don't think lessons are required but don't be afraid to carefully drive out to an empty parking lot in a park and just practice sliding In the snow to get the hang of it. And get winter tires.

"Howdy howdy! Been here just over a year and here's my rundown: 

1) If you've got winter tires and don't drive like an idiot you should be good to go. Driving to Lumby and Lake Country during the winter, winter tires are the law on those highways so if you do that you're already halfway there. 

2) The born and raised folks seem to think the town's on the boring side nightlife wise, but there's a restaurant or a bar for anyone. I think the club is opening up again soon, so that could bring a bit more to the downtown core on a Friday or Saturday. 

3) I am not a fisher but people definitely do both! 

4) I go to Fitness West and my gym rat boyfriend just switched to going there as well, speaks highly of having all the necessities and then some. I wish it was a little cheaper but the price is on par for every other gym in town I believe. 

5) The rental market is crazy, but I feel that's the case everywhere from the Okanagan to the Coast; keep your eyes peeled on Facebook marketplace and the classified sites and fingers crossed you can find a good place.

"If your outdoorsy, you are going to have such a great time. There are so many beautiful hikes, the lakes provide endless activities, Silverstar and Big White in the winter time, tons to do! 

Rent is going to be hard for sure, unless your willing to go for a basement suite with your landlord upstairs or rent a room in a shared house, but it‚Äôs definitely not impossible. I think most people 20-late 30s here rely on having a roommate or partner to make rent a bit less intense, but if you‚Äôve got the financial wiggle room to live solo then go for it!!

Winter driving isn‚Äôt too bad here, but the highway you‚Äôd drive for that commute can have some people that don‚Äôt know how to drive in the winter so if your worries about it for next year, even just for peace of mind some practice in winter conditions isn‚Äôt a bad call, although I‚Äôd just hit up a friend you make in the area instead of lessons. Just make sure that you feel comfortable in the rare event you hydro plane or what to do if you were to hit black ice and your good. 

The community is kind of a funny mishmash of different walks of life and perspectives like any little town, but I‚Äôd say generally people here are pretty friendly. Definitely there‚Äôs the anti-mandate crowd, I mean we live by kelowna, but in terms of LGBTQ acceptance or diversity, it‚Äôs a very welcoming town. I don‚Äôt go to the gym because I‚Äôm a slug, but I‚Äôve heard we have a CrossFit gym in town if lifting is your thing, and the CrossFit community will definitely provide new friends.

Either way, best of luck and hope you enjoy our little town! :)",t2_ahi24bkz,DeathBeforeDecaf4077,0,1646322498.0,0,t1_hz70wxu,hz70wxu,True,roosternoot,t3_t5rhyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vernon/comments/t5rhyt/moving_to_vernon/,Moving to Vernon,/r/Vernon/comments/t5rhyt/moving_to_vernon/hz70wxu/,3,r/Vernon,0,3

"Vernon, like all cities has it's good and bad. Driving out to Lumby and stuff can be snowy and treach at times, but it's really not that bad, winter tires and a defensive driving approach and you'll be fine. 
As for the nightlife, I believe it has gone quite downhill, the dance club closed etc... Mind you, there are pubs and lots of nice patios and stuff in the summer. The lakes in BC are amazing for fishing. There are many many fishable lakes within an hour radius of Vernon! I have seen people ice fishing on Swan lake this year...

As for the gyms, Rec centre is decent but if you like lifting, maybe Iron Heart might fit your style better. 
As for the rental market, no clue, I moved here last year and bought a place.
From what I've seen since I've been here, Vernon is quite a nice place to live recreationally, lots to do if you like the outdoors, swimming, biking, boating, paddleboarding or kayaking, skiing...ripping the scooters all over town in the summer is fun as well, I rarely drove my car last year!

 Only thing I can say I've found weird, is that there is definitely an air of negativity with the people of Vernon. They seem to be a very disgruntled, angry city.

Mostly permanent but many leave for the winter and head south . Not too many teenagers but there are some and many more in the spring / summer.

"FWD is fine until the road is bad or hasn‚Äôt been cleared from snow or ice. Yes, you can absolutely get by with FWD (I only got an AWD vehicle a couple of years ago once our first kid was due).

I‚Äôm not sure how steep the road at the Rise is, but when the snow is bad and hasn‚Äôt been cleared you can easily pick out the AWD from the FWD going up our hill.

"The Rise, as far as I know, is kept pretty well cleared of snow throughout the winter. There is not many paved roads in the Okanagan that need more than a FWD with good tires. There are times and spots, such as Westside road, where the roads are barely cleared and having AWD or studs help a lot. But even then not absolutely needed.

Keep in mind AWD helps you to get going, but it doesn't do any better than FWD when it comes to stopping.

Edit: I didn't think of this but confidence does play a role in feeling safe. When I drive a family member's AWD SUV in the snow I feel more confident, and can relax a bit more.

"Current employee, good place to work. Scheduling is a little juggled for the first 6 months to a year. Be prepared for graveyard shifts for months at a time. Cleanup isn‚Äôt that bad, mostly shoveling dry sawdust. Weekend cleanups a little harder (12 hour days) but good supervisors and crew for that shift. Sawmill is harder work, lumber isn‚Äôt dried yet so any jobs involving handling of wood are much harder than the planer plant (handling of the product dried). 1500$ bonus‚Äôs every quarter depending on a few factors can increase or decrease slightly. Nice little
helper. Lots of incentive on movement, pay increase every year, full benefits, first aid training incentives (paid training and 1$ raise). We are short handed lots with high turnover due to forklift operator turnover mostly on the finishing end. Planer starting job is either cleanup or strip rack operator (fairly easy job for 31$ / hour) sawmill starting jobs usually strip rack labourer (harder than starting roll at planer for sure) planer sounds like the place that will be taking most hires at the moment, get in while you can before student season rolls around and the place fills up with temporary hands for the summer.

Vernon has little affordable housing, substandard transit, less shelter beds than required on most nights, very few doctors that have been mandated to provide harm reduction services, and a gutless city council that continues to provide half-measures for a full-blown problem. 

Just a heads up to the ignorant people on here too: not every homeless person uses drugs at all or to the point of committing crimes for a fix, and not all criminal activity is by the homeless. 

People can get angry all they want. But anger doesn‚Äôt solve problems. Action solves problems. Educate yourself on how you help deter both criminality and homelessness before jumping on your soapbox to complain about Vernon‚Äôs crime problem or it‚Äôs homelessness problem.

"Hi there,

I just moved to Vernon from Ontario with my girlfriend 3 weeks ago. We were looking from mid Nov/ December and couldn't find a place but work was starting in Jan so we booked an airbnb for this month so we could be here to hunt for a rental locally.

After applying to the 5-10 ads we saw during the 2nd week, we got a viewing for a house and the landlords said they had over 3000 views on the ads and well over a hundred applications in only a few days of the ad being up.

We were lucky and they said we were the top pick mostly because we were a young couple with stable dual income. We ended up signing and move in February. 

They mentioned that it is so hard because so many applicants said they are living in airbnbs, hotels, renting out a room and sharing with others etc. It's very difficult and if you are single income you are already at a disadvantage in a tough housing market. 

We feel very fortunate but at the same time didn't have to experience the difficulties many locals have had to face for months, perhaps a year or 2 from what we've heard.

If you are able to lock down a place before the move, stick with that. Otherwise you may be in for a very unpleasant period of time searching.",t2_3o5ke6qm,TechBurnerr,0,1642732076.0,0,t1_htjmiz8,htjmiz8,True,[deleted],t3_s8ryqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vernon/comments/s8ryqh/thinking_of_moving/,Thinking of Moving,/r/Vernon/comments/s8ryqh/thinking_of_moving/htjmiz8/,6,r/Vernon,0,6

Mom made a vocal comment about a kid who was vaccinated and proud to wear a sticker to state as much.

Anyway, this mother a few days prior had felt the need to reprimand my daughters wonderful teacher about forcing her kid to wear a mask. I believe the kid wanted to wear it because most of the other kids were.. so he did. Mommy didn't like this and slammed the teacher.

"There is no labour shortage.  People **want** to work.  No one wants to sell half their waking life to a company whose pay won't cover rent.  Companies who pay, or at least treat their employees well, aren't having the same problems with workers; in fact, some have had record years.  


Bosses like to whinge about CERB, but they're more than happy to take handouts directly.  I never hear people moaning about incentives for small businesses.  


Working age folks have traditionally always left Vermin to start careers, then moved back when they were stable.  Vernon itself has always been amenable to that, citing the 'sunshine tax' as some nebulous excuse to artificially repress wages even more than they already are.  The housing crisis is continental, there isn't really anywhere to go, so there aren't really less working age people locally than ever.  The unequal division of wealth is very visible throughout the Okanagan, however.  


Our capital 'E' Economy is only propped up by criminally driven real estate gains, but it is ill.  The state of our actual economy is visible every time you look outside.  The number of people sleeping rough doubled last year.  RVs are clogging side streets because people can't live in houses.  Businesses suffer because the populous can't shop beyond necessities.  Benchmark price for a single detached still went up 30% last year.  


Most politicians are land barons, and only pay lip service to the housing crisis.  CERB saved many from homelessness during the shutdown.  That's what taxes are for, they are a return on the investment we all make in our country.  The Idea that corporations and real estate trusts are suddenly going to develop consciences is asinine.  Now that there is time to do things properly, the country needs to roll out a Universal Basic Income.  There is no better way to stimulate the small 'e' economy than putting money directly in the hands of people who need to spend it.

"It's insane and discouraging. I've been trying to find a place somewhere in Kelowna or Vernon since summer so I can go back to school and actually get a decent job, but the cost of rent and high demand for it is making it look impossible to do. I even had jobs ready to take me, but they knew about the housing issues and weren't hiring anyone that didn't have a place in the area. One place said they were already losing people that were moving out, and they even had someone interview from Vancouver but walked away because they thought rent was too expensive here.  

Currently I'm up by Salmon Arm, and there's places here that complain about worker shortage too, but no one wants to pay much more than minimum wage and part time. And here there's never been much for rentals, everything is reserved for 55+. The work force relies heavily on kids that still live at home because there's no way to sustain oneself with the work here.

"this is a sore spot for me so I like to point it out as often as possible.

When the contract was renegotiated with the province, AIM roads won. They're not doing a bad job, they're just following the rules of a really bad contract.

I've since lost it, but it was publicly available. You can review the absurdity of the contract for yourself.

""Provincial highways must be cleared of snow down to within 1 inch..... within 12 hours of snow fall stopping."" Was effectively one provision

That means if you get any amount of snow on a continuing basis, they don't need to clear the road below 1 inch. I believe the provision was no more than 3 inches during the course of a snow storm.

The provisions for side roads and non highways were even worse. 48 hours I think.

So yeah, you can blame AIM roads, but for the most part they're just doing the job as the government specified.

"I‚Äôm a manager at a different coffee chain, but coming as general advice I am always looking for someone friendly, someone who is a self starter (actively looks for tasks to do without being told), and someone I think wants to find friendship in their work with their customers and coworkers. It‚Äôs always a great idea to come in prepped with some examples of your leadership qualities, and I always love when the people I‚Äôm interviewing have questions for me too! So maybe stuff like ‚ÄúI know Tim Hortons is involved in a lot of charitable work, could you tell me more about that?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the customer base like here?‚Äù Just something that shows you are actively interested in the environment around the business :)

Also, the best piece of advice I ever received myself for going into an interview was this; you are going into a situation where you are the solution to the problem the interviewer has. They are interviewing you because they‚Äôre in need of workers, so they are rooting for you to succeed and be the candidate they‚Äôre looking for! We all tend to feel nervous because interviews feel like saying ‚Äúhi this is me, do you like me?‚Äù The reality is they totally like you, and the only reason they wouldn‚Äôt hire you would be due to the needs of their business. 

Best of luck, and update us after on how it went!!!

"Congrats on getting an interview! That is literally half the battle.

Listen to the questions carefully. Answer exactly what they have asked you. If you don‚Äôt understand the question, ask for clarification or to repeat the question.

Interviews will ask about your technical background (if you don‚Äôt have any, be honest. Demonstrate that you are willing to learn), social and behavioural question (how you work with people, how you handle conflict), and direct experience (work or personal). 

The direct experience can be big or small experiences but what you need to demonstrate is your ability to critically think and act appropriately.

The biggest thing to remember about the interview that this is an opportunity for you to sell yourself as THE CANDIDATE for the job. Don‚Äôt sell yourself short. Those interviewers have determined that you are AWESOME enough to get in the door for an interview. Remember that.

This is also an opportunity for yourself to interview the employer. You need to determine if this is an employer you are OK to work for.

One of my biggest peeve in an interview is when the candidate answer a question completely different from what we asked or if they provide us a general statement when we clearly asked for specific examples.

It is OK to be nervous. I still get nervous when I get interviewed and I have been successful at the end. Just take a deep breath. If you don‚Äôt get it, that is OK. Ask the HR person if you can get some feedback on what you can improve on. Most of the time, they will be open with you.

Good luck. If it counts, I‚Äôm rooting for you!

Landlord BC is a good website for the first year to get some good advice and tenant applications. It's  deductible.  If the renters are late with rent it doesn't get better. In my experience they will only get worse. Waiting for a good renter is better than getting someone to fill the unit. It is VERY hard to get rid of a bad renter.

"Perfect example is the cost of tuition. Back in the early 90s the average cost of tuition was just under $1,500 per year in Canada. Adjusting for inflation using the Bank of Canada's handy dandy inflation calculator makes that $2,700 in 2021 dollars. I have the receipts to prove that I paid more than triple that for a year's tuition for my degree. 

It's quite the coincidence that after a bunch of boomers got their cheap degrees and started making bank the price of tuition has increased so much. 

 http://www.ufcw.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3712:by-the-numbers-post-secondary-tuition-in-canada-an-expensive-journey&Itemid=6&lang=en

https://www.cbc.ca/news/undergraduate-tuition-fees-average-4-524-statscan-1.676496

Then nevermind housing costs. Back in the early 90s you could expect to pay off a house with approximately 200 weeks worth of labour and as of 2015, more than 400 weeks of labour is needed to purchase an average Canadian home. As per the article it's a bit more complicated and you can't exactly compare apples to apples since the type of property being purchased has also changed (e.g. avg sq ft 1000 to 2000), but it is acknowledged that for a millenial starting out, home ownership is a long and distant dream. 

https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/house-prices-canada-broadbent-1.3567723

Nevermind increased costs like childcare, labour unions hacked away, decrease in benefits like pensions, etc. It's pretty bad when my sister (a lawyer) and BIL (a teacher) are putting off having a second child because they're not sure if it will be affordable to spend almost $3,000/month in childcare costs. 

I was having a conversation with someone else about a different topic today (criminal justice), which I think applies here as well. With every policy choice there WILL be a cost to society. Whether that's higher taxes or social problems, society will collect. If it's the former, those costs will be felt by most on their paystub with taxes, but unfortunately, those costs will be borne by the younger generations. Once the boomers retire and switch to lower tax brackets, after they absconded their duty to build and maintain the system that they themselves benefited from, the newer generations will have to bear an even heavier burden.",t2_13jt3a,notthatpatrick,0,1630976912.0,0,t1_hbvkpui,hbvkpui,False,spankymustard,t3_piylgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vernon/comments/piylgs/will_mel_arnold_get_elected_again/,Will Mel Arnold get elected again?,/r/Vernon/comments/piylgs/will_mel_arnold_get_elected_again/hbvkpui/,12,r/Vernon,0,12

"How is personal responsibility missing from newer generations? Boomers have completely stacked the deck in their favour the last few decades after benefiting from years of government investment and then cutting those same benefits for the newer generations. Before, you could pay for a university degree working a minimum wage job and buy a house working a retail job. If you're a millenial with a university degree, buying a house is almost completely beyond reach, ESPECIALLY in the Okanagan.

For better of worse, society has changed, so it's not unreasonable to expect the government to change and fix the problems caused by years of cuts to social programs that have set newer generations further behind than ever before.

"I grew up in the area and returned here to have a family after living in Vancouver for about 10 years, so I am obviously quite biased. I‚Äôve now been living here again for about 15 years. 

Lumby is a fantastic place. The people are unpretentious and there is a real sense of community and caring for one another. Case in point- my dad is in his late 80s and has difficulty walking, but still insists on asserting his independence and going grocery shopping by himself. Without fail, someone will always approach him in the parking lot of the grocery store to help him put his groceries in his vehicle, return his cart for him, etc. This is just one example of how awesome the community is. 

My impression is also that Lumby has evolved quite a bit since the 80s and 90s when I grew up here. There are more younger people with families, many of whom seem to be consciously choosing to live an outdoor-oriented lifestyle, as opposed to living here due to financial constraints or other reasons, and who would rather be living elsewhere. In addition, Lumby also still has many honest, solid, hard-working people in the forestry and farming industries (and other careers too, of course). Many are the ‚Äúnext generation‚Äù, raising their own families now, which is really great to see. 

Does Lumby have its problems? Sure, like any community it does. But while it sounds cliched, it is the kind of place where you can get to know the names of the people in the community (if you want to be social) and people will actually say hello to you on the street or ask you how your family is doing at the checkout. Insert lyrics from a country song here‚Ä¶

In terms of flooding, in 2017 or so the province invested in a floodplain mapping study. Since then I believe a bunch of remedial work has been undertaken to address some of the flooding issues. My understanding is that there is work ongoing and that the Village has applied for (and possibly received) further funding to do even more work to address the flooding. 

I believe the flooding occurs mostly in the area near the Kal Tire on Shuswap Ave extending to the area around the Salmon Trail, but it may be more extensive than that. In any case, there are many areas at a slightly higher elevation where there is no flooding whatsoever. I don‚Äôt know where the house you are looking at is located, but I‚Äôd suggest asking the neighbours about flooding issues. Knocking on a door may seem old-fashioned, but chances are people will be happy to talk to you. 

If you search ‚ÄúLumby flooding upgrades‚Äù or similar on Google, you will find more information. 

Hope that helps!",t2_38j6lymc,burtishere,0,1629468828.0,0,t1_h9nx9ly,h9nx9ly,True,petra-ichor,t3_p852kz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vernon/comments/p852kz/looking_at_moving_to_lumby/,Looking at moving to lumby,/r/Vernon/comments/p852kz/looking_at_moving_to_lumby/h9nx9ly/,9,r/Vernon,1,9

"Lumby is a fun town. I lived there for a few years and really loved it. The locals are very nice and the shops in town are decent. The sushi was one of our favourite restaurants despite the name. (Yuki sushi) but the chinese was terrible.  It has several pizza places, a fantastic butcher and a bakery that is great too. Even the hardware store is good. 

It does flood downtown some years.  That‚Äôs mostly next to the creek. The real estate agent should have the record of if it flooded at the property you are looking at or not. 

My biggest complaint about Lumby is that It‚Äôs usually about 5 degrees colder there than Vernon. We had snow on the ground for about two months longer than Vernon.  That turned out to be kind of depressing. Also power outages, cell outages and internet outages are more frequent. 

You should check it out though. 20 mins from Vernon and the lakes and some amazing views.

"Just to play devils advocate, here's my experience with a spot fire we had on our property up in the Cariboo. We awoke one morning to find a smallish fire burning about 100 meters from our cabin. We trucked water barrels and buckets up the road and started doing what we could. 

We also dialled 555. A helicopter landed onsite within an hour with a crew of firefighters. The fire was soon out. The crew then spent about a further 6 hours there making sure everything was completely out... digging out roots and falling a few trees.

Resources at the moment are stretched beyond thin, so I can cut the forest service some slack for dropping the ball. The fact that they red-lighted those civilians who wanted to, and were prepared to put the fire out when it was small... well, that was a huge mistake, obviously.  I can empathize with these folks who stayed, and their anger - particularly the dressing down forestry gave them on Twitter.

"Tacking on for signal boost, sorry for monologue- ^ This is important. You may not be at a huge risk for the ""main"" fire, but BC Fire is worried about spot fires from flying debris- so much so that they strongly recommended the entire city be put on alert. Someone posted on Facebook yesterday and the guy found a hand sized piece of burnt wood on his deck. The possibility is there, likely or not.

Please do yourself and your household the kindness of packing an emergency bag just in case. Sometimes people don't get any warning and it's better to just be prepared. No need to go into a panic. Just make sure your gas tank is full or if you don't have transportation out of the city that you have a plan if it comes to that. If you've got pets have a plan in place for them.

Also, the link posted has some great advice for how to be prepared! It also has great advice for things you can do around your property to assist first responders in the event of a fire. If everyone did their best to do that stuff, I imagine it could make a big difference in a bad situation.

I think that while it's important not to panic and freak out, it's also important that we take it seriously. In the event of an evacuation, Vernon has a lot of people and limited exit points.
