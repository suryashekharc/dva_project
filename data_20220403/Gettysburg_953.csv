"Ok, first, you're are referring to Tommy's Pizza on Steinwehr Ave.  It's been a family business for over 50 years.   Dobbin House and Farnsworth House are both period-style restaurants and are very good.  

For starters, visit the Battlefield Visitor's Center for the overview and see the museum and painting.  You could arrange for a Licensed Battlefield Guide or perhaps with kids, a bus tour or audio tour would be good.  

I will not go into individual sites on the battlefield as the tours will cover that.  Be advised that the some of the roads to Little Round Top will be closed as they are making improvements.  

There are other things to see and do like escape rooms and other attractions.  Don't overlook other museums like the Heritage center and the Schriver House as well as Jennie Wade House.  

There are a lot of decent pub fare type of restaurants.  My favorites are Gettysburg Eddies, Garryowen Irish Pub and Blue and Gray.  Of course, Dobbin House and Farnsworth are good for the period style dining.  Across the street from Farnsworth is Mr G's Ice Cream. This is a place with very good homemade ice cream.

We were often told that drug use/abuse in Frederick county was higher than the state average, especially among 12-20 year olds.

"Wonderful questions! I did not grow up here, but I've lived here for a number of years so I can speak to a few of your questions.

I do not have children, but if I have any in the future I can see them thriving here. However I do not know specifics about the schools and programs for kids. One drawback that I can see is that it's not a very diverse area and some people can be ignorant at best or racist at worst. It's a sad reality for many small towns in America. Access to a few larger cities with more diversity and cultural learning opportunities are a day trip away, however. 

People commute to Harrisburg, but it's a long commute IMO. Commute traffic gets bad during the work week around the city, so it can be 1-1.5 hours one way if you're going into the city. I would also keep areas just outside of Harrisburg in mind as well as Frederick, MD in mind for work. Gettysburg has the county courthouse in town, so you may be able to find something here. However it's not my line of work so I don't know how plentiful law jobs are here.

Sometimes the tourism gets annoying, but you can kind of ignore all the civil war stuff if you want to. The summer traffic gets really busy, but at the same time it makes the town seem larger than it is and tourism dollars help make the town a nice place. The battlefield is large, so some areas you can avoid altogether if you want to and other areas are accessible by foot from town and can be used to exercise and be in nature. You learn quickly how to navigate town as a local, i.e. what times of year things are open or busy, what streets to avoid in peak tourist season, etc.

I am also a small town person, and I love that Gettysburg allows me to be in the middle of a very walkable town. But I know if I jump in the car and drive for 10 minutes, I can be surrounded by beautiful countryside. I enjoy walking the battlefield and seeing plants and wildlife that live there. I like that big cities are fairly close by, but I can retreat back to my small town after visiting them. I love the supportive and friendly community I've found here.

The biggest drawback for me is the lack of diversity and lack of understanding of other people who aren't conservative. The town itself is pretty balanced in political ideologies, but as soon as you leave town it's very apparent that most people are conservative.

Sometimes I get a little bored of our restaurants and activities. But there really is so much within driving distance that it doesn't bother me too often.

Hope this helps!",t2_53izwbea,ziggyjamps,0,1644153334.0,0,t1_hvt39w6,hvt39w6,True,[deleted],t3_slv3l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gettysburg/comments/slv3l4/how_is_gettysburg_for_families/,How is Gettysburg for families?,/r/Gettysburg/comments/slv3l4/how_is_gettysburg_for_families/hvt39w6/,3,r/Gettysburg,0,3
"I grew up 20 mins from Gettysburg and can say I always heard the school districts were better. My wife and I frequent the downtown; the tourism keeps more small stores/shops/restaurants open, than some of the other surrounding small towns.
The commute to Harrisburg shouldn’t be too terrible, but I can’t speak from experience as I usually am commuting south. For raising kids, the towns in this area are quiet and small, so this is a double edged sword for teens imo (not much to do for fun, might try to get into “trouble” to have fun). Overall though there is great hiking here, good history, lots of cute small family shops, and you will be a day trip away from Pittsburgh, Philly, NYC, Baltimore, and DC (football allegiances are split here)! 



Gettysburg is a great town. If you can’t find work as a lawyer in Gettysburg but like they area, you may consider driving to Chambersburg (seat of the next county over) and there may be more law work there.

If you're still in Gettysburg or haven't got here yet. Mason Dixon Distillery has awesome spirits and great food. Fore Score Brewing Company has amazing beer brewed on premises.

I'd avoid Appalachian Brewing Company their beer is average at best. Same goes for their food. Gettysburg Baking Company is a good place for lunch but you'd have to take it back to wear you're staying or just stop in and grab a chocolate chip cookie for a quick bite they are highly addictive.

You can listen to audio during the drive if you like or read. One day is possible to se everything quickly but not in depth. The other option is to pick a part of the battle you find interesting and focus on that solely.

"Downtown Gettysburg is a walkable charming area. Shops, food, bakeries. Etc. keep in mind with small town living we ‘roll up the sidewalks” and stores close earlier then large areas.
So if your looking for a bustling nightlife- this isn’t your place lol. 
Outside Gettysburg proper downtown,
Is all sourrounded by battlefield area. The areas are walkable, drivable, Bikable
And horses can be ridden. Gettysburg is small - the battlefield is the bulk of the area which is beautifully preserved. I just go to bike around. The battlefield is quiet big but easily navigate or and accessible. 

You’ll find very minimal chain stores/restaurants because it’s a National park, and the few we have are small and tucked in the skirts of Gettysburg. 
However, I do all my shopping and errands in neighboring Hanover, York,
Frederick and Baltimore. So I tend to having shopping and errand afternoons because it’s not a town you can pop over to a store. I actually prefer it that way. And I love the family owned restaurants and stores. 

Feel free to message me, as you can see I love and take pride in my town but can give you the honest truth about any question. I am an RN at a local hospital so I am also very familiar with the healthcare system

"Generally speaking, I enjoy living somewhere that generates a little excitement every year with activities, events and millions of visitors.  Granted, traffic can be a challenge at time, but you get used to it, and we all know ways of avoiding traffic.  We go to local restaurants during off season and during the week rather than weekend. 

Some people are not fond of tourists, but most recognize that tourists help bring revenue to the community (and the county). As far as living on the borough, it can be expensive. Real estate and school taxes are pretty high. The NPS, college and many other entities do not pay taxes, so the burden falls on everyone else.

"Since I am a local (30 to 45 min away) I cant speak to hotel accommodations. As far as food goes, O'Rourke's on Steinwehr is pretty good, Mr.G's Icecream at the Twin Sycamores building on Batimore Street is a must, Blue and Gray on Lincoln Square is a good spot for burgers, and Montezuma's Mexican Restaurant is on Buford Ave. Places I haven't been but have heard are good are General Pickett's (Steinwehr), The Pub Restaurant (Lincoln Square) and Garyowen's (Chambersburg Street)

Edit: I highly recommend you take at least one ghost tour while in town. Mark Nesbitt's Ghosts of Gettysburg tour is great. My guide Jen was awesome.

"Whatever you do, stay in town. The Best Western is fairly new and located on Steinwehr Ave.  The Inn of 1863 is a great location.    The Gettysburg Hotel recently reopened and is right on the square on the middle of town. 

For restaurants, it would help to know what you are interested in and how much you want to spend.  For unique experiences, I recommend Dobbin House, Farnsworth House and Mansion House In Fairfield.

Alex Hayes (managing editor for the Gettysburg Times) is notorious for downplaying the seriousness of events via headlines. He prefers to tell stories based on his own opinion kind of like the time he was on the board of directors for Survivors Inc. and decided to distance himself from all responsibilities during their bankruptcy. It was claimed the board personally did everything they could to keep the doors opened when in reality the board prevented the employees from doing their work helping victims up until the final day of operations. On Survivor Inc's final day of operations the board called the police on staff and had them removed from the premises. Employees who are trained in confidentiality were denied access to legal documents. The former shelter was locked up and utilities cut off leaving everything to molder(literally) which compromised the building and all contents including confidential documents that were left unattended. The Gettysburg Times is trash and attempts to paint a pretty picture when the truth is not so easy to talk about.,t2_drtg6,Trek716,0,1624719000.0,0,t1_h3408v5,h3408v5,True,Ryzarony23,t3_o6lrjq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gettysburg/comments/o6lrjq/graffiti_sprayed_on_highland_township_business_is/,"Graffiti sprayed on Highland Township business (is an incredibly misleading, weak headline under the ACTUAL circumstances👀🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️)",/r/Gettysburg/comments/o6lrjq/graffiti_sprayed_on_highland_township_business_is/h3408v5/,1,r/Gettysburg,0,1

"I do say whatever comes to my holy shot brain, but if you google when the word racism went mainstream, it was in 1903 according to atleast one source. What I am saying is that people like you always complain about people like me for not thinking openly about things. Like, all you focus on is the one thing. Hatred and racism. And you just help fuel racism and prejudice with people who do not think like you. You help keep the stigma alive and you fuel the fire. Think with an open mind for once about the civil war and what it was fought over and what it was like to be a citizen back then. I mean, in the 1960s marrying at 14 was normal to a 20 year old. What was normal in the 1800s? Both sides had slaves. And if you really think about it, after the war, the north just used them as paid slaves because they certainly did not get the same wages as everybody else. Look at the whole picture.

" This Crazy Ex-Girlfriend Breakup Video shows Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf's relative break into a Veteran's home, plant drugs, then call the cops.... sending her ex to jail TWICE on the came charges, thrown out or completely dropped twice.

The video shows the culmination of night 3 and day 4 of 4 days of breakup (I refused to engage her during the previous days when she didn't break in, so it's not worth watching). Crazy-Pants could not take no for an answer, claiming to exchange belongings while attempting to enter back into a relationship.

Night of day 3 she breaks into my home, kicking in my screen door, only leaving when I start to record. Any time I whip out my phone to record her- she mentions WEED as I was on probation for a first offense DUI. She kept threatening to tell my probation officer, or make a complaint if I called the cops. Her father is a long-time local attorney, and the courts and police REFUSED to cite Crazy-Pants for her crimes.

Day 4 she returns to break BACK into my house- this time to plant drugs before she calls the cops. Trooper Christopher Ashey (here-on AHSLEY) responds to throw me in jail, refusing to charge Ms. Pants with ANY infractions. I refuse to plead out, tossing the unprepared case by Assistant Dicktrick Attorney Miranda Blazek. She stomps her foot in the courtroom and vows to refile the charges.... then does.

Trooper Ashley forges a new criminal complaint, copying and pasting his old one, AGAIN, refusing to charge Crazy Pants. This time I spent 6 weeks in jail before Dicktrick Attorney Miranda Blazek drops all charges.

" POLICE CAUGHT red handed 00:00 En Route To Gettysburg Police Department to report my phone out of lockup. The sheriff’s absconded with my phone upon my arrest for trespassing in a public building. Low and behold- I run “find my iphone” and discover it in a shed out behind the local powerhouse attorney’s office whom I was investigating whence arrested.

02:15 Arrival Arriving at the police station, I inform the outdoor receptionist that I would like to talk to police about an urgent crime, ensuring not to tip off the goons. The goons take their time getting their heads together.

07:29 Contact I inform Gettysburg Police Department of the crime of the century. They find ways to explain it away acting; stalling. They refuse to jump in a cruiser and track my iPhone with me. They could go put surveillance on that shed, but that would be investigating criminal cops. Instead they send me home looking for my phone’s IMEI number on the manufacturer’s box.

15:38 SURPRISE!!! My phone winds up back in lockup… But you know what is the REAL surprise? What wasn’t confiscated from my belongings; the incriminating documents I used as visual aids for my audience to front-load the audit. These documents are copies… the originals are held on official court record down in the prothonotary.

16:20 Emergency Order THE SAME DAY AS MY ARREST- President Judge Michael George issues a new Emergency Order severely restricting access to the prothonotary. BURN NOTICE!!!

" 00:00 Background/ Stabbing

We start off with the quick run-down of WHY I’m investigating CRIMINAL Judicial Corruption in Adams County, PA. I’m an out-of-town veteran that was chased down and stabbed by a local crony AFTER disarming him of his pistol. State Police lost 2 CCTV’s of the incident, charged me with aggravated assault for fending him off with a plastic cigarette butt holder, then Prosecutors let him plead out to the equivalent of a push. As if that wasn’t enough, they denied me restitution MANDATED by law, then slipped my assailant Glenn Kessler an illegal sentence for violent offenders. Watch me bump into him in the grocery store, still armed with the .38 snub nose revolver he tried to kill me with. [https://youtu.be/-qEUAI3Fmtc](https://youtu.be/-qEUAI3Fmtc)

00:24 Systemic Corruption

The coordination of this many moving parts to conceal BLANTANTLY obvious corruption does not get this efficient without practice. Another local case HIGHLIGHTS the MAGNITUDE and plurality of the schemes involved. Another out-of-towner has been caught up in a years long divorce with a local powerhouse attorney family that has been practicing law in the county for nearly 40 years. There are so many errors in process that the appeal is going straight to supreme court. Bizarrely- the local judge is STILL hearing the case in an effort to stymie the exposure. This is WHY we’re here to attend a case today.

01:11 Private Trial

I share with ya’ll JUST THE TIP. The courts instituted a “COVID Policy” in which one must pre- register to attend a public trial (to ensure space to maintain social distancing). Fine…. I register with the courts and they attempt to have me attend a telecast. Aware of the level of modified reporting by the courts, I refuse and cite the current COVID order, allowing for public attendance barring room. The Judge CONTINUES THE TRAIL, and THAT DAY the “President” Judge issues a new COVID Policy; no public attendance. SAME. DAY. This is issued by President Judge Michael George, famous for his “GAY PANIC” murder defense, victim-shaming the surviving partner on the stand.

02:20 EVIDENCE!

Wide out in the open, right here, look at why we’re auditing these phucks. The timeline of the actions on the divorce display some MAJOR incongruencies. Judge John. D. Kuhn makes an undated filing BEFORE he is assigned the case, BEFORE Judge Christina Simpson inexplicably recuses herself after making MONTHS worth of rulings in the case. A further examination upon the dates; times stamped by the Prothonotary on the actual documents don’t line up with the times filed. This is SEVERAL MAJOR discrepancies on the official record displaying judicial conspiracy. Believe-me-you; the is MUCH more… and it’s why we’re here to investigate.

06:08 CHARGE!!!

Watch ‘em as they take the bait. The goons didn’t know what documents I just exposed. They’re waiting at the door to deny me access to cover the trial under the 1st Amendment. FIRE!!!! PANIC!!!

"How I sued the Government Pt. 3 | Pre-trial Motions

In this episode we finally get to the 00:00 Hor'derve of Turds served up by the state trying the keep this one quashed away. The big reveal? We’re NOT suing for civil rights violations from the police retaliation filmed on the channel.

0:37 Surprise! RICO; Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act We have the State Police and County District Attorney in Racketeering. RICO! Short for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961–1968. This channel shows where Pennsylvania State Police Christopher Ashey and District Attorney Miranda Blazek REPEATEDLY selectively remit evidence and prejudicially file charges, taking/ withholding action as an official, thereby committing an act of extortion.

3:30 Defense Motions to Dismiss Our District Attorney Miranda Blazek lawyers up and responds with a motion to dismiss the case based on the fact that my claims aren’t relievable because nobody violated a law, because they’re entitled to qualified and prosecutorial immunity, therefore, nobody violated a law….. it’s a vicious a-hole lawyer loop.

4:35 Opposition to Defense Motion I respond in opposition, citing with exhibits, showing the defendant DID violate RICO Defendants DID violate RICO, 18 U.S.C.A. Section 1961- Committing an Act Involving threat of extortion AND Section 1962- Setting a pattern by refusing to remit selective evidence, THEREBY exempting them from qualified immunity for knowingly breaking the law Malley v. Briggs.

6:20 PLOT TWIST! DEFAULT JUDGEMENT! Seemingly out of nowhere; Pennsylvania Deputy Attorney General Jonathan Blake contacts us as counsel on behalf of Trooper Christopher Ashley. It appears Deputy Attorney General Jonathan Blake only e-filed his documents…. Failing to note that I’m Plaintiff Pro Se’; I’m not an attorney and not registered for e-file. This has opened up the State Popo for default judgement, and I make my own motion to award $30 Million dollars! Hahah, it’ll never happen, but it made a good burn… and begs to wonder how many other documents haven’t been mailed….

8:20 PLOT TWIST- Rope-a-Dope The last PLOT TWIST- We learn how to properly attach exhibits of criminal judicial activity… which via PA Code 204 Rule 8.3 Reporting Professional Misconduct, LEGALLY MANDATES the misconduct reported by any lawyer that has these documents come across their desks….

9:32 Roping the Biggest Dope Joke CUE ATTORNEY GENERAL JOSH SHAPIRO. We got the big, one, ya’ll!!!! He signed off on the last motion, so we sent these incriminating documents across his desk.

"It's embarrassing to call it a hearing. I watched and was waiting for supposed evidence. It was people telling stories that sounded more like they didn't understand or know the procedure. They weren't under oath, they weren't questioned under any sort of official hearing. 

The challenger in Philly who said he was denied entry failed to mentioned the poll worker who denied entry later apologized and let him in stating he wasn't aware the rule had changed stated your district must be on your certificate. 

I say this as someone who agrees elections need to be fair and free and if there is corruption or irregularities they should be addressed. This ""hearing"" didn't do it. Elections have alot of moving parts and they aren't perfect.

"This out of town veteran gets ejected from a Veterans Day Event for asking for help- from the establishment that hid my stabbing by a local crony.

0:00 The Video starts off with me informing the viewer of my situation and displaying the ""cheat sheet"" visual aid I made displaying the law breaking and my attempted murder. At this event I catch:

05:42 Adams County VA Rep Stan Clark- Refusing to engage me because I ""secretly"" video taped him cursing me out and stalling my case on purpose- [https://youtu.be/HEwXcfqM\_Bc](https://youtu.be/HEwXcfqM_Bc) It sounds bizarre- but it's because he was hired by his goon/good buddy,

07:36 County Commissioner Randy Phiel, criminally complicit in covering up my stabbing. He is IN CHARGE of the common courts, and I have evidence informing them of the impending illegal sentence BEFORE the judgement went through... on our election day. Here he is setting up a targeted stop on Gettysburg's Battlefield by the Chief Ranger, as Phiel is a retired one. [https://youtu.be/AZNhv6N3DpU](https://youtu.be/AZNhv6N3DpU) VA Rep Stan Clark can lean back in his work chair at the commissioner's office and say, 'Hey Randy? Why did you let one of my vets get stabbed? Why did you let his assailant go on an illegal sentence, wiping it from his record? Do you know the guy is still armed, and regularly bumps into our vet?""

08:57 Sheriff James Muller - Viet Nam Vet and ""defender of the constitution"" [http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/05/11/former-marine-pa-sheriff-vows-to-defend-constitution-not-governors-unconstitutional-oders/](http://www.shorenewsnetwork.com/2020/05/11/former-marine-pa-sheriff-vows-to-defend-constitution-not-governors-unconstitutional-oders/) Every law enforcement officer in the County received a detailed email of my situation [https://youtu.be/U6bznw7JNf4](https://youtu.be/U6bznw7JNf4). None of them responded, unless it was to harass me [https://youtu.be/10EQEEtdmcY](https://youtu.be/10EQEEtdmcY). Sheriff Muller refuses to charge for crimes in his jurisdiction.

18:02 State Representative Dan Moul- ""Upset"" that I ""secretly"" video recorded him before saying he would ask the District Attorney about passing an illegal sentence- [https://youtu.be/OfBuAyML\_ek](https://youtu.be/OfBuAyML_ek) Since then I've had to bump into the guy twice- still armed with the .38 I disarmed him of.- [https://youtu.be/-qEUAI3Fmtc](https://youtu.be/-qEUAI3Fmtc) 21:25 Gettysburg Police SGT Harald Pruy, refusing to charge crimes in his jurisdiction. Even State representative Torren Ecker makes a less than joyful appearance, perturbed at being recognized and named. His office, along with every member of the Pennsylvania Legislative branch received a detailed email about my hidden 3x attempted murder. This is the state protecting their rotten criminal police over the safety of you and your family. Glenn Kessler, my assailant, is a repeat violent firearms offender, receiving illegal sentences, not being charged for stabbings and attempted murders. This is real ya'll. This dude has a license to kill, and he's still wandering public with the same snub nose .38 he tried to kill me with.

26:40 Senator Doug Mastriano tactically stayed hidden until they threw me out, a tactic he developed in-the-rear-with-the-gear as a Military Intelligence Officer. Notice in the video that the ceremony is about to start and I am quiet lined up along the building filming, not engaging anyone... then get kicked out. It wasn't because I was bothering anybody, is was because this douche bag was about to come out and speak.

"I'm going to hop in here because I've seen you post in here a few times. 

I don't know the truth of any of these claims, and I don't really know any of the people involved, having just moved into the area recently. That being said, I don't think that your videos do a good job of being convincing. You cut the video of your ex at relatively opportune times (you could, for instance, put up the entirety of your recordings as a second video just as proof that you aren't taking things out of context). You also, in most of your videos paint yourself as a victim. Maybe you are a victim, that's absolutely possible. But as a viewer, when I see post after post after post of you being a victim of something, it doesn't convince me that you're being targeted as much as it does that you might have a victim-hood complex. 

I think you could do a much better job of communicating your message if you backed off from the personal side of this. Obviously, this is all personal to you, as it's happening to you, but as an outside observer, I want things to be as objective as possible.

"I just spent the weekend there, so I have some good suggestions.

I'm assuming you want to at least tour the battlefield, right? There are a few ways to do it that we didn't do (bus tour or personally hired field guide). We downloaded an app (Action Tour Guide Gettysburg) for about $6. It starts at the visitor's center and guides you through everything. As you drive, it pinpoints your location and tells you about what you're passing. If you don't get out, it should take about an hour, but you'll want to stop at a few places like the Pennsylvania monuments, Little Round Top, Devil's Den, and the soldier's cemetery at the end. Overall, it took us about three hours to drive and stop at a few key locations. The visitor's center has some attractions that you can pay to do as well (I think it's a movie and a museum).

As far as ghost tours, we toured the Jennie Wade House (only civilian to be killed in the Battle - be sure to ask the guide where she's buried), visited Sach's Covered Bridge (the site where three Confederate soldiers were executed) in the day time and night time and Devil's Den (where snipers hid to pick off soldiers). We did the Museum of Haunted Objects, which is the birthplace of Jennie Wade. This was honestly a little hokey and the tour guide was a little weird, but if you don't go in with high expectations, you should have fun. We also did a walking candlelight tour with Gettysburg Ghost Tours that took us around the Jennie Wade House, the Orphanage and around cemeteries. This was fun. We learned some history and heard some ghost stories. There are a few other companies that offer ghost tours, so you're bound to find something you like. I hear the Orphanage Tour is pretty good, as well as the Farnsworth House tour.

FOOD.

Blue and Gray Bar and Grill, which has unique burgers named after Union/Confederate generals. If you're adventurous (we were not), they have a Picket's Charge Challenge where there's a massive burger for $25. If you finish it, you get your meal for free and a few other prizes.

Dobbin House. It's the oldest building in Gettysburg with some killer French Onion soup. It's got a natural spring running through the basement and a room connected to the Underground Railroad. They weren't giving tours when we were there, but you might get lucky. It's supposed to be haunted as well.

Four Score Bear Co. had delicious pub food and amazing beers, including sour beer slushies. If you like breweries, you should check this one out. There are a couple of breweries that we wanted to hit up but didn't have time. I hear Battlefield Brew Works is good. In fact, me and my wife are coming back at some point before the end of the year to try it out.

Savor Gettysburg Food Tour. This might have been my favorite thing that we did. The tickets are a little pricy if you're on a budget, but for $60 a ticket you get to sample food from six locations and have a guided tour of historic downtown Gettysburg. Personally, I think the value was great. We had pizza at Food 101, Shephard's pie and a hard cider sample at Gary Owen Irish Pub, Tai food at Tai Elephant Walk, bruschetta and ravioli at Swope Manor, several samples of cider and wine at Reid Winery and Cider House, and ice cream at Mr. G Ice Cream. Along the way, our tour guide told us all about the history of the buildings we passed, all about President Lincoln coming to town, and showed off where artillery shells are still stuck in some of the buildings. Even if you don't do the food tour, Food 101 is a nice place for a quick lunch and Mr. G's ice cream is a definite stop to see the bullet holes in the brick and the witness trees.

Gettysburg Museum of History is free. It's tiny, but there are hundreds of memorabilia from different wars and events. Weird stuff too. Lincoln's hair, JFK and Hitler's blood, Marilyn Monroe's bra.

Mister Ed’s Elephant Museum and Candy Emporium. It's about 12 miles outside Gettysburg. It's another one of those unique places that you have to see to believe. Hundreds of elephant statues and knickknacks and yummy candy.

We wanted to do the Shriver House Museum on our last day, but it was closed by the time we got there. It's all about the civilian experience.

Downtown Shopping. There's plenty of cute shops you can pick up souvenirs at. Check out Nerd Herd, a gamer store. We didn't know this until it was too late, but there's a game that starts at Nerd Herd where you visit certain locations around town and you can pick up a playing card at each location and collect them all.

There's a lot more to do. There's escape rooms themed after the Civil War, President Eisenhower National Historic Site, Seminary Ridge Museum and Historic Center. You can do a lot in three days.

Good luck!",t2_8yf1g,thejealousone,0,1598043995.0,0,t1_g2d829g,g2d829g,True,TMushinski,t3_ie2qgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gettysburg/comments/ie2qgf/recommendations/,Recommendations,/r/Gettysburg/comments/ie2qgf/recommendations/g2d829g/,5,r/Gettysburg,0,5
"Farnsworth House seems like the place to go for ghost tours. They also have a cool outdoor bar. 

The Inn at Herr's Ridge or 1863 Restaurant are great spots for fine dining. 

A hidden gem because it's fairly new is Mela Kitchen at Jack's Hard Cider behind the Gettysburg outlets. They turned a movie theater into a cider house and their menu is very ""foodie"" but it's also delicious. Great pressed-in-house ciders and some local beers as well. A bit pricey though. 
Also, Fourscore Beer Co might not be a hidden gem anymore but they're very good too. 

Blue & Grey Bar & Grill is an icon because of they're delicious and unique burgers. La Bella Italia's has amazing pizza (closed on Mondays). Upper Crust has good personal, brick oven pizzas and a cool free arcade. Mr. G's is the best ice cream. 

As far as adventurous, that's what the park is designed for. Devil's Den and Little and Big Roundtop are great places to be able to climb around and get some views. There's a lookout tower near the Eternal Light that gives a great view of the town and battlefield.",t2_17f20h,t21millz,0,1598043756.0,0,t1_g2d7lcs,g2d7lcs,True,TMushinski,t3_ie2qgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gettysburg/comments/ie2qgf/recommendations/,Recommendations,/r/Gettysburg/comments/ie2qgf/recommendations/g2d7lcs/,3,r/Gettysburg,0,3

"I've lived in the outskirts (western side) of Gettysburg for 8 months & it's pretty nice! I wouldn't choose to live right in the city due to traffic & tourist crowds. We occasionally get traffic out our way if its a busy weekend & people try to cut through to the city, usually bikers. But people are generally nice & decent. Not a lot of serious crime. I don't feel like I need to be paranoid about locking my door or leaving something outside.
There may not be a ton of job options right in Gettysburg for manufacturing but check out Hanover PA for those type of jobs. That's where the Utz & Snyders factories are located & it's maybe 20-30 min commute. Drawbacks are it can be kind of a pain getting around on holidays or busy event weekends. Parking in town can be annoying on weekends too & parking fees seem higher than other places I've seen. But otherwise not a bad place to be!

"Gettysburg is a great place to live! Town or outskirts is totally personal preference, I like being in town because you can walk pretty much everywhere but some obviously like to have a little more space between them and their neighbors. Taxes in the borough are also pretty high, if you're buying a place though you'll be able to compare taxes at specific properties. Crime and drugs really aren't anything to worry about in Gettysburg, there's obviously a little of that anywhere you go but it's so minor in Gettysburg and it's not centralized to a particular location or anything. People say to avoid Breckenridge St. but it's really not dangerous, kids walk down there on the way to middle school every morning and afternoon. I'm not in the manufacturing industry but I always see jobs posted, a lot more in Hanover then in Gettysburg, though, but it's a quick commute!

Another fun thing to do is (depending on if you have children that might be to young) is watch the movie Gettysburg. Make sure to come prepared, be smart on what clothes to bring, make sure to pack sun screen, and grab some snacks for when you get hungry.

"Gettysburg Battlefield is a National Military Park, as opposed to a National Park.  National Parks often do have the type of camping you're talking about, but Military Parks don't.   
 I guess the best way to explain it is that Gettysburg Battlefield is one large cemetery.   
 Basically what it means is that access to the battlefield is restricted to daytime hours.  Absolutely no one is supposed to be within the battlefield once the Rangers close the gates at dusk.  

This doesn't mean you're out of luck, though!  Approximately 20 minutes west of Gettysburg there is a State Forest called Michaux.  There are over twenty primitive camp sites within the forest, and they are free.  The only thing that you need to do is get ahold of the Forest Service for a permit, and a Ranger will post it at your site so no one sets up there before you arrive.  If you're only staying for one night, you do not need a permit, you just need to make sure that the site does not have a current permit posted for someone else.  Always follow Leave no Trace principals.

ALSO- The Appalachian Trail runs north and south through Michaux State Forest.  There are a few PATC shelters within this area, and there are also plenty of off-trail sites to call home for a night.

Maybe check the National Park web site for dates. As of right now the buildings are all closed up, but you can do driving & self guided walking tours. Public campgrounds are still closed but private ones have opened. Hope you can still make your trip!

"I'll try my best to answer your questions as numbered.

1 crime is on the rise but not a huge problem yet.
2 PA taxes are a funky thing. We have real estate taxes. School taxes. Occupational taxes. Per capita taxes. State tax. I'm sure I'm missing something but, you get the idea. We are experiencing growth which is driving those up but we are still less than our neighbors to the north and east.
3 registration will depend on vehicle class. Car, truck, etc.
4 we have the highest gas taxes in the country. That being said, CA gas prices are ridiculous.
5 snow can vary from meh to holy shit. Worry about the ice more. If you will be retired, just stay home.
6 hot and humid generally starts in the Middle of June and runs through the end of August.
7 severe weather is usually limited to snow and ice storms in the winter and thunderstorms in the summer. Don't buy in flood plains.
8 there are 3 grocery stores in town. Anything else go to Hanover or Chambersburg.
9 homelessness is not a huge issue here. They keep the area pretty well cleaned up to keep the tourists happy.
10 there are a lot of seasonal activities here. Again, it's a tourist town so they try to have things to keep people coming.
