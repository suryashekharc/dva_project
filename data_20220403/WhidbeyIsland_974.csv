"I agree a bridge would be the ultimate solution for those concerned with commuting and overall access. IMO, put a toll on it and divert the shut down ferry funds to it when it's built for a period of time. There's no way the current ferry system isn't bleeding cash. I imagine it's be a wash in a relatively short period of time. 

There would be a sizeable chunk of the community that would prefer to stay ""isolated"" from the mainland. If we got a bridge, the island would be on an immediate growth trajectory and infrastructure would definitely need  massive capital investment to boot.

As for the except the Evergreen bridge comparison. That's not totally 1:1, as the evergreen is across a lake that is relatively calm and the crossing from Clinton to Mukilteo can have same huge swells.

"It will definitely be a money-loser without state support. You need 4 crew, at least - maybe as many as 6. 4 is around $400/ hour. That's an optimistic minimum for benefits and extra staff to cover a full week. Add that to $100/ hour for fuel, and at almost 2 hours per round trip a crew would have a full day with just 4 round trips.  

SO your simple operating costs would be $4,000/ day. Even at $20/ passenger, one way, you'd need to have 200 passenger trips per day just to break even. Actual expenses would be much greater that this, because of docking fees, permits, advertising, and many other incidental costs.  

Add in the delays for marine life and allowance for dock time and you are down to 3 runs/ day, at that same cost. That said, I'm for this, but I think a fast passenger ferry that included Mukilteo would be better utilized.

I’ve been in the Navy a while, +20 years and was dual military for 6 years and now she is employed in the civilian medical field.

My problem isn’t necessarily that the school is giving them breakfast, it’s the fact that tax payers are paying for it.  People are paying for what other parents should  be providing. Maybe we need to levy a tax for school shoes. Those are important, can’t spend an 8 hr day at school without decent shoes. Or we could make a levy for glasses. Can’t learn if you can’t see. Ummmm no, again it’s the parents responsibility. And to say breakfast has to be free because parents can’t pay for it is untrue for 99%.

"I dont want to send you too far down a rabbit hole here or  scare you, but ""wet dog smell"" can actually be mold and I would absolutely look further into this, as even a ""super deep clean"" is not a fix. 

My first inclination is to check and change the HVAC air filter and get the furnace and HVAC lines professionally cleaned. Of course this assumes the home is forced air.

Second- yes, professional carpet cleaning. Don't just get a low ball cheap cleaner. Get someone that cares and wants you to be healthy. Pull up a corner of the carpet somewhere and spot check the carpet pad and sub floor. 

Third- check the crawl space for signs standing water and/or overall dampness. If it's always wet, it's safe to assume the first floor sub floor insulation moldy. Though, your home inspection should have seen this..

In fact, a decent home inspection should have noted any of the above.

"Partially because previous councils didn't raise rates to maintain the system, so the city has been playing catchup for the last 10+ years.  Additionally, unlike many other areas, Langley includes about 3500/gal/mo in the base rate, to actually encourage use, as lack of use cause build-up in the system, which then needs to be flushed.  Additionally for both water and sewer there are not enough users to spread out the base costs, so everyone has to pay higher fees to cover the base costs for the equipment and personnel.

Hopefully, once the LIP is completed and more people start connecting to the sewer system, and there is the opportunity to build more homes in east Langley, we can begin to discuss lowering or freezing the base rates.",t2_5qnj8,TEG24601,0,1638723373.0,0,t1_hncayoj,hncayoj,False,MithrandirBicycle,t3_r8u5xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whidbey/comments/r8u5xn/proposed_development_in_langley_draws_concern/,Proposed development in Langley draws concern,/r/Whidbey/comments/r8u5xn/proposed_development_in_langley_draws_concern/hncayoj/,1,r/Whidbey,0,1

"Think about where they get their water. The island has limited ground water that is at risk in some areas of salt water intrusion. The north end has to pipe in water from Anacortes, who gets their water in turn from the Skagit, which is susceptible to low flow, flooding, and other uses (farm irrigation, minimum level requirements to keep river conditions optimal for salmon spawning). 

The City must treat all of the waste water. I don’t know what Langley’s capacity is, but up here in Oak Harbor, my water bill is 250$ minimum for a two bedroom with two people who minimize their water use. The cost is likely because of the new water treatment plant. 

As a side note, I’m an Environmental Science student, studying land use planning at the moment  so it is very interesting to me to see this kind of story pop up on Reddit. Many of the concerns are valid given the state of the housing market, the number of livable wage jobs, and availability of affordable housing.

"We have some rather ""Interesting"" things going on here on the rock, & a few unmentionable things going on UNDERNEATH Whidbey.....\~See: ""D.U.M.B's"" No, Im not joking unfortunately...

\-Funny, a buddy of mine said his current employer was in the exact same area & heard the SAME THINGS as you had while working outdoors a few summers back! Sure, it couldve be some hippies in the woods/on the bluff, but your experience isnt singular @ all & bears hallmarks of the ""Other Than"" category....

By chance did you or your partner experience any tones &/or ""Ear Ringing"" directly before, or after the events/weekend?..\~If so, its indicative of specific frequency-based technological applications & uses. No, its not ""Tinnitus""...;)

Theres some pretty exotic technology being used on members of the populace out here. MANY people have been purposefully targeted &/or simply R-U-N-O-F-T the rock if one runs afoul of the local cult ...

Research: ""V2K-Voice To Skull"" technology-(""Radio Frequency Hearing Effect: USPatent#6470214B1)- <This is just one example of MANY such devices, the first being granted by the patent office in 1974 as the ""Frey Microwave Hearing Effect"" using pulsed microwaves & a directional antenna, which in effect transmits sounds/words/anything audible to an individual, via a 1-way telepathic effect.  Only YOU or anyone inside the antenna ""Beam"" can hear it, but INSIDE your head.  Similar to current commercially available ""AudioSpotlight""-(although A.S uses infra-sound as the carrier)-The ""Frey Effect"" was discovered in the late 1940's by radar technicians wrenching on radar dish installations, hearing ""Clicks & pops"" inside their heads while standing in front of the dish array while it was transmitting...

Many such brain bending patents can be found @ ""[ohchr.org](https://ohchr.org)""<my link is prob bad. Any search for: DEW's-Directed Energy Weapons &/or ""Targeted Individuals"" will do, PLEASE dont immediately judge peoples experiences as ""Mental Conditions"", as such is VERY dismissive to people suffering from such abominations, people who are already purposefully marginalized as it is. -Much of this tech MIMICS mental instability, which is GREAT as it immediately dis-credits folks being hit with such...

People experiencing such auditory effects can perceive it as being ""Outside"" -in ones general environment, or being able to audibly pin-point the sound in one or more locations w/o any person there to emit or vocalize those very sounds-OR- it can be INSIDE ones head, as if listening to headphones. Its pretty WILD stuff, Ive had experience with it in a military capacity. It is also HIGHLY classified & incredibly DESTRUCTIVE to individuals, specifically if they havent a clue about the existence & applications of such tech....

The tech & processes employed would even make the most astute stone-cold techie scratch their heads with wonder & dis-belief-(Frequency based electronic warfare, which the local Navy base specializes in;)- Its WAY more than simple R & D/T & E. Its intentional, destructive & highly unconstitutional....

Ive been HEAVILY targeted out here myself, & know a few others that have suffered same. A PATTERN of activity has certainly reared its ugly head on Whidbey. Only problem for the local cult, is that Ive STAYED PUT throughout the ordeal-(IE: ""Hug"" your enemy tactic;)-. Its been a dangerous game, but by staying put, Ive gotten to KNOW some of these people within the community through the early organized harassment/gangstalking phase during 2012....

Theyve exposed themselves by their very Psy-Op tactics. This island IS NOT what it seems upon surface-level experience & casual inspection....

\-This is NOT a loosely organized, underfunded group of people, many have F.B.I InfraGard creds. Its SPOOK CITY out here due to all the military installations & defense contractors both here on the island & nearby....

"A couple decades ago, they held a ""Barnyard Scramble"" at the fair every year. They'd release baby pigs, chickens, lambs, and bunnies - I don't think they released calves, but I'm not sure. Anyway, they release these small animals in the arena, then they released the children, to go catch the animals.  

It was tremendously entertaining. Chickens can fight back, pigs are smart and slippery, lambs are just cute, but bunnies....  

Bunnies spend their entire lives looking out for, and escaping predators, and these kids were predators, yes, but nowhere near as skilled as the bunnies. Bunnies could, and did, escape. Every year for the many years this went on.  

Some bunnies leapt out of the arena to escape, others leapt away from the kids on their way to the car, and others were simply released somewhere near or on the way home.  

Langley is now overrun with the result of these escapes. There are fancy bunnies everywhere. The local predators couldn't eat enough to keep ahead of the bunny invasion, and bunny food (grass) is everywhere.

"The South End is a huge landmass, so your options will vary greatly.

Scatchet Head and Sandy Hook have the best chance, as most of the transmitters are in Seattle or Bremerton, so you'll be able to get KOMO, KING/KONG, KCPQ/KZJO, KIRO, and KCTS, as well as perhaps KFFV/KVOS.  Around Langley, you will need a much stronger antenna, and you may be able to get the retransmitted for KIRO and KZJO/KCPQ, along with some Canadian Channels.  But for the most part, due to geography, the lack of re-transmitters, and trees, antennas are not really reliable.

"Indeed. My indoor propane range has a marvelous duct hood with an electric fan to exhaust all the combustion fumes along with cooking odors. It's indoor certification depends on that forced draft ventilation being installed with the range. I could easily and safely run a camping propane stove atop that range, using the duct hood to properly ventilate the combustion fumes.

And during a power outage, without a generator to supply electicity, neither the propane camping stove nor that propane range are usable - either will set off the CO detector within a minute of ignition. I *could* open all the outside doors to probably clear enough ventilation, but that's not feasible during a winter outage. A propane Coleman lantern will eventually get the CO detector to chirp intermittently, if I set it right underneath for a while, so maybe *some* high-efficiency propane small appliances aren't as dangerous, but a propane cooking stove sure is.

Conversely, the little butane burner has never set off the CO detector, running on the kitchen counter while the house is closed up during a winter storm.

You're completely filled with hate for someone you've never met; I am sure you are a wonderful person to be around.

Also, ""uneducated"" = ""unindoctrinated"" for many things. Because I don't care for other men to think for me, that's fine.

One issue to take note of is that there are just parts of the Island that don't have towers (Sandy Hook, Libby Rd.), and that is unlikely going to change, and because of the trees and geography, you aren't going to get much of any coverage from off-island towers.  On top of that, as the carriers sunset their 3G towers, they are not using said towers for LTE or 5G coverage, they are just turning them off.

"Your best investment if you have to/want to go out is a set of winter tires.  I have a second set of rims one size smaller for winter.  205/45R17 summer, 195/55R16 on Blizzaks for winter.  

Winter tires are not just for snow, they also do better in the wet to get water out to help against hydroplaning.  They also have better grip when it gets cold.  'All Seasons' are really three seasons and start to get hard around 45-40.  Winter rubber keeps its grip, the downside is, you have to store another set of rims/tires the rest of the year and have them changed if you're not handy.

Roads get sanded and traveled, and as others have said, not a ton of snowfall, but can happen.  They're not a harrowing over the pass kind of trip either.  Watch your speed, add following distance, mind the deer.

"When it snows around here it's usually quite an event and the region slows down as a whole because of it. People are either late to work once the roads clear or the business is shut down. Seems to happen about once a year lately with a ""big ""event. Otherwise, you pretty much just need to be careful with ice when it dips into the 20's (sometimes less) at night. We also get quite a bit of freezing fog causing black ice when it's cold at night in the winter. Usually not a problem as long as you are not the absolute first on the roads in the AM. Traffic melts it away and the County does a decent job with maintaining 525 with salt or more typically the salt solution they spray at night to prevent solid freezing. 

I still keep show tires on in the winter, but I also head across the cascades for trips in the winter and have learned to appreciate winter tires in slick conditions. Also, an AWD Subaru...yeah, I'm officially an islander lol. 

I spent a few years in Colorado and they always laughed at Seattle getting like an inch or two of snow and shutting down, but let me tell you, what they didn't understand is that the PNW has....hills.

"I live in Oak Harbor but work from home.  Life is pretty chill. The COVID here is pretty stable.  Housing isn’t only high, it’s extraordinarily tight.  There are dozens of offers on every listing and a good percentage are cash with a waiver on inspections.  Housing is more available in Skagit County, but it does tend to run higher (especially in Burlington/Mt. Vernon)  Sedro-Woolley is affordable, but it’s out there.  Get started ASAP-as in contact a local realtor ASAP-even if renting.

Life is much like a by-gone era, here.  The sidewalks roll up at 5:00pm in Oak Harbor and people will pay more (at least a lot of the permanent residents-many who are retired Navy) at a local shop than at a chain.  The Dutch heritage, while not as influential as it once was, is palpable. Traffic, when you know how to avoid highway 20 in Oak Harbor, js easy.

"I'd say it's definitely WAY less expensive to live off the island. Unless you own your house, you pay an arm and a leg to live there. The ferry sucks and everything is more expensive on the island. It's beautiful, yes, but very expensive. 

Visiting Fort Casey is a lot of fun, especially on warmer days when you can take a kite (and fly it), and explore the fort itself. 

COVID is about to shut everything down over here again. We're required to wear masks in public again, and we're just waiting for the governor to shut the state down. He's been hinting at it.

"Market is crazy everywhere in WA, not just Whidbey. Always has been a really expensive place to live as far back as I can remember. Right now Whidbey has very low housing inventory and that includes rentals. The island just doesn't have the infrastructure in place for high density construction. Living on island is great but I always say it's not for everyone. If you have any requirement for always popping out for dinner and entertainment, probably best to commute in from Mt Vernon or the I5 corridor. If you are a low-key, outdoors type then you'll really enjoy it here. Personally, I moved here to get away from it all. Lots of beach time and lots of hikes around the island.

As for covid- the south end in particular has a high vaccination rate and people are  (were) really good with masks. This whole side of the state is...well, zero comparison to Florida. Lol. We also have had fairy low cases compared to the rest of the state and country. Everything has been open and people followed the mask mandate when it was in place. Now that it's lifted and you don't need to wear a mask if you are vaccinated, there's a lot less masks and social distancing in general -as expected. Still quite a few masking up even with a vaccine.",t2_tmumh,kayak83,0,1629000654.0,0,t1_h8zsgmy,h8zsgmy,True,Tvchick2297,t3_p4kqv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Whidbey/comments/p4kqv7/where_to_livd/,Where to livd,/r/Whidbey/comments/p4kqv7/where_to_livd/h8zsgmy/,9,r/Whidbey,0,9

"Hi!! I love living on the island, though I live on the southern end. If you are military I imagine you will be in Oak Harbor. Oak Harbor has all your typical shopping options - larger box stores like Walmart and smaller shops. It is connected to the mainland via bridge so no tolls getting off the island. Plenty of food options. There is tons of hiking on the island and the schools aren't bad (much better than where I moved from). My favorite hikes are probably at Deception Pass State Park - but I love most of the hikes. We spend a lot of time at dog parks (south side has an off leash park on the beach). If you want to live away from the city side you can go a little south to Coupeville. Super cute town with a neat downtown and a hospital (I have heard complaints but I broke my ankle a few months ago and I was in and out in an hour with a boot and crutches..I was happy with it). Not sure about housing there - it'll be rough. I love the south end - I shop in Langley frequently and hike South Whidbey State Park. It's a lot more rural down here. 

Living on the island costs more than off island - food is more expensive. Well everything is really. I can never get repair folks or handymen to call back....they are always backed up. And it seems like everything closes super early. Getting off the island can be a pain when you live on the southside - you have to plan ahead and are at the mercy of the ferry lines. 

But seriously - I love it here. Oh! There is a drive in theatre just south of Oak Harbor - it is super fun with an arcade and such.

"There are dead spots all over the island. I've used Verizon for many years, and it's not terrible. You learn where the calls are going to drop. Cedar vista approaching Kens Korner on 525. Several spots through Greenbank. Maxwellton near the High School. West Beach road south of West Beach on the north end.  

We're lucky to have any service at all, frankly. For being as close to a metropolitan area of 4 million people, we're as rural as parts of the Rocky Mountains. No chain stores, cows, logging, tourism, artists and artisans, retired folk. Don't be too strident demanding modern utilities - they come with a terrible price.

"So I've been trying to get a bit of a Whidbey Discord community going. Not a lot of interaction and I can't speak for the age range at all. I know we have some older and some younger people.

Mapping systems do not reliably understand vehicle ferries.  
Once the backup is past Dalton on the Island or the School in Mukilteo, it is faster to drive around.  
Some people cannot sit in the line, especially in the heat.  I know my Crohn's hates the heat, and without facilities along the line, it is safer for me to drive around in A/C than to risk an accident.  
Same goes for little kids.  If you can't run the AC, or there isn't a decent breeze, and you have direct sunlight, driving around is safer.

Furthermore, being asked whether I want to give gratuity, while prepaying, prior to service for takeout, is also causing money to be left on the table.

Staffing is still an ongoing issue, occasionally a vessel is delayed until a late crewman (or their replacement) arrives, which can affect the sailing schedule & waiting lines for a few hours. Or, when a vessel on a ""more critical"" route goes down for mechanical issues, one of the two vessels from the Clinton-Muk route usually gets reassigned to cover.

NB: Last weekend one of the jumbo vessels had a fire, and the whole system has been shuffled around until it's repaired (ETA late summer). Which means one of the Muk-Cli vessels is smaller (124 cars vs 144 cars) than the regular one.

"Weekdays at that time shouldn't be bad. Ferries are on the half hour, usually, so if you show up at 7:30, you might end up on the 7:35. Once you get into the holding area, you're going when they tell you to. 

Also, I'm assuming your family would be coming in a separate car- there's no long term parking for them to park at. 

Living here, the only times that I avoid are:
Leaving to Whidbey Saturdays any time from 10-5pm (in the summer)
Leaving Whidbey to the mainland 10-5pm on Sundays
Weekdays going to Whidbey 3pm-5pm

The Washington State Ferries twitter is really helpful, they will let you know if there's delays going over. Also, the app NW Ferry will give you the same updates, and give you an easy view of the schedule, and provides camera views so you can wait in line.

"The walk-in urgent care clinic in Oak Harbor (and the one in Anacortes) closes at 7pm on weekdays, so there's really no island option aside from the ER at WhidbeyGen or Island Hospital. I thought even the urgent-care clinics on the mainland also closed at 7pm or 8pm - if so, you're still looking at an ER visit for after-hours care, with the lengthy wait times & potential out-of-pocket expense that brings.

Frankly, I just rely on a Boy Scout first aid manual and a large camping-type first aid box for minor injuries, same as when I was a kid growing up in the rural boonies. Bactine, hibiclens, bacitracin, various tape rolls, 4x4 gauze, assorted bandaids, superglue, butterfly closures for abrasions, cuts & lacerations.

After the second time, they demanded an explanation as to ""why are you wasting our time!?"" I explained what they'd done in the past, and that I wanted to be sure that it didn't happen again because their department was either incompetent or maybe, just maybe, getting kickbacks from a collection agency.

"You made the right choice.  

If you need emergency care, call an ambulance. They will either fix you up, take you over town (at your preference - refuse to go to Coupeville!), or call a helicopter from Coupeville to take you to Harborview.  

Whidbey General isn't a bad hospital, as such - parts of it are fine - but they just don't have/ can't keep decent doctors for enough coverage. Hell, Oak Harbor doesn't really have any decent doctors either.  

I go over town for everything. I went to the Coupeville ER once, for a broken ankle, and they didn't do much. They did manage to bill me personally $1,700 - even though I had 100% ER coverage from great healthcare coverage. The billing department never figured out how to bill my insurance - or couldn't be arsed to do so - and sent my bills off to someone else with a similar name. The first I heard of the charges was when a collection agency tracked me down. Considering I gave them photocopies of my license, insurance card, and filled out their forms with all the info, it was a spectacularly incompetent effort of Whidbey General's part.  

The problems with staffing are not just limited to physicians. This is a rural hospital that is run by management contracts and nepotism. It's not good.

"I shop in 4 different stores, for different things. Food Mart in Clinton has some competitive pricing on some things, good sales, and a few things I can't find in other places. Red Apple in Clinton is good for non-perishables, but their produce can be sketchy. Frozen selection is good, and they have liquor. The Goose has bulk foods, a good, but spendy produce selection, good meat and seafood, and a variety of items not found at other places - or found in larger sizes at the Goose. Their reward system is good. Prairie Market in Coupeville has great produce, good meat, and good specials, but otherwise is just fair. Don't get their paper bags - they suck.  

I only shop at Payless in Freeland if I have to, same with the Star Store in Langley. Too expensive. If you have a Rite-Aid card they have some great non-perishables and specials. I never go up to Oak Harbor to shop - I haven't set foot in a Wal-Mart in over 20 years.  

Specific things I look for in specific stores:  

Food Mart: I check the produce for specials or reduced price. I check the discounted items near the cat food. I get milk there. I check the meat - their 2 lb thick bacon is great, and they don't have a great selection but their prices are sometimes great. I often end up getting a steak or chops. They carry my favorite coffee - ~~Useless Bay~~ Honeymoon Bay ""Dead Man Walking.""  

Red Apple Clinton: Bread, Ice Cream, Frozen pizza, Canned goods, Salsa, etc. Meat is a crap shoot. Rarely have specials, but otherwise good selection but high price. Discount meats can be ... interesting. I've taken the chance before. Good for sauces and juices. Good liquor selection.  

The Goose: Bulk food galore! Grind your own Peanut Butter! Better produce selection,  but can be expensive. Eggs, milk, butter, some staples. Great for large size yogurt. Great for meat, seafood, deli. I get charcuterie here. Fair selection of liquor, but I worry about tipping over shelves with my cart. Interesting sales.  

Prairie Center: Produce, produce, produce! Great produce department. Good meat department, good sales. Rest is ... lackluster.

"Wow, that was really mean. 

Maybe I should have shared more? So let me start over. My name is Clint, father, husband, artist. I have 10 years of experience working with people with developmental disabilities. I've worked in residential, day programs, and as a host home provider (Literally opened up our house to care adults with disabilities 24/7 for the last 4 years). We moved to the Island in August to be closer to my wife's family. My son is 3 1/2 years old and being an only child I thought he would love some interaction with someone his own age. I think this is a great idea to give a break to other parents who may not have as much support as us. Parents get an hour to shop, plus take their drawings home and color them at home, thus giving parents another break. Also, if you just have issues with male instructors; Jamie, the owner of the Artists Collective, will be present for the hour. 

I'm %100 okay with people not liking my art. If it's not for you then move on. Also, I had no idea Myspace was still a thing, that's funny. I'm pretty sure that was supposed to be Clintorous sounding like Victorious but I don't think I was a great speller in middle school.

"I looked at your website, your art style, and what I can find does not lend me to trusting my children with you.

Art: It is creepy and disproportionate, disconnected from reality, and uncreative. Every image shares the same theme: One dilated pupil, paint bucket fill colors from an oversaturated palette, a focus on the grotesque. It is something I would expect out of a 90's grunge band, and not a children's art exhibition.

You: Myspace name of ""clintorous""... supposed to phonetically sound like **Clitoris**?

"Hey everyone! Are your kids interested in drawing a bigfoot? I'm offering classes on Tuesdays 3pm at the Whidbey Artists Collective! $10 a kid and you can go shop at Good Cheer uninterrupted for a whole hour! I'll teach your kids how to draw some characters and they can take them home to color! If you're interested please call or text me, Clint! Hope you all have a great week!

Edit: sorry, with the excitement of posting this and a 3 year old distracting me I forgot to mention. Parents are more than welcome to stick around but I do suggest that parents take a step back and maybe do some browsing around the Collective or bring a book. I have found out that if parents hover over their kid, most of the time, they end up doing the project themselves. My goal is for the kids to create something completely on their own and have the satisfaction of being able to tell their parents ""hey, look at this! I did this all by myself!""

And covid precautions will be in place. No entry without a mask, clean supplies will be provided with hand sanitizer available, and 5 students max per class. So please call to reserve your spot.

Sweet photo.  We moved here about 2 1/2 years ago to Oak Harbor from Texas. I’d been to the region a number of times but had never heard of Whidbey Island or Oak Harbor (though I had heard of Anacortes on an island).  My wife needed a colder climate and a sister church to the one I pastored in Dallas needed a pastor.
