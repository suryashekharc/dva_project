"Except for the Latin Kings, MS-13, the fentanyl and other drug traffic coming up thru PVD and 1-95...

The NBPD SRO quite literally prevented a Columbine style shooting in 2001. 

The NBPD already has a co-response program they dispatch an EMT riding with an officer to emotional disturbed person calls. 

They have a diversion program where a clinician literally rides with an officer to repeat drug offender calls to offer clinical support and intervention. 

The LEAD program let's officers use discretion for low level drug crimes to refer offenders to behavioral and mental health services versus criminal charges. 

I'm certainly all for Police reform but you just seem very uninformed about the city and the NBPD.

"🚩🚩🚩🚩WARNING to all young people!! This appears to be a sexual predator! Do not email this person. This man’s reddit history is full of looking for sex escorts, submitting himself for prostitution, and asking where to get sex workers. It is very concerning that he specifically asks for your age and that you live in NB. He specifically even asked for high school age individuals. 🚩🚩🚩 He is clearly looking for young individuals to try to have sexual experiences with after his two escorts recently moved and he’s looking for new escorts. This does not seem to be a legitimate candidate for political office. His work history is uber, lyft and door dash. He also claims to be progressive (aka against conservatives) yet his reddit history shows his support for Trump and anti-Biden comments. In addition, red flag, he is requesting individuals who do not support police. AKA so you won’t report him after he tries sexually harassing you. BEWARE!!

Black whale best seafood downtown …. I agree with the other post whaling museum is a must hit.  Fort tabor is a cool outdoor walk if you like checking out old forts.   Fairhaven center is cool for views as well and just on the other side of the river the swinging bridge in new bedford is one of a handful left in operation pain if you get stuck at it opens up for boats for 15 min every hour.  The nook in Fairhaven has amazing coffee the local buzz is their coffee milk specialty drink it does not disappoint.  If you want authentic Mexican LaRaza is the spot.  Tia Maria’s downtown is a great spot to hit for breakfast they got Portuguese twist on their menu and it’s right next to the whaling museum.

"I just moved out of my $900/mo apartment because the cost of living has gotten so bad it no longer makes financial sense to live far away from Boston and commute into the city. The unit is now listed at $1300. I moved in with one roommate and my rent only went up by $100 in Boston. 

/u/Codspear has the macro-level housing issues nailed down but there are also Covid effects with the housing supply too I think. Over the past year lots of folks hunkered down and didn't want to move due to the virus, creating a shortage of available rental units and houses for sale. 

With rentals, the shortage was made even worse because landlords didn't want to risk listing available units on the open market while the eviction moratorium was active. Anecdotally my own landlord filled most of the vacancies during Covid through word of mouth connections; the units never hit the open market. This exacerbated the appearance of a rental shortage and drove up the prices of the few units that did hit the open market.

"It’s happening everywhere. Check out the rent prices in Boston, Quincy, Cambridge, Somerville, etc. They’re ridiculous and pricing out the middle class who work in Boston, so those middle class people are now moving to the cheaper, somewhat-commutable areas around the city like Taunton, Middleboro, Bridgewater, Attleboro, Plymouth, etc, displacing working class people in those areas. The displaced working class people from those areas now only have two cities that are still cheap enough that they can barely afford to live in: New Bedford and Fall River. This process has been slowly increasing in speed for 20 years but went into overdrive in the past 5, rapidly increasing the population of both cities. Since the cities haven’t seen much growth in nearly a century (they slowly shrank from 1920 until around 2000), there hasn’t been a need for much new housing to be built. The surplus housing supply created by the previous shrinkage kept the cities cheap for decades, but it’s now been filled and things are going to get much worse, see below.  
  
Since Massachusetts isn’t building anywhere near enough housing for the population growth, it’s now going to be a game of musical chairs, except you only get a chair (housing unit) if you can outbid however many others want it. The number of players though, some wealthier than you and I, keeps increasing faster than the number of chairs, therefore the price of each chair will continue to increase until people stop moving in or until they start building new units faster than they’re adding people. Eventually, there will be an equilibrium, but no one knows where it will be.

"I'd you definitely want to take a walk around downtown.  Go to the Whaling Museum, it's pretty unique to the area and even having lived here for three decades+, I still enjoy going once every couple months.  

Between the Whaling Museum, and just wandering around downtown you can easily take up a couple afternoon/evenings.  There's more than enough history, shops, restaurants, and bars.  If you want to have a *nice* sit down meal in that specific area I'd say Cork, Carmine's, Merrill's, Black Whale, or Fathoms.  

Moby Dick Brewery is awesome too, but I'd say go there more for lunch, or for just a drink at night.

If you're looking for just a drink at night, Pour Farm all the way.  Not that there food isn't good, it is, but the aforementioned are better.  Pour Farm has the absolute best beer selection though.  

I'd check out Play Arcade too if you're into retro and modern arcade machines, plus their rooftop bar gives you an awesome view of the waterfront.  


I'd recommend taking a ride around the south end peninsula.  If you have the time, go to Fort Taber and take a walk through it.  There's also a wonderful military museum there, free of charge.  

If you make it to the south end, stop by Cisco.  Food is average (in comparison to the restaurants I mentioned before), but it has an amazing beer garden that's right on the water.  

Now, you said your trip might be in the next few weeks, if it's in October, absolutely take a drive through Acushnet if you're into sort of fall and farm activities.  Some great apple orchids, pumpkin patches, hay rides.

">If there will only be 7 units of affordable housing why don't they build a 7 unit apartment building? That's about the same amount of units as the building next door.

This is the unfortunate reality of overly restrictive zoning bylaws and a convoluted process for development. The market rate units are to subsidize the massive legal, engineering, and construction cost of the project. The developers aren't going to eat a close to 7-figure lawyer bill - they pass it on to the renters. 

If you want more affordable units, reduce the red tape for development. If apartments were an as of right development I bet you'd see more affordable rent.

Edit

It sounds like all of those units are affordable based off of Area Median Income (AMI). There are two thresholds for affordable housing-  those making under 50% of the AMI and those making under 80% of the AMI.

He said that 68% would be for people who make $50,000 per year. Nearly twice the average income of new bedford.

So 68% is for double the average income and 13% is for people who actually need affordable housing and the remaining 19% of people I guess would be for people who make even more than twice the average income for the city of New Bedford.



More of this housing is for rish people than for people who make affordable housing.

"That is definitely one reason, but there are many other factors combined that led to such growth, both shared and unique to each. For an example of a shared factor, most of the aforementioned cities are closer to the major job centers in Boston/Cambridge and along Rt.128/I-95, attracting more white collar commuters. An example of a unique factor would be Worcester’s case, where the UMass Medical School and WPI have enabled the city to catch some of the regional biotech industry growth for itself. Another would be UMass Lowell’s specialization in engineering and the remaining legacy of the Massachusetts Miracle (MA was the East Coast analogue of Silicon Valley from the 50’s to the 80’s) in the area.  
  
So South Coast Rail will help, but the primary growth factors for New Bedford and Fall River will be continued working/middle class displacement from Greater Boston and the need for regional secondary support industries (e.g. medical equipment manufacturing, increased regional warehousing/logistics centers). The offshore wind industry should also add to the local economy, supplementing the fishing fleet as a financial anchor on the waterfront.",t2_4btd5hg0,Codspear,0,1631145588.0,0,t1_hc4f3mc,hc4f3mc,False,ComradeKevin86,t3_pkklkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/newbedford/comments/pkklkz/population_boom_in_new_bedford/,Population boom in New Bedford?,/r/newbedford/comments/pkklkz/population_boom_in_new_bedford/hc4f3mc/,9,r/newbedford,0,9

"Due to Greater Boston’s inability (NIMBY unwillingness) to construct enough housing to meet the increasing demand of the region’s booming economy, the working and lower-middle classes are being priced out of the core metro area and pushed to the old industrial cities of Eastern MA. New Bedford is one of the beneficiaries of this, growing from 95k to 101k people over the past decade and returning to the same population level it had in 1970 before the second wave of deindustrialization hit.  
  
Nearly all other cities similar to New Bedford in Eastern MA grew. More examples below:  
  
Fall River 89k -> 94k

"That's a pretty nice neighborhood.  Pretty much anything between Ashley Blvd and Church St will be nice, especially north of Tarkiln Hill.  If their commute involves highway driving, King's Highway is a bit of a mess right now, but it's in the process of being redone so it should be a smooth ride soon enough.  There are police and fire stations right next to the Cumberland Farms shown on the map, and the neighborhood's within walking distance of GNBVTH, which last I heard was in better shape than NBHS as far as academics go.  Plenty of gas stations, the neighborhood's pretty much dead center between Stop & Shop and Trucchi's, so grocery trips are easy, it's a 5-minute straight shot down the Blvd to get downtown, and most importantly, Gary's Best is just across the Blvd.

On the other hand, a friend of mine *did* have her purse stolen a few years back from an open car window while she was pumping gas at the nearby Cumberlands, even though it's 2 lots down from the police station.

"Poor City Planning.

""Restoring"" and the constant maintenance of the New Bedford / Fairhaven bridge was a choice. [In 2015 a study was done](https://www.mass.gov/doc/chapter-5-1/download) to find the best option for the aging swivel bridge. Two recommendations were made; a Tall Vertical Lift Bridge, and a Double-leaf Dutch-style Bascule Bridge. New Bedford decided against the better alternatives (even though the study gives very in-depth reasons for the recommendations) and decided to restore the existing structure.

Then they decide on a schedule that they continue to not adhere to causing fuckloads of people to have to wait 15 minutes to pass with all options to go around taking at least that much time. I can't even count the number of times I have sat and waited with no boats going through. No other place in the country has a scheduled policy to stop current traffic to open for no reason. It's maddening.

I don’t know about calling the planners short sighted. I’m sure there’s a lot of stupid constraints they have to deal with that we aren’t aware about.

"More like gross incompetence in city planning. Look around and you will see failed city projects everywhere. I will always go miles out of my way to take the highway to avoid driving through New Bedford. None of the roads make any sense and the potholes everywhere cost me money in car parts.

Here is one example of so many New Bedford roadway atrocities:

There is a 4 lane highway only 2 miles long going from one depressed residential area to another depressed residential area, sending you flying past the historic district, which they are trying to promote for tourism, but there is no tourist parking and only one hotel which is always booked. They are constantly re-routing the side street entrances to the highway to the point that I dont even bother going to any of the businesses there anymore. And if you are coming over the Fairhaven/New Bedford bridge, there is no entrance to go south on 18, only north. If you want to go south you have to go a mile around the historic district (or a mile out of the way on the waterfront side), where  traffic is usually congested, and it's riddled with potholes and one-way streets.

No. The city planners are short-sighted fucking idiots who have got to be as corrupt as they are stupid to have so many roadway projects always under construction with the end result worse than when they started.

"Hello and welcome! Sorry this is so late, but (before covid) you could take wheel throwing pottery classes at the New Bedford Art museum (just Google the museum and ""adult classes"") along with other classes. I think nowadays they will rent out the wheels to people for a month and do online sessions. There are also a handful of museums in downtown NB you could always check out.

Additionally my neighbor runs this cute FB group called ""south coast stash and dash"". It is about 4k members, very active, family-friendly, and free. Individuals hide little treasures in places and post photos of the spot for others to find.

"The art scene is thriving downtown and at the Kilburn Mill in the south end.  I'm getting old and not really ""with it"" anymore, but if you go down to the Kilburn Mill, there are flyers all over there for art and music events around the city and you'll find plenty of people to talk to about that stuff.  

There's a ton of live music downtown on the weekends, Cisco's in the south end has live music seven days a week right now.  

The New Bedford Farmers Market has three locations right now on different days.

They also have an indoor market all winter long.  


There are tons of farms and farm stands nearby in South Dartmouth and Acushnet.  I like Brix Bounty and Paskamansett Farms.  Both are only 10 minutes from Umass.  Paskamansett is the only place locally to get raw milk, if you're into that.  

In Acushnet, Silverbrook and Keith's are two of my favorite places in the fall to visit.  Keith's has some absolutely delicious homemade pies and apple cider.  Silverbrook has some great stuff too.

It was literally printing money before he bought it.

Thirsty Whale was super awesome until it was sold too (the old homeport) and they got rid of the kitchen. Super cheap burgers and clearly their scallop specials skipped the fish house and went straight from boat to bar.

I don't think there are going to be any massive problems there.  They're trying to attract middle to upper class clientele.  I'm pretty sure they're going to price out most college age kids and low income.  

I mean, Libads was pretty cheap, and even though Friday and Saturday nights there were kind of sketchy (at least compared to the Belmont days), they never had any *major* problems there.

"My wife and I live in the Riverside lofts. Been here almost 2 years. It is our Kindof living with underground parking and we have water views and 6x12’ windows. It’s at the top of your budget(and ours) for a 2br with water views on the second floor but it really has been nice. 2 miles from downtown, north up the river. Quick ride to Acushnet Creamery too.... it’s a converted mill building about 6 years ago, there are a few around, and if you are into the brick walls, refinished original floors and high ceiling aesthetic (we are) it is real nice. They did a good job. You can request a tour.

Draw backs are it’s not the nicest area but we go for walks, runs and bike rides around the parks nearby with no issues. You are not in the center of the town so it’s a bit secluded in that sense, which can be a pro or a con. Also, thin walls and floors so you get to hear the neighbors lol. (Get top floor if you can). Also heat can be a bit pricey in our unit because we have extra windows and they are large. Less an issue in other units. No dogs unless service dogs. Cats I think are allowed.

There is another building next to us, and one about 1.5 miles south called Wamsutta, that permits dogs.

"Hi all,
I used to be president of the New Bedford Bike committee...we worked a good amount to get the city to comply with better/safer biking options. As bikers, our group knew what streets should have “sharrows”. The city worked with us to paint these in these key streets we identified to connect the whole city...unfortunately, the band broke up and it appears the city stopped keeping up...some of these bike sharrows we had them paint have faded. Some parts of the city were nearly impossible to try to connect. For example, there was a challenge on the South End on Cove St. I suggested to the city to see if we can use the existing hurricane barrier instead of the street. They took this on and hence the “Hurricane Barrier” bike path was born. Unfortunately, that path is less used by bikers and more used by walkers. It was not built as multimodal so the path is is not very wide. But at least it is an option. I say all this because if you all want to see better, then contact the city and tell them your ideas. Mitchell was willing to work with us and comply so I suggest doing so and or getting involved 😁.

"I live in off 8th st. Stones throw from Gallery X. I love where I live and my apt is bright and airy. I’ve spent many nights walking around and never felt unsafe. Rent is cheap. Night life is not great but it’s a small city and new options seem to appear every year for better nightlife options. Only complaints from me when living in downtown is the parking situation (no resident parking as all parking in downtown is metered). I have sent an a couple emails and letters to the city about this as there has to be better options for residents that want to live in its downtown core. For example, Boston, NYC, etc has options for its residents by paying for a sticker every year to park on street. I lived in downtown Providence right before this and had the option to buy a resident parking permit for a yearly fee (about $200) very close to my apt. Here there is no reasonable option and the frustrating part is that the parking meters around me are heavily under utilized/used. The option the city gives you to purchase is an area that is about a 15 minute walk from my apt. At least give me the option to pay a yearly fee to park at the meters as a resident who contributes to your local economy!

"Gonna piggyback this comment to say Victoria Riverside was a great place to live.  The only true downside was the lack of sound-isolation.  The floors and ceilings are all original aka not insulated for sound or heat transfer.  I lived on the 2nd floor and had 2 separate downstairs neighbors; one who blasted his (honestly pretty impressive) sound system at 8AM on weekends, and one who had 2 small children who visited on weekends.  Both could be heard clear as day, despite the fact that we had a ton of carpets and pads covering the floors in every room.  The historic floors are lovely, but they sure as hell weren't designed for quiet living.  I can't speak for Riverbank, but I've heard that the Wamsutta lofts are even worse-off with their sound issues, especially since they allow tenants to own dogs.

Aside from the sound issues, it was still honestly a positive experience all around.  Giant windows for natural light to pour in, 18' ceilings, interesting architecture, a pretty friendly community, private parking in the basement garage, an overnight front door security guard, a loading dock & service elevator for moving in/out, plenty of kitchen storage, accommodating maintenance, a rentable function room, in-unit laundry/hot water heater/HVAC, exposed ductwork, the opportunity to live right by the water, being walking distance from the feast.

I mean, I live south of Hazelwood Park, but I don't really think the part of the southend you're talking about is *that* terrible anymore (though hopefully it is even better with the safety center).

"I've done a quick creep-check of your history, and I'm...confused.  You were a lawyer, left that and obtained credentials in software development, but are now looking for a job on a fishing vessel?

Intriguing career path aside, I'm worried your expectations of sea life are going to set you up for disappointment.  Unless you strike gold and land a gig with the world's cheeriest fishermen, I think you'll find less sea shanties and bonding over quaint mugs of beer, and more silver-tongued banter over cigarettes and 30-racks of PBR.  I'm sure there's a sense of togetherness when you're at sea for days or weeks at a time with the same small crew, but you might be over-romanticizing it a bit.  Not to mention, with your white collar history, I'm hesitant to say you'll find a good fit among a fishing crew.  I don't mean this as an insult to the industry, but fishermen in NB don't generally tend towards academic.

If you're truly desperate for a local fishing job, maybe try getting in touch with the owner of Fathoms on Pope Island.  I believe he owns the fleet of scalloping boats downtown.

Funnily enough we just moved here last year lol. I really like volleyball but it's been hard trying to find a local recreational league. The closest is Somerset.

We tried the bristol bike path today. The pavement is AMAZing if it weren't for so many sticks! The view was beautiful though.

"North of King's Highway is much nicer than the rest of the city. It's very suburban and full of nice single family homes. I think it's cheaper than the surrounding area just because it's still New Bedford and people avoid it because of its reputation.

There's lots of good hiking in Freetown and Acushnet, or a little further away in South Dartmouth and Westport.

It's only about half an hour from Horseneck Beach in Westport.

Fort Phoenix in Fairhaven is a good walking/beach spot about 10-15 minutes away.

There's some great local restaurants in downtown New Bedford, and just about every chain restaurant you can think of along Route 6 in North Dartmouth.

Local attractions would be the Whaling Museum in NB, or Buttonwood Park Zoo in NB, which is a small zoo but really nice and memberships are cheap for NB residents.

New Bedford is also within easy driving distance of a lot of places. Without traffic, it's about an hour to Boston, half an hour to Providence, and 45 minutes to get on the cape. Keep in mind though it's about 2 hours to or from Boston during rush hour.

Also, if you're unaware, South Coast Rail will be bringing Boston commuter rail service to New Bedford starting around 2023 (not sure if it's delayed due to COVID) and there's a station planned for near King's Highway.",t2_e7vp9,todays-tom-sawyer,0,1597684876.0,0,t1_g1vu9n2,g1vu9n2,True,nasm1995,t3_iaj2zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/newbedford/comments/iaj2zg/possibly_moving_to_new_bedford/,Possibly moving to New Bedford,/r/newbedford/comments/iaj2zg/possibly_moving_to_new_bedford/g1vu9n2/,4,r/newbedford,0,4

"Keep in mind the taxes. Live in NB currently but thinking of leaving. Taxes keep creeping up and going up again next year. Look at nearby cities and towns, taxes are much lower. 

Live in north end. Very safe, plenty of restaurants nearby. As far as stuff to do, most things require travel to downtown, other towns nearby.

That would be the north end and yes it's safe the entire city is pretty safe just use some common sense.
