"You are in “the sweet spot” area quite coveted for its warmer weather.  

There is an invisible water line that kinda follows up highway to Haleakala.  Think of Haiku-Makawao side as rainy & Pukalani, Kula as dry.

Wailea Kihei was a virtual desert b4 developers brought in tons of sand & landscape & building up over a desert that does not get as much rain.  Hot & windy Kihei.  Wailea has great hotels, restaurants & shops.  Kihei is easy & breezy.

Hana is East side & rainy…where our jungle is the most jungliest!  

You lucky dude to live Westside.  I am old Tutu (grandmother type) & live Upcountry away from our lovely tourists-welcome back.

"I think Kihei and Lahaina people will both point the finger at one another saying the other is hotter. I'm Lahaina born grown and raised. It's fucking hot here. But I'm talking about Lahaina town from Puamana to Wahikuli neighborhood where the police and fire station is located. After that from Kaanapali to Kapalua things change. You can see the wind like on the ocean when you're looking out towards Molokai more so in the afternoon. That's a game changer. It's also not just the westside anymore. It's Northwest. So you get some of the Hookipa-like and lower Haiku weather and surf further north from Lahaina. 

Kihei is hot. But Kihei has Haleakala which can do them some favors west Maui will never benefit from. Evenings can get chilly if the wind comes down the side of the crater just right in certain areas. If Kona's are blowing the whole state is screwed. No one likes Kona winds.

"A typical intersection has people accumulate and cross all at once, when the light changes. The omnipotent light decides when people cross.

Without a stop light, you have people crossing individually or in small groups as they approach. Every pedestrian who wants to cross needs to wait for drivers to stop, make eye contact, get waved on... Across four lanes of traffic. Then those drivers move on, another one to five kids waits for the next driver to stop, and that cycle repeats for an hour or so twice a day.

"Honestly, I think the future of Maui won't be too dissimilar to what Oahu is today.  World population continues to increase, number of worldwide millionaires continues to increase, worldwide instability remains fairly constant enough for foreign people to want to park their assets in lucrative foreign housing vs keeping their money in their country, etc etc.  

At a certain point, I think you either accept that there will never be enough housing, slow or stop building, and just let the market sort itself out so as to keep Maui more 'country', or you greenlight building to try and help offset demand at the cost of becoming like Oahu.

I don't really see any other alternative, since I don't think things like banning foreign ownership of property are legally even possible.

"Hi! I'm from the Big Island but have lived on Maui for about a year. I'd visited before, and my sister lived here for a few years, but I had never spent substantial time here.

First thing, Maui is MUCH more expensive than the Big Island. The housing here is actually ridiculous. And yes, it's harder to get away from tourists, and perma-tourists, those people who live here but are sort of, like, permanently on vacation. On BI it's pretty easy to stick to areas that are mostly residential with normal people going about their normal lives, but here almost everywhere you go will have people in ""vacation mode."" Personally, I find this exhausting.

That being said, Maui has a lot of beautiful spots and I am enjoying my time here. We've made some good friends and have had fun seeing how Maui is different than the Big Island. And it is nice to have a Whole Foods for when you need weird ingredients and a Barnes and Noble for browsing books. Plus, Maui is so much smaller that we spend a lot less time driving.

But honestly, we are here for work too and are actively applying for jobs back on the Big Island. First, it's home. Second, we are tired of paying well upwards of $2000 a month for an apartment the size of a shoebox. You practically have to promise your first born child and we will never own so much as a condo here. It feels unstable and scary and makes living off the grid in the yurt next to my Dad's house look like a great option.

Of course, none of this is Maui's fault, it's just some garbage that it's currently going through. Honestly, I think the best thing that could happen to Maui is for it to become less trendy. After living here, I honestly hope that the Big Island never becomes fashionable.",t2_1msn8is6,NoxAtraEtNimbosaFuit,0,1647808172.0,0,t1_i1g3177,i1g3177,True,[deleted],t3_tist4s,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/tist4s/moving_from_bi_to_maui/,Moving from BI to Maui.,/r/maui/comments/tist4s/moving_from_bi_to_maui/i1g3177/,1,r/maui,0,1

"Hey!  I can recommend some great beaches that are easy to get to and have shady spots to stay cool and get out of the sun. 

I call this beach moms beach cause I take my MIL there cause it’s easy to get too unfortunately the recent flooding in Kihei has made it not as good but still a nice spot to chill. 

It’s in Kihei it’s called Mai poina beach park.  It’s right past sugar beach.  If you go towards the end there is some great spots to park and the beach is right there.  Bring some chairs and there is shady spots available.  Early morning is great here. 

Another great spot is papalaua beach park(ukumehame). There is a perfect spot to park in the middle near the pay phones and the porta potty. Look for the yellow lifeguard floaty and there is a perfect sandy entrance spot to the beach right to the right of it.  Fantastic beach to setup at. Lots of shade and pretty easy entry and exit. 

Haycraft park.  In maalaea at end of hauoli street.  If you have a handicap placard. Park in handicap spot. Get here pretty early and there is some good shady spots to setup.  

Kanaha beach park. There is some really nice spots here. Go into the last parking lot at the end of the road heading to kanaha.  Right before the bike path. Park near the handicap spot and the handicap bathroom. Walk straight from there. Fantastic beach with shade and easy entry and exit. Has bbqs available and showers.  Really good spot to just relax.  Best on weekdays. Weekends get busy. 

Dm me if you need other suggestions or better directions. 


Also highly recommend Iao park for bbqing and chilling. Great spot. 

Here is a picture of the beach at kanaha from today.

"Check out the lawn by The Mana Kai Maui / Five Palms restaurant. Lots of friendly people, and nice palms for shade.  

Look for beaches with lawns and shade, for your condition. 

If you can / would have a dog, consider adopting one that you can take on walks or to the beach. The right pet can be a massive people magnet.

You could also volunteer for your favorite local causes: that's a way to meet lots of people.

Is there a lupus support group on the island? Another potential source of connections.

Figure out what you're passionate about, and then find activities that align with your passions.

If you're not sure there's a need, pick up the phone and call someone at the organization you're interested in and ask them who you should talk to.

Maybe join an exercise class at the aquatic center. Maybe get a gig, like pettsitting? Maybe volunteer to help people on the phone.

The islands, like life itself, are full of almost unlimited opportunities to help others and thereby make our own lives richer for having done so.

"Property tax suggestions:
Primary resident condo/homeowners 0.0%,
2nd home 2.0%,
3rd  5%,
4th 20%,
5th home and up 25%. (Think Larry Ellison who maintains over 2 dozen PERSONAL residences on Lanai. This is in addition to the over 500 homes he owns in Lanai City, or Oprah who also owns dozens of homes on Maui as well)
Vacant land 0.5% (unless occupied by landowner in tent, RV, other structures or used for genuine agriculture purposes. Than 0.0%.)
Apartments bldgs, condos or homes that are certified & occupied long term rentals .5%
Timeshares hotel and vacation rental properties that the owners do not live in 5%.
On new sales- Any primary resident property with a value 300% of the county median home/condo price shall pay property tax on 1% if values above 300% of median. 
Say median home price is 1M. Your Home is worth 3M, tax would be 0.0%. If your home is 4M Your tax would be 1% of 1M =10,000usd.
This would avoid someone with a 20Musd primary resident home paying 0.0% property tax. Again, new sales only. We don’t want to tax Auntie out of her family house she grew up in just because it’s sitting on the beach and now worth 20M. These properties would still be 0.0% until a new sale occurs. We would have to phase all this in over 2-5 years so to avoid a rash of foreclosures by those that could not afford the new tax structure.
IN THE END  the simple human with ONE primary residence home, condo or land would pay NO property tax.

"Good explanation

> one thing that pops to my mind is liability if someone gets injured on your property.

In most states that is only something like an abandoned mine shaft (they are hugely dangerous).  If the property is in natural state, and a trespasser trips on a rock, tumbles off a cliff or is hit by a falling rotting tree -- all events that occur in nature -- it is not deemed the property owner's fault.

If there is a building on the site and a trespassers walks by and a wall falls and hits him (shoddy construction) -- well, yes, that is lawsuit justification.  And how often does this happen?  It is mostly in Hawaii where property owners have to freak out about liability from people traversing their property -- that's because the Legislature caved to Hawaii's personal injury attorneys and allows  all sorts of ridiculous personal injury lawsuits.",t2_16uqw4,Markdd8,0,1647548256.0,0,t1_i12ba32,i12ba32,False,Weekly-Chocolate-805,t3_tdh9md,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/tdh9md/dont_block_emergency_access_gates_mahalo/,Don’t block emergency access gates Mahalo,/r/maui/comments/tdh9md/dont_block_emergency_access_gates_mahalo/i12ba32/,1,r/maui,0,1

"Most teachers don't stick around here and wouldn't be able to afford a house if they were half the price they are now. I've also read that teaching is hardly a ""long term"" career like it used to be. Some travel nurses are doing 80-100k per year and that is still not enough to buy a home here.

Telling a local that can afford a second home/property not to buy is ridiculous. How do you know they aren't using the rent money to put their children through nursing/teaching degrees? Or plan to give it to their children?

No matter what, Maui will always have housing issues going forward. The larger issue that needs solved is the fact that the entire financial paradigm is set up to mostly benefit the 1%. Mauinow says 70% of homes were bought by non-owners, but they won't follow up and find out how many homes were bought by investment corps. Make no mistake, the cost of housing is going up because mega corporations are buying everything. There is absolutely 0 politicians in Maui addressing that, and local and federal representatives are absolutely in servitude to this corporate syndicate.

"The weather, the cost of living including rent is rising rapidly of late so who knows when that'll plateau, depending on which part you go to the people vary massively.

On the plus side taxes and deductables are deducted automatically by most employers, healthcare really is free at point of service (prescriptions require a contribution in some case) and everything is convenient in terms of delivery or collection.

"Some important quotes from the article:  

> ""About 70% of purchases in 2020 were non-owner occupied, second homes, Hawaiʻi Information Service said.""

and 

> StormoGipson added that she receives questions on out-of-state homebuyers, whose purchases have increased in recent years. A state report said 38 percent of homes last year were bought by offshore buyers, with many from Canada and California.

So assuming that nothing dramatic is happening with how they record off-shore buyers, there is still a significant percentage of local buyers who are purchasing second homes as investment properties.

"When I did my touristy drive to Hana, even as an adept driver, I still wasn't familiar with the turns..  I had heard prior to my drive that if a non-rental car pops up speedily behind you, you pull over and let them pass. But letting a faster driver pass is common knowledge IMO anyway.

So when that it and I let them by, most times I got a 🤙 out the window for it, despite obviously being a visitor. Appreciation.

"Honestly, it’s about getting involved in the community, setting roots. I always tell anyone who wants to move to Hawaii that if they want to be a part of the community, a part of the culture, then they need to get into Canoe Paddling. Canoe Paddling, the canoe clubs? Immerses you in all aspects; you learn Hawaiian, you participate in a Hawaiian sport, you learn chants, enjoy amazing Hawaiian food, take part in a huge community event, and no one cares what you look like as long as you put in the time and effort. That’s the biggest thing. If you put the time and the effort, that’s all anyone cares about. Most people go about their days living the exact same lives they had back elsewhere. But here?

"I’ve avoided going Maui for this reason. I’ve never experienced anything like this on the Big Island. Maybe I’m oblivious but I always feel 100% comfortable whether I’m in Kona or Hilo, I get nothing but Aloha from the locals and I am a PASTY white Alaskan girl. On Oahu I have experienced a little—just certain places on the North Shore I’ve had some side eye but nothing major. And even then I get it, Oahu has a whole set of issues, especially on the north shore and can understand the locals’ frustration on that island.

"Being raised in Hawaii and have lived there for the majority of my life, one thing I understand about Hawaii: it is a place of neverending love and aloha but there is pain too. Moving out of Hawaii when I was 11 and then returning when I was 22, it broke my heart with how much has changed, my favorite places gone to be replaced by major corporate and tourist interests. Even though I felt the love for the culture and understood and respected Kanaka Maoli, I never imagined I would be a part of that and there is no reason for me to feel that. I honestly believe that, today, the idea of Hawaii is dying and Aloha is slowly fading away for the sake of tourism and wealthy greed. Hawaii is by definition a tragedy since the annexation to the current robbery of the land of the people. The Kanaka Maoli are fighting to maintain their right to their lands only to be kicked out by the wealthy mainlanders and foreigners that only care about the luaus and the beaches and not the people.",t2_bhawsodq,steevedafeesh,0,1647314283.0,0,t1_i0peap2,i0peap2,True,cmiles2730,t3_te3oh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/te3oh0/do_you_hate_tourist_ive_been_a_member_of_the/,"Do you hate tourist?

"I don't quite understand the real question here... is it tourism or racism ? 
In case of tourism, it's government responsibilities to restrict them, or level up the infrastructure because lets face the reality, we need them for income and tax.
In case of racism, treat other people the way you want to be treated, human nature is universal, no such thing as"" born  and raised"" vs "" new comers"" , I haven't run into any problem with the locals, let along its a place with huge number of mixed ethnic people, japanese..

Been living here about 9 mos, and it's just one of our life's great adventures.  

I cannot know all the wrongs that have ever been done here (and are still being done here), yet I can be sensitive to the history I DO know.

And more importantly, I can do my best to make it a better place, for a short time, because I was here.

When we got here, we were blessed to meet some other malihini with common interests (dogs) and they have become our on-island ohana. 

It's sure nice to be able to be able to create happy memories with them...or to go to a beach, or a sold-out show and think ""I'm sure I know someone here - where are they?"", only to receive a text with your pic 10 minutes later, showing you walking in.

"Some people are asking why there is a gate. I looked into this a little bit, and what I gathered is as follows. Note, I’m making assumptions on a very small amount of information, so I’m likely incorrect on some parts. 
- The end of the road where everyone used to park appears to be a private parcel, based on the latest County tax maps, zone 3 sec. 8 plat. 01. Which means everyone used to park on someone’s private property before the gate was installed.
- The end of the road is called out as an access easement, so the end might be a private easement and not a County road. Therefore the owner may be within their rights to install a gate where they did. Even if they are required to maintain beach access for the public, there’s no requirement to provide vehicular access for the public.
- I saw someone mentioned there was a homeless encampment there. If the point is actually a private property, other than the issue of rubbish, one thing that pops to my mind is liability if someone gets injured on your property. Another is adverse possession, where a trespasser can gain legal title to a property if they occupy it for a continuous amount of time, albeit a very long time.",t2_9yio7kn8,Leather_Ganache7474,0,1647290253.0,0,t1_i0nw62o,i0nw62o,True,Weekly-Chocolate-805,t3_tdh9md,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/tdh9md/dont_block_emergency_access_gates_mahalo/,Don’t block emergency access gates Mahalo,/r/maui/comments/tdh9md/dont_block_emergency_access_gates_mahalo/i0nw62o/,3,r/maui,0,3

"NOT WORTH IT.

Last fall, I was running 3 cars here.

It seemed like great, easy money at first - but then, supply caught up with demand in early '22.

And I had one vehicle rear-ended in early August which was a total nightmare, as I had to search almost 3 months before I found a body shop on the island who'd even agree to take on the work of repairs.  And then, that body shop didn't color match the paint well, so it's a noticeable repair. Lastly, I'm pursuing a lost rental income claim against the at-fault party's insurer.

Honestly, I quit - because it was too much of a distraction from how I REALLY make my living, and the rental prices plummeted.

Being off island, even for only 1-2 mos, you'll have to have someone physically here managing the rentals - service & maintenance, cleaning, questions, problems, etc. - which will take a good cut of your profits.

And it opens up a personal liability for you.  If something happens while the renter is driving the vehicle and someone is injured or killed?  Get ready to be sued for most or all of what you have, financially speaking.  Rentals should always be owned by an LLC, for asset protection.

What kind of car?  High-end, luxury sports, or something uber-desirable (like a unique ride: a Jeep, 'vert or 7-8 passenger van)?  Summer demand does of course run high, but if it's just a run of the mill sedan, it might cost  you more in headaches and time than you see in profits generated. On Christmas eve, I was able to rent a car for only $25 a day, for 1.5 weeks, at one of the major rental companies at the airport.  That's how LITTLE demand there was at Xmas/NY.

And in my experience, many renters (especially of average vehicles) are not careful with a rental car - unless, it's a VERY high end vehicle and you've covered yourself in the rental terms and/or via deposit (which means NOT using Turo to run your rentals).

There is damage and wear and tear to be expected, and it may be greater than what you'd put on it.

It will almost certainly be greater than what would happen if your vehicle was secured in a garage or under a car cover in your absence.

It’s just the same problem in California as why is everybody rich wants the beach for themselves and now you have these large subdivisions or groupings of mansions in front of the most beautiful beaches and security guard everywhere watching you like you cannot go anywhere for peace anymore unless you go far into the valley. I even one day was sitting at the beach and this couple from Ireland came to talk to me cause I’m a local sitting there so they start asking me questions then they start walking behind me down the beach and I see a security guard passed me towards them the security guard and the Irish couple start walking back and as they walk back past the security guard is telling this couple that the beach is private land and believe me I told the Irish couple to stop and so did the security guard and I yelled that security guard so far away I hope he quit his job for telling people they cannot be on the beach that it’s “private”! Like the beach that I slept at I still had two jobs some nights I would have to put all my clothes into a backpack or a trash bag so my work clothes would stay dry and I would just sit up in my swim trunks in the rain at 4 o’clock in the morning waiting to go to work at 6 am.. and just to get off of this beach I had to walk a quarter of a mile all the way around this grouping of mansions. One morning I was late for work and I tried to walk through the mansions I had a security guard chasing me between the houses yelling at me telling me I’m not allowed to be there.. I said other than why are you gonna fence off an entire quarter-mile along the beach So if I want to be over here I have to walk all the way around?

"Did you see the big disclaimer at the top of that article that starts with 'EDITORS NOTE' and it is followed by a retraction?

If you follow that link and read more about the retraction, it says, in part:

'A big problem with this study was the peculiar interpretation of the results by the authors. Their results, given in log copies per mL, show that surgical masks reduced median viral emission by 27.5% and cotton masks reduced median viral emission by 80.4%. Just the fact that a reusable cotton mask was more effective than a manufactured surgical mask was news worthy by itself. Instead, the public was misled to believe the masks were totally ineffective.

It is hard to understand how the authors deemed that an 80% reduction of viral emission constitutes an “ineffective” intervention. With 80% reduction of viral emissions writ large, tens of thousands who have died of Covid-19 might be alive today. Cotton masks have never been promoted as 100% effective, not even N95 masks are.

"They were looking to do an Air BNB type company buying homes/condos in Maui. My 2019 contract with realtor had some stipulations. One was that my condo would be sold furnished, as is. They didn't want to buy my furniture, and it was a low offer. It's a pet friendly 3 bedroom, 2 full bath in Wailuku. Now that prices are up I'm speaking to a different realtor to get me a much better price. It's my home and I'm not going to sell it cheap. I'd rather a family buy it not an investor. The other 4  condos above me are owned by investors that are pretty much slum Lords. The AOAO fees are going up each year and I'm tired of paying so much every month. I'm on a fixed income.

"Thank you for the response.

But the streambeds pass right under Iao Valley Rd. in cement tunnels and continue on the other side toward Iao stream. These streambeds are sizeable, deeply-cut gorges. They are major drainages and large volumes of water have clearly flowed through them and emptied into Iao stream historically. So if water is no longer flowing in those deep drainages on north side of the road....Why not?

The water coming down those waterfalls is not absorbed into the soil, most of it remains on the surface flowing through deeply etched drainages and emptying into Iao Stream. I have hiked up many gullies further up Iao Valley, up to distant high waterfalls, and even when there is just a very small volume of water flowing, it always finds its way down its gully and empties into Iao stream.

If water is not reaching the stream, then that's unusual/abnormal. Maybe the water flowing down the falls was a sudden flash-flood burst and the water just hadn't reached the lower part near the road...and if I had waited a while it would have arrived. That's a possibility, I guess.",t2_1dy0hc,Jezebel_Fairchild,0,1646881225.0,0,t1_i026632,i026632,False,Jezebel_Fairchild,t3_taobuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/taobuy/water_flow_in_iao_gullies/,Water flow in Iao gullies,/r/maui/comments/taobuy/water_flow_in_iao_gullies/i026632/,2,r/maui,0,2
"Those waterfalls only flow when its raining. It disperses and doesnt form a river path to the main river. Theres many elevation ridges from what you see to the river.

Ive even seen the water coming down right onto the right side of the road as you go into the park.

Just past the lower park at the gate. To the right there is a small ditch that runs underground as well. Theres another stream to the north that runs by the housing development.

"It’s a sign of globalization that isn’t necessarily permanent. I agree it is sad, but a common phenomenon that occurs on the mainland as well. It’s reversible, but it will take time as productive assets are developed and repatriated locally. No one — not even the most obnoxious mainlanders — wants for Maui to become just like Los Angeles. Despite the current discouraging trend, as long as we make efforts to equip Maui’s people with forward-looking skills and education, in the long run we can preserve local values. Our world for better or worse is a global collective and Maui, like many resource-rich locales, has been no doubt exploited. But this does not need to end with a tragedy of the commons.

"I think that is a serious mistake. The UK is extremely expensive, highly taxed, and worst of all a very class based society. They also made the mistake of following the populism route and in a fit of aggrieved petulance similar to our 2016 election opted out of Europe, which has not gone well for them nor will it go well in the future. It also means fewer work options if you have a UK passport as you can no longer work easily in Europe. I actually know a couple people who ended up leaving the UK, one before and one after Brexit. Both thought it was the best thing they ever did. To me going from Hawaii to the UK is leaving one sinking ship to hop on another one. 

On the topic of college, your kids will not be able to ""go to school for whatever they want,"" it doesn't work that way. Everyone in the UK has to take GCE A Level Exams in their equivalent of high school. These exams - with grades and extracurriculars - are used to determine whether your kid gets into university or not (at all) and then which university depends on their scores. So if you have kids that are very by the book, excellent students, great at taking exams, willing to put in years studying for a do or die set of high-stress exams that literally determines their entire future, then this is a good system. But if your kid is not like this, then basically they get permanently kneecapped at the age of 17 or 18.",t2_e5qrtny0,TakeMeToTheShore,0,1646845685.0,0,t1_hzzrssn,hzzrssn,False,xPhantomx482,t3_ta29ud,https://www.reddit.com/r/maui/comments/ta29ud/i_feel_so_sad_that_i_cannot_afford_anymore_to/,I feel so sad that I cannot afford anymore to live in the place that I was born and raised,/r/maui/comments/ta29ud/i_feel_so_sad_that_i_cannot_afford_anymore_to/hzzrssn/,14,r/maui,0,14

"I’m sorry you’re having to think about leaving too. I have to stay I’m glad you decided not to sell your condo to the Chinese corporation.

I see the opportunity for more if I move somewhere else so that’s what I’m going to do.
