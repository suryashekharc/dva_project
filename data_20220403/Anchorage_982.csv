"Yes. Special Primary in June, vote for one person. 

On August 16, we'll vote again. First, we'll rank the top four from the primary, and determine who will finish the remainder of Don Young's current term. 

It will also be the primary, so we will vote again for who we want to see on the ballot in November. We will choose one person for the house, one for the Senate (Murkowski's term ends), and state house and state Senate primaries. After this date, they will send the person who won the ranked choice round to DC. I hope it's Santa, because I want to see Santa on CSPAN. 

Then in November we rank the top four from the results of the August 16 ballot. 

So if you want, say Christopher Constant, you can vote for him four times in the next few months.

"Once you start getting beyond a few hours from Anchorage, you start to get into very sparsely populated areas.

The towns within about 2-3 hours of Anchorage are the following:

To the north, you have Wasilla and Plamer, rapidly developing towns which are quickly turning into a single small city as they grow together, Big Lake, a sleepy vacation town filled with cabins, Houston, a drive through highway town, and Willow, a small riverside community. Of those, the only hospital is in Wasilla at Matsu medical center.

To the South, you have Girdwood, which is a resort town that's technically part of Anchorage, Whittier, a fishing town that has a rather famous one way tunnel to access it, and Soldotna and Kenai, both small communities near the highway. All of these communities usually rely on Providence for their medical care.

Which is highly amusing to me, most nationally elected dems in office are center right and I find that most Alaskan dems are very center right. It feels like that these ""center right folks"" I speak to have positions that more closely align with the dems (including you). I've also noticed that when pressed, they usually end up getting stuck on a single issue, most often abortion or guns, and those specific issues keep them voting for more extreme right candidates and parties.

">Palin sucks and so does her kids. But her kids actions don’t make her who she is. 

Sure, just because Track Palin assaulted his own pa and then assaulted and refused to let a woman leave his home and demonstrates allegiance to the extreme far right doesn’t mean that’s who Sarah Palin is too.

But being as she *is* a Wasilla Republican who achieved and sustained infamy with her jingoist platform and paved the way for a white nationalist-lite president, it’s not surprising that her son is who he is.

"Yeah, but it's not really possible in Alaska. A lot of places on the map have no regularly scheduled flights between them. 

Not lecturing *you* OP but it occurs to me that a lot of people ask about traveling around Alaska without cars.  

It's like asking how to travel between (for example) Grand Junction, Colorado  and  Cleveland, Ohio in one week while sightseeing along the way.   Instead of being linked by various state/county/federal/interstate highways, rail, and regular airport service, imagine the following:  

1) the road only goes from Grand Junction to Denver, with no intercity public transportation; 

2) you can take a plane from Denver to Kansas City, but there's only a Dash-4 flight every three days or it's $900 each way; 

3) there are no roads into Cleveland at all; 

4) air service is limited to local small airlines with irregular schedules; 

5) in this hypothetical there's nothing but ocean and/or impassable mountains from the Mississippi River to the eastern Great Lakes.  There's a ferry service that is expensive, slow, and has an irregular schedule. If you don't have extra money for a cabin or they're sold out, you'll be sleeping on the deck. And you will have to make a connection with a two day layover in Peoria, Illinois (which also has no roads in or out); 

That's why it's hard to answer this kind of question.",t2_fy4fp4w5,fuck_face_ferret,0,1648877594.0,0,t1_i32sqqv,i32sqqv,False,Inevitable-Gap-6350,t3_ttqikx,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/ttqikx/marine_highway_trip/,Marine Highway trip,/r/anchorage/comments/ttqikx/marine_highway_trip/i32sqqv/,1,r/anchorage,0,1

While lead is known to be poisonous in its own right, one should keep in mind just how commonly lead was consumed before it became as tightly regulated as it currently is. Many believe leaded paint chips are solely responsible for the modern GOP.

"I grew up riding the ferries constantly bc I lived in southeast and my dad worked on them. I love the ferries. If you really just want a site seeing opportunity that will take you a few places, they would definitely work. A few things to keep in mind:
1. A lot of the ferry terminals are not located in the center of population areas like the cruise ship docks are. Juneau and Haines come to mind immediately. If you want to get off, or get back by a certain time, plan for a taxi or Uber. It also makes it hard to just leave for a bit to go do a quick grocery trip or whatever. 
2. How old is your kid? If they’re pretty chill they’ll be happy walking around or coloring or playing a handheld video game or something, but there’s nothing really to entertain them the way there is on cruise ships.
3. As I’m sure you’ve heard, Alaska is expensive. Buying ready made food will cost you a lot. The cafeterias on the ferries aren’t cheap or healthy either.

I’m not saying don’t do this, but I would plan out each step. The ferries wouldn’t be real conducive to a completely spontaneous “let’s just go where it takes us” trip. The ferry schedule is limited and you’ll end up staying in some skeezy places if you don’t book nicer yet affordable ones ahead of time. I would pick maybe two or three stops, if you can, and stay overnight or over a couple days and do things in each place. 

Lastly, I can’t overemphasize how big this state is. There’s no way you can see a large chunk of it in a short amount of time without feeling like you didn’t do anything. Pick a few areas within one smaller area and explore that.",t2_fl1wk5mv,BulkOlives,0,1648829996.0,0,t1_i300e4u,i300e4u,True,Inevitable-Gap-6350,t3_ttqikx,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/ttqikx/marine_highway_trip/,Marine Highway trip,/r/anchorage/comments/ttqikx/marine_highway_trip/i300e4u/,11,r/anchorage,0,11

"It heavily depends on what Russia's priorities are.

Alaska is important strategically due to its proximity to Russia and its strategic uses are threefold:

1. Interceptors can easily be scrambled from there to go after any Russian aircraft coming across the Pacific. This is mainly what JBER is for.

2. Air defense sites can be used to shoot down Russian missiles that are crossing the Pacific before they reach the US. This is what Ft. Greely is all about.

3. Radar and other surveillance methods can be used to detect Russian movements in the Pacific long before the reach the US, allowing time to mobilize a quick response and limits the ability to launch surprise attacks.

In theory, Alaska should be safe from a nuclear attack, either due to interceptors from JBER or missiles from Greely. Adding on to that the fact that Alaska has a very small population and, while resource rich, it takes a long time for Alaskan resources to get to the lower 48, Alaska doesn't seem like an appealing first target, especially when you consider how close many NATO countries in Europe are to Moscow. It will be a necessary target if Russia wants to use long range missiles or bombers against the West Coast, but I don't think that will be Russia's first priority if a total war were to break out.",t2_42z04bkv,ThrowACephalopod,0,1648791307.0,0,t1_i2y6haa,i2y6haa,True,ArcticExtruder,t3_ttilxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/ttilxr/whats_the_likelihood_of_anchorage_being_a_target/,"What's the likelihood of Anchorage being a target in this scenario?

"Seeking a recommendation for a house of worship is kinda like asking where the best hamburger is served or which massage parlor offers the happiest endings; folks are only able to relate their favorite (or their happiest) in their opinion.

Here's a suggestion for a different approach to finding ""the right"" church: Instead of depending upon the widely varying and biased minds of the many flavors of believer, seek out that congregation who place the highest value on the virtue of credulity, that is of a willingness or tendency to believe. It's important to highlight here just how dependent believers are upon parental approval. After all, religion is as heritable as eye or skin color; as we all know, very few stray from the teachings of mom and dad. The countries of the Middle East, for instance, still practice the faiths of their forefathers despite centuries of violent proselytizing by... well, just about everybody.

All churches have as their basis a book written by a hodge-podge of bronze age bedouins whose ignorance of how the world really works exceeded even that of a D-level Wasilla third-grader. This makes gullibility the keystone of faith.

And that brings us to the prime criterion by which to select a flock, begging the real question ya really gotta ask: which sheep believe the most outlandish, farfetched, crazy-assed stuff?

The best way to allay the concerns of the people who indoctrinated the believer (this is a core value among the faithful) in batshit insane dogma is to let them know you've done them one better and gone completely in on some REAL nonsense. Look to Mormonism, the freshest crap on the menu, because it offers the happiest endings to its adherents (you get your own planet when you croak).

"Well I can say from personal experience they get their produce from the same place as anyone else. They’ve been advertising their produce heavily though so I imagine that’s a propaganda effect. 
As for why? They treat their employees as expendable, cut hours, and still demand more. They also incentivize managers to treat their subordinates like shit. They pay people barely enough to keep them on. You only make good money by dumping half a decade into the company. Kids are wising up and asking more now, which the company has been forced to comply to, however that leaves the people who spent 5-10 years to barely get $25 an hour wondering where THEIR raise is.
Also sexual harassment and assault gets swept under the rug, and the work environment is generally toxic. 
Any money you spend at Fred Meyer goes straight to corporate, and anything you donate just goes towards padding their tax write offs. Oh and they barely make effort to discourage theft, regularly punish employees for the theft, and they get to write it off at the end of the year to boot.

"By the mayoral administration: 

* giving lucrative business contracts to outside business organizations, 

* giving those contracts out without competing bidding to fraternizing businesses,

* or by hobbling a city department so much that the Muni pays more to contract out for services. 

Along with cutting funding and services that cause disruptions (traffic funding was cut, our roads and plowing this winter are shit), and firing  or causing ""resignations"" in long-term city employees that take their knowledge with them (see library director retiring and Judy Eledge debacle as proxy director and trying to sell off valuable and rare Loussac library collections for profit, and 60% of the health department's management was fired/""resigned"", fired 1 Dr. with 15 years with Muni, and other Dr. resigned after decades).

See: Solid Waste Services is now being run by Dan Zipay, who owns 25% in Denali Disposal Services, and his daughter Bernadette Wilson owns 75%; daughter was a former campaign manager for Bronson. SWS is city-run, while Denali Disposal is a competitor.

The first Dr. hired for health department is a pediatrician with no infectious disease or epidemiology experience,  who had/has an ongoing lawsuit in New Mexico, and who is also the president of Alaskans for Real Cures for Homelessness,  which is affiliated with Save Anchorage/ Reclaim Midtown, many vocal members of whom own businesses near the Golden Lion Hotel, and are anti-homeless NIMBY. The Golden Lion was supposed to be a small homeless services connector. Health Department new director Joe Gerace was the former local director of Visit Health, a for-profit covid testing and vaccine company. It was discovered that an actual epidemiologist needed to be hired in the position that Dr. Savitt occupied, and so an other doctor was hired.

"Drive out to Eklutna lake (40ish minute drive north from you), spend some time walking around the lake (it’s a very popular spot but bring bear spray anyway) or if the lake is fairly calm and it’s sunny rent one of the kayaks! Mooses Tooth and 49th State Brewing in anchorage are musts for dinner, Glacier Brewhouse is also very good. South, Snow City or Bear tooth for breakfast (all these restaurants are extremely popular, expect a wait). Bear Tooth also has a dine in movie theater and is the sister restaurant to Mooses Tooth. Absolutely drive up to the Flat Top parking lot and go to the overlook of the city at the minimum, if you feel more adventurous go for a hike up Flat Top or any of the other mountains off the Powerline Trail up there (Little O’Malley is a good one). Pro tip for hiking Flat Top: there’s a trail that goes up the backside of the mountain that is much easier with less crowds and is more scenic, accessed off Upper Canyon Road. The end of that road is also the trailhead for a pretty flat but beautiful trail called Rabbit Lake. Flat Top is easily the most popular mountain hike around anchorage, the eagle river equivalent being Mount Baldy. Eagle and Symphony lakes trail is also located back in Eagle River and is very beautiful, although it’s rather long and flat and takes me roughly 5-6 hours. The museum is always fun and is free the first Friday of every month. You also MUST drive down the Seward highway, at least to Girdwood if not further or all the way to Seward. The 45 minute drive from South Anchorage to Girdwood is stunning and there are plenty of hikes to do in Girdwood (easier: winner creek trail, harder: mount alyeska- you can take the tram down for free if you hike up-, and the first couple miles of crow pass up to the lake are also beautiful). Go walk around the hotel in Girdwood and check out it’s shops and landscaping, grab some food at Jack Sprat, or Double Musky. Chair 5 is also good. Girdwood Brewing Company is also a must. While we’re on the micro-breweries topic, my favorites in Anchorage are Midnight Sun and Double Shovel Cidery. Whittier, 20 minutes passed Girdwood is also cool, if nothing else for the 2 mile tunnel you drive through and the fjord. The Portage Pass hike there is stunning as well, and although I usually stop halfway at the high point of the pass you can continue down the other side to get closer to Portage Lake and Portage Glacier. I also like the flatter Emerald Cove trail that hugs the shoreline, although it is more so tucked into the rainforest (this is a great place to find Salmon Berrys which should be in season in August! They look like orangeish raspberry’s). I would absolutely do one of the glacier boat tours in Whittier; there’s a few options but any of them are spectacular. They have one that’s like 5 hours and you see 26 glaciers or a 2ish hour where you see maybe 3-4 and honestly that was enough for me, even saw some whales breaching! A bit over an hour passed Girdwood is Seward which is spectacular with Exit Glacier and a charming town as well as the Sea Life Center. Seward is also big on the boat tours. The ones out of Whittier are generally better for glaciers, and the ones in Seward for wildlife (especially the whales), although you should get a bit of both in either case depending on your tour. Lastly, about an hour north of Eagle River is Hatchers Pass in the mountains outside wasilla. My favorite hike in the entire world, Reed Lakes is up there. Usually the snow is all melted by the beginning of July, just make sure to go on a sunny day and go all the way to the upper lake. It usually takes me about 5-6 hours round trip with some breaks, and although a longer hike, other than a couple spots it isn’t very strenuous or difficult as long as you have solid footing.",t2_67l88ipn,TurbulentSir7,0,1648663612.0,0,t1_i2qstel,i2qstel,False,Fabulous-Champion-13,t3_tnpz6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/tnpz6z/what_would_you_do_if_you_had_just_one_day_in/,What would you do if you had just one day in anchorage?,/r/anchorage/comments/tnpz6z/what_would_you_do_if_you_had_just_one_day_in/i2qstel/,1,r/anchorage,0,1

"It is very sporadic in terms of bushcraft/survival courses if you are thinking along the lines of being out in the woods with nothing. Bowmaking, hide tanning, frictionfire, primitive traps, cordage, shelter building, basketry, hunting tools, net making, bone tools, basic medicinal/edible plants, stone tools, etc. I know because I teach these things and have seen who offers what. 

There are lots of good courses out there as stated by other users that teach really important skills and do touch on some of the traditional survival skills. 
Homer/fairbanks folk school has some good classes throughout the year, worth checking out.
Also, there are a few native folks that still carry some of the old skills, but it is hard to find them. The heritage center has some classes here and there that may interest you.
Books are gold and there are a few great ones about traditional skills of alaska natives.

Right now I contract out only if people reach out and have worked with a handful of groups/corporations/schools/private classes in alaska (live in anchorage)

We generally list our places after we have made repairs and they are ready to rent. We typically list on a Friday, show the place on Saturday or Sunday, and sign a lease Monday or Tuesday (lease starting whenever it is relevant for our new tenants - sometimes immediate, sometimes a week or two hence).

No chance our places would be listed with availability the end of May. Our tenants are only required to give us 30 days notice. It's still March. We won't know what openings we will have at the end of May until the end of April at the earliest. And we probably won't bother listing something that's available the end of May until... the end of May. Trying to coordinate showings and applications while a prior tenant is still in the property is a lot of hassle we've never felt compelled to engage.

Weidner is an expert at charging you for things that they aren't allowed to charge you for. It is usually not quite illegal, but sitting down for an hour with a lawyer will be well worth your time. Don't sign anything until you do that.

"So instead of admitting you're were wrong, you just move onto being unnecessarily antagonistic, not sure why I'm surprised. 

Opening the windows when it is super hot is actually the wrong move. You leave them open at night while it is cool, and in the morning you shut the house up and lower the blinds to keep the sun out or install window tint that reflects some of the heat.  Which we already did.  It also doesn't work when we have wildfires, with climate change we will continue to have hotter and hotter summers with more fires.  

It is also one of the reasons I support moving to renewables and much greener sources of energy.  All information I've seen points to AC demands increasing dramatically throughout the entire nation.

Jot down the addresses of them. 

Head home and then look on muni.org as “property tax search” (google “muni Anchorage property tax search) at the addresses you jotted down. Should display the owners name.  Then google their name and seek a contact.

"it might surprise you but i already get taxed the fuck out of but for whatever reason it doesnt seem to be as debilitating for me as others like to claim it is for them. i dont use it as an excuse for not helping less fortunate people or anything like that. i also worked in australia when i was younger ive dealt with massive massive taxes on everything. its just not something that bothers me.

 i really enjoy the coast then theres some nice farmland ive looked at several times but i wouldnt be opposed to living in the city either. i normally dont like cities but ive really enjoyed several in canada. 

its not a i hate america im going to canada thing. its a i drove through canada when i was a teenager and found areas i loved and kept going back to them for decades thing figuring out if its the right area for me. i really really enjoy the cascadia bio-region ive spent my entire life enjoying it here in alaska canada and washington. ive been up and down the coast in boats doing it the legal way then just doing it without any regard for the laws with my grandpa. 

ive looked into all the requirements and everything i would need to do to get in its not beyond the realms of possibility. im sure i could get in via the skilled worker/trade program. ive already had job offers there in the past and started the application process but life came up as it does and i had to stop. i know i often come across as a prick on here but im also a fairly capable prick and ive got the funds and whatnot that theyd require. its something that if i werent kinda stuck where im at now for a while longer id be actively working towards but for the time being i gotta be here for a couple more years.",t2_5wt9j,cinaak,0,1648535428.0,0,t1_i2j9ekp,i2j9ekp,False,Interesting_Title559,t3_to9inn,https://www.reddit.com/r/anchorage/comments/to9inn/has_anyone_shipped_anything_from_canada_to/,Has anyone shipped anything from Canada to Anchorage?

"**[Unorganized Borough, Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unorganized_Borough,_Alaska)** 
 
 >The Unorganized Borough is composed of the portions of the U.S. state of Alaska which are not contained in any of its 19 organized boroughs. While referred to as the ""Unorganized Borough,"" it is not a borough itself, as it forgoes that level of government structure. It encompasses nearly half of Alaska's land area, 323,440 square miles (837,700 km2), an area larger than any other U.S. state, and larger than the land area of the smallest 16 states combined. As of the 2020 U.S. Census, it had a population of 77,157, which was 10.
 
**[City-state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City-state)** 
 
 >A city-state is an independent sovereign city which serves as the center of political, economic, and cultural life over its contiguous territory. They have existed in many parts of the world since the dawn of history, including cities such as Troy,  Rome, Athens, Sparta, Carthage, and the Italian city-states during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, such as Florence, Venice, Genoa and Milan. With the rise of nation states worldwide, only a few modern sovereign city-states exist, with some disagreement as to which qualify; Monaco, Singapore, and Vatican City are most commonly accepted as such.

I'd recommend using the search function and reading over all the previous threads and asking specific questions afterwards.  Or, include some information about yourself and your plans.

"In 2010, Pew Research estimated 84% of Earth's adult human population to be ""religiously affiliated."" If most natural disasters do NOT affect religious folks, THAT would indeed be remarkable. It's kinda hard to miss 'em.

My guess is you're responding to a comment posted to highlight how natural disasters are often accompanied by one religious zealot or other declaring the occurrence of said disaster a punishment handed down by a deity for some transgression committed by an affected group. Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson are good American examples of this. They take (took) great pleasure in lighting their flocks' fuses by asserting that an angry God ""visited his loving vengeance"" on accounta the gay abortionists or some such taught their children about nose piercing. 

Perhaps your displeasure with the comment is actually a response to this kernel of truth and not to the commenter, whom you surely (I say with 84% confidence) love as a brother or sister (or other).

"I mean it's obvious that natural disasters happen infrequently enough that people settle down in the places they happen and religious people are in the majority so of course they will be the majority of the people affected by said disasters. The irony comes when the religious threaten others with the wrath of God when they themselves will be hit by these disasters disproportionately as they are usually referring to the minorities they disagree with. 

As for moving the goalposts, I didn't realize I was in an official debate. I shifted afterwards because there was already a comment and to edit my original comment after that would not have made sense.

"KPV was the President of the School Board at the time, he never publicly gave a reason for not renewing Graff's contract other than to say that the board wanted to go in a new direction.   The board may have also violated the Open Meetings Act when they made their decision.   I worked for ASD then, and I clearly remember that the rank and file were not happy with the decision.    


I also happen to live in KPV's district, and although he's a likable person who isn't batshit crazy like the Eagle River lady, one area where he fails miserably is engaging with his constituents, he could take a lesson from Elvi Gray Jackson and John Weddleton on that front.

"Get some spring skiing in at Hilltop and maybe check out the view and trailheads at Flattop.  Get a nice steak dinner at Club Paris or a pizza at Moose's Tooth.  Next day hit the Museum and Native Heritage Center.  Have a drink and a pub meal at Humpy's, 49th State, or F St. Station.  Spend day three walking around 4th Avenue.  Probably too early for the trolley but should still be able to get a reindeer hotdog.  Check out the visitor center and the Earthquake museum/experience.  Day four is flex time to make up for anything you might have missed (it's easy to lose track of time) and any final souvenir shopping.

April is a bit early because a lot of the tourism industry is still hibernating until mid-May.  Also, April will likely be break-up season.  Spring is probably Alaska's worst season (depending on who you ask) as there are lakes everywhere.
