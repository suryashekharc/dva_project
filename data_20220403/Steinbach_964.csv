"So I had family inside the building, (my kids) and outside the building (other relatives. My kids were locked down, but seemed to take it pretty well, picking them up did not seem dangerous. I was obviously very upset that this happened and confused.

I talked to my realitive who was at the protest outside and a few things from their perspective are important.

- there was communication ahead of this event between police, school administration and some of the attending adult protestors focused on helping kids protest productively and without getting heated or violent. There are kids who are upset, and the food and the activities provided by the adults were in part an effort to keep kids busy and docile during moments of what seemed like an emotional event.
- kids didn't all walk out in proper winter gear or with all their belongings and once outside were locked out because they were protestors. When some protestors (students) tried to re-enter the building they were restrained from doing so by police.
- Despite not being able to garuntee it, my relative did not see any adults from the protest attempting to gain access to the school, and says that the mood and attitudes outside the building remained calm and civil for the most part with adults having to stop some teens from fighting, from starting a food fight, and from being disrespectful to teachers/administration. 

IMO;
I don't know what went on inside the school but  what went on outside the school seems to have been reasonably planned with maintaing the peace in mind. That said the adults present protesting are not protesting in an appropriate place. Counterpoint, if some, like my relative were planning ahead to attend to support students and prevent violence by directing their energies that puts a different light on the adult precense at the school.

Conclusion;
It's possible that just the fear of the protestors (many of which were students) outside the building caused a chain of events leading to a lock down for the safety of the kids inside the school.

EDIT: I also need to address your false equivalence of BLM at least. When BLM protested in Steinbach they got a permit from the city, handed out masks, engaged in a peaceful conversation at a park, did a walk down mainstreet and returned to the park.

I think you might be right!

"Yeah. The previous law (provincial) banned Sunday shopping but allowed for local by-laws to bypass it. Which most communities did. Steinbach city council said it’s too divisive and wouldn’t create a by-law allowing it. Then the province changed the law to opt-in, rather than opt-out. Now a municipality can ban it themselves, and no longer blame the province for it. The default is now that it’s allowed. And city council is too cowardly to create a by-law to ban it.

I’ve lived in Steinbach my whole life. I grew up Catholic but have been atheist for the last 20 years. Very rarely religion comes up in conversations with coworkers or acquaintances.

"Winkler has solidified itself as ""Manitoba's Asshole."" No if, and, or butts about it.  Steinbach came in a close second, capturing the title of ""Manitoba's Armpit.""  Everything stinks there, regardless of what you try to put on it.  Both Steinbach and Winkler have a large number of citizens that are against Covid vaccinations, following public health orders, and wearing masks in public places.  If you don't believe what I'm posting, I suggest you investigate on your own.  Start with a reddit search of Steinbach.  Second, do a search of ""The Church of God (Restoration)"" and it's halfwit pastor Tobias Tissen.  These losers constantly defy public heath orders and the law, because they feel it shouldn't apply to them.   They have been fined multiple times, well in the thousands if dollars.  In fact, it has been reported that they may be facing the maximum fine allowed for defying public health orders set at $1,000,000.  RCMP have blocked access to their own church  services in the past. It was all over the media.  It still hasn't stopped them though.  Their asshat pastor thought it was a great idea to travel to Mexico last Christmas for 2 weeks.  Do you think he quarantined when he came back?  Of course not!  RCMP gave him $17,000 in fines for that one on Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.  Pretty heavy fines for a simple Church Pastor wouldn't you think?Just add up his personal fines alone since the pandemic started.  You will realize that this would bankrupt most Canadians.  But yet, he continues.  Why is that?  Is he Scrooge McDuck?  Of course not. Scrooge McDuck is a tight wad.  Aint no way he's paying those fines.  Does he have that strong of financial support from his parishioners that they can afford all these fines, potentially a $1,000,000 one?  Where is all this money to burn coming from?  A few people with alot of money?  Many people with some money?  A combo of both?  That's something to think about too.  All those people are out of their Goddamn minds!!  So keep that in mind if your looking to attend a service on Sundays.   If you don't go to their church though, you will be a second class citizen in their eyes.  If that doesn't scare you, take a trip to Steinbach and see for yourself.  Start with Superstore.  Park by the entrance.  Do not go in!  Watch the people walk in maskless, or with their chin diapers on.  Without a care in the world.  It's eye-opening, that's for sure.  The sad part is Superstore welcomes it.
I won't go into detail, but there are more businesses in Steinbach with antivax or antimask viewpoints.  All it takes is a bit of time and some digging to find them.  Hell, The MP of Tache, Ted Falk is a national disgrace.  His constituency office is located in Steinbach. Last September,  Falk had the gall to spread false, misleading and harmful claims about covid vaccinations.  His claim was to a reporter of The Carillon, the community newspaper.  I swear I'm not making this stuff up.  His assertion was that ""you were 13 times more likely to die from the Delta variant if you were double vaccinated than if you were unvaccinated.""  Ted also asserted that public health experts regularly provide conflicting information and people need to do their own research.  This guy currently works in the House of Commons, and has been there since 2013. He's the national representative of Steinbach and the R.M. of Tache in the House of Commons.  These are his beliefs.  If he thinks that way, how many more in his riding agree with his beliefs?  He's won 4 elections in a row.  Each time by a landslide.  Not all Steinbach is bad.  There are many positives in Steinbach.  Any coworker from Steinbach I've spent time with was awesome. Some of the funniest people out there.  Do you have medical needs? If so,  it's a great town.  The hospital has been a lifesaver for my family.  All ER visits have been relatively quick compared to the city.  It also has most everyone's shopping needs all within a quick distance.  Lots of residential and commercial growth.  Alot has changed over the years.  You couldn't buy alcohol within the city limits until not long ago. The place was a ghost town come Sunday.  Everything closed.
In the end I think it's a case of a few bad apples ruining the bunch.  But these apples have a large platform to spread their views.  They speak very loudly.  Alot of what they say is dangerous.  It sets off alarm bells.
Would I move my family into Steinbach? No. Not a chance.  Please think hard over this before coming to a decision.  Your needs may be totally different than mine.  There's alot of positives, but also alot of negatives.  If it's about working in Steinbach, I would strongly consider communities around the area.  Blumenort, Lorette, Ste. Anne, Landmark are all decent options depending on your needs.

"I respectfully disagree.  The “live and let live” mentality in regards to vaccines only has validity when the virus is less transmissible and dangerous than Covid.  If not getting vaccinated for Covid were a decision that would impact only yourself, by all means, make your choice.  But people choosing to not get the Covid vaccine is the reason our numbers are through the roof. It enables the virus to spread and mutate further which detracts from the effectiveness of the vaccine and all the public health guidelines that so many of us are following.  Unfortunately, I live in Southern Health.  I have lost my mother in law to Covid as a direct result of an anti vaxx family member refusing to take Covid seriously.

"Hot take:
That whole article on SteinbachOnline was a dumpster 🔥 .  Top to bottom. 
You know, I detest these individuals who refuse to listen to logic and ignorantly put others at risk.  This jackass is a teacher.  You would think someone in the position to shape our youth would make decisions based on logic and science.  Your faith should give you moral fibre. Not blind you to rational, common sense. 
This guy should be kissing the feet (with a mask on of course) every single person who in some way or another was or is involved with his medical care.  These people are the true heroes of the story.  Let's get that straight.  They are the ones to thank and praise.  You know why your still breathing dipshit?  SCIENCE is why your alive today.
So why did you chose to refuse the vaccine? Your body, your choice? I get it.  You have the right to say no.  I'm pretty sure your God wants you to be a good person, not only to yourself, but to all your neighbours.  That means you help people just like yourself or less fortunate. Learn to rely on the intelligence of others to guide you through crisis together. Doesn't taking a vaccine fall in this category?  At the same time, isn't going to your job (and in public) full of covid the opposite of being a good person or a good neighbor?  Those kids have bright futures, they have family at home.  They have friends and loved ones that they want to see live a long healthy life.  You put every single one of them at risk of dying a brutal, horrific death - all because of stupidity and ignorance. 
Why did you say no to a vaccine?  Are you refusing because of a legitimate medical reason?  For example, are you allergic to some of it contents? 
Or are you just ""doing your own research first?"" Is your basement full of bunsen burners, test tubes, beakers, lab coats, civet cats, pangolins, bats, snakes, chickens, komodo dragons, pigs, chinese fish and mutated forms of covid?  Are you storing SARS in your wine fridge?
I'd bet this idiots argument is that God singled him out and faith healed him. That everything else is secondary in his recovery.
This fool should be thanking his God every night before bed, that we humans were smart enough to spare his life.  Thank Jesus that the scientific method helped him survive.  God is smart and benevolent, right?  God knows that we need to learn to fend for ourselves.  He blessed us with the intelligence to do so.

"You’re going to receive a lot of backlash here as most people on Reddit are mostly liberal-leaning and won’t see your need for a Godly employer. I can empathize with your need to maintain freedom. I, too, am a Christian. 

I would, however, encourage you in a couple of different things. Firstly, your need for a Godly employer. There are lots of good employers who are Christian and good employers that aren’t Christian. There are lots of bad employers that are Christian and lots of bad employers that aren’t Christian. I myself currently work for an excellent employer who is definitely secular. My previous employer was terrible and a terrible representative of Jesus. Might I suggest that where God has called you, to remain and be a light wherever you are? What if you’re the one called to be a light to a employer that doesn’t yet know Jesus?

Secondly, consider your vaccination status. I know all the arguments that people espouse against vaccinations and I am sympathetic (although I am vaccinated). Your vaccinated status doesn’t have anything to do with your faith, though. It’s just a vaccine. That’s it. Countless times through the gospels we are called to lay down our rights (not fight for them). I think about Peter cutting off an ear in the Garden of Gethsemane. He wanted his rights. What he was facing wasn’t “fair.” Jesus asked him to put down his sword. 

If you’re one of many who has recently lost your job because of your status, I am sorry. It’s rough to go unemployed. You may actually find a new employer sympathetic to your cause as there are a few around and many need employees. 

Just take a bit of time to really quiet your soul before the Lord and find out if there’s anything in you fighting for a cause that isn’t His.

At home away from the prying eyes of the nosy neighbour's gorging themselves on Papsi's and Ravels, certain high standing community members began to break tradition by listening to more modern music and even tapping their feet! An act unforgivably close to dancing! The very next day the populace began having great difficulty in commanding their horses and buggies. Driving through the town became a near impossible task.

"Hey, I’ve been biking here since I was a kid, it’s very safe for the most part, even at night. Sidewalk biking seems to be acceptable here at any age in case you don’t want to bike on the road (ex. Hespler and McKenzie) where there are cars whizzing by you, no ones going to be upset if your on the sidewalk.

Ive biked I’m the winter for many years as well, and suggest investing in some studded tires. Sometimes the sidewalks aren’t cleared so you may have to use the road.

I’m not sure about outside of town, but in town there are lots of great places to bike, ie. AD Penner Park. There are signs with a map placed around town too, pointing out some routes you could go. There’s a sign on Brandt St by the school, and one by the stoplights near Mickie D’s , and another on the path leading from the hospital into AD Penner Park. 

Be sure to check out the trail at apes hill too, it’s very nice and well maintained

"Statement regarding sign vandalism and hate speech

Trigger warning: transphobic hate speech

I’ve received messages this morning from folks in the Steinbach area who are reporting that my campaign signs have had stickers put across them. The stickers read “broken t[censored]”. The fact that someone had these stickers printed suggests that this is an organized, targeted effort. First, they removed nearly all my signs in the entire riding. Now that my campaign has replaced many signs, someone has had these stickers printed and is putting them on.

I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming support I’ve already received today with regard to this issue. For those who are seeing these stickers and want to know what to do, please just make a note of the location and message my campaign but do not touch the signs for now. ***Law enforcement has asked us NOT to touch the signs until they have had a chance to investigate.***

It is illegal to tamper with a political sign. The message on the sticker is also a hate crime.

To all the people who are part of or connected to the LGBTQ2S community in some way: we know we are not broken. We know we don’t need “conversion therapy”. We are beautiful, proud, and diverse. We make incredible contributions to our communities every day across the country. Some day, Canada will elect our first openly transgender or non-binary Member of Parliament. It might not be me, and it might not be in Provencher, but this is Canada and it’s 2021. It will happen soon. 

To the constituents of Provencher: I want you to know that there is a lot more to my candidacy than my gender identity. I have been very involved in a successful grassroots diabetes advocacy campaign during the past year. I am a professional musician, having performed as a full-time violinist with the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra for four years. I run a small hobby farm which includes Ojibwe Horses, a critically rare breed that is Canada's only Indigenous-developed horse breed. Being a caretaker for Ojibwe Horses – and connecting Indigenous and non-Indigenous breeders – is part of my personal work on reconciliation. I led a major research study funded by the CIHR about the experiences of transgender people with building their families, which helped to fill a significant gap in the academic literature. I am a parent of two, including one child who has a medical condition that puts him at higher risk of developing serious complications from Covid if he were to catch it. I’m proud to be fully vaccinated against Covid to help protect myself, my community, and our health system. I’m passionate about addressing climate change and protecting our environment. 

I also want you all to know that my experience at the doors during this campaign has been generally positive so far. I believe that the vast majority of people in our communities are caring, kind and tolerant. I know we may not always agree politically, but I think (hope) we can agree that hate speech is not okay. 

Please stand with me.

To the other candidates in Provencher: Please stand with me against hate speech and ask your supporters to do the same.",t2_hozgq,nurdlette,0,1631222964.0,0,t1_hc8d10x,hc8d10x,True,nurdlette,t3_pl72we,https://www.reddit.com/r/steinbach/comments/pl72we/trevor_kirczenow_statement_regarding_sign/,Trevor Kirczenow - Statement regarding sign vandalism and hate speech,/r/steinbach/comments/pl72we/trevor_kirczenow_statement_regarding_sign/hc8d10x/,10,r/steinbach,1,10

"I'm not a cyclist myself anymore but as a driver who frequents Steinbach daily, I haven't heard of any incidents involving cyclists at least in the few years I've been around the area. In town there's a lot of designated cycling markers on the road. A lot of people ride on the sidewalk as well depending on how safe you feel I guess and I don't know how often police ticket that kind of stuff here. Seen my fair share of 10 speeders on the highways individually or in groups. Drivers here are probably some of the most cautious I have seen when it comes to cyclists and pedestrians. People are not as much in a rush as city folk. 

Just stick to the general cycling and road rules and you should be fine. Hope this helps

Ps. Used to be an avid dirt jumper in Winnipeg and a lot of the parks including Whittier park, but never made my way out to Steinbach when I was cycling. There should be some good bike paths around town just got to ride!

Attention, Ted Falk: the new directive from your Conservative Party is that you must either be vaccinated or take daily rapid Covid tests while campaigning. Will you tell us if you're taking those tests or not, since you won't confirm if you've been vaccinated? The directive also states that unvaccinated volunteers or campaign staff should not go door knocking. 

I'd appreciate knowing your vaccine status or that you're taking daily Covid tests before I agree to debate with you in person, indoors, for two hours. I've got two kids at home who are too young to be vaccinated, including one who lives with type one diabetes, which puts him at higher risk of serious complications if he were to catch Covid.

Recognizing that the MP of this region is a leader and has the ability to sway people with their disclosure and opinion is a good thing and I would hope that our MP would get vaccinated, and if they have been, then disclose it so that more people who have faith in our leaders would also follow suit.

"Fecking terrified due to the low vaccine uptake here. My church lost nearly a dozen members in a week due to COVID back in the fall and thank God every day my grandparents were able to avoid catching it (Bread and Butter had an outbreak that claimed too many of our family friends' lives). My family and I are double dosed, but pops works with vulnerable and immunocompromised children, my bestie's sibling can't get vaccinated due to legitimate medical concerns, and we have ""plandemic"" conspirators surrounding us at work and within the extended family. I already had nightmares last night about be accosted by covidiots about my choice to continue to wear my mask.

"I've read articles quoting doctors who say these new health orders are a bad idea.  

- 20% of Manitobans over twelve are not vaccinated. About 230,000 people.
   - Steinbach is in even worse shape. Of the 16000 residents, 40% have not received a vaccine. 6400 people, not counting the surrounding RMs.
- The government has not released any modelling for a delta driven fourth wave.
- Mask mandates have little to no downside. You could wear a mask even outside a pandemic with no negative side effects.
- Getting people to stop wearing masks is a lot easier than telling them to put them back on.

We are in a really good position right now that has us seeing near single digit new daily cases, but as we saw at the beginning of the third wave that can turn sour in an instant.

"I've been following this since the beginning and believe I can offer some valid information. However, this issue is complex and there has been a lot going on. I mean, a lot. I'm going to try to give a brief outline of the issues. 

Southland church claimed that their lead pastor was teaching contrary to Southland belief statements. There were three points mentioned in the mediation report that was livestreamed at the end of 2020 (I took notes but I do not believe the video is available any longer). 

1. Diminishment of the role of personal devotions
2. Marriage and divorce
3. Doctrine of hell and eternal punishment VS annihilation

There was also contention regarding the Church Renewal program and its place within the church. Southland's position being that Church Renewal is sort of an umbrella program held above all churches affiliated with it, the lead pastor's view that its an aid to the church. In conjunction with this issue is contention regarding the role of listening prayer, Southland as a huge advocate of its importance. 

Some personal observations: I think a good way to discern the differences in belief between Southland Church and Crossview Church (the new Church headed by the lead pastor) is to read their statements of faith. 
https://mysouthland.com/beliefs
https://crossview.church/our-beliefs-1#:~:text=We%20confess%20the%20historic%20faith,%2C%20doctrine%2C%20and%20conduct.%22

I also think this boils down to Southland advocating for a more emotional faith while their (ex) lead pastor advocates for a logical/rational approach to faith.

"Oh trust me you couldn't be further from the truth of me working or being affiliated with the church. At one time probably about 10 years ago I considered attending on a regular basis but did really not agree with a lot of the things I was hearing going on. I have actually held the church more towards cult status as opposed to a church very similar to the way I do springs In Winnipeg. 

As for the account it is and old account that I had deactivated a while back when I left Reddit for a while and then just came back recently. 

I can definitely appreciate people being upset that the church has appeared to be speaking for God and even being upset about them making demands of god which is one of the reasons I decided not to attend after attending some services and cell groups.

What you just provided was more of what I was looking for as a description however it is still kinda vague.

"You obviously work for the church or are affiliated with them. One day old throw away account. It was not that simple. 

The church abused their power and controlled a narrative that pretended to be speaking on God's behalf. The story of manipulation, gaslighting, abuse needs to be told. The board of directors and leaders removed the key leader who was trying to undo abuses of the past. The board of directors and leaders DEMANDED that people pick sides and fired staff who fell on the wrong side. If they weren't fired they were forced to resign. People don't risk their careers for nothing. Last month the memberships of all people were cancelled in a two week span in hopes that people wouldn't pay attention and then they did a new membership reaffirmation so that the board couldn't be voted out. The problem is that people are too scared because of how much power Southland has. 3/7 city councillors go there including the mayor, the MLA goes there, the MP attends the marketplace leaders cell, the marketplace leaders cell has probably 200-300 business leaders that won't hesitate to fire you on the spot if you speak out against the church. It's like the Holy Romain Empire in Steinbach all over again. The church leaders have admitted zero wrong doing except using too much passion.

"Except that video lacks any and all context. 

First of all, their map is wrong, they don't enter on the left side of the building (based on their overhead map). They enter in the general entrance on the bottom right.

Second, this doesn't disprove that [patients are being triaged in their cars in the parking lot](https://steinbachonline.com/local/if-i-visit-the-emergency-room-with-covid-19-what-will-happen). It's possible that the hospital has chosen to keep the waiting room as empty as possible to help with people who are dropped off or walk-in and don't have a vehicle to wait in.

Third, this says nothing about hospital bed usage as the person filming this isn't checking that out at all.

Fourth, it could also be proof that people listened to the plea's from healthcare providers and are staying home for non urgent issues.

Filming a video from the non emergency entrance and walking through the hospital to prove there's an agenda can be very misleading - especially when it's missing facts. People need to start thinking critically and realizing how conspiracies are started and put together. COVID-19 is not a conspiracy, and the data is showing very concerning trends.

Their camera work was terrible - their video would have had more credibility if they showed a single bit of hospital signage clearly, but it's all there.

That being said are Covid patients being tested in triaged in another area of the hospital property?

Someone posted the full video on YouTube with a link to the overhard map of the hospital. Based on seeing the full video and the map, I think it actually lines up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiLivgrngpE&feature=youtu.be
