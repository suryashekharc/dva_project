"My biggest problem with background checks is giving my information. Any disgruntled minimum wage assistant can (and will, if they have a brain) sell all your info on the dark web for $1-2 a pop.

I'd NEVER agree to a background check unless I pay for it myself and only give them the results.

But in the bigger scheme of things, as both a landlord and a tenant, I wish they got rid of all of these bullshit laws in the US that make it so hard to rent; leases and all of that crap. Super easy in my country; you have deposit and first months rent? Welcome. Have money by the 27th? Stay the next month. Don't have it? 3 day grace period then all your shit is outside & locks changed. No one is locked into any bullshit fucking contacts or leases or background or credit checks. Thankfully they don't ask for your stool color or period volume (yet).

Why the hell do I need all that to have a place to live? In what world does any of that make sense? I have money and am looking for a place, you have a place and want money. That's it!! Wtf is all of that additional bullshit around it??

"I grew up in the Shawangunks/Catskills, a pretty outdoorsy childhood. Left for work and  mostly school for about 7 years, floated around the southeast and midwest during that time.

Really missed the northeast badly and hated the heat + crowds. Got married to my highschool sweetheart, he got a job in IT in the area, so we bought a little house that had been abandoned for three years. Under listing price and in the 200s. New England wasn't intentional- he was going to take the first reasonable offer that hired him. But we were overjoyed to be headed back to the northeast.

I got a job baking bread full time. Despite the IT position, we still only make 5 figures between the two of us. We're quiet, try to vote in the interests of the community and schools, and help out our neighbors where we can. We also try to buy as much from Maine vendors as we can, since I know it's a struggle out here. I wouldn't say we have ""NY"" values, since it's a gigantic state with a ton of different views and regions. Most people just think of NYC, and that's not us. We just try to live by what takes care of the needs of the people around us. 

My home state/community is also seeing a huge influx of transplants, but I think literally everywhere across the country is. I was just back for a surprise party for my grandmother's birthday, and despite the newcomers, the area is still its lovely, kooky, Hudson Valley-esque self. Sure, some businesses have closed and new ones have opened, but it's always been that way, and the mainstays are still going strong.

There was a period in my life where we had to move around a lot for my dad's job, and everywhere we moved people blamed out of staters for all the problems. While I'm certain that's some of it, a lot of the problems I've seen everywhere I've lived have been brewing for decades. Deferred maintenance by the government with bandaid solutions, so to speak.

Sometimes the suspicion/coldness can feel a little alienating, but I figure with time people will hopefully come around to and see we're just trying to get by like everyone else, and are willing to contribute to the community.

"Took a glance at that article and already spotted several errors including the fact that it thinks a reactor site has its own enrichment location on site as well as ore processing. That's flat out incorrect. There are only a few enrichment facilities on the planet. It is not at every nuclear plant and is usually at a completely separate and heavily guarded location.

This also looks like it was before china announced it's construction of an additional 150 plants, India building more plants (both uranium and thorium based).

It's claims about needing exotic materials is also incorrect. 90+% of a reactor is concrete and steel. After that it's lead to create a nigh indestructible lead infused concrete shell around the reactor to make sure no radiation can ever get out. For a similar power output with wind and solar you need significantly more (10 to 100x more) REEs and exotic materials for the various components. Including the ones mentioned by the author as well as others such as vanadium. A nuclear reactor is just a steam turbine that heats water with nuclear fission. It's one of the simplest and direct forms of energy conversion there is.

I'll continue to read the article and update this comment but it's very clearly incorrect. Especially when it's saying an 8 square mile zone needed is a size concern for its power output when for a similar amount of power from solar or wind would reactor at least 30+ square miles of land.

Update: it's wrong about the disposal methods for radioactive waste. There are two very viable and safe methods. One is repurposing the waste to be reused in burner and breeder reactors and the other is to bury about multiple miles underground with the same tech we use for oil drilling to deploy it so far down it won't be affected by earthquakes or tectonic shifts. Both of these would work without issue.

It's also wrong about needing to fully decommission a plant rather than update its infrastructure and repairing it which is significantly cheaper and extends the longevity of the plant. The fact it's built mainly with steel and concrete further cements this fact.

Update 2: I also noticed that the author is ignoring the fact more people have died from wind and solar generation than those have from nuclear.

His statement on Fukushima not being predictable is extremely false. The issues with Fukushima were well known and well documented at least a decade before the incident and brought up to the Japanese government and the company in charge who did nothing to resolve the issue.

The author again completely ignores the reality of nuclear breeders or the use of thorium reactors.",t2_zs95a,Rippedyanu1,0,1649003215.0,0,t1_i38md7y,i38md7y,False,Windowwaker1138,t3_tv8945,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tv8945/lovell_solar_farm_is_off_the_table/,Lovell solar farm is off the table?,/r/Maine/comments/tv8945/lovell_solar_farm_is_off_the_table/i38md7y/,5,r/Maine,0,5

Just based on my experiences here in western Maine, coyote are as big as a small German shepherd though I've seen some as big or bigger than a GSD. The ones I've seen out west, including Arizona, are more the size of a large fox but skinny. Your springer is likely bigger than most if not all coyote out there. Your GSD could eat one for breakfast. Cats, as you know, are coyote snacks no matter where you are. A lifetime ago I used to go on extended climbing trips around the west with my cat and spent a lot of time in Arizona in a tent. I trained my cat to come whenever a coyote howled.

"Germany is not screwed because of Russia (we’ll they are but that’s not what this is about). The proportion of natural gas they use is ridiculous because you need base load in addition to solar, because solar and wind are never going to be base load generators. Base load generators: Hydro, nuclear, oil, natural gas. What saltysimp is saying is that because they didn’t focus on diversifying their base load generators (like France did with nuclear) they have a higher reliance on natural gas. 

The point is we can’t do everything all at once. It would behoove us to focus a bit more on expanding those energy sources that decrease our reliance on current base load generators (natural gas and petroleum) to incorporate hydro and nuclear. We can work on solar as well but we’ve got to make a more concerted effort to bring nuclear and hydro online.

Nothing if that's your thing.  But then don't move to place where the grocery store is more than 15 minutes away and then bitch about it and call the locals who are fine with it hicks that can't tolerate change when they balk at urbanizing their town.

In my area, there are 3 large grocery stores within 20 minutes of me.  There is shopping for about anything you'd need in 3 urban areas within 30 minutes.

"I'm guessing you are speaking of salmon here which has a wide range of coloration to their flesh from the dark red of sockeyes to lighter colors of chinooks. 

This color is from the diet they eat, much like how flamingos have their distinct pink color due to their diet, from many small crustaceans or other fish that have consumed crustaceans. Commercial salmon producers supplement the diet of farmed salmon with carotenoids, the trademarked Carophyll or other products containing astaxanthin, a food additive that will cause the flesh of farmed fish to be a deeper (and more marketable) pink, but astaxanthin is also an essential nutrient for the fish that acts as a provitamin for vitamin A. This compound can be derived from natural sources like algae and krill, or synthetic sources.

While the FDA requires that salmon fed with feeds containing astaxanthin be labeled. The ""color added"" labeling encountered at the grocery store may make it sound as if the flesh was injected or soaked in a dye after the fish was processed, but this is not the case. The carotenoid compound is metabolized by the fish when it is alive, just as it is in wild salmon. It should be noted that the European Food Safety Authority says the use of astaxanthin up to the maximum permitted dietary level for salmon and trout is of no concern for the safety of the consumer.",t2_41nya,SuperBry,0,1648996537.0,0,t1_i386x37,i386x37,False,Shake-Spear4666,t3_tufilo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tufilo/work_to_begin_on_maine_salmon_farm_on_old_paper/,Work to begin on Maine salmon farm on old paper mill site,/r/Maine/comments/tufilo/work_to_begin_on_maine_salmon_farm_on_old_paper/i386x37/,1,r/Maine,0,1

"Germany, which is significantly higher latitude and therefore has less “solar gain,” gets more than 10% of their annual electricity (and more than 50% on hot summer days when demand is highest, meaning without solar they’d be running their dirtiest and most expensive coal plants). Maine’s more comparable to southern France. 

Also, it’s true the grid wasn’t built to handle lots of solar, but it also wasn’t built to handle electric vehicles and all the modern electric conveniences people want and need. The grid needs to be upgraded, and it’s well established that adding distributed generation like solar helps achieve that upgrade at an overall lower cost. 

Interestingly, offshore wind is a key part of the picture too — it’s a “both and,” not “either one” situation.

"This is a common perception of northern people by people from away. On the other side, we can’t wait for southerners to finish their sentence and/or step aside. It’s a different lifestyle and priority set. 

Example: My spouse is from Texas, we’ve been many times, we’re relocating there soon. I struggle to fit in with my peers in Texas. 

Women in New England aren’t known for their hair, or style, or manners, they’re “graded,” and praised differently. I’m not used to anyone caring or commenting on what I wear to get groceries, because no one here cares. We have other priorities, none of them are social. The same for men. 

It’s partially due to our communities: they’re smaller and more spread out, our weather conditions are harsher, so there’s more “to do,” we winterize our homes, we wake three hours before work to clear our driveways, we drive more than an hour to work and it’s NOT due to traffic, it’s due to distance. Beyond that, you have more aggressive industries (fishing, agriculture, logging, millwork, etc). All of this is changing, but not as quickly as more populated areas in the nation. 

It’s not personal, we just only have 8 hours of daylight for four months of the year, haha.

"Shut off TV, limit and rig your social media algorithms and intake to be shit you care about not whatever else these platforms are feeding people unable to think for themselves. Get involved in local communities, get to know the people around you you depend on for food services etc. Get involved in something local you can get behind and work on defining the landscape around you thru your eyes and experiences.  

I feel there is much going on not being said, just done, tensions are high people are scared and uneasy and for many it feels wrong and hopeless but they can't seem to see why or believe they have any ability to.advocate for more meaningful life. The current systems are breaking because the disparity that happens when economics are weaponized against working class populations.

The way of life in Maine is more independent and open to equitable exchanges more so than many other areas in the country. We don't have the blatant crime other places do, but never let that fool you our state like all others is run by hidden legit and criminal factions that keep order. Some people I feel are relocating for safety from city life others may feel us country bumpkins are easy pickings. Big picture stuff feels really off and apon closer scrutiny I get why so many are so uneasy. Who cares where the transplants are coming from, do they add value to the communities they relocated to or not? In some areas its a good thing, new money, new opportunity for community growth development and sustainability, I feel that's overall a good thing. There are also plenty buying up properties trying force the locals out of fleece em for shit, that's not so cool. 

Complicated times where it pays to just chill and focus on the small things, be open.and respectful to positive change and opportunities for more independent sustainable communities. 

Best wishes to anyone struggling with fear, worry confusion when attempting to navigate the ever evolving social landscape we all co exist within.

"You're exactly right. It is also perplexing to me the amount of rentals in the cities! We are closing on a house and spend time in both Waterville and Augusta, it absolutely amazes me the amount of homes that are multi-family! It feels like every house over 2k SQ. ft. in the city is a multiple family home. We saw a stat that like .2% of the homes in the zip code we bought were built since 2010. 

I think that's more of a factor in the housing pinch than outsiders. 

Multi-family homes require 15-25% down payment, single family only need 5% or 0% down in some cases (yes, I know with PMI) so people paying 20-30K over asking on a single family home is still better than forking over 50k or more in down payment on a multi.

"So ... I'm one of them. I'm currently in a motel in Vermont resting for my last leg of the journey.  It will appear that I'm moving from California, but I was only back there for a year. Been in Austin for a decade and several other states before that.  I want to settle somewhere that the general public isn't as jaded and angry as the SF Bay Area. I was raised there, and didn't see it until I left and came back a couple of times.

My son went to a bushcraft camp up there and fell in love with it.  He loves it so much that he encouraged his sister and her husband to join him. That was two years ago.  They are settled, but my son went back to Austin.  

I'm not bringing California money or ideas up there. I may miss some of the cultural and ethnic foods that are so common, but I know to expect Hannaford's and WalMart for my staples. I'm familiar with real winters, however, not as cold or long as up in the county.  

I've asked a few questions here in this sub, and have done some of my own research. I plan on getting whatever job, and being part of the community. Ever since leaving Cali, I realized that I prefer a quieter, small town lifestyle. That's what I'm looking for.

I have also been here all my life, short of college. I’m about 5 years into my career and I’m ready to own a home. Just bummed that when I could buy finally, it became difficult and more costly.

">more people in to have more tax dollars 

That not reality and it baffles me that so many people seem to believe it.  More development costs more in taxes than the new revenue they bring in.  Especially when it's mostly residential.  But can be the same depending on the commercial development.  

Let's say the local school costs about $10k per student (this seems to be an average in my surrounding area).  You build 3 houses that have 2 kids each.  Those 6 kids aren't really going to cause any need for a new school or new staff.  So their revenue - averaging about $5k per house is new revenue for the schools and town.

But you build 50 new houses that average 2 kids each and the schools and town have lost money.  Now you need more staff and maybe a bigger school.  In my area, it's more like 200 new houses a year.  There's only a small area for public water and no public sewer, so we're packing dozens of houses on top of each other  with wells and septic tanks very close.  More and more people are having issues with dry wells.

Can you imagine the cost and tax hike when public water needs to be expanded and a public sewer system needs to be added?   And who's paying for that?  Sure as hell not just the developers or just the newer people in town who make it necessary.

My taxes have almost doubled in less than 5 years.

"""We need growth!"" is a fallacy.  Towns don't become dead or dying because transplants aren't welcomed or because they don't build 10 new subdivisions (or more) every year.  Those that die or just lose the majority of young people, do so because of economic reasons - like mills closing or other jobs sent over seas.

And that's generally in places that are too far away from an urban area large enough to support the surrounding communities.  

Population growth on a more normal pace isn't usually bad and is the ""normal"" growth you're talking about.  But an explosion of growth in a  short time frame, especially growth that wasn't planned well, is another matter.  Especially for smaller towns that have been small for several generations.

">If a couple dozen folks moving into your community of thousands 

If it were 24 people into populations of 10s of thousands, sure, I'd agree.  But it's dozens of houses each year going into populations of less than 10 thousand.  

And I might not even mind that so much if they didn't decide they were bored and keep working (and voting) to get starbucks et al closer to them.  Heaven forbid they should have to drive more than 15 minutes for something.  

And since a lot of them come ""for the schools"" - they only plan on being here for a limited time so have zero interest in the long term health of the community.  All they want is to get more conveniences and bankrupt the towns (and lower income tax payers) to pay for every latest bell and whistle for the schools.  ""Why shouldn't a town with 5,000 people have a turf field?  The next town over has one, we want one, too!""

The problem is the attitude:  ""Look at this lovely small town!  I want to raise my children here, especially since the schools are highly rated."" Then shortly after... ""Wow, this is kind of boring, there's no night life here on the weekends and I have to go so far for take out and fancy coffee!""  and... ""Gee we don't have a problem paying for the high taxes for the schools, so what are those old people whining about?""

And the most favorite... ""Stop whining about us turning your small town into a sleeper suburb of Portland, change is inevitable, just deal with it!""  And then get butt hurt because they don't feel welcome by people complaining about yet more development and higher taxes and the inability of people who actually work in Maine, at their local starbucks or at the schools, to buy a house on the town's social media.",t2_5486h,indi50,1,1648938946.0,0,t1_i35rjsr,i35rjsr,False,PelvisPresley208,t3_tumz2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tumz2z/influx_of_transplants/,Influx of transplants,/r/Maine/comments/tumz2z/influx_of_transplants/i35rjsr/,7,r/Maine,0,7

"Transplant from Oregon. I loved it there - but um, it's kind of on fire. I pride myself on being a good neighbor and I've had nothing but good experiences with the people I have met. I am originally from the East Coast anyway, so I have a some idea of the culture. I work remotely but I try super hard to support local businesses and not be a dick.

Where I lived before I bought a crappy house and made t into something nice through my blood sweat and tears. I wanted to live there forever, but the city commissioners decided it was OK for people to live on the streets. They set things on fire, left their excrement everywhere and lived in tents on the sidewalks my tax dollars paid for. I went to the local grocery store to go shopping and I came outside to an active shooter situation. I could go on, but you get the picture.

Just now I am at the point in my life where I can make real money, but it’s too late.

I am getting pushed out of my home town by out of staters with more money and less manners. The sense of entitlement in these people is depressing. They’re taking the bad qualities of their home states with them and ruining the humble and quaint living I have experienced my entire life. 

My favorite hiking and camping spots are being trashed by people who don’t give a shit. There is no regard for nature from these people. They want to take their cute pictures and look at loons while they leave their la croix cans all over the campsites.

"The Wabanaki are peoples with their own languages, stories, cultural practices, and connection to the land. The State of Maine has been allowed to treat them differently than every other federally-recognized tribe in the country due to the fucked up results of a settlement in 1980 where the tribes gave up a very strong land claim in exchange for some cash. In the implementation of that settlement, the State law made it so that tribes would be treated like towns under its jurisdiction instead of as sovereign governments (the way every other tribe is supposed to be treated). This current push is to undo that oppressive relationship, so that they can benefit from federal legislation and funding, including the ability to engage in needed infrastructure like ensuring clean drinking water at Sipayik, which the State of Maine is blocking.

"I’m certainly not saying that Ukraine is s neo-Nazi regime. But ethno-nationalist? Absolutely they are. Before the war broke out they were passing legislation to mandate teaching schools in the Ukrainian language and using it as the sole language of government. These are clearly ethno-nationalist issues.

Azov is only one of the neo-Nazi terror groups that has been embraced by Ukraine. There are others, most notably Right Sector. These groups have been carrying out terrorist attacks in Donbass for years.

The Ukrainian government is not neo-Nazi, they are a liberal capitalist plutocracy just like the USA, or Russia, or most other governments in the world in 2022. While not neo-Nazi in and of itself, it has enabled these neo-Nazi organizations to terrorize the eastern half of their country for years. Perhaps the government simply doesn’t feel that it has the power to stop them, or perhaps it saw them as useful pawns in their great game of geopolitical brinksmanship.

It’s worth noting of course, that Russia, also a liberal capitalist plutocracy, has also encouraged neo-Nazi paramilitaries in the Ukraine and elsewhere. Their hands are certainly no cleaner in that respect than Ukraine’s.

Yes, Russia invaded. They want to replace the American, European and Ukrainian oligarchs who currently rule Ukraine with oligarchs loyal to Putin. It was wrong of them to invade, but it’s just as wrong of the wealthy elites who rule Ukraine to throw their working class population away as cannon fodder to protect their own interests. And it’s equally wrong for the oligarchs who rule the US and EU to flood the region with weapons, adding fuel to the fire and inevitably increasing the number of working class people who will die for nothing in this power struggle between elites. Not to mention threatening all of our lives with the possibility of nuclear escalation.

I support the Ukrainian people whole heartedly. They are the biggest victims here. I also support the Russian people who are experiencing grievous losses too. But I do not support this stupid fucking war. Yes, Putin started it, but who started it is a less important question right now than who will end it - and Zelensky could end it with the stroke of a pen just as easily as Putin could, if they were not both blinded to the suffering of their people by their own class interests.",t2_h0ql0emd,sy33d_am33r_ali,0,1648913919.0,0,t1_i349nqt,i349nqt,False,Candygramformrmongo,t3_tt0kb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maine/comments/tt0kb7/portland_ukraine_protestsvigils/,Portland Ukraine Protests/vigils.,/r/Maine/comments/tt0kb7/portland_ukraine_protestsvigils/i349nqt/,0,r/Maine,0,0

"But they *are*. Independents exist only as a label, not a voting bloc, and labels are meaningless in elections. It does not matter what box someone checks when they register to vote -- it matters if and how they actually vote in elections. Polling, research groups like Pew, and major academic studies of voters all show that the overwhelming number of independent voters vote for the same party every election. That is to say that Joe Schmoe checked the indy box because it's cool -- literally, one of the most common reasons given for checking ""independent"" is that people [think it looks better](https://psmag.com/news/independents-hipsters-american-politics-72938) \-- but is voting Republican every two to four years. His ""independence"" exists only on paper. He is a Republican in all but name.

What I am saying here is neither new nor controversial thinking. These facts were a core part of Karl Rove's ""base first"" strategy that led George Bush to the White House in 2000 and 2004. Rove has talked about this frequently and these facts have been part of mainstream political discourse for [quite some time](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/11/06/independents-didnt-decide-the-midterm-election/) now.

"No, Ukraine is not an ethno-nationalist regime.

If you're referring to the Azov Battalion, you may want to read this: [https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/03/02/what-is-ukraines-azov-battalion/](https://www.snopes.com/news/2022/03/02/what-is-ukraines-azov-battalion/)

The Azov Battalion *is* an extremist group, yes. And yes, they are currently fighting in the Ukrainian military, but so is everyone else in Ukraine. But they are not the ones setting policy in Ukraine or for the Ukrainian government. Zelensky is a centrist, not a member of the far right, and he's also Jewish. 

Speaking of Zelensky, maybe you thought he wore a Nazi symbol? Nope, that's not true either: [https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/zelenskyy-nazi-iron-cross/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/zelenskyy-nazi-iron-cross/) 

I mean, I'm not denying neo-nazis *exist* in Ukraine. But they *exist* in most countries in the world. But is Ukaraine a neo-nazi regime? Hell no!

And also, I'm gonna fall back on this as well: Russia is the invader. They had no legitimate reason to invade. Ukraine has a right to self-determination the same as any other country.

"I've done it twice, both times going to the Tampa area.  

First time I basically stuck to 95 the whole way. I wouldn't recommend this as you are going straight through the center of the metropolis. It starts to suck in Massachusetts and doesn't stop sucking until you get to Virginia. I timed it pretty well so that I was going through this area in the middle of the night, and it still sucked anyway. Boston, Providence, New Haven, New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington... it all sucks ass.  

The second time I made a pit stop at my friends' place in western New Hampshire and I took a more scenic, inland route. I wanted to go around Virginia (long story) so I had to cut west a little ways before heading south. I took a couple state routes (202/9/7) through NH and VT until I got on I90 near Albany. Rode that west along the coast of Lake Erie until I hit Cleveland. Took the 271 to the 71 through Columbus and into Cincinnati. Then I got on the 75 which took me all the way from Cincinnati to Tampa.  

That route is definitely further out of the way than you need to go, but I would really recommend doing something similar to avoid the coastal 95 route.

"from a non vet but working in healthcare POV, if you're not close to Togus in a Augusta (centralish Maine) they would send referrals to any specialty office you need. I work in ophthalmology and we personally try to get our vet referrals in quickly, I am not sure how other offices do it. some of our offices have a 6+mo waiting list. dermatology has a year waiting list. I think each specialty med office within the VA has their own employees doing referrals, so it'd be specific people each time you needed say an appt for a new orthopedic problem. so that's nice to have some continuity at least.
