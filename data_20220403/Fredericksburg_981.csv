"That podcast, along with the Gangster Capitalism season about Liberty (which is where many of the executive staff went to school), opened my eyes as well. I also binged the hillsong documentary, and there was so much in there that rocked me to the core. The young woman at the end with glasses' words could have been my own. There was even some brief video from lifepoint of Carl Lentz preaching. I don't know if you recall the, ""fully alive"" show that Pastor Daniel had locally, but he had announced from the platform that it was going to be on the hillsong channel (don't think it is anymore or how long that lasted). There is a connection between lifepoint and hillsong, but I'm not sure how much. I know on worship probably 75% of our worship songs were from hillsong. The model with using the college for free labor is spot on, as well. There was a woman at the end of the hillsong doc that issued a warning that hillsong might not exist as hillsong anymore but it will continue to exist. The same culture exists at LC.

"We were around in the earlier years only 2,3 campuses.   We left because of how the “speaker” (they call him Pastor) defined discipleship.

"It was already relatively loosely enforced, even by VA cop standards. I'm sure things get worse once you get into actual NOVA, I wouldn't know.

From my understanding, experience, and conversations with multiple tint people, a lot of people just get 35 all around, despite being darker than the limit for the front.

Lastly, and most importantly, with the new law on ""incidentals,"" you can not be pulled over for it in VA, period. You can technically get nicked if you get pulled for something else, but I haven't been pulled over recently nor talked to people to see how this has affected the policing culture. Hopefully, theoretically police will start to care about things like this less and only worry about the actual moving violations, but maybe this law has made them *more* picky about things once you get pulled, I'm not sure.

*Actually* lastly, if you're getting it done around here, definitely go with Auto Restyling Solutions downtown. Dude's the greatest.

EDIT: I have also seen maaaaany people running 20 all around or darker and have wondered. Most non-moving violations in VA are a 40-60 dollar ticket, from what I've seen (plus the ghastly court fees), if you choose to peel it and actually go to court, they'd remove the fine (but you still have to pay the court fees, of course...), but I'm not sure about secondary offenses or if they increase. If not, many people probably just risk it. A *chance* of a 100 dollar fine once every couple/few years is a calculated cost.

To compare, I've run without a front license plate for over a decade. Got pulled for it once years ago, 45 bucks, I think. And even in the half dozen or more times I've gotten pulled over since then, it's never been tacked on. So I'm figuring tinting is like no front plates - really not much of an issue unless the cop is particularly picky or low on their number or whatever, haha.",t2_5kiq4,1337haXXor,0,1648226567.0,0,t1_i23246l,i23246l,True,lost_smore,t3_tnpgls,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericksburg/comments/tnpgls/tinted_car_windows/,Tinted Car Windows,/r/fredericksburg/comments/tnpgls/tinted_car_windows/i23246l/,3,r/fredericksburg,0,3

"Currently serving on the worship team, but plotting my escape. I've been involved in many large churches, and they all have their issues, but Lifepoint has a REALLY unhealthy culture of constant asks, and the second you decline serving at an event, you're yesterday's news. I watched it happen to someone who left shortly after I joined,, and I've seen it play out twice since then.. The church is pretty open about the fact that it runs a minimalist staff, which seems like good stewardship on the surface, but that has created a culture of reliance upon volunteers to fill most of the positions needed on a Sunday. My wife volunteers in the kid's ministry, and she's constantly having to stay late because there aren't enough people to man the childcare rooms. It also results in an over-worked staff. There's one particular staff member (well, former staff member at this point) that was so overworked to the point that I legitimately felt awful for them, and I'm fairly sure this caused some actual physical harm to them.   


I'm not sure who you are, but I could probably make some guesses.  If you'd like to reach out to me via PM and talk, I've built some pretty strong relationships with a few of the staff members, and I'm planning to use those relationships to have a heart-to-heart conversation about how they could make their volunteer environments less toxic.

"Spoiler alert: When I went through Freedom, at the conference at the end (which is kept very secretive about what happens at conference... My leaders said it was better than Disneyland), there is a point where you write down all your sexual partners names over the years and you destroy it at the foot of the cross. It's a bit cathartic, but you are encouraged to include any homosexual sexual partners and then you get prayer for what you are struggling with in regards to sexual sin.

"Worst type of people that exist. My parents stopped going when the found out the ""kingdom builders"" program has incentives for the more money you give to the church. Levels of membership to where if you give more than x amount of money you get to stay in close quarters with the pastor on missionary trips, and pressured people to cash in bonds and dip into savings/retirement. I started going 2009ish when they were out of Chancellor middle school and saw a lot of good people leave fast. A lot of people including myself drank the kool aid of the sex appeal of a small time congregation build into a mega church. No longer religious but have been to some small methodist services with friends/family during the holidays and they value you much more as a human and dont try to cater to first time guests every time you walk in.

"Hey! I used to do DoorDash and UberEats around FXBG for a bit while I was in school. Now, I must preface this by saying that it’s been about 6 months since I’ve done it; but here are some things I’d tell people like you:

1) Driving on weekends tends to earn you more money than weekdays. Especially during dinners hours. A little secret I learned as well is that people often order during the middle of the night on weekends, and given that most dashers don’t dash that late, you can expect a pretty decent workload if you work late into the nights on weekends.

2) pay varies a lot; weekdays I averaged around $16/hr and weekends was about $21/hr. But again, that varies.

3) Keep in mind that you will be needing to pay for gas. Given gas prices currently, this will severely impact the amount you’ll pull in. If your car has low MPG, then double this point

4) Easiest job I have done in my life. If that is a factor in deciding if you want to do it, note that. Seriously, it’s ridiculous how easy and non-stressful it is. Just drive to a store, pick up food, and drop it off. There are occasionally moments where an order is messed up or you can’t find a house… but those aren’t common enough to worsen the job in its entirety IMO.

5) They don’t take taxes out of what you earn so expect having to pay the IRS during tax season. Some people don’t expect this and it screws them

6) Don’t opt-in to the black card/red card. That’s essentially a debit card they give you so that you can place orders at restaurants and pay with the card. DON’T do that if you can still decide. It not worth it and is too time consuming to place an order yourself then wait for it.


Overall, It’s a decent side gig and should keep you afloat for a month or two. I wouldn’t make it my main job though because of how inconsistent it is.

Good luck my friend!

"Like I said in another comment, I feel like a number, rather than a person. At my first visit (10 weeks), I didn't get an ultrasound because they found a heartbeat so ""I didn't need one"". Besides, I had chosen to do first trimester screening & get the NIPT through maternal/fetal, so they would do the dating ultrasound.
Day before my appointment with maternal fetal, they reviewed my chart and found that, though in the chart correctly, the nurse put my edd in the computer wrong, and therefore I could not get the first trimester screening because I was no longer in the first trimester. I couldn't get an ultrasound that day because ""I didn't need one"".
Reviewing my first appointment paperwork, I also found that the nurse entered answers into the screening questionnaire that I know she didn't ask me.

I had a fantastic obgyn before moving to VA, so I know what a good practice should run like.

And before anyone says that I can get an ultrasound privately, why should I have to pay out of pocket for something that is covered by my insurance that I'm already paying for, that should be included in my treatment?

All that said, maternal fetal was great.",t2_d3ejyayg,churlishaffection,0,1647105840.0,0,t1_i0e1sxy,i0e1sxy,False,churlishaffection,t3_ta8ual,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericksburg/comments/ta8ual/ob_recommendations_in_fred_or_stafford/,OB recommendations in Fred or Stafford?,/r/fredericksburg/comments/ta8ual/ob_recommendations_in_fred_or_stafford/i0e1sxy/,1,r/fredericksburg,0,1

The market is still quite hot, though starting to cool, and every house we saw had multiple offers. The house we bought (8th house we saw) had seven other offers and was only on the market for a weekend (up for sale on Saturday, deadline for offers was 5pm Sunday). 

People are doing crazy things when looking for a house to buy, bringing inspectors to open houses so they can put in offers without contingencies, guaranteeing thousands of dollars over appraisals…you name it. Our offer had an escalation addendum and guaranteed $10k over appraisal; accepted offer was $30k over list and it appraised for $5k over what we paid, ymmv.

"If you're open to a quick drive, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond is amazing, open every day, and free. My wife and I just spent a weekend down in Richmond and hit up the VMFA on Sunday morning. We spent hours there before having to leave to grab some lunch, and only saw a small fraction of everything they had on display. We're definitely planning to go back in the near future.

[http://www.vmfa.museum/](http://www.vmfa.museum/) 

Also, while you're down there, hit up the Crossroads Art Center. It's a gallery and studio collective, similar to Liberty Town or the Torpedo Factory, but much, much larger. We picked up three or four nice pieces while there. The artists are incredibly talented, and the selection is fantastic.

"The difference is that I am asking you to put a cloth over your face when you go outside.  You are asking me to let you contribute to killing my daughter.

The illegality of drunk has nothing to do with alcohol being a controlled substance.  Driving while on your phone is illegal too but phones are not otherwise controlled.  Just as their are laws to prevent distracted driving because it has deadly consequences, there should be laws to prevent people from walking around in public spreading a deadly virus.

The problem is that people who chose not to get vaccinated and get infected are not just hurting themselves, they are potentially fatally affecting everyone who comes into contact with everyone with whom they came into contact.

"To be totally honest, you're not going to change my mind, and I'm not going to change your mind.  You know what?  I know that  I'm not going to change your mind and I'm not going to lose any sleep over it. 

Again, what makes this country great is that we can agree to disagree on topics, I've accepted that you and I are going to disagree on a lot in regards to what's going on now...especially on masks. 

My thinking is also this: those who got the COVID, and didn't get the vaccine, did so on their own ability to make their own decisions.  I'm OK with it, and I'm sure they are too.  Even with the vaccine, people are still getting sick; even though the media did say that if you're vaccinated you can't get COVID...then that mindset changed quick soon after people started getting the vaccine.

The reason why drunk driving is unlawful is b/c  alcohol, also considered a controlled substance even though it's legal to consume,  was used by the person  driving, which impairs  their ability to drive, putting others at risk.  COVID doesn't impair your motor skills and cause you to literally lose control of  a deadly weapon to injure someone else.",t2_69eb6e2m,Patriotfirst2,0,1645492537.0,0,t1_hxwnxnd,hxwnxnd,False,catawsome17,t3_swonz5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericksburg/comments/swonz5/we_dont_gotta_wear_masks_in_school_starting_march/,we dont gotta wear masks in school starting march 1st.

"The government already requires you to wear a seatbelt.  People are already required to get a whole host of vaccines to attend public school and most colleges.

(There may well be a bunch of class action lawsuits for COVID vaccines.  And they will all fail because they are laughably baseless.  For once, thanks to mRNA tech, we have vaccines that are effectively custom printed rather than using forms of the virus. Every possible ill effect of the vaccine is due to your immune response and therefore a more moderate form of what would have happened if you'd gotten the virus.  That's a whole other ball of wax, though.)

VA has about 350 deaths per year from drunk driving, so let's say 700 have died since  Feb 21 2022.  Since March 12 2020, 18,115 people in VA have died of COVID.  That's 6.73 deaths per week from drunk driving vs. 179.36 deaths per week from COVID.  So COVID is almost 27x more deadly than drunk driving, and if everyone simply wore a little bit of cloth over their nose and mouth we would have seen only a comparative handful of deaths.  In light of that, I think it **should** be criminal not to wear a mask.

Which is to say: if drunk driving killed as many people as COVID, I would absolutely be keeping my kids off the streets at night, yes.  Not out of fear, but out of informed prudence.

You are against public goods?  What do you have against interstate highways, lighthouses, and dams?  National defense is a public good -- how are we supposed to defend against communism without it?!  Law enforcement is ideally a public good, and is classified as a quasi-public good only because laws are not evenly enforced.

"Look, I understand where you'e coming from....to a point. When does your rights trump my rights,  same as when are my rights more important than yours?  Should we as a nation be more mindful of others, heck yes.  Do I think that the government should require everyone to wear a mask and force people to put something in their bodies that they don't want and if not, they are jobless? I'm going to have to say no to that.

Remember this, there are commercials on TV where you can get on a class action law suit due to use of certain drugs that have been approved for use by the FDA, because of their side effects that those approved drugs gave to some people.  I'm sure that there are going to be commercials for class action lawsuits for COVID vaccines too.

Since you brought up drunk driving, even though drunk drivers are out there; do you still live in fear and stay in your house and not take any risk to go to work, run errands, go out to eat, etc.? I doubt that you stay in your house b/c of the fear of a drunk driver.  And also drunk driving is literally a crime and is on the books, walking around with COVID and with out a mask is not a crime...well for now anyway.

The Preamble of the Constitution states that an overriding purpose of the U.S. Constitution is to “promote the general welfare,” indicating that issues such as poverty, housing, food and other economic and social welfare issues facing the citizenry were of central concern to the framers.

In fact, the Preamble states that the Constitution exist to create a ""perfect Union"" in the following way:

* Justice - This is establishing a court of justice and allow a jury of peers.
* Domestic Tranquility  - Laws that will guide us to that ""perfect Union"".
* Common Defense - This is our military. 
* General Welfare - See above
* Blessings of Liberty - These blessings include the right to petition the government for redress of grievances, the right to keep and bear arms, and the right of freedom of speech.

"Honestly, from the other side of the equation (local HS teacher) I'm torn:

* On the one hand I'm concerned. With the pandemic continuing and with many of my students of questionable vaccine status (in that I cannot question them about it, I just have to assume they are or imagine that they are not) going masks-off seems like a pretty terrible idea. I'd argue that the majority of my job revolves around taking care of my students (with actually teaching them something often coming in second with the calculus of this job field nowadays), so following policies that can actively harm them really worries me.
* On the other, I'm so tired. Tired of yelling at students to put their masks back on only for them to a) take it off again the second I look away, or b) magically produce a water bottle or otherwise start arguing with me about it. It interrupts my classes on a constant basis, and makes it harder for me to do my (secondary) job everyday.

Will I follow the policy? Of course; I still have to pay my bills, and at the end of the day it's not my responsibility if a child dies or becomes seriously ill over all this. I didn't make the policy, nor did I vote for the people who did (my school board nor Youngkin).

"This could be affected by the VA Clean Economy Act which will increase our rates quite a bit.  The Act essentially is forcing the energy companies to go green and shut down fossil fuel plants, creating a need for renewable energy plants.  I sell solar in the area and because of the VCEA the state has created a funded program for homeowners to install solar at no upfront costs and lock in their current rate because of these rate increases.  Also a lot of people are unaware that your rate fluctuates throughout the year it could just be natural rate changes as well.

"So 2k is about the average for a nice place locally.  There are nearly no rental units available out side of apartments and some good apartments have long waiting lists.  I work in real estate (not a realtor) and we are having a hard time with enough inventory on rentals.  As for apartments, all of them are going to have good points and bad points.  Heading to KG/Dahlgren, Downtown is probably your best bet.  Cobblestone, Monticello, Cowan Crossing and Belmont are the closest.  I wouldn't recommend any of them except Cobblestone.  Cobblestone is some condos and some apartments so there is more owners pride when it comes to things.  The downside is right by the train tracks.  But it is close to a lot of great night life and restaurants in downtown.  If you don't plan on taking advantage of that I wouldn't bother.  If you are just a homebody I would say there are better places as with Cobblestone you are paying for location amongst other things.  Slightly down route 1 from the above mentioned apartments are a handful you should just steer clear of.  Basically anything ON route 1 in that area just isn't worth it.  

&#x200B;

There are some really nice ones a little further south in Spotsylvania like Station Square an Abberly.  Station Square has excellent amenities but it does add a little distance to your commute.  Abberly has some amenities but I think Station square beats it.  I don't know much about rentals in KG as I am not sure there are a lot of apartment complexes like in Fredericksburg.

"FWIW, my family stayed in the Silver collection by the stadium for 6 month and a friend was in the Cosner Corner one for 4 months. It's pretty compared to most and you probably think with the higher rent you'll get more courteous neighbors...in our experience you'd be wrong.  
  
Problems we delt with:. 
  
- dog crap everywhere. Everywhere. 2 people in my building would let their dogs go in the stairwell when it rained.  
  
- pot smoke 24/7. All the time, just coming in from all directions. Management does nothing. My wife was constantly sneezing and we generally just don't like the smell. May not bug some.  
  
- the breakfast is cool, but families will come down early and just fill shopping bags, wiping out everything good. Sometimes they'd do cool items like breakfast sandwiches or french toast, but for the most part it's just convenience store junk food.  
   
- with no assigned parking if you come home late it isn't uncommon to have to park 3 buildings away.  
  
- we had several packages disappear from the mail room. They don't lock it and don't really care. Literally anyone can can drive up, go in the mail room, and walk out with any package sitting around.  
  
There's more, but you get the point. We knew 2 families that terminated their lease a couple months into living there to go elsewhere.

"The Washington Football NFL franchise is a long standing and successful entity in making money for Dan Snyder.   An NFL franchise is not a charity, it's not a ""part of the community"" and has history has shown time and time again, giving money to large elaborate stadiums from tax payers is not a good investment.
It does not create high paying jobs, does not help the economy and does not provide a good return on the investment.
More so, the Washington Football franchise has shown time and again that it would be an even worse investment than other franchises.   They can't even fill the stadium that they have now.  Not because it's old, not because its hard to get to to, buit because the ownership has spent decades disappointing fans
The product on the field has been among the worst in the league since current ownership has taken part.
They are also currently under a congressional investigation for the labour practices.

"Well, I missed the fact it was local to the city ONLY.

I always thought of local as in to the state or city. plus local can mean you can meet cool people at the restaurants that have great vibes and great atmosphere. Not all applebees have the same atmosphere and workers and personalities. Many do of course, but a local one can change it up a bit  


I don't go out much, so I also didn't know MM was in several states. ive only ever seen them in richmond and fred, and richmond was just because i have an ex that lived there. So I just assumed they were a local as in local to virginia, and a band of some kind isn't always gonna come to virginia, so it would be a cool thing to check out and see.  


Different people have different definitions for what local means, and they didn't specify ""local to fred ONLY"", so I just went with what I thought local as. You don't get a MM as often as you do applebees or other chain places (as far as I have seen), so it's still a good choice.
