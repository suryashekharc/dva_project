"The point of the state of CA lifting the state-wide mandate is to allow counties/smaller communities to make their own decisions based on their local situations.  Covid does not infect all areas of the state equally, and an infection rate of ""x"" in one county may or may not be more (or less) impactful on local health resources than that same case rate in some other county.

For Mendocino County, it appears that ICU bed availability is still strained and that the 7-day covid infection rates are still well above where health officials want them to be in order to lift the masking mandate.

"There are a few reasons why this is a problem. It's a decentralized, rural county with a very low population to sq. mile ratio (about 22.4 people per sq mile, less than 1/4 the national average of 93). This means that there's more empty space for each person to go missing in than more populated areas, a lower chance of witnesses, and a lower chance of recovering any remains. There's a big drug problem, both production and use, both of which can easily end up being fatal. If you wander on to someone's land, or you're trimming cannabis for someone who doesn't want to pay you, you might end up missing. Fentanyl related deaths are on the rise, to the point that some locals have speculated that all the dead young women on the side of the road is the work of a serial killer. Mendocino County Sherrif Kendall says ""the serial killer is fentanyl"".  It's also safe to say that some of the missing end up being victim of human trafficking. Many of these are young women, and it's safe to assume that a non-zero percent of those women were taken and sold.

The murder rate is low, sure, but the assault rate is much higher than average, especially around Ukiah and Willits, which is directly adjacent to Brooktrails, where much of the growing inland takes place. The higher ratio of empty space means it's easier to hide a body and harder to recover one. Assaults leave a victim to report the crime, murder doesn't. So, while the verifiable murder rate may be low that's only because local law enforcement is spread too thin and is incapable of finding the body. No body, no murder.

I'm sorry that your friends are missing. I don't mean any of this to sound casual or disrespectful. I hope you're able to find them.",t2_kaok1,ProfHatecraft,0,1645053244.0,0,t1_hx8kc5w,hx8kc5w,True,babyDrakeo2019,t3_sa2lly,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/sa2lly/missing_friends/,Missing friends,/r/ukiah/comments/sa2lly/missing_friends/hx8kc5w/,4,r/ukiah,0,4

"My apologies to you. After re-reading my comment, I can understand how it could come off as accusatory. I failed to clarify originally - let me be clear: I wasn't in any way referring to illegal activity that i assumed was conducted under your business. More so I was trying to agree with the point of the original post - that the whole area near Maverick, the vineyard there, and Ford rd is/ can be a sketch area sometimes (i work at a  Maverick), just like how you say you have to run-off people who don't belong there. 

In no way am I saying your business, F&S, is conducting any illegal activity of any kind. Not trying to lie or spread misinformation. In the future, I will do better to fully clarify my words before posting something potentially harmful to others wellbeing. 

Thank you for your patience and explanations. I hope the area remains safe and I wish you, your business, and family prosperity. Ukiah is a beautiful area, we are all lucky to live here.

"I do own F&S storage, and those same people are walking across your land to get to mine. At least i run them off when i find them. As for the accusations of illegal activities, i can assure you that everything my company does is on the level. That being said, if you don't like what others are doing why not try growing up and minding your own business. I really dont think you deserve an explanation about the empty trailers by the way, but since i am feel generous i will indulge your tiny mind with one. See we have friends who sometimes need help getting vehicles to our yard to store them. We also let those friends borrow a trailer from time to time. The F in F&S stands for Ford...as in Ford road, my family has been at the end of this road for many generations and rest assured they always will be. Thanks for the stupid post by the way, it was entertaining to say the least. Oh and look forward to hearing from my attorney if you ever slander/libel me or my company again.

"Youre the selfish one, trying to give up peoples freedoms out of fear trying to gain some false perception of safety. If the MRNA doesnt do what a vaccine is supposed to do, why do you take it? Why do you blame people who choose not to take it? Dont you have respect for those who have respect for your freedom to choose to take it?! What if people were being restricted from taking it? Dont you appreciate your freedom to choose to take it? Have you ever taken a critical thinking class? I know they only require to take that class if you plan to attend a UC, not a CSU, here in Cali. Do you know what MRNA does? How can you feel ok trying to coerce people into allowing a procedure that they do not want that artificially alters their DNA? Would you want to be coerced into doing something that goes against your code of ethics? Have you ever heard of the ""Nuremberg Code""? Im not religious (I am spiritual), but even I can tell this is what the Christians refer to as the ""Mark of the Beast"", which doesnt have to be fake, just because its from a religious context. Spiritual people in times very different then the times we live in found the most efficient way of sharing information w/the future & ensuring it has the best chance of reaching the future. If you cant see or are choosing to be ignorant of what is happening, then its you who are the problem. If you cant question it, its not science, its tyrany. If you give away freedoms for security, do not expect to regain any of the freedoms you relinquish. The less free a population is, the more easily its governed. Good ideas do not need to be enforced. Your attack on me for sharing info & encouraging discourse is evidence in itself of the inefficacy of your claims. Why dont you look up this info that Ive shared, do some original research, come out & meet the people who are standing up to defend your freedom, that you are condemning for doing so.

"My examples below definitely do not cover all cases, but I hope it'll be enough to help you accept that the situation you observed is one of the better (not best, but better...) of the imperfect compromises caught between ""how to handle the drought"" vs ""an individual's personal freedoms.""

If you're a homeowner (or business owner, but let's focus on homeowners for now), and there's a drought, AND you'd like to remodel your house (or build a new one) - you probably don't want to be told that you cannot do it just because there's a drought.  Where's the connection?  Read on, because there is one.

If you're the person living next door to where the construction is going on...the dust is oppressive without some kind of dust control onsite.  Constant, all day long, possibly even toxic crap kicked-up next door and blowing into your house and into your lungs.  Coughing, gritty teeth, dust accumulating on everything inside and outside.  It sucks.  And it goes on for months.

Best option we have around these days is keeping the ground and heavy equipment somewhat moist to at least reduce the dust's spread, and in some cases curtail it altogether.  It ain't perfect, it uses a lot of water...but the alternative is what?  If you come up with a better, more affordable and easy to use onsite method for dust control (as compared to spraying non-potable water on everything a couple times a day), I'm certain you'll be a multi-millionaire in short order.

Because failing that, these are the options we have left:

* Tell people they cannot do remodels/construction during a drought.
* Tell people they have to deal with all their neighbor's construction dust during a drought.
* Recognize that some exceptions exist where copious amounts of water will continue to be used during a drought (like for construction of various types) while we attempt to reduce water consumption in other areas, like our lawns and gardens (and showers and toilets and swimming pools and car washes....).

Third option is not ideal, but speaking as someone who is BOTH living next door to construction jobs AND is in the process of getting permits for my own remodel...I'll take that third bullet, please.  It's an OK compromise.",t2_2s3b0707,BlueVerdigris,0,1626135174.0,0,t1_h4zcqao,h4zcqao,True,[deleted],t3_oiz6jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/oiz6jz/rant/,Rant.,/r/ukiah/comments/oiz6jz/rant/h4zcqao/,1,r/ukiah,0,1

- Disc Golf - apparently we have some of the best and there are a ton of courses (low Gap, 2 and Lake Mendo, Pomolita, Eagle Peak)
- Mountain Biking (Shokawah trail at Lake Mendo, Annandale in SR) 
- Road Biking. Old River road to Holland is stunning. Dave’s Bike Shop will hook you up locally. 
- books from Mendocino Book company and the library (library was also doing VR stuff and Makers Labs should be coming back soon)
-Concerts in the Park. Starting up soon. 3 this summer. Absolute blast. 
 - Wine tasting. Anderson Valley is world class. We’ve got parducci, Jaxon Keys, Frey, Rivino (also live music on Friday nights)

It sits happily atop a large aquifer and holds pre-1914 water rights, water rights that are over a century old, which means it has first dibs on a lot of the area’s water. In addition due to efforts by the city to increase water security in the aftermath of the 2014–2015 drought, Ukiah has a robust water-recycling program."" I was unable to find any warnings from the City of Ukiah urging conservation (yet).

[Millview Water](http://willowcountywaterdistrict.org/millview) is currently asking customers to conserve.

I think the request for no outdoor watering is currently limited to [Rogina Water](http://roginawatercompany.com/?fbclid=IwAR1IWuknExhtxv44dTwCv9P0XKCECiqjjl7hmT_mv7sY2hgAL8a_i1sFF-k).

"My concern is that it will end up like Willits, where cars are forced to merge and it creates a Suez-canal-style traffic jam in the middle of town when things get busy (though it's better now that they have a bypass). 

With dedicated turn lanes, we've been promised that the traffic will continue to flow smoothly, but that remains to be seen. They want to create a more walkable downtown (like Cloverdale).

In all fairness, some of the sidewalks did need an upgrade, and they will be more accessible. But for traffic... it might end up driving people to the side-streets.

"I've grown up here. My family is all here. (Well accept for the weird rapey cousin branch in Idaho) I had a fairly good childhood, homeschooled and living in a little Mexican neighborhood. (Where I still live) I've made good friends, been a member of our 4-H club, found an amazing, beautiful girl who loves me...and yet as soon as I can I want out of here. (So does she, don't worry) 

This town is hot, filled with smoke every ""Fire-season,"" weed is absolutely everywhere, (In fact that beautiful girl I mentioned is the only friend I have ever made who doesn't get high) then there's the hard drugs which are everywhere if you get out much. Insane and or druged out homeless people wandering around in extremely high numbers to the point where it feels like a 50/50 shot if you ride a bike across town if you're gonna get yelled at by some crazy lady with three teeth. BTW I can't imagine walking this town as a woman. I don't think I'd do it. I work as a delivery driver for food so I've seen the areas that Ukiah would rather you didn't. it's bad some places, and that's all just the big stuff. I haven't even mentioned the simply dumb shit like how the government has decided for some reason to cut our four lane main road down to a two lane for some reason in order to  purposely impede the flow of traffic.

Ya-know what sorry for the rant. This town has been my home since I was born, and it just hurts me to see how bad it is when it could be a nice place to live.

"Similar to you, I grew up in Ukiah in a seemingly simpler time (1980s), left for college and career about 30 years ago.  My parents still live in town and I go back to visit pretty regularly.  So I've seen a lot of changes in the corner of town I tend to stick to (downtown area and eastward to the Russian River; we only rarely wind up on the west side of town).

Going back after so long, you're going to see changes that depress you (areas of town that degraded, signs of homelessness and drug use) even in the best of times, but moreso now with so many businesses closed (many forever) due to COVID.  If you do go back in 2021, just be fair about assuming the place is always like this now - it's not.  ""Bad spots"" migrate around town just like ""good spots"" do, but we tend to focus on the bad more than the good.  And COVID has artificially increased the downtrodden look across the board.

At the same time, as you know, Ukiah is the center of government for Mendocino County: this is a constant force of financial pull, a magnet that keeps the city resilient and ""alive"", as well as constantly changing.  There have been some fantastic restaurants opening up downtown (obviously the charm is lost when you can't actually, you know, enjoy dining out), money does get poured into road and park improvements, and don't discount the additional fun you can have by exploring nearby Hopland, Boonville or Willits for an afternoon (again: COVID disclaimers all around).  

Look for the improvements and new things, accept that not all things last forever, and treat your visit back as more of an exploration of a new place with familiar things rather than trying to get re-acquainted with an old friend.",t2_2s3b0707,BlueVerdigris,0,1613783207.0,0,t1_go2jly3,go2jly3,True,OkAtmosphere1596,t3_lng8ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/lng8ic/what_to_expect_after_being_away_for_10_years/,What to expect after being away for 10 years,/r/ukiah/comments/lng8ic/what_to_expect_after_being_away_for_10_years/go2jly3/,3,r/ukiah,0,3

"The death of Ukiah has been predicted since the logging industry fell apart 30 years ago. It’s still here and it’s still reinventing itself. I agree that gang influence sucks, that’s new and I’m not a fan. I would argue that drugs and crime impact has actually drastically dropped. When you were here and for decades Marijuna was illegal and half the community was considered criminals. Also cartels heavily impacted the drug business. With legalization the main county revenue source has become legitimate and there is a surprising amount of higher end options. Also the slow trickle of Bay Area money has also made an incomplete no act in the area.

We had a beautiful lake that used to draw in big fishing tournaments (would be on ESPN) and thousands of tourists. Not any more.  The lake is nasty, it stinks and full of Hydrillia.

"I moved to Ukiah 2 years ago from the North Bay.

The homeless population in Ukiah is appalling.  People passed out on the steps to the gym, and several congregations around town, derelict and greasy.  Meth rules the day.  If you drive through town, you will probably see at least one “arm-swinger” on the sidewalk.  Not to mention all the fires the “homeless population” has set this year.

The political situation is even worse.  The city management ONLY care about themselves and consistently act ONLY in their own self-interest, and not to mention, they are is chronically overpaid.  $250k to a city manager of UKIAH?  There’s only 15,000 people here!  Why do they need all that money!?  They are currently butchering the downtown, changing from 2 lanes to 1 lane, downtown.  Wtf?

There is no social atmosphere.  There’s one decent bar in town (UKiah Brewing Company), and it’s pretty freakin’ weak.  They actually had 2 good shows when I moved to town, but NOTHING since, even before covid, there wasn’t shit there for a year and a half.

And yes, it is incredibly hot.  We probably had more than (30) 100+ degree days this year.

The pot scene is dead.  It used to be mom and pop, not it’s strictly corporate ASSHATS who have probably never smoked pot, and are strictly in it for the money.

The social scene will probability improve over the next 10-15 years, as people with money SLOWLY move up from the Bay, and demand for better services / restaurants increases.  On that note, there’s currently no worthwhile restaurants in Ukiah.  There is a steakhouse in Redwood Valley (The Broiler Room), but that’s it.  There was one decent place (Simona’s), an Itialian joint, but they closed about 1.5 years ago.",t2_5eb5w2os,ICDF-Augustus,0,1598813479.0,0,t1_g3duh4v,g3duh4v,True,[deleted],t3_ijexsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/ijexsy/moving_to_mendocino_county/,Moving to Mendocino County!,/r/ukiah/comments/ijexsy/moving_to_mendocino_county/g3duh4v/,0,r/ukiah,0,0

For Boonville:
AVB is great if you’re into beer.

Penny Royal farms is a must-stop. It’s basically across the street from AVB, right before the fairgrounds.
They make wine (part of the Navarro Winery family), but on site they raise goats and make cheese. Take a tour, meet the goats, sit on the back patio eat cheese, drink wine, forget about all the ills of the world.

There are a bunch more great spots up and down the valley if wine is your thing.  Just ask.

"Oh, you mentioned wine...one of my favorite topics!

I was very impressed with [Nelson Family Vineyards](https://www.nelsonfamilyvineyards.com/) (should be an easy taxi ride just south of town, well-before you reach Hopland).  I say this as a former arrogant Napa Valley fan-boy.  Still love my Napa wines, but DAMN if Ukiah, Redwood and Alexander valleys haven't stepped-the-hell-up and grabbed their share of brass rings.  Advise to call first, their website doesn't have any Covid-related updates so no idea if hours or tasting protocol have changed.

Saracina Vineyards (just north of Hopland) has beautiful grounds - mixed reviews on the wine (it's quality stuff, just not specifically my style for the most part) but I seriously enjoyed walking around outside while tasting there.  They've got some kind of a hotel room/B&B option onsite that I didn't get to look into - worth asking about because it seemed a very private getaway to stay there for a weekend and take advantage of the trails they have on the property.

Post-Covid, Hopland is worth checking out.  BlueBird Cafe is a good breakfast, lots of small shops with unique things scattered up and down the main drag.  I used to bike into Hopland from Ukiah - pretty sure a taxi/Uber would be reasonably priced as well.  Right now, most of Hopland is probably closed so it'll feel like even more of a ghost town right now than normal.

"Well, Gobbi St. runs east-west (there's W. Gobbi and E. Gobbi), so maybe someone said ""west of State and north of W. Gobbi?""  That would make sense to me - grew up in Ukiah, parents still live there, and while I can't claim to be up-and-current on how all the neighborhoods might have changed in the 30 years since I stopped living there, that region west of State (and definitely north of Gobbi!) was generally considered ""safer"" and ""nicer"" than my neighborhood, on the east side of Highway 101.  

It wasn't a 100% kind of thing - there were (still are) definitely pockets of run-down, even abandoned homes in that ""preferred"" zone that tend to attract vagrants of all types (innocent homeless as well as people involved in illegal drug activities) but the majority tend to be well-maintained properties with law-abiding citizens who bend over backwards to help a child they didn't know who fell off his bike.  I speak from experience.

South side of town was almost a no-man's land, parents did NOT like me riding my bike down past the airport alone.  Oddly, it's still a part of town I pretty much never go to or through - lasting psychological impact even though literally nothing ever happened to me or anyone I knew.

"I grew up in Ukiah - the 1980s were my ""formative years.""  My parents still live in Ukiah, so I take my wife and kid back regularly to visit.  

First, I'll echo /u/100_selfhate's plea:  please don't go now.  Definitely not a good time.  The trip will suck, nobody will want you in their shop even if they decided to stay open to support the locals.  And you'll probably have to sleep in your car and get woken up by a pissed off police officer even if you park legally.  Visitors are really not wanted right now - my family and I are not even going up to see my folks until COVID-19 blows over.

While my father's job did on occasion have him up in Covelo, I have never been there myself.  Other than my father's not-very-positive impressions I can't offer real advice on that one other than ""I've heard it's not a place you'd go unless you had to.""  Seems odd to me that I'd be responding on Reddit years later to someone actually wanting to travel there for leisure?

Boonville, on the other hand - if you're looking for a small town that actually has a thing or two going on, Boonville won't disappoint.  We'll wake up on a Saturday when visiting my parents and just on a whim decide we're going to spend the day in Boonville.  

Sometimes it's a old car meet, or the fair, or wine tasting (seriously, there are several excellent wineries in Boonville, one in particular that makes some awesome cheeses from goats raised on the their own land: Pennyroyal Farm).  There's a place just north of Philo selling great, fresh, apple juice/cider (Gowan's Oak Tree).  Pretty decent random restaurants up and down the main drag - I mean, it's not a bustling college downtown, but you have more than one option and these folks take pride in actually making tasty food.

Boontling is a real thing but it's hard to find people who still speak it.  The last person I knew who spoke it died when I was in high school.  I think my Dad might know another, but not sure.  Yes, you'll see it written above shops and stuff - the trusty ""Bucky Walter"" telephone booth still stands (at least it did last summer).  And you can still get a Horn o'Zeese if you need a pick-me-up.

Not sure I would grab lodging in Boonville, mainly due to lack of services once the sun goes down.  Might want to consider Mendocino or Fort Bragg, and use Boonville as a waypoint for exploring the area, but I imagine if you stayed overnight in Boonville you'd feel pretty damn immersed!",t2_2s3b0707,BlueVerdigris,0,1586147979.0,0,t1_fmk9d50,fmk9d50,True,[deleted],t3_fv9axk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/fv9axk/are_covelo_or_boonville_worth_visiting/,Are Covelo or Boonville worth visiting?,/r/ukiah/comments/fv9axk/are_covelo_or_boonville_worth_visiting/fmk9d50/,3,r/ukiah,0,3

"These days I wouldn't recommend Ukiah for much, sadly. It is getting crowded for a small town. The local bowling alley that was really fun and where a lot of families would take their kids recently closed in favor of a Harbor Freight tool shop. There is natural beauty but it exists in the surrounding area (think Lake Mendocino or Orr Springs Road) and the town itself is a very weird environment. Maybe your kids will have better luck if they grow up here; I've found people pretty closed off and uninterested in making new friends. Then again, I'm in my late 20s out of college and many people my age here seem to spend really a lot of time at one of the four bars in town.

There's the SPACE Performing Arts Center, which is a great after school program for kids. There are races for families over the summer, Sundays in the Park outdoor concerts, a local theater where they can get to know a lot of youth, walking and hiking trails at Low Gap and Cow Mountain,  and anything your kids might be able to find growing up with other kids in this small rural area.

I'll say for what your looking for, in my opinion the good is really good, but the bad is really bad.",t2_2aegw38g,Flecktones37,0,1579551449.0,0,t1_ff3y7sn,ff3y7sn,True,IrishFiddler87,t3_enuzyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/enuzyq/how_is_ukiah_for_families/,How is Ukiah for Families?,/r/ukiah/comments/enuzyq/how_is_ukiah_for_families/ff3y7sn/,2,r/ukiah,0,2
"If you want to provide the best opportunity for your children, stay where you are, or look for a community that invests more in their schools than in the local homeless population.  

Ukiah is a nice town if you are single, want more of a laid back nor-cal lifestyle, and don't venture out from the west side of the city. If you can stay in that small bubble on the westside, things are good!!! There are lots of recreational opportunities, and it is close enough to the coast and mountains for day trips.  

That being said, if you want to live in a place where nearly every other part of town is overrun with homeless people, and you don't mind finding needles and used condoms next to playground swingsets, this is the place for you.  

Please check the crime rates for the area. Ukiah has a much higher crime rate than the national average for violent crime, and hard drug use.  

If I had a family, I would immediately move to parts of Idaho or Utah. There are still wonderful communities there that have lower cost of living and aren't impacted due to the ill-effects of marijuana cultivation and the opioid crisis.  

I say this all to you as someone that is progressive in their politics.  You are focusing on schools, but you need to take a hard look at the community at large because it will have a direct impact on your children.  That being said, at least it's not as bad as Lake County!",t2_5hagjxga,Pancake-JelloSalad,0,1579439685.0,0,t1_fey1vsx,fey1vsx,True,IrishFiddler87,t3_enuzyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/enuzyq/how_is_ukiah_for_families/,How is Ukiah for Families?,/r/ukiah/comments/enuzyq/how_is_ukiah_for_families/fey1vsx/,3,r/ukiah,0,3
"Ukiah is certainly a small town compared to SR. You will find yourself bottlenecked in light traffic on the same three or four streets. There are plenty of options for dining or groceries and a wonderful CoOp. Orr hot springs is close by; the redwoods and coast of Mendocino are on the same path and all make for epic hiking, biking and paddling options. Lake Mendocino is practically next to Ukiah and offers camping swimming and trails to explore. The town of Mendocino itself is a small community you might consider moving to also Fort Bragg. All in all Ukiah is nestled in a deep valley which regulates its temperature and humidity thru the spring and fall months as the summer is similar to any inland California town. Keep it within Mendocino county & you’ll be great.

"Ukiah High School is just about where every student in the area goes. It’s an excellent school with many alternative paths offered to students, such as agriculture, medicine, robotics, etc. The teachers are committed to the students. The students themselves strive for an overall positive campus culture. 

There’s the Waldorf school for younger students, in case you are looking for a charter school with a focus on creativity. One thing I caution, though, is that many students go thru Waldorf, only to end up at UHS with below reading/math/comprehension skills. 

Personally I’m a fan of Grace Hudson Elementary school. They exclusively teach in Spanish until 3rd grade. Enrollment is a lottery, though. Frank Zeek is very good, as well. 

St. Mary’s is the private catholic school in town. Eh. 


 Vaping is a problem in middle and high schools here. 

Many parks in town. Todd Grove does Sundays in the Park, a free summer concert series. Alex Thomas Plaza does Moonlight Movies during the summer, too.  Low Gap is next to UHS and offers disc golf, exercise trails, archery, and dog friendly areas.  There is also Montgomery State Reserve west of town. Lake Mendocino offers camping, kayak & boat friendly, dis golf there too.

There’s 4 bars in Ukiah. Lol. The Office is very chill and intimate.

The homelessness problem is noticeable, for sure. I’ve lived here all my life. It’s increased dramatically, especially during harvest months.

"Well, there are definitely a LOT of rural areas around here. Just depends on how isolated you want to be. In my own opinion: Redwood Valley would probably be one of my top choices. Lots of horse owners, vineyards and a solid country vibe. Potter Valley takes longer to get to, is MUCH more rural, and the commute is a little rougher. Boonville is similar, a bit more upscale, but with winding roads. Brooktrails north of Willits is a mixed bag, but great if you want to live amoungst the redwoods, hike trails, and get a little more bang for your buck. But all that shade can get cold, and forest fires are always a concern. Willits is a cheaper, smaller version of Ukiah, with fewer gang issues but more poverty. West side of Ukiah and the surrounding hills tend to be the prime areas near Ukiah. Vichy Springs is nice, and newer, but does have a literal shooting range across the street. And there are homes around Lake Mendocino as well. The homes in the hills are nicest (often behind gated roads), but expensive. Anything south of Perkins becomes kinda... sketchy. But if you want to completely disappear, you can do that too. There are million-dollar homes here that no one ever sees, and lots of other places people hide. Most crime is usually in the city, or centers around drugs, gangs, and the homeless. I'd still lock your doors, and never leave your car running unattended in a residential neighborhood.  Most of the roads are OK, though many are in need of repair.

"Hello, I know of a couple entrances to these tunnels and yes they do exist.  One of my buddies back in the 60's was able to enter the tunnels through a grate located on the side of the palace hotel, he said the tunnels spanned most of school/state street area (downtown) he didn't explore the entirety of it but he said while he was inside there were concrete cutouts that would allow you to peek inside the basements of the businesses in downtown if their lights were on.  He noticed a grow operation under kmec radio station in downtown.  You can also get a glimpse of the tunnels next to patrona when they have their cellar lights on.   From what I understand the tunnels used to allow people who worked at the court house to travel to local bussinesses for coffee or lunch without having to leave the court house or cross the streets but they were shutdown awhile ago.  There was a guy who wanted to renovate the tunnels and create a speak easy restaurant but that never happened.   Apparently the palace hotel has a 2nd basement that's been filled in that used to have access to these tunnels.

"They're all pretty much under state street downtown and you're probably not gonna be able to get into them unless one of the businesses let's you in to their basement.

On one of the east-west cross streets of downtown, I think maybe Perkins, you can see pinkish purple glass in the sidewalk which I think is basically a sky light to the tunnels.

Idk anything about Hopland though.

Also, if you really wanna go explore in some fun but less than legal places, you can climb the pipe on the side of the palace hotel to get in.

"Welcome to Ukiah. I know some of old the buildings near the courthouse have basements (I've been in a couple). Some may be connected, so you can walk under the different buildings, but I don't know of any tunnels.  Some basements have inconspicuous street vents that you might be able to peek into. But you'd probably need to know a business owner to get into one.

Many years ago, I heard there was a grow operation taking place inside one of them, which got busted when someone noticed the grow lights coming from one of the vents. But that may just be a local legend.

"Lake Mendocino has several (the dam is the most popular). As does Low Gap Park. Vichy Springs Resort has one, but I believe it's private. There is also the rail trail through town, but it has mixed reviews. 
http://mendotrails.org/trails/

Brooktrails in Willits has some nice hiking, but you will have to drive there: 
http://www.btcsd.org/Redwood_Park/trails/BrooktrailsTrails_34x56.pdf

There are also a couple groups on meetup.com that get together for hikes/walks. And Pacific Outfitters often has a group that gets together on Saturday mornings to help pick up trash for an hour, but usually in nice areas like the lake. 

Being surround by mountains, you'd think there would be a lot more opportunities for hiking and nature trails. 

Sometimes we just drive to a nice area of town and walk around and explore (the West side is nice). There's also a park at the end of E. Gobbi by the River you can explore, and a few misc. trails around the Vichy Springs neighborhood.

"Rents are high. I have a studio near downtown and when we post its availability, we get inundated. Right now i have a department head from the County living there and we charge $750 (all utilities included). 

Facebook seems to be a good place to hook up with listings. There is also a yahoo group called mendocommmunity-bb where i have seen people list.

I moved to Mendo in 2007 and Ukiah in 2010. I've found that getting out and volunteering is the best way to hook into a community. There is a cool subculture of young farmers that are doing fun stuff.  Getting involved with trails or biking groups are another way to meet peeps.   

I work a couple of days in Humboldt a week, and I like the dynamic having density (Eureka-Arcata) and the University, despite the Cannaculture. I grew up in Santa Cruz so I may be have built up a tolerance.  I think the proximity to the North-Bay SF tones down the Cannaculture compared to Humboldt, but I also run in an older circle and sowed my wild oats during a decade in SF - but I like being able to get to Santa Rosa in an hour and SF in two if I need a dose of Brighlighting.

Ukiah tends to be a sleepy little town, except for the occasional downtown festival. If you're looking for things to do, you might try walking the dam at Lake Mendocino or hiking around Low Gap park. Strolls around the West side of town are also nice.

I would suggest joining community sports club, like badminton, volleyball, ping pong, disc golf, bowling to meet new friends. Use your co workers to make new friends. Make friends with someone with a nice boat. The lake is fun. The coast is 90 minutes away and its beautiful.

If not, then prepare for the enclosing doom of loneliness. You won't die alone, there are great elder assisted living facilities in ukiah.

Chipotle, apparently. 

On a loosely related note, what really surprised me was the Millview water news. As Millview customers, we've been trying to conserve, and now we hear they actually have *so much* water they could supply hundreds (if not thousands) of additional hookups! Rumor has it the tiered rates were actually intended to penalize the pot growers (the 20% who use 80% of the water), and that the tiered rates were going to be dropped. 

Anyway, this newly available water could translate to small construction boom for Ukiah; I just hope we construct some attractive homes that add to Ukiah's overall appeal, and not just throw up some mobiles on empty lots, or add *even more* low income housing. But hey, that's just my opinion man. :-)",t2_8o8ty,MartyMcFly7,0,1448785199.0,0,t1_cxgliuo,cxgliuo,True,[deleted],t3_3tri0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/ukiah/comments/3tri0n/what_yall_think_about_this_pinoleville_rezone/,What y'all think about this?

"During certain times of the day traffic backs up on Lovers and Kuki for quite some time.  The issue being having to yield when making an unprotected left from Kuki to State.  If there are 3 cars in line on Kuki and you're on Lovers you have an indefinite wait in front of you.

In addition to that when trying to assess oncoming traffic when turning left from Lovers to Kuki, it's impossible to see cars on the road if there any parked against the truckstop building.  

I imagine with the added population in the new development that the traffic time and number of accidents will have large increase.  I don't have specific stats and I know how idiotic it sounds, but I'm positive that accidents on that intersection are common.  Fender benders, close calls, etc.  But the main issue is the inability to assess oncoming traffic when looking right when one is turning from Lovers lane.

I'd imagine people wouldn't move into new homes if they didn't have somewhere to work. 

Not sure what should be done about roads/traffic.

>Do we really need a fucking Chipotle in Ukiah?

I say let them build it. Even if there are already many Mexican restaurants in Ukiah. If they want to buy the land and build a Chipotle, they should be allowed to do so. If people value it they will go to it; if they don't, it will go out of business and leave. You don't have to go there, but if other people want to I don't see what's wrong with that.
