"I'm a transplant by circumstance rather than choice from Tacoma (Seattle) and while I miss the PNW it's nice to not have to deal with the nationalistic vibes that were heavily present in the area. Sort of the opposite sentiment of mtdrake here.

It's interesting, using the mask response which ran pretty straight down the political line as a barometer:  If you drive down to the mall in El Paso, TX plenty of people are still wearing masks and stores have signs ""requiring"" them despite Texas passing legislation to specifically prohibit that behavior. That isn't at all what I was expecting.

Yeah, it's going to be much less of a risk, but you should try to avoid being obnoxious about it and lighting up with people around. I'm moving soon, coming from Oregon (where it feels like there's a dispensary on every other block, sometimes) and even here you're best off finding a quiet place with little foot traffic and not leaving a mess.

"Gotcha!!! I 1000% recommend elks then. There’s several trails nearby! A few in parks that are in the neighborhoods, and then you also have easy access to the big walking/bike trail that runs alongside (but under, if that makes sense. It’s not right up on the road) I-25. As far as shopping goes there’s several convenience stores, an Albertsons, a cvs and Walgreens, and then some other strip-mall stuff along with fast food in the Albertsons complex. Those are all right up on the elks neighborhood, and probably walkable if you really wanted too, to be honest. It’s also super easy to get to the freeway from there for driving to other areas of town, and you can drive to the downtown area I mentioned in like 5-10 minutes. If I were moving there right now (I’m in abq now), I would hands down choose elks. My grandparents and mom all live in the neighborhood and it’s lovely. 

I’m not as well versed in the middle schools in town, but I do have a couple cents to put in on the high schools while I’m here:

Another commenter mentioned Arrowhead ECHS. It’s. A great school, but just so you understand, it’s an extremely rigorous program. It’s designed to where everything is very rapidly paced, and the kids work through the summer ever summer. Basically they complete all four years of high school in the first two years, then the next two years are spent taking all college classes, so effectively at graduation they receive both a high school diploma and an associates degree. If that sounds like something your kid would fit well with, then by all means have at it. But I will tell you that my first year of high school was the first year arrowhead opened, so I’ve known a fair amount of people who went there (including my younger sister who could not stand the place) and had a really hard time. There’s very very little extracurriculars as far as things like music/sports/social activities/etc., it’s all VERY academic based and while I did know a few people who fit super well there, I’ve known more people who had a really hard time and said it wasn’t a great place for their mental health. Personally I think teenagers need more opportunities for exploration and social lives than arrowhead offers, but that’s just me. 

The opposite side of the spectrum is Alma d’Arte Charter School (i went there my senior year and graduated from there). It’s a super small school focused very much around the arts and pretty much designated for the “alternative” kids. It has a reputation of having a drug problem (really it’s mostly just some weed, and honestly the other schools are probably just as bad if not worse) which it does a bit but honestly it gets way more trouble than it deserves in my opinion. Alma shines for having teachers that truly care about their students, and being a super inclusive place for kids that might not fit in at other schools. It’s a slower-paced school and offers a ton of alternative options like dance class for pe credit, independent study classes, etc. Like arrowhead, it’s not the best fit for everyone, but the people it works for, it *really works for*.

There’s several alternative schools that are mostly for making up credits to help people graduate. Not super familiar with those.

Then there’s the big four regular high schools. Organ Mountain (which used to be Onate), Centennial (the newest, I think it opened in 2012), Las Cruces High, and Mayfield. They’re all pretty much your generic high school, but I’m partial to Mayfield because that’s where I went for my first three years, and also it’s the closest to the Elks area. 

Honestly, mostly I just wanted to give some information on Arrowhead but I figured I might as well include the others too.",t2_16lzfh,cannababushka,0,1648176509.0,0,t1_i20nlpw,i20nlpw,False,Thehippieagent,t3_tn6il8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/tn6il8/favorite_neighborhoods/,Favorite Neighborhoods,/r/LasCruces/comments/tn6il8/favorite_neighborhoods/i20nlpw/,2,r/LasCruces,0,2

"While yes all of that stuff is pertinent to a job listing, I figured if someone was interested enough I can help to fill answer those questions via DM. You’re right though, I should’ve put up job details on the initial post. I’ll edit that now to reflect what I have available.

Considering other cool positions in the area are paying in the same range…most are lower. Both DQ and Raising Canes are starting at 12/hr. Mcallisters is at 13. I know Peppers/DE  was paying 12.50 for cooks. None of these are offering any shared tips and all are large corps that can definitely afford to pay higher wages, but don’t. 

The bar manager sits down every Sunday and does the math for the tip sharing. It’s based on who’s on shift during the hour and splitting that between the two teams.

"Personally, I think the nicest area to live in is the Elks area (where you were talking about with the three crosses hospital). It’s a really nice, established, safe neighborhood but also affordable. It’s in town so close to everything, but doesn’t fit your criteria of being within walking distance to much. 

The perfect area for you guys re: watering hole, comics, skating, cute-fun-neighborhood vibe is smack in the middle of downtown, off main/water streets. But there’s not many houses actually right in that area, and I’m assuming the ones that are there are not for sale or very expensive. The closest neighborhood would be alameda, which depending on exactly where you are could be walking distance to downtown but might be a bit of a stretch depending on how far you want to be walking. 

You don’t want to be near young’s park, and probably not the university either. 

Sonoma Ranch will have nice looking houses, but be aware that it’ll be within walking distance to absolutely nothing. For your lifestyle, I wouldn’t go with anything off hwy 70. 

Mesilla park would probably work pretty well but just from my own experience, honestly as a kid I probably would’ve been very bored living there. It’s kind of removed from the rest of town (it’s its own town actually if I’m not mistaken), and it very much has the old-people-tourist-vibe. 

Overall, keep in mind that in general Las Cruces is not a walking city. It’s very much a driving city and it’s not super common to have neighborhoods where business are mixed in with houses. It’s a lot of housing areas broken up by various shopping areas, and mostly you need to be using a car to get from one to the other.",t2_16lzfh,cannababushka,0,1648173368.0,0,t1_i20grk9,i20grk9,True,Thehippieagent,t3_tn6il8,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/tn6il8/favorite_neighborhoods/,Favorite Neighborhoods,/r/LasCruces/comments/tn6il8/favorite_neighborhoods/i20grk9/,5,r/LasCruces,0,5

Yeah... three Albertson's, four Walmarts (and I guess Target although their selection is a bit limited) are the only major chains. There are three independent grocers (three that I can think of) that are OK I guess. There is Toucan Market which is locally owned, and a bit upscale and has more international options and the like; nice but a bit pricey. Then a Natural Grocer and a Sprout's Market that tend towards the Whole Foods organic kind of stuff. Sam's Club. There's a small international market. Likely I'm forgetting something.

I do so much shopping online too. But it's still nice to be able to go shopping. Here I get my groceries delivered here most of the time. Has that picked up there? Or curbside pickup if not delivery? That would be an adjustment for sure. Most of the houses I have looked at online have the Organ Mountains in the background. Sonoma Ranch is another name I've heard more than once.

As for specific neighborhoods, there are several relatively expensive (for Las Cruces) ones that are nice and several more less expensive ones that are pretty nice as well.

"I moved here from Phoenix four years ago to retire and absolutely love it. Lived in Phoenix for 29 years and really don't miss it at all. Sure, there was a lot to do there and shopping was great but between the traffic, five months of 100-120º days/90º nights and 5,000,000+ people, smaller town living is very agreeable to me. Shopping isn't great compared to bigger cities but good enough to get by. I order lots of non-grocery stuff online anyway.

The city basically rolls up the sidewalks at night and restaurants close very early but none of that bothers me in the least.

I live out east of town off of Dripping Springs Road which I find very nice and quiet. As mentioned, I'd look in the Las Alturas area or Desert Mirage/Organ Mesa first. It is very beautiful out here with the Organ Mtns. so close. Also some nice areas off of Sonoma Ranch Blvd. Just depends on what you are looking for.

Come and visit for a few days if you can and find a realtor to show you around. See if you like the town.

"I've often thought that the Austin->Las Cruces route would likely become a thing. As people get tired of the traffic in Austin, or as living there becomes too costly, LC is really one of the first adequate mid-level cities on the way West. Be prepared to feel the opposite of all things Austin: Traffic is not at all bad and the slow drivers make driving safer; home prices are affordable; taxes are low; and life is sometimes so chill it seems like not much is happening at all. This is a good thing. Too much business causes a lot of problems that Cruces doesn't have yet. Still, as more Austinites follow that path, it will pick up pace in the coming years.

"Sounds like a plan. You'll miss the traffic (not) but there's going to be a lot less going on than Austin. And that's one reason why we, after spending a few days in Austin and driving the rental car over to Cruces, decided Austin was fun to visit but not where we wanted to live. 

I would think about living in an area like Las Alturas (88011) instead of out by the newer places across Highway 70. That'll put you ten minutes closer to El Paso, and you may wind up going there regularly for medical care. But you can drive across town here in 20 minutes and El Paso is less than an hour away.

btw, you could sell a car and probably do okay, and get killer money for it. One less thing to move and your hubby probably isn't driving yet anyway. Then buy another one in a year or two when the market likely will be better (or figure out that you don't need the second vehicle). Over the last \~35 years, we've shared a car for about ten of those years, and it's easily doable, especially if one of you can work at home.

"As a university town we punch a little above our weight for a small town for things like concerts and theater. We have some of the best Mexican food in the world, although generally disappointing and limited international dining options. It's easy to get around town, without much in the way of traffic. One side of the city to the other is generally less than 25 minutes, and even if you live on the outskirts of town most places you want to go will be within 15 minutes. Great hiking and biking as long as you enjoy desert terrain. People are generally friendly. Shopping is pretty adequate, especially with online options. 

Cost of living is pretty low. There's a reason we routinely do well in rankings of retirement cities. Access to healthcare is pretty good, although the wait times for certain specialists can be bad. You might want to check on that in advance with the health concerns you've discussed. 

For things that don't exist in a smallish city, there's El Paso. Which, let's be honest, won't show up on many people's lists of top cities, but it's there. Tucson, Albuquerque, and Phoenix are all within a day's drive and lovely. To beat the heat there is the Gila National Forest and Lincoln National Forest if you like camping; cities like Ruidoso and Silver City if civilization is more your style. Mexico is an easy trip for leisure, or reduced medication costs and medical care.

"You'll want something on the east side of town; that's where the two hospitals and majority medical facilities are located (pretty much within a mile or two of the mall). It's where the majority of shopping is located as well. West side of town is more sparse as it's more farmland and lower-income. Significantly more money has been put into the east side than west. 

It's fairly quiet with relatively low crime. Slow ass drivers, but nothing like big city traffic. Moved back from California and traffic here is nothing compared to the big cities. The people are very friendly and rather  welcoming (including LGBTQ+ community). Basically, bring beer to a BBQ and you're pretty much family lol. 

I grew up here and moved back last fall after 10yrs. I've lived all over the US and Las Cruces is a very nice place to live in comparison. Downside is a lack of higher paying jobs.

"There's a Farm and Ranch Heritage Museum in town – it's a large museum with a lot of exhibits including live farm animals, a working blacksmith, etc.  Worth checking out if you're at all interested in the subject matter.

If you are interested in geology, there's a small but impressive geology collection called the Zuhl museum on campus with lots of beautiful geodes and fossils.

The downtown mall has some nice shopping, theaters, and night life. Get your nerd on at Zia Comics (they sell games, comics, and ice cream) and the Rad Retrocade (a bar with vintage video game machines and pinball machines).

The Mesilla plaza has some interesting shopping and some good dining.  La Posta is a very old restaurant with impressive atmosphere (including a parrot sanctuary in the lobby); its food isn't *quite* as good as some local places like Andele or Salud, but it's a crowd-pleaser for the eye candy.  Double Eagle on the plaza is the ""fancy"" place to go. The Fountain is an independent theater that shows foreign and art films.

Depending on how much travel you'd like to do, some nice places within 2-4 hour driving distance are:

* (4 hours north) The zoological park (Zoo, Botanical Gardens, and Aquarium) in Albuquerque, which is near the old town, Albuquerque Museum, the Natural History museum, and Explora science museum.  Lots of other attractions in Albuquerque, too, including one of the longest tram rides in the world. Vibrant night life, lots of cuisine, theaters, music venues, etc.
* (1 hour east) White Sands national park and visitor center. Bring a picnic and plenty of water for a must-see natural wonder.  Just beyond that in Alamogordo is a nice museum about the space program with a planetarium.  There's also a small zoo in Alamogordo.
* (5 hours north) Just north of Albuquerque is Santa Fe, filled with art and museums.  Rancho de los Golondrinas is a beautiful living historical museum just south of Santa Fe worth visiting.
* (1.5 hours northeast) Ruidoso is a cozy little town up in the mountains with shopping and plenty of AirBNB cabins to rent.  Inn of the Mountain Gods is the big luxury hotel on a beautiful mountain lake if you prefer the hotel experience.
* (4 hours east) Carlsbad Caverns is an *incredible* natural wonder which is in my opinion the don't-miss attraction of New Mexico, especially if you've never been into a living limestone cave.  The walking tour is the best part, but you can also take the elevator down if you have trouble walking down slopes.  The ""Big Room"" at the bottom is home to spectacular speleothems and gorgeous formations, all lit up dramatically. Highly recommended.",t2_3y52x,onewayout,0,1647897729.0,0,t1_i1kxys4,i1kxys4,True,Drakekissedme,t3_tjgxpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/tjgxpc/must_see_places/,Must see places?,/r/LasCruces/comments/tjgxpc/must_see_places/i1kxys4/,3,r/LasCruces,0,3
"White Sands camping has been closed for some time. I was there a couple weeks ago and camping was still not opened back up. No idea when it will be open again. 

Gila is a great option for backpacking with so much access to water. Right now, lows are around freezing so in 6 weeks, it should be nice. 

If it isn’t too hot, city of rocks can be a good option for star gazing if it is a new moon or if the moon is up during the day.

If you are car camping, there are also lots of options in any of the national forest to get away, whether that’s heading east to Cloudcroft/Ruidoso, west to the Gila, or north to Cibola NF/ Gila NF.

"I moved here exactly one year ago.  Your first question, I think you should be fine.  I have seen many instances of openly gay/queer people in public spaces and working at the shops I've been to.  Never once have seen anybody bat an eyelash.  Refreshing, since I came from northern Wisconsin, where nobody would say anything out loud, but would for sure talk about it later.

Housing....oy.  I got here March 17.  I ended up living at the Townhome Suites up on north Telshor for two months.  Our budget was open to $300k maximum.  Houses were being bought up before I even had a chance to look at them.  It was a serious stroke of luck that we ended up with the house we did.  We paid just over $260k and it is NOT a mansion.  It's a 30-year old house down by Old Mesilla.  But I am happy with it and you couldn't pay me to live up where the developments are.  Houses are packed in like sardines up on the mesa by the thousands.  That's not my lifestyle, but to each their own.  Looking for houses really needs to be done in person, in my opinion, but I know that many were buying sight unseen for a while there.

The hiking and biking options are great, but I'm not super experienced in either.  My husband rides bike, and from Old Mesilla, you can hop on a paved trail that goes to La Lorena Park and for many miles through town.  We have hiked Dripping Springs trail, the La Cueva trail, Fillmore Canyon, Soledad Canyon, and Picacho Peak so far.  There are many places we haven't been that we would love to go and haven't yet had the time.

If you were here before and loved it, I think you'll still love it, but it's just much busier now.  Traffic is very busy...but to be honest, I just stay down here in the valley and avoid anything northeast of I-10 if I can help it.  I think you'll be shocked at the amount of traffic on Lohman now as compared to 10 years ago.",t2_horjscqf,LandofConfusion2021,0,1647432426.0,0,t1_i0vi7n8,i0vi7n8,True,jasebelyx,t3_tfa3gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/tfa3gm/moving_back_to_las_cruces/,Moving back to Las Cruces,/r/LasCruces/comments/tfa3gm/moving_back_to_las_cruces/i0vi7n8/,15,r/LasCruces,0,15
"Okay so I moved to ABQ (from cruces) two years ago so others can chime in as well, because cruces has been *rapidly* growing and changing so things could honestly be pretty different than I remember. 

For LGBTQ+, you should be fine. I was a queer teenager through the 2010s there and never really ran into any problems (besides maybe lack of a dating pool but obviously that shouldn’t be a problem since you’re married). You’ve got a fair amount of conservatives but even they tend to be pretty quiet from my experience. And especially around areas like university and downtown, things seem to be pretty young-leaning with your standard modern ideals (aka, accepting of others). 

I’m not super well versed on the real estate but I do know my mom had been looking into buying a house to rent out recently and was able to find tons of good ones in her price range (<$175k). Based on my knowledge of the real estate there purely from looking at houses on Zillow through the years, you can pretty much buy a mansion for $300k. I’m not sure exactly what your expectations are for how nice/big/fancy of a house you’re looking for are, but I will cautiously say that that’s a huge budget and I wouldn’t anticipate any problems. I can’t comment on the competitiveness other than to say that when my mom was looking, the houses weren’t remaining on the market long but they also weren’t necessarily flying off the market immediately either. 

For internet, last time I knew you have two options: century link and Xfinity. Both suck but Xfinity tends to have much better speeds and reliability. I never had a problem with my Xfinity there speed-wise, but they do suck to deal with as a company. But I’ve heard century link really isn’t better, and that the service is slower/less reliable so personally I’d just go with Xfinity. 

Tons of hiking and mountain biking but I’m not super into either. I have seen people ask about both though and the comments usually recommend looking up these local hiking/biking groups. I can’t remember if they specifically said Facebook groups or if it was something on a meetup app, but I’ve for sure seen people talk about these groups a lot before. 

In general, like I mentioned at the beginning of my post Las Cruces has been changing and growing *a lot*. Just my personal observations: I moved from Santa Fe to cruces in 2010 and then to abq in 2020. When I first moved to cruces in 2010, I remember how sparse the city felt as far as recreation, art, culture I guess? Idk, I was 13 and had lived in Santa Fe my whole life where there’s a ton of art and events and it’s overall just super vibrant and bustling even though it’s a smaller city. I remember being struck by how boring las cruces felt, how there were so many empty storefronts, how there were very few events to go to, how art didn’t seem super prevalent around the city, etc. 

Through those ten years things started to change a lot. I would say the best part is that they’ve put a *ton* of work into the downtown area. I remember going to the farmers market in the early 2010s and all the stores along the road were empty, but now basically every single one is filled. Stuff like breweries, the arcade bar, a comic store, boutiques, antique shops, cafes, yoga studio, etc. Plus they added this giant public space with a splash pad and a stage and in the open area they sometimes have outdoor public art exhibitions and stuff. There’s also way more events that take place there, versus it just being the farmers market spot. The way that downtown is shifting is (I think) a good picture of how the town is shifting as a whole. 

The other biggest change is that hwy 70 is being developed like crazy. What used to be totally empty has *exploded*, and I honestly down even know what all is up there at this point because I know they’ve built a ton more since I moved. It’s legit like a whole new town over there lol it’s crazy.",t2_16lzfh,cannababushka,0,1647426789.0,0,t1_i0v9unz,i0v9unz,True,jasebelyx,t3_tfa3gm,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/tfa3gm/moving_back_to_las_cruces/,Moving back to Las Cruces,/r/LasCruces/comments/tfa3gm/moving_back_to_las_cruces/i0v9unz/,6,r/LasCruces,0,6

"Yes, +1 for Andele. A local favorite. Across the street from it is the Andele Dog House where you can get Andele food to go or sit on a patio that lets people bring their dogs.

Salud up the street is also very good. Their food is more experimental (their chef comes out with new menu additions each season), and very tasty. They have a full bar. Their burgers are great, but my favorite are the roasted shishito peppers in ponzu sauce. Nice atmosphere, too.

You might also like La Posta on the Mesilla Plaza. The food isn’t *quite* as good as Andele, but it’s still a treat to go there for the historical, beautiful building. The reception area is lush with plants and has a giant cage with talking birds. (Kids especially love that.) Lots of gorgeous decorations, fountains, a few shops, and margaritas make it a place we take out-of-town friends when they come, just for the experience. They, too, have a full bar. Follow it up with a stroll on the plaza.

"I've lived in all three cities, so I think I might have a bit of insight here.

El Paso has a huge immigrant population and immigrants are statistically less likely to commit crimes than US citizens. Immigrants are also far less likely to report crimes so in reality I don't think that El Paso is as low crime as it seems on paper.

El Paso also has a functioning police force and judges are semi-competent when compared to Albuquerque. Albuquerque PD is one of the least effective and most violent departments in the United States. New Mexico also believes that people are innocent until proven guilty in a way that Texas doesn't. That is a good thing but Abq judges take it too far and let dangerous criminals out when they really shouldn't. 

New Mexico is a much poorer state than Texas with fewer job opportunities and a much worse education system. I suspect that El Paso County joining New Mexico would double NM's GDP. New Mexico has also always been a very remote state where we more or less let people do what they want, which means more freedoms than a state like Texas but also a lot more opportunity to find trouble.

I also disagree that Albuquerque and El Paso are so similar. On paper, they have similar populations with military bases and major universities. In practice, Albuquerque is a much more diverse city than El Paso. With more diversity comes more inequality, which leads to more crime. Albuquerque has a huge homeless population as well. From what I can see there are probably more homeless people total in Las Cruces than El Paso. On a similar note, Albuquerque is the main city in New Mexico, and everyone in New Mexico kind of gravitates towards Albuquerque, which is an issue that El Paso doesn't have.

In a nutshell, Albuquerque is in a much poorer state, is much more diverse, has a notoriously ineffective justice system, and has a much more liberal-libertarian attitude.

El Paso is an exceptionally safe city, but I also think it has a higher crime rate than is reported. Immigrants are also much less likely to report crimes. I suspect that crimes that begin in El Paso but end in Juarez are not factored into the crime rate. Especially considering the size, I very highly doubt that you are safer in El Paso than Las Cruces or vice versa.

I absolutely \*do not\* think that ""backing the blue"" in Albuquerque is the way to go, mostly because APD is responsible for a lot of Albuquerque's crime by blatantly ignoring it. New Mexico will always be more dangerous than Texas because NM respects people's constitutional right to due process and just generally being left alone, but that is exasperated by Albuquerque judges being too lenient. I don't think that going full-on right wing with no compassion is the way to go in New Mexico because I think that would make our poverty, and thus our crime, worse. I do think that Albuquerque needs to figure out a way to just completely start from the ground up with APD because the APD's culture is just to far gone and I think that New Mexicans need to hold our judges accountable more.",t2_5cku26rn,opened_padlock,0,1645909625.0,0,t1_hyk79mb,hyk79mb,True,Yopreguntas18,t3_t17y0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/t17y0x/why_is_el_paso_so_much_safer_than_las_cruces_and/,Why is El Paso so much safer than Las Cruces and Albuquerque?,/r/LasCruces/comments/t17y0x/why_is_el_paso_so_much_safer_than_las_cruces_and/hyk79mb/,3,r/LasCruces,0,3

"Downtown plaza has some shops. Mesilla has some also to check out a few hrs. A day trip to white sands is great to see keeping in mind it is all sand/desert so plan to take shade, water, heat prep and avoid wind.
Hiking dripping springs or lower hermit cave and Soledad canyon is a great short 2-3 mile round hike, safe.
 Drive toward dripping springs the. Baylor canyon and sunset and fall in love with the best sunsets.

Local food is a must.
Nopalotos, nueva Casita, el Sombrero, Los compas, mariachis, zia Cafe, las trancas are great Mexican restaurants.

"Yo I trust the CDC too. No need to get so aggressive. “As of the week ending January 22, 2022, Omicron was estimated to account for 99.2% (95% CI = 99.0%–99.5%) of SARS-CoV-2 infections nationwide, and Delta for 0.7% (95% CI = 0.5%–1.0%).” So I will redact my first link as you just taught me they are biased and give you the CDCs. It actually supports my point more than the other data. Omicron is displacing the other variants. Plain and simple. 

It really really sucks that masks didn’t work like we wanted them to with omicron. I’m not happy about it ether. That’s part of the reason why we had an infection spike from hell. There’s no avoided what happened. Masks could only go so far with this variant. 

So again I say we are at the point in this pandemic we have tools to protect ourselves without the mask mandate. Get vaccinated, stay home if sick, get tested, and wear a properly fitted N95 if you feel unsafe. I think we’re getting close to the end solution. It’s been a shitty ride but I’m ready to see the faces of my community again.

"I’m not saying not to bother with masks. I’m saying wear an N95 (or equal to/better) or you’re really not protecting others or yourself. I’m not anti mask and will never be but it’s okay to realize crappy masks (cloth, surgical) aren’t working as well because of the nature of omicron. It duplicates in the upper respiratory fast resulting in so much more infections breaking through our precautions. 

I have worn my mask religiously and still gotten sick in this extreme spike in cases. The positive cases in New Mexico itself prove the point that the bulk of masks we are wearing were not stopping infections. 

At this point we have enough for us to protect ourselves without mandating masks. Just be smart, get your vaccines, stay home if sick, wear an N95 if you don’t feel safe, be cautions around our elderly, and get tested. We need to try to move forward for the sake of the kids and mental health. I don’t want to fight. I just wish we could all forget the politics of it all and learn to be our own critical thinkers.

"The Needle is only for expert hikers or someone who knows exactly the path plus someone who isn't an expert, but well versed in moderately technical hiking. The Needle probably has the largest death list of all hikes in the region. The trip down is many times worse than the trip up, and the latest conditions I have experienced are quite loose in footing. 

In contrast to marine_drafter, I have always done it in a single day, but it has been the hardest hike I've ever done, and yes, it takes at *least* 12 hours. 

You MUST take at least 3 gallons of water per person, you should leave a 2000 calorie meal for yourself at the saddle to retrieve when you come down, you cannot hike in the dark, and the path up and down is *not* well marked. If you don't know the way up, you won't necessarily be able to just figure it out.

edit: 24 hikers were taken off the mountain last year who came from El Paso, their biggest problems were that they were not able to make it off the mountain before the sun came down, they didn't have sufficient water, they got lost, they sustained cactus injuries, and they took several falls. If you don't know the route and don't start before sunrise this time of year, this will be your fate as well.

Further edit. I had kinda mid-remembered the time commitment.

"The needle is a very hard/time consuming hike that involves climbing and can be easy to lose. If you are an experienced hiker and have no older people, small children or pets you can usually do it in 12-16 hours, 6-8 hours each way. Everyone I know that has completed it had done it in 2 days. There are a lot of hikes, but if you are looking for some view and a cool mountain climb consider the Baylor Canyon trail as well that will give you a view to White sands military base and the Mesilla valley (containing Las Cruces and Dona Ana)

I cannot answer the ice question, but if it's early March it's likely to have some ice, depending on if the weather is locally over 65 or not in town. 

For area food (with some heat), I recommend Si Senor (or Si Senor Express if you are in a hurry). Another strong alternative is Chachi's for Mexican food. 

If you are looking for more anglo-centric food, Lorenzo's makes good Italian.

"I'm not sure what the real estate market is doing right now, but when we bought our house last spring, I'd say we spent probably $40,000 more than we would have a couple of years ago.  There was no time to even think about whether you loved the home, you had to put an offer in immediately and go above asking price to even stand a chance.  We were looking at homes at 9:00 at night in the dark with 20 other potential buyers waiting to walk through.  It was insane.  As for buying new, I know the lots up east are selling like hotcakes.  They are currently developing the last of the available land up there.  Many many many houses packed in up there.  The Talavera area is very nice, but not sure if it's within your budget.  Picacho Hills is a nice area, but not sure what's available.  I've heard Rassaf Hills is nice, but I haven't seen it.  Sonoma Ranch used to be ""the place to buy"", but it's pretty packed in right now.  We found a 30-year old home on the southwest edge of the city and paid $260,000.  Don't forget the random lots in the valley.  IF I were to ever build (not gonna happen), I would look for a lot in the Valley.  Close to LaLorena park with great biking trails and also to Picacho Mtn., which has great hiking, though you need a 4WD to get to it, and also close to Old Mesilla.",t2_horjscqf,LandofConfusion2021,0,1644583448.0,0,t1_hwhxh1t,hwhxh1t,True,LucyCat987,t3_spg00h,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/spg00h/considering_moving_to_las_cruces/,Considering moving to Las Cruces,/r/LasCruces/comments/spg00h/considering_moving_to_las_cruces/hwhxh1t/,2,r/LasCruces,0,2

"I retired here and absolutely love it. It's not for everybody though. If you are looking for sophisticated, high end type area with lots of amenities this isn't the place.

For that money you can get a nice house which was one of the reasons I chose LC. I know a good builder who built my house. PM me for his info.

I like it out east of town in the Desert Mirage area or Talavera (if you don't mind rustic & rough dirt roads). Lots of wide open space out here. And supposedly we are getting Comcast/Xfinity out here soon so hopefully I can finally get broadband internet.

When I moved here I hiked a lot but then switched to road biking and recently mountain biking. Now you can't get me off the mountain bike. The weather allows me to ride the vast majority of days throughout the year. Pretty nice riding east of Soledad Canyon Road or on Soledad Canyon Road. Lots of climbing but very little traffic. And if you do take up trail riding there's great trail out this way that is almost deserted. I've never ridden in town but as mentioned LC isn't particularly cycling friendly and it would scare me to ride on a lot of the roads in the city.

"There is great hiking in town. While there is also great mountain biking, the infrastructure for road cycling isn't great. To be fair, it's crap most places in the US as well. There are some nice multi-use paths for cycling. Some of the major roads have decent bike lanes, but it's spotty. Drivers are... drivers. I guess it largely depends on what your goal is. If you're looking for a place to have a nice ride there are options. If you're looking to get from place A to place B using the bike as transportation it can take some planning, and in some cases less than ideal circumstances. 

There are plenty of nice homes in town in the $200,000 to $300,000 price range. We're far more affordable than most places. It just depends on what you're looking for and where--but even homes on the outskirts of town are still only going to be less than 15 minutes from most things in town.",t2_tykf1qc,ThatsWhatXiSaid,0,1644534840.0,0,t1_hwfku2g,hwfku2g,True,LucyCat987,t3_spg00h,https://www.reddit.com/r/LasCruces/comments/spg00h/considering_moving_to_las_cruces/,Considering moving to Las Cruces,/r/LasCruces/comments/spg00h/considering_moving_to_las_cruces/hwfku2g/,5,r/LasCruces,0,5

"Definitely not Rays Auto Glass. I’ve had 2 replaced by them. They left a rather large scratch on the first one and wouldn’t do anything about it besides offering a small discount on the next I get.

I go to do another a few years later at Rays because I like to support small businesses and it was the pandemic times, so I don’t even bring up the discount cause everyone’s struggling during the pandemic, but I had my windows tinted (at another location) and was told not to roll down the windows for a few days so the tint doesn’t mess up. I relayed that to Ray and he assured me it would be fine if they were rolled down, but he wouldn’t do it anyway. Go to pick up the car and lo-and behold ALL my windows are down.

"I thought it was amazing that they *actually made it rain in the theater* on the stage.  That was bold.

The cast did a great job, I thought, and it was an enjoyable show.

Kathy Selden brought the singing. Just *solid*.

Lena Lamont absolutely *nailed* that character from the movie (and it couldn't have been easy maintaining that voice).

And I have to give props for anyone taking on ""Make 'em Laugh"" and succeeding.  That *has* to be one of the most challenging songs in all of the Broadway songs to attempt because you have to be funny, you have to perform physical gags with timing, *and* you have to do it all while carrying the fast-paced singing for the piece all by yourself.
