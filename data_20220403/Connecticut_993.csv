"All of the surrounding towns are fairly nice. And depending on where you live in the surrounding towns you may or may not be in a flight path. 

A lot of people are suggesting Avon, Simsbury, Granby. All very nice towns. But they are more expensive. Farmington Avon, Simsbury are going to likely be the most expensive towns to move to in the area. 

On the other side of the airport you have Enfield, east Windsor, south Windsor. Enfield has nice parts but center of town is lower income area. But it has a modest commercial district with most standard chain stores. 

Be careful looking in East Windsor and South Windsor. There are a limited number of bridges I've the Connecticut river. But if you get the right place in East Windsor you are probably going to be much closer time wise than Simsbury, Avon, or Canton.

Bloomfield is a nice town. As is Windsor. You will find a mix of income levels in different neighborhoods. You will also find more racial/ethnic diversity in Windsor/Bloomfield. The north side of both Bloomfield and Windsor have very easy access to the airport. As does the east side of Granby. Suffield is another town that many people regard as ""desirable"" as Simsbury or Avon.

If you want a more urban/city feeling upper income towns of west Hartford and Glastonbury.

You could also look at Hartford if you really like a city environment. While long regard as not a desirable place, downtown Hartford has seen a increase in popularity for young professionals. 

The schools ""quality"" rankings does tend to follow how wealthy and a town is. But keep in mind generally a parents socioeconomic standing has a bigger impact on academic success than the school. That being said there are a number of charter schools in the Hartford area. 

You are going to find low crime and access to coffee shops in any of the towns will a develop town center. Simsbury, Windsor, Bloomfield, south Windsor, suffield, Granby, Avon in descending order of small town appealing town centers. East Granby is a nice town but a shopping plaza is not much of a town center.

"When you go in, there’s a lobby when they check your ID. 
When you enter “the vault” there’s a staff member that waits with a tablet, they’ll confirm your name and ask what you want. Have a general idea, if you want edibles, ask for them to help you decide. It can be overwhelming and intimidating. If you’re looking for edibles, you’ll want to know if you want an indica, a sativa, or a hybrid. (I just learned all of this myself lol.) be specific, are you looking to relax and chill out at the end of the day? Is it for anxiety and helping you sleep? Or do you want to get high and hang out and do fun things? Let them know exactly what your intent is. There are differences. Once you’ve decided, the staff member will go in the back and get it for you, and you’ll go up to the register. I would bring cash. They do this weird thing where they have to round up on credit or debit and then give you the change in cash, I still don’t understand why. 
But overall, I’ve never spent less than like 80 dollars there, and I don’t buy a lot. 

If you’re worried about smoking in your apartment, look into vapes, they work faster than edibles, and a 60 dollar cartridge can last me a month or more, and they don’t have the weed smell. They have so many different flavors and types. The last one I got as a grapefruit flavored/scented.

Edit to add, every time I’ve used their edibles it takes hours to get the effect. I would highly suggest a vape. Works quickly, doesn’t smell. I keep one in my nightstand because I tend to wake a lot in the night, I open the drawer next to me, take a few puffs, in my bed, and I’m usually fast asleep pretty quickly. Vape cartridges last much longer too, and they work fast.",t2_avaypddx,GlitterfreshGore,0,1648999256.0,0,t1_i38czsh,i38czsh,False,crashdude3,t3_tva1ta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/tva1ta/whats_up_with_weed_in_ct/,Whats up with weed in CT?,/r/Connecticut/comments/tva1ta/whats_up_with_weed_in_ct/i38czsh/,8,r/Connecticut,0,8

"Try The Vault. I’m in Ledyard and it’s less than an hour from me.

Edit to add- you’ll need a license or ID that shows you are 21. It’s a very professional place. Can be intimidating. A little. But the drive is nice, it’s not city traffic or anything like that. The place that The Vault is, is like a town just a little smaller than Groton. Just google the directions. I thinks it’s mostly 395N into Mass, and then you’ll follow the directions to a little town. Round trip should take you maybe two hours. I’m not sure about Sundays but they have decent hours, like until 8 or 9.

"West Hartford is awesome.  Although people think its all upper class, it's actually fairly diverse socio-economically and racially.  Much more so than Avon and Simsbury.  The trade off is that you have less land.  You can find some really beautiful spots in Avon and Simsbury for the price of 1/4 acre in West Hartford.

As an investment, I'd keep an eye on the elmwood neighborhood and the west end.  Both are becoming more developed.  Elmwood has its own unique feel with lots of small independent businesses.  My hope is that Hartford continues to develop and gets cooler.

"My friend always tells that she finds the bus system intimidating because there aren't any route maps at the bus stops. You have to know which number bus goes where ahead of time if you want to be able to ride without getting lost. Classic New England, right? You either already know where you're going or you're an outsider who doesn't belong.

There's an app called Moovit that can tell you where each route goes and how soon each bus is arriving but it's pretty new. It used to be you had to navigate the CT transit website and squint at a PDF of the bus routes and hope you were reading it right.

With that in mind, I don't expect that this suspension of bus fare will entice very many people to give up driving, especially since a bus ride is a much slower journey than driving.

"West Hartford (06117 in specific) is about as affluent as Belmont MA (West Hartford is really close to the city of Hartford and Belmont MA is really close to Boston). I am curious why 06117 is considerably cheaper than houses in Belmont (even when property taxes are being adjusted)?

"Hi and welcome :) I live in simsbury. Im not sure where it is you’re comparing the prices to (never heard of west borough but I’m guessing housing is expensive!), but houses in Avon, simsbury, and west hartford are relatively high/competitive at this moment especially compared to other towns surrounding hartford. All three towns are great investments when it comes to housing- especially if you have the ability to keep up with the condition or make upgrades. I would also say all three towns are pretty progressive and welcome diversity! West hartford has quicker access and more amenities. Simsbury has a cute section of town and then the other side of town has close access to RT 44 which is lined with every store, restaurant, food type you need.

"It’s insane and it’s been getting worse. I drove from Danbury to Hartford the other day, and I saw at least 15 different drivers at various points hogging the left lane, either driving slow or pacing the car next to them not letting anyone pass. When a car would come up behind them, not tailgating, still at a safe distance usually a car’s length behind the slow driver, the slow driver would hit the brakes hard and go even slower. When people would try and pass on the right, the slow car would speed up to try to block them. This happened over and over. I have watched the line of cars build behind these slow left lane hogs and watch the people behind them get angrier. I’ve seen road rage caused by these drivers on multiple occasions. I have noticed slow drivers drive right next to semi trucks and not pass, which is incredibly dangerous. The left lane is the passing lane, and traffic should keep right except to pass. However, no one follows that and it’s not enforced as frequently as it should be. Connecticut General Statutes Chapter 248 Section 14-230 goes into this in detail. 

The worst was 2 weeks ago; I was in the middle lane and I saw a slow driver a little way ahead in the left lane that brake checked multiple people, flipped people off, swerved between lanes to block people from passing, sprayed their windshield washer fluid, then sped up to 90 to block people, then slammed the brakes on again. They were road raging everyone. A few miles down the highway after I had passed them, I saw them come flying up in the right lane going probably 90 or more, swerve across the lanes and cut back into the left lane. They then slammed the brakes on, slowed down to about 55 and began pacing next to the car in the middle lane again. Wtf?! It was crazy. This was on 84 eastbound in Southington about 2 weeks ago. 

I see so many drivers like this everyday, and it’s dangerous and crazy. In many states you will get a ticket for this. The left lane is the passing lane, the middle lane is the travel lane, and the right is the slow lane. Last year in NJ I saw 2 state troopers pull people over that were hogging the left lane going slow. I see slow left lane hogs way more in CT than in other states though, and I have driven all throughout the northeast. Recently, I’ve driven in NY and MA in the last month as well as NJ last year, and it’s not quite as bad as CT in terms of left lane hogs.",t2_36a2jzlq,crankygeese,0,1648933555.0,0,t1_i35gbqm,i35gbqm,True,Old-Ad-3268,t3_tsnviv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/tsnviv/can_we_please_talk_about_ct_drivers/,Can we please talk about CT drivers?,/r/Connecticut/comments/tsnviv/can_we_please_talk_about_ct_drivers/i35gbqm/,2,r/Connecticut,0,2

"Years ago, I took down my curtain rods to wash the curtains during spring cleaning.
I had a beagle, Pippin, at the time. Within a couple hours I saw a stink bug, the dog got it. A few minutes later, maybe five more stink bugs. I was like, wtf where are these coming from? Within maybe 20 minutes, I had close to 50 stink bugs in my house. The dog was freaking out, I was freaking out. I determined that when I took down the curtain rod, apparently I had awakened a whole bunch who had overwintered within the rod. In a panic, I grabbed the entire rod and the all the other curtain rods and threw them out into the yard. Grabbed the dog, and went to my dad’s house. When I was brave enough to go back home, I was killing these things for DAYS. Every time I thought it was over, I’d see another somewhere in the house. Easily the worst week of my life lol.

"As others have said, make reservations for hotels and campsites early, even if you choose to stay just outside the park itself. There are numerous companies which provide tours, such as Tauck and Adventures by Disney.  You don't need to book with them, but if you check out the places they go via their websites, that will give you an idea of the really great (and sometimes crowded) places to see.  Decide what is important to you and make sure you do it early in the visit.  There is so much to see that if you leave it to the end you might run out of time.  And if your goal is to see animals in the wild, they tend to be where the people aren't, so the ability to do unplanned stops can make the trip memorable.",t2_m3dvrxc,QuantGeek,0,1648911205.0,0,t1_i343rea,i343rea,True,FuzzyFingerPopper,t3_tu5be5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/tu5be5/anyone_been_to_yellowstone_national_park_need/,Anyone been to Yellowstone National Park?

"I visited once then went back the next year and spent the summer there working and checking out the park about 20+ years ago.  It is an awesome place.  I stayed in the lake lodge area which is great but my favorite part of the park is the Lamar valley area.  I love seeing wildlife and Lamar Valley is said to be the Serengeti of North America.  Yellowstone is huge, it is about 2/3 the size of Connecticut.  There are campgrounds in the park and outside as well.  When we visited once we stayed at a KOA near Jackson Hole that was right on the Snake River.  If you are more into the geology aspects of the park there are hot springs and geysers in many locations through the park like Mammoth Hot Springs in the North (not terribly far from Lamar Valley if I remember correctly), Old Faithful on the West Side and Yellowstone Falls is a sight to see, there are many other features scattered about.  There are many amazing hikes throughout the park and most visitors stay on/close to the roads and main attractions.  If you want to learn stuff while you are there check out Yellowstone Institute.
