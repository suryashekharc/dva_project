"The local music scene in Billings is pretty swell imo. Craft local is a non-profit music venue dedicated to showcasing local artists with great music basically every day of the week.

And the commercial music program at MSU-B is a pretty unique thing, I think. 
There’s also plenty of meaningful work in the non-profit sector, medicine, agriculture, construction, the trades and more in Billings for qualified folks.

"The trail poop around town is awful.

Two days ago, walking down the sidewalk near my house in the residential area west of downtown, a dog (on leash!) literally bit my arm as I walked past it. Fortunately wasn’t a very hard bite but it was enough to leave my wrist aching for the rest of my walk. It happened so quickly I didn’t really process what had happened until the dog and owner had walked by (I questioned my sanity but noticed there was some drool on my coat), and regrettably I didn’t say anything to the owner, but people really need to train their dogs if taking them around other people in public.

(Not to downplay the importance of leashes — obviously they won’t solve all issues but it would certainly help.)

I would definitely be in favor of some kind of off-leash license system with some more aggressive enforcement, especially for poop cleanup.",t2_1h7yz14j,aeiou372372,0,1648757614.0,0,t1_i2w5ew2,i2w5ew2,True,Sea_Meaning_1815,t3_ts7c6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/ts7c6h/keep_your_pet_on_a_leash_please_and_pick_up_the/,Keep your pet on a leash please and pick up the poop,/r/Bozeman/comments/ts7c6h/keep_your_pet_on_a_leash_please_and_pick_up_the/i2w5ew2/,1,r/Bozeman,0,1

"Okay, un-caped crusader. You do you. But to me a passive aggressive gesture is petty. It’s not gentle. It’s a demeaning action that you’re taking as a mission against someone, and involving their property. 

The fact that people have responded poorly to you in the past may not be their issue. It could be how you approached them. Maybe they didn’t see the dog poo. Maybe they’re a jerk. Maybe, again, the way a stranger willing to tie a bag of shit to their car approached them was not the best. 

However, returning from a hike and finding that the Poo Patroller (you workshop your moniker, but that’s free if it fits) has blessed your vehicle with a found turd, is not a “gentle reminder.” It’s an aggressive action that you are undertaking. You’re messing with personal property. I think you should reconsider this action because one day you may offend that unbalanced person who doesn’t connect the dots about this random turd belonging to their canine, and they may wait at the trailhead ready for a fight or worse. 

One thing you are not doing is teaching a lesson. Even if the person connects the dots, they will not learn from your aggression.

"Download any of the aurora forecast apps in the AppStore, and set alerts for KP-6 or above. Now this isn’t a hardest rule as there are other factors in visible northern lights, but at kp-6 they start to get visible. To really see them you’ll want to get out of town (preferably to the north), as at Kp-6 they’ll really be blocked by the bridgers but might start peaking over.

"I don't hike the local trails any more. Dog shit reeks and I end up in a foul mood after I run out of poop bags I brought, and apparently I'm a bad person because I don't enthusiastically say ""Hi!"" to the 509 people I encountered. :P

We got charged by an unleashed ""He's friendly!"" brindled pit mix at Buffalo Jump last year. My 3yo was kneeling on the trail looking at cactus flowers or something and around the corner he came running, no owner in sight. Dog took one look at the small human and immediately changed body language, started stalking, and then charged right for her. I snatched her up by one arm, swung her around, and kicked the dog in the gut. 

Owner finally came up as I'm getting my kid safely on my shoulders to tell me he's friendly, I angrily said ""Is that why he aggressively charged at my kid?"" Fucker said nothing and walked away with his dog, like the encounter never happened.

Poop left behind makes the municipal drinking water unsafe. More poop means we need more chemicals to kill things in our water. Great. 

I'm over lazy pet ownership. Here's how I see it: you're a parent now. You're responsible for your dog, its behavior, and its bodily emissions. 

It shouldn't be a right to own a dog. It should be an immense responsibility, and privilege. Like driving a car. You get a license and insurance. There are sanctioned places you can drive and not drive, and you face serious consequences for not behaving. This is to protect everyone else.

She was sitting on our porch when an unleashed out of control dog ran into OUR yard and onto our porch and tried to attack her. The dog proceeded to chase her to our back yard. I was finally able to catch up to them and the dog cornered her behind the BBQ grill. If she wasn't so small and able to hid behind the BBQ, I am 100% positive this big dog would have killed her. The dog's owner did not apologize and proceeded to tell me that her dog was super friendly and had never done anything like that before. That's the thing dogs are an animal that can be completely unpredictable. Now I don't trust letting our dogs to be in our front yard because there are too many people who walk by with unleashed dogs and I am afraid they will attack our dogs again.",t2_93ae8u8z,MTRunner2020,0,1648662855.0,0,t1_i2qqwdt,i2qqwdt,False,Sea_Meaning_1815,t3_ts7c6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/ts7c6h/keep_your_pet_on_a_leash_please_and_pick_up_the/,Keep your pet on a leash please and pick up the poop,/r/Bozeman/comments/ts7c6h/keep_your_pet_on_a_leash_please_and_pick_up_the/i2qqwdt/,8,r/Bozeman,0,8

"I have off leash hiked with my dogs for 15 years. I always pick up after them, and I had a little spitz that would randomly choose one dog out of 20 we passed to snap at. I quickly leashed him and then trained him with a bark collar. He was no longer aggressive. My dogs have been attacked only once, snapped at a handful of times. Most of my encounters (and we hike at least once a week around here from March- November) have been positive. I think the population explosion and all the people with dogs that haven’t grown up off leash are not being mindful of how their dogs should behave, and it’s their job to leash their dog as soon as they show any aggression. 

The city/county will make all trails leash only or no dogs at all if dog owners don’t step up. That’s what happened in the Denver area.

"Bugs the hell out of me how everyone uses every park as an off-leash area for their dog. So often when I walk by with my leashed dogs, their dogs always come running up. I have my dogs on a leash so I can limit their interactions and teach them not to be fired up when they see another dog. It doesn't matter if ""oh, it's ok, my dog's nice!"" If any bad interaction happens, it's the off-leash dog owner's fault because they're the ones breaking the law and that can't rein in their dog. 

I really wish law enforcement would crack down on people letting their dogs run wild in town. There may be a small number of dogs that are trained well enough, but I see them a lot less often than the ones who do whatever they want and hardly respond when the owner is yelling at them repeatedly to come back. The unfortunate truth is that most people don't put in the time and effort with their dogs to teach them proper behavior and recall.",t2_dgt931j,newnameonan,0,1648654965.0,0,t1_i2q6yu1,i2q6yu1,True,Sea_Meaning_1815,t3_ts7c6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/ts7c6h/keep_your_pet_on_a_leash_please_and_pick_up_the/,Keep your pet on a leash please and pick up the poop,/r/Bozeman/comments/ts7c6h/keep_your_pet_on_a_leash_please_and_pick_up_the/i2q6yu1/,35,r/Bozeman,0,35

"Im sorry you're having a bad experience!

Is it an off leash area (that is, if you're near town)? Then you might have a hard time fighting this one. If you live outside of the official city of Bozeman (like the Sypes trailhead) you're also going to have a really hard time enforcing anything because there is a strong off-leash dog culture in Bozeman when heading into the mountains. 

People should certainly pick up their dog poop. Unfortunately this is really hard to enforce, but it makes everything nicer when you don't have to watch where you step all of the time. I personally love the off-leash culture here and have never witnessed major faux pas from dog owners or dogs. I've heard of a couple aggressive incidents, but generally, dogs here are more comfortable and better trained at being off leash than other places I've been to or lived.

For lurkers thinking about moving to bozeman: the trails here are super dog friendly and we have a lot of amazing dog parks. Good luck with housing though!

"Good points, yes.

\> those new owners that will be hit with higher prices and higher taxes   
are far less likely to actually make the jump to purchasing a home

yabbut, when I moved to California in '99 or so, I was able to buy a little home I could afford, and I made a boatload of remodeling improvements and didn't have to pay for it in the property tax department ....till I sold the place several years later. The buyer was well able to afford ""my improvements"" and saw it as a lovely boost of real estate value -- which I could actually afford to do because I didn't get gouged for property taxes like I would have for the same situation had it been in Oregon instead of California ....

**Oregon has no sales tax.**

"Not good for the local taxing jurisdictions or the state and will result in underfunded schools. Unless of course the lost revenue is made up elsewhere. Increased business and agricultural taxes being most likely. So that will get passed on in increased prices for the services and goods from those properties. Alternatively, you can follow the California model and implement a regressive increased sales tax of over 5% after changing property taxes. 

As an added bonus those new owners that will be hit with higher prices and higher taxes are far less likely to actually make the jump to purchasing a home unless relocating or investing for short-term profits because they won’t be able to actually upgrade their standard of living by the time they factor in all the extra increases. 

The systems in place and proposed are riddled with problems for homeowners, small business owners and farmers and ranchers. But they are great for centrally-assessed property owners that are large multi-state corporations most often that appeal their values and pay significantly lower taxes proportionally to ordinary folks. However, that problem is unlikely to be solved thanks the the armies of lobbyists for those businesses in Helena, mountains of campaign cash, and the lawyers that will get rich fighting any changes.

"yes indeedy. In 50+ years of driving I managed to grease one squirrel and one small mule deer (neither of which were in Montana).

As most of us cynical folks might expect, bunnykissers and treehuggers just came out of the woodwork objecting to this ""unnecessary tree killing"" .............  it was a long time ago (so you poised downvoters just sit still for a minute here) but it actually turned into a DOT action that saved the lives of a lotta mule deer and a lotta humans in cars on the snowy interstate highway.

"Sure. So I have a Long Range (74 kWh) 2018 Model 3.

Range takes a big hit in the winter. My ""310 miles"" of range (which is a bit optimistic even in the summer) can be 200 miles or less in the winter. I've heard electric cars with heat pumps can be more efficient in the cold.

Level 1 charging (120 V, 12 A) outdoors, which can do 30% in 20 hours in the summer, might only charge 10% in 20 hours when it is well below freezing. Level 2 charging (240 V, 32+ A) is not significantly impacted because there is enough power available to heat the battery and charge the car.

The biggest issue on my Model 3 is that there is no way for heat to reach the windshield wipers. In order to be more aerodynamic they are tucked low under the hood a little bit, below the bottom of the windshield. If there is ice on the windshield wipers, it just never melts off.

Additionally the frameless windows, door handles, and charge port cover all freeze up and get stuck. As a result I have bent/scratched trim around my door, and my charge port cover broke last winter to the point where I had to open/close it by hand and it didn't seal correctly until it was fixed by Tesla Service. Tesla has released a few software updates that partially address these issues. This includes software changes to not roll the windows all the way up in the winter (but still fully sealing), and not locking the charge port in freezing temperatures.

Thankfully I do keep my car inside a garage most of the time, and I do have 240 V power available in my garage so I can charge my car every day and I can pre-heat my car using wall power. If I did not have a garage and a car charger at home, I would consider the design issues of my Tesla Model 3 to be a dealbreaker and would not recommend buying this car in areas that get heavy snow in the winter. However the Model 3 is my only car, so if you have a second car that may be fine.

Also, Tesla Service is kinda awful. Bozeman is technically covered by Mobile service, based out of the Boise service center. But there is no way to contact them. Service is all managed through the app and it only connects to the service centers not Mobile Service. Tesla's phone trees are impossible to navigate. I have had mobile service visit a couple times and they have been great. However for a larger issue where the car was un-driveable I had to have the car towed to Salt Lake (which insurance covered), and then drive it back.",t2_14ok9r,RexKoeck,0,1648563856.0,0,t1_i2kfz25,i2kfz25,False,licorice_root,t3_tbj89s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bozeman/comments/tbj89s/electric_vehicle_experience/,Electric Vehicle Experience?,/r/Bozeman/comments/tbj89s/electric_vehicle_experience/i2kfz25/,2,r/Bozeman,0,2

I \*screamed\* in his waiting room in my mom's arms for a half hour straight waiting for help. The pain was unbearable. No exaggeration. 30 minutes sustained screaming.

I assume he was ""in surgery"" but not great there wasn't some sort of backup option or ability to schedule an emergency 30s shot. Esp when my numbing had already worn off clearly in office, mighta seen this one coming. 

Once numbed again, I was able to get back on track with different painkillers and ride out the rest of the recovery okay but it was brutal there for a bit, and I really felt they could have handled my case better.

"Please be bear aware. They didn’t go too much into the story, sounds like two people split up, stick together please. 

For people who are new to the Bozeman area or are wanting to experience all of the hiking around here, you are not at the top of the food chain as soon as you step foot into the woods. Bear spray (Costco 2 for $40) is a must and/or a firearm if you’re comfortable AND HAVE PRACTICED, bear spray is more humane and cheaper, both give you a snowballs chance with a grizz.

Stick to high populated trails to limit encounters. The closer to the Yellowstone you get the more there are. From what I’ve heard and researched grizzly hang out in the south Gallatin range on the west side of paradise valley, most of the Absaroka range (where the hiker was hiking) and most of the Beartooth range (there is a reason they are named the Beartooth range). AND the dude who got attacked over by Ennis a few years ago.

The Bozeman Grizzly Encounter off exit 319 will get you started on grizzly info and the respect they require when you’re in their house.

"See this is what I figured you were referring to (or someplace close to town like it) when you said trails, because it's so popular. Bozeman Creek/Sourdough Canyon does _not_ require leashes. GVLT was responsible for making the trailhead, so here is the primary source on that:

Confusingly, and just to be clear, there is also a Sourdough Trail on the south side of Bozeman that _does_ require leashes:

I suppose my overall point is that leash rules are a mixed bag, especially once you leave the city limits. Just because you see some off leash dogs on a trail close to Bozeman doesn't mean that anyone is breaking the rules. If you're out of city limits at all, dogs can even be off leash on roads. I also think there are absolutely a lot of places where people ignore leash laws, or are potentially legitimately ignorant of them.
