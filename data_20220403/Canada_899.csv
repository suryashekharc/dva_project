"“Justice for black people will not flow into this society merely from court decisions nor from fountains of political oratory…White America must recognize that justice for black people cannot be achieved without radical changes in the structure of our society,” King wrote in an essay published in 1969 titled “A Testament of Hope.” In his 1958 book Stride Toward Freedom, he wrote, “True peace is not merely the absence of tension; it is the presence of justice.” 

The “I don’t not see colour” people cling on to the first part tightly so they ignore the second part. 

King said that many white people, even well-meaning people, think that equality means Black people have to improve.

 King referred to discriminatory treatment of Black people by police saying, “We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.”

MLK made many speeches, wrote many letters, the over fixation of just that one is an issue and the easiest copout ever.

"Some could argue that the 50% Sale of Hydro One by the previous government (Wynn/Liberals) caused a reduction in positive cash flow for Ontario, causing the next government (Ford/Conservative) to make spending cuts.

To be fair, we waste a lot of money to bureaucracy across the board. There needs to be serious reductions in red tape (and not another division tasked with cutting red tape). Some social spending should be cut if it's shown to be ineffective/inefficient, foreign aid in the form of cash should be massively cut back.

The issue is nobody wants to be the one to cause severe austerity measures that will actually help our economy rebound stronger, instead they just make more debt, spend more money, so that future generations will be stuck paying more interest on that debt, and have to take out even more debt, or enact even more severe austerity measures",t2_8sf0v,Moistened_Nugget,0,1649001533.0,0,t1_i38ibqk,i38ibqk,False,uselesspoliticalhack,t3_tuo4ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/tuo4ua/chrystia_freeland_readies_another_bigspending/,Chrystia Freeland readies another big-spending federal budget amid fears of rising inflation,/r/canada/comments/tuo4ua/chrystia_freeland_readies_another_bigspending/i38ibqk/,1,r/canada,0,1

"> Gasoline doesn't explode.... You continue to prove you don't know what you are talking about. The only time gasoline explodes is if its a high concentration of vapour/gaseous form.

You mean a leaking gas tank after a car accident where there is a spark plug going off? Do you know how many people die every year form gasoline fires from car accidents? 

Gasoline is a very dangerous product. It's flash point is -23 so it can easily catch fire from let's say a spark or even a tiny little fire. If you are comparing it to lithium I'd say risk is comperable. 

Whats safer than both is [desiel](https://youtu.be/7soVqyGq4i4) it's flash point is 55 degrees. But we long ago ditched desiel for gasoline for commuters so this isn't even a point of discussion for commuters cars. 

> No you need a special can because gasoline eats away at plastics. So unless you have a properly rated storage vessel it'll leak out and start producing fumes because it's vapour point is fairly low.

Did you read the links? Also if your fuel tank after a crash is leaking what do you suppose will happen 

> A phone battery that weighs less then a pound or a battery weighing typically over 20? Do you understand how fire works. It needs a fuel source, small battery small fire, small time. Big battery big fire very very very hard to put out.

> It also fails in the cold, long haul driving,

My dad lives in Calgary and drives his tesla around everywhere. 350 km range drops to about 250-375 on those very cold -40 wind chill days. 

Average commute is about 50 km there and back. Even if the fall in range is more than 50 percent that's still more than enough to get your through the a week. 

 > charging stations don't scale as well as gas stations

Not necessary you charge at home which what my dad does. He comes home plugs the car in and overnight gets a full charge using 110 and within an hour using 240 volts. 

> Most homes infrastructure doesn't support it is older.

My dad charges his using a standard 240 NEMA socket. You know the same one you plug your stove into or your dryer. Most older homes have a dryer and the grid is able to handle those fine.

Also a for commuting 110 volt socket will recharge the car overnight perfectly fine.

> our province doesn't produce enough power for everybody to have a ev.

See above about dryers and stoves. Why didn't the grid collapse from electric stoves and dryers?

I've seen most of this estimates and they are based on people draining a 350 km battery every night and then it DC fast charge every night. 

Also most EV chargers are smart. If they notice it's late in the day they will trickle charger the battery. 

Also I live in Vancouver now and I'd say about 40 percent of the cars in some neighbourhoods are EVs. Our grid has not collapses from EVs. 

Yes if everyone plugged in their EV every night for a full 250 volt charge DC fast charge to charge up our cars from 0 to 350 kms our grid would collapse. 

Same is also true if we all turned on our dryers at the same and kept them running all night or electric stoves. But that's not what happens. 

Same EVs. Out of 10,000 people in a given area 9,999 will come home and plug their car in to replenish what was lost in a one or two day commute. The charger will likely trickle charge or at most level 2 charge that overnight. That'll put a load comperable to a Dryer running for an hour on the grid. 

1 person in 10,000 per day might need DC fast charging yes that guy will put a massive load on the grid. But that load will last for an hour at most. Then the car will revert to level 2 charging. 

Btw want to know what puts even more load on the grid than an EV. Air conditioners especially for big tall buildings. Places like Toronto and Montreal people run those all day and the grid hasn't collapsed. 

> long haul driving,

So most people don't do this daily for them it's not even a factor. 

For the people who do this regularly Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) will still be available. They have a 50-75 km battery and 500 km gasoline electric  generator or gasoline ice engine. 

The car works by draining the battery first and then kicks in the gasoline engine or generator when necessary.

Daily commute most people would not use the EV

>  What about people who park on the street.

We literally have block heaters in Alberta and people who park on the street have had no problem plugging their cars in the winter. 

It's literally the same thing, ok you won't get DC fast charging but its ok for your average commutes. You sleep for 8 hours in that time you'll get a full charge. 

Also can I point out street parking is a thing done mostly in older neighbourhoods in cities. Which also tend to have the following: street lights, and now electric parking meters. 

There already tech being rolled out in Canada which converts both of those into level 2 charting.  Cities can deploy those and recoup the cost by charging drivers for its use. 

> Sigh. I assume you have no idea how expensive something like this would be. Electricity at low voltage doesn't travel far without losing power. That's why we step up the power from the dams to 255000? Something stupid like that to transmit it to the cities

Did you watch the video. They are able to recoup the costs in 10 years by charging the drivers for using the electricity. 

> Trans can operate because of the fact they are in the middle of the city, they have very very easy access to transformers and power infrastructure required to do this. Next time your walking down in Vancouver where the buses have the wires look at how they're connected to the power.

"> Under the program, news media organizations are eligible for refundable tax credits, a non-refundable tax credit for subscriptions to Canadian digital news and access to charitable tax incentives for not-for-profit journalism.

It's a program designed to encourage people to subscribe more to news outlets. Like local papers and shit like that. You can then write that on your taxes, I think it would help you lower taxes if you have to pay money back.

Look how easy this was to do. I mean, do you read articles or headlines? I'm not going to link you jack shit, you don't believe me.. well, go do a journalism yourself. You can copy and paste that quote in a search engine.

"Okay lets look at things from a different angle here

Number 1. I couldn't find much information on the profile but it doesn't sound all that crazy from my perspective considering that in order to be on tv you already need to sign a release form. I'd assume that, since there's no direct mention of if the people being interviewed are the ones to fill it out, that it's the staff that are most likely filling it out. 

Now I've done surveys before, unless they're doing an essay on the person they interviewed, jotting down information about a person (probably online, and from a premade form no less) should take maybe 5-10 minutes at most. And if you dont have 10 minutes to make a profile about someone you've interviewed for your companies records then that speaks to a clearly overworked and understaffed staff.

Number 2. Sounds like....journalism, running a background check on your guest before they arrive sounds par for the course to me. Especially since guests are usually public figures who's information isn't hard to discern. Why waste air-time to fuel your curiosity? Especially since this point says nothing about it being mandatory. I'm assuming if the guest speakers race/nationality/gender etc. is important to the story then it would be mentioned and expanded upon. Otherwise if you as a journalist are curious then ya, research it yourself.

Number 3. This point seems redundant, if you already have to fill out a profile on everyone who is on the cbc wouldn't them being biracial be on there? Whats the point of mentioning this? Is it on a separate form? Jot down on sticky notes? Why the need to differentiate this?

Idk I read the article and listened to the interview and it all sounds rather contrived. They just kept repeating that we, ""need more diverse viewpoints"" and that, ""all they care about is race, but considering the fact that the only thing said about race is, ""hey we document it."" Well shit then i guess we live in 1984 or something.

"studies have shown more wolves actually mean a healthier ecosystem overall as prey overpopulation (boom bust) is a thing and without predators they consume everything without check at the detriment of everything else. ecosystems here NEED wolves, and they are more stable, diverse, and healthy then without them. There is no such thing as ""too many wolves"" as ecosystems with them naturally hit the ideal amount.

"> ""He told me: 'If you can't f--king speak English — if you can't understand English — then why would you even work in this industry?'"" said Jaymaylin, who is now the chairperson of Anakbayan Toronto, a Filipino youth organization.

I dont know how I feel about this.  I'm not sure should I even go ahead with this comment as I'm sure what kind of reactions it will get. However, I think that qualitative review of what is going on is important because this particular case is a symptom of something that some people try to present as ""off the shelf racism"". 

I honestly thought highlight case would be something we see in US where a random person simply attacks an Asian person, violently and with no restraint. The kind of stuff you see on some specialized subreddits.

As for the paragraph quotes, in one hand, it is inexcusable for a grown person to act like this, any form of unwarranted aggression is just not called for. 

On the other hand, this particular case, while only verbally aggressive, to me, it distills the frustration that is a symptom of something nobody wants to talk about. Again, not excusing the behaviour but certainly can see the dynamic where a seemingly average person is brought to the level of frustration to lash out like this. 

Are we supposed to be so conformed to any societal change ""for our own good"" that we are wiling - or, more likely, shamed - into accepting anything these days? Is this what our society is going to become? A bunch of ever  culturally and socially divergent individuals where it takes more effort to prepare for inter-personal  transaction than it takes for  the transaction itself to happen?

>and it's racist to assume we all think alike.

Ahh yes. Who’s putting words in whose mouth again?

>The article even mentions that hunting this caribou is not a legal right given to them, and explicitly says they did not have experts there (who would have to travel by foot) and thus were not told of the abnormally low population density there.

Uhhh that’s a very charitable interpretation of events unless my translation is way off.

>Recent hunting expeditions on the North Shore occur in a particular context. Last January, a 28-year-old man from the community of Nutashkuan was convicted of killing four woodland caribou in 2016.

>The trial had mobilized the entire community, which had asserted, before Judge François Paré, his ancestral right.

>Tristan Malek, a logger and fishing guide, admitted to slaughtering the four caribou to feed elders, friends and family.

Given the fact there was a high profile case about killing 4 of them in 2016, I think the community is aware. Especially since they’re being investigated for being involved in the deaths of 30 caribou from last season.

"Well, let's go further, then, and talk about his book where he details what he feels is the solution to the race problem in the US, *Where Do We Go From Here,* where he proposes a broad spectrum, non-racially limited suite of anti-poverty programs for the entire country as his solution.

To paraphrase his argument from the book, there was 3-4 times as many poor white people in the US in the 1960s as there was poor black people. He understood the difference between 'over-represented' and 'solely represented' and so proposed a program to raise all boats at the same time. Unifying cause for the poor had all sorts of benefits that he could see and made allies of people that would have otherwise been across the racial divide from each other.

Now ... why do you think he would propose something like this? Maybe he saw the grander scheme, that we're all human, and any attempt to ONLY help black people was going to be one more piece to foster the divide rather than bridge it.

"Then you obviously don't understand what a genocide is.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/genocide-case-inquiry-1.5160941

""It was an ""inescapable conclusion"" that genocide was committed against Canada's Indigenous peoples, said Marion Buller, the chief commissioner for the National Inquiry into Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls, during a Monday news conference.

That conclusion has been reverberating across the country since news first surfaced on Friday that the inquiry had determined that thousands of those women and girls were victims of a ""Canadian genocide.""

The final report said Canada, from its pre-colonial past to today, has aimed to ""destroy Indigenous peoples.""

""Canada has displayed a continuous policy, with shifting expressed motives but an ultimately steady intention, to destroy Indigenous peoples physically, biologically, and as social units, thereby fulfilling the required specific intent element,"" said a supplemental report.

The inquiry based this partly on the UN's 1948 definition of genocide. According to the UN, genocide is any of five acts committed with the ""intent to destroy in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group."" The acts are:

Killing members of the group.
Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.
Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.
Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.
Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
""The Canadian state was founded on colonial genocidal policies that are inextricably linked to Canada's contemporary relationship with Indigenous peoples,"" said the supplementary report.

""Modern Canadian policies perpetuate these colonial legacies, and have resulted in clear patterns of violence and marginalization of Indigenous peoples, particularly women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA (two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, intersex and asexual).""

""The inquiry argues that the genocide continues through the over-apprehension of children in the child welfare system, the lack of police protection for Indigenous women and the continued existence of the Indian Act, first enacted in 1876.

""In addition to the premeditated killing of Indigenous peoples, there existed egregious colonial policies that caused serious bodily and mental harm to Indigenous peoples and deliberately inflicted conditions of life on Indigenous communities calculated to bring about their physical destruction,"" said the supplementary report.""

The intent absolutely was genocide and the report has made it quite clear. You should educate yourself on the topic rather than spread misinformation because you're either uninformed about the topic or naive enough to think that wasn't the main goal.

"Meh it is very easy to think that way when you don’t know any better. I used to think like that for the majority of my life. I felt it was unfair that they got free university while I had to take on student debt, got to hunt at times I didn’t (and bag more), and got tax breaks. 

I decided to do some travelling to northern areas and read some more acedemic books on the history of indigenous people in Canada, (specifically the Cree, I cannot say I’m super familiar with the western peoples) and it massively flipped my perspective. I had the advantage of growing up with so much information readily available (age 41 here) so I could explore these topics. This is something the older generations didn’t have the advantage of, so I try not to hold it against them.

Now I just roll my eyes when I see someone getting offended that they are using “modern technology”. They were always using the best technology available to them, like almost any other group of people through time.

"> It's easy, because your compensation ought to be tied to how much value you create (effort x productivity), and as a business owner who provides the resources for others to work and thus increases their productivity, they are entitled to a percentage of the value that is created as a result.

I feel that this is a pretty skewed way to look at things though. I work at a business wherein the partners manage the high level tasks of running the business, but then delegate pursuing new contracts and then the actual management and productivity to others. They are reliant on their staff to ""create value"" because their staff are the ones actually producing. 

You say business owners ""provides the resources for others to work"" as though this is some great task, when really it's budgeted into their billing rates and then actually administered by others (staff accountants, office managers, project managers). 

Yet despite all of that, they earn far more than their staff do just by merit of owning the business. So in that regard, in my opinion, their enrichment is disproportionate and should arguably be lower than it is.

To your last point, I agree with what you're saying. However I don't think small business owners are uniformly angels in the way they operate. They may be just as guilty of exploiting their staff and benefiting from the corporate culture you're describing. They are just more likely to be on the chopping block than a huge company that can carry losses for longer or have more ability to pressure labour.",t2_gv0w4,a_sense_of_contrast,0,1648999981.0,0,t1_i38enxd,i38enxd,False,MelodicBerries,t3_turo7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/turo7o/canada_just_saw_the_biggest_q4_for_residents/,Canada Just Saw The Biggest Q4 For Residents Permanently Leaving Since The 1970s - Better Dwelling,/r/canada/comments/turo7o/canada_just_saw_the_biggest_q4_for_residents/i38enxd/,1,r/canada,0,1

"My comment was specifically trying to point out that it's not just owning a business being discussed but also working. I don't know why we keep coming back to purely business owning.

Also your question is both easy and difficult to answer. It's easy, because your compensation ought to be tied to how much value you create (effort x productivity), and as a business owner who provides the resources for others to work and thus increases their productivity, they are entitled to a percentage of the value that is created as a result. Relative levels don't actually matter from a fairness point of view.

"I mean...... I thought you would have picked a difficult one but okay.

>The Oxford dictionary defines a coalition as a “temporary alliance of political parties.” Similar definitions are found with Merriam-Webster, Collins and Dictionary.com to name just a few. They all describe what the Liberals and the NDP are doing, working together to advance an agenda.

His definition is absolutely correct and its great he knows how to use a dictionary. Too bad it is only used to cherry pick things for his own need.

Coalitions in Canada are formed against majority governments so while his definition is accurate, the nuance is what is missing.

> There is nothing illegal about this and it is how our system works, though the optics won’t sit well with many Canadians.

Like who? It is a staple of Lilly's writing to paint anything to do with anything left of conservative as divisive without actually saying anything, he wants you to feel like the everyday joe is going to hate this.

>The Liberals and the NDP have agreed to consult behind closed doors on many fronts and in many ways that actually goes against Parliamentary norms and procedures and is bad for Canada’s democracy.

Sounds super spooky, unfortunately in Canada we also have this weird part of our government that anything the house tries to pass has to make it through the senate.

The NDP and Libs can jerk eachother off in Lilly's mind all he wants. It still needs to pass the Senate and then finally the GG. Both of which can and have sent legislation back as well. It also has a number of tries before the bill is just simply kicked out.

Checks and Balances, what a concept.

>The UnParliamentary Procedure

A scary subtitle to make sure you know how bad this really is. Even though it isn't.

""BUT HOW!"" I hear you say

Easy, because now he is going to tell us what his problem is:

> Yes, in order to deal with the fact that some Canadians don’t have prescription drug coverage, we will now have to pay for the prescriptions of everyone in the country, even if they are covered.

Because Socialism is apparently bad even though we all love OHIP and reap the benefits of it ten fold. Increase that if you have a family member that has been in critical care or needed cancer treatments.

>Royal Bank CEO David McKay earned more than $13 million last year. Do we really need to have the government paying for whatever pills he’s popping?

This part was kind of funny simply because Lilly is in Ford's pocket and has enjoyed the perks of being in a relationship with Yelich, but it is only because it is to get people who don't think on his side.

Yes absolutely our tax dollars also would pay for McKay's drugs, that is exactly how our OHIP works as well.

I don't believe that Joe Blow working construction also pays the same tax bracket as McKay and would never be able to. So it isn't like McKay is getting a great deal here. 

I'm sure Lilly just casually forgot about how taxation works in this province and country. ~~I'm sure~~

>As someone who has covered federal politics for a long time, the government has trouble purchasing anything properly from fighter jets to light bulbs. So putting them in charge of buying all your prescriptions and running the system sounds like a recipe for disaster.

Again this almost gets to some semblance of truth and I have to say I nearly fainted when I read this.

Nearly.

The government's purchasing issues especially related to COVID was in large part due to the Harper government's slashing of federal funding to research councils. 

I will leave the googling to you on this as it is the easiest part to look into as they were deep cuts and not at all hidden. Especially after COVID and vaccine production was such an issue the past few years.

The Sun gets off on painting the idea of ""Liberalism is bad"" because their readers are conservative based and (unfortunately) woefully undereducated.

Conservative governments (at least prior to Harper's second round) will typically run initiatives to help small businesses ^and ^give ^major ^tax ^breaks ^to ^large ^corporations ^which ^doesn't ^help ^the ^average ^person.

That is nowhere near the case with what is currently lining the Conservative caucus both federally and provincially.

Both benches are lined with religious fanatics who are less worried about reinforcing the idea of the perfect family through tax credits and are more worried about immigration, homosexuality and (still for some weird reason) abortion because it violates their insane Christian values.

Absolutely, taxes will go up, but if that is the only thing people are worried about:

Your tax dollars will not go up higher than the paying of the visit to the dentist or if you are on prescription medication that you need to live.

Furthermore, while you may nor directly benefit from those tax dollars, you may need those benefits later on if you are in say a car accident, have a health issue, or worse, you have kids and they need access to those programs.",t2_cy17v,adorablesexypants,0,1648997448.0,0,t1_i388xez,i388xez,False,resting16,t3_tuwwsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/tuwwsx/furey_the_trudeau_liberals_remain_obsessed_with/,FUREY: The Trudeau Liberals remain obsessed with censoring Internet,/r/canada/comments/tuwwsx/furey_the_trudeau_liberals_remain_obsessed_with/i388xez/,1,r/canada,0,1

History class in elementary school was basically just a rehash of “the pioneers and how they lived” for the entirety of elementary school. Barely talking about their relationship with native peoples and especially downplaying any and all acts of aggression or atrocities we committed.

History is extremely poorly taught in this country and most people with interest either learn in university or are “self taught” on their own time as a hobby.

That said, I disagree with the article. You can recognize a guy for his accomplishments and also realize he was probably a shit person by modern standards.

"What we need is a conservative party that could actually conceivably win an election and I think that means abandoning the CPC and starting a new party directed at being socially liberal and fiscally conservative. The current CPC has too much baggage and it's clear that Canada is a far more left leaning country, too left for Cons to win.

They're also in a death spiral where they can't accept that Canada is a more left leaning country so they keep blaming their leaders for their failings meaning the party spends too much time criticizing its self which just weakens their positions further.

There's honestly no saving the CPC at this point but if they reform and focus on a more left social policy with a conservative fiscal policy and focus on reforms that the liberals haven't been able to get through (like fixing FPTP and engaging the non-voters more) they might stand a chance. But looking at the numbers from the last election 33.12% voted liberal + 15.98% voted NDP means that 49.1% of voters voted left wing compared to 34.34% for right wing. It doesn't look good.

"I'm not saying anything. This article states: ""Reports of racist incidents in Canada increased by 47% last year over 2020, survey suggests""

That is a clear increase. What are you creating a ""50 years ago"" straw man when literally the first line of the article says ""..over 2020"".

If the article said, ""Reports of racist incidents against white people in Canada increased by 47% last year over 2020"" it would be equally concerning. So why downplay and dismiss a very real increase in racist incidents against non-whites?

We all saw (and can google) the anti-Asian hate that spread after Donald Trump continued to called Covid ""the China flu"". We've all seen the hate flowing from right wing groups toward black, indigenous, people of colour, Muslims, Jewish people, and the LGBTQ+ community. 

All domestic security agencies in Canada and the USA report the greatest domestic threat is right wing extremism.

"The increased rate applies equally to everyone, and it’s almost universally worse in investing to buy a property outright rather then take a mortgage. Normally you’d put ~10% down for a mortgage and due to how cheap they currently are the value of the land grows much faster then the monthly cost of the mortgage, then they turn around and get a [Home Equity Line of Credit](https://www.investopedia.com/mortgage/heloc/) which allows them to borrow *more* money against the value of their existing property to then reinvest *back* into a dirt cheap mortgage with a fraction as down payment.

"Ehhh...  I am building a house in Calgary with my own money, having lived on my own for 17 years. A good job and the stock market got me there. 

Everything has gotten more expensive, but it's not just monetary policy that has got us there:

1) The temporary foreign workers program has been dead for 2 years. Employees have to pay local people more and actually compete on wages. Of course, business is screaming bloody murder right now. They have to pass these costs on, however. But, it is a more fair cost of labor, and Canada is near full employment.

2) Inflation

a) Most inflation we are currently seeing  is caused by shortages in goods or transportation as opposed to a change in buying power of the currency. I work in technical equipment sales and shipping has gone up 30%. My suppliers have their shipping up. Materials have gone up because of the current wave of building and economic transition. We would be in a boom time if not for the shortage of materials and logistics.

b) New workers aren't going into trucking or trades. The education system has communicated that these are undesirable jobs. This has reduced supply in areas that can't be automated while still providing cheap labor for retail which could be automated.

TLDR: it's not the monetary policy. If anything, the monetary policy is helping curb inflation by providing capital for the production of goods and establishment of more services in the private sector.",t2_luziw,IcarusOnReddit,0,1648994455.0,0,t1_i382ity,i382ity,False,uselesspoliticalhack,t3_tuo4ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/tuo4ua/chrystia_freeland_readies_another_bigspending/,Chrystia Freeland readies another big-spending federal budget amid fears of rising inflation,/r/canada/comments/tuo4ua/chrystia_freeland_readies_another_bigspending/i382ity/,1,r/canada,0,1

"This line always gets me, like here is the nationalist logic in Quebec.

Quebec nationalist: ""English people in Quebec are a minority the best treated minority in the world by the way.""

English Quebecois: ""Ok then why are you enacting laws that will literally eviscerate my language and culture, under the guise of protecting yours? Is this type of behavior contingent of a culture that is the best treated, sounds kinda stupid""

Quebec nationalist: ""Well we French people are the true minority in Canada and you the majority so fuck off, we need protections you don't if you need services etc. in English just move to another province""

English Quebecois: ""But we're all Canadian no? Shouldn't we try and treat each other with equity and respect and perhaps not have the state intervene on everything that exists inside our country from the words we speak to the schools we attend?""

Quebec nationalist: ""Quebec is different and distinct, the ROC doesn't understand us. Quebec needs to decide its own destiny and make its own laws even if those laws violate the constitution of Canada and Quebec, because that is what is right to protect the French culture the only minority that matters."" 

English Quebecois: ""Ok, so if Quebec decides its own destiny and ignores anything the ROC has to say about anything, how can it think of its English citizens that they can go fuck themselves and just move to Canada and deserve to be treated as second class citizens here in Quebec, where they are the minority (the best treated in the world of course) furthermore what about native Americans do they get special treatment and laws in your new language dogma""

Quebec nationalist: ""No they don't, they are a minority here and don't deserve special treatment. In fact the glorious leader will make sure that they do not attend English school, even if that is their desire!""

English Quebecois: ""Damn man, it's starting to sound like you hate minorities 
(In Quebec you are the super majority, but who is actually counting, that's hard) that aren't you, do you think it is possible that you are just bias, maybe a little prejudice, probably would like it if all other cultures just--especially languages-- disappeared from Quebec because of how hateful you are?""

Quebec nationalist: ""What! how dare you say that I hate people, in Quebec we love everyone and embrace other cultures from around the world, we treat the English majority minority maybe majority minority @##$!#@#!@@#!#! whoa sorry where was I, yes we treat the English people as the best treated people anywhere on earth!""

English Quebecois: ""Oh, the same minority that is not allowed to have a sign that is written in English and if it is it must be much ^smaller ^because ^of ^reasons? The one where with these new laws working in English is going to be almost impossible?

Quebec nationalist: ""Yes, of course best treated in the world!"" 

English Quebecois: ""The same where you banned their music from government elevators for fuck sake and encouraged businesses to do the same? 
The same minority where you have to have special documents to allow you to go to English school?, we are talking about the same people that have a literal language police in Quebec to make sure that no one writes or speaks English too much in public?...........(of course with Quebec's generosity we are allowed to speak in the privacy of our own homes god, so  generous) 
The same minority that will soon be forced to take three French courses in CEGEP, the same people who might lose their jobs and prospects because of this new law, the same that will not be able to get into a good university because their average dropped because of these new rules?
The same who are now told explicitly that their language doesn't exist as an official language in this province?
The same minority that the government of Quebec thought necessary to allow the OQLF to do warrant-less search and seizures of company equipment, for the sole purpose of making sure that English is not being used?????

Quebec nationalist: ""Yes the very same""

English Quebecois: ""Wow I would hate to see how bad other minorities are treated in the world compared to here, I imagine that some are not allowed to hold any government positions or jobs, even teachers because of the way they look or clothes they wear, I'm so happy that it doesn't happen here, so truly enlightened you are....""

Quebec nationalist: ""Now we understand each other Quebecois are the most tolerant, generous people of the earth to minorities, now don't let the door hit you on your way out"".

"My parents still have moose meat I raid from their freezer from his hunt like 3 *years* ago in the interlakes. Meanwhile where we live in MB our own moosehunt has been shut down for over a decade already!

My dad gripes about even my nephews being able to technically hunt whenever they want because of Metis status, but it's like, that's just an opportunity for you to teach your grand kids about hunting, doing it sustainably, etc and something to actually do with your grand kids since he is a terrific hunter himself.

I think lots of white hunters take is as a personal offence the Nations get to do this or that, but it's like, nothing is stopping you from organizing and vouching for change and access yourself, or approaching the first nations trackers you know, too since he knows plenty of trappers.

Wonder what the solution is to not step on the toes of treaty rights but also develop some kind of system that better conserves the herds overall, or *if* there is a way.

I was way up north past Thompson for work last week and didn't see a moose/caribou at all, which I was wanting to see just to send a pic too my friends in europe.
