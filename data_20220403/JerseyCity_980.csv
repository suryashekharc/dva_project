"Come on friend. We both know there is zero correlation in NJ politics between someone’s competence and their ability to be re-elected. His machine has survived for so long for the same reason the Sacco, Vainieri, DeGise, Payne, Kean, you name it machine has survived: they manipulate and cajole people into being beholden to them and manipulate the law and the electoral system to entrench their power.

“Low crime and pretty clean” are basically the definition of broken windows theory. Things sure look nice in UC, but it’s a thin veneer that covers up the same rot and misery present in every municipality around here. Stack didn’t do this because he’s fundamentally benevolent, it’s because it guarantees his he won’t have an opposition because “he gets things done” in the same way a mafia boss does, just without murdering people (that we know).

Stack just makes you feel good about him being a dictator but that’s the same as people who say Mussolini was a great guy because “he made the trains run on time”. There are people in Medellin, Colombia who think Pablo Escobar was a wonderful human being because he handed out his cocaine money to the poor hand over fist. Authoritarians do this to convince people that they’re a benevolent monarch, and discredit critics.

It’s all fine and dandy to have your criticisms of JC and Fulop and all, but when your standard is the average Hudson mayor, just being perceived as giving a shit seems like a big deal. 

If UC won’t be a working class immigrant community for long, it’ll be because of Brian Stack not in spite of him.",t2_8z8a0xbi,6438eke,0,1649009707.0,0,t1_i3928d8,i3928d8,False,jinxcaitlyn,t3_tuun1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/tuun1n/why_jersey_city_streetsroads_sucks_so_much/,why Jersey City streets/roads sucks so much compared to union city?,/r/jerseycity/comments/tuun1n/why_jersey_city_streetsroads_sucks_so_much/i3928d8/,1,r/jerseycity,0,1

"My husband is from Ukraine, we go to Net Cost in Staten Island, it's about half an hour drive. They have a location in Brighton Beach you can get to by PATH + subway, but it's a long haul. Good if you're in the neighborhood though. And they have a location in Paramus, but we like the SI one. They are owned by immigrants from Ukraine and Uzbekistan, carry a wide range of Eastern European goods, and have put out a statement in support of Ukraine and are donating to Ukraine. When we were there recently selection was worse than usual, which make sense because a lot of their stuff used to come from Ukraine and Russia. But I think they are picking up on imports from Georgia, Moldova, Bulgaria, etc. They have a prepared foods selection that is also very solid. I can't speak to the online ordering as I haven't tried it.  


Edited to add bc I just remembered it: In Jersey city, we are able to find occasional things at Morton Williams in the Newport part of Downtown. They have ryazhenka, kefir, and farmer's cheese that is a reasonable substitute for tvorog. They also have a few jarred/canned things that are sorta generically Eastern European (ex: eggplants in tomato sauce/eggplant caviar).  


If you want blini and borsch though, best bet is to make them yourself! Both are pretty easy to do. We make borsch about once a week, and I do a ""quick"" version that my husband thinks is nearly as good as a more traditional one that's more time consuming.

hey man, if i swim in winter/cold weather, are there any features yo'd prioritize? Looking at swimsuits here. Regardless of sizing.

Edit: acutally damn most of the winter suits dont rate for winter (probably dangerous to swim in there befoere then)

"I’m against it because an armed society — with or without concealed carry — has a chilling effect on free speech and increases the chances of deadly conflict. NJ is the poster child for how firearms can severely limit free speech (see the duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton). 

All kidding aside, NJ has a gun death rate of 5 per 100,000 people which is one of the lowest in the country; Texas and Florida, meanwhile, have triple that rate. Expanding gun ownership or reducing the barriers to legal gun ownership would likely make gun deaths soar. That said, you can still buy a gun in NJ but it is regulated “may” versus “shall” and that’s fine. 

And before any responds with “but my constitutional rights!” Well, sure, but there are limits to other constitutional rights — notably the first amendment — and we regulate things like speech and press freedoms all the time (see broadcast regulations) and that’s broadly seen as constitutional. I don’t see why the states’ ability to regulate gun ownership and licensing should be infringed by the Supreme Court as that’s a radical reinterpretation of the second amendment. There’s also a real debate to be had as to whether or not the second amendment even applies to individual gun ownership. And if that’s the case, then the 14th amendment doesn’t prohibit the states from regulating gun ownership or limiting the way in which guns may be carried.",t2_v064m,nuncio_populi,0,1648900521.0,0,t1_i33kcd3,i33kcd3,True,Literaturefans,t3_tubn33,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/tubn33/thoughts_on_upcoming_2nd_amendment_decision_from/,Thoughts on upcoming 2nd Amendment Decision from Supreme Court?,/r/jerseycity/comments/tubn33/thoughts_on_upcoming_2nd_amendment_decision_from/i33kcd3/,28,r/jerseycity,0,28

"I grew up around guns--my father is a classical outdoorsman who took me hunting, so I don't fit the stereotype of most liberals on Reddit. Ultimately, I'm against increased availability of guns in this country, especially in urban areas. If we can't trust fellow citizens to obey simple traffic laws, for example, why should we expand their access to weapons, which require a great deal of responsibility and care? In much of the US, you don't even need to demonstrate that you're familiar with basic gun safety rules, or that you know what you're doing.

"It appears to be a long story: 

> To all of you amazing people that have been invested in Champs story, here’s what happened! 

On Tuesday afternoon shortly after we left for work Champ opened our heavy loft apartment door, went into the elevator, down 16 floors and out of the lobby without anyone stopping him. We were notified by our floor neighbors who just happened to recognize him near our dog park. By the time we arrived home and our friends in the area were able to get outside, he was gone. Our first lead was that he had made it over to Hamilton Park and was on the run. Throughout the next few hours we had blown up social media, had everyone we knew (and some truly special people in the community we’d never met) out searching for him until well into the next morning. In the next 48 hours we had 1,500 posters printed and posted all around the entire Jersey City and Hoboken area. You could not go a single block without seeing his face. We called every animal control, shelter, vet office, police, fire house etc in a 5+ mile radius. We also got in touch with an outstanding tracker. 

On Thursday afternoon we were given a lead that was far from where we had been targeting our search. He had been spotted near the Broadway Diesel and Gas the night before. After handing out posters and asking everyone we saw in the area we had another confirmed lead as he was spotted at the end of Broadway at National Retail Systems. We set up a trail cam there and another down the rail tracks a few miles up assuming he was using them to travel. 

Friday morning our tracker suggested we take our other dog Rusty for a walk between the two cameras to spread our scent. On this walk a construction worker stopped us about 200 yards from our camera so I asked him to take a photo of the poster from my phone and send it to everyone on the site. We received a call from him 2 minutes later saying he had good news, one of the men on the site had been feeding Champ for the past day and a half. The two construction workers took us to a train  trailer Champ had been camping out in. Within seconds Champ was at our feet, reunited and all four of us ugly cried. 

Almost exactly 72 hours after escaping, Champ is now home, bathed and snuggled up in his spot on the couch. His paws are sore and he’s exhausted but otherwise seems perfectly fine. We couldn’t have found him if it weren’t for the incredible friends we have in the area and the determined community we had behind us. The amount of support, energy and love we were given from you all has us speechless. We are forever grateful to be a part of the Jersey City/Hoboken community.

If you see a poster, please remove it and throw it away with a smile! Spread the word that our guy is home safe! ❤️❤️",t2_9sm04223,artenbraten,0,1648862245.0,0,t1_i3222y8,i3222y8,False,slickmartini,t3_ttxe35,https://www.reddit.com/r/jerseycity/comments/ttxe35/champ/,Champ,/r/jerseycity/comments/ttxe35/champ/i3222y8/,18,r/jerseycity,0,18

"Sorry for necroposting but this is hilarious for both parties: students and the board for this district.

For one, this is a ridiculous solution... yes, the board just wanted to salvage the performing arts programs due to funding being cut... but the solution was to transfer kids into a school environment they didn't want to, or make them stay in the same school by being forced to switch to a different academy? That's ridiculous! There are other ways than this, and it's very sad for the students.

Likewise, the overly ambitious, self-proclaimed ""passionate"" freshmen are also so funny. They really thought they could stop the merge, lol! Word around is that around \~100 kids gathered up in a group chat on several messaging platforms to try and stop the merge. Signing a bunch of petitions will not change the board's mind. And to think that they tipped several local news websites, all for nothing... eventually the server shut down due to it being clowned on + the obviously horribly thought out plan not working at all.

Regardless, still saddened to see such a thing. This was also very unfair for applicants that aren't transfers since they couldn't accept 300+ kids for HT/CP for 22-23.

"This definitely happens and is definitely illegal. Handful of ways to know this: if you share same water heater you’re definitely on same utilities. You can look up your building in public registrars to see if it’s zoned as a 1, 2, 3 unit.

If it has more units rented than allowed you’re very likely on one utility. 

If you’re on the same electric there will be one breaker box for the both apartments - find yours and see if it has labels for the other apt.
