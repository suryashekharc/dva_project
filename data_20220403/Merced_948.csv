"apply at the Merced City School District as a substitute custodian or substitute food server. Custodial pay is 16 an hr and if you don't get 40 hours and are hired on as a food server you can pick up hours doing that job. im unsure of pay outside of custodial, but for a student the pay is good and the job is easy. Mainly vacuuming with some restroom cleaning and a extremely minimal amount of interaction with others, as most jobs are after school and schools usually only have two custodians and a roving supervisor who is just looking for the job to get done.

"Suggestion for finding others.

Go to a store called The Arcane Lab. it's a store that sells a LOT of things that pertain to fantasy and card games. Inquire within about how to find groups or people to start your own group. This store hosts pokemon, Magic the Gathering, and I'm fairly certain other card type of tournaments and games. They sell all sorts of fantasy based items. They probably sell DND stuff.

My point is that the store is a good place to start looking for people to join your group.

Edit: The store is located in Bob Hart square between 16th and 17th streets on Canal street, (which would be L if it was the letter)",t2_e5x2d3z0,hidingfrom666,0,1641061366.0,0,t1_hqtyas4,hqtyas4,True,SoulfulStreets,t3_rtnpb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/rtnpb6/anyone_interested_in_trying_dungeons_dragons/,Anyone interested in trying Dungeons & Dragons?,/r/Merced/comments/rtnpb6/anyone_interested_in_trying_dungeons_dragons/hqtyas4/,9,r/Merced,0,9

"Let me just run down my thoughts on Dispos in Merced-   


Blue Fire - 20+ wait times in line, inexperienced budtenders (more like, 8th fetchers at this place). SOME budtenders will try to sell you some bs, but others will genuinely know their stuff. Best selection of GENUINE products & prices in town. Stay away from any of the store brand stuff (Bluefire or Boujie on a Budget) and always check the harvest date.  

Cookies - No wait times, staff will genuinely help you find something you like but GODDAYMN is this place pricey. Almost 90$ 8ths? (Nah - I'm good on that shit) However, there is good selection of flower (upper & lower price range) but check the ""best use by"" dates on anything edible.   


Manzanita - It is a nice store when you walk in. Some of the product is, well, so-so and can usually be found @ BlueFire for less. The staff seem to be pretty chill and have a base amount of knowledge to help you find a suitable purchase. However, I have to question some of the financial ties this place has to a certain previous DA's family and not to mention one of the managers was a complete bonehead to me one visit - I chose to not patronize this place.",t2_39j4onwc,some-guy78,0,1637477641.0,0,t1_hlhdj5l,hlhdj5l,True,Mysterious_Treacle51,t3_q3e760,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/q3e760/best_dispensary/,Best dispensary?,/r/Merced/comments/q3e760/best_dispensary/hlhdj5l/,1,r/Merced,0,1

"About these tunnels, they do exist and used to connect the downtown buildings but have since been bricked off.  Before El Capitan hotel was rebuilt there was a small plaza area and a couple shops on the corner next to the old ElCap. There was once a visible set of stairs that led down to them from the outside.

Word has it that the tunnels connect all the way up M street to the old courthouse. These tunnels were once used by city officials to frequent downtown taverns and bars like The Partisan and a brothel that once was on Main Street so as to avoid the public eye. 

I’ve been to the basement of a few buildings on main. The hot tub and pool store next to Bob Hart Square has a large basement and what certainly appears to be bricked off set of passages running parallel to Main Street. It is my educated guess that the basements of all or most the buildings were once connected but have since been bricked off due to many of the buildings having been vacant for the past 2 decades and squatting would almost certainly have been an issue.

"I have never heard of these tunnels and I have lived here my whole life. 

If they do exist, my best guess would be that they are under the buildings in the middle of town. Essentially the county buildings. The administration building has an extensive underground floor, and is across M st from the old courthouse. There is also a police station and county public library all within close proximity. These buildings would be where I would begin searching for any underground emergency passages.

"I can't see Merced being a good place to retire. It's my hometown, and I'll always have a fondness for it, but its ""small town vibes"" are a thing of the past. In reality, it *was* a small town back in the 90s, but once the UC was founded it hit a population increase it wasn't prepared for and the city wasn't really planned for it (which results in congestion, due to the town being mostly 2-4 lane roads. Now, what used to be beautiful fields and ag land are track homes and planned communities. And it's just gunna get worse as it expands.

It's weirdly expensive now, also. Even the ""affordable housing"" in the numbered streets is pricy. Its crime rate is also higher than the national average. I grew up in a ""nicer"" area of North Merced and we were broken into, had neighbors who parked cars on the lawn (not that that's a crime, but not necessarily indicative of people who value property), and I was even followed walking home from school once. If I remember correctly, one of the first bath salts incidents happened in Merced; on a bike path I used as a kid.

Someone else said GTFO of California, and I agree with them. Mostly because my own folks just retired and did tons of research on ""best retirement states"" and least taxed, etc. And, *shocker*, California is expensive as hell and not very friendly unless you're regularly raking in money to crap back into its economy.",t2_bev2x,kwiwen,0,1635608071.0,0,t1_hinisrj,hinisrj,True,denita_itsxmas,t3_q5pm7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/q5pm7r/where_to_purchase_home_in_merced/,Where to purchase home in Merced??,/r/Merced/comments/q5pm7r/where_to_purchase_home_in_merced/hinisrj/,2,r/Merced,0,2

"The big neighborhoods are Bellevue (most peoples top choice), Via Moraga, El Redondo, and the “Birds” area around Yosemite/Paulson (mostly north of Yosemite Ave)

I suspect Campus Pkwy neighborhood will be gentrified and very nice in the years to come, but isn’t currently. The birds area might be pretty nice with the new Yosemite Crossing area. 

The golf course (north of Bellevue) is where most of the real money in Merced hides. El Redondo seems to be going a little bit downhill in the past year or so, there are some new builds going up there in the 350K range. Lots of new construction in the low 400s in Bellevue that is super nice. 

I like the Bright Homes in the Moraga area, there’s also a Lennar community there but I believe it has an HOA (preference only).

Lots of older people live on the 20th streets in Merced although I wouldn’t walk around pretty much anywhere past 8pm in this city, especially not anywhere under Yosemite Ave",t2_hcpm3,amonsterinside,0,1633935938.0,0,t1_hg7bajr,hg7bajr,True,denita_itsxmas,t3_q5pm7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/q5pm7r/where_to_purchase_home_in_merced/,Where to purchase home in Merced??,/r/Merced/comments/q5pm7r/where_to_purchase_home_in_merced/hg7bajr/,6,r/Merced,1,6

But honestly, I’m from here. Born and raised. No longer live here, but have you SEEN the crime stats in Merced? It’s very very high right now. A honey oil lab in North Merced just blew up this week. So there’s crime all over. North Merced has typically been “seen” as the better side of town (North of Olive Ave, but seems like it’s even becoming North of Yosemite Ave.) 

I’m looking in south Merced right now (ran crime stats for the locations) and crime is actually “lower” where I had purchased.

"I recommend using neighborhood research services like [maptimum.com](https://maptimum.com) (with which I'm affiliated) to weigh your options against each other based on whatever criteria you have in mind.  
For any address, you receive a detailed report on demographics, education/income levels, personal crime, property crime, car accidents and DUIs, registered sex offenders, political leaning (how they voted in 2020 and 2016), noise levels, walkability, school quality (test scores, ...), nearby section-8 housing, air quality, pollen, etc.  
Here's a sample report I created for two random areas in LA (but the site covers anywhere in California, including Merced).

"Some of the nicest areas are going to be the new neighborhoods being built off Yosemite and Via Moraga, the houses between M and G street but north of Yosemite I believe it’s called Bellevue Ranch area.

Anything west of R street I would avoid, even in one of the nicer areas and the nicest apartments in town being on that side we had regular car jackings and vehicles being broken into.

"I’ve heard little taste of India is good but it’s never open when I try and go (I live down the street from it). I like Burger Time down town and 5 Star Burger on Yosemite parkway. China a Caff on G st is super good! Also, I personally love Atwater Sushi which is like 15 minutes away in the town over but I work in Atwater so it’s not a big deal for me to go there. 

I moved to Merced when I was 13 about 11 years ago and one thing I can say for sure not to do is call the city Merdead. My older brother and
Cousins did it because to us there’s like nothing to do here (we moved from San Jose, a big city in the Bay Area a few hours away) and made other jokes kind of making fun of the place and it’s lack of food diversity, entertainment, etc. this was whatever around family but a school or around their new friends it was super inappropriate! A lot of people here love their city, they were born and raised and of course they have the right to be proud of their home, and this made making friends difficult for the older boys in my family.

That aside, in general I think it would be good to join a club or something at school to get to know people. The community here in general is friendly and there are several things to go out as a group and do.
There’s a roller rink and a rocking jump but last I checked middle schoolers (at least my youngest sisters group of friends) are always there lol. The mall is small and my friend who recently moved her from Stockton often goes to Turlock or even Modesto to get dinner since the options here aren’t very many. There is a 24 hours Mexican food restaurant on R st called Maria’s tacos as well.",t2_d0riq3gq,Ritergirl,0,1628345103.0,0,t1_h8222ki,h8222ki,True,onlyhereforcollege,t3_ozk4l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/ozk4l4/moving_to_merced_soon/,Moving to Merced Soon,/r/Merced/comments/ozk4l4/moving_to_merced_soon/h8222ki/,3,r/Merced,0,3

"Be wary of the crime. Merced has its perks but it’s major flaw is the high crime. Stick to the shopping areas or in crowds and you should be fine. Also avoid wearing mostly red or blue. 

Trevinos has some bomb Mexican food. One of my favorite Chinese places is Hong Kong by the Raley’s. Really really good food! 

When I went to UC Merced many years ago the popular hang out place was the lake about a mile or so up the road. I’m not sure if that’s still the place to chill but it’s a nice place to hang out. 

As places to stay away from, it’s kind of hard to pinpoint. Granted I haven’t lived there in a few years but from what I remember the Denny’s side of town is kind of sketchy so try not to spend too much time there. Loughbrough can get kind of rough. Any park like Applegate (it’s got a small zoo and some rides but from what I’ve been told there’s not much there now) and Bradley and the lakes are pretty popular and safe to hang out at but avoid hanging out at night. 

Merced isn’t a big college town so though there is things to do and places to eat and shop at don’t expect a lot of fancy places or tons of shopping like the big cities.",t2_4ujod8,JDMOokami21,0,1628325602.0,0,t1_h81bbr5,h81bbr5,True,onlyhereforcollege,t3_ozk4l4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/ozk4l4/moving_to_merced_soon/,Moving to Merced Soon,/r/Merced/comments/ozk4l4/moving_to_merced_soon/h81bbr5/,4,r/Merced,0,4

"Of the three, the one that is the least ""yee haw"" is undoubtedly not Merced. It might actually be Bakersfield -- it is the largest and most diverse. All of the central valley has horrible air quality. Merced is pretty rural, so it also smells like manure about half the time. You get used to it, but it's there. 

Personally, I would choose Bakersfield over Merced if I didn't have friends/family closer to Merced. It's just a bigger city with a lot more going on.

But I would choose San Bernardino because it is much closer to stuff. Personally, I find Merced painfully remote. Then again, if the cost of living is too high for you there, then I understand going elsewhere. Be warned: rent is very high and there is a housing crisis in California. You may find it hard to get a decent place anywhere.

Edit: Merced had lots of ""Trump won"" people driving trucks with big flags and stuff in January. It's not a particularly anti-gay place, but it's a lot more conservative than you seem to be thinking -- and Qanon style conservative, at that.",t2_92ur5,squishmaster,0,1626796044.0,0,t1_h5vxz0l,h5vxz0l,True,[deleted],t3_olzmca,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/olzmca/might_be_moving_would_love_some_advice/,"Might be moving, would love some advice",/r/Merced/comments/olzmca/might_be_moving_would_love_some_advice/h5vxz0l/,1,r/Merced,0,1

"I pretty much agree with everyone in this thread that Merced is the best option for the same reasons. 

I would like to add that while Merced is for the most part pretty nice, especially in downtown, it is a much smaller city compared to the other two (82k vs 377k for Bakersfield and 216k for San Bernardino) and your shopping and dining options will be more limited.

"I’ve lived in San Bernardino before and live in Merced now. 
Bakersfield feels like struggle to me but I’ve only gotten gas there so I could be wrong. 
Between San Bernardino and Merced, I prefer Merced. 
San Bernardino can be very rough. Car theft and break ins are pretty common in a lot of areas. 

Merced has a vibrant downtown and I’d live down there if I could choose anywhere in Merced. 
The rest of Merced feels suburban in ways I don’t like, in that, it’s hard to find anywhere to live that’s walkable. I didn’t value that until I moved to Merced and now it’s my main priority in looking for other places. 
The college kids are very college kid but they mostly hang out in pretty well-defined areas so it’s easy to hang out with them if you want to, and it’s easy to avoid them if you want to.

"“HeAlThY pEoPlE dOn’T nEeD a VaCcInE” what a dumb statement. Yes, we do. Because people with compromised immune systems can’t get vaccines and they rely on us to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity to protect them.

Also, this ridiculous “it’S 99.# sUrViVaBlE” bull crap is such and over used excuse I have a doc I pull from since I have to explain this so much to people like you.

Anti-vaxxers and COVID-19 deniers keep on grabbing onto the claim that “CoViD iS 99.# sUrViVaBlE!” But that’s misleading. I know simple minds think simply, but it’s not that simple.
Firstly, if it’s 99.7% survivable, that means 0.3% of the population will die. The US population is roughly 328 million. That means roughly a million people will die. If you flipped out about four deaths in Benghazi, then you don’t get to down play ~one million potential deaths. We’ve already had 600,000 people in this country die from COVID-19. Funeral homes and undertakers in big cities had more corpses than they could process.
Secondly, it’s not 99.# across the board. People with comorbidities have a significantly higher risk. Just because your risk is low doesn’t mean somebody you won’t transmit it to somebody’s grandmother or disabled child.
Thirdly, survivable with medical intervention. But back before vaccines, ICU beds were nearly at capacity and in some places exceeding capacity. There weren’t enough ventilators to go around.
Lastly, survivable doesn’t mean without long term damage to the body. Losing a leg is survivable. But plenty of people are living with permanent lung damage and “long COVID” as it’s being called.",t2_78cqltw5,MrVanderdoody,0,1625250729.0,0,t1_h3u39df,h3u39df,False,Ulooksostupid,t3_ocd58x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Merced/comments/ocd58x/are_you_pro_jab/,Are you pro jab?,/r/Merced/comments/ocd58x/are_you_pro_jab/h3u39df/,1,r/Merced,0,1

"Merced is a very segregated/gerrymandered community that strategically keeps the lower income and underprivileged people of color in south Merced, south of Highway 99. The city council recently voted against affirmation of Black life by refusing a Black Lives Matter mural that includes heavy opposition from the local racists. The county Sheriff is racist towards Asians, suggesting that Covid spread because of female, Asian manicurist shops. County supervisor Scott Silveria supports the continued republican effort overturn the election and has suggested that election fraud is rampant in other cities/states, but of course not Merced. Neighboring Atwater is a safe space for proud boys and militias. Their mayor paul creighton recently got himself into some trouble for trying to shut down a Mexican run businessman after declaring his city a sanctuary city for businesses to operate during the Covid pandemic.

"Merced is more pastoral than city, a lot, arguably, like the Mid-west.

Day-trips to Yosemite and less famous trails towards the Sierras is within two hours' drive or less. I think they have entrance reservations now, fyi.

Day-trips to the Bay Area, San Francisco, and the Central Coast Beach towns are also roughly two to three hours away and traffic really isn't too bad. With Google Maps, you can plan and anticipate traffic.

There's a small but dedicated road bike/racing community so, if you're into that...

There are a lot of outdoorsy people in the UCM system, so you'll have plenty of people to pick their brains who are knowledgeable about more hiking-type trips within a drive/bike ride's reach. If you make friends with Biology staff/profs etc, I'm sure they have hikes out to the vernal pools behind the UC. Some of the best ""hiking"" close to the UC.

"Why would you assume I don’t have a job. My job for my “regular income” is as a teacher. I moonlight as a night shift phone support for home computer users. 

Here is why I call them low-lives:
-	One of the families stiffing me on rent, the guy is a CFO for a prominent local manufacturer and his wife is a 2nd grade teacher. Neither one of them has been negatively financially impacted by covid. These people used to come to my Memorial Day bbq every year. These people make upwards of $300,000 per year. 
-	Another is a single guy who works as a programmer from home, always has. He is not having a financial hardship. He is not poor. 
-	Another skipped 7 months of rent, $1,700 x 7 = $11,900. During which time he bought a brand new F250. He is paying an extra $100 for the next 10 years so he can catch up. Like I’m a bank. 
-	Another has turned my property into a meth-den or heroine-den. I have security cameras on a storage shed at that property. The same guy keeps breaking in. 

These people just chose to not pay their rent. They are in the wrong 100%. 

My personal net income from the properties since January of 2020 to date is approximately $-82,000, not counting unrealized property damage. In 2019, my sister and I combined earned about $56,000. 

We’ve never taken any money out of our real estate earnings. That account will be empty by the end of this year if something doesn’t change fast.

"I have four properties with people that I need to evict. I’ll be bankrupt soon. Maybe you’ll be able to buy one of my properties at auction that are full of low lives with more regular income than me who decided to stop paying rent. 

My recommendation is to start squatting in an empty property. You’ll be very hard to remove.  I know this because one of my renters stopped paying rent last year in April. I gave them 60 extra days because of the hardship. I was unable to evict them in the summer. When I was finally able to move forward, a whole different family was moved in without my knowledge. That family is still there. I don’t even know their names. My property is destroyed. I can’t afford the lawyer.

If you want to “move” these people out “anonymously,” and fix up the place, then you can stay there for free for 18 months. After that, it’s $2250. North Merced near El Cap High, 4 bd, 3.5 bath, 2-car garage, Pool, Solar, Tesla Power-wall, Tesla Charger, and built in 2007. I’m told they never had an electric bill on the annual rebalance plan, only natural gas. 

The carpets are destroyed. The hardwood needs to be refinished. The pool is drained, but in good shape. I have the pool pump and filter for it, it needs to be reinstalled. My squatters smashed the plumbing for it. We just noticed the $20,000 multi-zone air conditioning is missing off the roof. I estimate $48,000 in damages total. It’s in better shape than my properties in south Merced, that are also not paying rent. 

What makes it worse is that I owned some of these properties with my sister who died of covid last summer.

"One thing for sure, being Asian decent, circumcisions is not something we practice but I along with other Asian kids were bullied by other kids who were ""snipped."" I didn't know what the word meant at that time but remembered other kids (mostly white) pointing at our penises  and basically taunted us and expressing how gross we were that our skin was still in tact. ""Ewww, you guys are not circumcised."" ""Hahahah, they still have their skin.""  I am sure the other Asian kids were thrown off by this but personally I thought something was wrong with me. I remember the week being there, I tried sneaking a boxer/underwear but was always forced (taunted, talked down, yelled at) to take it off. Back then we really did look at this part of the world (USA-yes I am first generation American) as a ""white man's"" world and I went through a phase of wondering if I needed to snip my foreskin to be normal. All the adults saw this but didn't do anything. Not sure why this was normal at all. Hmmm...contact the police?

Basically, the house was owned by Miller Parker, a longtime Central Valley Resident, CPA, and supposedly a Civic Leader. His family immigrated from Europe sometime during WWII, his brothers and himself raised in Le Grand.

Steven Walstead writes, 

""Miller was a local accountant and a very talented artist. His home was an artistic statement in its own right. He made many cast cement sculptures that adorned the entire property. His style was pure Picasso. He was a great role model and exposed me to a much wider world of art. He was a bit of the international in our little farm town. The original house was beautifully designed and full of art￼. It had nothing to do with stucco embarrassment that’s there now.""
