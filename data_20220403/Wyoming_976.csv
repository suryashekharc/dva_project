"I‚Äôm guessing WY is going to spend most of that fed money just getting electricity to locations ‚Äúevery 50 miles‚Äù (according to fed requirements) on I-80 alone. The requirements also state that each location should be able to fast-charge 4 vehicles at a time. 

FYI: Each L2 fast charger requires a 50 amp, 240v circuit, so at bare minimum, each station will require at least a 200 amp service delivery (without including lights)‚Ä¶

200 amp service is more than most homes have, especially in rural/remote areas. 

Although the plan is noble and ambitious, I sincerely wonder how much $ over the fed grant the WY taxpayers will be on the hook for, especially when looking at placing charging stations in extremely remote areas every 50 miles (like between Laramie and Evanston). -Those locations may require *miles* of new electric infrastructure to service them, and infrastructure is never cheap. 

Along with the above, I‚Äôm also wondering how much the grid will have to be upgraded to accommodate the extra loads‚Ä¶ -That cost will ultimately be passed onto the WY electricity consumer. 

And finally, who will cover the maintenance costs of these stations every 50 miles? The components (like every other charger or pump) will break over time, plus each one of these locations will require trash pickup/cleanup. They‚Äôll also require extra manpower to maintain the electric service delivery. 

I‚Äôll definitely be curious to see how WYDOT approaches this, and I wonder if it wouldn‚Äôt be cheaper to approach this from a state-level perspective. It‚Äôd allow us to more strategically plan charging locations outside of the every 50 mile requirement, and also allow (if needed) fewer chargers at a location based upon available grid service.

If we take the fed money, we‚Äôre stuck with the strings attached to it‚Ä¶then and in the future. And while the fed grant is ok for more populated states, it may end up costing WY more than what it receives.",t2_5n2u3zl0,ColoWyoPioneer,0,1649003688.0,0,t1_i38nhyl,i38nhyl,True,rthaut,t3_tuumnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyoming/comments/tuumnq/wyoming_prepares_to_electrify_roadways_wyofile/,"Wyoming Prepares to ""Electrify"" Roadways - WyoFile",/r/wyoming/comments/tuumnq/wyoming_prepares_to_electrify_roadways_wyofile/i38nhyl/,1,r/wyoming,0,1

"Mostly positive and I am happy overall. I've had some minor outages. Most of the time it works well. I pre-order before the beta ever started. I received mine in January of 2021. It took time for the network to stabilize since there was hardly enough satellite coverage when my service first started.

I currently see an average of 150/10 with an average latency of 40ms. It works well for most things people will do. However the latency still isn't great for things like gaming.

I still have my WISP as a backup and was using it for low latency things like gaming. However the tower is having trouble this year and latency is much worse than Starlink during peak times. I am told it may be fixed in a few weeks. Hopefully Starlink will improve the latency side. It is still night and day better than any other satellite based service.

"What a joke. Eminent domain has nothing to do with house prices. People are getting $200k all cash buyers over asking in some areas because they can and no laws can or will stop that. You ever see a property auction for high end real estate for places like cali? Some properties will appraise for $800k but sell for $5 million because a couple millionaires want it. There isnt a cap on what something is worth. Something is worth what someone is willing to pay for it. The free market dictates what something is worth, as it should be and not the government. 

I know plenty of investment property owners that arent billionaires...actually all of them I know are very middle or middle upper class just trying to expand their investments. My parents being one of them who make less than $100k a year that have a 2nd house mortgage to afford the investment property. Another is a good friend whose wife is a teacher and he is a firefighter, they arent the evil billionaires you think every landlord is. Forcing them to put caps on their rental properties would be a slap in the face. Why should they be punished for making good decisions and taking the risks of a rental property? Because whiny people say so? Give me a break.

America does have price controls and subsidies that regulate the cost of food in America. Look at hamburger prices from 1982 to 2022... The price has increased but not at the same rate as inflation because of price controls.

"5G depends greatly on the band (frequency) and distance. Many people in Wyoming do not live close enough to the current towers to benefit from quality 5G internet connection. 50-100 Mbps internet is usable for the short term. However data usage continues to increase and compression technology isn't keeping up for services like video streaming. It is not hard for a family of four to saturate a 50-100 Mbps connection.

The federal broadband money is already allocated. Wyoming should definitely speed all of it for our benefit.

"I hope anyone who has fiber appreciates it. It is night and day different from the typical rural WISP and DSL services. I had fiber when I lived in Cody. I lost it when I moved outside of town and had to get WISP. WISP has been mostly a nightmare, very high priced ($100 for 7/3), and heavy congestion at peak times causing high latency and slower speeds. Fortunately I got Starlink over a year ago and that has been mostly wonderful.

One day I hope TCT West will run fiber in my area. I have been asking for it since 2018. I spoke to them a few weeks ago and they said that it is dedicated by Wyoming. Not sure I believe this... The representative might have been talking about the federal money for expansion.

Fiber will not practical everywhere. WISP can still provide high speeds and low latency if the towers are connected to fiber. The problem is that most ISP's overload the towers. Starlink is another good solution but growth has been limited due to the chip shortage.

Everyone in Wyoming should continue to take the speed test at the following link. This will help the state determine areas most in need. One main area that was missed on this survey was price in my opinion. The WISP service in my area is crazy high for the speed and quality of connection provided.

"It's just playing with numbers.  Like that CSX marketing where they claim to [move 1 ton of freight 492 miles on one gallon of fuel](https://www.csx.com/index.cfm/about-us/the-csx-advantage/fuel-efficiency/).  While technically true, it doesn't really tell the whole story IMO.

With respect to fiber, it's just glass tube.  No precious metals or rare stuff to produce.  Relatively cheap material and most of the install expense is labor.  So when fiber is laid, there is usually extra material included in the project.  It's not uncommon to have 864-strand backbones.

"Some places to start for you:

Start here and watch this.  [Wyoming's Heritage Apples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPfK4KohfBc) short documentary by Wyoming PBS. Only 9mins.  

[Wyoming Apple Project](http://www.uwyo.edu/barnbackyard/_files/documents/magazine/2014/winter/010114bbwyappleproject.pdf) attempts to save Wyoming‚Äôs diverse apple cultivars.  Steve Miller, professor at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, is the project lead.  His contact info at the bottom of the article.  

Lander, just on the other side of the mountain from Kemmerer, is home to the first apple orchard (mentioned in the video above) and to many other orchards.  Lander is called [Wyoming's Apple City.](https://wyostatearchives.wordpress.com/2015/07/17/lander-wyomings-apple-city/)  

The Central Wyoming College Sinks Canyon Center, just outside Lander, was home to one of the first commercial apple orchards in Wyoming.  [The Orchard](https://www.cwc.edu/orchard/) contains many regional varieties and also a descendent of the very original [Johnny Appleseed variety](https://www.cwc.edu/about/news/spring-2017/legendary-tree-to-be-planted-at-sinks-canyon-center-orchard.php).  

Check out this story map to learn about the [Restoration of the Sinks Canyon Apple Orchard](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/2226777fdab54f69ad07990e31ab71fb)

The [Pioneer Museum](https://fremontcountymuseums.com/the-lander-museum/) in Lander hosts an annual event called Apple City Festival in September.  Jack States is in the video above and he'd be a great contact for all things apples.  You can contact the museum for Jack's contact information.  

I guess what I'm getting at, if you want to dive into the rich history of Apples in Wyoming you want to include Lander in your trip.  If Kemmerer is your first stop you could cruise over to Lander (150 miles) then take the route from Lander through Dubois and up to the Jackson/Yellowstone region.",t2_b7us88am,razdazalcatrazzz,0,1648668397.0,0,t1_i2r5013,i2r5013,True,stastam1,t3_tscwul,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyoming/comments/tscwul/looking_for_heritagelost_apple_finders_in_wyoming/,Looking for Heritage/Lost Apple Finders in Wyoming,/r/wyoming/comments/tscwul/looking_for_heritagelost_apple_finders_in_wyoming/i2r5013/,4,r/wyoming,0,4

Housing market is probably cheaper than your used to. but the apartment prices are stupid high.

"School is for learning. There‚Äôs plenty of time after school, on weekends and all summer for kids to play. Cutting homework down to a reasonable amount would help, as would leaving recess out altogether and letting the kids out of school earlier. It‚Äôs not the government‚Äôs or school‚Äôs responsibility to see that kids spend time playing.. isn‚Äôt that something kids do in their spare time? Is recess for the kids or so the teachers can get a break?

It brings to my mind the campaign the NFL pushes, called ‚ÄúPlay 60,‚Äù which encourages kids to play at least an hour a day. When I was a kid we played every spare moment, only running home to scarf down dinner and then running back outside to play. Pretty sad that kids aren‚Äôt doing that on their own.

It seems many parents expect the schools to do parenting for them, like seeing that their child exercises, and expecting teachers to discipline their kids, and to teach them non-school subjects that they themselves don‚Äôt want to deal with, like general good behavior, courtesy, and to reject bigotry, racism, discrimination and hate. Those are foundations parents should be instilling into their kids, so schools can concentrate on teaching science and English and history.",t2_5h48t00o,Moondolin,0,1648362407.0,0,t1_i2aansn,i2aansn,True,JonesinJames,t3_t5un1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyoming/comments/t5un1h/wyoming_has_received_an_f_for_recess_policy_for/,"Wyoming has received an ""F"" for recess policy for children.

"That's *sort of* true, but that's already how water rights work in Wyoming. Senior water rights holders get precedence. If there's not enough water to go around, the most recent water permits get shut off first. So if there's not enough water to go around, you already don't get a right to use the water under your land.

This law mostly just clarifies the standard that should be used when there's a dispute over a new well. It could potentially prove to be pretty onerous to new water users, because they have to prove a negative. It's easier to prove that there will be harm from a new well then to prove that there definitely won't. So the state engineer will have to figure out some sort of reasonable standard.

It's important to note also that these rules are for agricultural and industrial water uses. Residential water always gets priority.

"Polluted? No, I don‚Äôt think anywhere in Wyoming is polluted. It‚Äôs more that they are brown, dusty and just kind of ‚Ä¶ meh in my opinion. 

They do offer more options for shopping and dining so if that‚Äôs what your looking for then it might be right up your ally. Granted the wind in Casper is hell on wheels.

I find anything in the northern half of the state more appealing. The forests are amazing especially if you want to do a lot of outdoor activities. 

You‚Äôre best bet would be to look at photos online of popular destinations and scenic byways. You‚Äôll find a huge difference between the landscape on the southern and northern halves of the state

"I‚Äôd ask why you‚Äôre deciding to move here. What do you do for work? Are you retired? What kind of housing budget do you have?  What amenities do you want/need in the town that you live?  Have you visited in the winter before?

I‚Äôm not discouraging anyone from moving here, but it‚Äôs very different than almost every other state.  Most towns outside of Casper, Gillette, Cheyenne, Laramie, Sheridan, etc. are insanely small and don‚Äôt have much in the way of grocery stores, organized things to do, etc. If you love hunting or camping, Wyoming is great. If you want to be able to go clubbing or to the ballet, don‚Äôt move here. 

What you do for work also matters, as most of the economy is based around energy with some tourism. Do you work remotely? Great!  Otherwise it can be difficult to find well-paying jobs. 

Have you lived someplace with wintry weather?  Can you drive on ice? Are you planning to live in town or do you want to live in the country? If you live out of town, there might not be anyone to plow the roads (let alone your driveway). High winds make snowdrifts that can be over 7 feet tall, so you better be ready to dig yourself out of worst case scenarios. 

What are your politics? Wyoming is the most conservative state in the country, and while people are generally friendly, they‚Äôre likely going to be *very* Republican. 

It‚Äôs a lot to think about, but there are so many people who think they‚Äôd love living here because they visited Jackson Hole one time and think that‚Äôs the whole state.

"FISA is a talking point (half century old legislation) just because of Trump's election assistance from Russia. Guarantee 90% of Wyoming didn't know what FISA was before 2016. 

Federal Land Management reform in WY (half the land is federally administered) just means more privatization and selling it off to out of state billionaires that want more ranch land, coal mining companies to strip mine, and oil & gas leases. Turning our public lands over to the super wealthy just means more fences and gates, less places I can 4-wheel, hike, camp, and snowmobile. I've lived in quite a few states, and it's always the same rhetoric of ""Federal over-reach, we need to make it LOCAL"" and then it ends up being owned by someone rich rather than we the people. Whether it's a Ted Turner shithead wanting more ranch land, or some logging company out of Washington or Idaho. It's the same outcomes.

What does ""Focus on Deregulation in Federal Arena"" mean? [I went to their website and it's just 17 pages of ""gubernment and regulashunz BAD""](https://www.hagemanforwyoming.com/issues) and not actually explaining what specifically is the problem and why it should be reform. Having watched the last 40 years of Reaganomics sell off my country to their wealthy donors in the name of ""privatization,"" it kind of seems ""gubernment bad"" rhetoric is actually ""I want my incredibly wealthy buddies to own every piece of the country and turn it into a giant rent-seeking cash cow.""

""Second Amendment protections?"" WY is effectively a Constitutional Carry state. There's literally nothing Hageman will do to ""protect muh gunz"" when the last couple I bought new took about 13 minutes of paperwork combined at a gun store in Laramie, and I can open carry even without my permit.

I'll give that she's not party of the Cheney dynasty. Counter point: she's loudly endorsed by the Trump Klan, so that's not remotely any better. Astro-turfing still isn't actually a grassroots campaign, believe it or not.

You can point out that she's from here; she's also the most well funded candidate by, surprise, millions in out of state dollars. Both Dark Money and otherwise.

Oh and the other important campaign points: ""Securing our border from Biden's (non-existent) open border policy"" since ya know, in WY, I'm \*terrified\* of the imaginary Ecuadorian invasion caravans supposedly in Mexico. ""Keeping taxes low"" when WY doesn't have an income tax, and the average income here is $34k...meaning marginal taxes are \~$4k, far below the standard deduction of $12k, so the average worker is getting money back every year. More bullshit dog-whistling for the wealthy donor class that means nothing to us workers.

TL;DR - A sock puppet for the billionaire class dangling social (non) issues to convince workers to vote against their own economic interests. Nothing new to see here.

Antelope dash is less unique, but popular, fun, and usually find something unique for swag.

"Most of the state doesn't get a ton of snow -- Jackson and Pinedale get, on average, a foot per month during the winter, but I would expect it to accumulate a lot more in Jackson, due to the topography.  Cody gets about half that.

The temperature fluctuates a lot, and below-zero temps are common (and wind chill often subtracts another 20 degrees).  It's unusual for it to *stay* below zero for more than a week or so, but you definitely have to plan ahead as far as keeping your car running, stocking up on non-perishable food in case you do get stuck at home, etc.

Of those three towns, Jackson would be the most isolated (I've never driven those roads in the winter, and wouldn't want to).

"> You think the extraction industries gives 2 shits beyond how it impacts their bottom line?

Yes, because you cannot produce your product if you don't. Most are members of the local communities as well. They spend a lot more money than activist groups in pursuit of this as well.

I disagree. Like I said previously, environmental engineers are a hot commodity for a reason. 

> Your last point is pretty weak as the state of Wyoming has one of the most anemic state environmental agency in the country.

The Wyoming DEQ does a good job. You can read about what they do here. https://deq.wyoming.gov/

> Our entire state gov't has been captured by oil, gas, and coal...So if you think WY, with 2x the wells and less oversight is going to have less clean up costs than New Mexico, than I have a bridge to sell you.

Also, Wind, Solar, and Nuclear. You have to permit your waste. Permit your land useage, permit your air quality, permit your water quality, etc. 

If you don't, then you are shut down. 

I think you are just looking at bad things in the past and thinking that we have not learned from them and not understanding all the regulations that companies have to go through. 

There is a lot more that you can do at home than you can do at an industrial site. 

For example. 

You can throw away light bulbs into the trash at home, but at an industrial site you have to collect them and ship them off as universal waste. 

>That doesn't account for the coal companies flipping the bird to reclaimation to the tune of 1.8 billion

Mining companies have to take out bonds for reclamation. Not sure what the case was in New Mexico, but I do know that mining companies in the Trona Patch all have bonds that ensure they will reclaim the land once finished mining. Not sure if New Mexico was before this or not, like I said I am not familiar with the situation in New Mexico.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

It really depends on the regulations... bureaucrats holed up in DC can write regulations that work for one region, and make no sense for another region. I know some good regulators, and some dipshits that have their head in the weeds.

"Your simple solutions solve exactly nothing if you're looking to stop or reduce abortions. If you simply want it illegal, sure, you can make it illegal, but you need only look at the war and drugs or prohibition for evidence that this often doesn't do much to stop it from happening, and can result in a rise in crime and general human suffering. 

Just make it illegal in Wyoming? Fine, people go elsewhere. The amount of abortions you actually prevent? Minimal.

Make it illegal everywhere? Unsafe surgery, rise in crime, dead young women. You might curb those abortions a bit, but at the cost of a lot of human suffering.

So yeah, I'm sorry you disagree that legal abortion should be available here, but I'm all for it. Last I checked, about one in four people in this state have liberal leanings (if the way we vote is any indication.) That's definitely a minority, also, that's not ""hardly anyone."" And I'm fairly confident that they would generally vote pro choice. 

Anyway, as I stated, if you're looking to make something illegal, fine, but don't expect that to be any kind of solution. If conservatives spent their time and resources on giving young mothers more options and support, they might actually do something to reduce the number of abortions.
