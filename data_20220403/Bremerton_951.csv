"> SO is going to probably find a job out in Seattle, so the best case scenario would be to find a place that has access to public transport to the seattle ferry

Just a heads up: currently our ferries to Seattle have less than ideal service. There's a handful of 30 minute boats that launch only before 8 am and a handful that start returning from Seattle only after 2, and stop around 8. The large boat runs from like 4am to 12am, but it also only runs basically every two hours. It is a LOT of commuting. I do it, I don't mind, but I know quite a few former daily commuters that cite the ferry commute as the reason why they took a paycut to find a local job.

Not to discourage your SO! If you like to read, do some work, a small craft, portable gaming, the ferry commute is lovely. It's gorgeous!! But unless your schedule lines up perfectly with the ferry times you can be out of the house a lot longer. It's really not uncommon for me to be out of the house 12.5 hours from leaving my house to arriving back home, and that's with no other public transit involved. The fast ferry is 100% worth it if you have the choice.",t2_7z3msoke,sheep_heavenly,0,1647738495.0,0,t1_i1cmqr8,i1cmqr8,False,forlinux,t3_thoyrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bremerton/comments/thoyrp/moving_to_work_at_puget_sound_shipyard/,Moving to work at Puget Sound Shipyard,/r/Bremerton/comments/thoyrp/moving_to_work_at_puget_sound_shipyard/i1cmqr8/,2,r/Bremerton,0,2

"We have more cloud cover than you two will be used to, which means vitamin D deficiency. Take vitamin D supplements daily from the fall to the spring. Vitamin D issues can cause depression, lethargy, etc. It's helpful to get bloodwork done to see where your D levels are at, and have your GP tell you how much to take a day to stay normal.

It rains more here than you'll be used to. We just keep doing our normal thing despite it. You can't just hibernate during the wet winter season, or else you'll be indoors half the year. Hikes, sightseeing, beach combing, walks with the doggie, a meal on a heated outdoor patio. It's all still here to enjoy, just bundle up in a sweater, raincoat, and some shoes that are rain-proof. Some of the most beautiful things you'll see here will be in the rain, like walking on a silent forest trail through old growth evergreens while mist swirls above you and raindrops fall from cedar boughs.

For reference, my go-to rainwear is [this coat](https://www.rei.com/product/164446/rei-co-op-rainier-long-line-rain-jacket-womens) and [these boots](https://www.blundstone.com/black-premium-leather-chelsea-boots-womens-style-558), with normal tops and pants that vary depending on temperature.

People here are nice but not midwest outgoing. It's harder to make friends here, for a lot of people. What works though is to join hobby groups in order to meet people. On Facebook and Meetup, join stuff like hiking or biking groups, tabletop games, mycology hikes, etc. Whatever you two are into.

"> BREMERTON — By late summer, diners could once again be noshing fish and chips while watching planes take off and touch down at Bremerton National Airport. 

Amelia's Hangar, a new restaurant at the Port of Bremerton's airport complex off Highway 3, is slated to open later this year, according to the local restaurateurs who won the port's contract to operate in a building still under construction. 

Don and Rena Morris, a McCleary couple who've run restaurants in Western Washington for 25 years, are bringing old favorites known in the previous diner, including fish and chips and clam chowder. 

""It's a great opportunity,"" said Rena Morris, who with her husband operates the Burger Claim and More restaurant in Belfair, which opened in 2019.",t2_217jmpsc,seagolfbeer,0,1647446941.0,0,t1_i0wej5a,i0wej5a,True,seagolfbeer,t3_tflk0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bremerton/comments/tflk0b/restaurant_announced_for_bremerton_national/,Restaurant announced for Bremerton National Airport; opening slated for summer,/r/Bremerton/comments/tflk0b/restaurant_announced_for_bremerton_national/i0wej5a/,1,r/Bremerton,0,1

"it really is pretty nice. good drinks. good food. good people. BUT.

the lighting, layout and ambience. the place has about 50 too many flush mount ceiling flood lights. you know the feeling you get after a play or a concert when everything is over and the house lights come on? it's like that, except the whole time. you walk in and its so bright, you might imagine they are about to close and bring out the mop buckets. If they just put them all on a main dimmer switch and dimmed them 40%, the problem would be mostly solved.

also, its a repurposed space, so it doesn't feel ""right"". there is too much empty space. the bar isn't a real bar, its clearly an old restaurant. so the whole place just screams ""we moved in here and haven't really thought out the space"".

the advantage of such a scenario is you can have big event/party spaces, and room for 3 full size pool tables. which is great!

"Agree personally that governments should provide public transportation, but (serious question) does Washington have an actual, legal obligation to do so?

Unfortunately, a lot of our fellow Washingtonians do expect it to be run like a business. (Nigh impossible for any mass transit system, but that's a different conversation.) No secret how much resistance there is to finding money for infrastructure, and this is what we can expect from a chronically underfunded system.

It's really frustrating, but I don't really buy ""the state is fucking us"" narrative if it's the best of many crap choices.

"It might make sense WSF were a private company, but the state has a responsibility to provide public transportation.

As far as the lack of crew/boats goes, I totally understand the reduced schedule - as long as they’re making an earnest effort to fix it as soon as possible.

"To make sure I understand correctly: You've accused me of arrogance and conflated said arrogance with not having ""first clue when it comes to snow management in the PNW"" after expressing a ""feeling"" about what I think, then smugly expressed your suspicion of superior ""generational knowledge"", ""education', and ""experience"". 

That seems more like projection to me.

A lot of folks around here seem to have an sense of smug superiority toward anyone that is 'not from here', even those that are themselves not from here. Pretty common, of course, but it's still frustrating. I've noticed what seems like a mental ledger folks keep related their 'PNWness' (such as their own tenure in the region, or their family's experience, or perhaps their previous state's nearer proximity to Washington) which seems to result in 
a general inclination to shut down anyone that they don't believe are as PNW as themselves with whom they disagree. 

For what it's worth I have indeed taken the time to actually learn about where I live as I've been trying to move here (Kitsap specifically) for the last ~7 years (and to the PNW at large my entire adult life) and have spent that time studying the area's history, climate, government, 

You mentioned the number of Kitsap plows, but this is the Bremerton subredddit, right? So, while I think the county probably could / should improve their own response, I'd prefer to focus specifically on the city of Bremerton for now.

It appears, according Bremerton's [website](https://www.bremertonwa.gov/1001/Inclement-Weather), the city operates 6 plows, though according the [arcgis map](https://bremerton.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=4908a57581a747f8a91e4e1ef9dba1de) today they are possibly only running 5 right now (I mention this as thought I saw 6 on the map yesterday, so I'm unclear on if they're all up at the moment and their website says the map may not be reporting accurately, but that they're working on it). According to their own [plan](http://www.bremertonwa.gov/DocumentCenter/View/6973/Inclement-Weather-Procedures-PDF) they're supposed to have applied a salt-brine before this event, but from what I could tell they did not. They also didn't begin snow clearing operations until well into the snow event after a lot of cars had already begun compressing the top layers of snow into ice against the warm earth. 

I don't think this was the right response. I don't believe they made good on their own plan.

Additionally, I am frustrated with the lack of response by my fellow homeowners in Bremerton who have mostly done nothing to clear their own driveways and walkways, something that could be enforced, particularly against the incredible number of rental property owners here who do nothing for their tenants whatsoever.

I have yet to have anyone present a convincing argument for why the response to these snow events couldn't be handled better beyond the same thing you're saying: ""it's different here"". It's the same response I got last January when the same delayed lack of response occurred.

I am not claiming that things aren't 'different' but that they could still be handled better than they are. I've my own experience, education, and generational knowledge, and I wouldn't ever suggest that ""what works in one place would work everywhere"". I'm keenly aware of this fact for a variety of reasons that I don't need to explain to you.

Perhaps it's worth pointing out that my desire to get back to the west coast and make this move to the PNW is rooted deeply in the knowledge that the PNW is absolutely a different place from just about anywhere else. 

That doesn't mean that I can't want a better snow response from my city and fellow community members.

"Wyoming is definitely quite different in my experience to the PNW as well as the midwestern areas I mentioned above.

I am not arguing that there aren’t differences, generally, between the midwestern states I referenced and the PNW. 

I can assure you, however, that there are plenty of reasonable enough analogs to draw comparisons to snow responses here vs there. There are some topologically interesting areas to consider in the Midwest, such as along the St. Croix River valley, and along the shores of the Great Lakes or the Black Hills in South Dakota - and some of these places have comparable populations and similar snow fall infrequencies, and I can promise you that most years their first snows are the same warm ground and wet slush that we tend to get here 

Generally it gets cleared and everyone moves on with their lives and the season

Which is my point - I’m supremely confident that with a small amount of effort we could have a much better experience during snow events like these that would make everyone’s lives better overall for these few days each year that everything seems to shut down

Judging by people’s responses, however, I have determined that people would rather make excuses about how it’s just not possible -

That means collective snow days for all, which isn’t the worst thing, I suppose

That seems like an ad hominem attack against me as opposed to discussing the topic by calling me a “clown” and suggesting that I am “not a serious person”.

I’m suggesting that we hold home owners, business owners, and our government accountable to actually responding to a potential deadly threat in a reasonable way so that we can all carry on through snow events like most other places else that experience them without missing a beat

"You don’t think so? You’re probably right. Seems like there’s not much will to change the way things are around here at all. 

I think taking a collective snow day(s) over a few inches of snow a couple/few times a year sounds like enormous wasted opportunity, ignores a solvable problem (at least until it can’t be ignored any further) and just ultimately seems lazy to me. 

People walking in the same streets where people don’t know how to drive since no one clears walkways is dangerous. Overall it’s likely our most vulnerable folks most at risk during these events.

I don’t like the “It’s how it’s always been” response. It just feels to me like we could do better as a community

Edit to add: listen, I’m not doing more than complaining about it on Reddit, and I’m more surprised by the response to snow events here given their frequency than anything - I can compare other communities (in the Midwest) with the same level of snow infrequency that handle it much better.

"I disagree with your evaluation. 

I’ve been watching this region for a while. What happened this week isn’t new, this seems to happen every winter that we get these snow events. They’re forecasted early enough and there are enough resources that the city / county could respond before and early during the snow falls but simply fails to do so. 

What I’m saying is that this will keep happening, the trends are clear that we’re going to keep getting these bursts of “unusual” snow events and we should respond to them better.

I think it’s ludicrous for the region to shut down for multiple days whenever these events occur. 

My point in comparing Minnesota and its response is simply to make clear that if another region that gets hit with more snow is able to handle it fine enough without society hunkering down for months like it’s some kind of apocalypse, then what happens here is silly by comparison.

"It’s gorgeous! I love it! 

Of course it wouldn’t be so bad by car (or on foot, I’m looking at you uncleared walkways) if people here took the weather more seriously. It’s baffling being the only person on my block actually clearing their driveway and walkways. The city / county with their delayed response to the snow event on Monday made everything even more treacherous on the roads than it needed to be. With snow falling on warm ground they could have pre-treated and mobilized earlier. 

Everything here just shuts down for a single little snow event?!? What’s up with that?!? Doctor’s offices, the mall, waste management?!? Everything just stopped for a couple days over a few inches of snow, which seems bonkers to me. 

I moved here from Minnesota where snow events like this will happen multiple times a week for months and we all just clear it up carry on with our lives like normal. 

And what’s the deal with people acting shocked when these snow events happen? “Wow, what a freak storm, that never happens here?!?” says the same people year after year when it happens.

"Honestly, it’s completely dependent on time but I’d say, unless the congestion is due to an accident or something out of the ordinary, 15-20 minutes tops. And I suspect that may be on the high side. 

And if you have the ability to flex your schedule at all, which I know some people at NBK can do, you can probably miss it altogether.  

What I would do, pick a location in the area (house/apt. you’re considering) and check the commute time to the job at like 9:30am on a Tuesday in both directions.

"Re: sketchiness vs a sense of safety for your family, there’s really no place around here where my family or I have truly felt unsafe - maybe the alleys behind the Oriental Market on 6th and the area around the 7-11 and the rescue mission up along MLK Way behind PCHS where the houseless folks congregate may qualify, but it’s pretty easily avoided and really isn’t so much as “sketchy” as uncomfortable - 

There was someone raped in an elevator at a parking garage recently by someone seemingly well know to law enforcement. That sort of thing happens anywhere and from my evaluation violent crime among strangers here seems to be rare here and if I recall correctly actually statistically low for the population.

"1. Bremerton's certainly the closest to urban / city to the Shipyard for sure. That being said, it's very small compared to Tacoma. (And even more so than Seattle of course.)

"I moved here a little over a year ago and have my own ""planning to move there?"" thread in r/Kitsap with some interesting feedback. We love it here, but of course my life is probably very different from yours so ymmv. 

I bought in Bremerton within a mile from the ferry terminal. My property is between two urban rental units. Rentals in Bremerton are a huge thing as there are a lot of out-of-town homeowners raking in that naval housing allowance here which seems to contribute a lot to the sense of urban decay folks mention. 

The urban area of Bremerton is small, as others have pointed out. Bremerton, as I understand it, has been on the verge of becoming a 'real city' for the better part of 40 years but has just never quite made it. The history here is pretty interesting. There's some odd vibes in terms of culture, for example: I have met very few people who are actually from Bremerton, let alone Washington (lots of folks from Montana and a few from California), who live here. I think that has a pretty significant impact on the lack of progress in becoming a real city as so much of the population here is very transient (which seems to be navy folks who drift in an out because of the bases)  

Moving outward from the 'urban' feel of Bremerton near downtown and around PSNS it cuts immediately to a mixture of suburban and rural, between the two here are often pretty subtle.

Over the last year it has been interesting watching the activity level grow with the influx of folks to the area, which seems driven mostly by PSNS.

My family and I actually spent a month in Tacoma while house hunting between Pierce, King, and Kitsap counties. Tacoma stinks (literally) and really doesn't offer much compared to living in Kitsap as far as I'm concerned. The cheaper real estate and the slightly lower cost of living means Kitsap is a bit more affordable. You can find yourself in the woods within a 15 minute drive and the ease of access to the Olympic peninsula as well makes it wonderful for anyone with even a passing interest in the great PNW outdoors. Even the Cascades and the rest of Washington are pretty accessible from here. The fact that it's 30-60 minutes to Seattle, \~30 minutes to Tacoma, and even under an hour to Olympia is just \*chef's kiss\* fantastic. 

In regards to the 'family' vs. sketchy topic: Manette up through Ilahee is more suburban and feels a bit more family friendly, I suppose. There are little pockets of sketchy all around here, but I suppose it depends on how you define 'sketchy', though. There are quite a few people here who live rough, many struggling with mental health and substance abuse issues, and there are areas where they congregate. Would you consider those places to be sketchy? There are areas here with people who lean one way or another politically or socially based on signs and flags on homes, businesses, and cars, which of those would you consider sketchy? There's no skid row or seedy back alley black markets that I have found. I can say that I haven't ever really felt unsafe here, certainly nothing like walking through some areas in Seattle for sure. 

As to the traffic in Gorst: it sucks but it's really nothing compared to real traffic in real cities. It's bumper to bumper but it rolls along and is really only small stretch of highway. As other folks mentioned, it kind of kicks off on the afternoon and lasts until early evening.

In regards to martial arts studios: there are a few around, that's all I can say about that.

In regards to the music scene: it's okay, growing post COVID again, but there's also Seattle on the other side of the sound which will have just about all the music you could ever want.  

I know that was a lot, but hopefully it helps you (or someone).

Bremerton is more urban than say, Kingston or Port Orchard. There’s some really nice areas and some really crappy ones.

"Setting aside that unless you saw this person sparking up, you're just using ""tweaker"" as a way of dehumanizing the person: it is exhausting having to explain, over and over, that 9 times out of 10 addiction is the result of homelessness and not the cause of it. Crime is typically the result of homelessness and not the cause of it. And for christ's sake WorkSource will not give you enough money to afford somewhere to live - but it will give you enough money to disqualify you from many of the programs you depend on to survive which means we've built our programs so poorly that once you're out of a home and out of money you're trapped.

Don't ""help them help themselves"", just help them - after a while they'll be standing on their own or they won't and you'll still have done the right thing. ""Help them help themselves"" is just a way to feel like you're already doing enough or that maybe they don't deserve the help if they aren't immediately succeeding. Help them get addiction treatment, medical treatment, housing, and food and don't make any one of those dependent on anything. How do you help? Talk to your representatives about it - local, state, federal. Vote for people that want to do something and do it here instead of shift the homeless problem to the next town over.

And until we're helping them, do what you can to not make their lives worse - up to and including bitching about how affronted you are by their existence. Somebody found somewhere warm to stay on a <40F day? And the place is abandoned property? Then mind your own business. If they're committing crimes you feel are terribly serious then report the crimes and go back to minding your own business. If they're committing so many crimes you can't stand it: *pressure your representatives to do the things that will help these people*. The ""we just need to throw them in jail"" mentality isn't helping anyone and hilariously costs us way more as tax payers and as individuals.

You can check on a child care provider by going to this website FINDCHILDCAREWA dot ORG    When you look up the child provider name.

"Welcome! As someone else mentioned it's a very blue collar area with not a ton going on, but it's growing quickly. As a woman who's lived in larger cities like Seattle, L.A., and Phoenix, Bremerton feels pretty safe to me (granted, there's a good number of tweakers and property crime, but could be worse). Until COVID hit I commuted daily to downtown Seattle via ferry for several years. The state ferry takes about an hour and the fast ferry takes half an hour, though it's much smaller and tends to fill up which you won't experience on the state ferries. State ferry is currently on a reduced schedule with one boat running. Takes some adjusting to but I enjoyed the time for a nap, reading a book, etc. We have Xfinity which works ok enough for remote work and streaming but is not fast by any means. Haven't tried Centurylink but based on negative feedback from others who have it we'll stick with Xfinity. We're very close to fantastic hiking/camping on the peninsula and there are some great parks in town like Evergreen Rotary, the Illahee Preserve, and Lions Park, among others. It's a good town for walking and exploring on foot. There's a Walmart, a couple Safeways, a Fred Meyer, and a Lowe's,  but a 20 min. drive to Silverdale will get you to Target, Costco, Trader Joe's, and some other big box stores. Food & drink recs: Coffee - Cafe Corvo and M&T; food - El Balcon, 4 Sisters, Sebaidee, Axe & Arrow, Khao Soi, La Fermata; drink - Hound & Bottle if you're feeling fancy, Manette Saloon if you're not, Chaos Bay Brewing, Silver City Brewing, Lovecraft Brewing.

"Blue collar to the core. Quiet so don't expect a vibrant night life

For fast internet....it's really gonna be either Centurylink of Xfinity can I really can't recommend either

Xfinity is much more and they don't offer 1gb speeds. We had xfinity up until maybe 6months ago and paid $90 for 500up/500down

We finally moved to centurylink (after having CTL miss their appointments 5 times) and while cheaper ($65) and ""provide"" 1gb I never see that speed. It usually bounces between 400mb - 800mb. It is probably one of the most unstable hardwired connections I've ever been on. Centurylinks service in trying to diagnose it has been a nightmare. I am very very tempted to go back to xfinity.

Also, remote folks, like me, and commuter workers, coming in to push demand on the real estate market with access to enormous swaths of the PNW’s best urban and rural areas within striking distance, being a huge factor. 

Access to the Kitsap and Olympics are just wonderful, and having the cascades, Oregon, and BC in day’s travel by ferry or interstate is incredibly valuable. 

I agree that Seattle has a huge impact on this market. The ability cross the sound by ferry in as little as 30 minutes is just incredible for a variety of reasons, like access to jobs, sports, recreation and culture is a huge impact on the value of real estate in this town.

"i have a friend who lives near that area and she has never had any issues to my knowledge. she is a young woman (early 20s) and has never had any issues with the ppl there. no break-ins, no creepy shit, nothing. so i would say it is pretty safe, just kinda an average neighborhood (as most neighborhoods in bremerton and kistap county tend to be)

areas to avoid: the 7/11 across the street from the Bremerton Housing Authority. it's not close to where you are looking at, but it's in the center of Bremerton. that was the only place my dad (who previously worked in Bremerton) was very insistent that me and my sister NEVER go to. it has a lot of junkies around it, so not a good place for kids. the Bremerton Cinema, i'm pretty sure this is just a gloryhole nowadays. The Charleston, not actually a bad place it's just a place for the punk nightlife (they do like metal / punk concerts) around here, so not appropriate for kids obviously.

schools are decided by zoning in WA so proximity to the public schools decides where your child will attend. in Naval Avenue, your kids will attend the elementary you mentioned, then go to Mountain View Middle School, then to Bremerton High School. all are pretty average, larger schools. you will be in the Bremerton School District. 

overall, bremerton is pretty average. you might struggle with traffic around 8-9 AM and then again at 5-6 because of the shipyard and naval base. try to avoid a job in port orchard if you can because you will stuck in shipyard traffic in Gorst both to and from work if you work average hours.",t2_45buhjy6,Aldrel_TV,0,1631300857.0,0,t1_hcci40s,hcci40s,True,s8wsb,t3_plf64p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bremerton/comments/plf64p/thoughts_on_moving_to_bremerton/,Thoughts on moving to Bremerton,/r/Bremerton/comments/plf64p/thoughts_on_moving_to_bremerton/hcci40s/,3,r/Bremerton,1,3

"Bremerton is not an Island. 

Bought a place well under a mile from Naval Avenue Elementary about a year ago and love it here. We walk through that area regularly and it’s a fine and quiet enough little neighborhood. You can walk to both downtown and also up to Callow pretty easily from there and it’s easy to get anywhere from there by car as well. 

There are rough areas; it’s a city. Break ins aren’t common afaik but crimes of opportunity are (for example: a post on Ring Neighborhood recently shows someone’s shoes being stolen from a rack outside their home, another someone stole a air compressor from someone’s car port). Again, it’s a city and there are plenty of people desperate enough to walk away with someone else’s stuff. 

Most of Bremerton proper is a mixture of single and multi family homes, with a lot of rentals primarily due to the ebb and flow of PSNS staff as the largest employer in the area. That means that I have a few neighbors who recently bought in like me, a few who have lived here for decades, and some are renters that flow in and out all around me. 

I would say we have definitely felt safe here and random violent crime doesn’t seem to happen from what we’ve seen. 

I’ve come from the Midwest. Utilities are generally cheaper than what I was paying there, and that’s based on average costs of harsh winters and hot summers compared to the region’s more moderate climate. You can contact PSE to find out about average / historical pricing as YMMV. I’m paying $50/month promotionally for gigabit that’s meant to go to $70 after promotion expiration. 

Overall we love it here! There’s shabbiness and some spots are a little rough around the edges, and there’s a few spots that are simply rough, but ultimately it’s a great place with plenty to do, see, and enjoy!",t2_47e95grd,fyrephlie,0,1631256463.0,0,t1_hca7vqy,hca7vqy,True,s8wsb,t3_plf64p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bremerton/comments/plf64p/thoughts_on_moving_to_bremerton/,Thoughts on moving to Bremerton,/r/Bremerton/comments/plf64p/thoughts_on_moving_to_bremerton/hca7vqy/,12,r/Bremerton,0,12

"Crime is worse than in surrounding areas, but I imagine that is also because Bremerton is a bit more dense and is only a boat away from the big city. The surrounding areas have very tiny urban centers and only Poulsbo really has a comparable sized downtown and not by much. Even Silverdale is pretty much just a commercial center with houses spread out everywhere. Bremerton from my early youth was notably an abolute shithole but nowadays it's really quite nice and even the worst street in the city (Callow) have cleaned up big time. It's nothing compared to anything you'd see in a big city and is extremely peaceful. 

It is a smaller city so there will be more racism than somewhere like Atlanta, but it is also a navy town so it's still more diverse than most similarly sized towns in the US. If you're black then expect a redneck fuck to yell the hard R at you once or twice in your life from his lifted truck while he speeds off, but its not like a sundown town or anything. Racism is definitely not an accepted thing there but it does happen. 

Also, Bremerton schools are great. The highschool in particular has incredible teachers that care a lot and is very diverse(only 51% white).

"We’ve lived here for 4 years. We moved from AZ, where summer temps would get up to 120, but all the buildings there were built for the desert. Very well insulated, massive central air units, etc. Our home here is 100 years old with poorly insulated walls, attic, windows. I really underestimated how bad temps 90+ could be. Here are some of the ways we’ve kept cool:

- Retreating to our basement. It’s unfinished, dark, and uncomfortable, but it never gets above 80.
- Freezing towels to put on my neck, thighs, chest
- Sitting in front of a fan at all times. No moving around if I can avoid it.
- Escaping to a cooler place during the day, if possible. When it got up to 108 we took the day off work so we could drive to Port Angeles and spend the day on the beach. The water was cold and there was a cool breeze. I almost got chilly.
- When it gets dark: set up a system of fans to suck out the hot air and suck in cool air. This cools down our bedroom in minutes.
- Get blackout curtains. Some folks use cardboard/tinfoil to further insulated/darken windows.

Of course, the best option would be window AC units, but this summer even they’ve been struggling 😬",t2_3avwj9op,goliathgriz,0,1628801459.0,0,t1_h8p9b4m,h8p9b4m,True,[deleted],t3_p34dk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bremerton/comments/p34dk2/dealing_with_the_heat/,Dealing with the heat,/r/Bremerton/comments/p34dk2/dealing_with_the_heat/h8p9b4m/,7,r/Bremerton,0,7

"Hi there! My fiance and I are both Hispanic and have been here for close to a year now. Like most people have said, it's pretty ""live and let live"" here in an introverted way — folks on the street just won't pay you much mind, which has its pros and cons. That will probably be quite different from the more extroverted South, but since you mentioned you're also more introverted it might be right up your alley. As far as overt racism goes we haven't experienced any here, again probably because people here just don't get involved in that way.

West of downtown can a bit more run down than other neighborhoods, but we haven't felt straight up under threat anywhere in town or in all of Kitsap. When they say crime is high, it's definitely in comparison to other parts of Kitsap county. Keep in mind the entire county/peninsula only has 4 bona fide cities in it; Bremerton is the largest and has the most county social services, Salvation Army, rescue missions and those sorts of things, which draws folks who rely on it. Property crime is a thing though, so just don't leave valuables in the car and you'll likely be fine. For what it's worth, I had a job opportunity that would've had us move to Atlanta, but decided against it precisely because crime had shot up so much there. You absolutely will not find crime at that level here. 

It's a predominantly white place like most of Washington, but we're far from being the only folks of color around and I see mixed couples and friend groups all the time. My running path takes me past a Korean church and Sikh temple within a couple of blocks which tells me there's enough of a population here to support those groups. Lions Park is a favorite hangout spot of ours and you'll find a pretty mixed bag of folks playing tennis, basketball, volleyball, or soccer, or just hanging out or walking around the loop. 

Politically it's also mixed, perhaps a slight liberal lean as a whole given that more and more Seattle commuters are moving out this way. We moved at the height of election season and while there was no shortage of political signs, things felt pretty tame here. Wasn't uncommon to see a house with a Trump sign next to one with a BLM or Biden/Harris one, followed by one with the Republican candidate for governor or the thin blue line flag, and another flying the new pride flag. Far as I can tell, everyone's coexisting just fine.

Downtown Seattle is an easy 1 hour ferry ride away, 30 minutes if you leave the car and take the Fast Ferry (though I hear that one sells out quickly), so you won't feel too starved for the big city if you ever want to go.

"It's kind of a southern speak thing :) Someone from Atlanta reading what I said will know what I meant but yeah, I know it's subjective. 

And I'll give the local comfort food scene kudos for being able to find pretty decent southern style catfish here without much difficultly. 

The bbq scene here is better than most of the west coast but ... there really is no southern style bbq here. Good Texas style, good KC style (though I think my St Louis style ribs joint might have died and I can't think of their name right now ... couldn't find them when I Google mapped the right spot tonight). 

But things like fried okra, boiled cornbread, flaky biscuits (sorry, those drop biscuits ain't biscuits, and fast food flaky biscuits barely cut it) etc ... it just doesn't happen up here. 

I've actually had good luck finding collards at my local grocery and making my own ... but finding smoked hocks for it can be a problem. 

I should have said ""southern comfort food"" when I typed that to avoid confusing folks. I agree, everyone has different foods that give them comfort, but there's also a specific genre under that name (and it varies even throughout the south, but there are some staples). 

If you went to a cracker barrel in the 90s, you'd be pretty close to a generic comfort food menu, but missing a lot of things. 

For crawdads I occasionally get them at the Asian buffets but wow it's disappointing. Which is weird I'm that the area grows them really well ... but think they get a bad rap from the availability of other stuff from the open waters.

"Bremerton definitely has your banh mi :)

Food aside, Tacoma is going to be more central to Sound things, has a very good selection of (expensive) house types, and overall is essentially an extension of Seattle with regards to city advantages while still being parking friendly. 

It just depends on what you're looking for. You can definitely do plenty in the Kitsap area, but it's going to me towards the outdoor activities (fishing/boating) than urban life. 

We ended up picking Bremerton because the size of house we need as 2 full time home people + 3 giant dogs & a travel van would have been prohibitive on how much we could afford house-wise. But at this point 5 years later the market is so expensive we wouldn't even have tried for the Sound region. 

If you like road trips and easier access to the coast, Kitsap has big advantages. 

Tacoma population (especially politically) is more on the Seattle side but less extreme. That would have fit me better, too, but I'm not saying Kitsap is bad in any form. Just more Midwest than PNW coast. If you're not already from the area of might actually be the more comfortable transition. 

I'm going to get further political without trying to sound mean ... basically if you would expect less than 10% of Seattle yards with candidate signs to have had a Trump sign last year ... Tacoma would have been around 20% ... Bremerton would have come up another 10% or a bit more. Those are ballpark %s, nothing with direct evidence, just my observations. I'm used to melting pot regions or places where my particular views were in the ineffectual minority so it doesn't affect me much here but it's flat out culture shock sometimes when a Seattleite moves here not realizing the difference.",t2_4htp2,Jahf,0,1628570915.0,0,t1_h8dj83n,h8dj83n,False,korevis,t3_p19v7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bremerton/comments/p19v7a/relocating_research/,Relocating Research,/r/Bremerton/comments/p19v7a/relocating_research/h8dj83n/,2,r/Bremerton,0,2

Food aside, why would you recommend Tacoma over Bremerton? While my office is in Bellevue, I rarely need to be there in person so commuting time really isn’t an issue. Many of the homes in Bremerton go along with the style of house I like (older, smaller homes with some degree of architectural charm left to them), and being able to sit on a porch and look out over the water is pretty appealing.

Kitsap county overall does have a small town feel and there is some of the cons with that. I would still go back if I could just because of how beautiful it is. 

I think if you’re coming from a high crime area you will notice it feeling safer. I came from a town with a lot of crime and homeless people everywhere and Bremerton was a breath of fresh air.  Bremerton gets a bad rap at times from the other towns in Kitsap but…really it’s not bad.

"Bremerton is definitely less foodie than Seattle/Tacoma. But, it has some good places and for food adventuring you can go across the Sound. 

Comfort food is missing from pretty much the entire PNW aside from those I mentioned that occasionally pop up. Overall you're going to have a hard time finding it in a form beyond maybe some generic Cajun. But luckily comfort food is relatively easy to home cook. 

Got any particular types in mind? I'll give you my experiences in that genre. 

You can definitely find good Vietnamese, mostly decent but not great Chinese, good sushi, good Mexican. It's kind of like trying to be foodie in northern California if you go north of Oakland. Less foodie than Denver (which was actually pretty decent on variety). 

For dim sum, weirdly, you need to go to Seattle but if you do ... really good choices. You can get good PNW seafood about anywhere if you look and Poulsbo has a *very good* seafood market in the big grocery store (which is good overall as grocery goes). Though there's far fewer seafood places in Kitsap/Bremerton than you might expect. 

Downtown Seattle often has things like Ethiopian and eastern if you do some research.

 Silverdale (just north of Bremerton) has a decent middle eastern place. Not amazing but authentic. 

I haven't seen a good steak house on this side yet. But that's not so much a foodie goal, especially if you own a good grill. 

I got a bit spoiled by living in Eugene, Oregon for a couple of years before moving here ... per Capita that little city really has options.

"Crime isn't a big problem but there is a bit more late night drug population in the east Bremerton area (I live nearish to Wheaton Way & Riddell Rd). It's actually improved noticeably in the last couple of years with a very few notorious houses being cleaned up a few blocks from this area. Sadly one or two by fires. 

I don't have fear of personal attack when out and about. Regardless of time. People respect the ""Seattle freeze"" and basically ignore each other. Has good and bad sides.

I'm white, male and 50 so yeah, I get I'm privileged. I have a friend who is a housemate (rents a room) who is early 30s, biracial with overall black appearance. He relocated here from Springfield, OR. 

Overall he prefers it here from there. His feeling is Bremerton > Springfield regarding how people have treated him ... but ... similar to what I've felt he also gets fewer positive experiences. It's just more neutral here. 

He most definitely has encountered people who treat him ""less"" versus interactions with other people around him in the same circumstances. As in people who will cold shoulder him yet talk to me like a human (not realizing we're friends). Mostly in the more suburban area outside the city limits ... which sucks as he's been working a convenience store gig in one of those areas. He's about to start working full-time at the navy yard and has actually been pretty happy working there in the past. 

Bringing that up because a lot of people around here will say the issue is the navy yards bringing in more conservative types but, in my experience, navy folks are some of the more open minded (serve on a ship and you learn how to get along). There's simply an older population of rednecks that like having an excuse shield. 

PS. I grew up in Kansas, lived a decade in Alabama, regularly visit Ok and Tx to see relatives, and moved here in 2013. I definitely get to call out redneck behavior when I see it. 

And I'll further add ... you can find better racial social integration on the east side of the Sound. But you can also definitely find worse. Overall I'll stick to considering Bremerton / Silverdale / Poulsbo relatively neutral.

Edit: further guidance ... Port Orchard is also with considering but will add to her commute to Poulsbo. I'd avoid anything further south or west, and find the Shelton region wouldn't suit you (sorry Shelton folks). But coming from Atlanta (unless things are different there than they were up through around 2000 when I left the area) I don't think you'll have any problems in the area. 

You're not going to find much in the way of good comfort food in this area. It tends to pop up for awhile then fade away (especially during covid).

"The County Government is first and foremost responsible for evicting Kitsap Rescue Mission in order to host rummage sales in the pavilion. No question there.

But Kitsap Rescue Mission has a long history of shady operating. Consider:

1. They were illegally operating out of a declared fire hazard building without sprinklers on 6th street. They were given, by their own admission, months and months, extension after extension, to make repairs by installing sprinklers but didn't do so. So the fire marshal evicted them and the county was forced to take them at the pavilion. Completely avoidable if KRM had done what was legally required.
2. Workers have accused Managers of active racism against residents and employees, in one recent case by employing the N-word. After investigating, the accused manager offered their resignation but KRM Executive Director Olsten defended the manager stating, ""I saw value in her, she was very good with our guests and I believe that she needed to become more aware, she needed to become more racially sensitive and to gain some understanding around that."" As a result, both African American workers quit, one on medical leave and noted this was not an isolated incident of racism.
3. In 2018 the Mission [took in $870,000 in donations](https://ae733d3e-0da7-429a-a5c2-23e45047de52.filesusr.com/ugd/9379e9_c68ae0f566a444628e80e7bf9fb1937a.pdf) and spent fully $422,000 on salaries (or fully 49%) on themselves. Given they housed at max 26 people on any night they could have just employed each houseless person with a salary of $33,000 and been far more effective.
4. The Mission could have declined this move, knowing the catastrophic impact it would have on Midway Inn residents, and negotiated beds for every single pavilion resident at the newly opened 72-apartment Pendleton Place for homeless people. Why didn't it? Because then the Mission wouldn't have control over their residents. Instead, they get to cram them into the Midway Inn, take away their TVs, kick out anybody with pets, and minister Jesus to them.

The Mission had choices. And they've continuously made the wrong ones.

Also, it is literally illegal to not allow service animals, and the shelter says no ""pets,"" not no service animals. But yes, this family's life would be unsustainable with the shelter there, so they are essentially being evicted.

"Lol, Bremerton isn’t this bad. It’s got this weird rep because goofy suburban people have never actually lived anywhere that was actually bad and think that homeless people = getto. Town has been around forever and most places on the west side were originally naval housing sold to the town then inherited by slum lords who just wanna rent. So that’s why a lot of the west side downtown looks dilapidated. It’s been improving overall since I’ve been born lol. East side has tons of neighborhoods constructed during the 80s and 90s and parents are finally paying off mortgages so it’s relatively quiet and people have nice cars

Bremerton is just like most other small-to mid sized town. The east side is considered “better” but it’s just suburbs. 

Area businesses have it hard because a lot of people simply pass through to use the ferry, and a quarter of the population leaves every time a ship or sub goes out. So unless you got a solid business, you just gonna waste money.

"You want safe neighborhoods you gotta pay for em. 

Poulsbo/Silverdale are close to Bremerton and within most commuting distances, but cost more than Bremerton. 

Bremerton isn’t too horrible on crime, it’s mostly petty break-ins, theft, that sort of thing. But still, not a great place to settle down anymore. Lots of long stretches of abandoned storefronts filled with needles/homeless. If you HAVE to live in Bremerton live in East Bremerton. It’s the better half of the city. West Bremerton is by far the most ghetto. 

If it’s doable, check out Belfair. It’s about 20 minutes outside of Bremerton but much more peaceful/rural/country kind of setting. Not a lot to do, but that also means less crime. Plus it’s much more affordable than Silverdale/Poulsbo. 

Silverdale is basically a corporate shopping town. They’ve got most basic corporate business there. I lived there for a few years. It’s nice, but you get tired of living “in the city” real quick. 

Poulsbo is a Viking themed town north of Silverdale, about 20 minutes outside of Bremerton. Cute street front stores and fantastic local parks. A quintessential summer walking town that’s really adorable, but quite pricey.

"That's both cool, but also potentially disappointing. Their business model is very simple right now and really successful as a result. Like, yes the food is great, but the tacos and burritos work because it's inexpensive takeout. If they want to have a more sit-down El Balcon experience that's fine, I don't have a problem with that per se, I like their food so I'll give it a try regardless, but I'd love to not lose the inexpensive take-out side of things.

"I really hope this transition works for them and yes I'm dreaming of beers and papusas, but I can't help but worry that we're losing a great thing.

El Balcon's current space allows them to basically be a stationary taco truck, and moving in to the old BB&G place means that they'll have to change their entire business model. Most of the food they're really popular for (Mission style burritos) doesn't really lend itself well to a sit-down dining experience. I'm worried that they'll have to drastically rework their menu in order to make that space work for them, and the to-go nature of their food is probably what makes them the most money being in prime range of shipyard lunch breaks.

Who knows, though, they could change their entire menu for the better and make a solid sit-down dining spot.

"You may have a better luck at Chinese places. They sell congee. I haven’t seen a Korean restaurant besides BonJook that sells jook and that was in Los Angeles. Possibly because it’s something people eat only when they are feeling weak? If you have a rice cooker or slow/pressure cooker, you are all set. Throw a cube of chicken bouillon (or chicken drumsticks), finely chopped vegetables, and 2-3 times the water that you need to add to the same amount of rice for making regular rice, and run it at brown rice mode (longer cooking time).
