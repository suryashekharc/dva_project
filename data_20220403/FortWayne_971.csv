There are a lot of quality neighborhoods throughout the ‚Äò08, the ‚Äò05, and the ‚Äò02 as well, and they are considered central too.

"School counselor here: the school did you a disservice by not contacting you and the other parents. That should have been first response.

A manifest determination might be held, but because autism is a disability that impacts social functioning, they will likely find the behavior is a result of his disability and he will be allowed to remain in school. It is not that we want the child to ‚Äúoffend‚Äù but we are legally required to continue his educational services. An aid is sometimes an option, but many schools do not have the funding to provide a 1:1 aid at all times. I know the situation will never be ideal, and it is probably terribly frustrating, but the best option may be to remove your daughter. Reteaching of boundaries and social behavior does not happen over night, so your resolution may not come quickly. Often times it is not that we don‚Äôt want to help, we only have so many options and resources. 

A police report is probably a good option. I‚Äôve seen restraining orders in schools, and because the school building is so small, they usually aren‚Äôt helpful. They will come in contact at some point in passing. 

You can seek counseling for your daughter if you perceive that this is impacting her social-emotional health. This is also a good opportunity to teach consent and how to respond when someone does not respect our boundaries.",t2_16ymnv,longlivthequeen,0,1648991416.0,0,t1_i37wrk5,i37wrk5,False,sippydippylippy,t3_trb9mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortwayne/comments/trb9mt/looking_for_an_attorney_for_elementary_school/,Looking for an attorney for Elementary School sexual assault,/r/fortwayne/comments/trb9mt/looking_for_an_attorney_for_elementary_school/i37wrk5/,1,r/fortwayne,0,1

You pay them a membership fee and then you get drugs at wholesale cost or something. If you have several prescriptions or one pretty expensive one, it can be worth it.

"That didn't ring true so I did some digging.

> [Put another way, the study estimated the cost of production for a vial of human insulin is between $2.28 and $3.42, while the production cost for a vial of most analog insulins is between $3.69 and $6.16, according to the study in BMJ Global Health.](https://www.businessinsider.com/insulin-prices-could-be-much-lower-and-drug-makers-would-still-make-healthy-profits-2018-9)

With ""official"" inflation numbers, that'd be $2.58 to $6.96 now. ~~That's just the raw cost to produce. That doesn't include quality control efforts, liability insurance, administrative costs, legal fees, regulatory costs, storage and distribution costs, and sales/marketing efforts. Those are all necessary in the current legal climate.~~ (EDIT: some or all of those are in the listed cost-per-vial, supposedly.)

That said, I can't imagine that those costs would add more than $10 to $15 per vial. Price it at $26 to $44 ($23 to $39 in 2018 Dollars...) per vial for somewhere around 50% profit and that's a solid plan which accounts for the potential of massive legal liabilities when selling something which will be injected into people.

I also know that my sister's insulin costs went way up when she stopped getting the bottles and moved to dispensers. I assume that accounts for some of the perceived (or real?) problems here.

I did some more digging and found that there's really no natural competition in the production of insulin. Fucking patents? Really? gg government... SMH...

"Your point appeared to be that taxpayers were being swindled and funneling money out of state. I'm pointing out that the cost of service has proved to be greater than the price agreed on, and the drain you see is not really there.

Indiana municipal code requires us to reward the contract to the lowest bidder. If a local company could and wanted to do it for cheaper, great, but none was interested. Local government had no choice in this matter. All because of a part of code targeted at anticorruption, oddly enough.

If we wanted to do it at a local government level, we just need to accept that is going to be more expensive. What these garbage companies have that we do not is economies of scale.

I think it is totally possible to be successful, then overextend, screw up, and lose a lot of money.

"Here's are my thoughts:

Special education students are entitled due to federal law, to the least restrictive environment.   That means an autistic student, who struggles with personal space, will be able to stay in the classroom - due to the LRE.

FERPA (federal!) prevents schools from providing information on punishment to students.

Ossian was on Spring Break, a week ago.  Right?  I have taught, and NO ONE wants to be in a school building on Spring Break.   Not only that spring testing is happening, and your complaint is way down on the list.  (I have friends who are in Ossian's schools.)

What can you do?

Going to the police is NOT going to help.   Why?   Ossian Police and Wells Co. Sherriff Dept. all back Northern Wells.

A lawyer will side with Sp. Ed. law.

You might want to:

Express the concerns to the superintendent in written form.  Computer typed letter that is snail-mailed to the superintendent.     I would write ""My daughter is in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_'s class, and my daughter \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, along with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, has experessed concern about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ inappropriately touching them.

I am concerned about the well-being of (autistic student).   Next year, my daughter will be a 6th grader at Norwell Middle School, along with the other students.   While I don't give my daughter permission to defend herself, I tell her to get adult help, I know not everyone shares my values and viewpoints!  Thus, the (austic student) may touch a person and might get hurt.

How can we resolve it?   Would you be able to hire an aide for him?

If this is not solved, I will be transferring my daughter to St. Al's in Yoder, Bluffton Middle School, or Belmont.    I will be encouraging other parents to follow me.

Sincerely,

"I went for a bachelor in Music Technology. it was a great field for me and i actually loved the professors, but the first and second year of the music program are used to essentially ‚Äúweed out‚Äù the people who arent going to make it through.

"\^\^\^ This. There's a lot of jobs you can take that'll actually provide something for the community. (Or at least the net neutral that you can't escape from under the dogshit current job market)  


Can't see a lot in a cursory look that'll be relevant to the old role but that is both unsurprising and probably for the best given.   


There's also a ton of non-profits and community aid in the city that could always use more assistance.   


Until you find something solid for yourself, instacart and stuff are popular but of course all of those jobs will shaft you.   
Shiftsmart is an app you can get that'll basically put you in random shifts with companies that sign up. It's a little slow but you'll see a shift or two to look at daily.

"I didn't have a great experience here, at least for interior. My car was a hot mess (not as bad as some of the more wild YouTube videos but it had it's fair share of French fries and sticky stuff spilled on the all weather floor mats). 

The cabin was clean and detailed and everything was smooth and shiny but there were still stains on the floor mats. 

The big thing that bothered me was that I paid the max amount for a full interior detailing only to be told it was a 4 hour cleaning and then found out that they only spent about 3.5 hours on it. Also, they completely ignored the front trunk (Tesla) and the extra compartment in the trunk.

She did give me a book about marriage once that turned out to be a lot more churchy/preachy than I expected, but she didn't take issue with it when I said I read the first couple chapters and didn't think it was a good fit for me.

Why do the poorest of the poor use the emergency room as a doctor's office? Because it's free to them. They sure as shit wouldn't be doing it if they cared about the resulting bill, which would be huge.

Adding to housing supply, even with newer, more expensive units, still adds to supply. Some of the people who move in here will open up other units of similar quality or one level down in the hierarchy, and then other people can upgrade into those units, and so on. 

Yesterday's pricier new housing typically becomes tomorrow's mid-range and affordable housing as it gets older, as tastes change, etc.

"I've lived in numerous places/states. I'm from Virginia, moved here December of 2020.

Hands down, Fort Wayne is awful.

Grey is the only word that comes to mind when I think of the personality types that make Fort Wayne.
The food is tasteless, the roads are horrid, what people here consider to be nice areas to live are awful compared to what I've considered to be nice.
Don't even ask about how aggressive and defensive drivers are here. How personally they take anyone wanting to get around them properly. And don't ask about the awful train tracks and the lack of actual schedule.
If you're from here and you don't know any better then sure.. the nostalgia and 'if we know you we love you' mentality exists. But its not welcoming by any stretch of the word.
I noticed someone stated that they wondered how many people actually lived elsewhere long enough to compare it to someplace else... well I have and so has my fianc√© who's actually from here. Moving back has been a mistake and a massive let down. Maybe you people should try living elsewhere for that same comparison?
Cheap and affordable isn't enough of a reason to mark Fort Wayne as a top place to live. Because cheap and affordable leaves plenty of room for poverty and people with half broken down cars with zero fucks given.
Oh, lastly, redlights are quite optional 'round these parts. Just sayin.
So come grab a hot dog since those are the holy grail and prepare yourself for the let down of the century.
Be sick of the hate all you want.. comparing it to shittier places doesn't make it any less shitty. Maybe the least of the compared evils.
