"Full disclosure: I'm biased because I go there.  

Karate-Do Academy has outstanding instructors and is very reasonably priced.  Adults from white belt up typically go into their own special class combined with advanced older teens.  There a a fair number of older adults (I am in my mid-40s and would say I'm in the middle).

OP, here's my advice.  Go to each of the schools/dojo and ask to do a class or two to see if you like it. They should get you to sign a waiver, but ANY good school should be happy to do.  If they don't, or they try and pressure you, that's not a good school.  Good luck and have fun, whichever you choose!

Karate Places:

* Karate-Do Academy
* Blue Dragon Karate Downtown
* YMCA (no sparring, very good instruction though)

Tae-Kwon-Do

* Fire Dragon

Misc

* Resilience Jiu Jitsu (formerly Element --> really good school)
* Med Hat Judo Club --> I've also heard good things, although someone else told me Judo very hard on the body for older people.
* There is a boxing club, I believe located in the old school near overpass (Kiwanis Center?)

I was a little miffed at how something stupid like that had even managed to happen in the first place and how they basically destroyed my phone in the process but the guy I dealt with was very professional and courteous throughout the whole ordeal, calling me every day on my landline to give me updates and in the end he didn't charge me a cent for the ""repairs"" or labour. In fact, they paid me $30 to buy the phone off of me to salvage the remaining parts that still functioned, which I really appreciated. Ended up getting a special offer from my service provider and got a newer phone for cheaper afterwards so everything worked out in a way in the end.

If you broke your screen and they fixed it, but the sensor doesn't work after, you're being the jerk here. They made your ipad functional again and now you're refusing to pay. That sounds like fraud on your part - to me.

"The theology and philosophy of life and when it starts its an absolutely beautiful topic that can be discussed endlessly. As a person with no mainstream religions beliefs I always lean towards the science first and foremost. However there is still many many things that science has yet to find answers for with the human body alone, which I find so intriguing in its own right. Now, I don't believe that a lack of answer to a question defaults it to magic or faith, but as a species, humanity wants to find answers and connections and patters, so theology is more than able to fit those gaps respectfully. Just as much as I support pro choice, etc etc, I also support freedom of belief. If a person can find answers in faith, and those answers do not infringe upon the beliefs and rights of others, they go for it. It's when a person chooses to believe that their beliefs are the only correct ones that exist, and they force that idea upon others that I take offense. I will always fight for peoples right to decide and make choices (vaccine, birth control, assisted suicide) and everyone has a right to believe what they want avout these topics, even discuss them freely, but no one has the right to tell a person that a personal belief is right or wrong in my opinion anyways lol

"Pro life does not mean pro choice. Pro life is at the root the belief that all life is sacred (human in this case) and starts at conception, which drives the anti abortion belief. Fetus is alive,   abortion is taking said life away. Pro life isn't directly related to pro vaccine either, in fact given that the majority of pro life followers beliefs are strongly rooted within faith and religion, I would suspect that statistically it would be shown that pro life and and anti Vax often coincide. Now this is is no way a blanket statement that says all pro life are anti Vax, or pro choice is pro Vax, as there is always outliers.

I'm a 47 year old dude and I have 2 daughters. I support pro choice and I always have. The problem with medicine hat...and most of southern alberta... is we are in the Bible belt and there is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes almost akin to lobbying to keep this area pro life.  It's the same people who were against legal weed and strip joints.

"My kid worked in a family support role and she HATED Avenue Living with a passion. So many stories of them screwing people. Her complex got bought up by them and she was gone the second her lease was up.   


Best bet is to find a private landlord - someone with a few properties here or there because Avenue Living are mostly buying up whole complexes and not individual condos.

"What’s your physical ailment you’re trying to fix? 

I’d recommend Dustan at cypress sports physical therapy. I’ve gone to him for 3+ years now. Has helped me make massive strides with mobility and taking care of myself throughout the week (desk job + gym 6x a week). 

I’m not here to knock the entire profession of chiropractors, but I highly recommend finding a good physiotherapist. In my experience Physio will help you fix the issue while also learning how to prevent future problems. Chiro fixed you just enough until your next appointment.

"When I talked to him and asked why he voted for a blatantly homophobic position and he said. “I believe this bill can lead to a slippery slope. Where if someone is questioning their sexuality they can’t go to a therapist for help. Then if they would go it could put said therapist at risk.”

Like no motz getting therapy to figure out your sexuality vs going to conversion therapy are 2 completely different things.

One helps you figure out what best works for you and the other one tells you being gay is bad and to be ashamed of it.

Glen motz is a moron. I went to his rally back in 2016 when I was 15. There was 8 people there, all family and friends. I went as a kid who wanted to be involved. I asked 3 questions 

1.) what is your thoughts on the current economic dependence on natural gas/oil for Alberta. 
And how would you best deal with it.

Answer - “invest more into oil”

2.) do you have any proposed support for climate initiatives.

Answer - “it’s too early in the race to say anything”

(His mother or auntie or someone started verbally attacking me after I said this.)

3.) Do you believe the conservatives have lost touch with the youth?

Answer - “well you’re here aren’t you.”

My rebuttal - “not to support you Glen.”

"Privileges: 1.

Not being immunocompromised or other conditions that would cause covid to be a serious threat to life. 4. Not being in a high risk profession such as healthcare where you are constantly exposed to varying varients and constantly around infected people who could infect you with each of the variants, or by having multiple patients with different varients becoming infected with multiple strains at the same time. Same with Teaching and being a student as you are in a confined space with multiple people.

"I’m so sorry this has been happening to you guys too. :( I live here in Ottawa and a subset of these useful idiots have been honking incessantly in the neighbourhoods near Parliament. The honking can’t be heard in Parliament (which is why people typically protest on foot on the hill - as some people are) but a handful of these remaining big truck anarchists have kept at it. 

So many of us were so outraged at our police force failing to arrest the anarchists in the truck that we had honestly been thinking of organizing a freedom counter protest where we drive from
Ottawa to Medicine Hat and honk incessantly outside of Tamara Lich’s house “until Justin Trudeau resigns”. 

But now that I’ve read that you guys are suffering as a result of these idiots I take that back and feel terrible that six days of almost nonstop honking with train horns has driven me to that kind of hatred for my fellow Canadians. :(.

"**UCP passed Bill 1 in June 2020** explicitly for these types of situations. Of course, that was when it was First Nations protesting, not hillbillies & truckers, so I guess the bill only applies in certain situations.  /s

From gov't of AB website:

*Bill 1 protects essential infrastructure by creating offences for trespassing, interfering with operations or causing damage.* 

**Quotes from the UCP in February 2020:**

*“The right to protest does not include being able to prevent your neighbours from getting to work and putting food on the table, or threatening their security. Albertans expect their government to deal with lawlessness and stand up for the values that all law-abiding citizens share. This government is doing just that.”*  
  
*- Jason Kenney, Premier*  
   
*“Over the last number of weeks, Albertans have witnessed the level of economic damage that a small group of lawbreakers can cause through blockades and other illegal protests. Our government will not stand idly by and allow Alberta to be an economic hostage to illegal activity now or ever. The Critical Infrastructure Defence Act will help protect our way of life by ensuring the rule of law is upheld and the infrastructure that is critical to our province’s economy can continue to operate.”*

"My wife was stuck behind a convoy on her way to Calgary last night. Both lanes of the number one were blocked, and they were traveling 15km/h. I asked her if she phoned 911 and she told me it would be pointless as the police were sitting on the side of the highway doing nothing.

Once she was able to get clear of the convoy, three semis that were boxed in with her sped up as fast as possible to try to make up for lost time.

"TLDR; Racism can only be fought by talking to people who are racist. Not by demonizing them as evil.

As many as I have too in life. Because if you never talk to these people like actual people. They will never listen too your viewpoint and maybe realize that they are in the wrong about that viewpoint. It may not happen for every viewpoint, but if you leave these people to live in their own little bubble. It will just cement that viewpoint. 

Racism exists because a person was hurt in some way and they need someone too blame. Easier too blame a large group of people you probably seldom have to interact with than deal with that pain and even recognize they have it. So rather than treating someone with different viewpoints as evil. I'll treat them like I would any other person and tell them I disagree with that viewpoint, but I can understand why they feel that way. Then proceed to explain to them why I disagree with them. Which isn't just ""It's wrong."" Because they clearly don't think so. It's because that the people they are hating on have never actually done anything wrong to them personally. They like that person is just trying to live their life and do what they can. If they wish to continue having that view point it's up too them. 

Trying to control and tell someone they are wrong for having a viewpoint is futile. Also authoritarian in nature. Telling them why that viewpoint may be wrong can work.",t2_7nie9gwh,Ill_Management3250,0,1643683951.0,0,t1_hv2zr34,hv2zr34,False,InstantMystic007,t3_sfpl4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinehat/comments/sfpl4o/gathering_of_idiots_this_was_left_on_my_car/,Gathering of idiots.

"I was born and raised in Medicine Hat, I left for Lethbridge for school at 20 years old and then moved to Calgary when I was 22. I've said for a while now that Medicine Hat is the perfect place to grow up. From K-9 I was able to walk to school, our neighbourhood had block parties, played lots of sports and took music lessons. 

When the novelty of being 18 wore off and going out to Ralph's or the Rona became redundant is when I started to sour on Medicine Hat. There isn't much to do if you're in the ""party"" stage of your life.  


But now 7 years later my perspective has changed. Living in Calgary for 3.5 years now and I can't stand it. Zero sense of community, don't see my neighbours, ever. The few friends my partner and I do have are all 20-30 minute drives away so we rarely see them. We're actually planning on moving to Medicine Hat in the Summer. So I think Medicine Hat is a great community to live in just depending on what stage of life you're at. I'd probably encourage most high school or college grads to venture out as I did to learn what they value or like in a community/city. But I couldn't be more excited to return.",t2_1nj3bqie,overzealous96,0,1643325119.0,0,t1_hui9icr,hui9icr,True,Saidanest,t3_sau45n,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicinehat/comments/sau45n/whats_your_opinion_on_the_hat_good_place_to_live/,Whats your opinion on the Hat?

"Well I simply disagree with this being a freedom of choice issue. In most cases, yes, freedom of choice is ideal. I don't care if people get the flu shot or not. 

But nearly every public health authority in the world has said that getting the Covid shot is a matter of public health and safety. So in this case, your personal choice has an impact on public health.

"Have you talked to people living in remote areas and small towns who recieve one truck delivery of goods a month about supply chain issues? There's lots of comments on the Alberta thread about not having certain items in a grocery store in months and running low on baby formula. To me this mandate has no benefit to canadians. Truckers drive alone, often sleep alone in thier sleeper cab, and see very few people, who they see outside. I don't think they're spreading too much covid so what is the benefit here? It doesn't make sense.

A vaccine requirement for a select group of people I don't think is highly likely to make a big, huge difference in the short-to-medium term,"" said Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious diseases specialist and associate professor at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.

90% of our fruit and vegetables come from the US and those prices have risen in the last week. This mandate has no benefit to Canadians, only negative consequences. So why mandate it now when it never has been this whole pandemic. I don't know about you but I never heard an argument or concern about truck drivers spreading covid before this.

"Peterbilt, usually the nicest and most durable trucks, can be $300,000 new but most people buy used which you can get for $200,000 or less and most likely financed. I doubt they live in a $700,000 house. The reason I bring up US stats is because US drivers deliver to Canada and with only 60% of truckers allowed in, fruit prices from Arizona and California jumped 25% in Canada last week. They are, in fact, doing it for each other. Lots of vaccinated truckers from the US are coming up to meet the convoy when they're further out east. I don't understand why Trudeau would mandate this now when truckers have been driving back and forth this entire pandemic without a vaccine mandate and now when the countries have the highest vaccine rate he is now mandating it and increasing food prices when inflation is already a disaster in the country. In my opinion, this move to mandate truckers coming in does not benefit Canadians.

"If you’re straight out of high school with good marks it’s not too difficult to get a seat in the program. But if you already have post secondary studies it can be more difficult. 

Best bet is to enter as a general studies student and take a bunch of electives that could get you placed into the 2nd year of the program. By that time there’s usually quite a few nurses who quit or drop/flunk out and get held back, so there’s seats to fill. If you have the required courses done and have decent marks you get one of those seats. Had several friends do this. Talk to one of the academic advisors with the college and they can hook you up; tell you which courses to enrol in to give you a high GPA as well. 

Course load is pretty heavy. First year is a bunch of intro sciences and other electives, with the hardest course being anatomy and physiology.
