"“Poor state” refers to the state revenue, not the individual residents’ discretionary income. 

According to KOB, there were 29,191 transactions for recreational cannabis on Friday, totaling $1,969,113.69. That’s an average of $67 and change per transaction. 

NM has a population of just over 2 million. So approximately 3% of the population purchased recreational marijuana on Friday, and those folks spent, on average, $67. 

Pretty sure we’re still a “poor state,” but hopefully this will be a step in the direction of correcting that.

ETA: tax on those purchases is 12%. The state made roughly $240k on the first day, and that’s why I say that this is hopefully a step in the right direction, but it absolutely does not make us a wealthy state.",t2_5iiigp6e,alphabetfire,0,1648967618.0,0,t1_i371cmq,i371cmq,False,boxermansr,t3_tux1tc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/tux1tc/new_mexicos_marijuana_sales_soar_high_over_36/,New Mexico's marijuana sales soar high - over $3.6 million and counting,/r/Albuquerque/comments/tux1tc/new_mexicos_marijuana_sales_soar_high_over_36/i371cmq/,34,r/Albuquerque,0,34

"So I can get a $10-30 takeout meal to score a ""free"" 4-cent bag? Some people never had to be frugal, and it shows. Also, have you ever seen the bags dry-cleaners use? They can't be reused for just about anything except as small drop cloths. I also don't have clothes that need to be dry-cleaned, and rarely eat out because of the expense. Maybe you can also stop acting like everybody has loads of money to waste.

I agree I worded my previous statement poorly. Instead of saying bag bans prevent people from ""using"" them, I should have pointed out that it keeps people from having an easily available supply.

One of the main reasons people support the bag ban is that they think it will reduce the amount of plastic being used/consumed in general.

"I would recommend doing the park and ride. Its a shuttle bus from a designated spot with parking and includes your ticket to the event.It’s a bit more per person but worth it for the convince and less stress. You get dropped off right at the entrance gate and then you can hop on the shuttle back to your car. The streets to get into the fiesta get very congested and are slow going and the shuttles are given private access. 

Dress warm! Morning events are typically very cold, so dressing in layers along with a beanie and gloves is suggested.

"Avoid La Ventana apartments too. They make it very convenient to move in.. but when it’s time to move out no one can return an email, can’t find paperwork, and then try charging you an arm and a leg to move out. We had a six month contract, tried to move out early, was willing to pay for the whole contract.. no one would respond to us. Finally after the 6 month contract was up we got a bill stating we owed 6k for our final bill.. After reviewing our contract with them and realizing there was no reason they should be charging us 6k we told them no. They threatened to sue us, then put a court summon on the apt door which we didn’t live at anymore (found it just by chance), then went to court. The judge went through the signed agreement and thankfully sided with us saying they were in the wrong. We still paid 1800 but still a hell of a lot less…

"Edibles are great. Convenient and no smell. 
My problem with edibles is the come up time. I’m impatient and sometimes think I didn’t take enough(the classic edibles etiquette) and end up eating way more then anticipated. I also find the high much different then smoking or vaping, it is a much more “mellow” high until you take too much. 

My personal recommendation. Pre. Rolls. 
Pre rolls are great if you really want to try barebones weed without buying fancy equipment or trying to roll your own. You get the full experience. 
You’ll end up feeling it mid way through smoking the joint. The only downside is you smell like smoke/weed and your throat becomes a bit irritated from hot smoke but have a glass of water with you and you’ll be fine. 
This to me is the OG, the one that started it all. You know the saying, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. They wouldn’t still be selling them if people didn’t like them. 

The king, the holy grail, the bong. 
This can come at a hefty price and I highly recommend saving this beauty for later down the line if you’re still interested. 


If I’m gonna be honest here, head into a dispensary and ask around. Its your best bet as most of us here won’t be able to check the strains available near you to recommend anything. 
I’d walk in and just be honest with the budtender. Say “hey, I’m new to weed and was wondering about some recommendations or just a bit of information” and they’ll gladly help. It’s almost an honour to help someone who’s new get into the scene, we take great pride in that. I take great pride in introducing my friend to bongs as that was his introduction to weed. Still to this day its my greatest stoner accomplishment. 

If you go down the road of pre rolls, I personally don’t recommend smoking the entire thing. Try about half the joint, put it out and see how you feel as you can always smoke more but you can’t unsmoke more. None the less, hope you enjoy your time, would love to hear how it goes, cheers.",t2_aj0z3bk7,wheredidiputmybong,0,1648860921.0,0,t1_i31zhci,i31zhci,True,fortranately,t3_tt9msg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Albuquerque/comments/tt9msg/im_an_older_person_and_would_like_to_try_cannabis/,I'm an older person and would like to try cannabis for the first time tomorrow.

"Thank you for touching on how poverty is relative. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for genuine improvement no matter the current standard because why would anyone logical oppose that?

Gang culture wouldn't have anything to do with it if course.

"That was almost four times as much new money as had been created during the two years that preceded the pandemic and, to some Fed critics, explains why the United States is experiencing its highest inflation since 1982. All that money chasing after limited supplies of goods such as cars, computers and furniture is inevitably bidding up prices, they say.

____________________

Inflation is caused when the money supply in an economy grows at faster rate than the economy’s ability to produce goods and services. In our auction economy the production of goods and services was unchanged, but the money supply grew from round one to round two. Because the money supply grew, and the output of goods and services did not grow, our economy experienced inflation.

______________________

This change in strategy opened the gates for an excessively expansive monetary policy after a decade of rather subdued inflation. When the pandemic hit, the Fed engaged in massive quantitative easing through the purchase of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities that resulted in 25% money growth. These actions were flanked by direct lending by the Fed to the public under a dozen Section 13(3) facilities.

Just as Friedman predicted, prices reacted with a lag. At the end of 2021, producer prices were soaring at a rate of nearly 10% and consumer prices were rising at over 7% year over year.

"That can't be done, they're fundamentally different concepts with enormously different requirements:

A repaired broken window can remain repaired for hundreds of years with a single investment of a relatively trivial amount of time & money.

As an example 50# of soya based vegetable shortening is now $105 compared to $40 pre pandemic. Surprisingly, butter is about $135 for 55lbs. So, if the owner is paying much more for his ingredients he really doesn't have a choice. Add in his rent increase, insurance increase, the packaging increase and everything else that has gone up since the pandemic and you get the picture. Hopefully, this will return to more normal levels, but that won't happen for another couple of years.

"So when Anthony Fauci who has never treated a single patient in his life says, ""I AM the science"", he's not being authoritarian, but when Trump deferred to his judgment, and did whatever he and Dr. Birx suggested, it was actually \*Trump\* who was authoritarian. Got it. 

And when Biden tried to push mandatory vaccination as part of an OSHA Executive Order, that *wasn't* authoritarian. It also wasn't lying or gaslighting when he did that after promising he wouldn't do it just months earlier.

And when all these Dem governors and mayors shut down their states and cities, it was the Republicans being authoritarian. Riiight. \[Not saying the Republican governors didn't do their fair share; I'm pretty pissed at them too, but on average, it was more D than R that did it.\]

And when far-left Big Tech aligns with the Biden administration (and before that, alignsed against Trump) to shut down any dissent or any contradictory opinions, that's all hunky-dory, because ""forcible suppression of opposition"" is bad only when it's NOT the far-left doing it. Thanks for explaining that to me.

I think everyone should be opposed to anarchism, because it would be the most miserable way to live. Anybody could shoot you and nobody would care. Anybody could rob you blind, and you'd have no recourse, other than to hunt him down and take your stuff back, probably maiming or killing him in the process. You would have only the stuff you could personally defend and/or steal, and no more. Absolute misery.

Pure democracy works well in small instances but it doesn't work well for long. Being opposed to the Democrat party and being opposed to democracy are two different things. I noticed that the people of NM did not get to vote on the Dem. guv's shutdown orders; they were just forced to comply. Oh, I forgot, it was the Republicans who are authoritarian, not the Dems....

Similarly, Marxism has failed every place it's been tried, even Jamestown, because it fails to understand and take into account human nature.

As for the election, yeah, why on earth would anybody doubt that an 80-y/o bumbling, mumbling white guy who couldn't draw flies to his campaign stops, would get more votes in certain (but only certain) key districts, including getting more votes in some majority-black districts than did Barack Obama?

"My experience with edibles has been great. Since it's your first time, go slow and be patient. Edibles can take some time before you feel any effect. I'd start with 3-5 milligram of something you like. There are drinks, gummies, chocolate bars...all kinds of edibles. The drinks are ""fast acting"" which means you'll feel the effect in about 30 minutes.  


Another way to get edibles working faster is to eat something with a lot of fat in it. Potato chips, KFC, Whoppers, those types of foods with a lot of fat work best. This is because THC, which is the chemical that gets you high, is fat soluble so it mixes with the fat in your stomach and gets moving faster.
