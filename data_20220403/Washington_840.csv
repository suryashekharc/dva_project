"Imagine it was super easy, barely an inconvenience to kidnap someone and take them across the border to Canada, which is illegal in both places. Now, in Washington, you're reported as missing, but making that a priority for Canada is actually a serious issue. You need embassies involved without preestablished channels, and even existing channels are going to produce low urgency work. After all, it's a Washington citizen missing, not a Canadian citizen and that missing person ain't gunna vote for the MP that prioritizes them. Washington has no proof that the person went to Canada, so there's no international incident. And sure, it just so happens that Washington has higher missing rates than Oregon where there's no international border, but hey, those Washingtonians are always cra-cra.

In business, we'd call this silo'ing, and it's a huge problem. Also makes for a good deal of malicious compliance fun stories. Sadly, Native American reservations are nothing but international border, so the situation is not so fun.

Add on top that the police have a history of being that kidnapper, and you have a huge problem of breaking silo walls. 

This is where it's important to consider if your goal is equitable outcomes or equal policies. We have a disproportionately large problem for NA people, mainly women. All missing persons and could be missing persons deserve attention, but we know one segment that is different, worse, than the others. Therefore, if we add more attention to that segment, we can have more equitable outcomes all around.

This is the same concept around BLM. All lives do matter, but by outcome, black lives are not receiving the same treatment as other segments. Therefore, to make all lives matter, we need to focus on raising black lives to the same standards as whites. This should actually be truly done segment population by segment, which analysis could prove to be more specific like from certain neighborhoods or certain age ranges, but ""market segmentation driven improvements for good"" is not as catchy.

"The same reasons there are special alerts for children or at risk elderly. They are people too, but do you question the need for a faster response if they go missing?

The need in all these cases boils down to the overall risk faced by the situation as well as resources that would normally be raised to find them being too little.  To clarify these groups are more likely to end up dead or lost forever, they are drastically less likely to be brought home under normal situations. Additionally the resources available, that are adequate for a normal missing person, dont quite fit. Such as needing to bring in the FBI or Forestry Police because the likelyhood of being taken across state lines or even out of country. Or said a different way, these groups are more vulnerable to juristiction problems, strangers or traffickers who are more difficult for local police to handle, if not outright impossible.

Like a racecar, school bus, seimi truck, and sedan are all cars but you probably know enough to understand the reasoning behind treating them differently on the road/licencing/etc.  There is a lot of complexity behind these groups of humans and the crimes they are statistically likely to be victims to that they deserve being acknowledged as different.

"It is a real issue.

As a primer I would reccomend watching Wind River on Nextflix. It's a really good fictional movie that helps illustrate the complexities of missing indigenous women.

That being said, yes, this seems to be entirely performative.

The roots of the issue run deep in the culture and, while it's good our state is acknowledging the problem, it's not likely this will make much or any difference.

"Please take this with all due respect. Not looking for an argument. I am just missing something.

The tribal reservation is a sovereign nation therefore the jurisdiction would be that of the Tribe right? There should not be any conflict between tribal, county, local and state law enforcement. It would be the same when I go to the mall on the Tulalip reservation. I would be subject to tribal law and law enforcement. No different than if I went to Canada.

Lack of resources. Is it that not enough indigenous people are joining or interested in serving?

 Don't know why or what to say of the distrust. Why does this exist? Intrinsic racism or are they actually treated differently because they are indigenous? Which would be racist in itself.

Reporting news of a missing loved one should be the same process as anyone else.

"RG6 is only good for about 150’ of quality signal from the nearest service point...

"> When a person goes missing on a reservation, there are often there are jurisdictional conflicts between tribal police and local and state law enforcement.

And many times, families of tribal members distrust non-Native law enforcement or don’t know where to report news of a missing loved one.

> An alert system will help mitigate some of those problems by allowing better communication and coordination between tribal and non-tribal law enforcement and creating a way for law enforcement to flag such cases for other agencies.

"These programs need to overcome two major factors holding back rural internet. First, internet providers are not required to provide service to everyone, unlike electricity and telephone service. So they only go where they are going to make a profit. Second, rural customers are too far apart resulting in a high cost per customer. 

CenturyLink already has copper wire phone lines to nearly everyone so they add DSL at 1.5 or 10 MB. They will never increase this because they already get paid full internet price for providing substandard service. There is no profit in improvement.

Comcast. Well, if they are not on your rural road now, they never will. Costs to much. Again, no profit.

The only hope for improved internet (or internet at all for some homes) is fixed wireless internet (cellular) or low earth orbit satellite (not Hughes Net).",t2_dtnmjx1v,tacoseverytime,0,1648843579.0,0,t1_i30y6pj,i30y6pj,True,Philo1927,t3_ttxk15,https://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/ttxk15/how_comcast_and_other_telecoms_scuttle_rural_wa/,How Comcast and other telecoms scuttle rural WA broadband efforts,/r/Washington/comments/ttxk15/how_comcast_and_other_telecoms_scuttle_rural_wa/i30y6pj/,9,r/Washington,0,9

"In theory, the objection process is meant to avoid funding projects that would replicate existing infrastructure or result in “overbuild,” said Sen. Lisa Wellman, D-Mercer Island, who sponsored the 2019 bill that created both the state Broadband Office and the objection process.  
“The process isn’t one of trying to pit people against or groups against each other,” Wellman said. “The process is trying to get broadband out to as many people as possible without overbuilding.”

"This has nothing to do with cruelty or people being evil. It is a philosophical issue.

Most honest republicans mean well. However, they believe the market should dictate costs, not the government. This works if you have say, 12-24 companies making insulin, the supply would be great enough that demand would not be great enough to drive up prices. Unfortunately, it is questionable if there is profit at those levels.

Most honest democrats mean well. However, they believe that the government should have a much more authoritarian hand in certain matters especially around general welfare. Philosophically, this is well meaning, caring and reasonable. Unfortunately (and anyone who studies history can attest to this), the more authority you give to a government, the less liberty you have.

Personally, I think this:

If any government funds were used in the creation of insulin, then at a minimum the recipe for insulin should be public domain.

"So don’t 100% quote me on this and please do your own research but here’s a general overview I’m confident is mostly correct:

M partner and i recently were in the market for a PIH or EV and here’s what i learned: There are certain laws that certain states have requiring companies to sell a particular kind of hybrid vehicle in order for the companies to get tax subsidies or govt money for their sale of hybrid/EV/PIH. So according to some dealerships and other research we did online, that’s why you have super small hybrids or EVs like the Leaf that are low volume EVs in California - the companies didn’t put them out super seriously but more as a means of saying “hey we’re doing this California/Oregon, give us our tax break.” This is also why a lot of PIHs only have range of like ~40 miles. They did it for the tax breaks. 

However, those vehicles have caught on quite a bit and are beginning to get more popular, plus more federal and state regulations are coming into place requiring higher MPG, more EVs, lower carbon footprint, etc

Washington was not one of those states till very recently, so that’s why there’s no inventory. 

Now for the opinion part: personally I go out hiking quite a bit and also wanted a hybrid or EV for road trips. I also love cars so don’t want a little 4 banger that goes 0-60 in 15 seconds. I found that an overwhelming amount of the hybrids or EVs were so much more expensive after all the options I wanted (better stereo, sunroof, AWD) and/or had significantly less power. We drove a Tesla Model 3 LR once and that was a wrap. At the time it was only about $6-$8k more than the Toyota, Honda and Suburu models we checked out and wow it’s been so worth it. I fucking hate Elon musk and all his fanboys but it’s a great vehicle and after test driving all the options, I’m beyond satisfied and excited to have something that will last a very long time. Obviously ymmv and they’re not for everyone but i did a ton of spreadsheet work and cost analysis, and when you add in maintenance costs, gas, etc, it ends up being very worth it in my opinion.",t2_jgmh6,thecreator3671,0,1648741904.0,0,t1_i2v0elg,i2v0elg,True,InTh3s3TryingTim3s,t3_trem9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Washington/comments/trem9o/plug_in_hybrid_cars_for_sale_question/,Plug in hybrid cars for sale question,/r/Washington/comments/trem9o/plug_in_hybrid_cars_for_sale_question/i2v0elg/,1,r/Washington,0,1

">so is there a time limit on applying for WA benefits?

Yes, this is called back dating. There is a general limit to how far back you can backdate an application, the immediate week is never a problem but anything beyond four weeks is very very difficult and you would need to show some kind of circumstance beyond your control.

Regarding this part

"This might be a bit ranty 

I've been obsessed with the Green River for my entire life but have really gone down the rabbit hole in the last three years. The experiences I've had and all that I have learned has literally changed my life and put me on a path I've always wanted but was to scared to take that ""first step"" if you will. I hope some day to be a geology teacher and tell grand stories of the area to all those that will listen. It was through my continued curiosity that lead me to apply for college, start working with the musuems in the area and gain valuable relationships that have helped me every step so far. It all goes back to the river at the end of the day. While I've taken friends and family to the area. Today is the first day I'm taking a group of complete strangers out there. Really the nerves come from wanting to make sure that I'm able to tell the stories, make it intresting and get what ever it is in my soul thats telling me to tell these stories. I guess it's time to see if all that work has paid off. As Christopher Titus once said, ""Step up or Step aside. You don't get to bitch unless you're willing to do something about it"". Suppose it's time for me to step up.

"Yeah, good suggestion to check drive times, and do it on multiple days. My son lived just east of Monroe for about six years and commuted to Bellevue. But the drive times can vary pretty wildly, just one accident and you can be stuck for a long time. He used some alternates at times (Monroe to Carnation via 203, then over Tolt Hill to 202), but at that point you're on two lane country roads and it isn't any faster than just sitting in traffic. It can get really complicated when the rivers flood and the roads close.

"Might be an unpopular opinion but I think it's best not to blow up specific locations on social media platforms. Some people might enjoy the reclusiveness of nature, it might be one of the main reasons for going out into nature, to get away from society. So when we make posts about specific location details, we run the risk of ruining the ""hidden gem"" aspect of a location. If this scene was crowded full of people and litter it would significantly take away from it's beauty. To OP: if you want to find this location, go drive around there.

">You cherry picked

If I cherry picked then so did you.

>whether this bill was going to be effective or not, then switched your argument to ""It won't stop gun violence"" which is not the purpose of the bill.

The purpose of this bill is clearly to virtue signal and also is a part of a series of steps to outright ban private ownership of firearms.

Its not going to stop gun violence nor is it going to increase survival rates of incidents of gun violence.

>This is about safety and statistically keeping more people alive when people misuse guns by minimizing access to things that cause the most harm.

If this was about safety then limiting access to high capacity magazines is the wrong way to go, it is not going to make an increase in safety but rather make responsible gun owners more vulnerable.

If the population want to be more safe then more of the population should consider arming themselves.

I'm not moving any goal posts.

Edit:

>Frankly, you're wrong. The numbers prove it because these laws are not new and have been in effect and actually does reduce lethality and there is no data to refute those claims.

Plenty of mass shootings continue in said states in which highi capacity magazines have been banned and no study has ever 'proven' they reduced lethality of said incidents.

Also individaul studies never ""prove"" anything they just can help support stances. Frankly you're the one in the wrong here.

>Fuck right off with your immaturity
