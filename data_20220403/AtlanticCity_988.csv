"It’s been years since I’ve gotten a slice from them. I was always underwhelmed whenever I got a slice from the case whether it was specialty or standard. That being said I still enjoyed the slices with the sweet corn and slices with the Mac and cheese. I’d have to say my favorite items are the Boken Boy sub, their Buffalo chicken sub, and a Korean chicken sub I think called Seoul Train. The cheesesteak ole is great too, it’s nothing like any standard cheesesteak so just be aware of that if you’ve got a hankering for a good regular one. Their specialty fries are great too.

If you’re in the mood for Mexican and pizza I would have to recommend Atlantic Pizza’s Oaxaquena pizza. It has jalapeños, black beans and chorizo and is so damn good. They have a couple other Mexican pizzas on the menu too.

Ive never had them but Rincon Catracho was voted best empanadas in the city in 2020, could be worth checking out.

For a fancy date night I really liked Knife and Fork. I did a fancy date night there with my husband last year. For the first half hour we had a whole floor to ourselves even though the bar and the lower floor was packed. We didn't ask for this, it just happened. Neat extra perk! It was close to sunset so the lighting was really wonderful. And then where we were seated I could actually see a sliver of the ocean without even moving my head through the whole meal, which was cool. 

And besides all that, the most important part -- the food blew my mind and is still the best food I ever ate. The duck confit appetizer was wild.

"Absolutely. There is a big problem among those who make money via paypal through another company or entity such as online gambling because stupid Paypal sends a 1099K AND then Daftkings (for example) will ALSO send you a 1099 if your winnings were over $600 in a given year. 

Even if you do NOT win over $600, Paypal will still not account for the amount you initially deposited for online gambling. They literally tax you on whatever Draftkings or Fanduel gives you (including the amount you bet).

"Don’t know your age but boogie is usually an older crowd. Look up the specific night to see if there is a theme night that you may or may not enjoy. It is a small place. On the other hand the Trop tends to attract the very young as well. 20 something bachelorette parties and rowdy frat guys.  Trop has other options including karaoke and sports bars but don’t know what’s still survived due to covid. 

“The Pool” at Harrah’s is nice with a hip vibe, pool in the center of the club, large place, it is indoors. Probably a $30 cover though. 

Also look up Borgata, Hard Rock and Ocean. Haven’t been to their club type nightlife but they all have something. Borgata is isolated (as is Harrahs) and you will need to drive if you want to go somewhere else. Ocean and Hard Rock are close to each other, quick walk on the boardwalk. A longer walk will take you to other casinos 

Casinos. All the ones I mentioned have solid gambling

Check to see what’s open before you go and stay in groups if on the boardwalk at night.

"Tennessee Ave Beer Hall and Wingcraft are probably the best for craft beer. The Biergarten on the boardwalk has a ton of German beers as well as craft and standard domestic beers, along with a bunch of lawn games. Of course there are tons of bars around the city inside and outside of the casinos.

If you’re in to live music there’s almost guaranteed to be something going on/someone playing whenever you’re here. Lots of great music coming this year! Check out Anchor Rock Club and Bourre for bands and music events outside of the casinos. 

Italian food I’ve always enjoyed Cafe 2825 and they’ve got some great table-side apps like fresh burrata and pasta in a cheese wheel. They’re a place you 100% need reservations. Full service bar but only 2 or 3 beer options if I remember correctly.

Not sure if it counts as active but there’s Westecunk axe throwing. They happen to share a building with Little Water Distillery and The Seed brewery. Never been to the distiller but I’ve had the liquor, it’s meh. Meanwhile the brewery is phenomenal if you’re a craft drinker.  There’s a laser tag place about 15 mins outside of AC in Egg Harbor Township, haven’t been but heard good things. Chartering a boat to go fishing for a half day could be an option, but those days are sometimes 4am starts depending on where and what you’ll be fishing.",t2_46aurdj3,banjozoo,0,1646271340.0,0,t1_hz4krce,hz4krce,True,thatdorkpaul,t3_t5f01p,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticcity/comments/t5f01p/bachelor_party_looking_for_must_doeatdrink_ideas/,Bachelor Party - Looking for must do/eat/drink ideas in AC,/r/atlanticcity/comments/t5f01p/bachelor_party_looking_for_must_doeatdrink_ideas/hz4krce/,6,r/atlanticcity,0,6

"I haven’t used Doordash in AC so I’m not sure what restaurants are actually on the app. It really boils down to what kind of food you want. 

I had some incredible tacos de lengua at Los Compadres this past summer, according to google they deliver. Would order from there or El Rincon Del Sabor for Mexican food. I’ll give El Patron’s chorizo sopes an honorable mention because they’re so damn good. 

Com Ga Nihn Kieu is my favorite Vietnamese food in the area, google says they deliver but I’ve only ever eaten in. 

Yardy for great Jamaican food and they’re on Doordash, their portions are huge. 

Could always go with Tony Boloney’s if you’re looking for interesting/unique sandwiches. For pizza I would go with Atlantic Pizza, Queen, or South Side. Queen pizza has some REAL good empanadas too. 

Setaara is an Afghan/French fusion restaurant that’s awesome but I don’t think they’re available on delivery services. Some of the Afghan food is heavy on cilantro, so if you’re unlucky enough to not like cilantro be warned. 

For standard Chinese fare I’ve always enjoyed Imperial Inn, especially their roast pork noodle soup. 

I’ve never had it myself but I’ve heard good things about Ahkii’s Soul Meals if you’re looking for soul food. I was going to recommend Kelsey & Kim’s Southern Cafe for soul food but I can’t even find their menu online. I’ve never been to their dinner restaurant on Pacific but the southern cafe on Melrose is excellent. 

If you want some standard bar fare I’d say Tennessee Ave Beerhall or Wingcraft.

We’re staying at the trop. Can’t really beat the amount of things to do at the Quarter all in one place. Believe it or not, Boogie Nights in Trop is a really good time. Great club. As far as traditional clubs, HQ2 in Ocean and Premier in Borgata are gonna be your top 2 options. The Pool in Harrahs is okay, but gets sketchy late at night. Personally I avoid it. If you’re trying to ball out do American Cut Steakhouse in Ocean then HQ2 or Old Homestead Steakhouse in Borgata then Premier. Borgata and Ocean are gonna be the cleanest casinos. If you’re looking for grungy and rowdy, go to the Mountain Bar in Bally’s. You’ll see all sorts of trashiness but it’s a lot of fun.

I think previous dude nailed which club thing, go to wherever the best DJ is. Pregame at Wild West with Beer Pong, Flip Cup and Bull Riding

I prefer a hotel on the Boardwalk so you can get anywhere easily. Tropicana, Caesars or even Ballys all work for that. Hard Rock is nice, Oceans is far away. You can use a Total rewards card to ride a free shuttle up to the other three casinos near the marina.

"Best hotels are Borgata and Ocean, in terms of the nicest properties all around. Best clubs, depends on what you’re looking for. Harrahs, borgata and oceans all have great clubs.

"It was the summer of 1997, I was 17 and my ""grungy"" hair style out weighed me by at least 5lbs. I started my first lifeguarding job that summer at the White Sands 9010 Margate, NJ. I didn't know what to expect, but it certainly wasn't what ensued. The condos were taken over that summer by strippers that worked in Philly and took the summer off. With them followed a group of guys that I can only guess were cool enough to hang out with strippers on a daily basis. The strippers brought the guys and the guys brought more girls. It was like a movie, day in and day out. I would see one beautiful girl after another. Honestly, the guys they attracted were guys I wanted to look like, every one looked like they belonged on the cover of a magazine. 

The pool was open 10-6p.m., when 6 o'clock rolled around I always had issues getting these hulking guys to leave and of course the women they were with sat by them and rolled their eyes every time I said the pool was closed. It was just something I dealt with, until...

July 4th, the pool was a sea of thongs and biceps with barb wire tattos. I could not step off my lifeguard chair without carefully tiptoeing over bare bums, it is an image that has never left my mind. 5:30pm and maybe a 4th of these folks left, it seemed like the party was not stopping by any means. I knew this was going to be an issue. 5:35, 5:40, 5:45, I really didn't know what I was going do. More than half of these people I have never seen before. At 5:50pm I said, ""10 minutes and the pool will be closed"" no one even looked up at me. 

At 5:55p.m. a car pulled up that looked familiar, it was my grandfather, Pop! I couldn't believe he was here to visit, of all the days no less. Pop and Nan were swinging by to invite me to dinner, they were headed to one of the casinos to celebrate the 4th. 

My grandfather was a self made man. He grew up poor, but didn't know it. He served our country, went to war, to college, and started funeral home business from scratch. He was a bit more than a barb wire tatto to say the least. 

5:55p.m. ""five minutes, and the pool will be closed' I said with slightly more authority in my grandfather presence. No one looked up, not even a groan. My Pop, I am sure in his 60s, grabbed the metal chain that was used to lock the pool gate. He stood at the deep end and rapped the chain acrossed the vinyl fence, which made this God awful sound. Everyone stopped, you could hear a pin drop. He said, ""Get the hell out of the pool, it is closed!""

I never saw Pop look like that. Every muscle in the pool was deflated. In a line, single file, every person left. I locked the doors at 5:59p.m. that night, the earliest I had ever locked them.

I went back to school that September and I was different. What my grandfather did I knew I could do. I was his grandson, we shared the same blood. I was never the same after that. I was Pop's grandson and the White Sands closed at 6p.m. on the dot from then on.",t2_j3ohl8jk,Internal-Car1337,0,1645023660.0,0,t1_hx6h1st,hx6h1st,False,TheBitterSeason,t3_sscty3,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticcity/comments/sscty3/a_morning_scene_on_the_atlantic_city_boardwalk_in/,A morning scene on the Atlantic City Boardwalk in 1978,/r/atlanticcity/comments/sscty3/a_morning_scene_on_the_atlantic_city_boardwalk_in/hx6h1st/,6,r/atlanticcity,0,6

"Ocean’s is my spot. Best ocean views, has a very decent sportsbook, and catered to younger crowd with Nola’s Lounge and HQ club. I suggest to book when a famous DJ is schedule to perform because the turnout would be even greater. There are plenty of nice places to eat depending on your culinary taste, and if not then take a short walk to HardRock where there’s even more choices. 

Covid is irrelevant. Some people wear masks, some don’t, but no on ever Karen-ed me about my choice.

"I take walks on the boardwalk with open bottles and never got harassed. Just don’t be drunk off your face and messing with other people and you’ll be left alone. You can smell weed everywhere during the warmer months. People will be chill as long as you don’t act out of control stupid. You’ll see homelessness and cops everywhere on bikes once you leave the casinos so I recommend a nice casino that has lost of amenities if you want to avoid that sight.

Each casino has it’s own vibe, some are fancier and cater to younger crowds like Hard Rock, Ocean’s, Borgota. Some are a classic go to spot that locals are loyal to like Tropicana, Caesar’s, and Golden Nugget. Some are known for certain games. My brother likes Borgota for poker, my other friends like Harare’s for the same game. 

When I went to Vegas I quickly learned that the best place to stay is on the strip where the action is. I recommend the same with AC and you should book a hotel on the boardwalk. There will always be a bar open somewhere in this town, trust me. The spots I personally had fun at are Ocean’s, Tropicana, Golden Nugget, and Harrahs. Some of my other friends like HardRock and Borgata. 

The vibe is generally cool. I met a few Texans here and they seem to love it. Even though we’re considered a blue state, we’re generally apolitical, I think. Californians are very welcomed too. And yeah, Westcoast beaches are better, but come August-September the waters are warmer. 

Overall I think you’ll enjoy the experience. I‘ve been there once a month since June because I get free rooms at Oceans which I think has the premiere views of all the hotels. I bring 1k for 3-day stays and I do fine with that as long as I pace myself. But whenever I win big which is currently the type of streak I’m on, I’m just straight balling out and living it up nicely. I actually was there last weekend and on my 2nd day won a shitload of cash.

"Was there last weekend for 3 days. I try to book every month. Usually in the spring and summer I take walks on the boardwalk to start my day or as a break from playing Craps. Last weekend was a winter storm that dumped 16 inches and I’m surprised I found things to do despite being snowed in.

I watched 3 basketball games at the sportsbook in Oceans where I stayed, was spacious and relaxing. I worked out a bit at the gym, open from 6am to 6pm. I played craps each day; 300 a day budget, or 2 hours max, or if i profit 500 dollars or more, which ever came first. On Friday there was a live band at Nola’s Lounge which I enjoyed very much and had 3 drinks there after winning some good craps money. Saturday i recouped from a hangover that I didn’t regret since Friday was very fun. Slept in my nice hotel all day and then ate my ass off when I regained my energy. Actually, I ate well the whole entire time. Many choices.

Hard to imagine but I felt my time was spent just right although it was winter and not much else to do. The key is to pace yourself. Workout, eat everywhere, watch sports, or take a dip at the pool. I was very refreshed when I came home. 

When you go in July it’ll be even better beacause the beach and other tourist attractions will be open. Search google for things to do in AC.

I also really enjoy the Irish Pub but it's bar food and I've been going since I was a kid so keep your expectations tempered. I'd still say it's a can't-miss for the atmosphere & interior.

"For first timers looking to get the experience I'd stay on the boardwalk as opposed to the Marina District.  If you aren't familiar the Marina district is Harrahs, Borgata, and Golden Nugget.  They are off on their own away from the ocean/boardwalk and you'd need to drive to go anywhere else.  Boardwalk has more casinos/bars and everything is walking distance if you want to.  

Ocean would be a nice place to stay, rooms generally have good views and it's an upscale property and they do have a night club called HQ2 (never been personally, not sure about covid status).

Hard Rock is pretty nice, has a lively casino floor, and a younger crowd / party ish vibe.  They have a Sugar Factory (trendy restaurant with crazy deserts) and Hard Rock Cafe - both of which I've enjoyed.

Caesars is nice, little bit more laid back of a vibe though.  I like the Gordon Ramsay pub there. The Wild West section of the casino can be a lot of fun on weekends, there's a bar in there, sometimes live music, and some retro jumbo arcade type games, big sportsbook, etc.

There's a Ruth's Chris around the corner from Caesars.

"Atlantic City is basically a tale of two cities... most of the city seems like it could use modernization/cleanup/more policing but where most people go, the casinos, the boardwalk, the beach, the outlets, the convention center, they're all in fantastic parts of the city.

The winter really isn't the most exciting time to be on/near the boardwalk.  Like others alluded to, the boardwalk shops are more than likely going to be closed until Memorial Day weekend or just before.  The boardwalk is going to be quiet; few people would want to stroll on the boardwalk when it's bitter cold.  It probably looks amazing after the past two snowstorms!

The boardwalk is a completely different story in the summer.  AC thrives as a whole on Fri-Sun and like all other shore towns and communities it can be fun trying to get to AC after the work day is over on Friday as well as on Saturday.  Same for leaving on Sunday.  There usually aren't as many people in AC during the week; the exception is usually one Tuesday and Wednesday in August for the [annual airshow](https://airshow.acchamber.com/) (this year it's being held on Wednesday August 24 with a dress rehearsal on August 23).

The casinos are all thriving year-round.  Each one has a different atmosphere and experience from bars, clubs, gambling, restaurants, shopping, shows, and other amenities.  Six of them are located along the boardwalk and three are in the marina area.  They all vary in price if you choose to stay overnight; Friday and Saturday nights are usually double or triple the weekday rates and during airshow week those rates are the same as the weekend.

I mentioned outlets... AC has the [Tangier Outlets](https://www.tangeroutlet.com/atlanticcity).  All the locations are located off of the boardwalk by a few blocks but in a very nice and safe area.

Is AC expensive?  Yes, but if you do your homework you can eat and stay for a reasonable cost.  For instance, [Borgata](https://www.theborgata.com) has several restaurants on the casino floor and for two people you could easily spend $50-75 or upwards of $120 or more, not including alcohol.  However, there is a food court downstairs where you could spend $30-40 for two people but remember it isn't upscale dining.  Most casino bars will charge a bit more for drinks; I tend to believe this is to offset the cost of a drink while you're sitting in front of a slot machine either donating to the casino master fund or winning.

There's also quite a number of great restaurants in AC that aren't in the casinos or near the boardwalk.  I can't vouch for any of them; I'm usually only in AC two or three times a year.  For adults, it has something for everyone.",t2_ccketm11,new_tanker,0,1643664875.0,0,t1_hv1qtus,hv1qtus,True,[deleted],t3_sc2r80,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticcity/comments/sc2r80/whats_the_lifestyle_like_in_atlantic_city/,What’s the lifestyle like in Atlantic City?,/r/atlanticcity/comments/sc2r80/whats_the_lifestyle_like_in_atlantic_city/hv1qtus/,2,r/atlanticcity,0,2
"[Borgata](http://www.theborgata.com) might be worth looking into for just about everything.  Since you're stating ""this weekend"" don't be surprised if you want to stay overnight if rooms aren't available or if there are rooms available, you're going to be paying a hefty premium (getting a room in AC on any weekend in any of the casinos is going to cost a ton).

"Nah, the pandemic didn't kill it... but I'd say it's best to wait a bit to come if you aren't local. Showboat (a former casino that was host to the House of Blues) is no longer a casino, which was stipulated in the terms of its sale by Caesars - they wanted to make sure it wasn't going to be competition for them - so now it is an indoor arcade and they're constructing the world's largest indoor water park. The Steel Pier is still around, as is the Pier Shops mall, Tanger Outlets, an Imax movie theater at the Tropicana, etc.

There's lots of good stuff in AC, if you look for it. The gambling is what it is, Las Vegas on a smaller scale. The newer casinos (Borgata, Ocean and Hard Rock) are able to emulate Las Vegas in terms of having a nice aesthetic, but the other casinos are pretty dated looking from the outside and in many cases underwhelming inside.

I used to be a regular at Harrahs, but nowadays I pretty much exclusively go to Borgata or Hard Rock. If you're looking for an experience inside casinos, those two (and perhaps Tropicana) won't let you down.

If you do wind up going to Trop, they're the same company as Caesars and Harrahs and they have a free shuttle that transports people around their three properties across the city. Every other casino in AC is stand-alone, in that they don't have sister-properties in the area. Bally's was part of Caesars until a few years ago, but, like Showboat, they were forced to sell it when they merged with Tropicana to avoid a monopoly.",t2_x8936,UnlimitedMetroCard,0,1642874468.0,0,t1_htrpugm,htrpugm,True,cheesemanfaye,t3_sa7vfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticcity/comments/sa7vfh/is_ac_worth_a_visit/,Is AC worth a visit?,/r/atlanticcity/comments/sa7vfh/is_ac_worth_a_visit/htrpugm/,15,r/atlanticcity,0,15

"I’m familiar with Ventnor Heights, there is a 3 bed/3 bath unit for sale for $259k, it does not list the square feet of the unit.  But that has to be the lowest price per square foot in Ventnor.  You are one mile to the beach, some folks ride their bike or just pack up the car and park within a couple streets of Dorset.  Yes, on summer weekends, everyone has the same idea, so the traffic getting across the Dorset Ave. bridge can get backed up, and sometimes there is a bridge opening that slows things down.  In summer months, the bridge will open on 15 minute intervals, but only if there is a boat present.  

As for flooding, this is present in many shore communities, just check out Sea Isle, Strathmere, Ocean City. Last September, we went to Ocean City and we could not go down several streets due to flooding in our SUV.   If this townhouse were in Margate, it would be 3x more valuable; but it’s not.  

It looks like the unit was built in 1972, so it’s 50 years old. Across the street is Crown Key Condos, these have boat slips, but I’m not sure if there are any for sale.   There is a 4 bed unit going for $975k., good luck to that owner, I think it’s a little rich.  There have been some 3 bed units recently sold in the $650k range.  

As with any condo, you need to find out from the Homeowners Association if there are any planned “special assessments” that will require an additional fee besides your regular monthly fee.  These occur due to unplanned maintenance or a capital repair.  You want to find out how much they have in reserve.  You don’t mention if this will be a second home or if it will be a primary residence.  I think most owners here are year round owners.

"I mean, it depends on how close to the Dorset Ave Bridge you are.  Much further than Calvert ave, you're probably gonna want to bike it.

There really are no ""bad"" parts of the Heights.  I'd say the condos back by the bay are the least desirable,  but it's not ""bad"" or ""dangerous"".

If you're thinking of buying a house, you **really** need to do your homework when it comes to the flood map.  On top of that, you'll want to visit for yourself when it rains heavy...especially during a high tide.  If your house isn't raised, you're looking at higher flood insurance.

You'll have to leave the island to do anything other than basic shopping.  The Acme in the Heights is *okay* but not really all that great.  There's a nicer, smaller supermarket in Margate called Cassel's but it's *very* expensive.  The only hardware store is Colmar over in Margate...again, more expensive than off the island.

Aside from that...just be ready for hellacious traffic in the summer.  When the bridge goes up, it's common the have traffic backed up almost to Wellington Ave.

Now for the good stuff.....Ventnor is a really nice town.  Plenty of good restaurants, diners, etc;  They just opened a new movie theater with a restaurant & a bar inside.  I haven't seen a movie there yet, but I've been inside and it's beautiful.

You don't get as much of the ""party town"" crowd as other beach towns.  Ventnor is more family oriented.

I lived in Ventnor for 8 years...though not in the Heights, I was on the other side of the bridge.  I really enjoyed living there, and the only reason I left was because the houses were out of my price range on a single income.

It’s probably the best Remaining value in a beach town in Atlantic County. Flooding is an issue but ur paying flood insurance no matter where you buy on barrier islands.

"All of the Heights (and 90% of the rest of Absecon Island) flooded during Sandy.  There are accurate FEMA flood maps available showing exactly where the water went.

If you're sensitive to being periodically threatened by flood waters and occasionally being flooded, I wouldn't buy there.  It will only be getting worse.

On the other hand, if your house is lifted and you can tolerate the inconvenience of being isolated when the waters rise, then the prices in the Heights are the most affordable in Ventnor.

"Ventnor Heights is fine. You won't find million dollar places but it's a solidly safe and middle class area. If you lived in the back of the heights it might be a 20-25 minute walk to the beach, worst case.

Cons? There's nothing to do in the winter. Super quiet. The Wawa got shut down a few years ago. Traffic gets shitty in the summer. Many properties were wrecked with Sandy .

Whatever you do, you should work with a good realtor who has experience with the buildings you have interest.

Look up Atlantic City Crust Kings on YouTube or Instagram. An ok buddy of mine Eric ran it for a while. It’s a more in depth look of what really goes on in the city day to day night to night. There’s actually a good documentary they made. Worth the watch.

For what it’s worth this is going to be mainly negative yet real of what it’s like just walking down pac ave even in the mid day. It’s not the worst city in the world but the documentary is fair.

If you end up in the city I wish you luck. Most crime is property unless you’re looking for trouble. A lot of drunken tourist, gangs, just stuff like that goes on that shouldn’t concern you so it won’t be an issue. Burglary isn’t uncommon either unfortunately.

"1.)  $13 an hour is pretty low.  At 45 hours a week, that's $585 *before* taxes.  Which is likely to be around $468 after taxes.  Take out $110 for housing...that leaves you with $358 a week to live on if you work 45 hours every week.


2.) ""Safe"" is a relative term.  Parts of Atlantic City are perfectly safe as anyplace else, but there are parts that are not very safe.  There is a fair amount of drugs and street crime in those places.

3.) There's work, but it's most likely lower paying jobs in retail and the service industry.

"101 Boardwalk has a lot of section 8 housing. It's real tricky displacing people who get Section 8 housing against their will. If someone wanted to buy and knockdown 101 boardwalk, they would likely have to first build new housing to replace it, then you'd have to get people to move willingly(and honestly, the views from that place are amazing so why would you want to move out of your free/reduced cost apartment with ocean views?). So immediately the cost of that land and building would double because you'd need to buy another piece of land and build an equal or better place. Then you have to get residents to move, and maybe some don't want to, then you have to go to court to force them to which you may or may not win and will be lengthy. It happened previously when someone bought Fox Manor in the city and tried to rehab it, the ACLU got involved, it got tied up in court, and the building had to be actually condemned before they got them out, it wound up being so long and costly that even though the sale went through and the people moved out, the building has sat for a few years because of the costs before they even started work. And Fox Manor was just a hotel that people lived in and was one of the worst places in the city for drugs and such, 101 Boardwalk is nowhere near as bad. So yeah, basically, it's a nice piece of land but it's hard to legally justify evicting people just because a private company has the opportunity to make money.",t2_ab8n2,Iamdickburns,0,1639584374.0,0,t1_honpg5e,honpg5e,False,spliezer,t3_rh0yns,https://www.reddit.com/r/atlanticcity/comments/rh0yns/can_someone_explain_these_houses_on_this_land_are/,Can someone explain these houses on this land?

"Source am Firefighter and have lived in the city for a long time now. So that whole area is the Inlet, many years ago all those lots were houses and small stores. Some of the land is now owned by Ocean Casino, the area at the bottom of the picture that butts against the casino is a large track of land that the casino holds in case it ever wants to build a second tower. That area has been deemed a redevelopment area by the CRDA, so the CRDA has purchased and holds a bunch of those lots. They ran into an issue because they were trying to use Eminent Domain to kick out the last hangers on. They lost in court because you can't kick people out of their house just because you want to buy their land and sell it at a profit for a private corporation. There has also been some deed restriction issues because the city restricted building small hotels with less than 300 rooms so people that have shown interest in smaller projects are not getting permission. The CRDA (Casino Reinvestment Development Authority) is a mixed blessing, they are given large amounts of tax money to help manage and develop the tourism district but they wind up buying and sitting on so many pieces of property it actually stifles investment at times if you aren't connected politically to get them to release land or give permission for projects.

"“We want to increase transparency, and also citizen compliance, satisfaction and trust in the police,” said Stockton Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice Nusret Sahin, who is the lead investigator on the EPJETS project (Enhancing Procedural-Justness of Encounters Through Substantiation).  
  
Starting this summer, and over the next 18 months, some 2,000 traffic stops in Atlantic City and Pleasantville will be monitored as part of the study.  Those stopped will be given information about traffic stops. The findings will be used to improve police-community relations.  
  
At a press conference Monday announcing the project, police chiefs said they support the project and its goals.  
  
James Sarkos, interim officer in charge, Atlantic City Police Department said the entire department is involved with the procedural justice training offered through Stockton and the new research takes that training to the next level.  
  
“I have seen first-hand the benefits,” Sarkos said. “This project will scientifically validate how we can improve police-community relations.”  
  
Pleasantville Police Chief Sean Riggin said the project gives his smaller department the opportunity to partner on a major initiative.  
  
“I am struck by the caliber of people on this project,” he said. “This will be transformative.”  
  
Stockton is partnering with faculty at Rutgers and Northwestern University on the initiative.

"The temps are “warm” for this time of year, I was able to walk out in shorts and a hoody today. When the sun goes down is when it gets considerably colder. The boardwalk at night in the winter is like a empty street at night in winter. No boogey men out there trying to get you lol. It’s well lit in the casino strip but going into Ventnor the boardwalk lights start to get scarce but it is still lit all the way down to the end of Ventnor. The jitney is the best way to get around if the casino shuttles aren’t running, the fare is 2.25 a person. Very bumpy ride so hold on to your seat! When the real winter hits it’s mostly slush on the streets but most business clear off their side of the street and put salt down.
