"when i was a kid i was in JAWS (not sure if that’s still a thing) and then from that i could have gone into SAIL. they had me go to like an event at Wainwright to like see the program and meet the kids that were in it etc. this like like 2005ish when i was in 3rd grade. and i just hated it so much. i thought my peers were annoying and precocious. the teachers were preachy and like talked to us in a weird way. like simultaneously talking down to us like babies but with this weird undertone that we’re somehow superior to other kids. i told my parents i really didn’t want to go there and they let me stay in the JAWS program at the school i was already at. 

the most important thing should be getting as much info and experience with the program as possible before making the decision. i’m sure that tons and tons of other people think very differently about SAIL than i did at that time but i just wanted to put my perception out there. i may have been testing super high and all that stuff but the people in that program were absolutely not my kind of people.",t2_hxl49ke,Dawashingtonian,0,1649013737.0,0,t1_i39byck,i39byck,True,39220DPW,t3_tuqirz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tuqirz/info_on_sail_program/,Info on SAIL Program?,/r/Tacoma/comments/tuqirz/info_on_sail_program/i39byck/,1,r/Tacoma,0,1

"You're biggest issue will be once in you're in Pierce County, especially now. PT is extremely short handed on bus drivers and isn't running anywhere near ""full service"". PT ends services on most runs fairly early, believe the RT1 is the last PT route out, which ends at like 1130pm? Something like that. Afternoon wise, won't be an issue. Metro bus to Auburn Train station, catch the ST 578 to Puyallup, then a PT 400 into Tacoma from there. Orca card will work on all 3 transit services.

You might want to look into what options you have for evenings. I know the ST 574 runs pretty late. You may be able to catch that from Tacoma Dome Station and do a transfer at Federal Way into Auburn or something from Sea-Tac into Auburn, dunno what Metro's services hours are like or how bad their driver shortages are, something to look into.

Metro has the best service in the area because they have the funding. PT could do a lot better if voters would allow them to increase their tax collection or restructure their funding completely in a similar fashion that Metro is, but Pierce County is historically anti transit for some reason.",t2_fecma,fubar_86,0,1648960300.0,0,t1_i36qgkw,i36qgkw,True,Aesho,t3_tuem4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tuem4c/public_transportation_options_from_auburn/,Public transportation options from Auburn?,/r/Tacoma/comments/tuem4c/public_transportation_options_from_auburn/i36qgkw/,1,r/Tacoma,0,1

"Get a couple more ring cameras if that's the only one. If you aren't already armed, it would be a good idea to get some protection (and learn how to use it properly and safely!). Crime is up like crazy, and more people should consider getting a Concealed Pistol License to protect themselves when they aren't in their homes.

I hate that the first idea in my head is to arm yourselves, but people like this are obviously looking for trouble. Another lesson learned is not to go up to cars like that when people are exchanging words in a threatening matter. 

A threat to your life shouldn't be taken lightly, and to clarify my earlier point, I'm not saying you should brandish a firearm or shoot at that person in the car, but if they escalate you just want to be able to protect yourself. A good can of pepper spray and a bright flashlight at night also goes a long way.

"Hi, kid who works in the industry and uses public transportation in tacoma here. Can confirm that with how late we get out, busses will often stop running. The 594 from tacoma to Seattle runs very late into the night though. Your best bet might be to find a place that’s open for lunch (or earlier in the day) so you get an earlier shift and be done earlier in the day while the busses are still running? You could also maybe do bar prep? I have one bar prep shift a week and it’s from 9am-2pm. Could be a good step in the door until you figure out a more permanent solution. You might be able to find a gig somewhere that will allow you to be off first, but it’ll be tough. Also, agreed with getting an Orca card, it’s a life saver. Just remember that when you reload the card it takes AT LEAST 24 hours for the balance to appear on the card. The app that I like to use for public transportation is called Transit and it’ll plan out trips for you depending on what’s still running. It lays out all of the public transportation options nearby. I’ve done trips up to Seattle with stops in Sea-Tac/White Center/South Seattle and used the app to guide me the entire way.

"That may be a difficult to impossible commute that late at night/early in the morning

You’ll need an Orca card because you may be transferring from King County Metro to Sound Transit to Pierce Transit.

You will tap your Orca card when getting on the bus. Tap getting on and off the train. It will charge your Orca account and take care of the interagency fare transfers 

We have 3 separate transit agencies in this area. For the commute that you describe you may need to use all 3. 

Check out their routes and schedules to see if they go where and when you need to go.

"For houseplants, my top picks are Fernseed and Jade & Co. Both are great little shops with a lovely selection of gorgeous houseplants. Fernseed also has lots of beautiful pots, planting supplies, and some locally sourced gift items. Jade & Co has a TON of plants for how little the shop is. Both are staffed with friendly and helpful folks! I'm seeing comments about markup, and I understand for folks on a budget, but just know you're supporting local, women-owned shops.

Portland Ave Nursery is HUGE and beautiful and has so many options, outdoor & indoor. Same goes for Watson's in Puyallup, not too far outside of Tacoma.

Gardensphere is another great Tacoma shop. I like to get my Christmas tree there every year but they also have a great selection of indoor and outdoor plants.

"From article:

Roughly 40 years ago, Charles Weatherby came back to Tacoma.

It was 1981, and Weatherby — a military kid who graduated from Lincoln High School and later attended the University of Washington School of Medicine — had spent the previous three years in Milwaukee, completing a residency 2,000 miles from home.

Weatherby was a doctor now and began his career in family medicine at a clinic in the Salishan neighborhood, not far from where he’d grown up on the Eastside.

Even decades after the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ‘60s, he was one of the few Black doctors in Tacoma’s history, following in the footsteps of the well-known Dr. Daniel Thomas, recalled Willie Stewart. Stewart came to know Weatherby years earlier when the civic leader and barrier-breaking Black educator was an assistant principal at Lincoln.

“I think he felt a need for this community. He grew up in this community,” Stewart said of Weatherby’s decision to return.

On Thursday, Weatherby, 70, retired — walking out of his family practice office on South 19th Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd one last time.

It was the culmination of a career spent caring for the community he grew up in, while serving as a trailblazer and inspiration for those who followed.

“It’s important to me that I made a difference in someone’s life,” Weatherby told The News Tribune this week, reflecting on his motivation over the last 41 years.",t2_eq0dj,thenewstribune,0,1648828327.0,0,t1_i2zw71e,i2zw71e,True,thenewstribune,t3_tttywq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tttywq/a_pioneering_black_doctor_retires_after_40_years/,A pioneering Black doctor retires after 40 years in Tacoma.

"Love jade and co but they are typically pretty pricey on some of the 'rarer' plants (I say pricey compared to ordering on etsy).. they are similar in price as fernseend but I'd say jade and co has a superior plant selection. Fernseed for all my fancy, special pots (looking at you Bergs) 👀

Imo, definitely check out Sunny's! They're located on antique row directly across from the McMenamins. They're a bit newer. They have LOTS of amazing Cacti (big specimens) and it's kind of they're specialty. But, they also have a great selection of tropicals! It's amazing how much they have in such a small space and they always have fair prices!

The Washington State Committee on Geographic Names is soliciting public input to rename 18 places in the state that currently contain the word “sq\_\_\_” — an ethnic and sexual slur for Indigenous women — in their names. 

The name change includes Sq\_\_\_ Lake in Pierce County, one of several small lakes accessible via the Wonderland Trail in the southwest portion of Mount Rainier National Park. 

The change is in response to the U.S. Department of the Interior’s February proposal to remove the word, which was officially declared a derogatory term as a result of Secretary’s Order 3404, from Federal Lands. The Department announced a list of candidate replacement names for more than 660 geographic features with the word, initiated Tribal consultations and an opportunity for public comment to recommend and review proposed replacement names by April 25.",t2_eq0dj,thenewstribune,0,1648758843.0,0,t1_i2w8ms4,i2w8ms4,True,thenewstribune,t3_tt8ziv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tt8ziv/these_18_geographic_features_in_wa_include_a/,These 18 geographic features in WA include a derogatory word and now face a name change,/r/Tacoma/comments/tt8ziv/these_18_geographic_features_in_wa_include_a/i2w8ms4/,12,r/Tacoma,0,12

"It's already illegal to cut off a catalytic converter. It's already illegal to sell stolen goods. It's illegal for scrap yards to buy stolen goods. It's illegal for them to buy catalytic converters without a vin and an ID from the person selling it. 

So tell me, what is this performative waste of time going to do to solve the problem?

The idea of ""criminalizing"" these kinds of transactions instead of dealing with the cause of the problem in the first place is extremely reductive. The inability of the government to use their existing regulatory ability to shut down the places that are known for this kind of shit is the ultimate problem.

So no, I don't think passing a law is a good strategy. I think we need to deal with it like we do at the LCB. Hire state agents to attempt to traffic stolen goods to shops and, when they accept them, shut them down (going a step further: seize their assets, and convert the facility to a state operated recycling facility which can do a better, cleaner, safer job recycling the infinite meta waste our state creates).",t2_aj8on,glynnjamin,0,1648755288.0,0,t1_i2vzelp,i2vzelp,False,blessedarethegeek,t3_tt39ek,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tt39ek/wa_governor_signs_bill_to_deter_catalytic/,WA governor signs bill to deter catalytic converter theft,/r/Tacoma/comments/tt39ek/wa_governor_signs_bill_to_deter_catalytic/i2vzelp/,20,r/Tacoma,0,20

"Last week I walked the dogs (leashed) in the neighborhood just to the northeast of Sherman ES. A couple also on a walk had their THREE dogs off-leash, two of them pissed in two different homes’ planters. These folks are in every neighborhood. 

If a dog attacks you unprovoked and there are injuries, the owner is strictly liable for those injuries. Even if there is no contact, e.g. the dog lunges at you and you fall and break your leg, the owner is on the hook for it. A claim on a homeowner’s policy (the attack doesn’t have to take place on the property) may result in a hefty premium hike for the dog owner. 

There are tales here of dogs mauled by off-leash dogs. If you witnessed your dog or cat mauled by one of these animals, there may be damages beyond vet bills. Some attorneys will take smaller attack cases because a) they love dogs and b) they don’t have to screw around with liability. 

If they take your case, and you know who the dog owner is or where the dog resides, they will send a letter to the owner asking for insurance information. If they get that info, the attorney will put a claim in with the insurer, who now knows there is an animal on the property that may result in future claims, which may trigger a premium hike or cancelling the coverage. In the latter instance, whoever owns the paper on the house will get coverage, likely more expensive. 

If the owner doesn’t play ball and turn over their insurance info, the attorney will sue. If the dog owner turns the suit over to their carrier, the insurer is aware of the dog. If the dog owner doesn’t respond, they are at risk of having judgment entered against them by default and are exposed to collections actions and other misery. Good luck getting a loan with a judgment on your credit history. 

In short, the civil forum may be more likely to get results with shitty dog owners than the police or animal control.

Then, the city came in and finally started breaking the hold these slumlords had as they started to die off and more and more white people started moving next door to these properties.

"Since there are people that don't know how these needle exchange programs (NEP) help, here is a list [ACLU.org](https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/needle-exchange-programs-promote-public-safety) compiled. I would say they also help with hepatitis transmission as well but the focus for most studies were for HIV.   


From the website, with its citations listed at the link above if you want to explore the data in more detail. 

>**Needle Exchange Programs Promote Public Safety:**  
  
>  
>In 2002, NEPs reported removing nearly 25 million used syringes from communities. 13  
   
>  
>According to the Centers for Disease Control, the one-time use of sterile syringes remains the most effective way to limit HIV transmission associated with injection drug use. 14  
   
>  
>A study by the National Institutes of Health found that NEPs “show a reduction in risk behaviors as high as 80 percent in injecting drug users…” 15  
   
>  
>NEP participants have been found five times more likely to enter drug treatment than those who had never used an exchange. 16  
   
>  
>NEPs throughout the country have reduced HIV transmission rates by one-third to two-fifths. 17  
   
>  
>An analyses of a New York State-approved NEP found that during a 12-month period, an estimated 87 HIV infections were averted as a direct result of the use of needle exchange. 18  
   
>  
>Injection drug users who are afraid of being arrested while carrying drug paraphernalia are 1.74 times more likely to share syringes, and 2.08 times more likely to share injection supplies than other users. 19

There is also an associated cost reduction to public health systems: 

>It costs an average city about $160,000 to run an NEP (about $20 per user per year), whereas one syringe-infected AIDS patient will require upwards of $120,000 per year in public health expenditures. 11

Preventing 2 AIDS infections more than pays for the program in the long run. It's just more cost effective to deal with it this way. Plus, I believe there was a Last Week tonight show episode about this recently: [https://youtu.be/RMpCGD7b\_H4](https://youtu.be/RMpCGD7b_H4)

John Oliver highlighted the other effect of this. It reduces overdose deaths, and these places often help people get off of drug use.

"This might be my biggest problem with this city.   

A few years ago I was walking my black lab on a leash through a park and an unleashed dog zeroed in on her and came running.  He latched onto her neck and started thrashing.  I punched and kicked the attacking dog until it let go, but there was already an 8 inch gash in my dog's neck.  Thanks to the emergency vet she survived but not without permanent damage and passed a couple years later because of it.    

I still walk through that same park sometimes, and every time I do there are unleashed dogs.   

My new dog is small enough that I can pick him up when we get charged by another dog.  The owners often say the same thing, ""It's okay, he's friendly!""  
I reply, ""Oh good, that's what the last guy said just before his dog killed mine!""

"Literally had someone today let their German Shepherd run around off the leash and it was not trained to recall… I would not have been as pissed but he was obviously trying to push his dog to socialize with ours and we have very large but skittish dogs that don’t like to socialize while leashed.  He was following behind us trying to get close so we warned him that our dogs were not the types to be friendly towards unfamiliar dogs and to keep his distance and he did for a moment.. walk past a kids park with a sign that clearly says no dogs in the park and he has his dog off the leash and his dog books it across as he just watches like everything will be alright.   His dog started a fight with my very large Malamute-Wolf Hybrid and almost got it’s throat ripped out. Luckily my dog listens when told to back off but the owner was upset with me as if there was something I could do to control HIS, obviously, poorly trained German Shepherd.   Moments later his bald girlfriend thinks it’s a good idea to yell at me as well and tried to provoke my little sister into a fight and I still don’t understand how I could have handled that situation any better. I’m not going to yank my dog back from another attacking dog and restrict his ability to defend his self from an out of control dog.

"From the article:

""Aurora alert! Northern lights will be possible Wednesday night into Thursday morning as a strong geomagnetic storm unfolds with the arrival of a ""cannibal"" coronal mass ejection (CME) on Earth.

Two large, consecutive bursts of plasma ejected off the sun's corona on Monday with the second, slightly faster CME, overtaking the first, hence the cannibal nomenclature.

Of course, a completely clear sky over Western Washington has been a tough feat lately. While rain clouds could linger over Central Sound tonight, most areas will see at least partial clearing. So be on alert for aurora anytime after nightfall. 

Find a dark place, away from city light pollution, to increase your odds of seeing the faint green glow along the northern horizon.

If chasing auroras in the mountains, you'll be driving in a slushy 4""-6"" of new snow at Stevens and Snoqualmie Pass through tonight.

While impacts to technology from this geomagnetic storm may be low, forecast aurora activity will be high across the northern United States. The northern lights could be spotted as far south as Portland, OR, Cheyenne, WY, Chicago, IL, and New York City.""",t2_wuol5,nakedwithoutmyhoodie,0,1648697168.0,0,t1_i2sygot,i2sygot,True,nakedwithoutmyhoodie,t3_tsql3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tacoma/comments/tsql3o/northern_lights_sighting_possible_across/,Northern lights sighting possible across Washington overnight Wednesday,/r/Tacoma/comments/tsql3o/northern_lights_sighting_possible_across/i2sygot/,1,r/Tacoma,0,1
