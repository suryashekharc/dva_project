"> This just seems like you are vaugely trying to say

If you don't understand how economics works. 

You increase population without real economic growth, therefore wages go down as an increase in labor doesn't match flatline demand for growth. 

In addition we rely on foreign money to create a real estate bubble, which makes it even harder for people to find work and actually be productive in the major cities. Which makes wages even lower as money is being funneled into real estate instead of industry/manufacturing.

You're floating around some idea that it's better for 400,000 immigrants to come to Canada and find nothing but shit work/excessively expensive housing, than it is for 300,000 immigrants to come and have a decent living standard. 

Immigrants are increasingly feeling like they are getting ripped off by coming here. They're the people who feel the problems caused by oversupply of people most. It doesn't take a high level of empathy realizing they actually get screwed hardest by overpriced housing and low wages. They didn't come her to grovel at your feet because you're a white man. They came because they want a life that is actually better than back home. They statistically are more educated than Canadians, they statistically are relatively well off in their home countries, they come for something better and we have nothing to offer them. 

Add to all that we use a growing population to justify more government money being spent, so those immigrants come to Canada trapped in more debt/more taxes. 

Rich white folk bought there homes when they were still affordable, not regular immigrant today is ever gonna be able to afford a home as long as they live in this county, unless something changes.",t2_9459itjf,ApolloVangaurd,0,1648992872.0,0,t1_i37zg1d,i37zg1d,False,Rleduc129,t3_tul8ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manitoba/comments/tul8ee/the_rich_run_the_government/,The rich run the government,/r/Manitoba/comments/tul8ee/the_rich_run_the_government/i37zg1d/,1,r/Manitoba,0,1
"We get distracted by PC and Liberal back and forth as though our leaders don't just seem to still represent the interests of the same cheque books off the record anyways. Seems like you're not allowed to even dislike Justin without being labeled a conservative, or dislike whoever the conservative leadership is without being told you love Justin, etc.

I kind of hate both of our federal representatives and the fact no one else ever wins, which I think is the only thing that really could bring about realistic reform in our country, a liveable wage in the future, etc. Justin is actually a good example I think of someone out of touch with canada for the simple reason they grew up in the clothe around access to things (money, political opportunities) that regular people just fundamentally do not have access too. I'd wonder if the dynamic of the Ford family (if the other brother were still alive) isn't similar, like, it's not will and talent that get these people into politics, it's nepotism and money, someone knows someone, or your brother or parent already did this thing and makes it easier for you to do this thing. 

I'm frustrated with people who cry out that Justin is a dictator because they've clearly lived laughably entitled lives if this is what they consider dictatorial. At the same time I'd argue access and following through with those opportunities, like someone like Justin had, is at the very least oligarch-adjacent and likely a process like this has been going on for a long time. Now hints of private-payer health care are floating at least in places like Sask and Ontario and it's hard to wonder if it isn't being influenced by money, the people who have access to money, and American interests as well. Strikes me as a solely destructive policy that people won't be able to afford and almost feels like deliberate sabotage on the parts of premiers who are letting systems fail because they stand to benefit in some way or another. 

Feel like American politic-style attitudes in general have really saturated Canada in the last decade and *really* saturated our landscape in the covid years. Q'ers and the likes miss the point that their boot licking literally just advances the destruction of the social policies that make Canada's democracy special, I feel, like public healthcare. They do nothing to advance issues we will face in the decade and coming decades like responding to climate crisis, liveable cities, affordable homes, jobs that actually pay living wages, etc. It just all adds to the same stagnation while we bear the brunt of those realities, and people or businesses that already own shares in the market just scoop up larger portions from under us. 

A boomer told me the other week when we watched some guys dig through the dumpsters at work that 'they're (the First Nations) are the richest people on the planet and completely squander it,' rich being his perception that as a native literally everything is apparently covered in his eyes by the government. I tried to argue if those policies etc actually worked and weren't fundamental failures, the lives of many First Nations wouldn't look like they do across lots of Canada. And that arguably the actual richest people in Canada are the boomer generation for the simple reason that they actually had access to the golden bubble of opportunity, growth, money, etc that generations now just fundamentally will not have the same access too. 

And like, even the reserve I was up on last week was very nice but you can see clearly there just aren't enough services in general for the communities, but I bet politicians love the attitude of their boomer voter base being 'look how much of MY money goes to taxes/them and THIS is how they live??' because it lifts accountability by the politician to have to add more funds to those services, instead presenting it as exactly like the boomer feels, 'we give so much and they squander it' when the reality really is not enough is done in the first place, a politician just doesn't want it to be their responsibility and the State itself benefits from communities that remain too disorganized/struggling with local issues to vouch for themselves on a provincial or federal scale in terms of access to clean water, education, etc.

"The biggest fallacy is the illusion of agency within politics. This version of democracy is a sham. Evidently, colonial and capitalist ways of being socialized through the Western development project fail the majority while those on top thrive. It's a reverse robinhood storyline that is indoctrinated into our cultural understanding. 

Lisa Betasomasake Simspon is an amazing artist/writer/activist. She coined the term generative refusal. She essentially defines this concept as the resistance to colonial/capitalistic systems through actualizing alternative ways of being/knowing in collaboration with coalitions/cross-movement (aka people power). 

I think it is clear that the social processes of the 'government' are inadequate, to say the least. It is well past due time to start serious discourse on potential alternatives.

"Winnipeg suggestions:

Attractions: human rights museum, the forks, the legislative building, the zoo, red river ex (if you happen to be coming by in June), the center of Canada sign

Shopping: the outlet mall, polo park, at vital shopping centre, Ikea (nothing really special about shopping here but these are the better malls to go to). 

Food: Salisbury house, junior's, Prairie 360 (check their instagram before going as they still may not be open yet), Skinner's (its in Lockport with two locations but the one closer to the water is the cuter one), half moon (also in Lockport), feast cafe ( I have never personally been but it's the only aboriginal restaurant left in the city if you're interested)

Parks (in city): Assiniboine park(the biggest one in the city), st vital park, Kildonan park
Parks/trails (out of city): Birds Hill (super close to city, a few hiking trails but mostly I go for the close greenerier 😅), spruce woods (more a camping ground but the sand domes are literally across the highway for hiking as well),  riding mountain, Selkirk MB park (nothing to special about this one but it does have a little forest in the back with a bit of a trail and a small marine exhibit before you enter the park)

We had no insulation in the basement at all and the insulation upstairs was so bad we had a jar of spaghetti freeze and break in the cupboards. For the cavity insulation (upstairs) we used Above All. They are on their list of approved contractors.  For the basement we did the retail rebate and used Home Depot to buy all the materials and do everything ourselves. 

&#x200B;

Because we did a different program, you will have to reach out to a company or companies that are registered with them about what is covered and what is not and how it works, but for us (again, not on the assistance program), we were only covered for a portion of the insulation costs and none of the ""secondary"" costs. Additionally, we had a rebate, which meant that we were out of pocket all the expenses and they submitted the paperwork to Efficiency MB who mailed us a cheque months and months later. 

&#x200B;

For the wall cavity (upstairs), we were given 2 options on how to proceed. The first was from inside, the second was from outside. The company drilled holes into the wall, near the bottom, middle and top, then sprayed blown in cellulose into the drilled holes. Finally they inserted wooden plugs to fill the holes. We opted to go through the outside as I was residing the house anyways and our walls are 1944 original plaster so we did not want the mess inside the house. 

&#x200B;

For you, I am sure the wall cavity insulation would be similar but I am not sure what would be included for you using a different program. You will need to talk to one of their registered contractors. The link below is to their ""registered"" contractors who will be able to tell you what exactly is covered, what is not, how your particular program works, etc.

"You don’t need to buy massive bulk - you need to buy based on $/g and $/nutrients. 

Now, I don’t know where you are talking about. I have called every superstore in Winnipeg - the cheapest one they had was $2 for the 200g Swanson's Beef Meat Pie. So .45lbs. 

So let’s call it in the middle and say they are $1.50 each X 10 = $15 or 4.5 lbs food. 

Aka cost per lb food - $3.33/lb 

Now let’s break this down. 
2.5kg (5.5lbs) no name all purpose flour - $4 
750g (1.65lbs) no name mixed veggies - $4
Ground beef (not on sale) $10/kg (1.6lbs) - $10

$18 for 8.75lbs

Ak cost per lb food - $2.05 per lb food. 

So you just saved yourself 1/3 your food cost, have healthier food. Non of those items are bulk. Not to mention you have way more flour then you need to make 10 pies and can make a dozen + loaves of bread from it. Which is even more savings.

"The purpose of the carbon tax is to put a price on carbon. It is the original Conservative, free market solution to carbon pollution.  It's been championed by many a right wing figure such as Preston Manning ...right up until the Liberals adopted it. Congratulations conservatives! You got your preferred solution in the end!  You won!

As to how it works, For individuals, the tax is revenue neutral so that folks are not pushed into the poor house as it rises.  Each person who files their taxes is rebated the average that a person in their category has probably spent on the carbon tax.  I.E. single male in 20s making X amount of dollars per year.

One may notice a loophole here.  If smart carbon choices are made, it's entirely possible that individuals can receive more in a rebate than spent on the carbon tax resulting in a net profit!  Conversely, should one make poor choices in terms of carbon useage, the rebate will not cover all the carbon they've caused.  

The carbon tax will continue to slowly ramp up as the market responds to demands for cleaner solutions and makes those solutions available.

That's the way it's intended to work for individuals.  For businesses and whatnot, I don't believe there's much in the way of rebate.  Instead, the revenue collected will go to pay for large projects that reduce the need for carbon emissions, such as public transit projects.  Or CCS for the oil industry.  

There's many ways to skin a cat.  We, in Canada, have gone with the free market solution.  We could have gone with hard regulation or with a carbon trading scheme.  All these ways could have worked.  In fact, if provinces like they can go their own way provided it meets or exceeds the federal backstop.

"The cynical viewpoint is that the idea is that if we jack up the prices through various means then people will be too poor to buy things and thus slow down consumption.

The carbon tax screws the middle and lower classes the worst. Yes theres a rebate and the supporters will tell you until they're blue in the face that you'll get back more than you pay but the math is flawed as it doesn't account for increase in cost of goods, just strictly the amount of carbon tax paid vs the rebate. If im not mistaken the latest study even shows now that around 60% will pay more this next year then they will receive back.

The idea makes sense on paper but like most green ideas there's always some drawbacks that will be downplayed so they cam sell the idea.

Personally I want us to move towards green energy but it needs to be done in a practical manner. There's no quick fix/switch. 
Also we should ramp up our own oil production and make sure its regulated properly instead of shutting it down and then begging for oil from countries who quite frankly don't give a d about climate change. Just because its being created somewhere else doesn't mean we're actually lowering our carbon footprint. Its just creative accounting. Use the tax revenue from our own oil to fund green energy.

"The point of a carbon tax is to account for the cost of using fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels costs more to the environment than their current market price suggests. Therefore, to account for that damage, the market needs to price in the environmental damage. As the price of carbon increases due to the carbon tax, the goal is to make it more economically feasible to use renewable energy sources instead of fossil fuels (and/or to reduce fossil fuel consumption). While this seems logical, the issue is that renewable energy sources are not yet available to all consumers. 

Replacing gas vehicles with electric ones is not an option for many consumers. Replacing a gas furnace for a heat pump may be viable for some but most cannot afford it currently. However, larger companies (many posting record profits) should be able to make investments to reduce their carbon footprint. Therefore the hope is that the carbon tax becomes cost neutral to citizens through the carbon tax rebates and not for many larger companies (with some controversial exceptions).

Manitoba produces a lot of hydroelectricity but we consume a lot of our energy from fossil fuel sources originating from out of province. Take a look here: https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-manitoba.html

In my opinion, a market-based solution like the carbon tax only works if there are substantial incentives accompanying the tax. For example, Saskatchewan's solar program. The solar program had more people installing personal solar grids than the province budgeted (meaning they were shifting to a more sustainable energy grid). However, the province stopped the program because it was too popular (and therefore costing the government ""too much"" in upfront costs). 

So, the carbon tax is supposed to be a market solution to shift to renewable energy sources but in reality seems to be a tax or fee that we pay while largely maintaining past practices.",t2_jun39bgn,SouthMB,0,1648495833.0,0,t1_i2h48o1,i2h48o1,True,BrewedinCanada,t3_tq9yy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manitoba/comments/tq9yy2/serious_question_about_carbon_tax_keep_it_civil/,"Serious question about carbon tax, keep it civil",/r/Manitoba/comments/tq9yy2/serious_question_about_carbon_tax_keep_it_civil/i2h48o1/,1,r/Manitoba,0,1

"So many excellent points has been made, so I won't repeat them.

In a nutshell, historically if we look at companies behaviours, we see that often when given the choice to do the right or the wrong thing, they will choose the inexpensive thing. More often than not, the inexpensive thing has been the wrong thing. For example, skimping on safety equipment or not training employees properly. Companies will continue to do the wrong thing until the government steps in and fines them, puts legislation in place, or brings criminal charges against them. The talk about climate change has been going in for a few decades now with little to no action from companies, especially the ones that put out more pollution like in the energy industry. Since companies respond when they get fines, this is the way to ""incentivize"" them to move towards cleaner energy solutions.

The biggest example of this is lead in products. Virtually no products have lead in them anymore because we know the long term damage it does to human beings. Even the ancient Romans documented how deadly lead is. But, since it was so cheap, lead was used in everything for centuries. Including food containers, paint, gasoline, toys, pencils, to name a few. It wasn't until the 1960's when a scientist named Clair Patterson found that the levels of lead in humans, air, water, food, and soil where much higher than they should be. He brought forth his findings to show we are polluting the world with lead due to industrial sources. This resulted in a decade long campaign from companies, mostly the oil industry, to discredit his name. He was threatened (his family as well, including death threats), passed up for grants, and shunned by the smeer campaign. Instead of adapting and removing an extremely harmful element from their products, companies chose the path of profits. It wasn't until the mid 1970's that the governement passed laws banning lead additives to products. Steep fines for companies still using lead. These measures are the reason we don't see leaded products anymore. In 1990, it was reported that humans had approximately 80% less lead in their systems compared to samples taken in the 1970's.",t2_7siml,aesoth,0,1648483825.0,0,t1_i2gavfd,i2gavfd,True,BrewedinCanada,t3_tq9yy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manitoba/comments/tq9yy2/serious_question_about_carbon_tax_keep_it_civil/,"Serious question about carbon tax, keep it civil",/r/Manitoba/comments/tq9yy2/serious_question_about_carbon_tax_keep_it_civil/i2gavfd/,9,r/Manitoba,0,9

One thing this article doesn't mention that my wife and I practice is ""bulk buying"".

However the course that Manitoba chose to take was to do nothing and force the federal government to collect those taxes instead. Funds which it returns back to the tax payer as a rebate. How much you receive as a rebate depends on your income and the average Manitoban gets back more than they spend (even if money in hand is preferred over money back at the end of the year).",t2_52952,L0ngp1nk,0,1648478349.0,0,t1_i2fxk4g,i2fxk4g,True,BrewedinCanada,t3_tq9yy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manitoba/comments/tq9yy2/serious_question_about_carbon_tax_keep_it_civil/,"Serious question about carbon tax, keep it civil",/r/Manitoba/comments/tq9yy2/serious_question_about_carbon_tax_keep_it_civil/i2fxk4g/,51,r/Manitoba,0,51
"We pay 14 cents a litre provincial tax, 10 cents federal, 8.8 cents carbon (and yes, it will increase 2.2 cents to 11 cents on Friday) and then we pay gst on all of it (so tax on tax). We don’t get a rebate on any of the other taxes though, like we do on carbon (unless you are one of those who still get a gst rebate). Farmers don’t pay carbon taxes on dyed gas (so for vehicles), and people who use their vehicles for work write off the gas (including the carbon tax) and then still get a rebate if they qualify.
Taxes suck, but why are we not discussing ALL taxes? 
And why are we not discussing corporate greed? Petroleum companies are making record profits- the top 4 (Chevron, Exxon, BP, Shell) earned 71 billion dollars in profit last year, 40% of that in the last quarter, when they started to raise prices before oil went up.

"It's like a 'tipping fee' for the atmosphere. 

When you burn gas, you are impacting people around you by adding carbon to the atmosphere. For most of the last century people have been free loaders by dumping pollution into the space of others and not paying for it. The carbon tax shows that there are other costs to your fuel uses and is slowly rising to meet those costs.

To say it doesn't do anything is to deny market-based economics. Prices change behaviour and increasing the cost of fuel makes alternatives more attractive. 

In provinces that are under the federal system, people get rebates for the average amount of tax a person will bay (with 10% more if they live in a rural area). Other provinces have their own system. So unless you drive a gas guzzler you are probably coming out ahead. 

The purpose is to reward people and companies who use less and to recover the costs from people and companies that use more. 

Manitoba is in good shape because our electricity won't feel the carbon tax since it comes from Hydro. Thanks to Keeyask we have lots of electric capacity and could easily handle more electric heating or electric vehicles.

I had a trade in and they wrote on paper what they would give me.... They included the tax on my trade but didn't include the tax on the new vehicle. They are over $100,000 vehicles so the taxes are significant. 

Then when they figured out the monthly payment he told me I would be paying the same as I do now. Again roughly on paper. 

When I went to pick up the vehicle a few months after it was built,  I lost more then 10k because of the tax spin and then my payments were $300 more a month then my previous vehicle .

"I strongly disagree. 

Consider the previous Fort Whyte elections. Since 1999, it's been a stronghold for the Conservatives, who regularly destroy the competition. That's why the leaders of the party have historically ran there. 

This election saw them receive more than 2,500 fewer votes whil the NDP only lost about 700 and the Liberals **gained** over 1,000. Khan won the riding by a mere 197 votes, and given that it's a 'Conservative' riding, it's fair to say that more people voted *against* him than *for* him. 

If my opinion isn't good enough for you, how about [Dan Lett's](https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/local/fort-whyte-warning-shot-for-tory-government-576323522.html), [Bartley Kives'](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/khan-pcs-margin-victory-fort-whyte-byelection-1.6394125), or [Sam Thompson's](https://globalnews.ca/news/8703241/tight-byelection-fort-whyte-manitoba-pcs/)?

"My wife and I really like going out to Clear Lake and if you have a puppy there are some pet friendly cabins. Lots of great walking around, paved paths should be free of snow (but I imagine wild paths won't be great) and the restaurants, coffee shop are all great and open now. 

In the city, Assiniboine park is a really nice walk and you can either walk across the bridge to North side and see cool older wolsely, or stay on the South side and see some big ol mansions and the new pathway is pretty nice. If you like board games then across the board is a really good hang, and then either eat there or there are tons of restaurants in exchange from ""fast food"" poutine to sit down places too. Kings head is a good destination as well.

The new place 116 on Sherbrooke is pretty cool but a little pricey, also on that street is tallest poppy (their chicken and waffles with berry syrup is amazing) and magic bird (excellent fried chicken). If you like bagels , or bagel sandwiches, Hudson's is right there. 

If you are looking for somewhere to shop, and maybe pick up some good meals for the week, black Market is a great stop in South Osborne. Small shop but lots of great sides like mustards, hot sauces, pickled things and others but also breads, soups salads etc. Really big on alternative foods (not pushy just aware of different needs) so they have lots of options like gluten free, vegetarian, vegan etc. They do have great options to go there so I usually pick up a ruffles chip rice krispie square and then go walking with my wife and pup in South Osborne Neighbourhoods, specifically Kingston Crescent is really nice and you can park by BDI and walk across the bridge. 

I guess it's pretty clear I walk neighbourhoods a lot and wildwood is another one I'd recommend. 

For staying, if you do that, Inn at the forks is nice. Smith is good food, and there are so many walking opportunities from there. True North Square isn't far from there and if your partner likes beer the lake of the woods tap room is there and they have good stuff. Also upstairs is a bunch of good restaurants (I enjoyed the BBQ joint there).

While you can sit on your right to sue, it would be worthwhile having in writing from a lawyer the last day you can file without being out of time.  Manitoba will be replacing  The Limitations of Actions Act this fall, which could reduce the 6 year limit to 2.

"Take a gander into the history of the person I was *actually* speaking to.  I did make an assumption at first but my assumptions were correct.

There were always rules for collecting cerb. You had to have been working prior to the pandemic, have met an income threshold, not been collecting other income, etc.

There are some folks that got pushed into different programs to ensure they had income during the pandemic. It was up to each Canadian to ensure they met these regulations before claiming any funds. Otherwise they'd have to pay it back. You don't just get money for free. However I do 100% support Trudeau for ensuring the money went to people quickly so they didn't get evicted or starve (even though evictions weren't possible for some time).

The government is also allowing people to pay back these funds *tax free* within a certain time frame. The eligibility requirements were pretty clear. If you weren't eligible you were quite frankly stealing funds from taxpayers.

Also, heads up, coming in hot like a douchebag and demanding people explain themselves doesn't usually work. You may want to change your plan of attack in the future to something less abrasive. Lucky for you I'm in a good mood and felt like being helpful.

"Are you an employee or independent contractor?

What's the value of the missing commission payment? This will inform whether a small claim is appropriate.  It's been awhile, but my recollection is that small claims max out at $15k in Manitoba, so if your commission is significantly higher, a small claim may not be appropriate.

Does your contract indicate that unpaid commissions stop being payable in any circumstances?  Your contract almost certainly won't say this, but it would be a good idea for you to review the terms of payment to ensure that you are owed the commission.
