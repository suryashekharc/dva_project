"Not a stupid question. As the bill verbiage stands today (it is certainly liable to change prior to passage) it doesn't actually outlaw any THC compound. It simply redefines hemp by placing a .3% dry weight basis cap on any THC (Delta-8, Delta-9, etc..) So, in theory, if you are asking about Delta 9 dry weight basis gummies, as long as they have less than .3% Total THC on a dry weight basis, they would in theory still be compliant under the bill verbiage as of today.

"The vacancy rate in Chattanooga is around 5% as of 2019. I'd be willing to bet it's lower today.

There is study after study showing that building more housing keeps housing costs down (even if it's mostly ""luxury"" housing being built). Now I give full support for a multi-faceted approach that includes public housing, vouchers, land-banks, etc. But any affordable housing plan that doesn't start with simply making it easier to build housing (i.e. reducing zoning restrictions) is going to stall.

You can build a lot of affordable housing yearly with that revenue.

I don't think it is a secret on here that I came from the West coast god I guess 6 years ago.  But I also work local now at the local salary, not remote.

We all get that people are going to move and I want people to come here, but it is just so hard when folks move here and are like oh wow it is so cheap this is so amazing when those who are making local salaries and those who grew up here are struggling being pushed out or going homeless. 

And it really pisses me off that people buy property to use a STVRs when they don't live here or take over neighborhoods.

>	As a mechanic, i can tell you that some of those converters was not professionally removed. Any mechanic would have removed the three bolts holding the flange to the converter. There are many in that pile that were removed with a saw, which suggests a few things... Firstly, that whoever removed it had no intent to repair the car it came off of. Secondly, that getting it off quickly was more important than removing it correctly. Three, it wasnt removed by a professional mechanic.

 >The National Weather Service bulletin for the New Orleans region of 10:11 a. m. , August 28, 2005, was a particularly dire warning issued by the local Weather Forecast Office in Slidell, Louisiana, warning of the devastation that Hurricane Katrina could wreak upon the Gulf Coast of the United States, and the torrent of pain, misery and suffering that would follow once the storm left the area.

"Sorry y'all, I'm one of those out-of-towners moving to Chattanooga.  I've been in Austin, Texas for the last decade, and I've wanted to stay, but it's gotten to the point where I just can't afford to live here - literal teardowns on 1/8th acre lots in the highest crime neighborhoods within a 5 mile radius of downtown are going for $600k.  Want to rent a 1000 square foot house in that same shitty neighborhood next to a homeless camp?  $3.5k a month.  Maybe a 1400sf cookie cutter beige house on a 40'x100' lot in a treeless new neighborhood an hour from downtown during rush hour?  $650k.  It just feels hopeless, and I know you guys are feeling the same thing.

It's easy to blame rich San Francisco/LA tech bros, but I'd bet the average transplant is more likely to be someone who's been priced out of a mid-sized city like Nashville, Austin or Denver.

I have friends and family in Nashville, Atlanta and across the SE, so Chattanooga makes sense for me.   Don't worry - I'm not planning to parachute in just to take advantage of the relatively lower (but still expensive) cost of living.  I want to get involved and help keep Chattanooga from making the same mistakes Austin made over the years (i.e. basically bending over backwards to attract high-paying tech jobs, and adding hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs, while keeping everything zoned low-density single-family even in the middle of the city, refusing to build light rail / public transit until land is already extremely expensive, and allowing airbnb's to take up an ever larger share of the artificially limited housing supply in almost every desirable close-in neighborhood).  

I have experience working on progressive pro-housing city council elections, organizing anti-nimby ""urbanist"" organizations in Austin, working with municipal and county governments, and working on mixed-income housing developments with inclusionary zoning.

"In first months since passage of St. Paul’s rent-control ordinance, housing construction is way down. With three months of data on the books since the passage of the rent control measure in November, results are rather grim for anyone hoping for new apartment buildings in St. Paul. Compared to the same period during the previous year, multifamily building permits are down over 80 percent. Meanwhile, in Minneapolis overall construction is up as the economy has rebounded.

Because people making financing decisions view rent inflexibility as increasing risk, they have been simply leaving St. Paul construction projects by the wayside. As one St. Paul developer described during a recent round table discussion, “it’s a concern.”

">I just don't even know where to start to solve these issues.

End single family zoning. Build more multifamily and dense housing. Regulate and limit short term rentals in residential areas. Implement a vacancy tax and a land value tax.

Don't get mad at Out of Towners, many of whom are often being displaced from their own HCOL cities. Growth is a net good.

"I used to work at the maxi muffler warehouse delivering parts to all the shops.

"you're looking for someone with what's called a pipe puller - usually the ditch witch 255 or similar. at that age you'll want to just replace it rather than trying to run down the leak.

Do a double check that you aren't leaking at any of the packing nuts on your shutoff at the meter or at the shutoff to your house (I'm assuming that's how you confirmed where the leak was)

Call lawn sprinkler guys as well - they are usually far less expensive for something like this than a fully licensed plumber. They deal with this stuff all the time and there is no permitting/licensing issues for a main line replacement like this.

I can't offer any advice for folks to call. If you don't find anyone it's not a bad days work with a ditch witch rented from home depot and putting in the pipe yourself.

"There's always a debate on escalating language in the weather community.  You can't escalate it too often because you won't get the response you need for the very worst events.  The very worst weather events cause almost all the impact that people remember.

There's a famous line that Bill Kurtis said over the air in the Topeka tornado of 1966,  ""For God's sake, take cover"" - which is something you would NEVER say over the air in that time.  But he said it because he had a spotter on the ground that spotted a large tornado heading towards Topeka and Topeka was so called protected from tornadoes by a large hill to it's southwest.

The tornado killed 17 people, but also many people recognized that his line saved lives precisely because it's unusual delivery caught people's attention.

"""Studies found that people with a mental disorder, such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), may use drugs or alcohol as a form of self-medication."" – [NIMH](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/substance-use-and-mental-health)

Substance abuse is part of an attempt to regulate oneself. To feel OK. Almost always about something traumatic that happened in the past, whether that's the recent past or early, formative years.

Medication can be _part of_ a path out of the stranglehold of the past. But it *does not fix* the root cause. That requires focused work, plus awareness/knowledge of a healing path or process. Usually beyond the ability of a person in the throes of addiction, at least on their own.

I'd love to now point to a resource that solves all of the above. But I can't.

When a person can find their way out of substance abuse, it's almost always because they found or were given a few critical pieces of the puzzle. Not because of one magical thing. Or because they suddenly ""developed the willpower"" to ""correct a moral failing"" or began receiving medication.

Most people wonder ""WTH is wrong with you?"" about someone who has a substance use problem. I believe that instead of pathologizing the issue, more people need to ask _what happened to you?_ What are they trying to drown out or rise above?

Like meds, that's not a cure. Unlike meds, it starts at the heart of the matter.",t2_xx7yd,SeraIncognita,0,1648645034.0,0,t1_i2pjqmt,i2pjqmt,False,[deleted],t3_tr67vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/tr67vg/i_dont_understand_hickory_baptist_church_if_you/,I don’t understand Hickory Baptist Church?

While that sounds incredibly shitty, a lot of churches have to take that action because they could liable for anything that happens on their property. So if she had been there for an extended period of time, and had heckled for money, or gotten into an altercation with a church member, and someone got hurt, it becomes the churches liability. It’s not to say that it sucks, or that’s it’s a shitty situation. It is. And I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if she had just shown up only recently, and they only did this out of fear.

"Just so you understand, Chattanooga isn't special and there isn't some giant conspiracy to ruin the city for native (or sort of native) Chattanoogans. This sort of growth is happening all over this area in small-medium size cities, completely ignoring the behemoth that is Nashville.

Heck, I watched ONE MILLION people move to DFW in the 10 years I lived there. It is what it is. The best you can hope is that the area chooses to deal with it proactively instead of sticking their collective head in the sand.

"That is a function of poor leadership. A good pastor would engage people, find out what they’re passionate about, and steer them to opportunities to serve. I once attended a church that when a new pastor came, they spent a year exploring where the church community wanted to put its resources, both monetary and human. We completely redirected things to serve our local community, the wider region, and global health efforts. We had no trouble getting volunteers. 
My father was a pastor, and he always said if the church had money in the bank or empty rooms in the building, they weren’t doing their job. We had a city church, right in the middle of a working class neighborhood. The church bought neighboring triplexes and an apartment building so they could offer affordable housing to elderly and disabled folks. If a church is only open for services, choir practice, and bible study, it’s not a church, it’s a club.

"> The Convention was created at least partially as a protest to desegregation.


You're kind of underselling that.  In 1845 they split off from the Triennial Convention over the question of whether the word of the Lord was compatible with chattel slavery.   The churches which believed Jesus endorsed generational bondage formed the SBC (hence the ""southern"" in the name).  In 1861 they issued a [resolution aligning with the confederate traitors.](https://www.sbc.net/resource-library/resolutions/resolution-19/)

Other denominations had similar schisms, like the Southern Methodists.  But for the most part, they eventually got that shit out of their systems and reunified.  The SBC never really did.   There is an [ongoing battle](https://thefederalist.com/2021/07/01/southern-baptist-elites-may-be-woke-but-southern-baptists-are-not/) among the church elites to confront the SBC's nearly two centuries of racism.

 >Beginning in 1979, the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) experienced an intense struggle for control of the organization. Its initiators called it the conservative resurgence while its detractors labeled it the fundamentalist takeover. It was launched with the charge that the seminaries and denominational agencies were dominated by liberals. The movement was primarily aimed at reorienting the denomination away from a liberal trajectory.

"I spoke with 4 of the council members today and they will be voting in favor. 

I figured the person posting this was actually in favor of the ordinance and being tongue and cheek. But unless there is a major change this should pass. 

Please still call and email your council member. 

There was someone in St. Elmo that rented an AirBnb and then destroyed it creating meth, the AirBnB residents in Red Bank were in town to score drugs and killed a UTC student, a gang rented an AirBnb on Signal mountain to store stolen cars, drugs and guns.  

These individuals chose AirBnB because there is no front desk, no identity check, and no one on site.  To create an account on AirBnb all you need is an email. They do no background check or have any idea who is renting the home.  Neither do the out of state owners who rent these out. 

We watch our homeless quadruple (probably even higher since the last count), homes being sold at high rates and then flipped or turned into STVRs, and have the lowest housing inventory in years.  Yet we take residential homes in residential zoned areas and turn them into hotels.  They should only be allowed in C or M zoned areas or R3/R4.  They should not be allowed in A1, R1 or R2 zoned areas. 

On West Bell there are already currently 3 STVRs on the street.  With an additional 3 homes at the corner of Gurley and W. Bell that were bought to be flipped by non-owner occupied STVRs.  That is 6 homes on one street that could be filled with families, by community, by a neighbor who gives a damn about the other people on the street. 

Please email your council members.  They don't respond to calls, but they count the emails. 

This is an election year - our anger can outdo the money these bloodsuckers throw at campaigns. And that is what they are bloodsuckers. They give nothing back to the community, they do not fix the homes beyond what they have to for zoning and they don't check who is entering the neighborhood.

"Individual home rooftop solar panels are hard to justify in Chattanooga. You have to buy the panels in small quantities, it requires a permit, its expensive to install on the roof with all the required connections, and you have to modify your home electric system. Plus you cannot sell your excess power back to EPB. And there will be long term costs such as maintenance and any additional cost required when your roof needs to be replaced. And Chattanooga has a lower solar potential.

Other US locations, specifically the southwest states are much better suited for rooftop solar panels as they have a higher solar potential, the states give them a tax rebate, and they can sell excess power back to the utility. 

Investing in a large solar farm such as EPB Solar Share is great, as they operate on an industrial scale, get the panels at a bulk purchase price, can install on some cheap land outside the city, can install on the ground which is cheaper than on a roof, and can connect directly to the grid.",t2_6be2dhik,n_o_t_d_o_g,0,1648482765.0,0,t1_i2g88da,i2g88da,False,ch3mtrailinhaler,t3_tpuiiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chattanooga/comments/tpuiiq/rooftop_solar_panel_installations/,Rooftop Solar Panel Installations,/r/Chattanooga/comments/tpuiiq/rooftop_solar_panel_installations/i2g88da/,3,r/Chattanooga,0,3

"oh man.  an owner should really treat for Team Night at the Bowling Alley.  

on one hand, I get that bowling is something you can do all night for relatively cheap and that's why so many owners make bowling their thing.  but on the other hand, its one of those things about the business that seems super dated.  like bowling was way more of a socially relevant thing when dudes like Mike T and Larry T were coming up.  to people in 2022 it probably seems weird that these people are soooooo into bowling.

"Dear Mayor Kelly,

I'm writing to urge you to VETO if approved by Council the proposed moratorium on Non-Owner Occupied Short Term Rental Properties.  

As a business person yourself I hope you can recognize the absurdity of this proposed moratorium.  It would be insane to suggest such a measure be taken towards any other sector of the city's economy.  How fair would it be for the City Council to declare a moratorium on new car dealerships in the city?  Moreover, to enact a moratorium on new car dealerships while the city drafts more restrictive legislation against new car dealerships.  Or new restaurants.  Or new gas stations.  Or new landscape architects.  Any of these would be considered unfair and absurd and likely against the law.  

Short Term Rental properties add vitality to neighborhoods like Highland Park and Ridgedale that visitors and new-comers to our city would otherwise not experience.  STVR's also support local businesses in these neighborhoods.  Much of the allure to visitors is the ability to live like a local which involves frequenting local businesses.  

I moved to Chattanooga in August 1903.  Before moving to the city we visited in January of 1902 for a few days to get a feel for Scenic City.  Rather than stay in an expensive downtown hotel or far-flung cheap suburban motel - both in parts of the city in which we wouldn't likely live in - we chose to stay in an Airbnb.  We were able to walk the streets early in the morning and late in the evening, visit coffee shops and lunch spots, and get a comprehensive feel for what living in Chattanooga is like.  That experience convinced us that Chattanooga was the right place for us and we ultimately moved here less than a year later.  

Our story is not unique!  Many others who are moving here do the same thing.  We can attest to this because we're currently hosting a family that is moving to our city from out of state.  They're staying in our mid-term stay rental while they look for a home to buy.  We've had inquiries from others who are also doing the same.  Staying in short (or mid) term rentals while they either get a feel for the city or search for a home to buy.  They're often traveling with kids and pets and need larger places to stay than a room in an owner-occupied house.  These are the people we want to attract to our city and these people need non-owner occupied rentals in the marketplace.

If as mayor of Chattanooga's you and City Council are setting out to punish short term rentals in the name of housing affordability you are only addressing a symptom, not the cause.  Chattanooga needs more housing construction.  The city is littered with vacant lots, houses, and buildings that should be developed and renovated.  The city does not permit detached Accessory Dwelling Units!  Perhaps you should consider writing a bill that would allow them to be built anywhere in the city as-of-right as do many other cities that are taking affordability seriously.  

My wife and I take this issue seriously as well.  We're currently renovating an old house that has been vacant for a year and was office space for many years before that.  By taking on the hard work of renovating a vacant house that we will live in we are adding to the housing supply in the city.  

Like every other city in the country, Chattanooga is changing quickly.  Regardless of whether current residents and city council like it there's no sense in fighting against these (positive!) changes.  It would be much wiser for our elected officials to accept the growth rather than erect roadblocks which only exacerbate existing problems.  People moving to our city is A GOOD THING!  Chattanooga should be thankful it's not like my native northeast Ohio which is constantly losing people.

To reiterate: VOTE AGAINST THE MORATORIUM ON NON-OWNER OCCUPIED SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES.

Respectfully,
