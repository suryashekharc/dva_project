"The problem here is that you think you know what you are talking about, so you don't listen or bother to read about what is actually going on. No one is taking home a big paycheck and people are getting diverted into housing. 

You are not going to find the evidence you seek arguing with folks who are replying to you while on the crapper or typing with one hand while holding a bus pole on their commute. You actually have to read papers and articles on the topic. Ones that argue points you may not agree with. 

The real answer is that it's complicated, but doing nothing and arresting everyone hasn't worked. That's been the policy since the 70s and the problem is much bigger now. In almost every case where the peanut gallery is asking for ""evidence"" the answer is that most of these programs are 3-4 years old and we just had a pandemic and fentanyl just came on the scene so the evidence is murky as shit as we don't have a Justice League to come in and wipe away all of societies ills.

"Well, since you‚Äôre being so nice‚Ä¶

Is it really that difficult to see that the author entangled two ultra progressive ideas in one piece?  Incarceration AND police.  

My point was simple, and you couldn‚Äôt disagree with it, so you used an ad hominem attack.  The author staged their piece under the premise that police funding increased and crime has not decreased IN A 3 MONTH WINDOW.  It is objectively an absurd argument.

Then, they use that same kind of cherrypicking/sample size awful data science to pull from
one city (Sacramento) to say that over incarceration is the root evil that has failed the system.

Clearly an agenda, clearly not hard to read between the lines.  Opinion here is not the problem though, it‚Äôs faulty data science driven by that agenda.  The author could have inserted comprehensive data, extensive graphs, but nah, truth doesn‚Äôt matter against the propaganda

> Quarters 1 was built as part of the initial wave of building construction that established the Naval Training Station, on what was then known as Goat Island, as an active base between 1900 and 1923. The first barracks and the Commander's Quarters were completed in 1900.

"Happened to me twice.  Both times the front plate was left and the rear plate was swapped. First time it happened a cop knocked on my door and explained i had the tag of a stolen vehicle (same make/model vehicle but different color) on my car and he was super cool about it.  He explained thieves swap the plates until they get the stolen car out of the area. This is how i also learned that cop cars scan plates passively, unless they checked every Honda street parked on Potrero Hill. Second time i was pulled over in the Mission and thought i was going to jail. Backup was called and an officer on a power trip claimed a thief replacing my plate with a plate from another car ‚Äúwould be like somebody breaking into your house and fixing the window on the way out.‚Äù I explained to him that it happned to me before and he was not pleased at my rebuttal. He asked me how i couldn‚Äôt have noticed my plate was incorrect i said something like ‚Äúi didnt get under the car and check my brake lines either, i just assumed they were working like they always do, i dont have a pre-drive checklist.‚Äù  Again the wrong decision. If i didnt look like a yuppy idiot with his goldendoodle in the pssenger seat i dont think i would have driven away.

Nope. Under citizen‚Äôs arrest a citizen can use reasonable force to arrest a perpetrator. Penal code 837 states citizens can place another citizen under arrest when a felony has been in fact committed, and he has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it.

UA also positions themselves to get a lot of money from the city/county through grants and contracts.

Nope. Under citizen‚Äôs arrest a citizen can use reasonable force to arrest a perpetrator. Penal code 837 states citizens can place another citizen under arrest when a felony has been in fact committed, and he has reasonable cause for believing the person arrested to have committed it. 

Seeing the people breaking in is your reasonable cause for citizens arrest and under it you are granted authority to use reasonable force (stopping a criminal with a car) to arrest a perpetrator.

"Ahhh, the famous Tinkerbell‚Ä¶üòÑ
We‚Äôve run into him numerous times at that exact intersection and also other nearby ones such as Sacramento and Baker. The first time, we, along with another couple, were trying to help what we thought was a lost cat and ended up following him around for 45 minutes until he finally let us close enough to read his tag, which said that Tinkerbell is ‚Äúan outdoor cat who is also very chatty.‚Äù He tolerated us for almost an hour as we tried to corral him away from the heavy traffic of Divisadero, and then he disappeared into someone‚Äôs fenced yard and wouldn‚Äôt come out. 

The second time we saw him, a concerned citizen was trying to catch him to return him home and asked for our help. We instantly recognized the squirrelly bastard this time and again read his tag but this time was able to read the other side too, which had his home address on California Street. We worried about the heavy traffic on California, so we again corralled/escorted him to his home near California and Baker which took forever because herding a cat was as hard as, well, herding a cat. Got him to the front door, rang the doorbell multiple times, but no one answered. 

Flagged down the neighbor next door, who just happened to be returning home, and she said that she too had tried to catch Tinkerbell numerous times before, thinking he was a lost cat, and had no idea he was actually her next door neighbor this whole time. üòÖ Being a cat lover, she said she‚Äôd start keeping food and water out for him, and that was the last time we saw the infamous Tinkerbell.

"I hate to say this because generally speaking I believe in the whole mindset of ‚Äúif you see something, say something,‚Äù but that‚Äôs more in reference to someone (like a regular person, not someone high on meth) in distress or maybe just needs an extra set of eyes like another single woman or elderly person. But in this case, I would do nothing. Unless someone is being assaulted, I‚Äôd call the police then, but for a car break-in, I‚Äôm not doing anything. 

Anyway, I‚Äôve witnessed several car break-ins totally by chance, and my thought is GTFO of there immediately. There is no need to make my presence known, I don‚Äôt feel I need to get a description. My goal is zero type of interaction with the criminal. What‚Äôs more, in case they‚Äôve spotted me at all, I‚Äôm getting my car out of there and going someplace else. I‚Äôm not interested in a confrontation or being retaliated against. 

One night I‚Äôd planned to go to Daiso at Serramonte and was finishing up a phone call in my car that was backed in.

"I‚Äôll be the unpopular opinion here‚Äîas someone who goes to the TL four days a week for a recovery program. The Urban Alchemy guys (and gals) are mostly folks who just got out of prison, and are being trained in community outreach. 

Part of the duty is picking up trash early in the morning. If you are awake and outside at 7am, they‚Äôre coming down the streets and picking up EVERY bit of trash, including biohazard stuff. 

They also get people up who are sleeping in doorways or blocking sidewalks, and check on people who might have ODed. I‚Äôve ridden by one of them who had called in a OD, administered Narcan (which they all carry), and was waiting for the ambulance. That‚Äôs got to be an emotionally draining part of the job. 

They will firmly but politely tell people exhibiting antisocial behavior, like smoking their foil right on the street, to knock it off. They know most of the TL people and can talk them down a lot better than what happens with police. 

I‚Äôve only seen good things. But I was thinking about how the Guardian Angels eventually got rather thuggish, and I wonder how they‚Äôre structured to avoid that tendency.

"Background:
 
https://civilgrandjury.sfgov.org/2020_2021/2021%20CGJ%20Report_Van%20Ness%20Avenue%20-%20What%20Lies%20Beneath.pdf
 
See page 4:
 
*""The Van Ness Avenue corridor serves as both a vital connector of San Francisco neighborhoods and a regional link for travel between Marin, San Francisco, and San Mateo Counties. Van Ness Avenue is one of the busiest north-south corridors in the City, spanning  two miles from Lombard Street to Mission Street. In 2003, 75% of San Francisco voters approved Proposition K, a sales tax to provide rapid transit service on Van Ness Avenue.""*

> Proposition B in 1989 promised to improve transit on Van Ness. It included a sales tax increase that was supposed to fund these improvements. 

Correct, but this was a sales tax, authorized by the ballot measure, to increase transit general *funding*.

The sales tax measure, both past and proposed extensions are independent from capital projects, which also include federal funding, CA State Transportation funding, funding authorized in the state legislation, etc. (the city's sales tax alone would not have funded any of these capital infrastructure projects), including, but not limited to the following:

* Van Ness BRT (2003)

* Geary Boulevard BRT

* Central Subway

* Taravel Avenue

etc.

Individual planning of *capital projects* are separate, and begin when the SFMTA Board commences a formal proceeding.

Also, the Van Ness project was unique in that it was a joint project with SFPUC (water) and SF Public Works (sewer).  Despite the three city agencies, the SFMTA Board administered the entire project, including contracting, bidding, construction management, etc. (engineering management, design, etc. was undertaken by the respective agency).  These non-transportation projects also included both state and federal funding, including Prop 50 State of CA State Water Bonds and federal infrastructure funding.  To note, the surface portion of the Van Ness BRT capital project was on schedule.  All the Van Ness delays were attributed to the underground, primarily due to the SFMTA Boards decision to place the BRT lanes in the center versus the curbside, which required both the water and sewer facilities to be abandoned and relocated, versus repair (i.e. cured in place lining, CIPL, which has been done on Mission Street, and other areas of SFPUC repair projects), which would have added ~75 years versus ~100-120 years by replacement.

See page 10:

*""Had the side-lane BRT design been selected, there would not have been an immediate need
to move both the water and sewer lines.""*",t2_3miua,abourne,0,1648956768.0,0,t1_i36k3m7,i36k3m7,False,AutoModerator,t3_tug9rs,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tug9rs/daily_bullshit_saturday_april_2_2022/,"DAILY BULLSHIT ‚Äî Saturday April 2, 2022",/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tug9rs/daily_bullshit_saturday_april_2_2022/i36k3m7/,1,r/sanfrancisco,0,1

"> Hipcamps with people advertising their driveways for hire for RV's.

if these spots are inside the city of San Francisco, they're probably a place to STORE the RV... roadtrip.. need safe place to park.. visitors probably staying in hotels because they're in a city. when you go to an RV park, they have full services.. water, sewage and power.. but that's when you stay in the RV.

&#x200B;

if you want to sleep in your car somewhere in the city.. **DO NOT DO THIS.** 

everything you have in the car will be stolen in a matter of hours... they break tinted glass just to get a better look.

"Muir Woods is overrated. I went once with friends who were visiting and it's literally meant for that: tourists who want easy access to redwoods. There aren't really any good trails in Muir Woods itself. Plus, not dog friendly. And crawling with tourists and staff, so there is rarely peace and quiet. Check out some hikes in the East Bay (like Joaquin Miller) or San Rafael (Baltimore Canyon) for better options that are less crowded and are actually dog friendly.

"It is with deep regret that I ask for this retraction in public. The solution presented states that there is no identifying information in the Zodiac z340 cipher and that is patently incorrect. Law Enforcement, The FBI, SFPD Homicide, Napa County Sheriffs and Vallejo PD all have this as an open case and are currently 'reviewing' Old and New Leads. This Chronicle submission gives validation to a solution that makes no sense and shuts down the ability for anyone else in private or public to be heard on the subject. The publics input in solving cold cases is invaluable and the only thing this endorsement serves is self-promotion. 

The Zodiac wrote up to 11 cards, letters, and notes about his crimes and potential crimes. He and maybe others brutally killed lovers at Lake Berryessa, Lake Herman Road and bragged about more killings, while terrorizing a community with threats of bombing school buses of little children. 

The San Francisco Chronicle, a Jewel of publication and a star in the business, should not be involved in the suppression of information, directly or indirectly with this erroneous report.

"9th and Irving great area for eats, small shopping, and leads into Golden Gate Park. Academy of Sciences is near by which is great for children.

Presidio for some beach time at Baker Beach, there's a old school bowling ally near Crissy Field and you can walk across Golden Gate Bridge.

Pier 39 is a obvious tourist family destination.

North Beach for family Italian dinners, few site seeing spots like the TransAmerica Building.

Taking a ferry from the ferry building to Sausalito, they have cute shops and killer ice cream spots. Seeing the city from the other side is nice.

The open drug use has been condensed to an area of the city that frankly children have no business in because there aren't any schools, or kid attractions in those areas besides the community parks which local families with children use, and it's pretty obvious when you look. Sure, you may be going down Vanness and see some users, but they're harmless because they're high and stick to themselves. You may run into homeless in other parts of the city if you're exploring upper Haight, but frankly they're people who're minding their business 98% of the time.

I'd be more concerned with the dog poop on the ground than the needles. You'd have to really walk into the Tenderloin to get those needles. But, dog shit is everywhere in this city. There are more dogs than children in SF.

"Calloway does a great job of putting stats into perspective, especially by using both percentages and actual numbers. And he's right that the effort to recall D.A. Boudin has heightened the political implications of a skewed picture of how SF has fared, crime-wise, in the last year or two. 

What he did not address, however, was a ""storyline"" that could impact the outcome of June's special recall election -- crimes aimed at Asian Americans. As much as I appreciate an objective *macro*\-view of SF, residents experience the city as individuals and members of communities. 

To be clear: I'm NOT saying the D.A. has or hasn't failed any particular group while in office.

Golden Gate Park has many lovely attractions. The Presidio has gorgeous hiking. Cable cars are fun for tourists. Personally, I'd skip Fisherman's Wharf / Pier 39 because it's a tourist trap, but then, many tourists seem to like tourist traps! For older kids, the Exploratorium on the Embarcadero is fantastic. Alcatraz is completely safe and surprisingly fun, with the unexpected inclusion of being a rather beautiful place to walk around (outside the prison) and a bird sanctuary.  Muir Woods is outside SF to the north over the GGB and is gorgeous. Taking a ferry basically anywhere is fun, because you get such beautiful views - you can take a ferry to Alcatraz, Angel Island (historically the Ellis Island of the West), Sausalito for fun walks and shopping and lunch, etc etc.

In 1985, a 40-foot-long (12-meter) humpback entered San Francisco Bay and was followed closely on the evening news by Bay Area television stations.\[5\] After a few days in the bay, the whale, nicknamed Humphrey,\[6\] swam up the Sacramento River into a freshwater habitat. The whale, first spotted at Oakland's Outer Harbor October 10, 1985,\[6\] swam up the Carquinez Strait, the Sacramento River and under the Rio Vista Bridge to a dead-end slough 69 miles (111 kilometers) from the ocean.\[7\]\[8\]

With the assistance of numerous fish and wildlife agencies, including the Army's 481st Transportation Company (Heavy Boat), the crew led him the many miles back down the Sacramento river, alternately playing and not playing the whale songs to keep his interest. Large numbers of spectators lined the banks of the river.",t2_9hxpy,reddit455,0,1648929050.0,0,t1_i356sl7,i356sl7,True,IMovedYourCheese,t3_tuqbsv,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tuqbsv/did_anyone_else_see_a_whale_or_something_else/,Did anyone else see a whale (or something else) under the bay bridge earlier today?,/r/sanfrancisco/comments/tuqbsv/did_anyone_else_see_a_whale_or_something_else/i356sl7/,8,r/sanfrancisco,0,8

Still too slow. From NYT:
 >The public transit system in San Francisco, which carries 700,000 riders a day, is among the slowest in the nation
 
>with some lines stopping at nearly every block ‚Äî and in at least a dozen cases, twice on the same block. M.T.A. officials concede that 69 percent of the stops are too close together even by the agency‚Äôs own standards
 
>...has recommended ‚Äústop consolidation‚Äù as a cheap and easy way to speed travel..
 
 
Of course there's tremendous opposition among a vocal minority to following national and international stop distance standards, but the ""Rapid"" which was formally the ""limited"" could save as much time as this entire project by limiting more stops and leaving the regular bus to stop constantly.
 
>‚ÄúThey feel they need the cover of 400 public meetings and 17 years of planning to do some really obvious stuff like stop consolidation,‚Äù said Tom Radulovich, executive director at the nonprofit advocacy group Livable City. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very minimal investment, it‚Äôs reversible, and it can be a fairly high payback.‚Äù

"Don‚Äôt listen to these two, I knew exactly what you meant. SF neighborhoods are so small I often group them together by cardinal direction and it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt have a specific preference but want to be where the fun stuff is. The gatekeeping in this sub is so strange sometimes. 

Not sure what your budget is but for these critieria you might want to look at the Fairmont or Mark Hopkins. The former has Tonga Room (famous and fun but still tacky tiki bar) and the latter has Top of the Mark. Neither are particularly awesome but the hotels are nice and they are both close to some excellent bars if you‚Äôre willing to venture down the hill into the tenderloin. Make a res at Bourbon and Branch!
