Essentially both my GF and I were working tech jobs recently working maybe 10 hours per week. We both figured we were being a little too lazy, so we sought out new jobs with higher salaries and maybe work 20-30 hours per week, mainly because we feel bad working less at our salaries. 

Our experience is not uncommon from what many of our friends have experienced either.

Also this is remote work.  So it doesn't mean just relaxing in a cubicle.  It means we can go to movies on our lunch breaks.

Also I don't even include stock options in my salary, mainly because I work for a startup and it could end up being worth a lot if we IPO or worth nothing if we don't.  My GF who works for a Fortune 500 has much more predictable bonuses though.

"I have never had an issue with unlimited PTO.  The only time I have ever been denied was once when I tried to take 4 weeks at once and it ended up being during a month when a deadline was due. I still took 5 weeks that year.

You're right, that deductible is low compared to other healthcare plans I have been offered before.  However, saving $1k on a deductible isn't worth making $2k less/year. Heck, I'd argue on average it isn't worth making $1k less on average since you probably won't hit the deductible ever year.  I rarely spend more than $100/year in health related expenses.

Maxing out your accounts is pretty easy for a tech worker. If you aren't starting out over $100k, you probably can't pass the ""What's the difference between a Phillips and flat head"" equivalent tech interview questions.

"Unlimited PTO is awful. I worked one job with it and they took our buckets away and gave us that… and then every time you asked off the manager gave you the stink eye. Unlimited PTO Is a way for employers to reduce your leave invisibly through managerial pressure and not give them the bad press of not paying your PTO out when you leave. It’s a bad deal all around.

There are plenty of white collar jobs that only give you two weeks when starting and after years you may get to 4 if you’re lucky.

As far as your health plan stuff, you must be really lucky. Comparable plans at all my old employers were at least twice the cost, and here’s the important part, 5-10 times my deductible. My wife and I have health issues. Private health insurance has never been that great and are always stingy on claims from my experience.

If you easily max out your 401k and IRA accounts on top of an HSA… you’re not making the average person’s salary unless you’re living in your parents basement and have no expenses. You’re sort of talking from a high earner position here, I am not.

As far as the average pension benefit I’m on the high end of state pay so my 30 years of service credit will be a lot higher.

"I have never worked a job outside of high school that only had two weeks of PTO.  

For the last 5 years every job I took had unlimited PTO. 

I started a new job and plan on taking 5 weeks in the first year. How long did you have to work to get 5 weeks PTO?  According to [this](https://www.dhrm.virginia.gov/employeebenefits/paid-and-unpaid-leave) you have to work for almost 25 years to get around that level of PTO.

I have a comparable health plan at my company that would be about the same price. I choose the high deductible plan so I can sack away money in an HSA though. 

Also depends on what you are forgoing in pay to get that pension.  I easily max out all my retirement accounts and HSA, so I’m not worried about retirement. 

Though it looks like the average [pension benefit](https://www.nirsonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/virginia.pdf) isn’t even $20k/year, almost half your estimate.

"I have had 3 ACL knee operations - 2 on the left and 1 on the right. So I have spent A LOT of time in PT - with 3 different organizations. And I have shared that space with a variety of patients.

The best PT recommendation I can give is: you will make the most progress, the fastest progress, and the most lasting progress, if you religiously follow the instructions given AND DO THE WORK THEY PRESCRIBE OUTSIDE OF PT.

Most people go to PT 2-4 times a week for 60-90 minutes each time. The exercises and stretches you are to do at home will increase your rehabilitation time and effort by 1-2 hours a day.

Being in the PT gym, seeing the same patients week after week, it was very obvious which patients were only rehabbing at PT and not doing their at home work.

I get it. PT is not fun. IT HURTS most of the time. Your knee and leg will hurt MORE after you do your exercises.

Therefore, take your painkillers 30-45 minutes before your PT appointment - especially on days the therapist will be stretching your knee. Holy baby Jesus - those are some rough 10 minutes for the first couple of weeks.",t2_4rjr7,Pardon_my_baconess,0,1648991137.0,0,t1_i37w9uq,i37w9uq,True,[deleted],t3_tv8imw,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tv8imw/physical_therapy_recommendations_acl/,Physical Therapy recommendations?

"Around Pumphouse Park and The Carillon. Lots of hawks n woodpeckers. The cool red headed ones too, Peliated I think. Weekdays work best since less people. Just keep an eye out for bikers on the trail. Don't wanna cause a crash. 

Can get to the river as well around there and usually not many people. Herons, Turkey Vultures, and Black Vultures are usually around. 

Walking the railroad tracks too! The canal has loads of wildlife trying to avoid the people at the river. So lots of birds n deer stay around the canal when the trails are busy with people.

And of course Maymont. Go early and find a quiet spot or late afternoon. May not be as quiet but theres usually a good 2hrs in the morning before it gets too crowded. 

And my favorite is Hollywood Cemetery. Quiet, no large groups of people(sorta), and lots of birds around.

"Excellent answer.  One small correction: if you put in at the Pony Pasture ramp,  you're already below the z-dam, but if you put in at Huguenot, you'll have to deal with the z-dam.

To OP:  The z-dam just above  Pony Pasture has killed 20+ people over the years.  The portage path is on Williams Island, on the left side of the river as you're facing downstream.  There's also a small beach and shallows there, perfect for resting or eating some lunch before you continue on the float.  Plan on a several hour float from Pony Pasture to Reedy, and you'll need transportation back to PP, or have been dropped off there.  Walking back to the city is doable from Reedy via Belle Isle.",t2_juq61,lunar_unit,0,1648932418.0,0,t1_i35dxd8,i35dxd8,False,Agreeable-Shock7306,t3_tuqu68,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/tuqu68/floating_on_the_river/,Floating on the river?,/r/rva/comments/tuqu68/floating_on_the_river/i35dxd8/,47,r/rva,0,47

"I wouldn't take a pool float. Get a river tube. There are some minor rapids and you'll stay more firmy in place in a tube.

Water level is important. Around 5 ft at the [Westham Station](https://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=akq&gage=rmdv2) I think is considered ideal. Much higher and the rapids get more dangerous. Lower and your ass is more likely to hit.

Get in the river at [Pony Pasture](https://jamesriverpark.org/project/pony-pasture-rapids/) .

There is a point to port your float around the [Z-Dam](https://richmond.com/sports/local/where-am-i-rva-z-dam-on-the-james/article_3a398939-ae9b-5acc-ace3-330cf2937d40.html). Take the trail. The dam looks like nothing scary, but it kills. 

Get out either [Reedy Creek on the South bank or Texas Beach on the North Bank](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j26VqY16RWEJ1Sah7).

Do not go further downriver. After that is where the fall line starts and the real rapids get rough.

Also, we have a [combined sewer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_sewer). If there is heavy rain, we sometimes get a combined sewer overflow event, and raw sewage gets dumped into the river.

">I guess the logic is that as time goes on those newer “luxury” apartments get old and turn into mid-range affordable apartments

Yes, that's the logic.  It's really shit logic, but whatever.  Like you said, if you have luxury apartments generating money, then you will renovate rather than lower rent.  Look at some of the stuff getting built in Scott's Addition.  It's not really built to last.

The only real solution is to NOT build luxury housing.  Or build less.

There is essentially a shortage of housing of ALL kinds and at all income levels.  But most localities are scrambling to fill the luxury apartment segment.

Which means we can choose to just let every place around us fill the demand for luxury apartments while we fill a niche for middle class housing or some other segment.

The price we pay is that Richmond to some degree then becomes an inferior good.  We won't get the uber cool shit, and people won't move here for cool shit, they will move here because it's cheap.  Which is basically how Richmond worked up until maybe 2010.

Richmond is a place with tons of demand.  We do have to build *something*, or we are not tapping into the demand at all.  But we have more of a choice about which segments we choose to fill than people think.

But people keep letting the city waste hundreds of millions of dollars which means the city is going to really chase revenue, which means luxury apartments.  Young rich people spend lots of cash, and require very little from the city in return.  They don't even need schools.",t2_12plyx,ttd_76,0,1648925894.0,0,t1_i350hcq,i350hcq,False,johnjohnstevens,t3_ttgwm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/ttgwm2/rent_has_gotten_out_of_hand/,Rent has gotten out of hand,/r/rva/comments/ttgwm2/rent_has_gotten_out_of_hand/i350hcq/,0,r/rva,0,0

"Copied from original post. 


Ignore the date on Dashcam , this was today (04/01/22)

Background; My dad and I were driving, fast forward to this exit, where an angry Kia Forte comes to a stop. This was completely unprovoked , since we had not cut anyone off or At least there was no rational reason for them to act like that.

My dad is angered as is heard shouting at these idiots… I notice the driver has a gun hanging out the window, the passenger then sticks his head out and soon enough, his gun is aimed at my dad in the passenger seat. The driver soon does the same.

They keep going, we then meet them further down the ramp where they’re stopped. At this point, I have steered the car to the left ready to floor it across the grass and onto the oncoming opposite roadway as my escape plan, as seen they were planning to do something… they then take off and a car behind me is a police car. We pull over, he was of no help, since it’s state police’s matter, we wait for them.

">When Mines asked the Richmond Police to do something about the noise, she says they told her their hands were tied due to a new state law that restricted law enforcement’s ability to initiate traffic stops over equipment issues.

>Democratic lawmakers approved that change in 2020 as part of the post-George Floyd push for police reform, presenting it as a way to reduce racial disparities in traffic enforcement by preventing police from using minor vehicle defects as a reason to question or search drivers they believe to be suspicious.

So they made it illegal for police to make a traffic stop on a car for equipment issues because they felt it was racist. Then they changed their minds two years later on ONLY the loud exhaust code section. What a fucking joke. This is what the people wanted, I hope the police don't pull over any of these people until the entire 2020 ""police reform"" shit gets changed back to what it was. 

You can't pick and choose which code sections you want to enforce because ""some are racist but others aren't, and the ones we thought were racist are actually okay to stop people for because it's annoying and we were wrong. But it's still racist"".

"Someone’s choice of diet isn’t killing anyone. Abortion is not about ‘my body, my choice’ as is usually touted because once that baby is conceived, s/he has their own body and their own soul. To willingly take the life of your own baby is indisputably infanticide and familial infanticide, at that. Absolutely cold hearted and evil.

I don’t hate people for having abortions as they generally aren’t fully aware of the horrible choice they are making. I know many women regret their abortion(s) for the rest of their lives, and that speaks volumes.

I feel like abortion should be available in cases of rape, incest, and medical risk to the mother’s life, along with cases of diagnosed serious birth defects where the baby would not have a chance of survival whilst being in immense pain, such as anencephaly, for example. Unfortunately, that is an extremely low percentage of abortions and most are done for reasons such as maintaining one’s childless lifestyle, which is tragic. We also have women having multiple abortions, and I don’t mean two - I’m talking 6, 7, 8+. That’s using infanticide as birth control and that is absolutely wrong.

Edited to add: I know the ‘well adopt some kids then’ people will be just itching to reply to this, and while I don’t intend to adopt (although I am not opposed, who knows what the future may hold?), I do support and donate to organizations that give expecting moms considering abortion the financial, mental, medical, housing, etc. support they need to support their baby, so that they are able to raise that precious soul.",t2_ejcp7,2c-,0,1648918775.0,0,t1_i34kmw0,i34kmw0,False,choicebutts,t3_ttwcbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/ttwcbh/a_freedom_convoy_cruised_the_fan_on_harrison/,"A ""Freedom Convoy"" cruised the Fan on Harrison Street this morning",/r/rva/comments/ttwcbh/a_freedom_convoy_cruised_the_fan_on_harrison/i34kmw0/,1,r/rva,0,1

"You mentioned elsewhere that you have a child. As a woman, how would you have felt if the government forced you to have an abortion? Would you have felt like your agency was nonexistent, that your bodily autonomy was violated? I can’t speak for you, but I would imagine you would feel that way. Would you have done anything possible, including putting you’re own health and and safety at risk to birth your baby in secret? Once again I can’t speak for you, but probably. 

You can be anti-abortion, that’s a totally valid opinion and everyone is entitled to their own convictions. The difference between you and supporters of Roe v. Wade go much further than the surface issue of abortion though.

Supporters of Roe v. Wade do not want to force their conviction on anyone else. The option to birth is the default, natural state. They just want to ensure that people who don’t want to do that don’t have to.

Anti-abortion proponents want to mandate that others abide by their convictions. Why do you believe you have the right to enforce your conviction on to others? You can believe something is wrong without it being illegal. You don’t see the Amish out protesting against blood transfusions, they just don’t receive them. You don’t see Jews or Muslims protesting pork being sold in grocery stores and restaurants, or advocating for only kosher/halal products to be sold anywhere in the US. They just buy kosher/halal products and move on with life. You don’t see Hindus protesting the cattle industry, they just don’t buy beef. 

I have a question for you, and if you can’t answer I totally understand, I’m not trying to imply you believe this at all. I personally know a lot of people who are anti-abortion, as well as anti-vaccine. How can someone square that? Many times, the argument that comes back in response to what I takes about above is that abortion needs to be banned because the life of the child also needs to be considered, and that abortion is akin to murder, or infanticide I guess. Barring for a second that we have different words for regular murder and killing a baby less than a year old, how can someone who is pro life be anti-vax? Haven’t they already committed to the belief that the government has the right to enforce unwanted medical procedures on a non-consenting individual when it is required to protect the health of another, more vulnerable, individual?",t2_8fnnnrgk,cGxzeXVkZWMwZHRoaXMK,0,1648915219.0,0,t1_i34cica,i34cica,False,choicebutts,t3_ttwcbh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva/comments/ttwcbh/a_freedom_convoy_cruised_the_fan_on_harrison/,"A ""Freedom Convoy"" cruised the Fan on Harrison Street this morning",/r/rva/comments/ttwcbh/a_freedom_convoy_cruised_the_fan_on_harrison/i34cica/,3,r/rva,0,3

"I’m also pretty sure there’s a bit in the Bible about false idols, going so far as to include veneration of imagery along with deification of objects under the banner of idolatry. Going even further, worshiping symbols meant to represent God, instead of God himself is also considered idolatry, even if the worshiper didn’t intend it to replace God. I’m 100% positive that an American flag with crosses instead of stars is firmly in the idolatry camp.

That’s just talking about in the context of idolatry, I’m not anywhere near enough in the mood to start a whole conversation about Jesus’ teachings and the Scriptures stance on the role of religious leadership and the role of government. That’s even more nuanced a conversation and there’s no way it would be productive on Reddit with anyone, much less someone who says absolutely stupid shit like

"I haven't kept up with them here as much since several years ago I was like ""Thai food is one the easiest to make at home"" so it hurts to pay for it, instead of a cuisine that's more difficult to replicate.

I got 4 out of 5 spicy, which is usually a bit tough for me but I feel like I usually get a ""white boy 4"" served to me, so it's not hard. Paid Thai def. gave me ""born and raised Thai 4"", so it was hard to taste the food. It was good though.

Not gonna be that annoying person who is like ""make it yourself!"", but if you DO go that route, a good fish sauce is maybe the most important part. Get Red Boat, their ""40 degrees"" one, and you will not regret it.
