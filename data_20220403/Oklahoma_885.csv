"*The Rev. Serene Jones, whose hometown is Enid, Oklahoma, is president of Union Theological Seminary, a globally recognized graduate school of religion devoted to putting faith into practice for the common good.*

In the coming months, the Supreme Court likely will curtail or overturn Roe v. Wade — upending decades of precedent and dramatically limiting women’s right to choose. Conservative lawmakers nationwide already are beginning to pass harsh abortion bans that would be plainly unconstitutional under Roe — but might soon be perfectly legal in the post-Roe world. 

There’s no question that conservative religious beliefs are at the heart of this anti-abortion movement. Far-right politicians, pastors and organizations constantly invoke the word of God to justify controlling women’s bodies.

But here’s one of the tragic ironies of these anti-choice religious voices: The same voices arguing that a fertilized egg is a life that should be protected at all costs are actively opposed to providing even minimal protections for actual living, breathing children once they’ve been born — or to giving parents the paid leave, affordable health care or other support they need to raise healthy kids.   

In my well-worn Bible, I find references to “caring for others” on virtually every page. It’s a central tenet of the entire book. But abortion? I’m hard-pressed to find it mentioned anywhere, and those who claim otherwise have to contort the text. But listening to anti-choice voices, you’d think preventing abortion was the first above all other commandments, and that “love thy neighbor” was a trivial issue that can be tossed aside for party ideology. A maniacal focus on the fetus has corrupted their faith. 

One needn’t look hard to find their hypocrisy. Just look how some anti-choice Christians have rallied around Russian President Vladimir Putin in recent weeks — a man who has literally killed children in his quest to conquer Ukraine. At the Conservative Political Action Conference, Lauren Witzke — a GOP candidate for the Senate in Delaware who has previously decried abortion — said, “Russia is a Christian nationalist nation … I identify more with Putin’s Christian values than I do with Joe Biden.” Meanwhile, televangelist Pat Robertson — a longtime abortion opponent — recently stated that President Putin was “compelled by God” to invade Ukraine. 

Ukraine is just the latest illustration of this hypocrisy, but it’s far from the only one. Consider how purportedly ""pro-life"" policymakers have approached the COVID-19 pandemic — which has claimed the lives of nearly 1 million Americans. 

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, for example — a staunch anti-abortion advocate who consistently refers to his Christian faith in policymaking — is poised to sign an incredibly strict 15-week abortion ban. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, meanwhile, once proclaimed, “God our creator recognizes that life begins in the womb, and he knew every one of us before we were born ... We want to be No. 1 in protecting life in the U.S.” He has signed multiple bills restricting abortion.

And yet, both have allowed COVID-19 to spread like wildfire across their states — and have even proactively prevented constituents from taking steps to keep themselves safe. They have issued executive orders banning mask mandates and taken steps to block vaccine mandates. To date, more than 70,000 Floridians and 13,000 Oklahomans have died from COVID-19.

There was also a massive campaign from  anti-abortion lawmakers to kill the Build Back Better package — would provide parents with funding to support their children and would establish paid leave for caregivers — along with a host of other measures to allow future generations to thrive. 

The list goes on. The Family Research Council, a Christian-centric advocacy organization, is strongly  anti-abortion and yet has published content bashing masks and demonizing Obamacare, which has provided health care to tens of millions of people. The Heritage Foundation — which has strong religious ties — filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration for vaccine mandates and has repeatedly criticized the kind of paid leave that new parents would need as they recover from the physical and financial stresses of childbirth. 

What’s perhaps even more telling than what anti-abortion activists do say, is what they don’t say. They barely make a sound when immigrant children are separated from their parents and kept in cages. Or when Black children are killed by police officers. Or when poor children are evicted from their homes in the middle of a pandemic. Their silence screams volumes. 

As a theologian, I fully understand that people have different interpretations of when life begins. But here’s what shouldn’t be open to interpretation: God tells us to help the poor, sick and weary. 

It’s crucial that Christian leaders of principle speak up. That’s why, at Union Theological Seminary — which I lead — we hosted a summit on March 23 featuring prominent pro-choice Christian leaders. We explored how the “pro-life” movement is riddled with anti-life messages. 

Virtually every part of the Bible shows that we have a constant obligation to care for one another. By focusing on abortion and ignoring the very real struggles of living human beings, anti-abortion activists are not living up to the word of God. ",t2_4733o7lw,ginoenidok,0,1649012059.0,0,t1_i397u8d,i397u8d,True,ginoenidok,t3_tvgk9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tvgk9s/viewpoint_antiabortion_advocacy_in_oklahoma/,"Viewpoint: Anti-abortion advocacy in Oklahoma should center on real lives, not women's bodies",/r/oklahoma/comments/tvgk9s/viewpoint_antiabortion_advocacy_in_oklahoma/i397u8d/,1,r/oklahoma,0,1

"Lawmaker blames shift in power from commission to governor for 'questionable' spending

The commission serves in an advisory capacity since the state Legislature made changes to agency structures three years ago, giving the governor direct hiring and firing power over the tourism director. 

Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, blamed ""these questionable, perhaps non-defensible expenses"" in tourism on the changes made to the commission and the governor having more authority.

The commission's past authority ""is vested in the governor now,"" Kirt said on Thursday. 

Like the commissioners, Pinnell said he wanted to promote the renovations at state parks, which he said was a boost to the local economy.

""This is a very good example of an investment the state makes in rural Oklahoma,"" Pinnell said about the additions at Robbers Cave State Park. ""My plan is to continue to take the story of what you are doing inside the tourism department across the state and tell people this is one of the best tools we have in our toolbox.""",t2_4733o7lw,ginoenidok,0,1649010582.0,0,t1_i394cfz,i394cfz,False,ginoenidok,t3_tvg08p,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tvg08p/osbi_to_investigate_criminal_activity_between/,"OSBI to investigate criminal activity between state Tourism Department, Swadley's barbecue",/r/oklahoma/comments/tvg08p/osbi_to_investigate_criminal_activity_between/i394cfz/,1,r/oklahoma,0,1
"While the executive director of the state’s tourism department was defending his agency’s spending practices to an advisory commission Friday, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation confirmed it was opening an investigation.

Brook Arbeitman, public information officer for the OSBI, said the investigation comes at the request of Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, who is seeking an ""investigation (into) allegations of potential criminal conduct between the state of Oklahoma and Swadley's.""

Winchester, meanwhile, accused lawmakers behind a critical report of playing “armchair quarterback.”

“People don't have the perspective of what it used to be versus what it is now,” said Jerry Winchester, executive director of the Oklahoma Tourism and Recreation Department, defending the agency’s use of millions of dollars to renovate state park lodges and restaurants.

On Thursday, Winchester was before the Legislative Office of Fiscal Transparency, also called LOFT, a bipartisan committee of state lawmakers that was presented a report that claimed the tourism department improperly valued assets, signed a questionable contract with a restaurant operator and questioned the amount the agency was requesting in next year's budget for maintenance costs. 

On Friday, Winchester discussed the report with the Tourism and Recreation Advisory Committee, which met at Robbers Cave State Park inside a recently renovated restaurant. 

Winchester said the lodges at state parks were in disrepair and needed significant investment to attract guests. He also said remodeling restaurants was necessary to improve the food and service.

Report questions why only one company submitted bid to operate park restaurants 

The LOFT report showed that the tourism department spent more than half of $48 million in bonds on renovating restaurants and lodges, which the Legislature approved. The tourism department has since requested an additional $19.3 million for maintenance. 

The LOFT report was also critical of the department's contract with Swadley's to manage the new state park restaurants. Lawmakers questioned why the restaurant was the only one to submit a bid given the fact that the state was promising to cover any losses. 

Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell, who serves as Gov. Kevin Stitt's secretary of tourism, wildlife and heritage, was also at Friday's commission meeting and said he was “proud” of the direction tourism was going, but expected to recommend some changes to the governor in light of the LOFT report, which he got to review a couple of weeks ago. 

“I want to make sure we are spending taxpayer dollars wisely here and Oklahomans get a good return on that investment,” Pinnell said. 

Pinnell also said he supports changing the tourism commission to give it more oversight of the department. 

“I would support making the tourism commission more than an advisory role only,” Pinnell told The Oklahoman. “I want there to be oversight and teeth, so to speak.”

Tourism director says restaurants, lodges were in danger of closing

Winchester told the tourism commission that it was to be expected that the state would lose money on state park restaurants, but that its losses had decreased.  

If renovations weren't made then lodges and restaurants would have to be closed, Winchester said. 

""As much trouble as we had talking about shutting down a golf course, I can only imagine (if we tried to shut down lodges),"" Winchester said. 

Tourism commissioners were largely supportive of Winchester and defended the agency. 

Michelle Finch, one of the commission members, urged the department to increase its promotion of the remodeled park facilities. 

“You have to tell people (about the improvements), because if you don't, you are going to find yourself in LOFT, whatever that is,” Finch told Winchester during Friday's meeting. “I know you are battling some stuff and it seems very unfair.”",t2_4733o7lw,ginoenidok,0,1649010543.0,0,t1_i3948x8,i3948x8,True,ginoenidok,t3_tvg08p,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tvg08p/osbi_to_investigate_criminal_activity_between/,"OSBI to investigate criminal activity between state Tourism Department, Swadley's barbecue",/r/oklahoma/comments/tvg08p/osbi_to_investigate_criminal_activity_between/i3948x8/,1,r/oklahoma,0,1

Yes you are. Any discussion about reservations in Oklahoma is a discussion about McGirt. You want to deny that because it counters your entire claim but that's not how civil discussions work. 

You keep going on about something you clearly know nothing about and plug your ears to all the evidence in the world that you're wrong. 

It doesn't matter that you've been called something wrongly in the past. Look up Cherokee Nation laws and see how they define ""at large."" It has nothing to do with if you live on a reservation or not.

"For directions, type in “Great Salt Plains Selenite Digging Area” into the maps on your phone.    

Things to know: - Free admission- There are NO restrooms at the site (there are in the adjoining state park)- 

There is next to nothing in Jet, OK for facilities – plan your route through Enid. - From US 64, you will travel on a dirt road on a county road. To get to the site, you will finish on a gravel road.  

Things to take: - Sunscreen - Water to drink - Water to wash hands - Rags/old towel - Regular-sized shovel - to dig a big hole (if desired) - Garden hand shovel- Screwdriver – to aid in carefully moving dirt around a crystal - Sunglasses – the entire area is bright as snow - Pieces of cardboard to sit upon - A folding chair to sit in when you get tired sitting on the ground - Some people bring a wagon for the little kids - Container (with lid) to put the crystals that you find. - Container to put garden tools, etc. in for carrying to/from dig site. (we used a 5 gallon bucket) - Plastic bag to cover the big shovel to and from your house - Wet wipes may not be a bad idea  

 Finding a location to dig: The crystals will be brown from the soil. You can clean them when you get them home.   One method (I found on a website): - Use a shovel to dig a hole about two feet deep and two feet across until you reach wet sand ... - Allow two or three inches of water to seep in from the bottom. - Use your hand or a container to splash water gently against the sides of the hole ... - When you find a crystal formation, continue splashing to wash it free of the supporting sand and clay. - At this stage of the process, the newly exposed crystals are wet and fragile so use great care removing them.   We  
 started digging a deep hole, but abandoned that   
effort before very long. With all of the recent rain, we found crystals,  
 around holes, that others had dug. The holes, that others had dug, were  
 at least several days old. Look through the dirt piled around such   
holes. I found a number of crystals, in the dirt piles, next to   
previously-dug holes.   Shallow digging with the hand shovel   
netted a bunch of crystals for my wife. I found a lot of mine by walking  
 around and getting bigger ones that were just under the surface.   NOTE: Place your phone where it will not fall out into a wet hole. Remove wedding ring, watch, etc, if doing the deep hole.   When finished, use water to rinse your hands. Rub hand together. Pour more water on hands, then dry.   Be careful walking to and from your dig site. There are holes and uneven terrain that can cause you to fall. We stayed for several hours and found a number of crystals.",t2_gfcv3he0,alpharamx,0,1648954392.0,0,t1_i36fgfl,i36fgfl,True,XXXXXzaneXXXXX,t3_tumh0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tumh0w/crystal_digging_at_the_salt_plains/,Crystal Digging at the Salt Plains,/r/oklahoma/comments/tumh0w/crystal_digging_at_the_salt_plains/i36fgfl/,1,r/oklahoma,0,1

"I'm going to respond to why the ""Michael Phelps"" arguemnt is not the same.  We have selected categories in sport, and certain sports select for certain body types.  We have sports that are BASED on that premise.  It is accepted.  Just like the sport of basketball selects for tall people, both female and males.  Tall people tend to be better at basketball than short people.  We do not give short people stilts, and say here, since you are short, we're going to level the playing field and give you an advantage because everyone else is taller than you.  We have decided that in most sports, we do not DIRECTLY insert our selves and caterogize based on those type of genetic advantages.  Now, in a sport like boxing or wrestling, we HAVE directly inserted into the rules weight categories.  Because we can clearly see, that people who weigh more than someone else have an advantage in those sports.  So we have created categories in the sports for different weight classes.  We have not created cateogies in swiming for height diffferences. Therefore it is a terrible arguement.  

The issue isn't just about testosterone or other hormones and reducing them in cis males when they transition to a transwomen.  Lets go back to basketball.  Men are generally taller than women.  Again, basketball selects for tall people.  Look at the average heights of the best men players in the NBA, and the average heights of the best women players in the NBA.  You will see there is probably a 3-5inch difference in height on average.  Take any of those cis male nba players, allow them to transition, and put them on whatever hormone therapy you want.  None of those hormone therapys are going to reduce their height. In the sport of basketball, the cis male height is the advantage. This is how every sport needs to be looked at.  Its not just about testosterone. Its about how the cis male body is able to utlize testosterone more when the body goes through puberty, and that confers  advantages in sport over cis women.",t2_asoly,trxc,1,1648928541.0,0,t1_i355qes,i355qes,False,lurker627,t3_tuiilz,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tuiilz/first_openly_nonbinary_rep_responds_to_oklahomas/,"First openly nonbinary rep. responds to Oklahoma’s trans athlete ban, says conservative legislators ‘capitalize on a fabricated fear’",/r/oklahoma/comments/tuiilz/first_openly_nonbinary_rep_responds_to_oklahomas/i355qes/,1,r/oklahoma,0,1

"I think about it this way: Michael Phelps has long limbs, and extra webbing on his feet on we don't say he has an unfair advantage. I understand that's it's not necessarily equivalent, but it is hypocritical.

Either we critique all ""unfair"" advantages and accommodate for those or we do none at all. I feel it is safe to assume cisgendered women are born with certain advantages also.

Also, you make a very level headed and reasonable point. This is completely new territory for us as a society and I believe that the inclusion of transgendered athletes can be improved. NCAA guidelines say that a trans women must be on hormone replacement therapy for a year. Maybe that should be longer? I don't really know, and I think a whole lot of people don't know.

There are certain hard-nose critiques on each side that spew hate, and vitriol that add nothing of substance to this debate that is going to last for YEARS. It's counter productive and regresses our society. That's my biggest issue, and I do not agree with this bill because I believe it comes from a place of hate for trans people.

"I’ve been there many times. Hardly ever crowded.

Pro Tips:

Take sunglasses and sunblock. The sun magnified off all that white is blinding.

Take a small hand trowel and several gallon jugs of water.

Dig a small bowl shaped hole then put the trowel to the side.

Pour the water slowly around the edge of the hole and the crystals will wash into the “bowl”.

Selenite crystal is very delicate and easy to dig.

You may want to take a roll of tissue paper and a few flat boxes to wrap and carry the crystals in. You don’t want to stack a bunch on top of each other or they will break.

"Though fewer than 50% of Oklahoma voters believe the state is on the right track, Gov. Kevin Stitt appears positioned to win a second term, according to a new poll offering a glimpse of high-profile political races two weeks before candidate filing.

The poll, by Amber Integrated of Oklahoma City, shows Stitt’s approval among likely general election voters is 47%, while the same share of voters believes Oklahoma is going in the right direction.

Likely Republican voters have a much better view of the governor and nearly 60% plan to vote for him or lean toward voting for him over Republican Mark Sherwood, according to the poll. In a potential general election match-up, Stitt leads state School Superintendent Joy Hofmeister by 14 percentage points, 44% to 30%.

For the past several weeks, Stitt has been the subject of [a barrage of negative ads](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2022/03/27/gov-kevin-stitt-face-new-attacks-over-commutation-decisions/7155607001/) funded by dark money organizations that don’t reveal their donors.

Pollster Jackson Lisle, a partner in Amber Integrated, said the new poll numbers were a good sign for Stitt's reelection chances and that the deep unpopularity of President Joe Biden, a Democrat, was also an advantage.

“It is hard for any Democrat to win when their party leader has a 28% job approval rate,” Lisle said, noting Biden’s job approval among Oklahoma voters in the new poll.

Stitt, 49, was a political newcomer in 2018 [when he beat Democrat Drew Edmondson by 12 points](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/politics/state/2018/11/07/kevin-stitt-wins-governors-race/60490304007/). Republican voter registration in Oklahoma has risen since then. In January, according to the Oklahoma Election Board, there were 1,122,582 registered Republicans; 696,723 registered Democrats; 381,088 independents and 17,981 Libertarians.

Lisle cautioned Thursday that the field of candidates in all races could change before filing on April 13-15.

“We could see new candidates emerge before filing and we could see candidates drop out of the race,” Lisle said. “The candidates listed in our survey are the candidates who have announced their intentions to run for that particular office.”

Gentner Drummond preferred in Oklahoma attorney general's race
Stitt’s handpicked attorney general, John O’Connor, is trailing Republican Gentner Drummond among likely GOP primary voters, garnering just 11% support to Drummond’s 31%.

Lisle noted that Drummond, a Tulsa attorney, has been on the ballot before — he nearly ousted former Attorney General Mike Hunter in the 2018 GOP primary — and has been running ads.

“Still, nearly half of all likely primary voters remain undecided in this race,” he said.

[Stitt appointed O’Connor](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/2021/07/23/gov-kevin-stitt-john-oconnor-oklahoma-attorney-general-running-2022/8067178002/), of Tulsa, to the post after Hunter resigned last year.

The survey of 455 likely GOP primary voters was conducted from March 24-27 and has a margin of error of 4.6%. The survey of likely general election voters was conducted from March 24-27 and included 500 likely general election voters and has a margin of error of 4.4%.

Lankford lapping Lahmeyer; Mullin early leader in other Senate race
The GOP primary poll shows U.S. Sen. James Lankford has a commanding lead over challenger Jackson Lahmeyer, a Tulsa pastor who has made overturning the 2020 presidential election a centerpiece of his campaign. Lankford, who has been running reelection ads and [recently said he would not debate Lahmeyer](https://www.oklahoman.com/story/news/local/oklahoma-city/2022/03/19/lankford-says-he-wont-give-lahmeyer-free-air-time-debate/7090573001/), leads 55% to 8%, according to the poll.

In the GOP race to replace longtime U.S. Sen. Jim Inhofe, U.S. Rep. Markwayne Mullin has the early lead, with 35%, while former Oklahoma House Speaker T.W. Shannon has 11% and state Sen. Nathan Dahm has 5%. The undecided in that race is 38%.

Republican candidates in Oklahoma have sought to align themselves with Trump, and Lahmeyer has been pushing hard for an endorsement from the former president. Trump has endorsed Stitt for reelection; it’s not clear whether he will get involved in any of the contested primaries.

Lisle said, “Trump's favorability sits at nearly 80% positive among GOP primary voters. The former president clearly still has a massive influence within the party. A Trump endorsement could heavily impact any of these races.”",t2_br4uk,lurker627,0,1648905113.0,0,t1_i33rp06,i33rp06,True,lurker627,t3_tuijy0,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/tuijy0/new_poll_shows_kevin_stitt_james_lankford_leading/,"New poll shows Kevin Stitt, James Lankford leading, John O'Connor losing",/r/oklahoma/comments/tuijy0/new_poll_shows_kevin_stitt_james_lankford_leading/i33rp06/,7,r/oklahoma,0,7

"Parked on private property?

Yes = they can make their own parking rules, especially if posted on a claim check. I understand their logic I guess, but have never heard of a similar situation ever.

No = they've got nothing. You paid to park in a public space owned by the taxpayers.

Regardless, this whole thing is dumb. Is there more to the story perhaps? It's not that I doubt you at all. I'm just trying to see why they are after you like this. 

If they are a private company, they'd have to sue you in order to collect. This seems unlikely, but so does the damn 'ticket' in the first place.

Which again I ask if this is private, how do they even find you? License plate?

The Arts district is always crowded -FYI. In that sense, I get why they want to bring in as many paying customers as possible.

My guess:

This is private.

You paid. 

You can park where you want. 

They're angry, because they lost a non-placard holder customer to a placard holder space that was empty, but wouldn't have been if you were in it.

Words were spoken. Feelings bruised. Now they're just after you on principle.

The disabled parking statute requiring a certain number of placard spaces doesn't work in reverse. It only requires they offer the placard spaces to those with the placard. It doesn't forbid the non-placard space restrictions if placard space available as your legal right to the placard space was in no way denied.

So long as that's honored, private company or perhaps even municipality, etc. could make this kind of restriction. It's legal as it doesn't violate placard holder statute and simply requires if available, it must be used.

It's dumb, but again there's still a missing piece here. Never have I ever heard of something like this.

"It was when I was traveling frequently and we were looking for somewhere to live, that wasn't here. Our flight was cancelled and we ended up staying the weekend in OKC and getting great service, while having a blast, for pretty inexpensive,  and with not too many people. I would go to Chicago, or Vegas or Nashville or Colorado (where I love) or California (where I am from) and would compare them to how great our weekend was in OKC. 

I was spending a lot of time in the Wichita's and looking for new hikong locations, and when I should have been exhausted after hours of hiking, I always felt rejuvenated. I also loved going to the festivals in Medicine Park and the entire area grounded me. When things were bad and my health took a turn, I would sit out there and look at these rocks, that they say are 525 million years old and my problems became so insignificant, if they could survive that long, I could make my 100 or so, the best I can. 

That thought led me to the people of Oklahoma and how strong the people from here are. No matter who their ancestors were, if a person's roots were here, their family had experienced hard times and had survived. The people from here are strong, with deep, scared, battered and beautiful roots. 

Then 2020 happened and I was traveling in the beginning and the chaos just overwhelmed me. Once I was home, I was home for 4 months straight, I went nowhere and I realized how content I am in my home and how grateful I am for our yard  and I would sit and watch the bluejays and robins and cardinals come in and feel so much peace, even though people back home were describing a much different experience. 

Of course I had to start traveling again and every time I longed to come home because everywhere I went felt different,  some completely open, some completely closed and some with a weird mixture of both, but all felt chaotic and I wanted my peace back. Of course I see the beauty in everywhere I go but it wasn't my peace. So I gave that  up, and took an at home job.

My kids have homes here and I have cousins who are still living at home. So I know at least in that aspect it's easier here for them, here. But, coming from a state that greatly supplemented my education, because I was a foster kid, I do understand how important social programs and community support are. Who would I be if I had not had that help? I do see some progress though, so I am hopeful. 

I do acknowledge that there are faults and the state government does the people of Oklahoma no justice. I also don't understand how people like Stitt refuse to honor the Native roots that are Oklahoma. But I love it enough to do what I can, to prepare myself and fight for the people here, especially the kids. I don't understand people who loved their children so fiercely, not wanting to invest in the youth of OK, it doesn't equate. But I have hope there too. 

I also acknowledge that I am speaking from a place of privilege, but I believe this state is on the precipice and I really believe we're going to come out on top. I believe our youth will make sure of it. 

So yeah, I love it here and I will fight for it to be a place that my grandkids will be proud to be born and bred  Oklahoman's.",t2_8zqqe684,Difficult-Lychee-782,0,1648861269.0,0,t1_i3205wu,i3205wu,False,SpicyBatch93,t3_ttnn9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/ttnn9u/okies_who_have_moved_out_of_ok_hows_it_going/,"Okies who have moved OUT of OK, how’s it going?",/r/oklahoma/comments/ttnn9u/okies_who_have_moved_out_of_ok_hows_it_going/i3205wu/,6,r/oklahoma,0,6

"Gov. Kevin Stitt's latest nominee to the board that oversees the state higher education system is a successful businessman but has no college degree.

Dustin Hilliary, managing partner of Lawton's Hilliary Communications, said in an email that he attended Cameron University ""for nearly three years until the growth of my family’s business put me neck deep in the family business quicker than we anticipated.""

Since then, Hilliary said, ""I have been a part of increasing our footprint, to include growing the company into Texas and Iowa, and creating more than a hundred jobs in rural Oklahoma.""

Hilliary said that experience gives him insight into higher education.

""We are in a new era for higher education where we must ensure it is attractive and accessible to a wide range of people, from those graduating high school to those finishing a military deployment overseas to adults who need to retool and retrain,"" he said.

""I am confident my life experiences will bring perspective to a very impressive Board of Regents. (I) will work hard to ensure Oklahoma is delivering a quality public education system that serves all people, no matter their life situations or circumstances.""

Stitt nominated Hilliary on Friday to replace Tulsan Jay Helm, whose term expires next month. For decades, the position has been been held by someone from Tulsa, but a spokesman for Stitt indicated that that was not a factor in his decision.

""The governor is always looking for the best candidates,"" said Charlie Hannema.

Tulsa is still represented on the board by businessman Jody Parker.

Giving someone without a college degree oversight of the state's colleges and universities might raise some eyebrows but fits with Stitt's history of appointing people to boards and agencies based mostly on their business background.

“I believe that our higher education system exists to train and prepare Oklahoma’s workforce. Dustin Hilliary’s extensive business experience, especially in rural communities, will help ensure our colleges and universities are producing graduates with the skills that Oklahoma companies need,” Stitt said in a press release.

Hannema pointed to that comment when asked about Stitt's decision to invite criticism by appointing someone without a college degree to the board of the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education.

The press release also includes an endorsement from Cameron University President John McArthur, who said Hilliary ""and his corporate family have been great partners"" to CU and higher education.

Hilliary Communications provides telephone and broadband services to 19,000 customers in 22 counties in southwestern Oklahoma and northwestern Texas. It also publishes two newspapers, the Comanche County Chronicle in Elgin and the Lawton-based Southwest Ledger, which lists Dustin Hilliary as co-publisher.

According to the governor's press release, Hilliary Communications has been awarded more than $110 million in federal broadband loans and grants from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Federal Communications Commission.

Dustin Hilliary's professional associations include NTCA — the Rural Broadband Association, Oklahoma Farm Bureau, Oklahoma Cattleman’s Association, Oklahoma Telephone Association, Elgin Schools Education Foundation, Comanche County Memorial Hospital Foundation and the Oklahoma State Chamber.

Politically, Oklahoma State Ethics Commission data indicate that the extended Hilliary family and Hilliary Communications have contributed at least $325,000 to candidates — most but not all Republicans — for state office and state political action committees since 2015.

Included in that total is $13,100 to Stitt's 2022 reelection campaign.

The Federal Election Commission lists $142,300 in contributions from Dustin Hilliary since 2008. U.S. Sen. James Lankford and U.S. Reps. Tom Cole, Stephanie Bice and Markwayne Mullin have each received in excess of $20,000 from Hilliary.

https://modernize.com/homeowner-resources/other/220-volt-electrical-outlets

That's probably going to be standard for that amount of work.  Do you already have a 220 plug anywhere near where you park your car?  If so, you could possibly get a 220V extension cord used by RVs and just run an extension cord to your charger.  Those are only 20-30 feet long however so you'd need a relatively close existing outlet. (\*edit: Just realized you needed 125A so that might not work with your existing vehicle charger...220 outlets are usually only 20-30A unless they were overbuilt on purpose)

You may find someone that will give you a little better rate, but if you could have that job done for less than $2500 by a licensed electrician, I'd be completely surprised.  I did DIY because my install was going to be $1500 back in 2015 and I didn't even have to replace a panel.  My charger wasn't 125A.

"Well first off, morale is so low among educators nationwide so my comment will be biased no matter how I try to word it. 

Our school, and many other schools across the state, actually have plenty of money this year from Covid relief funds and are using those funds to hire educators and admin in unsustainable roles. When those funds run out, there will undoubtedly be reductions in force and many of us are very nervous about that. 

That, of course, is pure speculation. 

Facts-wise, Gov. Stitt has pushed an intense private school agenda during his time in office. He has taken school choice (a concept with which I generally agree, and take advantage of for my own child) and turned it on its head to mean that students have the right to attend any school at the taxpayers' expense, even private schools. The overwhelming majority of private schools in this state are religiously affiliated (77%!) and exist in urban areas. Stitt wants parents to be able to take their child's public school funding and transfer it into a voucher for private schools, which could be disastrous for certain public schools and has no positive impact on students that live in an area without private schools (most of our rural students). Private schools in Oklahoma have less than 25% minority enrollment, versus the Oklahoma public school average of right about 50% (obviously this varies widely - my school district is well over 60% minority students). The inequities of private school vouchers being taxpayer-funded continue, but thankfully our state Senate voted down the bill.

"Lurker, but this question applies to me so I wanna answer. I’m thinking about coming back after I graduate, but I’ve spent the past four years in NYC almost full time for undergrad, and right now I’m in Ireland getting my master’s degree. I won’t lie, and I’m guessing most people on this sub will say the opposite, but God I’ve been SO homesick. 

I’ve lived in one town my whole life, I grew up participating in community events—life outside the metro is so weird to me. The dirt in Ireland is ash gray brown, and there are fewer wildflowers, so, even when it’s sunny outside and the grass is green, the world literally looks less colorful.

"The “school friendly” version is “Why do many of your policies seem to contradict each other. For example, childrens lives before they are born are considered ‘sacred’ and are valued over the health of the mother, but as soon as they are born there is little support. If they are given up for adoption, the system is broken and they often times get put in terrible households or are bounced around for the rest of their childhood. You keep voting to defund educational institutions and putting laws in place that limit teachers ability to teach, putting more work and stress on the teachers who already have a difficult job. Children obviously don’t matter that much to you, so why do you say that unborn babies are so important and then when they are born immediately disregard them”

"See, you moved the goalpost here. 
You went from ""any restriction"" to this new line in the sand. 

You can rationalize your restrictions all you want, and excuse why yours are ok but others are not... but when you were first asked about what it means to support the 2a you clearly defined what it meant. 

You are ok with 2a rights being infringed/limited, you just disagree with where the line is drawn whiles still saying that any call for infringement is not support for the 2a.

So we have the problem that you consider yourself a supporter of the 2a and claim that it is an indicator of people wanting to be left alone, but when you defined it you can't consider yourself a 2a supporter.

We haven't even got into any of the other tricky questions (who gets nukes, thermite, tiny drones with explosives?) about the 2a before we start seeing this backpeddling. You may feel your infringements are justified, but it is still backpeddling from your initial position. 

When we talk about people who want freedom etc, I see a lot of arguments similar to yours. 

""This group supports the 2a and therefore that is a good indicator for them wanting to be left alone (or whatever euphemism for freedom is being used). Support means no infringements.""

""So support means they don't want any infringements? What about these ones you clearly support? Let's look at things other than the 2a, what about this laundry list of things that this group supports? Why do we use this metric that you don't even agree with compared to some pretty cut and dried stuff?""

We can get even deeper into the weeds and ask if removing all infringements for the 2a would make as big of an impact as.. say.. allowing people to marry who they want?

"Having worked in higher Ed for years, I can say yes funding can be a problem in higher Ed, but the biggest issue is terrible leadership.  I'll try to find the article about OU-Norman that outlines some of the more egregious problems Boren allowed at OU before he left.  So basically when you combine the state not providing proper funding levels with university leadership not being able to make reasonable financial decisions you end up with the pathetic state that our higher Ed system is in.

For K-12 I feel that the legislature needs to just increase funding.  There are already multiple systems in place to track the schools performance and maintain accountability over administrators.  For higher Ed they need to develop these systems so that stake holders have a say in whether the leadership is meeting expectations.  The current board of regents concept is failing in that regard.  Even something as simple as allowing stake holders to hold a symbolic vote of confidence to voice their opinion of how a higher Ed institution is being led, would be an improvement.

Edit: these weren't what I was looking for, but they do highlight some of the problems that out current system of leadership by political appointment has led to.  I do get that a university president is more of a political position that administrative, but they still need leaders who are effective administrators.

"From Tulsa to Houston and now back to Tulsa.

Oklahoma has lower cost of living, isn't as humid, property taxes are less.

I lived in Houston for a couple years and wouldn't go back. Traffic was awful, humidity was awful, cost of living was higher, property taxes were insane. However there was more to do, more concerts, more sporting events, more restaurants, the ocean was an hour away..... But if I were to go back to TX I'd go to San Antonio or Austin.

Overall, Oklahoma isn't too bad. People here shit on it but it's probably because they have never lived anywhere else, every place has its problems and every place that has a sub you can go to it and you'll see the people who live there shitting on it. 

Saddest part of living in Oklahoma is the number of people in poverty who keep voting to keep themselves in poverty because they're loyal to a political ideology that keeps them at an economic disadvantage.

"> because of the McGirt decision.

This isn't ""because of the McGirt decision."" This is because Oklahoma was improperly trying people for crimes when they didn't have jurisdiction. McGirt was simply the case that brought Oklahoma's problems to light. Had Oklahoma been doing what they should have, this never would have happened. 

>married to a Cherokee woman and all for respecting tribal sovereignty. But

By the way ""I can't be racist, I have a black friend"" is the most stereotypical thing a racist can say.

> I think most of this is posturing, and a proxy for the real fight between the state and the tribes, which is about casino money

Sounds like you're not too good at thinking. The casino money issue was decided well before McGirt. 

>And I think we are doing ourselves as Oklahomans a disservice if we fail to acknowledge the problems from the McGirt decision

There are no problems with ""the McGirt decision"" there's problems from doing shit wrong for a hundred years prior to the McGirt decision, but saying it like that doesn't frame it in a way as to take away the Supreme Court ruling that helped brown people, so I can guess why you prefer to frame it as ""problems with McGirt.""",t2_4h522nit,AccordLands,0,1648819209.0,0,t1_i2zah6q,i2zah6q,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_ttcgqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/ttcgqf/oklahoma_gov_stitts_appearance_on_fox_news_draws/,"Oklahoma Gov.

"Lived in Philly for a few years, and there were noticeable sociopolitical differences with their own pros and cons. A lot of people in Oklahoma tend to focus on the things they feel they lose in this situation, but I would argue that the benefits generally tended to outweigh.

Cities on the east coast do tend to be built differently, literally, between the higher population density and the longer history prior to the existence/popularization of cars. Cramped streets with restrictive parking are balanced by walkable neighborhoods supported by public transit, to the point that I basically never used my car.

High cost of living and taxes (the areas in which everyone claims Oklahoma is better than most places) are offset by larger, more vibrant economies that are more likely to pay a livable wage and support public services (like transit). It's anecdotal, sure, but I know that I was doing better financially at basically the same job I was doing in Oklahoma, despite my rent almost doubling and a much bigger portion of my paycheck going to state/local taxes.

Moved back to Oklahoma because, like it or not, this state is my home, and has been my family's home since before it even *was* a state.

"Fort Sill has always had a runway (arguably two), and sometime after 2000 they discovered that one of the runways was built over a graveyard (Comanche or Apache I believe) in the 1940s (I believe), thus by law they had to shut it down.  Also by law, they are not allowed to do any improvements to it to make it look like a graveyard (Ironically).   If this Google maps aerial is of a new runway, it might be to replace the one that has been shut down.  The runway was over by the old Zeppelin hangar (cool building in of itself).  If you visit, make sure you go to the Comanche and Apache graveyards on the other side of the post where Geronimo is buried.   Lots of history there.

\*Edit:  The other runways are on post closer to the highway and the city of Lawton (and for smaller planes) - this runway is a significant distance from the main post and is a very long runway.

"Calling tails on a coin flip using some future U.S. quarters could reveal an Osage dancer from Oklahoma known as ""America's first prima ballerina."" 

Maria Tallchief — the most famous of the ""Five Moons,"" five Native American dancers from Oklahoma who took the international ballet world by storm in the 20th century — will be one of the five 2023 honorees of the American Women Quarters Program, the U.S. Mint announced.  

""Featuring Maria on the quarter will elevate our collective memory about her unprecedented contributions to dance,"" said Russ Tallchief, Maria Tallchief's nephew, an Oklahoma City-based writer, dancer and educator.

""It is easy to forget over time that Maria reached the highest echelon in ballet at a time when women of color were still struggling for career opportunities that allowed them to reach their greatest potential."" 

What groundbreaking women will be featured on the 2023 quarters?  

Along with Tallchief, the groundbreaking women to be featured on 2023 quarters are: 

Bessie Coleman, the first African American and first Native American woman pilot  

Jovita Idár, a Mexican American journalist, activist, teacher and suffragist

Edith Kanakaʻole, an Indigenous Hawaiian composer, chanter, dancer and teacher 

Eleanor Roosevelt, the first lady who became the first chair of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights as well as chairwoman of the Human Rights Commission, where she oversaw the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 

“The range of accomplishments and experiences of these extraordinary women speak to the contributions women have always made in the history of our country,” said U.S. Mint Deputy Director Ventris C. Gibson in a statement.

What other Oklahoma women will be honored on a quarter?  

Tallchief will be the second Native American woman from Oklahoma honored on a U.S. quarter. 

Last year, Wilma Mankiller, the Cherokee Nation's first principal woman chief, was part of the first group of honorees announced for the American Women Quarters Program.  

As authorized by the Circulating Collectible Coin Redesign Act of 2020, the program will release five new designs honoring women trailblazers each year between 2022 and 2025. So far this year, the U.S. Mint has begun shipping new quarters featuring African American poet, author and civil rights activist Maya Angelou and astronaut Sally Ride.  

Due to be released later this year are quarters spotlighting Mankiller; Adelina ""Nina"" Otero-Warren, a leader of New Mexico's suffrage movement; and Anna May Wong, the first Asian American female movie star.

 As required by law, no living person will be featured in the coin designs, so all the women to be honored must be deceased. 

The quarters depict the women trailblazers on the reverse, or tails, side. The obverse, or heads, side features a portrait of George Washington originally composed and sculpted by Laura Gardin Fraser to mark the first U.S. president's 200th birthday.   

Who was Maria Tallchief?  

Born in Fairfax in 1925, Elizabeth Maria Tallchief — known to her family as Betty Marie — got her start dancing at her father’s movie theater with her sister, Marjorie, in their hometown. From there, she performed all over the world, raised the profile of American ballet on the international stage and helped popularize ballet in the United States.  

Her family moved to California when she was 8, and after high school, Tallchief traveled to New York and started as an apprentice with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. 

In 1944, famed Russian choreographer George Balanchine joined Ballet Russe, and he and Tallchief married in 1946. Their marriage ended in 1951, but they proved successful collaborators: In 1947, after becoming the first American to dance with the Paris Opera Ballet, Tallchief was named the first prima ballerina of what would evolve into the New York City Ballet.  

Balanchine choreographed leading parts for her in several ballets, including ""Swan Lake,"" ""The Nutcracker"" and ""The Firebird."" 

Tallchief retired from the stage in 1966 and settled in Chicago, where she directed Chicago's Lyric Opera Ballet from 1973 to 1979 and the Chicago City Ballet from 1980 to 1987. 

Before she died in 2013 at the age of 88, Tallchief was given the name ""Wa-Xthe-Thonba,"" or ""Woman of Two Standards,"" by the Osage Nation, became the first Oklahoma native lauded at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1996 and received a National Medal of Arts in 1999.  

Tallchief and the other Five Moons — her sister, Marjorie Tallchief (Osage), Yvonne Chouteau (Shawnee and Cherokee), Moscelyne Larkin (Shawnee-Peoria) and Rosella Hightower (Choctaw) — were named Oklahoma Cultural Treasures in 1997. 

They are immortalized in Chickasaw painter Mike Larsen's mural ""Flight of Spirit"" in the state Capitol rotunda.  

""Each time we hold that quarter in our hands, we will be reminded that women like Maria and all of the five Native ballerinas paved roads untraveled by Native and American women in dance. I can't wait to hold that history in my hand,"" Russ Tallchief told The Oklahoman. ",t2_4733o7lw,ginoenidok,0,1648792943.0,0,t1_i2y8uqz,i2y8uqz,True,ginoenidok,t3_ttjpg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/oklahoma/comments/ttjpg5/us_quarters_will_soon_spotlight_trailblazing/,"U.S. quarters will soon spotlight trailblazing Native dancer from Oklahoma, Maria Tallchief",/r/oklahoma/comments/ttjpg5/us_quarters_will_soon_spotlight_trailblazing/i2y8uqz/,5,r/oklahoma,0,5

"Since they basically banned injecting wastewater into the Arbuckle formation (very deep, but cheap to inject into because it's on suction; you basically just have to open a valve to it as opposed to using an expensive pump to ""buck"" the positive pressure of other formations), the earthquakes have not occurred as often. They were quite frequent in the northern part of the state five or six years ago which--curiously enough--was also where an absolute shit ton of saltwater was being injected at the time.
