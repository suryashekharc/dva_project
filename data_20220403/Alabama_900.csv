Coffman also carried a loaded handgun and a loaded revolver as he walked around the area that day.

"LOL!  You'd be surprised to find out that humans are cheaper than the level of automation a FC would require.  It's easier to automate assistance than outright replacement.

For example, Amazon is spending money on robotic carts that will lessen the need for an employee to run all over the FC to fulfill an order.  The employees will stay in their zones and automation will assist with getting the items to the point of shipping where employees will be needed to complete even that task.

"Alabama is a right to work state meaning you can not be forced into a union to be employed. You can however still join a union. 

Speaking from personally experience. Small businesses love you if you go to them and bargain for what you can agree to be a fair wage for the work you do. 

I worked from a friend of mine and still do occasionally to this day who run a liquidation business. $15 and hour starting as a high schooler in 2014 and we had a great relationship. I worked hard and was efficient and he knew my worth and was willing to pay me accordingly. Unions only hurt small businesses who can't afford all the over head and other shit the employee unrightful want. Working conditions, wages, all these things people say we need unions for aren't really a problem anymore like the were in the 60-70's. Office building don't just crumble and lock themselves when they catch on fire. 

No. People have gotten soft and raised their egos. And with a heightened ego you tend to think your more valuable than you are. In reality, there 1500 mfs in your area who could do the same job, with more or equal efficientcy, and for equal or less money and would happily do it. 

Now if your working a corporate job (which I hate and would never do again cuz fuck that noise they could care less about you but that is their right they are giving you money to do labor and leave) it's understandable to unionize. 

But I learned a lot of lesson from Jimmy Hoffa that apparently no one remembers exactly how corrupt, gross, and incompetent unions are once they outlived the purpose of their creation. Just having a union to be unionized and not to make changes is retarded. Once the changes are made shut up do your work get paid and go home. No need to keep it around 'just for funsies' and unfortunately for all the people out there that just wanna suck unions cock a lot of people in Alabama and specifically the Birmingham area have been taken advantage of by unions before in the steel industry and aren't about that shit. Either pay me what I think my labor is worth or I'll find work elsewhere. That's is the conversation that needs to go down more regularly rather than holding a business ransom until your demands are met.

Not saying this is the case with Amazon in Bessemer because they could totally afford to make changes but go and bargain for your wages and conditions before trying unionize because as an employer you absolutely vaule some employees over others and would definitely be willing to pay the ones you value more, more money.",t2_8dngrv04,mister_revenant_,0,1648843658.0,0,t1_i30ydct,i30ydct,True,alison_bee,t3_ttihqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/ttihqs/amazon_apparently_wins_second_bessemer_union_vote/,Amazon apparently wins second Bessemer union vote count,/r/Alabama/comments/ttihqs/amazon_apparently_wins_second_bessemer_union_vote/i30ydct/,1,r/Alabama,0,1

>Investigators said Carli agreed to meet Marcus Spanevelo there to exchange custody of their three-year-old child.

On Monday, family members reported Carli missing. Deputies went to the restaurant and found her car parked there with her purse still inside, but no sign of Carli.

“We consider her missing/endangered. In other words, we don’t know what happened to her. We don’t have evidence specifically pointing to homicide, an abduction, or any of those,” Sheriff Johnson said. “We just know the way she has gone missing concerns us greatly.”

**Spanevelo was located in Birmingham on Wednesday. He had the child with him and the daughter is safe**, the sheriff said.

"An example of a god-given right is having the freedom the think about whatever you want, however you want; to have your own opinions & to express yourself internally & externally how you choose. Owning a weapon is not a god-given/human right. I get what you’re saying about some of these felons who have served their time wanting to protect themselves, but if owning a weapon is a god-given right, then the person they’re protecting themselves against also has a god-given right to own a weapon & therefore are given the freedom to violate the ex-felon’s protection & hurt or kill them. As someone with a list of mental illness diagnoses & has been hospitalized in the past for suicidal thoughts, I personally don’t think I should have the right to own a gun, because given my mental health in the past, if I had a gun, suicide would be much more likely than if I didn’t have one—and that same thing goes for many mentally ill people, so I wouldn’t say it’s a god-given right. But unfortunately, if I decided to go buy a gun, there wouldn’t be anything stopping me from owning it. 

I agree that some laws in this state are a bit ridiculous, but the less you play by the rules of the state, the more likely you will end up in jail or prison. Which will ultimately lead to making it more difficult to keep or get a job, have a stable income, pay for all necessities including a house/shelter, which ultimately means your quality of life will be dulled a lot, especially if you continue to fight the law. If you want to live an anti-law life, you will have to go to an anarchist community. There is one in Portland, which I believe is the only in the U.S. Then there’s a couple in Mexico.

"I am particularly excited for the scenery and weather. My fiancé and I love to hike and explore the outdoors. 

If you don’t mind, How does slower pace of life manifest? I apologize but I guess I don’t know what you mean by that exactly. 

As someone particularly interested in politics, I’ve been looking into Alabama and the election laws (specifically ballot access) appears especially abhorrent. As a ticket splitter I value having third-party options, but I suppose that’s not a deal breaker. 

From my research COL seemed fairly comparable, somethings higher, somethings lower (at least from the Fort Wayne area) but I didn’t know about the taxes (good to know).

"So you couldn't find anything that said the guns were confiscated from felons, they were automatics, or that the guns were stolen like you asserted earlier. The only thing that article says is that 75 guns were confiscated.

Instead you provided more speculation.  I don't know why you are being confrontational. I simply pointed out that more people carrying guns will increase the likelihood that someone will try to settle an argument with a gun. It's just probability.

Also because Alabama now made it legal for you to carry your gun with you, there is nothing that you can do about it.

Here's your question:

>Is that enough or what do you feel like I should do? I’d rather not go confront people tearing down a Walmart, carrying an AK Pistol, shooting someone over a disagreement, etc so with those things excluded what can I do??

"While I think a wall AND those technological means are vastly superior to those technological means alone, I think a wall is still inferior to helping Mexico secure it's own southern border (and therefore ours, to a large degree) and at least eroding the power of the cartels in Mexico.  

A large percentage of the cartels' business is in trafficking people from South America into the US. If those people can't get through Mexico, that alone is a good hit. It would also free up significant enforcement resources to focus on narcotics trafficking, allowing us to put more pressure on their operations inside the US without having to do anything extra.  

Now, if we could the above AND have a working drug policy (*cough, Portugal, cough cough*) we could make some crushing headway.

"Being arrested for possessing a firearm and federal charges being likely means that they were either arrested for Felon in Possession or Illegally modified weapons such as Automatics, Silencers, etc because those are federal crimes where merely possessing a weapon without a permit is merely a misdemeanor violation (Assuming a permit is even still required until the new constitutional carry goes into effect or whatever)

A Felon in Possession or FIP is a federal crime with a mandatory minimum sentence, 85% of which has to be served 

So, Whenever a felon is caught in possession of a firearm the state will charge them as they normally would  - Then they forward the information to the feds - Once the feds are ready to charge them the state drops the charges and the person is indicted by the feds.

It makes it so that the FIP gets nearly a decade rather than a year or 2.

Wow a snarky answer to an uncomfortable question.

If you actually read the Real ID act of 2005, you'd see this really had nothing to do with security but to tighten down on immigration. In addition to that symbol being placed on everyone's drivers license, it also:

* Changed visa limits on temporary workers
* Funded reports and pilot projects related to border security
* Introduced rules for delivery bonds, which is like a bail bond but for aliens pending court cases
* Updating and tightening laws surround asylum and deportation of aliens for terrorism
* Waiving laws that interfered with construction of barriers at the border.

The context of the law makes it very clear that the intent was to use 9/11 to not only clamp down on immigration but to make it easier for non-citizens and illegal aliens to be identified by the public.",t2_fckzx,space_coder,0,1648645810.0,0,t1_i2plbcp,i2plbcp,False,thelcor,t3_tqzzcx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Alabama/comments/tqzzcx/star_id_question/,STAR ID question,/r/Alabama/comments/tqzzcx/star_id_question/i2plbcp/,1,r/Alabama,0,1

According to the Ontario Harm Reduction Network (OHRN), there have been no laboratory-confirmed cases of fentanyl laced cannabis. The rumor that drug dealers lace weed with fentanyl to cause clients to develop drug addiction is not substantiated, or financially sound. According to OHRN, fentanyl has a high-profit margin, whereas marijuana has a low-profit margin.

No, it’s is a Real ID-compliant Alabama driver licence. You need to show proof of citizenship and residency to get one. If the rule ever goes into effect, it’ll be necessary to have a Real ID to fly domestically. Other forms include passport, passport card, trusted traveller ID, military ID, green card, etc.

Your enhanced driver licence is compliant with the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative. It can be used in place of a passport for land and sea entry into member countries. US passport card and trusted traveller IDs are also WHTI-compliant.
