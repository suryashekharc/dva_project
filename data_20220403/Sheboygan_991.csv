"Non-Wisconsin native here. But I presently live in Sheboygan with 3 kids and have lived in a lot of the small communities in the Sheboygan-Fond du Lac area so I may be able to offer some perspective.

This area, like most of Wisconsin, is full of small to medium sized communities that are relatively self-contained with their own schools, restaurants, grocery, church, etc. They all have their own identities and a few employers anchoring each town. LOTS of cheese making & manufacturing in this general area. 

Sheboygan is the largest by far & naturally has the most going on. John Michael Kohler Art Center, the Weill Center & the Village Green are gems that host a variety of ""cultural"" experiences (art, music, etc). Lots of great dining in Sheboygan. The lake front is beautiful. There are a few box stores (Target, Walmart, Kohls) and increasingly there are nice boutiques popping up throughout the county but a proper mall experience is unavailable without about an hours travel north or south. 

Plymouth is the next largest community and has most of the same but in smaller amounts. 
Kohler, Sheboygan Falls & Howards Grove feel like a type of suburb of Sheboygan, where many people who live in those communities may do a lot of their errands in Sheboygan. Elkhart Lake is a small resort town. Nice to visit in summer & the Road America race track is a big draw.

Because Kiel is further out I think some residents there may also spend some time in Manitowoc too. 

You'll figure out winters. Don't worry about that. Get ready to find great meals in local places that might be scary to walk into at first. You won't miss the chain restaurants at all. The cheese & beer reputation is all real and not an exaggeration (and its awesome). If anyone asks you if you want a single or a double brat, get the double and whatever town you settle into you will find that its a pretty good place to live and raise a family.",t2_a5iti01p,SamInSheboygan,0,1649009859.0,0,t1_i392lqv,i392lqv,True,Ok-Needleworker9143,t3_tv0qeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheboygan/comments/tv0qeu/relocating/,Relocating,/r/sheboygan/comments/tv0qeu/relocating/i392lqv/,2,r/sheboygan,0,2
"I work in Kiel and live in Sheboygan! It’s about a 30-35 minute drive to work every day. Although when it’s snowing it does take much longer because the roads leading there don’t get much attention and the drifting can be bad. It took me an hour to make the drive during one of the storms this winter! 

Sheboygan is nice to live in, although the schools weren’t great when I was there (class of 2015). I attending Sheboygan schools starting in 4K and transferred out to Kohler after my freshman year of high school and was much happier. I decided I’m staying in the area so my kids can also attend Kohler now that I’m at that point in life. 

I’ve moved around Wisconsin a good bit because of attending different colleges and I think Sheboygan is a place to stay. Although if you are looking at buying a house, definitely pay attention to the area. It’s not that anywhere in Sheboygan is absolutely horrible to live in, but with kids, I’d definitely be a bit more particular about the neighborhood.

"Wow, cross country to Kiel. You could in for a bit of a culture shock depending on where you're coming from. 

Kiel has maybe 4,000 people, it's pretty rural. The only supermarket is the Piggly Wiggly (that's a southern chain that also has a bunch of Wisconsin locations for unclear reasons). They also have a Dollar General and a Kwik Trip. Kwik Trip is a convenience store chain that is very popular with Wisconsinites (owing to their wide selection of hot food available). There's a McDonalds and a few local restaurants (Parker John's is good). And that's about it. They used to have a Shopko (Midwestern home goods store), but they all went out of business a few years ago.

The closest Walmart is 10-15 miles away, either in Chilton or in Plymouth (where I live).

Winters are long and bleak up here, we just had some snow yesterday and projected for more snow / rain mix on Monday.

Kwik Trip is the best gas station chain. They've got food that they make there snd they've got the best donuts, which are called, ""Glazers"". I definitely recommend going inside sometime.
There's a great ice cream place in Sheboygan called, ""South Pier Parlor"". It's open during the summer, and I recommend bringing your family there.

A few of the folks in my org commute from the north shore suburbs to sheboygan. Depending on work schedule, that may work for you.

My take so far is that sheboygan is much less diverse ethnically and socioeconomically than MKE. 

I think there are many good things sheboygan has going for it, including quieter, less crime, lower COL, than MKE. Some of the restaurants are great as well. Though on the flip side, I have the impression it is much more family centric than MKE. 

I think it depends what you are looking for. 

Also, not sure what the poster means by inner city milwaukee. Games are miller park, fiserv? Concerts at pabst, riverside, turner? Boating on lake michigan - sheboygan has that.

The Weill center has had some good shows. I recently saw Post Modern Jukebox there and it was great.
The surrounding towns also are cool to explore… Manitowoc, Port Washington, Cederberg come to mind…
I am sure Sheboygan will be a big change, all I can say is that I am enjoying it so far…

I've been in Sheboygan for 20 years and my two teenage boys have been raised here and I've never once expected the city to provide them with entertainment. We watch movies and TV and do board games together at home. They play video games online with friends. We go to the JMKAC or play board games and drink hot chocolate at Paradigm. We cook together. We go to the library. We go to Urbane on Tuesday nights and get destroyed at trivia. We *gasp* talk to each other. We share dumb TikToks and educational YouTube videos with each other. And on and on.

"This was before my time. When I was growing up in Sheboygan it was a sticker that wrapped around the bike frame.

When I was in Little League, the police officers used to hand out baseball cards from their patrol vehicles.

On the way back home from a game near South High, we stopped to ask for cards from an officer who was parked in front of Farnsworth school on Union Ave.

I was near the back of the pack and after all the other kids had gotten cards the officer asked about my bike not having a license. I didn't even realize bikes needed to be licensed.

I got a ""ticket"" (note to my parents to get the bike licensed) and never got a baseball card.

"Sheboygan needs to work on developing the water front in the manner that Port Washington has taken. Port is doing an excellent job with condos, townhomes, and small businesses locating in the marina area. A lot of retirees from the Milwaukee area are looking at Port and Sheboygan for the smaller town lakefront vibe and end up choosing Port due to the availability of high quality, maintenance free housing. 200-300 units around the armory site and vacant river sites would do wonders for activity and population retention. Affordable housing infill is also a must throughout the city, but I feel like they are doing a good job moving on that. Middle to upper middle income apartments are also a must downtown to capture and retain all of the young professionals that are brought in annually to work at Acuity, Kohler, and the other various corporate HQs around town.

"According to [this](https://www.sheboyganwi.gov/city-to-purchase-former-save-a-lot-building/) the city has owned the old building since 1999 and they were doing a feasibility study on staying with the old building until the HVAC/Roof failure. Which to me seems to say the deferred maintenance played a larger role in the decision than the size… Maybe we should try to maintain our public goods instead of letting them slowly fall into disrepair.

As for the armory being to big the difference is negligible when you consider that, while the senior center is amazing, we lack a community center for everyone else. The armory could have served both purposes. It was centrally located as to not make it less convenient to get to than the current location. Regardless, it doesn’t matter what’s done is done, but I will absolutely take every opportunity I can to point out how asinine it is to “save” and pour money into a poorly located, ugly, cinderblock grocery store without anyone even so much as asking how it’s being paid for when merely two years ago the whole city was up in arms about saving a historically relevant and well located publicly owned building “WhO’s GoInG tO pAy FoR iT?” 

It’s just sad how easily our community is manipulated because we have all but non-functioning news outlets which “report” only what the city spoon feeds them. Paying to tear down a public building that we already owned, and then spending millions to do studies and eventually renovate said grocery store… If I didn’t pay taxes it would be absolutely hilarious how much “they” get away with and how quickly people will come to the defense of their absolutely terrible track record in caring for our public goods and use of public funds.",t2_1neg4,dschaefer,0,1635789983.0,0,t1_hiwslrc,hiwslrc,False,xEDGELORD75x_,t3_qk7c6w,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheboygan/comments/qk7c6w/what_do_you_guys_think_is_gonna_happen_to_the_old/,What do you guys think is gonna happen to the old Save a Lot?,/r/sheboygan/comments/qk7c6w/what_do_you_guys_think_is_gonna_happen_to_the_old/hiwslrc/,0,r/sheboygan,0,0

"(Edit in italics) *stopping* People *from* saying people should be taking medicine manufacturers and doctors are actively asking people not to take is not partisan and *those stances* actively threaten public health and safety. People saying the vaccine is bad, or vaccinated people are idiots are threatening public health. I’m not mandating that you be vaccinated, or even share my opinion. I’m saying that r/Sheboygan is not the place to “debate the issue”. If you don’t understand why, that’s ok, but it doesn’t change the fact that these are the rules. 

If you would like to debate why we need more apartments, or why we should replace the lighthouse with a giant statue of the chordettes, or that our roads aren’t as bad as everyone says they are… I will disagree with these clearly subjective points of view that pertain to this city and I will not ban you, because you’re using this place for its intended purpose and not harming the community.

"**[Herd immunity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity)** 
 
 >Herd immunity (also called herd effect, community immunity, population immunity, or mass immunity) is a form of indirect protection from infectious disease that can occur with some diseases when a sufficient percentage of a population has become immune to an infection, whether through vaccination or previous infections, thereby reducing the likelihood of infection for individuals who lack immunity. Immune individuals are unlikely to contribute to disease transmission, disrupting chains of infection, which stops or slows the spread of disease.

I liked Straight talk a lot and would still probably be using them if not for the fact that I get a discount through work and the price after the discount is pretty close to what we would have spent upgrading both our lines to ST's unlimited plan. 

If you're looking at prepaid plans, I can recommend Straight Talk with confidence, but porting your number to them can be a little slow - when  we moved over (again almost a decade ago) it took 2-3 days for everything to fully complete the move, i was  getting texts on one phone and calls on another (we had bought new, different phones -not  from straight talk- because we needed to upgrade anyway). $45 for their 25gb plan is great, $55/mo if you need unlimited data.",t2_4vs3y,SirRipo,0,1633227812.0,0,t1_hf6chnd,hf6chnd,True,ConsistentAmount4,t3_q00qtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheboygan/comments/q00qtw/cell_phone_recommendations/,Cell Phone Recommendations,/r/sheboygan/comments/q00qtw/cell_phone_recommendations/hf6chnd/,3,r/sheboygan,0,3

"Hi there! Extending a preemptive welcome to the area :) If you can afford it, Kohler is a close, nice, manicured town with the best public school district in the area (and 4th best public school district in the state!). As far as areas in Sheboygan, many areas are pretty safe. Some people choose to avoid the southern residential area’s of Sheboygan. Elkhart Lake, Oostburg, and Howard’s Grove offer a small tight-knit community feel (these towns and Kohler all have population amounts similar to Hammond). Plymouth (14,000ish) and Sheboygan Falls (8000ish) have slightly larger populations and have slightly more to do, although none of these places are far from Sheboygan at all (10, 20 minutes at the most).

"I’ve worked for several different dealers as a tech and if you’re buying used it’s a roll of the dice so I say RESEARCH! Look at common problems with the vehicle you want and how to tell if the problem is present. It’s easy. Next ask to see maintenance records if available or ask for a MULTIPOINT INSPECTION TO BE DONE. I’ve seen several techs who just wanna clock in and clock out miss some pretty obvious problems with used trade ins so a second set of eyes might be good. Ask for a copy of the multipoint. Once the vehicle is bought you can ask for another tech at another location to do a multipoint and if anything is amiss you got a good case for a buy back. Sometimes when we get used cars in it’s a 50-50 if the sales person wants to replace the brake pads or do a fluid flush, or even put new wipers on. So do your research and be thorough as hell.

"Yeah I had an absolutely horrendous experience at the budget auto in Plymouth. It was my first time buying a car and I had no clue what I was doing. How the loan process worked, trade-in worked, etc. They were the most unhelpful and standoffish people I have ever met. Treating me like a complete idiot because I didn't know how the process worked. Thankfully I stuck to my guns and didn't falter with the car I had my eyes on, because they were not going to sell it to me willingly. I had the car test driven and looked up & down at the mechanic, and it had a couple minor issues. I tell them that and they try to tell me my guy is wrong and their inspection said it's just fine and I don't know what I'm talking about. Honestly treating me like I'm the dumbest person on the planet. So then I decided to go ask my financial advisor at my credit union how it works instead, and got the information I needed. Went back to the dealership and got an itemized final price, got the check, walked into the financial officers office avoiding the TWO salesmen I had worked with (both were total fuckheads), and slapped it down and said ""I want that car, my car is outside, and I'm not leaving unless it's in that car."" Both salesmen all apologetic and trying to kiss my ass now all of a sudden. Trying to give me free car wash coupons and oil changes and this and that. The one was about to change the license plate over and I just grabbed it out of his hands.

As for softball you don’t have to go through a bar those are just the majority of the sponsors. Go to the wild wood park and let them know at the club house that you’re interested in joining a team and maybe they’ll help you fill out someone’s roster?

"Im an outside guy, so I've got a few outdoor suggestions.  

The beach is a fun place to go that's free.  King Park is a local favorite because it's not too crowded, but DeLand Park is nice too.

"“Induced demand” has been debunked in most instances.

The owners of the individual properties being rented out are very unlikely to be basing the purchase price/ rent price/ investment decision on a couple hundred units of housing downtown that isn’t competing for the same renters.

"Hey Elonkey.

I think if you get some feedback on reddit, you're very likely going to only be getting data on a very small slice of the Sheboygan population. I'm pretty sure you're already doing your due diligence to get as much aggregate data as you can, but I wouldn't be surprised to see some serious skewing of data based on what stream that data is acquired from. Heck, that alone might be interesting to see, frankly.

One issue that's huge to me is corporate involvement in politics. It skews politics on both ends of the spectrum, almost always to the detriment of constituents. That's not a good thing regardless of where you stand on party lines, I'd say. This might be my #1 if I absolutely had to choose.

But it's really hard to do that. There are a huge number of issues that I care about, and picking a single one forces me to give up a ton of political nuance. I try not to post too much political stuff on reddit so happy to continue the conversation in PM's, or something. Healthcare, education, election reform, prison/sentencing reform, etc- all important issues that are lost in picking a single one.

"This is a good point. To clarify, when I think of Sheboygan's growth, it's mostly at the county level. We were having a conversation this last weekend about how Sheboygan has much smaller surrounding neighboring city/towns than something like the Green Bay or Milwaukee Greater Areas (obviously it's relative to the size of the urban center); however, there is a lot of potential, as you mentioned. 

I certainly see the ""center of mass"" of Sheboygan moving west over time.

"Don't live in sheboygan anymore, but population growth in the city is unlikely.  Growth is only going to happen inside the county, not the city itself.  I could be wrong, but I think the empty nesters will offset any growth in the big apartment complexes that pop up every few years.  Growth in the state itself, if I recall correctly, will peak in the mid 2030s, so there is practically no way the city will have huge jumps in population in the next 10 years unless some major employer with 1000+ jobs decides to relocate in the county and we get the ugly cookie cutter apartment complexes that have 200 plus units to replace aging single family houses.

The area between FDL and Sheboygan, because of the good paying cheeseplants, Mercury Marine, Kohler will have a huge expansion in suburbs.  The new 4 lane hwy23 will make commuting a simple 30 min drive between Plymouth area and FDL.  IMO, the combination of road america, long/Elkhart/Winnebago lakes, kettle moraine forest, the paved bike path on 23 beats anything that Oconomowoc/Delafield has to offer but for 1/3 the price and fewer crowds.

"I love this city and I am excited to see it grow. If it is ACTUALLY growing and not just people buying summer homes that will sit empty for 9 months out of the year. But I’ll remain positive and hope people are taking up permanent residence here... 

That said, IMO SCEDC is a grift at worst and a lobbiest org that hurts taxpayers at best. It’s the same good ol boys club that’s existed in this county for decades except now they found a way to get their hands on taxpayer money. Their annual budget is like $300k the majority of which goes to salaries... I don’t remember if it’s $100k each or $50k each but the city of sheboygan and the county of sheboygan each give them either 50 or 100k of taxpayer money annually. That’s a shit ton of taxpayer money, which would be ok if there was some kind of measure-able ROI or some kind of performance requirement. They’ve done little to nothing in the way of job creation. The majority of their recent efforts have been focused on getting the city to heavily subsidize housing developments by using Tax Incremental Financing (meaning the developments are a break even scheme, at best, for taxpayers for the first 15-20 years) and “the innovation district” which is a half baked idea that no one is asking for except for Dave Sachse Sr. because he supposedly dumped a few million in the refurbished factory turned apartment buildings in that area so now he expects taxpayers to foot the bull for an inorganic business district built on buzzwords and expensive consultants... oh they also want a parking garage down there that taxpayers have already spent something like 400k researching/planning ...

So I’m glad sheboygan is growing but it’s growing at the expense of existing taxpayers. If people want to live, work, and play here I am all for that, but I’d much rather see our taxes spent on quality of place improvements rather than subsidizing rich out of town developers and rich good ol boys.",t2_1neg4,dschaefer,0,1620874104.0,0,t1_gxxo7s5,gxxo7s5,False,[deleted],t3_nauk57,https://www.reddit.com/r/sheboygan/comments/nauk57/is_it_me_or_are_a_lot_of_people_moving_here/,Is it me or are a LOT of people moving here recently?,/r/sheboygan/comments/nauk57/is_it_me_or_are_a_lot_of_people_moving_here/gxxo7s5/,5,r/sheboygan,0,5

"Ozaukee County is the 25th wealthiest county in the United States. It’s definitely an area where any decent house ends up in a bidding war. Ozaukee county is popular with Sheboygan peeps as it allows spouses to work in Sheboygan, but have access to the Milwaukee job market with a short commute. The Sheboygan area on its own seems like a very nice place to live. It’s definitely a place where a younger couple can have a nice life and afford a house, but have access to Milwaukee, Green Bay, and Door County all within an hour.

Edit to add that I concur with their assessment as well. Sheboygan definitely has far more to do than other cities of its size. The area is also very popular with Milwaukee and Chicago people.

"I have been following the market very closely as well. Sheboygan-Kohler is a steal compared to Milwaukee. I think a lot of people who typically work in the Sheboygan area tended to locate in Cedarburg, Mequon, etc in the past. I see that changing due to housing prices. Sheboygan also didn’t have shit for young professionals until the last couple years. All those new employees end up getting places near Milwaukee and commuting.

"My friend was actually considering buying this house, so we walked through it. 
For me personally, the living room and kitchen were kinda small, the basement had very low ceilings and a cracked floor, and one of the upstairs bedrooms has very slanted ceilings. The neighborhood doesn't seem super bad, just a lot of rentals and a bar across the street, so that might be why it's a bit more affordable.

It didn't end up being my or my friend's cup of tea, but the family who lived there really knew how to do interior design!! Very hard not to be impressed by all of that.

Edit: Forgot to add that we heard the history of the previous owners: 
Apparently, they are a young family and one of the parents is a pastor. The father received a job offer in another state, so they're parting with their house kind of unexpectedly.

It’s not the greatest area in Sheboygan but the price seems pretty in line with the market around here (we bought a house two years ago for 105k).
