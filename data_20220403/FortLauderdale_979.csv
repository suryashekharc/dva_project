"Laser Wolf is good - it's close to downtown FTL (not oakland park). Invasive Species breweery is pretty similar as well (I think the owners came/are from LW).

Lotus in Wilton is our staple Chinese place.  You'll see lots of regulars there who have been coming for years.  Great for dining in, but their takeout service is very efficient and super reliable.  Homemade duck sauce too you can request if that's your thing.  We've tried a few of their dishes and never been disappointed.

"“Honest use car dealership” is an oxymoron.  What you are actually dealing with is with is “which is the least evil.”

> I've heard of bad experiences with used car places reposessing vehicles at the stroke of mid night over missed payments.

This indicates that you are not even close to being in a financial position to purchase a car.   My suggestion is to use public transport for a while and save up at least $3000 for two emergency funds.  $1000 for a general emergency fund that will cover unexpected expenses like plane tickets to see a sick/dying relative or tires because you dove through some debris damaging all four.  The second $2000 is funds to cover your minimum payments including car note and insurance for a month or two should you lose your job.

These funds are not to be touched unless it’s a genuine emergency.  A last minute getaway to the keys with your friends doesn’t count as an “emergency.”

You want to do this because if you are late one day, there is no forgiveness.  You will hurt your credit and pay higher interest and insurance rates. You are forced to deal with the scum of the automotive world and in your financial position with your current mindset, this is a hamster wheel you’ll never be able to jump off of until you start making better moves. 

Start with getting some financial security first.  Then, try to buy a car from Carmax with a limit of $10K.  If you can’t do that, find a mechanic and pay him to do an pre-purchase inspection and buy a decent quality vehicle. Looking for a dealer that  that doesn’t repossess immediately upon non-payment ignores the fact that this dealer will likely sell you a lemon knowing full well you can’t afford to fix it when it breaks down.",t2_h6w5s16z,ColibriPrime,1,1648833672.0,0,t1_i309w06,i309w06,True,Cajete,t3_ttv1mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortlauderdale/comments/ttv1mr/any_decent_and_honest_used_car_dealerships_around/,Any decent and honest used car dealerships around?,/r/fortlauderdale/comments/ttv1mr/any_decent_and_honest_used_car_dealerships_around/i309w06/,-4,r/fortlauderdale,0,-4

"Oh dude, Mapleridge puts you right in the middle of everything. Perfect spot. 

You would also be two seconds from Hard Rock casino. It's a ginormous guitar with a huge lasers pointing up. Can't miss it.

Personally I try to avoid this place because they're very good getting you to spend all your money. But none the less a very cool place you should hit up. Kind of like a small Adult disney world. It's beautiful. They also have cool pool parties during the day at the hotel.

"Yeah definitely skip Daytona. Ft.laudy is where you want to be. 

If you want a great bar to go to at the fort Lauderdale beach, Elbow Room is your place. Always popping, especially on a Sunday. 

Then for night life downtown fun there's the strip on 2nd Ave. Everyone goes bar hopping there, but it's totally overrated imo. As tourist, you should make a stop. But it just gets super crowded. A little tough to meet girls because of the over crowdedness and somewhat younger college crowd. Original Fat Cats is your best bet.

But that area has a ton of smaller bars surrounding it, more low key and much easier to meet girls. I recommend Rhythm & Vine

There is also Wilton Manors, which is ""gay town"" but none the less Wilton drive is so much fun...They also have a late night restaurant called NewYork Grilled Cheese, you MUST try. There is also a club in the middle called The Manor. It's probably the best club in fort Lauderdale. Definitely worth going. 

Hollywood board walk is a Must. It's just south of ft.laud. Super chill and lax area. There is also a stage along the walk where they have live music every evening. Definitely.

"There are a few game stores in town. As others have mentioned in this thread, **Tate's** is a good option in Tamarac. It is a big comic book store and there is a gaming satellite next door (though I think there are some better options for gaming). You could try **Hey Wanna Play** in Planation. That place is an all around awesome gaming store. They have a big miniatures presence, but everyone there is super friendly and I would not be surprised if you found some D&D fans. I think your best bet in the area is **The Adventure Game Store & Dragon's Lair** in Davie/Hollywood. It's not the best store all-around, but there's definitely a D&D presence and tabletop RPG crowd.

Showed up at 825pm with no RESY for 2. We waited 1h after the waiter gave away our table 3x before realizing we were before all of the others. NBD. 

We saw down finally around 930pm after the waiter promised to “make it up to us for the mistake” (Spoiler: they never comped anything on our bill)

Dinners comes: got the wrong entree after waiting 45 mins (it is now 1030pm). 

And they forgot our side we ordered. 

Everything was ok. Mussels had sand in them and were not cleaned. 

No idea how this place scores 4.5/5 on Yelp. I’ve had better experiences at random diners in NYC. Lol

Icing on cake was still being charged for the side of yucca we asked for but never received. Had to ask waiter to take it off before he realize we never got it. He would’ve if he checked on us once during our 1h dining experience.

"Amtrak is your best bet as others have mentioned.

I used to have the exact same scenario as you.  I would cancel trips or if I went, I would be miserable the entire time I was there worrying about the return trip.  I was able to get some Xanax prescribed by my doctor to use when flying.  I usually take them the entire day I'll be flying with my last does when I get on the plane.  The first few flights on it, I was still pretty nervous but not terrified like before.  After several ""good"" flights on Xanax, I can fly without it now (although I still fly with it when the weather is sketchy or any time I feel I need it).  If that will work for you, you'll get to where you can just pop your Xanax, put on some headphones, and sleep most of the flight.  Good luck.

I’ve talked to therapists about this and the reply has always been the same: exposure therapy. I’ve watched countless ‘how you shouldnt be afraid to fly’ videos and I still have the phobia :(

I might take the train instead. I was gonna do the Sleeper thing but it’s $550 (it rooms two people), sounds like a waste of money. I think I might just do coach since it’s a third of the price.

Consider that Fort Lauderdale to NYC via Greyhound to be Part of Your Vacation!

I did so from Chicago to Fort Lauderdale in early 1998, and I never left. It was an experience I'll never forget. I have put nearly all of my airplane trips out of mind though.

Greyhound is cheap too. Go make it happen, you can book it online or go down to Federal/NE 3rd street to the terminal today.

Hope you feel better and get out there to have some fun!

"I got contacted them for a place in Atlanta Georgia near campus by a Derrick Williams. It was $1200 a month for a 1 bedroom, fully furnished. Yea fucking right, not in Midtown Atlanta. I sat on this offer for a while to verify things and they were saying things like ""book quickly before someone else does"" if they were legit it would have been booked immediately. They found me because I posted on the FB group for Gtech students looking for apartments. What a bunch of ass holes. They tried to get another $100 out of me as a ""deposit for the lease contract.""

"I am a professional piano player and orchestral composer / arranger, I live in Miami beach, but my parents live in Fort lauderdale.

You're not going to be able to get anybody who's very good for less than about $300 a show. At that point, you're probably looking for somebody like a local player who plays in bar bands and stuff.

"Ah I meet so many people at the gym I would definitely recommend getting a membership again. I used to workout at titan gym which is a small bodybuilder gym in north federal, great atmosphere but not your typical gym at all. LA fitness is a decent place to meet friends, and there is one not too far from DT. But if you’re serious about the gym it’s meh. 

Then again, the gym at your apartment is a great place to meet neighbors. I’ve been meaning to check out the gym at the Aviah, I have a few friends that live there. 

There are some trails and a disc golf course at Snyder park but they rarely get used. 

Honestly I wouldn’t suggest the bars downtown to anyone, most of the people down there aren’t even 21 and let’s just say it’s not the right place to meet boyfriend material lol. You are probably really close to rhythm and vine, great little bar. There are bars in FAT village where I’m sure you will love the vibes, it’s the art district so you will meet likeminded people there. Also the wharf IMO is the best bar to meet people in Fort Lauderdale. American social on las olas is also great.

What kind of music are you into?

"You're definitely in the wrong place then unfortunately. There's a reason people say it's a nightmare to date in South Florida. The odds of finding what you're looking for aren't great. The best advice I can give you is to move somewhere else. The other piece of advice I can give you is to ask people what their principles/values are when you are with them in person. This should help you quickly assess their personal context and save you time. Not satisfied with their answer? Don't pursue them any further.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Delta-8 THC is one of more than 100 cannabinoid compounds found in the cannabis plant, which include CBD and Delta-9 THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana

A cannabis plant that has more than .3 percent Delta-9 THC is marijuana; the same plant with less than .3 percent of Delta-9 THC is called hemp. Both CBD, the natural remedy found everywhere from health-food stores to smoke shops, and Delta-8 THC come from hemp

The federal Farm Bill enacted in 2018 legalized the commercial use of hemp and derivative products as long as they met the established definition of hemp: no more than .3 percent of Delta-9 THC.""

"OP don't do this lol. Jack's is nasty. The place is old and dirty and you can get way better burgers at other spots. Also, who wants their lettuce and tomato coming in a plastic baggie lmao. 

Anyway try, 

Tacocraft - fun vibe, good tacos and guac 

Coyo Taco - Right off of las olas - the best steak quesadilla I've ever had. Bar is cool cause it sits outside so if it's a nice day, it's fun to sit out there. 

B Square - Awesome burgers on Las Olas. It's pricey but the burgers are crazy good. Cool vibe as well.

Henry's Sandwich Station - Really good, craft sandwiches. Not a bar vibe but good for a sandwich.

Colada - Not the most authentic Cuban food, but it's more of a trendy modern Cuban fusion place. Good stuff though. Again - not a bar vibe but a chill lunch spot. 

Tap 42 - Good vibe, fun drinks. Really diverse menu - sandwiches, burgers, salads, fish, etc. 

Batch New Southern Kitchen - Modern, trendy, southern fusion. Think mac and cheese, chicken & waffles, etc. Pricey, but food is solid. 

Heritage - The best Pizza in Fort Lauderdale. 

Louie Bossie's - On las Olas. Awesome vibe. Great Neapolitan pizza.

Foxy Brown - Good vibe. Good food. Kinda like comfort food, but it can be expensive there. 

Southport Raw Bar - Looks like a dive bar/restaurant but it's a classic in Fort Lauderdale. Good seafood, reasonable prices. Sit on the dock out back for a better vibe. 

Top Round - No bar vibe. Awesome roast beef sandwiches and fries. 

Laspadas - If you're looking for a quick sub to take to the beach - this is the spot.

Lunchroom - No bar vibe. Great sandwiches.",t2_e43pugls,chipotleplz,0,1647355445.0,0,t1_i0r6c6t,i0r6c6t,False,[deleted],t3_teq2sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/fortlauderdale/comments/teq2sn/best_lunch_spot/,Best lunch spot,/r/fortlauderdale/comments/teq2sn/best_lunch_spot/i0r6c6t/,0,r/fortlauderdale,0,0

"Again, not sure how old your children are because that would make a big difference on what you’d be able to do and I’m not sure what you’re looking for, I don’t have much info other then you’re looking to kill time. Unfortunately most of what that area has to offer is things on the water. Kayaking, fishing, airboat rides and things like that. I’d imagine you’d like to be outside and enjoy some Florida because you head back to somewhere cold so there’s tons of trails and parks all up and down the beach in that area. You could check out the Daina beach Pier and the area around it. If you’d be up for a drive, there’s some fun indoor things to do not far from there.

"Even if so, at 6 months their is now an independent living person that can be seen laughing, crying, listening, and interacting with the outside world. While I agree, it is a god awful situation.

Third term abortions are still denying the basic life of a separate entity and I think that 16 weeks is an appropriate cut off point. I have many friends who have been adopted, they are all firmly anti-abortion as well as admitting they're glad they are alive.

I'm actually pro-abortion. Their is a point and/or situations that abortion is absolutely appropriate ethically. Their is also a point where it is becomes unethical. New York State has carried out abortions on full term infants, 8 or 9 months in. With some individuals even advocating for post birth abortion.

what happens unfortunately is we begin to develop extreme views with our political identity, I would be having this same conversation with a total antiabortion republican nut job, in fact I have many many times to count.
