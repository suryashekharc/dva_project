Things seemed back to normal today. Spent the morning at Mansion Beach and it was pretty busy. Lots of stinging jellyfish there though, not sure if it's a result of the storm.

"Okay since I wrote that post, I've done about 5 major orders under a variety of circumstances, and I'm ready to write the book on this. Unfortunately it's not as simple as calling the ferry service.  For one, there's no clear way to get ahold of the freight office via their phone answering system. The option, 5, is not even divulged in the menu when you call any of the main numbers. And if you know about that option, it doesn't actually do anything unless you press it during the freight office operating hours, which in my experience seems to start at 8:30 a.m.  Even then, it is pretty hit or miss as to whether you will be able to get someone to answer the phone. Anyway, that just gets you the freight office at point Judith, not Block Island, and they really can't do anything to help you. More on that later. As for asking for help and getting information about this whole thing, if you can get ahold of the freight office, they will only give you quick answers and then have to get off the phone. This is because they are so overwhelmed with the amount of stuff that goes through.

Ideally you want to make sure your shipping address follows this format: 

Your name
Fire number, road
Block island, RI. 02807

And provide your phone for contact info.

Magically, this will cause a UPS/FedEx shipment to get routed via the Point Judith ferry terminal.  When your package makes it across, the Block Island side freight office will use this number to let you know that it's ready for you to pick it up. Walk into the freight office, bring your wallet as you'll pay for the ferry shipment there, and then they will bring it out to you. Actually, the local delivery service may instead just automatically deliver it directly to your house. I can't figure out what criteria is used to determine which of these things will happen.

Here are more details about what seems to go on under the hood, if you're interested. A source of complication for you is that Home Depot features a number of different methods of delivering. One is "" home delivery "", and that applies to an order that is being sent by the dot com side of the home Depot business (when a local store doesn't have what you want in stock). But there is another service called ""scheduled delivery"", and that is kind of a different beast. That is for an item that is coming from a Home Depot store (example: Westerly, North Kingston, etc.). If you call a store and order something, this is the type of delivery you will get. And in that case, you may not have control over how they address the package. They will most likely send it to 304 Great Island road, Narragansett, because this is how packages have always been shipped to Block Island up until fairly recently. If this is how your package is addressed, you will most likely still be able to get it, but you'll need to be armed with the following information to track your package down, in the event things get wacky.

A truck from home Depot brings your order to the ferry terminal at point Judith. All packages that arrive at point Judith, no matter how they do so (UPS, FedEx, specialty delivery truck) are loaded onto the next available boat that has room. Nothing on the address label is looked at or relevant at this point.  Once the package(s) make it across, they're processed by a delivery service, Lamb's. At this point, if your delivery was done via specialty truck, most likely they will keep the item, and try to call you via the contact info, and everything will be fine.  However, if it was shipped via UPS or FedEx, it will just be refused by Lamb's on the Block Island side and sent back, severely delaying, or cancelling the shipment. 

If you are unlucky and have some sort of exception in the process (i.e. The package was addressed wrong), you can't really call Lamb's (well you can, but you'll just get their answering machine, and it won't really do anything). The only way to interface with them is to physically go down to the dock at noon, and speak to one of the many drivers who are busy loading packages into their fleet of trucks.  Tell them your name and the tracking information, and ask them nicely if they would be on the lookout. If you're attitude is respectful of the workload they're up against, they will be very nice, and very helpful. 
 

TLDR;  Use this for your address/info:
Your name
Fire number, road
Block island, RI. 02807
A contact phone number

When the package arrives on B.I., you'll either get called to come get it at the dock, or it will just get dropped off at your place.",t2_1zkcjiui,mickeyfix,0,1625018597.0,0,t1_h3ihl5u,h3ihl5u,True,mickeyfix,t3_o1epo7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockIsland/comments/o1epo7/shipping_stuff_from_home_depot/,Shipping stuff from Home Depot,/r/BlockIsland/comments/o1epo7/shipping_stuff_from_home_depot/h3ihl5u/,2,r/BlockIsland,0,2

"Kind of disappointing in the pricing and I don't think it will work but I look at the find print.  If you have 3+, it is cheaper to get a regular cab.

But most rental houses seem to become available for booking in February (when we booked ours), so the January to March delay in opening the ferry reservations is def a factor.

"There are no-fly/restricted zones due to the airport, yes.  Here's DJI's zone map of the island: https://i.imgur.com/p1AoBVM.png

You can self-unlock the blue zone, but the red zone is restricted.  I've self-unlocked for a few years and haven't had a problem.

As far as regulations go, it's kinda hard to know what actually applies, different websites show different things.  Some say you can't be within X feet of a lighthouse, fly over animal reservations, etc but it's just all over the place.  At a minimum, pay the $5 cost to register the drone with the FAA.

"Hello! We absolutely loved Block Island. After checking in, we biked along Spring Street and visited the 1661 farm, the South(East?) lighthouse and the Bluffs. Rain started to hit, so we biked back to the main area and did some shopping around/eat. We ended the day with a dinner at National Hotel Fireside with live music. The food was great and we loved the chill atmosphere. 

The second day, we rented a moped to check out the North(west?) lighthouse. We flew our drone to capture the island and some seals...and lost it in the water due to low battery haha; I was pretty traumatized but he didn’t seem to care. We gave the moped back and decided to bike to the donut truck and then have lunch at The Oar. We liked the clam chowder at The Oar the most. Lovely views.

""New Shoreham Police Chief Vin Carlone and State Police Col. James Manni today announced to The Block Island Times that there will be a significantly increased state trooper presence on Block Island this coming weekend and for every weekend for the remainder of the summer. Col. Manni is expected to be part of the contingent this weekend, which could be up to eight additional troopers.
Chief Carlone said the presence of the additional troopers will be to deal specifically with vehicular traffic — of all types — and alcohol enforcement, adding that troopers will be on duty “24/7.” 

""I’m the one who made this request of the state police,” Carlone told The Block Island Times today. “We are in emergency circumstances. It’s like a carnival gone awry and I don’t have the staff to deal with this.”
Carlone said the “the purpose of this is to end the summer safely. The purpose is to have everyone drive safely on Block Island, which will be accomplished this year.” Carlone added, “some people like to think of this as a moped problem, but it is a collective problem with mopeds, trucks, cars, all vehicles.”
He said this weekend’s enforcement actions will “set the bar for everyone to follow the rules. No exceptions.” The program will be evaluated and analyzed as part of future law enforcement programs on the island, Carlone said.",t2_hadn1f,projo387,0,1597696259.0,0,t1_g1wmlc4,g1wmlc4,True,Blockis,t3_iblx6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockIsland/comments/iblx6d/emergency_town_council_meeting_817_5pm/,Emergency Town Council Meeting - 8/17 @ 5PM,/r/BlockIsland/comments/iblx6d/emergency_town_council_meeting_817_5pm/g1wmlc4/,3,r/BlockIsland,0,3

""After a moped accident yesterday that resulted in a fatality, and a  second person injured, and with continuing public outcry over moped  rentals on social media, the Town Council will be holding an emergency  meeting tonight at 7 p.m, Sunday, Aug. 16. The meeting will be  live-streamed on *The Block Island Times’* Facebook page, and on the Town of New Shoreham’s YouTube page.

There are two items on the agenda:

&#x200B;

1. Discuss and act on the Town Council convening in an emergency  meeting pursuant to Rhode Island General Law section 42-46-6(c) to  address an unexpected occurrence that requires immediate action to  protect the public and which results in this meeting being convened with  less than 48 hours' notice. Specifically, this meeting is required to  address the following: the recent series of moped and other accidents  culminating in a moped accident fatality yesterday as well as a serious  personal injury yesterday; the Town's reduced ability to deal with such  accidents and injuries because the number of the Town's rescue personnel  have been reduced to approximately a third as a result of personnel  electing not to respond because of the COVID-19 crisis; the overwhelming  of the Town's medical resources; and the overwhelming of the Town's  police force and resources.
2. Receive and act on a report from the police chief regarding the  matters referenced in agenda item #1. This matter may be held in closed  session pursuant to Rhode Island General Law 42-46-5(a) (3) discussions  regarding security, including, but not limited to, the deployment of  security personnel or devices.

"My fam goes every year. 
1. You need to have a reservation to bring your car on the ferry. Reservations are extremely hard to get...however, with covid that might be different this year. 
2. New London (CT) ferry is only high speed (no cars). Not sure about parking there as we always go from Pt Judith (RI)
3. The Pt Judith ferry is much less expensive and takes an hour. There are lots to park (grassy fields) that cost $10 a day, only a few hundred yards from ferry. Very safe. Ferry is about $30 round trip
4. BI is very small and the ferry is right in town. You can walk to a few different places to rent bikes/mopeds.  There are taxis, too and probably even uber drivers there these days. 
5.  The best beaches are a pretty far walk from town (Scotch beach, Mansion beach) so I would not suggest walking there.

"Helicopter tour is great.   Everything on the island is overpriced but i found that the heli tour is one of the only activities priced appropriately.    Spring house is right downtown where most of the small shops are located.    Probably not enough stores to make a full day out of shopping.  Several nice art galleries. You might not get much use out of bringing a car as all the best beaches and restaurants are within walking distance of Spring House.   Mopeds or bicycles are the best way to see the whole island.   Make sure to visit Mohegan bluffs.  There is also a taxi stand near the ferry.  The restaurant at Hotel Manisses is my favorite for upscale dining.   Los Gatitos is my favorite for casual.  Odd Fellows is my favorite for coffee and breakfast sandwiches.  Ballards is my favorite for beach and bar.   Bring your own snacks and drinks over with you on the ferry.  Not only will it save you a fortune,  the one and only general store is closed right now due to Covid.  There is a grocery store and liquor store within walking distance.  Liquor store prices are obscene,  grocery store not too bad.    The drinks in a pinapple at Ballards are very popular,  but watch out the pricing isnt listed clearly and they are around $40 each.

"If you are going on a weekend getting a car over is highly unlikely. As for restaurants the Spring House has a nice one also the 1661 and and hotel manisses. Here all next to your hotel. Nobody really dresses up. High end business casual is about the top end. Another great restaurant is Eli's but it's very small and difficult to get in do. There are many casual restaurants with a lot  of outdoor dining. The oar is nice to sit outside and watch the boats. It looks far away but is a nice 30 min walk.

It was a disaster. We got to Pt. Judith at 8:45 hoping to catch the 10 AM and ended up only being able to get on the 2 PM by the time we got to the front of the line.

"Also, round trip for a car is $80. It is super convenient if you can get reservations since you can load the car at home and unload it at the beach vs. parking in Pt Judith (about $15 per day/$80 week) and then lugging the cooler etc on to and off the boat.

Another advantage of a car is guaranteed passenger tickets for the boat. If going for a week it is  no brainier since parking in Pt Judith vs bringing the car is the same price.

"We were just there last weekend for a long 4th of July weekend, and we were there 2 weeks ago as well.  We came by sailboat and stayed on a mooring in Great Salt Pond.  There was a very big difference between the 2 visits, with a lot more activity over the holiday weekend.  The anchorage was packed with power boat rafts, and the marinas appeared to be at full capacity.  The dinghy dock at Dead Eye Dick's was full as was the dinghy dock at the Oar. Aldo's boat was not running 2 weeks ago, but was in full swing last weekend.  We ate twice at the Oar, which has expanded their outdoor dining.  We observed expanded outdoor dining at Dead Eye Dick's.  We didn't venture into town this time, but 2 weeks ago, most stores were open. The Surf was not, but a sign proclaimed it would open after we left, so I assume it's open now.  BI was generally a lot busier than I expected under the circumstances.

"Market experiences that are unique to BI. That would need coordination with local businesses that typically are closed off-season, but imagine a winter festival with horse drawn sleds along the beach or hiking Rodman's Hollow in the snow.

Christmas at the Spring House? A few bands, some local New England guest chefs, hands on cooking seminars, stuff like this would attract visitors. Play up the island's inherent qualities of remoteness, quiet, and natural beauty.

Maybe some winter writing seminars? A weekend with a favorite author in an authentic haunted BI hotel, workshopping with others interested in the same thing would be a great idea. 

Cross-country skiing tours of the island, for the more outdoorsy types, with hot chocolate made from scratch at a great vantage point along the bluffs?

"Best fishing spot in my opinion, is the jetty that is under the springhouse about 300 yards down the beach from Ballard’s. 

It’s only accessible during low tide however. As the waves can make it dangerous. A lot of success their late at night. 

2nd place is recommend is the coast guard channel as the bonito are running. However you would need a cab to access this area. 

As for swimming, mansion beach is one of the best, however it’s a hike to get too.  I’d personally recommend the beach pavilion because you shouldn’t have to deal with crowds this time of year. Ballard’s is great to swim too, I just walk down the beach to get away from the crowd.",t2_qmyfo,Cudpud,0,1567562721.0,0,t1_eyxub29,eyxub29,True,gamingaway,t3_cz9kjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockIsland/comments/cz9kjp/tips_for_visiting_the_island/,Tips for visiting the island?,/r/BlockIsland/comments/cz9kjp/tips_for_visiting_the_island/eyxub29/,2,r/BlockIsland,0,2

Hey! I worked for a summer on block island for the nature conservancy it was great! The cheapest way to get food is ordering through PeaPod which is a stop n shop program.

 I have taken both Uber and Lyft from Newport to Point Judith and from Point Judith to Newport several times, and it cost no more than $40 and took about 30-40 minutes. Lyft does not (to my knowledge) up their prices during busy times like Uber does. 

If you are going from Newport to Pt. Judith to catch the ferry to BI, make sure you check the boat schedules and give yourself at least an hour for travel time so you can make the ferry on time.

"My wife and I were married on the block and did so for not that much (maybe <$5K). We did it in mid-October, just past ""busy season"", which means a lot of places are closed, and weather is iffy, but the upshot is that rental houses can be found easily. We found a huge house that held 22 people for the wedding party, got married on the beach by the mayor (and got super lucky with the weather). 

Kimberly's gets a lot of catering recommendations but we didn't think her food was all that good.  We got a fancy cake from a place in Providence and it kicked ass.

The woman who owns the photo shop in old harbor (Photo Dog?) was our photographer and recommended the beach and a few other locations. She took photos of the ceremony and pics of the wedding party etc directly afterwards, saving time/money. The big old hotels like the Spring are cool, but you will pay.

“The Palatine Wreck” – Jill Farinelli, Author   
Two days after Christmas in 1738, a British merchant ship traveling from Rotterdam to Philadelphia grounded in a blizzard on the northern tip of Block Island. The ship carried emigrants from the Palatinate and its neighboring territories in what is now southwest Germany. The 105 passengers and crew on board—sick, frozen, and starving—were all that remained of the 340 men, women, and children who had left their homeland the previous spring. They now found themselves castaways, on the verge of death, and at the mercy of a community of strangers whose language they did not speak.   
Shortly after the wreck, rumors began to circulate that the passengers had been mistreated by the ship’s crew and by some of the islanders. The stories persisted, transforming over time as stories do, and in less than a hundred years, two terrifying versions of the event had emerged. These tales became known as the legend of the Palatine, the name given to the ship in later years, when its original name had been long forgotten.   
So how did the rumors begin? What really happened to the Princess Augusta and the passengers she carried on her final, fatal voyage? Through years of painstaking research, Jill Farinelli reconstructs the origins of one of New England’s most chilling maritime mysteries.",t2_9im9u,TheHoundsOFLove,0,1533657841.0,0,t1_e3rosgq,e3rosgq,True,TheHoundsOFLove,t3_95cwu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockIsland/comments/95cwu9/810_tour_of_palatine_graves_with_jill_farinelli/,"8/10- Tour of Palatine graves with Jill Farinelli, author of “The Palatine Wreck” – $25 4:00pm",/r/BlockIsland/comments/95cwu9/810_tour_of_palatine_graves_with_jill_farinelli/e3rosgq/,1,r/BlockIsland,0,1

"I go to Block Island lots.  Many times all summer.  I've always taken bikes.  It's the best.  It gives so much freedom. 
The ferry ride is about 1hr 15mins and it's always a nice ride.  I like to sit outside at the nose and on the island side for the views on the way.

The crowds are never too bad.  If you are a beach goer, go to Mansion Beach!  The best beach I have ever been on!  Blows away any other beach in Rhode Island and beyond!

My other favorite is Black Rock Beach.  You can go there and be by yourself.


The Oar, not too good.
Mohegan cafe is good.
Elis!  Awesome!
The Atlantic inn!  Great sunset, wine & food
For Lunch!  Old Post Office Bagel Shop! 


Secret!  If you have too much to lug around you can waltz right into the Harborside and walk straight back to a room and store your bags,  (even if not staying there)
My wife and I get there early, check in, leave our bags, and take off for the day to the beach.  We explore the island quite thoroughly with the bikes.
Make sure you have plenty of water for your bike rides.

"1) Go on a Monday or Tuesday, those days are less busy usually.

2) The ferry from Point Judith takes 1 hour on the big boat, half hour on the high speed. The high speed is $37.50 for a round trip while the big boat is $23.75

3) Only bring bkes if your ready for a workout because the block is one helluva hilly island. Also, it's a harrowing experience to ride a bike anywhere near town because of the narrow roads and high traffic. People have gotten seriously injured so be careful.

4) LOCK YOUR BIKE! IT WILL GET STOLEN! The police department even gives out free locks because bike thefts are so common. They also put signs on all the bike racks that say LOCK YOUR BIKES... so yeah, lock em up.

5) Take a taxi. if you'd rather not sweat around the island on a bike you could take a cab to go anywhere in new harbor or old harbor for $12, plus the drivers can tell you a lot about the island and the best spots to go. There's some quirky characters out there but if your polite they will usually open up and can be a hoot.

6) Go horseback riding at Rustic Rides. It's an experience you will not soon forget. You can get a guided trail ride for around $50 and the owner has all kinds of cool stories about the island and he's one of the most interesting and entertaining people you will ever meet.",t2_rqaxn,The_black_element,0,1503288221.0,0,t1_dlwt2mo,dlwt2mo,True,DoxRiskAccount,t3_6uqg2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlockIsland/comments/6uqg2n/planning_to_go_to_block_island_either_tomorrow_or/,Planning to go to Block Island either Tomorrow or Monday and have some questions.

"The ""town"" is right where you'll be landing- if you happen to land in the other harbor, it's a 15-20(?) minute walk or a 10 minute bike ride.

"I hardly see how getting a cab on block is a ""process"". You call, tell them where you are and a cab shows up. Also there's 32 cabs in total and they park all around town. I actually can see uber being more of a hassle. By the time you get the app open your bound to see a couple cabs drive by. An uber driver probly won't give a f**k about the island or know anything about it, plus uber drivers would contribute 0 to the local island economy which is only about 3 months (2 good ones). And we certainly don't need anymore traffic on the island ever since the ferry decided to lower the fees for bringing.a vehicle over so now everybody and their grandmother brings one over.
