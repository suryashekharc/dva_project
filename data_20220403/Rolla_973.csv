"I understand being introverted means what I'm about to say sounds insane, but 100% serious, the best way to branch out is to do just that. This is one of the best times in life to pick up a new hobby or interest. Having graduated just a few years ago, I realize that college is the most welcoming environment. People are out there literally just to meet new people. Personally, I joined GDI and casually participated in KMNR. 

GDI always met on campus although, I can't remember which room and where... They threw off campus parties and social outings (disc golf, fundraiser dinners), but the great thing about GDI is you can participate as little or as much as you want. I ended up in an elected position that I honestly enjoyed and learned a lot from. You can usually spot GDI members by their blue jackets, introduce yourself and they'll let you know when the next meeting is.

KMNR is kind of a different story, I got tight with a lot of the DJ's and occasionally was a guest speaker on some of their shows. So I wasn't officially a member, but they welcomed me anyway. It was really cool, and looking back, I wish I would have joined legitimately because I wanted to get more involved. Getting into KMNR takes a bit more work, there's an interview process that I personally don't know anything about. If they're ever on campus, stop and talk to one of the DJ's, otherwise, the station is pretty near campus (corner of N State and W 10th), you might get lucky and get to tour their record library (Not kidding, the record room is probably as large as my apartment).

"Hey! I graduated from S&T with two majors in four years. Doing so required extensive communication with department heads, counselors, etc. So I have gathered a bit of information on the process and its benefits/downfalls.

The short of it is that, like other commenters have said, there are very few situations where BS+BS makes more sense than BS+MS. If you are really enamored with both fields and are up for the workload, maybe. Even then it is a hard sell. It very rarely brings extra job opportunities, and for your situation (EE + business/systems) I think the time is just spent more efficiently by using the B.S. to get a broad understanding of the EE field and the M.S. to specialize in Eman. 

However, if you are set on BS+BS, I have a few pointers that I would like to give that I wish someone had given to me at the start.

1. **Make your ""four year"" plan now**. S&T has resources for figuring out the degree requirements for your two degrees. Make a schedule at the semester level which says exactly what you take, when you take it, and what requirements it ticks off. Try to pick classes which count for requirements in both degrees. Once you have this four year plan (and ideally many alternatives for when things go wrong), check in on it every semester.
2. **Get a good counselor**. You don't get much say in your first ones, but once you are in your department(s), make sure your counselor works with you to achieve this. A bad counselor can literally set you back by recommending bad classes.
3. **Get *really* good at time management**. You will inevitably be taking heavier course loads than your friends. In order to make it out alive you need to understand how to effectively use your time to tackle study/homework so that you can still have time to relax. 

Lastly,
>  I wanted to do like 9 or 10 semesters does that seem weird. Especially 9 semesters[...]

Go for it! But if I could offer some advice, most employers are going to value experience over two majors. You're generally going to be better off devoting your time to internships, design teams, etc.

"piggybacking on this other comment, Without a shadow of a doubt, as a CS graduate, GET IN AN INTERNSHIP BEFORE GRADUATING. its absolutely crucial.  


additionally, the CS department was going through some significant restructuring around the end of my time there, so the landscape may be different, but to put it simply its a solid program that focuses more on actual Computer Science, rather than just strict coding. A lot of jobs however only want coding, so you'll likely want to spend the time to pick up another programming language outside of class (C# and .net stuff comes to mind)

"The college: it is a great place to learn, but only if you know how to study and pace yourself. The burnout is pretty common if you don't. It is a small city so don't expect a million options for food or groceries. We have all the standard American fast food places and grocery stores. 

The department: it has been a while since I took a CS class but I have a few friends that are in the department. It can be frustrating at times, as with all departments, but it's a pretty solid program. According to a buddy of mine, it is one of the few places that actually teaches ""Computer Science"" rather than data/programming and calls it CS. You'll do data and programming but you'll also do operating system development, computer architecture, and databases. It is pretty good at churning out full stack developers that could also work in hardware. 

Curriculum: you can Google ""Missouri S&T Como Sci Curriculum"" and find it. 

Financial Aid: for an international student, I have no information, but a quick email to sfa@mst.edu should help. 

Internship: as part of the degree, you have to complete an experiential learning requirement, this can be on campus research, internship, coop, 2 semesters in a campus organization leadership position, etc. From my understanding, CS job placement is pretty high, so you're likely to find a job at graduation.

"I have twins, one attending Mizzou and the other attending S&T. 

S&T is more expensive when the lab fees for the engineering courses are added in. I don’t know if CS classes have those fees, but Mizzou is costing less after those fees are considered.

"For computer science, both will do you just fine. S&T will be cheaper, so it will have a better value to you. Engineering is where S&T really stands out. Mizzou is a fine computer science school.

Apart from that, understand you are comparing a school of 6,000 in a town of 20,000 to a school of 30,000 in a town of 120,000. When you are comparing things that aren't strictly academically or financially related, you aren't going to come up with S&T being the superior option.

Boredom really depends on what you are in to. If you are into the bar scene, Rolla has gone so downhill the past many years. The only ""bar"" left downtown is Hoppers. Hoppers is not a bar. Hoppers is a mediocre restaurant with lots of beer options. There is nothing to do there but sit around in a brightly lit room and talk. There isn't even a pool table. The Locker Room sucks now in its new location. The only decent bar left is not within walking distance, and is mostly a townie regular bar. Compare that to Broadway street in Columbia and it is just depressing, honestly.

Greek life at Mizzou is probably the best Greek experience in the nation. Homecoming started there. Greek life at S&T isn't bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it is just unfair to compare the two. It isn't even close. 

If you like major sports, it isn't even close. If you're a guy and you like girls, it isn't even close. The ""Rolla ratio"" is a real term.

The only real reason to choose S&T for computer science is if you want more value for your degree (S&T is cheaper to complete) and your free time is mostly spent doing things indoors.

I found S&T to be a very fulfilling experience due to the people I met and what we were up to, but I was also almost 30 when I came here. I had calmed down -a lot-. There were some legitimately good bars when I got here as well.

Any questions?

"Firstly, on the topic of student life at S&T: it takes a lot of work to attend school here, which can be stressful. However, getting involved in things is a great way to both relive stress during your time on campus as well as have some fun to avoid boredom. From the design teams, various clubs, our Greek and non-Greek Orgs and even just meeting new people, it’s a great living experience. Not to mention that St. Pats is a wild ride lasting 9 days.

Alternatively: living in Rolla specifically certainly requires either a desire to rather exclusively stay on campus and vibe, or a creative mind in terms of things to do. 

To counter my last point: the downtown area is pretty neat with plenty of shops and restaurants to check out, we do have a theater, arcade, skating rink, bowling alley and I’m pretty sure a couple other things. 

As you stated, S&T is known for its engineering degrees (most people recommend taking math elsewhere and transferring the credits over just as a heads up). Based on the stats that I’ve seen most S&T students do wind up with a job soon after graduating and many with internships while students. 

Needless to say: college, no matter where you go, is all about the perspective YOU choose to have. The perspective you go into it with, go through it with, and leave it with. If you want to come to school in Rolla and get a good degree, cool, awesome. More power to you. But if you want more out of it than just that, you have to want to have fun as well.

"It’s a pretty good school but it was a very difficult experience for me to get through honestly. I graduated this December. 

The classes are honestly made unreasonably difficult because of generally poor teaching and a lack of cohesion combined with exams that are absurdly difficult compared to the class material. Not to mention that a ton of people use files and cheat which skews the curve and fucks over people who actually do the work ethically. 

There aren’t many artsy or creative types here and frankly the entire S&T community is incredibly dismissive of the arts in my experience. It’s rough if that’s part of your identity or you have a creative passion. 


The dating scene is completely nonexistent if you’re a guy. So if dating is a part of your “outlet” or “college experience”, its unlikely it’s gonna happen in rolla. 

The town completely sucks and offers virtually nothing. There is a huge drug problem and it’s really depressing and sad. 

So if you’re number one priority is getting the absolute best grades possible and the best degree for the money then definitely consider S&T. However if life experiences, growing as a person, dating, parties, living somewhere cool, etc. are really important to you during this time in your life….then i would look elsewhere. 

You can get a great engineering degree elsewhere without suffering any of the numerous. downsides of rolla. Just make sure you consider all your options. 

If you still are considering rolla i would say:

VISIT THE CAMPUS. This is crucial 

And during the visit, introduce yourself to some students who aren’t affiliated with your tour and maybe see if they’ll grab lunch with you or talk about the pros and cons. Maybe talk to a couple different students so you have a few perspectives. Then see what you think. And definitely get a hotel so you can check out the town and see if you could tolerate it for four years. 

Not trying to discourage you from this school but it has serious cons that are largely avoidable by going to other schools that provide a higher quality of life anyway.

"Currently I'm a freshman so I'll say a little bit about how I've felt so far. Overall, I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything like if I had gone to Mizzou or some other Missouri school, and I even live in Columbia so Mizzou would've been huge in saving money. I've gone to a few parties for both Mizzou and MST and I'll say MU has bigger and higher energy but MST you'll likely just have a straight up good time and don't have to worry about overcrowding. I've gotten a pretty good group of friends so far that are a solid mix of all years including grad and undergrad students. No matter what event or social gathering you go to, you'll likely find plenty of people to chill with, so far I haven't really run into anyone who thinks they or their friend group is too good for anyone else, it's all been super inviting. Things to do around here are fairly limited but like someone else said, plenty of nature to explore and if you really gotta do something then Columbia, Springfield, and St. Louis are all only about 1.5 hours away plus anything else in between. For classes, I've been stuck mostly on the pre-req classes like Calc 1, Chem, intro to engineering, econ, etc. I'll say that in HS while taking all honors and AP at times I was able to cruise through and not do much HW or studying and stayed above a 3.5 GPA pretty easily, and coming here I've gone from Mayne 3 hours a week on hw for HS to around 2-3 hours a day doing everything legitimately and not just looking up answers. For any exam in any class, I'll have to study for about 2-3 hours for the two days before the exam and doing all that got me a 3.4 GPA first semester and it should get me close to a 3.6 this semester because my classes are a bit easier. If you had to study a ton in HS to get good grades, you'll have to keep it up here and if you didn't study at all in HS to get good grades then you'll have to really change up your regiment but it's not that bad. I'm extremely lazy and I'm likely gonna manage a double major in less than 5 years so academically it's not that tough, but employers love students from here. I have an older friend who is a Junior at Mizzou this year for engineering and he had a rough time trying to find an internship for this summer and he didn't get one last year. Here, you can sneeze just right at the career fair as a sophomore and likely end up with at least some kind of relevant internship. Following through with your degree here will get you where you want to be. You'll have to try and higher level classes are probably gonna suck but it's all manageable. I'm glad I chose to come here over Mizzou or any other Missouri school for engineering and I have no regrets thus far.

"Hopefully this helps! I’m a female student at MS&T and have been at the school three years but lived in Rolla for four as I took a gap year for covid. 

MS&T is one of those schools where if you want to be a certain major, you really have to be committed. The pre-req work is extremely tough and will absolutely beat the shit out of you if you are going into any engineering. The classes try so hard to weed out the students who aren’t as smart or hard working as the others. You must be the best of the best or willing to work harder than everyone else here. Pre-req professors in my experience, don’t give a shit about you. Once you find your department, all that changes. Just keep in mind, classes are extremely tedious and of high skill level here.

On college life, this all depends if you find your place. I’ve personally had my best experiences at MS&T due to my organization. They have helped me through school and kept me having fun and getting out enough as well. My organization is 4 North which is non-Greek and not official by the means of the school. 

This leads to parties. If you are going Greek, there are plenty of parties to attend, but to the other people who that does not fit, there are other options. The first is St. Pat’s board gatherings which is almost exclusively St. Pat’s board and only close people invited. One of my roommates is on the board and despite how tough it is, it is something he will always enjoy. The second options for parties is GDI. This year they have not hosted any parties, but I believe they are going to try again next year. Third is 4 North which to my knowledge is the only active association throwing parties. There is currently a party just about every weekend. 

Rolla is not particularly great. Student housing, once you get out of the dorms is rough. The townies have even broken into my car and stolen my purse. Sometimes they just go through the trash randomly as well. I’ve had townies follow me on campus at night where I’ve had to call someone to let them know where I was and stand near an emergency button. I’ve seen townies doing drugs outside of TJ. I also live across the street from campus, not even in the worst neighborhood. 

There isn’t much to do in Rolla. You really have to make your own fun here. If you are into nerdier stuff, it is a lot easier to find stuff to do outside of class and there are actually lots of sport options even if you don’t want to put much time into it. Design teams can also take up a lot of time but are really rewarding. 

Now here are some of my main issues with MS&T. The math department for anything lower than Calc 2 is living hell. Do your math credits somewhere else, literally anywhere else. Second is the counseling. I’ve only ever had extremely bad situations with the counseling. If you struggle with mental health, get a therapist outside of campus. I haven’t met one student who had genuinely been helped my the student counseling center. Third is feeling safe as a woman on campus. I don’t know you are a guy, girl, or non-binary, but campus at times can feel extremely unsafe for woman. Sometimes they are really good about safety and sometimes not so much. It’s a 50/50 if you get help, and that can be really scary.",t2_6xjd36dw,funnycatlovrr,0,1644851380.0,0,t1_hwwyo7j,hwwyo7j,True,Clean-Conflict9059,t3_ss2pj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rolla/comments/ss2pj4/prospective_student/,Prospective Student,/r/Rolla/comments/ss2pj4/prospective_student/hwwyo7j/,4,r/Rolla,0,4
"I've been here for a minute (5 years this spring), so I'll do my best to give an accurate representation of campus/student life.

Socially it can feel a little quiet, especially if you're expecting the ""big college"" experience with lots of parties and drinking at bars. Big parties do happen here and they're for sure fun, but there's usually only one going on on any given weekend. You tend to see the same people at parties which makes for a nice community though. I've made lots of friends this way. The greek community here, while I am not apart of it, is excellent and not like most other greek communities. A large percentage of students here are greek, and they tend to be pretty great people. If you're not into that there's other social orgs on campus, some religious based, there's the campus radio station KMNR, and like fifty others I'm not listing here. Most of my lasting connections have been through clubs and shared classes, which is a nice segue...

Speaking of classes... S&T is an incredible place to learn and really digest your major. Once you get past the nasty pre-reqs the courses here are typically high quality and fascinating. This varies by department but most professors I've had have been brilliant and willing to explain concepts that you aren't understanding. For smaller programs this is even more true. Even the pre-reqs have a ton of resources available to help get you through the homework slog of Freshman-Sophomore years. Other students are a valuable resource, too. Ask an old person. They'll have notes for you.

As for Rolla itself. Blah. There's some cool stores downtown, like Runcible and Eclipse if you're into boardgames and TTRPGs and a phenomenal middle eastern grocery store cafe. But bars? There's like three bars in town and they tend to cater to a more ""townie"" base in my experience. Hopper's tends to be where the students gather. 

The real fun here is the closeness to nature here. Camping your thing? Sick, there's tons of national forest land for you to explore. Climbing? Devil's Elbow is a nice crag. Mountain biking? Sure. Backpacking? Yeah baby. The Ozarks are dummy beautiful and I cannot stress how rewarding it is to explore the hills around here. If you have a car make sure to get out and take some aimless drives and see what you find. For more fun, bring a geology major to explain the gorgeous rocks we have around here!

"One time I decided to humor the idea. Best case I get a new tv, worst case I lose a few hours of my life.

"Maybe the doctors' ones are PCR tests?  The insurance plans are sending out at-home rapid tests, like the ones sold at Walgreens or CVS for $10/test.  They're also called lateral flow assay tests, and look similar to pregnancy tests.  If anyone tests positive on a rapid test, then they should go to a testing site to get a PCR test to verify the result.  PCR tests are expensive (over $100) but insurance (or the federal government if uninsured) will pay for them.

PCR test results are the official proof that you had COVID.  Make sure that result is entered into your medical record, because without a diagnosis on record you might not qualify for long COVID or PASC care later if you need it.   There's more to COVID than just getting through the initial infection.

The at-home kits are easy to do, and take about 15 minutes.  Here are examples:

"Here's some context:  


I used to be a public school teacher in the Rolla area. I made $34K working 11 hour days, dealing with people who made every excuse for apathy, poor performance, and the like.  On top of teaching, coaching kids through ups and downs, I worked to bring in hundreds of thousands of dollars of grant funding for the district on my own time outside of the 11 hour days, because I wanted to make it better.  


Once COVID hit and I was required to be in person as a teacher while having a kid with a compromised immune system, I moved out of my home and back with my parents so that I could keep my kids safe (parents also had to be in person for their jobs). I missed birthdays, and had my two year old saying I could not get too close when outside because of the sickness. I sacrificed to keep my family afloat.  


The skills I developed of my own initiative allowed me to leave public ed, find a remote job, return home, and dang near triple my salary. Did I work over 40 hours a week for 6 weeks when starting, due to too small a staff and processes being created with growth? Yeah! But it was not 16 hour days, and compared to teaching and the work I was doing, I STILL gained time back.  


And now? I am hovering around 35-45 hrs a week, and my quality of life emotionally and financially has skyrocketed.   


I will say it again: I **am not privy to the salary range**. I can say that we have career engineers on staff already who live in Silicon Valley, and have for years and are middle aged. I assume they would not be able to live there if the numbers did not work out. But no, I do not have a number. Sorry.  


That doesn't mean I'm trying to be deceptive, or rely on 'slave labor'. If you don't want to apply, fine! Feel free to peruse jobs as you feel is expedient for you.

* Where is the job based, or is it fully remote? 
* What sort of benefits packages are available, and does the company have a program to pay some or all of the expenses for continuing education (e.g. master's degree, professional certs)?

"[https://missouriindependent.com/2022/01/28/covid-rural-hospital-icu-patient](https://missouriindependent.com/2022/01/28/covid-rural-hospital-icu-patient)""COVID surge forced rural Missouri hospital to build makeshift ICU for dying patient. Using gear purchased from Walmart, staff saved woman’s life when it couldn’t find an ICU bed at larger hospital.   


For six days, Dr. Mohamed Nabeel Kuziez and his team at a small emergency room in southeastern Missouri did everything they could to keep a 67-year-old woman with severe pneumonia alive.  
  
The day after Kathie Ganime was admitted on Jan. 12, Kuziez saw that her infection was so critical that she needed to be transferred from Madison Medical Center — a 15-bed hospital in Fredericktown — to an intensive care unit (ICU) at a larger hospital.   
  
But after calling 19 hospitals — in Missouri, Kansas, Illinois and Arkansas — the staff at Madison Medical Center couldn’t find a single open ICU bed due to the surge in COVID-19 patients. In just the first 12 days of the year, Missouri hospitals admitted 1,065 people with COVID-19, and new admissions were averaging 116 per day over the previous week.""

"I am currently looking for a roommate
Right now, I am renting a 3 bedroom 2 bath house that is about 6years old and on ~1acre of land in a small neighborhood.
It's less than a 15min drive from campus, and located very close to loin's club park.

The total cost of rent for the house is $900/mo plus ~$225/mo for all utilities, so splitting evenly between two people it would be ~$563/mo.

Some info about me:
I am physics PhD student and I have been living at this house for about 4 years now, but I've been living in Rolla for almost 10years so I'm fairly well aquatinted with Rolla. I'm also a maintenance manager for a horse rescue so, should you have any car trouble, I can likely fix it or direct you to a cheap and reliable repair shop.

"In response to the antimaskers/antivaxxers/antisciencers: you don't know what you don't know.  There's more to COVID than the acute phase of the infection.

1) There is no herd immunity that eliminates infections, since variants keep changing.  Some people have been infected three or four times already. 

2) This virus gets everywhere-- in almost every organ including the brain.  It enters any cell with an ACE2 receptor, which is most. It's system wide. 

3) It can form microclots and other hidden damage even in mild cases, and at all ages.

4) This virus may have weird immune-modifying properties affecting T-cells.  Research is trying to figure this out but they need more time.

5) The damage of iterative infections may be cumulative.

6) A mild first case can be followed with a hospitalized second case. Subsequent infections aren't always milder.

7) The longterm effects of infection over coming decades are unknown, but research is troubling (see: alpha-synuclein aggregation, Lewy body formation in macaque monkeys, neuroinflammation and Alzheimers).

8) The virus has been found in tissues in quantity for months after the acute phase, just hanging out. The immune system isn't always kicking it.

9) Immunity to upper-respiratory coronaviruses seems to wane which might mean that we aren't generating the right kind of lasting immunity to some of the upper respiratory variants, including maybe the Omicron branch.  

10) This virus has a superantigen region which tricks immune T-cells into attacking normal tissue. 

11) In some cases the virus appears to cause an infected cell to attach to a  neighboring cell to infect it directly.  This means it avoids the bloodstream, so antibodies can't attack it. 

12) PASC aka long COVID is a real risk. People have been forced to quit their jobs or leave college due to brain fog, exhaustion, and other problems. Cognition often declines.

13) The more human bodies host the virus, the more chances it has for new mutations that could increase severity or transmissibility. 

14) It's bad for the economy for people to get sick over and over again, and to have a sizable percentage of people with PASC after each surge.  It's cheaper and easier for everyone to be fully vaccinated and to increase our routine infection-control measures. 

------

COVID isn't a one-and-done, get it once and forget it kind of thing.  

We should reduce infections while we wait for better therapeutics and/or a universal vaccine and/or mucosal vaccines. Many are in the pipeline. Impatient people don't get to decide for the rest of us that it's over. 

During surges be careful: Get fully vaxxed (right now that means all 3 shots) as this is the easiest way to avoid severe infection and reduce, but not eliminate, problems like PASC. Avoid crowds. Get takeout instead of eating in. Use a KN95 or N95 around people. Ventilate rooms or use a HEPA filter. Meet outside or online when possible.

"Rolla's own TDD page says otherwise: the roundabout was specifically requested by the University.  MODOT and FWHA advised a traffic signal at that location. It was the University that wanted the roundabout, and so it provided the difference in costs between a traditional intersection and the roundabout, and thus it was approved.  [http://moverollatdd.com/university-drive-realignment/](http://moverollatdd.com/university-drive-realignment/)  

Apparently the City will then 'give' the old taxpayer funded University Drive to the University for use as a sidewalk.  The city is also planning to give 63 a road diet; reduce the number of lanes in each direction, add medians between the lanes, and a bike/pedestrian path using one of the old lanes.

"I know the question was already answered, but just so you know the Lodges is a managed network. So they themselves block port forwarding outside of it. So you can put forward your router and open your apartment network to other apartments (if you have friends in a different unit at the Lodges or something) but without a linking service like hamachi you can't grant access from outside the lodges.

"> who is on the board, and the gossip around town

i'm not in town anymore, just had this pop up on my feed so got interested. So, I'm not up on the gossip. You or someone's anonymous alt should totally share the gossip. That's how action happens, when people start openly spreading details and talking about it. For now, without that, this accusing post just produces outrage with no where to grow a solution.

And I just figured since your post was predicated on 'drug addiction and low income"" that you might actually be making the time to look ""at the budget for what those percentages are"" with regard to policing and support. 

The services you mentioned are absolutely what many (not all) the foks supporting ""defund the police"" are calling for as a shifting of budget from enforcement to societal support services. So maybe you should look at the movement again and realize ""defund"" isn't the same as ""abolish"".",t2_4aopw,BrotherChe,0,1639879100.0,0,t1_hp49ue5,hp49ue5,False,SmedleyButler_,t3_rjhzct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rolla/comments/rjhzct/while_many_in_the_town_of_rolla_suffer_from_drug/,"While Many in The Town of Rolla Suffer From Drug Addiction and Low Income, Your Tax Dollars Are Being Used to Purchase Brand New Police Vehicles at a Massively Inflated Price!

"Are there any ""defund the police"" related initiatives in town? Funding for alternative policing and community support services? I think it'd be more effective to address these police expenditures in relation to the percentage spent on support services, not simply shout down their attempt to fund the department's current tasks. It needs to be examined as a community safety unified budget, and study effectiveness and constituent desires and expectations.

"Not sure dealers consider a 5 car purchase bulk, though it should warrant some kind of discount, especially for a state bid. 

35k is probably baseline, and undoubtedly they won't be basline models, even if it's just some of the common basic enhancements. So for 2022 vehicles with a few enhancements, some of which might be necessary for police vehicle status, I'd figure $36k a piece isn't too bad in the middle of a chip shortage.

I agree they should certainly consider delaying till after chip shortage -- BUT two things.

One, we don't know when that will be. I'm in IT and I've heard estimates it could last thru to 2024.

Two, goes back to my points in the prior posts -- what are current annual maintence costs and state of the vehicles.

Oh, and one thing to consider, this could be a perfect time to sell older vehicles at a markup. I think this should have been required to have been included in total cost estimates of new vehicles. Where & to whom might these vehicles go and what are the estimated resale values and conditions.

"Does the Rolla Daily News have a ""Letter to the Editor"" section? Might be worthwhile to question it publicly, but be sure to go in with details.

---


$36,041 per 2022 Durango for 5 of them [Landmark Dodge of Independence] which they said was 11% lower bid than the local dealer) -- this is a state bid.

MSRP $35,475 - $66,275

$28,999 for 2021 police Dodge charger - [Behlman Dodge of Troy] - police car in place of existing Durango that could instead be put on the street.

MSRP $31,125 - $79,725 standard non-police

$59,329 for outfitting the new vehicles for police use Public Safety Upfitters. [That's ~$10,000 per vehicle, which is pretty standard](https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2015/09/12/cost-keeping-wheels-turning-police-cruisers/72144510/)

$17,122 headsets, which is a $3,000 increase of original bid but is within previous budgeting allowance for radios and headsets ($715,000) -- replacing 12 year old units that they attempted to trade-in but were not desired.

$22,243 for tactical vests panels - 5 year expiration so must replace, and these are an upgrade


----

So, the prices don't seem inflated at all. I suppose the question is whether they really need to replace their vehicles -- how long were the prior ones in service? What were the annual maintenance costs versus replacement?

I totally get the concern about law enforcement expenditure outpacing community services directly to the people. 

And it would be useful to know of any connection between the council and the bid-winning companies.

Otherwise, it's tough to see this as anything corrupt.

"Pick the DBD meal plan. Trust me.

Memorize your student ID number when you get one or write it down in an easily accessible place. 


Get a strong and durable umbrella. Rolla gets surprisingly windy and I saw more than a few umbrellas get tossed in the garbage after breaking beyond repair.


If you get sick, go to Student Health and ask for a note to excuse you from class if needed. Take a picture/scan of the note and email it to your professors. That's mostly if you're missing a test or will suffer some other sort of point loss. Also your tuition automatically pays for most of Student Health, so exploit it whenever needed. Bandaids, Neosporin, ibuprofen, numbing cough drops, and other basic stuff will be provided for ""free"" because of that. They can also write referrals to the nearby hospital. I got a chest x-ray for I think $30? 


Don't be afraid of visiting the Counseling and Disability services and/or the CARE Coordinator for academic accomodations. If you're living in the dorms, your RA can probably help point you in the right direction. These accomodations can include extra time for exams, taking exams in the testing center instead of in class (it's quieter and less crowded in there), and sometimes flexible deadlines, among other things. It took a load of stress off me to have those options. Some professors are nice and will work with you regardless, if you communicate. Some are...not nice though.


Be ready for group chats with your classmates. They are helpful, especially with notes. My French class even had a collective Google Doc of notes. Some people also (allegedly) have access to files of previous assignments and exams in some classes (allegedly) from previous students (allegedly), which are nice for at least studying purposes...allegedly. 


Assuming you're living in the dorms, RAs can be very helpful resources, so don't be afraid to ask your RA about anything once you meet them. I was one a few years ago, so I can answer some questions with decently reliable information if you (or anyone) ever want to DM me. I still have the guidebook somewhere at least. You can probably find an RA behind the doors with a copious amount of name tags on them. 


Btw to students in the dorms: if you ever have an RA knock on your bathroom stall or something and ask if everything is alright on a weekend night, they do it because they have to. It's part of a duty round. Just say you're fine (if you are indeed fine) and everyone can move on.

"I am not part of the physics department - I'm here for IT - but I believe it's a great college that's highly regarded and I think you'd fit right in, especially under physics.
Employment is available in Rolla through S&T and plenty of other places, though most internships/co-ops you'll find are not in Rolla and are in places like St Louis or Kansas City which are about 2 hours out in opposite directions. Like someone else said - I'd recommend getting a car as things are pretty spread out in Rolla and most of your opportunities will be outside of Rolla. 
Another thing about employment is that big employers like having S&T students apparently and there is a career fair about every semester. Tons of opportunities to find an internship/co-op as long as you look around enough.
Living expenses as a freshman/sophomore can be high due to a requirement of living on campus until you're a junior.

Join a design team. With your major you have a large choice. Most teams need coding and CAD work done. Lots of potential benefits to joining a design team.

If you need medical care, the Student Health Center is west of campus on 10th street. If you need something more serious than your ears cleaned out, there is an Immediate Care Clinic by Wal-Mart that is a cheaper option than the ER. The Community Care Center is the cheapest place, especially if you are uninsured. 

You can try greek life but they waste a shit load of your time doing stupid stuff like hitting the ground with a stick because it's St. Pat's week. Or carving trees. Mandatory meetings you get nothing out of. There are perks, though. Mostly social perks. With the bar scene these days that alone probably makes it worth it.

"I can't really say anything about the physics department or internships for physics, but many foreign exchange students do come to S&T for their MS.  As for employment in town, finding a job should be relatively easy, as long as you're open to do most jobs.  I would recommend finding a car if you do decide to attend S&T, because Rolla is spread out.  You can walk to anywhere in town, but you'll usually be better off finding an apartment on the outskirts of town where rent is cheaper and driving wherever you need to go.  As for living expenses, I'm paying $400 for rent, but that could be as high as $800, and $100-$200 for groceries a month should be enough for anyone.

I actually started out at Embry-Riddle in Arizona. Went there for two years and then transferred to S&T. Was over hyped in my opinion. EE program is much better at S&T and so are the design clubs. It's also stupid expensive and has no good graduate programs. One of the big benefits of S&T over Embry-Riddle is that I'm able to take graduate classes while still an undergrad which has been really great. There is also almost no research at Embry-Riddle so if you want to be a research assistant its almost impossible but I spent a year in a professors lab at S&T which looks great on my resume. Overall I would recommend S&T.

You don’t have to take any time off of school to get in state tuition. You have to file taxes in the state of Missouri and make I think around $7000 in the state. You have to be able to provide proof of residence in the state for the full year (an apartment lease) and you have to get a Missouri license. They require you also provide proof you were physically there so they ask for your bank statement and you have to use your card in state every couple of days and minimal out of state charges.

"As a Phelps County native who left for a spell and returned, I happily voted ""Yes, I wouldn't mind a pride parade,"" although ""wouldn't mind"" is probably understating my view. If the LGBTQ+ community in the area wants a pride parade, then I as a straight dude would support that and tell anyone who complained about it where they could go with their complaints. 

Now, I can understand why the LGBTQ+ community in Rolla might not want to have a pride parade. Parades are a hassle to put on and to coordinate. You have to get permits and pay for the police to close off streets. Given our comparatively low population, if you hold a parade you're liable to only to have few people participating in it, and it's not like there's apt to be a bunch of spectators watching it, either. A parade is great for visibility if you can pull one off, but it's hard to pull off a good parade in a small town. It's much easier to just rent a pavilion in a park and have a nice party (which I think maybe happened based on the other comments), so I'm not surprised that there haven't been pride parades in the past and am not going to think the worst if there isn't one next year, either.

Finally, I 100% know that there would be some loud objections to any sort of pride parade in Rolla, but if my hillbilly family is any indication (and it usually is) a strong majority of the population would be somewhere on the ""wouldn't mind"" to ""strongly supports"" spectrum.

"Lived in the Schuman Park area for over 20 years. In 2017, no issues at all… even into 2018.  It started getting bad a couple of years ago, and has been getting progressively worse in the last two years.  The city park is supposed to closer at midnight, and there isn’t supposed to be any camping there, but there are more transients hanging there lately.  Yes, it seems to be connected with the Mission opening and other communities sending their homeless to Rolla to try to get their services.  We’ve had issues with people getting into the trash in our dumpster and stealing stuff out of our front yard.   We see more and more people dragging suitcases wandering through. 

We have added cameras, asked for extra patrols.    
Please, whenever there is a disturbance, call the cops.

"Oh no that’s freaky! Be careful. I’ve had people there yell and ask if I “knew the time” as well. It’s a common thing apparently. It happened multiple times to me so naturally I became curious and researched it and that is usually a way to distract people to lower their guard so the person can determine if it’s worth the trouble to jump or rob you (or signal their friends to do it). Since it was late, It’s certainly possible you were in danger but the person decided it wasn’t worth it and left you alone.
