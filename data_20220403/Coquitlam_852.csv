"You'll need your WSI even though it's a transition period right now from Red Cross to the [Lifesaving Society.](https://www.lifesaving.org/courses-and-programs/red-cross-swim-transition)

Even though it's not posted, keep looking at the City of Coq website and build your account/profile. You should have your awards (NL Pool, CPR-C/SFA with AED, and WSI). If you haven't got WSI experience, definitely volunteer to see how Swim classes are taught. It's one thing to plan/set up the classes, but it's a whole nother ball game teaching a parent and tot/pre-school class.

Look at getting other certifications (e.g. Lifesaving Instructor, Aquafit). If you can get your Aquafit, you'll be able to pick your shifts.

I would highly recommend taking an LSI course with the City of Burnaby, as their instructor, Karen Hillmann, is highly experienced and knowledgeable.

P.S part of why the strata is so high is so they can keep contributing to their contingency fund.

"Lol...Riddle me this, after two years, the science has shown these mandates and their benifits DIDNT outweigh the negatives of them. 

Maybe you're fine with a show me your papers society. So, how are the unvaxxed spreading covid when they can't go anywhere? Now, it's fully vaxxed, which I am (two shots), who are spreading covid. 

Making people having to get the jab to keep their job is fucked up. Now, I can seea private business doing that for NEW hires, but already employed...fucked up. 

Do you want to live in a country that has two tiers of people? That requires you to have papers to eat a burger at a restaurant? What about the freedom of businesses to decide wether they mandate masks or not? Do you need to be told to do something to do it? No one is saying DONT wear a mask. No one is saying you can't self isolate. Go right ahead. The time now, if for learning to live with covid. The next 10 years we will be dealing with the repercussions  of these mandates. 

Your fear shouldn't dictate my freedom; PERIOD. You wanna live in fear....you're free to. Don't demand I do the same. The vax doesn't stop spread or infection. So why, then are these mandates in place? Why is a booster needed for a virus, that wasn't made for the mutations to come? Why is asking these questions deemed anti vax?

Why are left wing protests all good? Yet, any right of center protest is demonised? Fringe group? You really think it'sa fringe protest? BLM and antifa spent a whole summer burning parts of cities. They also blocked traffic. They disrupted flow of traffic etc. They made noise. Did you say, enough is enough? I'm gonna assume no. I thought the left was about the working class. They always say, they stand up for the poor and working class. Yet, here is a working class protest of ALL types of people and lwfites are furious. Who do you think ensures you clowns get your avocado toast and oranges in winter?

The freedoms lost are bodily autonomy, freedom of movement, discrimination based on health/medical history. Mental health destoyed. Kids fucked right over....and guess what...it's still spreading.

"For $50 an exterminator visit, I try getting a few dozen [of these affordable packages](https://www.homedepot.ca/product/victor-easy-set-mouse-trap-4-pack-/1000729823) to continue your DIY for a few weeks.  If it does not work out, then get the exterminator.  In my experience, the exterminator will use snap traps for indoors anyways.

Put some bait (peanut butter?) in the a few corners.  Then surround the baited corner with snap traps like a massive mine field of a dozen traps.  You only need the peanut button on the one last trap in the corner to the rodent get past the [other traps placed tightly next to one another](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2hjeC_PoYw&t=6m37s).

* Rodents like to follow along walls to corners.  Having your bait in corners will the increase the likelihood of a quick catch.

* Are there passages between boxes or appliances?  Fill those passages with a few snap traps.  It may see one trap and trip to hop over, when in the air it will be too late to react to the second and third trap.

* there's a reason why traps are sold in sealed packages.  You want to wear gloves when setting traps to minimize human scent.

* security cameras like Wyze are very handy to monitor traps and rodent activity around the traps.

* while the Victor paddle snap traps has been the most successful with me, I mix and match trap types to keep the mice confused.

Mice often travel is packs.  By increasing the number of traps, you will likely catch the buddies when they come to investigate their caught friend.  Shawn has some great ideas...

These people are dangerous if you don‚Äôt believe me I don‚Äôt blame you there‚Äôs so much diss information on both sides but I feel I need to tell people that there is a def risk of violence so they don‚Äôt make the same mistake I did trying to basically protest against there use of terry fox the media and police shouldn‚Äôt portray this as peaceful because it can get violent in an instant and people who are reasonable like me think there will be back and for Discussion or at most rabble rousing but these people are reasonable at all I Bet they are funded fully by trump and people like that I don‚Äôt like the mandates and I don‚Äôt want truckers to loose Their jobs but how is them blocking the border and attacking me make them any different then the exact people and mandates they are trying to stop you can‚Äôt solve one problem with another problem all this shit is for nothing I wouldn‚Äôt care if they took away the mandate but I do care if people think they can group up and attack people like a pack of wild hyenas what ever happened to a good old 1 on 1 fight I had 2 guys attack me and groups on all side of me standing in wait how is that freedom how does that help civilians they are just making my life worse I didn‚Äôt vote for mandates I didn‚Äôt like them I only got the vaccines after a year and a half of my own personal observation of people who were around me unvaccinated getting sick or even dying and the ones who were vaccinated were fine at that point I trusted in science and statistics that I myself observed because I didn‚Äôt trust the officials off the bat I still don‚Äôt fully but I trust my doctor and legal workers more then I would trust a group of people who instantly attack anyone who disagrees .

It sucks you were attacked. But the comparison was truly poor. My old polish neighbors who literally escaped the USSR would shake their heads at you.

It's also not uncommon at protests. When you get a mob of people, even just passerbys get overwhelmed. Add in a few words and it gets hostile.

People seem to largley agree with BLM protests yet ignore the absolute mayhem that occurs. People were getting stomped on for saying the wrong thing.

Even tho putting a sign on Terry Fox is little the last thing we need to worry about right now.. if it offended some people it should be addressed.

"Because the issues of the present are not road names. 

They're First Nation self-government inefficiencies. These guys love the fact people keep digging up the skeletons in the closet. They can continue to hide from fixing the present issues that face First Nations people.

You know why First Nations people always seem to be having issues? 

It's not the Government of Canada not giving them enough money for their social programs and development.

It's their own tribal governments that receive the money and never spend it on their people. 

These trivial issues that are brought up continue to help them, ""Blame the white man."" When in reality, most First Nations people living on reserves are being fucked over by their own.

I've worked on several reserve projects. Particularly, three schools. Out of the three only 1 ever completed. The other 2 suddenly cancelled when the money from the GoC hit the tribal governments bank account. It's a beautiful tech college in Mt. Currie. That reserve seems keen on helping develop it's people. 

Now that was just a few projects, imagine years of neglect, promises and more promises. Then when nothing happens, they simply say, ""Oh the GoC is fucking us over again."" And they believe it, while the tribal government administrators get fat.

Go take a first aid and self defence class then.

How would that work when one person is 115 lbs vs a 220 pounder?
 A gun is an equalizer. Many times, simply brandishing it is enough. There are far more defensive uses of firearms that save lives than people going around and murdering people. 

How about you need to first get your RPAL. Then take a course and show profiency with your firearm. Then you get a permit. Works in Czech. I'd rather thugs be scared of everyone, than the other way around. 

America isn't the standard we should use. Czech and Italy are. 

Here's a question. Should castle doctrine be law in Canada? Someone breaks into your home, armed ....should you go to jail if you shoot them?

"I'm not very familiar with that area but just as a general ""bear aware"" note... black bears are typically safe to be around as long as you don't accidentally get between a mother and her cubs or do something very dumb like try to pet them (have stopped a tourist from doing that believe it or not) BUT... if you are running, a good rule to remember is ""only prey runs away"". So if you come upon one suddenly and you're not sure about the situation, face them, make noise, and slowly walk away backwards. If they follow you, get real loud and try to buddy up with another human (for a black bear this may be aggressive behavior). Lastly, if they charge you, it's almost certainly a bluff charge to see if you'll run... so you hold your ground and think about what a badass you're going to be when you tell the story. :)

"Conditions are subject to change.  Overall the trail was mostly dry until you get to the upper elevations.  Specifically, when I transitioned from the Old Access Road to the Coquitlam Lake View Trail, at about 700M of elevation, there was snow on the trail.  By about 725M, I had to put micro spikes on my Goretex trail runners in order to maintain enough traction to tackle the steep climb in the snow.  I also used trekking poles and they saved my butt a few times when I lost balance and over the creek crossings.

The top crust is icy snow, with a soft underlayer.  It isn't too deep but you want to stick to the path where others have already compressed the snow because the moment you step on virgin snow, you are likely to step-through.  I didn't wear gaiters but if I had them with me, I would have put them on for these situations. 

The viewpoint is at 925M of elevation so you have 200M in the snow to climb over 1.6KM.

"Completely stopping smoke from entering a house is hard with your hvac and dryer going because they create a vacuum. At least it‚Äôs easy to keep your windows closed at this time of year. 

I believe in Coquitlam outdoor wood burning is prohibited so if someone is having a campfire it is illegal; however, in door wood burning (fire places / stoves) are still allowed. If you can find the source and it‚Äôs in door burning you can politely request they stop. It‚Äôs very rare that anyone needs to burn wood for heat in the lower main land. Most people just do it for ambiance. MetroVan governs air quality but a fireplace doesn‚Äôt produce anything near what is considered to be a pollutant. 
If you find someone back yard burning you have other options as it‚Äôs illegal.

"thank you don'tread2muchintoit for trusting engineers on this one!To respond to Wowabetic71, engineering constraints dictate why things are the way they are. Here's my 2 cents from an engineering perspective.

1. it's an operations yard, which means you have big vehicles moving around, You usually need a wide enough space for turning around and operating vehicles.
2. Power lines are on the east side. Storing things and driving under is probably ok, but you can't build a building right underneath a power line because of certain SRW agreements between BC Hydro and the City. Not to mention the grading issues (and significant cost) even if we are allowed to build underneath.
3. increasing density for parking will add a lot to the cost. If you look at the plan, they aren't really adding a ton of parking spots. So i suppose building taller would not save you much more surface area once you add in ramps for the amount of parking spots that's required.",t2_13ceiy,edwardolardo,0,1642118041.0,0,t1_hsk3yq4,hsk3yq4,False,AtotheZed,t3_s33ctw,https://www.reddit.com/r/coquitlam/comments/s33ctw/residents_call_for_public_hearing_over/,"Residents call for public hearing over tree-cutting near Coquitlam, B.C., park | CBC News",/r/coquitlam/comments/s33ctw/residents_call_for_public_hearing_over/hsk3yq4/,8,r/coquitlam,0,8

"I had a similar experience where a local plumbing company quoted me $1600 for 4 hours worth of work and less than $100 in parts. 

I am very handy, with tools, knowhow and experience to do the work myself. I just didn't want to ,, too busy and didnt need the stress.
So I went with the company that had the best reviews hoping to get the best service and value. Guess what? The high rating  did not result in quality work. I caught them making a shortcut, that left my plumbing extremely vulnerable to failure. Of course they knew,, they just didn't expect me to discover it. Get in and out as fast as possible and on to the next one was the likely reason behind this poor worksmanship. 

Of course when the work was complete there was  pressure via repeated emails to write a review. These are interesting times. 

High flat rate quotes are a means to ensure maximum profit to the contractor. 

Dont get me wrong,, I understand they need to earn a decent wage. There are truck cost, fuel, tools, bookeeping, web services fees, accounting, advertising, years of training and experience and a ton of other small costs that add up. They have to pay all these expenses and make a decent living on top. Plus there may be days when income is low.

But dang $400 / hr? 

Toilet re and re = an hour plus $100 in parts then an hr to dump it.
The washer/drier. 30 min. - super simple unless they are stacked and you need 2 men.
Tub faucets. An hours work max.

As a tradesman, flat rate pricing is great. You can pull in $3000/day.

As a homeowner I felt ripped off but you have to look at your options.

"I also moved to BC from SW Ontario. I lived in Victoria for 10 years, then moved to Coquitlam in July. I commute to Surrey for work. I also lived in the Fraser Valley as a kid.

I also took a job making more money than I have before. But I'll tell you, that 15% is going to disappear very quickly.

The housing market is insane in Victoria, and in Nanaimo. It's significantly worse here. Dozens of people are seeing each apartment and the prices are absolutely astronomical. Currently paying $2450 for a 2 bedroom because we required 2 parking spaces and didn't want to live in 500 square feet. I'd be living in a shitty basement suite very far out of town if anything happened to me and my partner, and I make good money. My car insurance tripled. Gas is expensive and I've never used so much of it. Parking is expensive. Transit is expensive. 

I was surprised by how short my commute was, only 20 minutes. I figured the traffic would be worse. However, since I'm travelling to Surrey, it's because I'm travelling away from the downtown core on Highway 1 to work, and toward it afterwards. If you ever have to go the other direction, you're fucked. If there's an accident, you're fucked.

The major issue is that you have to drive anywhere that you want to go, so you expose yourself to traffic more often. It's very difficult to find housing anywhere that you can easily walk or bike out your front door and be somewhere scenic and lightly populated. You have to go out of your way to do any activities where you aren't smushed in with thousands of others. You can find some excellent mountain biking in Squamish and North Van. Have fun driving there.

The most depressing part for me is simply how many people there are. Everywhere you look, towers of people shoved into tiny little boxes of apartments, every park you go to, swarms of people competing for space. Huge, multi-story parking lots to go to the grocery store. When you get this many people together, you're more likely to run into bad eggs, which means that you're more likely to experience dangerous driving on your morning commute, more likely to get shoved by some rando who wants eggs on the shelf in front of you because you took too long looking at them. There are too many people to care about all the other people. I went to Golden Ears in the summer, and I actually had to reserve a space in advance to be able to go swim there. Shoved next to a bunch of other people on an absolutely enormous beach, people as far as the eye could see. At a park that's the size of Seoul, Korea.

I think it's not as obvious to those who haven't recently lived outside of the Lower Mainland. Once you get used to living in Nanaimo, and if you enjoy the outdoors and dislike congestion, I think you'd be much happier staying where you are. Don't give up hope on your mobile home dream. I think Courtney/Comox, Campbell River, etc. will become significantly busier as people get priced out of other areas. 

I'm here because it's what's best for my family at the moment, but I'll be leaving as soon as possible. I am simply not cut out for dense city life.",t2_br54z,elmuchocapitano,0,1640888357.0,0,t1_hqkq9af,hqkq9af,True,Spthomas,t3_rrojyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/coquitlam/comments/rrojyo/life_for_young_professional_engineer/,Life for young professional engineer,/r/coquitlam/comments/rrojyo/life_for_young_professional_engineer/hqkq9af/,2,r/coquitlam,0,2

"The congestion putting around poco isn't that bad. Burke as a community to live is iffy, the transit sucks, parking sucks, and the walkability is basically zero.

"My family has lived in Nanaimo and Coquitlam for engineering work and Nanaimo would satisfy all your requirements quicker and in a more cost effective time way.  Even with current housing costs, the cost of living is reduced significantly compared to the Tricities. So are other things liking commuting.  Getting from Burke Mountain to West Coquitlam can take an easy 30 minutes with average traffic. There is no such thing as a quick run to get gas or grocery because Lougheed is brutal and with increasing density in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows spilling into Coquitlam and Poco its a nightmare all the time. Plus Burquitlam is densifying quickly in next 3 years.  I predict we will quickly be on pace with Rochmond level traffic.  In comparison, less than 30 minutes will take you right across entire Nanaimo city outskirts north to south.  You can easily find accommodations in places like Cedar or Errington that are permanent mobiles on acreage etc. Heck you could even afford a lovely little detached home.

"Hey everyone! I‚Äôve Lived in my 30+ story condo building for about 4 years now. It was built 5 years ago and there‚Äôs been some issues with the strata and I don‚Äôt trust them.     

A few residents and I have been noticing deterioration of the building that‚Äôs happening faster than we thought it would happen. Multiple cracks in the foundations and supporting beams of the building. Walls becoming misaligned, ceiling finishes coming off because of the structures movement. I‚Äôve been told that‚Äôs I‚Äôm just worrying and to ignore all the little things.  

But I just can‚Äôt seem to shake the feeling that the building was rushed during construction and now the residents are paying the price. Also with everything that‚Äôs gone down in Miami - I worry.  

As I said I don‚Äôt trust the strata to do anything about it. What are my options? The city? Hire my own structural engineer to execute an inspection?

If you NEED to drive in snow and ice... snow tires are mandatory and an AWD vehicle is also pretty much mandatory.
