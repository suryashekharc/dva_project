Former HS english teacher here and then in Manhattan. I would suggest you stay in the city to be honest. Extreme corruption in Yonkers public schools due to all the nepotism. Cover your ass doesn't even begin to explain the working conditions here. The extra 6 grand isnt worth the headaches here. Too many people have kids here for the free housing and don't raise their kids at all except for handing them a tablet. If you can get a position here don't use any of the software the school controls. Use your own systems and give them viewing rights.  A small camera in the room will help you loads too. Don't be afraid to call the cops here because the administration will never side with you.,t2_3fejm,spyro86,0,1648089045.0,0,t1_i1vrsjo,i1vrsjo,True,Popular_Kangaroo5412,t3_tlsdil,https://www.reddit.com/r/yonkers/comments/tlsdil/anyone_taught_in_yonkers_public_schools/,Anyone taught in Yonkers Public Schools?,/r/yonkers/comments/tlsdil/anyone_taught_in_yonkers_public_schools/i1vrsjo/,4,r/yonkers,0,4

You might want to get a instant water heater put in for your showers. I'm guessing your house is at least 70 years old so the insulation probably isn't up to code. the windows and baseboards have cracks along them that allow cold air in while your heat can leak out. In the summer the heat will get in and your AC will leak out. Guessing the roof probably needs to be redone as well. Check if your boiler heating coil still works or if your boiler is over 30 years old.

Most are drug addicts and if they get caught get sent to rehab on tax payer dollars and then get put on “light duty” and still get paid normal salary. I hate my city more and more everyday because it’s full of nepotism and under table deals. This is coming from someone born and raised in Yonkers. I spent my entire 20’s trying to join civil service til I realized my skin is too dark and I don’t have any connections so I’m assed out,t2_9blu5n7u,Emergency_Force4741,0,1639027320.0,0,t1_hnth45e,hnth45e,True,spyro86,t3_n96sgc,https://www.reddit.com/r/yonkers/comments/n96sgc/cops_high_on_meth_after_exposure_during_raid/,Cops high on meth after exposure during raid,/r/yonkers/comments/n96sgc/cops_high_on_meth_after_exposure_during_raid/hnth45e/,2,r/yonkers,0,2

"Hi there. I see you also posted on r/Westchester but I will answer here. I have an Ancestry/Newspaper.com account and did 30 minutes or so of looking around, and tbh I am not at all sure that this is where the couple is buried. I have found the obituary for Emilio, and while his funeral mass was at the Asbury Crestwood Church, there is no info about his burial; additionally, none of Emilio's siblings are buried together, and the couple's daughter, Rachele, is buried at Arlington with her spouse, so I cannot locate a family plot. I cannot find an obituary for Angelina, but she died much earlier, as you know; her maiden name was Marra. I know this is not your question, but I wanted to pass on some other stuff I found in case you had not. Emilio was born in 1893, and came from Cosenza Italy (province of Calabria) in 1900 at the age of 7; he lived with his parents in Eastchester/Bronxville/Tuckahoe/Yonkers (various addresses through the years). As a teen, he kept the books for his dad's butcher business. In 1919, he marries Angelina, who was born in Boston and moved to Hartford CT as a young child and ultimately to Eastchester as a teen. They married in June of 1919 and had Rachele in March 1920, they were likely pregnant just before the wedding. By 1925, the family was living together in Eastchester and Emilio reported his occupation as a ""traffic manager;"" by 1930's census, he listed himself as a salesman for a coal company. By 1940, he is still in sales (building supplies), but now he and Angelina and Rachele have moved in with Angelina's mom, Erminia and her brother, Armando in Yonkers. At some point, he became a mason, and traveled back and forth to Paris a few times in the 1960's. He died in 1973 in Georgia, likely while visiting his daughter, who lived there at the time, and likely of heart disease/failure as that is where the family asked for donations to go to. At the time of his death, he was living in Bronxville and in Florida for part of the year (obituary was  posted in Tampa Tribune as well as Yonkers papers.)

"Thanks for your reply

Our current budget for purchasing a home is between 350,000-400,000. It is only me and the misses and we have a modest income working remotely in Ohio at the moment. Around 70,000 combined after taxes+ some freelance work we both do. Our hope is to move and increase our income threshold once in New York as there is not much left for us in this state, so being able to commute to NYC is important to us while also finding an affordable and safe neighborhood to live in. We do have cars, but access to the trains is preferred if possible.

Currently, we have a little over $40,000 saved up for moving plus house hunting, but we do not intend to move until Spring/summer of next year, so that number will continue to increase thanks to our low cost of living currently. We also intend to try to make use of some of NY's first-homebuyer programs. We do not mind something small to start and would much rather purchase a home than rent if at all possible.

"It really depends what you're looking for. There are some areas that are nicer than others but the offer different things.

The nicer parts of Yonkers I'd recommend Park Hill, or Northwest Yonkers, and Dunwoodie.

Park Hill is a very beautiful neighborhood that has plenty to offer, lots of tennis, sports, clubs to join, great property, etc.

Northwest Yonkers is a suburban and business neighborhood, there is nice property, plenty of parks, and then many delis, pizzerias, and others located close to many of the residential areas.

Dunwoodie, although I don't have a lot of experience with being down there is a nice area of Yonkers with good property and a ton of businesses to explore, and the Empire City Casino. It also offers a great golf course.

I would avoid anywhere in downtown Yonkers, like Getty Square or Elm Street. There is a saying in Yonkers.. Don't live on a street named after a tree. That tends to be where the crime is the most dangerous.

But at the end of the day it really ends up to be what you're looking for.

"As a heads up this sub doesn't get much traffic, so you may try /r/Westchester too. I recently looked at homes in the area and can try to help.

Some more info would help:

- Budget

- How many people in your family/ Kids?

- Commuting? Do you have cars, need to be near one of the train stations into NYC?

Not sure where you are moving from, but Yonkers is large and the different neighborhoods can be pretty wildly different. Demographics, crime, property values, etc. South Yonkers feels like an extension of the Bronx, North Yonkers feels more Suburban generally for what that is worth.
If you're not from the area, Yonkers does have a like 0.5%-1% additional local income tax on top of Federal & State. However, property taxes are slightly less insane then the rest of Westchester towns that it usually still work out in Yonkers favor.

"Yonkers is basically the epitome of corruption. The spano crime family which is part of the greater Italian mob killed off our polish mayor in the 80s because he refused to give the Italians the city sanitation contract. There used to be seven Italian families that had different garages that were used to launder money, and they co-owned seven Brothers taxi at one point. From there it's been one Italian after another as mayor. Spano is currently on his third term going into the 4th as he and the pretty much all Italian city council changed the law so that he could run indefinitely. Pretty much everyone in every department is related to him or is indebted to him in one way or another. It's sort of like playing a degrees of separation game in Yonkers. Quezada is no different. He was supposed to be set up to be the new mayor but because people in the city actually know his dirty secrets that isn't happening anytime soon.

So I try not to take information off social media sites at face value. I tried looking up some of what you shared. The water pipes stuff came up. But I'm a bit dismayed by how little news coverage seems to come out of Yonkers, in general. I guess that's the state of the local media landscape throughout the country. Decimated. Further, I get that a good portion of what you shared isn't likely to come out, as I'm aware of a few relatively minor DOE scandals that may never surface.  


That said, I'm wondering how the Yonkers leadership is decided. Was he appointed by the mayor? Elected? Has it always been this corrupt?

Our school system is led by quesada, a person who as a principal caused over 20 lawsuits that ranged from sleeping with female students, assaulting parents, assaulting students, assaulting staff, being caught removing non-potable water signs, and so much more. Most of our schools should not be open due to them not having potable water but he has made the test results private whereas before him they were public and pipes were being replaced a little by little. Almost every principle is now related to him. He stole about 2 million dollars from the budget and then had the hearing postponed for 3 years until he could pay it back because he bought four supermarkets.

"I think what the poster was referring to was the central office board of education leadership , like assistant superintendents and other department leads since they control the decision making of the schools. 

I somewhat see where they are coming from and I am a person of Hispanic origin. The district leadership did promote the Dominican heritage event heavily , no where near the level of any other event with the text blasts, and teachers telling students in class; not even the event with our Congressman received that level of promotion and I would say he was a way more prominent figure than those who participated for the Dominican heritage event. 

My question and one I would like to figure it out is that if Hispanic educators lower the bar in terms of academic excellence because Hispanic kids are not expected to reach the same heights as white/Asian kids. Whereas, white educators are more demanding because the norms are higher so they expect more. It would be interesting to see if K-8 schools with White/Asian principals have a more rigorous curriculum, more academic opportunities because this is what you need to be successful. whereas in the Hispanic community just making it to high school and graduating is like gold and that is why regardless of effort kids pass to the next grade just so the district can say we have a 90% high school graduation rate. But in reality how successful did they set up our kids ? Are they watering down the curriculum to boost high school graduation rates? I know my kids are not receiving the full curriculum that the state requires the district to give them, so they are not compliant in providing a sound base education, but because I am Hispanic single mother I am told “well you know your kids should be happy they reached this far in their education, there’s many Hispanics who wished they accomplish a fraction of what your kids did”.

"Would you mind elaborating on the racist part? I have very limited experience as I just moved here, but I got those vibes. There was an event around black history month, and a text message was sent out to everyone promoting a Dominican related event within that week. No other event, before or after this, has ever been distributed via text as far as I have been here.

There was also a few posts on the Yonkers facebook page. One lady called out the schools due to issues with distributing laptops during the school, and was told by her employer that someone in Yonkers schools called them to tell them that they should quit the rhetoric (if I remember correctly, she did work for NY state in Albany)

The second was a lady who posted a facebook message about how she wrote a message to the superintendent about inequality in her childs education. That week, she had CPS randomly show up at her door for a child welfare visit. Someone called them and they couldn't divulge who, but it was weird timing that it happened right after.

Now most of the board of education is made up of his friends and family. Millions of dollars went missing from the budget around the same time that he somehow gathered enough money to buy three supermarkets. The investigation was stoned walled for close to 2 years during which time the money showed up again. He has friends and family in no show positions. He lifted the ban on drinking from the fountains despite the water being non potable. The lead levels are illegally high. By law the schools are supposed to be shut down and have their pipes gutted and replaced.

"Having lived here for 9 years (albeit in an apartment building, not a house), my sense is that the city government generally has good intentions and is trying to do it right, but their enthusiasm to communicate sometimes overmatches their competency in doing so. (The number of voicemails from Mayor Mike left on my phone are Exhibit A of this, but what they lack in slickness they make up for in earnestness and/or enthusiasm.)

""Commingles"" just means anything that isn't pure paper/cardboard goes out together, i.e., glass, metal and plastic.

In your particular case, I imagine why they don't publish a PDF of your collection dates/times is because I think it can vary from block to block and probably even which side of the street some places -- although you'd think that information would be able to be a look-up somewhere. and probably is. But four things that might help:

* Call Mayor Mike's help line at 914-377-HELP (4357) and ask them when your pickup dates are or, better, where on the [yonkers.gov](https://yonkers.gov) site you can find 'em, and what happens when it snows. (Bonus: If you get an answer or a link, update your post, because I'm sure lots of other people have this question.)
* Download the ""[Recycle Coach](https://recyclecoach.com/residents/find-my-municipality/)"" app for either iOS or Android. It apparently can give you your own address's pickup dates. (I haven't installed it so can't confirm that, but it says it can.)
* Just for further definitions/recycling guidance, this other PDF may be helpful: [https://www.yonkersny.gov/home/showpublisheddocument?id=12537](https://www.yonkersny.gov/home/showpublisheddocument?id=12537)
* Did you ask one of your new neighbors? Might be a good opportunity to meet them!

"Guessing you're renting your router. Go and get a newer one from them in person. As it's a rental go in every 6 months or so and get a new one. 

If you bought it time to upgrade. 

if in an apt tell them verizon was around and was messing with the lines. Complain since they've been around the quality of net and tv gets worse. Have them run a speed test on site with the little signal analyzer on the end of the coax and every place the line gets split. Could be crappy signal, could be a rotting coaxial cable, could be a bad splitter. 

Have them run a direct line as it's probably being shared with neighbors. Takes more time but you get better speed and tv. No more booster. It boosts the bad and good.

 If it's private housing then they charge you to do the above. Usually from 90 to 200.

 If there is anyone else in your house I suggest swapping. Tell them you're moving out and someone else will be moving in soon.

That means changing any accounts that use it to a Gmail, msn, or any other email account. Cancel your account. Wait a day call up as the other tenant. Get a new account under the other persons name. You might need to wait up to a week to get the new install. Get them to fix and install everything the right way to make a new customer a long time customer.

That being said loyalty means nothing to big companies. If all you have is net and not the triple play then you might try verizon but they charge more on rentals and install then optimum.",t2_3fejm,spyro86,0,1611925678.0,0,t1_gl8b40z,gl8b40z,True,DoubleMMike,t3_l3nadq,https://www.reddit.com/r/yonkers/comments/l3nadq/anyone_have_any_experience_negotiating_with/,Anyone have any experience negotiating with Optimum?,/r/yonkers/comments/l3nadq/anyone_have_any_experience_negotiating_with/gl8b40z/,2,r/yonkers,0,2

"The excellent website *Cinema Treasures* has an entry on the RKO Procter Theater here:

[http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7268](http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7268)

They also have three photos, two of the exterior in black and white (one from 1931, the other undated), and a color photo of the interior after the theater closed (undated, but must be 1976 or later).

The entry has a good deal of information on the history of the Proctor. I love this website.

EDITED TO ADD: Another excellent website, *After the Final Curtain,* which is dedicated to abandoned theaters, also has an entry on the Proctor. Plenty of photos of the very decayed interior, shot in 2012.

"Call city hall. They'll tell you what you need to know. This city does everything in person and they prefer cash so they can cook the books and say you never paid. Keep your receipts. Digitize them it can be months before they serve you with a failure to pay notice.

Guessing it's a newer building or one of the ones bought out recently. Not much you can do about the lease. Might be better off just selling a lot of it if you think they won't be coming back within 6 months. There are a few storage places around nepperhan that have storage spaces where you could drive vehicles inside and put the furniture around it but you're looking at 300 a month times however many months. You could always drive upstate like 2 hours where the storage lockers are cheaper though. Have anyone you can trust to rent it in their place?

I want access to upstate NY without having to pass through the numerous bridges / traffic junctions.  I wanted access to bike trails, etc.

This link will automatically write the letter for you and find your congressperson near your home address. This universal basic income bill will provide every American adult with $1000 per month and additional $500 per child under the age of 18.

"Late answer, but... Yonkers station or Bronxville are accessible from Park Hill, and on the two different lines (Hudson and Harlem) so different schedules. Parking is tough at either, because there's a waitlist for the daily garage at Yonkers, and only street parking for Bronxville, and most of that is metered.

"That area isn’t exactly what I would call “safe” although it is a bit quieter than the main station in Yonkers. There’s nothing over there besides some bodegas and you’ll need to walk up a very steep hill to get to them. 
If you go up the very steep hill (I definitely suggest having a car here) they built up a little area by Executive Blvd with some restaurants and a Starbucks and they add stuff new now and again (I haven’t been here in a year but it looked like a nice area they were putting together).

"I agree. Finding a a place to settle whether it’s buying or renting is kind of hard especially when you want to commute to the city.

If we live in Ludlow, we will probably never visit the local restaurants/retail. We tend to drive into the city or further out into Westchester.

"Well its a simple fix which won't be carried out. The current superintendent of schools has about 30 million in law suits against him from years of crap he did as a principal. It's still all under investigation. Fire him and make his lawsuits personal instead of vs the school system. Fire all the other principals who currently have lawsuits against them. 


Moving forward remove principals from schools. Hire 2 out of 3 for each principal or assistant principal removed; security guard, office staff, counselor.


The online aspects of the schools get redone every year, new systems, site redesigns, etc. It's a waste of cash. Stick with something until it has to be replaced. Stop buying apple products for schools, android products are cheaper and wont get stolen as often.


 Expel kids. There are many who should be expelled, do it. Let schools be for those that want to be there, let cps and the police deal with the others.


Stop cooking lunches that get tossed out because a kid wants the nuggets but not the over boiled veggies, bad crumbly fruit, and 1% milk that comes with it. End the Frito lay contract and let the cooks cook actual food. Less quality food is better than the bonk.
