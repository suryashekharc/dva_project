The amount of money you get is so low that you eventually find a groove enter you can just barely get by, worth 0 wiggle room - this locks people into a pattern which becomes a cycle. 

Giving people more money would likely, with support from social workers, give people enough room to breath so they can see past the next financial emergency which might give them the ability to see a future that is different. 

To anyone worried about “freeloaders” or people “abusing the system”: it’s going to happen. No question. But try to beat in mind that most people living on Assistance aren’t nefarious scamming the people of the province -they’re mostly just people who need help.

"A perk of living uptown should be the ability to forgo car ownership, but SJ tends to miss the mark. By avoiding owning a car you save money, time for maintenance, parking, fines... etc. Any infrastructure that supports this should be prioritised: 

* Proper small grocery stores with all the basics, distributed evenly around uptown. I currently live in a European city where your typical neighbourhood grocery store is around 5k-10k ft^(2). I do most of my shopping at one that is around 5k ft^(2). Comparatively, SuperStore is needlessly oversized (Rothesay Ave is around 110k ft^(2)?) which forces car ownership.
* Other essential stores, e.g. pharmacies. 
* Good public transit and bicycling infrastructure.
* When it's not possible to get around by public transit, it should be easy to rent a car, even for short trips. A rental car agency should be easy to get to. In my city I can rent cars by the hour through an app - both cars dedicated for this purpose, and from neighbours who rent out their cars in the app.

You get used to it, you drive over it all the time sometimes and don’t think much of it. Sometimes though you look at it and acknowledge it’s coolness and scenic-ness.

Sone fun perspectives of it are that a lot of people I knew growing up as well as soooo many tourists thought it was a waterfall that went up instead of down or something like that. Everyone is disappointed to learn the truth.

"For a foodie I recommend Port City Royal. The food is pretty creative and has some fusion to it, they also seem to try to do as much as possible in terms of making all their own stuff like pickles. Also Tom is the best bartender in the city and that bar is the best stocked I’ve seen. Also also, it has a good “hipster” atmosphere which isn’t common in Saint John 

Decimal 81 is a favourite amongst my family, I don’t know if they still do this but it used to be on certain days you could get a 5 course meal for like 45 dollars and it was good quality too. In recent years I think I’ve found them less inspiring with them seemingly not changing their menu as much as they used to and introducing more casual options like burgers but it’s still a great place.

East Coast Bistro I’ve only been to once but it was very good and I remember it being mostly modern European food though I could be wrong.

Italian by Night is very good and one of the only choices for truly authentic Italian food in SJ, or at least as authentic as it gets there. It’s always a fun experience especially since they do stuff like bring you wet clothes to wash your hands, make me feel fancy y’know.

Thandis is decent Indian food i think.

We live in the north end off of Douglas Ave and love it.  We do not drive.  We can walk to Uptown in 20 minutes and do so 4-5 times a week.  Buses are not reliable here but we have 7 buses that leave from and stop at Lansdowne and Main which is a 7 minute walk to our home (there is 1 bus that comes within 30 seconds) .  Uptown rocks too and as we do not own a car no prob for us.  We can easily get baked goods, groceries, go for a coffee/drink, etc.  Life is pretty easy.

I would be careful about being dependent on transit to get to and from work.  Bus hours can be weird and can change unilaterally.

"I lived in the south end waterfront area when I was working in Saint John (I’m now working in Fredericton) and really enjoyed it, even if it is a little run-down (it is perfectly safe, though).

Uptown has lots of great pubs, coffee shops and restaurants, along with City Market.  There’s a Giant Tiger within walking distance as well for groceries, etc.  Unfortunately, Brunswick and Market Squares are basically vacant, apart from a few restaurants along the harbour front.

There is a paved walkway along the waterfront, stretching from the south end to Reversing Falls and makes for a great walk in the summer/fall.

Public transit is ok at best - I found it fine for going to McAllister Mall/East Point (note that it ends at 5ish on Sundays) but I wouldn’t want to have to transfer.  There aren’t any express buses either, so it takes about 30 minutes to get there.",t2_cte0mvuq,Dragonpaddler,0,1648720544.0,0,t1_i2tuj2h,i2tuj2h,True,NearbySpirit,t3_tsjwjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tsjwjb/moving_to_saint_john/,Moving to Saint John,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tsjwjb/moving_to_saint_john/i2tuj2h/,2,r/SaintJohnNB,0,2
"Public transportation is unreliable at best, and the city/province has been working very hard to gut the whole system for years now. You can afford a cab every day, right?

This is [my personal preffered living areas map](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NyzTXf3QZFpr8kWsRsvKN8YrNyMsPP0O/view?usp=sharing). I work on the east side and own a car, and find most of the city easy to live in, which is why I have most of the east side in green. I would mark a good portion of West in green if I worked on that side of the bridges. It can be difficult to get across those whenever they're under construction, which is often.

The red is just too far for me to commute from with my current needs, and the burnt orange spots in town are parts of town I consider bad, at least as a car owner. I would personally avoid the West Side Docks area like a plague, unless you work at the docs - it's fairly slummy in most of that area, though it quickly transitions to family housing around Martello Tower, and you might like to be close to the Irving Nature Park, which is admitedly a fabolous way to quickly distance yourself from the hustle and bustle of the city. The area across the water from there is not generally bad if you don't own a car, just avoid Waterloo (To be fair, there's a great laundromat and corner store there, I just wouldn't live there).

The smaller purple circle is where you'll smell the pulp mill practically all the time, the larger one is where you can expect to smell the oil refinery most of the time. Of the two I can put up with the smell of the oil refinery the least. There are lighter purple circles surrounding those where the smell carries on hot smoggy summer days.

If you work over east, aren't trying to support other people, and have your own transportation, I would expand those living areas as far as Rothesay. The drive is fairly short into town, though I have never really been, and so have no opinions about living conditions there. As far as Grand-Bay if you work West, and are okay with a 15 to 20 minute drive. Highway driving can be scary during the winter, don't skimp on winter tires, That turnoff at Saints Rest Marsh can get particularly icy, and we call that big hill between there and Grand Bay 4 seasons hill for a reason.

You'd do best to work through an agency here, get the terms of your lease drawn up and agreed to in advance. There are plenty of buildings owned by slumlords that you'd want to avoid, so I would generally avoid buildings that aren't listed under a company name, and politely decline interest if they try to tell you you'll be presented with your lease after you move in/make the first payment.

And finally, shop around early, give yourself at least a few months to come to a decision. People will try to fastball you into an unfavourable agreement.",t2_c5rek,Rhumald,0,1648695131.0,0,t1_i2sufxh,i2sufxh,True,NearbySpirit,t3_tsjwjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tsjwjb/moving_to_saint_john/,Moving to Saint John,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tsjwjb/moving_to_saint_john/i2sufxh/,5,r/SaintJohnNB,0,5
"If you like cafes, pubs, and outdoors, you will want to live somewhere between uptown and the East portion of the North End (near Rockwood Park). I grew up there and it is amazing for that lifestyle. You can walk to work uptown and walk to grocery stores on Lansdowne Ave. You can bike to Irving Nature Park, Rockwood, and Tucker Park.

Public transportation is very poor due to years of cuts, a terrible investment in a massive new office building, and the provincial government repeatedly refusing federal funding. City council has some ideas to optimize what we have now, but efficiency can only go so far without actual funding. Unfortunately the next few years are looking rough for SJ because the provincial government keeps screwing our budget. If Irving goes ahead with their new water treatment plant we're going to see a massive blow to city revenue too.

You can make do in the North end or uptown because most things are nearby, but overall SJ is a commuter city. A car massively improves your quality of life here. Most professionals currently live outside city limits in Rothesay or Quispamsis and commute into town for work and entertainment.",t2_5zpvr,Vok250,0,1648678984.0,0,t1_i2rv5ho,i2rv5ho,True,NearbySpirit,t3_tsjwjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tsjwjb/moving_to_saint_john/,Moving to Saint John,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tsjwjb/moving_to_saint_john/i2rv5ho/,7,r/SaintJohnNB,0,7
"Hey, start with cafes/pubs. Uptown has a lot of nice patios in summer for pubs. Lily's cafe at rockwood park is real nice as well. If you're looking for access to things walking distance uptown is a good place to start out for living (because it's close to most night life and activities). But you don't want to stay uptown long term in my opinion. No parking which is a major pain during winter months with snow bans. Millidgeville is a nice spot to stay as it's a bit outside the fog belt and is residential and quiet. Public transport is ok I suppose, but the thing with Saint john is it is a sprawling city so it takes a long time to get anywhere on the bus. Some people may disagree on some that I've said but hopefully it helps you out with at least a bit of a starting point. Good luck with the move!

"Honestly, I just say in the Foodie group to make fun of them. A lot of the members tend to be big on ""value for the money"" which is why you constantly see a barrage of chain restaurants or restaurants where 90% of your meal is fries (looking at you, Pub Down Under). That said, I think they actually do have to deny multiple reviews for fast food chains on the daily, so. 

If there is an upper scale food group for SJ, I would 100% join.

That said, some of my absolute favourite restaurants in the city: 

* Asia's Best on Coburg - Not the best ambian ce, but their bibimbap is the best. It comes out piping hot in a stone bowl. The owner will stand beside you and mix it up if she doesn't think you are doing it well enough, haha! I appreciate it.
* Vegolution - I have never been disappointed there. The Santa Fe salad? Amazing. Their burgers are phenomenal. I'd rather their burger over any meat burger, any day.
* The Robertson - This is in Rothesay, but if you want upscale with a fresh menu that constantly changes, go here. Their desserts are divine.

"It's Facebook, so of course the user base is stratified towards ppl who like facebook's brand of easy to access content. Just lurk in any other SJ centric FB group and you'll see who's there, and can decide if you want to trust their judgement on anything. 

There aren't enough places in town to support a BlogTO style restaurant reviewing approach, it really only takes a few minutes of googling to find the names of everything, and get reviews via tripadvisor, yelp, etc, for what that's worth.

Off the top of my head, if you're a foodie you should go to (not sure if they're all open):

Italian by night

East coast

Thandi

Port city royal

Decimal 81?

Suwanna/Splash/Lemongrass

Billys

Thats just a 5 second look, there's a number of others in that higher end space. Also a number of gastropubs that are all worth a trip. I've actually found that a good source of info about restaurants in town is the staff of the places you're already eating at!

Why not start putting up ""ZIPPER MERGE AHEAD"" signs instead?

Also, westbound onto harbour bridge has 2 onramps merging into one lane so the right lane will always be stopped while passing lane would only have the zipper merge point - thus why anyone actually in the passing lane is considered a cheater and often it's blocked by cars or trucks not wanting to be passed.

"SJ is not bike friendly...for many reasons: 1) no real dedicated lanes on the flatter roads, 2) cars will nearly hit you (if not hit you) and won't care most of the time, 3) not many spots to lock your bike up (trust me - you will want to do that!), 4) it's really not safe this early into Spring (roads have too much gravel, snow build up in spots, and lots of little things which will make you wipe out or get a flat), 5) there are laws, not enforced as SJ Police are understaffed & won't stop a speeding car.

depending where you are and where you need to go, walking is almost the safest method for the next 2mon.  You can jump on the bus (if you figure out that f'd up schedule) when needed.   Weather is still cold for daily bikes (possible snow coming still).

Harbour passage is one of the better safer routes (there is a speed limit and courtesy to walkers).  Sadly, sidewalks are safer than on the side of the road.

"Riverfront? yeah sure, it's underutilized, but nowhere near as close to underutilized/ undervalued as the oceanfront.   We don't have a ferry anymore, we have no legal way to get to Partridge Island, our oceanfront beaches get almost no investment, and on both the West Side and East, the harbourfront is dominated by industry/ almost completely off limits for the public.  Other than going for a walk on the beach, or hiking the nature park, there's almost no places to have a beer while sitting back watching the waves roll in, other than just bringing a beer to the beach yourself.    


I'm not sure there's a single restaurant or bar with an ocean view that is not Uptown, and Uptown's ocean views are nothing compared to what can be found on the West Side or up Redhead way.    


I'll never understand why people are so obsessed with the river valley here in the Saint John area... it IS very scenic, but so is the Bay of Fundy. Saint John must be one of the only coastal metro areas in Canada where people pay more to be FURTHER from the ocean.  Imo,  (the ocean) is the single greatest thing going for this city, our coastal areas are even more underdeveloped than our riverfront areas.  Dominion Park is getting a huge investment, and that's great, Dominion Park is great, but so is Seaside Park, so are Bayshore/McLarens/Saint's Rest Beaches... and Tin Can beach too! I feel our ocean beaches need far more investment and caretaking than they currently get.  I know back in the day there was some sort of beachfront bar/ dance hall on the West Side... but right now, there's not even a single store or even an ice cream stand anywhere near our ocean front beaches.

"Saint John seriously underutilizes the riverfront. Even at Tucker Park they spent money installing a brand new accessibility deck, but they never actually open the second gates so it's completely pointless. The boat launch at RKYC is in complete disrepair and has no parking infrastructure. Even the private wooden launch inside RKYC is a complete pain in the ass to launch tiny 90lb Lasers. Seems like everything on the river is either private property or completely rundown.

Then you go out to Meenan's Cove and it's night and day. Makes you wonder why Saint John hasn't done similar.

I ordered a Panang curry (which I have had many times from the one in town) and when I got home, it was dry as hell.

The best part is the curry gravy, and this was just a pile of dry ass orange tinted chicken.

I called to ask what’s the deal and I wanted a replacement, explaining I’ve had it many times, and that this was not made properly. I said I’d go pick it up and bring the dry nasty one back.

They said they’re too busy and would have a manager call me back. 2 hours later (ish) someone called. I explained the situation, know what they said?  Add water.

"Sorry, this is pretty masturbatory but it got me thinking: 
I grew up around the falls and spent a lot of time down by the water watching them. So many memories are tied up with that area; the bridge, the lookout, the Murray & Gregory buildings. 
The old ships on the Lancaster Ave side of the falls. 
I walked across the bridge to and from school most days. The bridge would sway in the middle when big trucks would go by -sometimes I’d run to get to the middle, sometimes I’d run to get away from it. Later i spent a lot of time under the bridge out in the middle fighting a fear of heights and doing the stupidest things. 
Friends and I would drink and and do drugs down by the water and once one of us fell in -I shudder (and smile) at the memory. 

The sound of the water was a constant. 
The occasional suicides and attempted suicides were heart-breaking. 
The pulp mill used to let off pressure and the house would shake. 
My dad died there. I lost my virginity there. Fell in love -and broke my heart a few times. I was molested within earshot of the water. I made music there. 

I could go on for days but you were asking what locals thought about it: It was normal to the point of never thinking about it. As i got older i sometimes thought ‘why are we making this something it isn’t?’ or ‘why are we calling this Reversing *Falls*. I also felt really possessive of it like it was all mine. When the Zipline place went in I felt like it was a bother because it brought more people -selfish and silly of me but that’s what i felt. 

The tourist stuff always felt crass and annoyed me but now that I’m older i get why it existed.

"You have no idea how much Conservatives and Liberals hate the CBC. I would also guess that any political party forming the government would grow to, at least, resent the CBC. 

The CBC has done a spectacular job of biting the hands that feeds it over the years. 

The idea that the CBC is a mouthpiece for the government is, and always has been, wrong. 

That’s not to say that the CBC is perfect -or the ultimate form of providing journalism; but it has consistently done its job well. 

Unfortunately governments really have found a way to destroy the CBC -cut after cut after cut has left the CBC a shell of what it once was -they had to lay off technicians (and it shows to this day). Then journalists had to try and be technicians and journalists. With further cuts journalists were let go and those remaining are doing a job that used to be done by 4 or 5 different people. All this is starting to show but still they aren’t anywhere close to being ‘State Media’. 

It’s healthy to criticize tax funded projects and the CBC is deserving of criticism -but it ain’t never been ‘State Media’",t2_6kd0xri4,value_vacuum,0,1647307896.0,0,t1_i0p0e6b,i0p0e6b,False,mmitchener,t3_te8sqd,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/te8sqd/construction_at_old_cost_guard_base_being_halted/,Construction at old Cost Guard base being halted?,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/te8sqd/construction_at_old_cost_guard_base_being_halted/i0p0e6b/,9,r/SaintJohnNB,0,9

Here is Saint John's zoning by-law: https://saintjohn.ca/sites/default/files/2021-02/Zoning%20By-Law_0.pdf

Agricultural use applies to RS, RR, and RMX zones (different flavours of rural areas). 

Find out what your property is zoned as and then you can look up what's allowed and what's restricted in your area. For example, in RR (Rural Residential), you can have up to two goats as long as you have at least 6000 square meters, and more goats with more area. And other restrictions.

"So re: the cold water, that is not universal. The Bay of Fundy is uniquely shaped, being long, narrow and very deep so cold water is always being churned back up and Nova Scotia blocks the warm Gulf Stream. The Atlantic coast of NS has fewer nice beaches, but the water is marginally warmer. The money is the Strait between PEI and the mainland, warmest water north of the Carolinas, allegedly. Actually warm enough to swim, and I'm quite fussy about that. Usually I don't get in north of Cuba, but from the bridge to the island all the way up to about St. Anne-de-Kent is relatively shallow and will warm in the summer. The warmth will sometimes cause problems to algae blooms and jellyfish, but you were coming relatively early so it usually takes to the end of the summer before Parley Beach gets really gross. It's impressive, but I'd recommend Murray Beach closer to the bridge.

"I grew up a short distance from the Pacific, but haven't been to the Atlantic ever. And definitely not to any place with such vertical tide range.

So it's cold year round. RIP. I assume that is universal for other Maritime provinces like NS and PEI. It makes more sense that the coast has variable terrain, but Google image results are certainly skewed to some popular spots and gave me the impression that they are more homogeneous. The lack of lifeguards even in popular locations is certainly indicative of how people tend not to swim/surf. 

However, what is not as variable as the terrain across the bay is probably the tide cycle, right? Or do different parts of the bay will have different time for low/high tide? I will head back to mainland as soon as slack tide ends just to be on the safe side. 

We will probably buy our seafood in the store too, but I was considering clam digging as a potential fun family activity when we are  at the beach. Just want to make sure it's not illegal if we ever decide to do so.

"So, you've never been to the Bay of Fundy and you don't live near an ocean, right? Similar answers to both questions. Technically swimming and clam digging are legal wherever, but there are serious safety and practicality concerns with both. 

First, the Fundy coast has wildly variable terrain. Lots of granite rocks and cliffs. Beautiful, but no clams and if you were crazy enough to get in the water you'd likely be bashed against the rocks. There are lots of rivers and streams breaking this up, plus more sheltered bays and coves, so you will get a mixture of mud flats, marshes, and the odd sandy or gravel beach. Obviously mud is where you'll get bivalves, and some of the beaches are safe to swim at, conditions permitting.

 Surf will depend on the tide and weather and may or may not be dangerous. Generally don't get in anything where the waves are breaking higher than your waist or crossing each other. Rip tides or currents are rare, often a warning will be posted if it's relevant. There's unlikely to be a lifeguard, even at popular locations, but other people around are a good gage of how safe it is. There are swimable beaches at the end of the peninsula the town of St. Andrews is on, plus by the campground/ferry landing/Old Sow on Deer Island and at New River Beach provincial park. There are definitely more, but those are easy to find, popular and actually pretty nice. However, all that said, the water in the bay is ridiculously cold all year round. Lots of locals go to the beach, but it's mostly playing in the sand and enjoying the scenery. Maybe jumping in the surf. The only people totally immersed are children and the foolhardy. 

If you must, I'd time it so the tide has just come up over the sand after its been baking in the sun. That sometimes warms up the water enough to make it tolerable. This ties into the point about the tides and their influence on beach activities. It's important to remember when we say 20 or 30 or even 50 foot tides up at the far end by Moncton, this is a vertical measurement, not horizontal. If this is next to a cliff it doesn't matter, but a beach can go from just a few meters of sand at high tide to hundreds when it's low. There are islands you can walk to at low tide that you very much cannot at high tide, and you will be stuck there if you don't come back in time. It moves fastest in the middle part of the cycle, sometimes 4 or 5 feet an hour, even in the relatively calm western end of the bay, so changes can happen quickly. Look out for things like seaweed on rocks (some of which can be over your head), wet rocks, the collection of debris at the typical high tide line, that kind of stuff. It really is walking on the bottom of the ocean. Always assume the next wave will go further than the one happening now. 

Clams apparently don't require a license, and you are allowed to take them up to 100 a day from April to December. The trick is to find a safe place with enough mud and no industrial contamination or red tide. If the clams aren't safe to eat there will usually be signs. The only place I know off the top of my head where the stars align for this is Little Lepreau basin off Maces Bay. I've seen decent sized groups digging there last summer. No idea if anyone does tours for that. Not sure anyone's asked before. It's hard, dirty work. We usually just buy clams at the store. Don't buy them from some guy's trunk in a parking lot. You don't know where those clams came from.",t2_7epjjjn2,Unusual_Pitch_608,0,1647090827.0,0,t1_i0d5knn,i0d5knn,False,cogitatingspheniscid,t3_tb2sn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb2sn1/whalewatching_in_june/,Whalewatching in June?,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb2sn1/whalewatching_in_june/i0d5knn/,2,r/SaintJohnNB,0,2
"I bought an ebike last year and have been using it daily to get from the north end to uptown daily (through snow, ice, hurricaines, wind, ..) and have used it all winter up until market slip got fenced off.  It's a great way to get through the city but I'll admit the lack of safe infrastructure does make it pretty scary in most places.  All the key connections between areas of the city are all provincially controlled (rte 100 & overpasses) and we all know how helpful the province has been to Saint John.

Traveling North-Central means riding Main Street for a portion.  Going Central-East means City Road, Thorne, Rothesay Ave or the causeway.  Going West-North means the reversing falls bridge and simms corner (turning left onto Douglas Ave is pretty scary), Irving Nature Park means taking Catherwood, going to Sobeys North means taking Lansdowne, central up to rockwood means a jaunt up the big crown st. bridge and so on.  

On my $1200 ebike with 3"" tires I've had no issues with weather or hills in Saint John.  It's a common  excuse given.  I biked right up Main St during a snowstorm a couple weeks back where I watched cars struggle with traction going up through the lights.

"Johnny, with respect because I love the city and I sense your love is sincere too, you have to come here if you are going to write here. The city herself is a character, and you should meet her if you are to do her justice. She is a complicated lady.

Reversing Falls would be an excellent start, with all its misnomers and contradictions, beauty and brutality. The Falls are underwhelming at first, down an obscure side street, past the abandoned store that's been for sale as long as I can remember, past the run down industrial lot and the zip line office trailer, around the overgrown parking loop infested with invasive plant species, next to the public washrooms, in the shadow of the last remaining mill on this part of the river, a towering behemoth that devoured all the others, and the fermenters the last real Canadian brewery.

If you timed it wrong, there might not be much apart from the squabbles of the gulls and the geese on the islands that create the rapids, now buried somewhere in the 20+ foot tides. But maybe you came when those islands have seemingly doubled in height, at the lowest point of the tide they really almost do seem like falls as the river emerges from the harbour. Or maybe during that brief calm of slack tide, where the water that was impassible rapids three hours ago is now still like a lake, until that stillness is shattered by the roar of a speed boat rushing to avoid the wait until the next tide to go back to the marina. But back to that first, boring moment. Having now seen low tide, you get the feeling something is off. The river is actually flowing backwards, as salt water overpowers the flow, reversing the falls. Seals bob in the water, following the fish sucked in with the water. The gulls circle and squawk, disturbed some tourists are now zip lining towards the tower they were occupying. It's the kind of place that grows on you, that repeat visits are necessary to appreciate the dynamics of the landscape. 

And yeah, then there's the friggin' bridge, and the place where the gas station blew up, the kitchy restaurant next to the park that's actually owned by the guy who owns the mill across the street so it's not a public park, but it used to the location of the provincial asylum, which is a whole other thing.

"Specifically unique? I don't think so. Honestly, I haven't personally been, but my understanding is it's just better odds of seeing rare things like whales or unusual birds, especially migratory ones, because of its remote location which is itself the most unique thing about the place. Its allegedly beautiful, but so are a lot of places in the region. It's worth it if you want to max out the odds of seeing a whale or the most possible bird species, or the least possible light pollution at night, but if you are on a schedule it's quite the time bandit, plus the possibility of weather either cancelling the ferry or making it pointless to go due to fog negating all visibility, and the very limited amenities on the island itself.

"As a local, I found the geology/science behind it cool.

But aside from that, I see it as a neat feature and don’t really think about it aside some mild paranoia about somehow falling into it when crossing the bridge. (Which I will never do on foot, only in a vehicle.)

"> Did the Irvings purposefully build everything as far from everything else as possible to make walking a nightmare so more people would get cars and get more gas?

You're not too far off the truth. It wasn't the Irvings, but it was decades of corporate lobbying in the US and Canada. The city planning trends we have today wasn't the result of public opinion, efficient operations, or even a simple accident.

Single family zoning was invented to sneakily prolong segregation after the US supreme court banned it. Jaywalking was invented by the automotive industry so that they could monopolize streets and dodge responsibility for fatal from accidents. They lobbied for legislation to make jaywalking illegal across the US and Canada and they also pumped out marketing to make it socially unacceptable. At the same time they outright purchased and shut down any private companies operating trams and other forms of mass transit. The idea of highways straight through the center of town and living miles from groceries and work was invented by GM for the 1939 world's fair.  They then lobbied the federal governments in Canada and USA to invest billions of taxpayer dollars transforming our continent into that oil-dependent nightmare.

In more modern decades GM killed of EV projects and lobbied for legislation banning alternative forms of transportation. Did you know that E-bikes/scooters/skateboards over 500W are actually illegal in NB? It's also illegal to ride a bicycle on sidewalks despite the complete lack of cycling infrastructure in this province.",t2_5zpvr,Vok250,0,1647025188.0,0,t1_i09x290,i09x290,False,AidanInFreddy,t3_tb7cqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb7cqx/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/,Ditching car due to high gas prices (media call out),/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb7cqx/ditching_car_due_to_high_gas_prices_media_call_out/i09x290/,6,r/SaintJohnNB,0,6

"Great area if you are into this sort of thing. Obviously the Fundy Islands (Deer, Campobello, Grand Manan) are tops for whales and sea birds.

On the mainland I'd recommend the Sam Orr Pond trail in the Caughey-Taylor nature preserve, just east of St. Andrews. Relatively short, easy trail if you want it to be and a unique mixing of warm fresh and salt water in a brackish marsh. Only place quahogs are found in the area, apparently. Should be lots of herons, fresh and salt water ducks and eagles. Further up the bay by the Black's Harbour ferry to Grand Manan is the Pea Point nature preserve which has a more rocky coast, but also a gravel beach with lots of sea glass.

"I've only been out in early or mid-August and it was mostly minkes and right whales. This year I'm aiming to get out later in August for a shot at some humpbacks.

Jolly Breeze in St Andrews is the one I've used most, though they're all good. All the whale watching outfits co-operate and help each other out with regards to letting the each other know where whales are spotted. I just checked and it looks like you can book something from June 11 onward, though at this point there seem to be only one or two outings per day.  

I like going out on the zodiac, but the bright orange survival gear is definitely going to be needed and it's not flattering on anyone. Be there early -- they don't screw around with lates/no shows. 

They also have a tall ship which is a bit more sedate and more appropriate if there are younger kids or people who don't want their bones rattled. It's not as exhilarating as the zodiac but you've still got a shot to see something.

The best part of any of those tours is when they cut the engines and you're just floating on open water waiting to see if a whale is going to spume. Sometimes there's porpoises and there's always seals. But between the silence, the water, the smell of the air and the chance to see some whales... it's pretty peaceful. Most of them offer snacks at some point in the tour, as well. It's usually something like hot cocoa and a ginger-molasses cookie or pea soup but it probably depends on who you go with.

Honestly, though I've been lucky and have seen whales the 4 out of 4 times I've been out there, it's such a nice way to spend 3 or 4 hours I almost wouldn't mind if we don't see any actual whales.",t2_3q3cr,Bobannon,0,1646948191.0,0,t1_i05rkjk,i05rkjk,True,cogitatingspheniscid,t3_tb2sn1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb2sn1/whalewatching_in_june/,Whalewatching in June?,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/tb2sn1/whalewatching_in_june/i05rkjk/,2,r/SaintJohnNB,0,2

"> of course i take it sjpd are vigillant with ticketing you if you're on the sidewalk

What's your source for this? I've always used sidewalks on dangerous roads like Rothesay Ave and Reversing Falls Bridge. The ""bike lanes"" here in Saint John are not actual infrastructure changes. They are just some painted sharrows on existing roads. On roads like Rothesay Ave there isn't even enough room for traffic to observe Ellen's Law. Rothesay Ave is considered a ""Barrier to Cycling"" in official City documents.

Cyclists die or are seriously injured in collisions every year here in Saint John. IMHO it's just not worth the risk.

"Some parts seem to get more wind than others. I live in East SJ and it can get pretty damn windy. In the summer, it's great -- no need for AC if you just open your windows.

I'm up high enough that flooding isn't a big concern but the wind stole an awful lot of my shingles before I got my roof replaced in 2020. There are less windy parts of SJ but I think they're wherever the word ""Heights"" isn't used as the neighbourhood name, or are further away from open water.

Those properties get all their machinery excluded which is valued in the hundreds of millions. The Strathcona refinery pays like 9x more in taxes per year to Alberta and SJ is bigger.

"Checking in from Vancouver here - Rent control (here) is only for the residential side. 

Commercial is MUCH MUCH different. Most leases here are fixed term and some 7 to 10 years sometimes (not Month to month after a year like resi) - owner responsible to pay out whole lease even if they close doors!)  And also commercial comes as tripple threat. So in this case - the bakery would pay the lease, pay the property tax / or their portion depending on sq/ft of the whole property;  and pay all repairs and maintenance. The landlord just collects $$$. We lost near every small business and all we have now are big chains as they are the only ones who can take the loss. 

But you are 100% right that resi rents NEED to be controlled in NB ASAP. Trust me - none of the landlord buyers are real people. They are laundering money from drugs since a smart business person would not pay 3 times asking. They would by 3 units! Vancouver RTB caught them in time (basically because they started using single family homes so the local criminals could get in on it too) but your rents are getting too high for the populations. I pay about the same here as I would in SJ (as your prices are really only 3 years behind ours) and I have been here 5 years (and rent can;t rise more than 2% per year)

"We are in a fantastic location.  We are on the water, but still in the city (in West Saint John).

In terms of cost, you can pretty much have the nicest penthouse condo in the city for $600K.

If you just want a normal 3 bedroom house in a nice location, you can basically buy anything you want for $400K or less.  I think there are maybe a dozen listings in the entire city for more than $500K right now.  Most properties are sub-$300K.  Basically, if it's more than a half-million it's likely a 5+ bedroom with acreage or a penthouse condo in a heritage building.

There's an airport with connections to Montreal and Toronto for overseas flights, and you're within an driving distance of Quebec city, Halifax, Portland and Boston.",t2_pdl98,Scrivener83,0,1645495756.0,0,t1_hxwuw9m,hxwuw9m,False,[deleted],t3_qy7zns,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/qy7zns/any_sw_ontario_to_saint_john_transplants/,Any SW Ontario to Saint John transplants?,/r/SaintJohnNB/comments/qy7zns/any_sw_ontario_to_saint_john_transplants/hxwuw9m/,1,r/SaintJohnNB,0,1
"That is SO amazing! What adorable neighbors 😍

We're working on getting our drivers licenses (adulthood fail; never needed a car in NYC and other big cities we lived in before). Both of us can work remotely so we see no point in paying a significant amount of our salaries towards a mortgage. I'm a bit afraid that the homes in St. John will also go up significantly in $$ by the time we make the move in the next year or so. If my husband and I can have something thats 2+ bedrooms, nature that we can access, the ocean, and travel anywhere we want, I'd say it would be the perfect life.

"I've honestly never met nicer neighbours in my life.  The day we arrived our new neighbours showed up and invited us over for a BBQ because ""you shouldn't have to cook when you just moved in"".

For the price of a 2-bedroom stacked townhouse in Ottawa we bought a 4-bedroom oceanfront home.

Cost of living here with a paid off house we can afford to fly to New York or London whenever we miss the big city.

"I second the YNAB app. I work as a Financial Advisor  and several of my clients use that. You have to be diligent with it though. It is also a paid service I believe too. If that's not an option then just Google budget sheets and you'll get lots of options to you. But like the YNAB app they are only as useful as the effort put into it. As I'm sure you're aware this person needs to start taking their situation seriously or it will not end well for them. 

As for services to help bridge the gap from the 1st to the 4th. There's nothing that's good options for that. Most people turn to payday loans but PLEASE do not let them do that. As a former landlord as well I appreciated when a tenant came to me ahead of time and explained the situation and I would work with them. Now the bridge might already be burned if they have been late so many times and any heads up was not given. 

I would suggest short term pain of cutting something else back for a month if possible to make sure the rent is available in full for the 1st. Yes it will suck for them but it's better then potentially losing their home.

"Not good news. Postmedia is an even bigger monopoly on Canadian media.

That resulted in Kevin Libin, who had played an active role in defeating a union drive at the paper earlier that year,[26] taking charge of all political reporting and analysis in Postmedia newspapers to ensure the newspapers became more ""reliably conservative.""

"The problems SJ has always had were issues with weather (Fog) an higher taxes, and by simply being out of the fog belt, people enjoyed the outskirts more and their cheaper taxes, and ease to build.

There is certainly room to make it more dense (if not get people back into the deserted buildings) but that comes with challenges. AIM plant for one keeping people up at night and the west side water fiasco, are certainly roadblocks to making folks want to come back. 

As for the subburbs - perhaps we have seen enough cul de sac subdivisions, but the surrounding towns of the city are certainly great places to live too.

"Or just buy a nicer house in Saint John… stop this bullshit narrative that people “who can afford it” should live outside the city, while only those who can’t afford it should live in Saint John.

The last thing we need is more of the top income earners in Saint John moving outside the city.  It’s been a big enough problem already, but actually somewhat alleviated by all the people moving here.  I can only imagine the type of shit real estate agents end up telling people to stay out of the city though... I know one of my dad's doctors was basically steered clear of Saint John in favour of Rothesay by the agent that helped find them a house, and I'm sure this happens quite often with high income earners who move here and buy houses. 

(If we didn't have all these new people coming here tho, who haven't been brought up on these stereotypes about the various communities in the greater Saint John area, I'd be ***very*** concerned about the future of the city... if the new people from outside of NB keep coming tho,  I think our city has a very bright future!

If you can afford a nice big house in KV, you can also afford a nice big house in Saint John... until we amalgamate (which may be never), just please cut the fucking snobbery.  I've never lived in a city more divided, or one that had such parasitic suburbs.  It's one of the more unpleasant realities of living here, but selfishness and systemic inequality between the communities here are holding the Saint John Region back as a whole. Just because some people can afford the suburban commuter lifestyle and like it better than living in the city, shouldn't mean that the said city they are a suburb of should suffer. The reality is that mass exodus of Saint John's top income earners from the city to the suburbs over the last 50 years has created vast inequalities between Saint John and its suburbs... this urban flight remains a top cause of Saint John's fiscal troubles... Most of those SJers who moved to KV are never coming back, but people from other parts of Canada or other countries... we can at least do our best to get THEM to come live in Canada's oldest city, even the rich ones who can ""afford"" to live in ""the valley"". 

If we don't get amalgamation anytime soon, we need to actually see some real cooperation and much more meaningful contributions from the surrounding communities for this ""Great Saint John Area"" thing to work properly or even close to ""fairly"".

"Oh yeah, get an agent for sure.


There are so many amazing properties around here that the ""popular"" areas seem to be somewhat arbitrary.
