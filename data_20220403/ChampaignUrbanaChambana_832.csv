Do not buy a mattress from boxdrop you have been warned. All sales final apparently which was not relayed to me and my wife and we didn't sign any paperwork saying this either. We have our copy where we didn't sign this aspect of the agreement. All of a sudden our bed we picked out was delivered. I layed down on it and right away I said this isn't the mattress we ordered. I called them and they said oh sometimes they forget to put the padding in the pillowtop??? Ok yes people make mistakes so I went back and had this mattress replaced because it had no padding at all. It was basically a pillowtop mattress minus the pillowtop. The 2nd bed we received was the same. We told them ok enough is enough and we want to return it and get a refund. They said all sales are final. We then said we never signed anything stating that nor did anyone tell us this because we definitely wouldn't have went that route at all. We showed them the copy of our contract with no signature on the line where it stated all sales are final and then magically they have a contract with our signature which is funny because we have the copy with the signature non existent. Buyers beware of this place or you could be in this same situation. We are fighting them on this because it's weird how a contract we didn't sign all of a sudden has a signature on it. We have the copy without a signature so its weird that they have the original. Someone got clever with a computer and photo shopped it right onto the line. Spend the extra money at a place where you have time to make sure the mattress is definitely what you picked out and ordered. They are most definitely factory defect mattresses. The ones on the showroom floor are for exactly that.....for show.

"In that case, Allerton Park (about 20-30 mins outside of town) is a great place to explore and/or have a family picnic. It’s beautiful in all seasons, and in winter they install holiday lights around the park to enjoy at night.

Curtis Orchard has lots of tasty goodies, pies, apple cider, etc. and they have a play area with a little petting zoo setup (the outdoor area wasn’t fully open last fall, but that might have changed). I think they do seasonal events like pumpkin patches too.

"Welcome!

I think it really depends on your age and interests, or what side of town you're on. The Farmer's markets are great for getting to know local business and folks with similar interests. Depending on your music preferences, Rose Bowl is a great place to check out live music and meet friendly faces. They have all sorts of shows (folk, bluegrass, funk, blues, etc.) and even the occasional comedy nights. Drinks are dirt cheap, but it's fun without them. If beer and breweries are your thing, Blind Pig, Tryptic, and Riggs are worth checking out. Each one has a different vibe, Briggs has a huge outdoor space that's great in the summer and fall.

You have to be pretty disciplined about mowing frequently, not letting your grass get too tall otherwise you leave too many clippings behind.

For the dry spots because of shade, I bought some plastic edging or paver blocks and filled areas around tree bases with mulch.

"Not an answer (sorry!) but I did want to drop in and say, Wow-- housing prices have really gone up a lot in the last few years.

"No problem! I definitely know that feeling! It seems like it’s impossible to find out stuff like that unless you know somebody in the area that’s been around there for a while. You can’t really get a feel for it just looking at places online because they always try to make the pictures and descriptions sound like it’s the best place in the world no matter what lol.

As for looking for rentals, they’re not necessarily hard to find and you would probably find some on Zillow and those sites, but you can check the local newspaper classifieds and find more than what is listed on house sites a lot of the time. Champaign’s paper is called The News Gazette [(link here)](https://www.news-gazette.com/), and Paxton has The Ford County Record [(link here)](https://www.fordcountyrecord.com/classifieds/). 

News Gazette usually will have rentals posted from lots of the surrounding towns like Tolono, Mahomet, Rantoul, etc. since it’s distributed throughout those areas as well.

I definitely understand! South Pointe is on the edge of the old base and while it isn’t the best area, it’s certainly not the worst either. If you’re okay with the higher crime levels for the lower rent costs in the town in general, South Pointe isn’t a bad option.",t2_7wutrc4q,Disastrous_Reality_4,0,1614170206.0,0,t1_gokqxxu,gokqxxu,False,Popular_Ad_5959,t3_l9t6cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chambana/comments/l9t6cf/single_black_female/,single black female,/r/Chambana/comments/l9t6cf/single_black_female/gokqxxu/,2,r/Chambana,0,2
"Thank you so much for all this detail. This is one of the hardest things usually to find is all the town stuff. And I really appreciate that you took the time to respond even though my response to you was literally a sentence lol. 

We are looking to get feelers for the area, is it hard to find rentals in these smaller towns? I'm not good at finding rentals outside of Zillow, Trulia, Zumper. 

A little background: we live in a place with Mahomet prices but probably Rantoul levels of crime. Is it like BAD BAD or just like... generally regarded as bad but ok if you're used to it? I was looking at South Pointe. Can't go wrong with a 5 bedroom townhouse lol. It was the best priced with the best overall reviews. I can deal with maybe people fighting or shooting (as long as it's targeted and not random) as we have gangbangers and stuff rampant here, people who pull car doors to steal from inside, etc etc. Someone got stabbed behind my building and now we have cameras 🙄 but I've never felt actually unsafe here? There's also areas up north that are similar where if you have a car it's OK but don't walk lol. edit: also my husband was changing our car brakes and teenagers circled around him like vultures hoping to steal and a guy borrowed his pliers then stole em too lol.

"Ahh okay, that definitely makes sense. Tolono is probably going to be cheaper to live than Mahomet. 

Fisher is also a nice small town - it’s directly west of Rantoul about 7-8 miles, so roughly 10-12 miles north of Champaign. I lived there for several years and it was priced similar to Rantoul. Because it’s a lot smaller, though, they don’t have the crime issues that Rantoul has. 

They don’t have a ton as far as store/restaurants, but they have a grade school and high school, a Dollar General for basics, a gas station...all the stuff to get the necessities without having to go all the way to Rantoul or Champaign. The schools there are wonderful as well.

Another option would be Paxton. It’s about 25-30 miles north of Champaign, straight up I-57. Smaller town like Fisher. The rent/housing prices are definitely cheaper than Champaign or Mahomet, and it’s a nice little town if you don’t mind driving a bit further.",t2_7wutrc4q,Disastrous_Reality_4,0,1614141489.0,0,t1_gojsduv,gojsduv,False,Popular_Ad_5959,t3_l9t6cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chambana/comments/l9t6cf/single_black_female/,single black female,/r/Chambana/comments/l9t6cf/single_black_female/gojsduv/,2,r/Chambana,0,2

"If you’re looking for small towns near Champaign-Urbana that would be best for raising kids, I would suggest Tolono or Mahomet - definitely not Rantoul! Rantoul has gone waaaay downhill in the last 20 or so years. Once the old military base closed they turned most of it into “affordable housing” and it’s been that way ever since. The crime rate and drug use have significantly climbed over the years, and while there are some better areas, the town as a whole is not great, especially when it comes to raising children there.

Tolono is 7-8 miles south of Champaign and Mahomet is 7-8 miles west of Champaign and both have much, MUCH better schools, child care, and more family friendly activities than Rantoul would have. Another option would be St. Joseph, which is like 15 or so miles east of Urbana so it’s a bit further, but they also have better schools and more family oriented things than Rantoul would have.

Edit: For reference, I have lived in the Chambana area or surrounding small towns my entire life and of all of the small towns surrounding it, Rantoul is the only one that I would not consider living *under any circumstances* after watching it decline over the years and seeing some of the things that have happened there. Even before I had my daughter I wouldn’t have lived there, and now that I have a kid that stance has intensified tenfold.",t2_7wutrc4q,Disastrous_Reality_4,0,1614095538.0,0,t1_gogyx2q,gogyx2q,False,Popular_Ad_5959,t3_l9t6cf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chambana/comments/l9t6cf/single_black_female/,single black female,/r/Chambana/comments/l9t6cf/single_black_female/gogyx2q/,3,r/Chambana,0,3

"I wouldn't call Rantoul a suburb of C-U.  As a former military town some distance away, Rantoul is strikes me as its own thing.

It is within commuting distance of C-U, though.

Back when I worked at UIUC, one of my colleagues commuted from Rantoul on the Thomosboro Slab every day, and he liked living there.  He never really explained why he liked living there, but the military moved him there before the base closed -- and I gathered that he just happened to really like his neighbors.  That's a pretty good reason to live there!

When I first moved here, the distinction between Urbana and Champaign seemed silly.  Twelve years later, I'm definitely ""Urbana people"", and Rantoul seems pretty far away.

This whole area is a special place to live, though!

"C-U is another medium sized college town.

I don't have direct experience in being black or single in C-U, but it's very liberal, and most of us go out of our way to be very welcoming anyone and everyone.

If you're not a college student, this is a much smaller town than it appears.  My now-wife and I moved here in our 30s and we are raising kids here in our 40s, and this is a small town as far as the parenting community goes.  But our fellow kid-people are people we genuinely like and respect (and small-talk often starts with ""so, tell me about your research""), so it's a great place to be.

Regardless of what you look like or where you come from, this is a great place a nerd!  That's why we moved here, and why we continue to live here.

If you're the college town life, I'd love to have you as my neighbor!

"Welcome to the C-U! And congrats on the new job. Carle is a fantastic place to work. 

Champaign-Urbana (add Savoy too really) to me is a fantastic place to live at any age, but particularly your mid-20's. Other people have mentioned the downtown/bar scene, but don't think that just means drinking. There's so much live music and entertainment spread across both downtown Champ and downtown Urbana (well, there was, but you know what I mean; someday again). 

For being in central Illinois I think we have the perfect town. A ton of art and culture (thanks in large part to the diversity brought in by the University) for a smaller town. You get a lot of the vibe of a city, along with the quietness and easy access to nature of a rural community. 

The food options here are ridiculous if you're a foodie as well. There's plenty of parks, if you're moving to SW Champaign I highly, highly suggest Robeson Park and all the connecting bike trails. There's also as people have mentioned a plethora of churches, including several in SW area. I can't speak much on it as that's not my thing, but I know you won't be lacking in options as others have attested.

Honestly, I absolutely love this place. I think you will too. I've lived in a few places and I always couldn't wait to get back here. Welcome again! And good luck with everything!

"I would recommend looking on Zillow— you can type in the parameters you want and it will come up with what fits your price range and needs. They have an app you can download. There are a lot of smaller apartment buildings in Urbana, away from campus (or near, if that’s what you need!) that aren’t much different in price. And they are much better maintained than this huge complex.

"I’ve lived here for seven years now, and I wouldn’t recommend it anymore. The place is a dump. It is not well maintained, office staff are rude, there is trash everywhere, dirt patches all over the place, parking lots a mess, several shootings this year, crime has skyrocketed... the only reason I am still here is because of a lease. 

The rent is cheap, but the management is just horrible. Most of the buzzers to get in the buildings are broken, so you can’t buzz anyone in. They aren’t going to fix them, because they are so old and can’t get the parts. So most of the time people just leave the doors propped open. Delivery companies leave packages in the lobbies of building and they get stolen. Management doesn’t care. There are liquor bottles lying on the ground and cigarette butts in lobbies... washers and dryers in the laundry rooms take 2-3 cycles to get clothes dry... I could go on and on.

"I think u/concretebox gave an excellent answer. I'm guessing you'll be at either Carle on Curtis or Carle at the Fields. Mostly they both are near single family homes that will be cheap given most Chicago prices and rents, but you most likely will be surrounded by families for the most part, so you'd have to look elsewhere for interactions with people in your age group and social/professional situation.

Carle at the Fields is building a bunch of condominiums that are very new (just about eight months old) but seem to be attracting young, single professionals. Also, very nearby and connected by sidewalk (and soon to be better connected) to Carle at the Fields are the Windsor West (eco-)apartments (which, as far as I can tell are eco only because they use geothermal heating and cooling (nice, but not a huge deal). No condos or apartments are within walking distance of Carle on Curtis, but since you likely have a car and parking at most apartments outside of campustown is free, that probably isn't a deal breaker. 

I also thought I may add that you need not be in a rush to buy a home. I've always rented for a year or two to figure out what part of town I wanted to live in, and I recommend that to others too. Nothing sucks more than buying in the wrong part of town. Also, Champaign and Urbana have very low rates of appreciation on houses. We build new homes so fast that previously-owned ones don't go up in price like they do in Chicagoland or California (well, that place is crazy), etc. So, trying out a part of town for a year is no big deal.

As to buying, I'll also second the notion that buying outside Champaign city limits is worth considering. Property taxes are high in Champaign and they keep increasing. Moving to Savoy from Champaign cut the taxes on a house with the same exterior and floor plan cut taxes $6000 per year, and moving to unincorporated Champaign County will cut taxes by almost two-thirds (though that wasn't by the same builder and is similar only in size). I don't know what you'll be making at Carle (and I'm not asking), but to me that is real money.

I'll also add that I agree that finding a church home is pretty easy. People are often somewhat quiet (don't like to talk) about their churches, but try them out. Most are highly welcoming, and every faith denomination I can think of has at least one and often many. Plus, there are a lot of religious organizations that you can attend or join where people will talk about their church (even within a denomination). So at these it is easy to learn about, as an example) which of the local Catholic churches may be the best fit. (Same holds for Lutheran organizations, Methodist, etc.)

It's an easy place to live. Welcome to C-U.

PS: I didn't mention Urbana. It too has a lot to offer and is adjacent.

"Oh, yeah, the ID requirement.  Interesting point.

The only rationale I could come up with is if they were told to go check certain houses, and rather than doing their full job and wearing proper ID, they used their phone to prove to their supervisor that they did go to a house.

"I can explain what happened as I learned from an employee however I may be getting some facts incorrect because *my memory is not super great.* 

**Background**: The Clark Bar was bought by two new people in the last 12 months, who were both Caucasian men, I believe. This has all seeming OK until the coronavirus shut down our county/state, and employees were sent home. While on lockdown they continued to get paid, which to my understanding was a consensus. 

**Initial complaint**: Here's where it gets important but also more fuzzy for me, so I really might be getting some of this wrong! There is one waitress was told at some point in the recent past that they were cutting her pay, or that she needed to come in, or some other change in the agreement which she did not consent to. I am not 100% clear on what happened but when she refused, they threatened legal action for pack pay, which is illegal and not at all how this works. **For what it's worth she is also the only black employee from what I can remember.** 

**accusations accumulate**: She posted about this situation on Facebook, but does not outright accuse the owners of racism. However in the comments, other people began to share stories of their experiences and soon formed a strong body of evidence that at least one of the owners is a racist, be it intentional or not. To the best of my understanding these people were commenting on their own prior experiences with these owners. 

**A self inflicted Meltdown**: One of the owners (I think perhaps the one who was not directly accused?) shows up in the thread on Facebook and decides it's a good time to drop an ""all lives matter"" comment which for most is now understood to be a dismissal of the harm perpetrated by racists in America. Before long people are threatening to throw a brick in the window and come over a start a fight etc.

**Aftermath**: Some of the folks who work there don't want to come in for fear someone might really be crazy enough to show up and threaten them. Furthermore, from what I heard, the employees have lost all respect for these owners and couldn't care less if they lose their business over this.

edit: Ok I found the post you mentioned and it is here below:
>We regret to inform you that Oh, Honey Pie will no longer be selling our pies to the Clark Bar in Champaign. We are eternally grateful for the humble beginnings that the original owner, Lynda and her family, gave us. The Clark Bar was always that place you could go to and be accepted for who you are, no matter the color of your skin, your nationality, gender, or sexual preference. I hope it can once again return to the core values it once stood for: togetherness, compassion, and valuing human lives over profit.

>We at Oh, Honey Pie believe that Black Lives Matter. Period. We fully recognize our own privilege which has enabled us to build up this business over the past two years, and we commit to doing our best to stand up for equal rights in our country and in our community.

>If you would like to do the same, please head over to Buy Black Chambana for a list of locally owned Black businesses that you can support. Some of our favorites are: Plant Mode, Stango Cuisine, C&C Kitchen, and Come Get This food truck.

> *Tom, There is something that has been bugging me for years. Behind the Refinery on John Street and along Kenwood Road is a large white building or factory.*

> *1) What is it? and 2) Is it still used?*

> *I have always wondered and if it's not used, which seems to be the case, is there any plan to tear it down?*

> That's the former C.S. Johnson/Johnson-Ross plant, a building with a notable history not just locally but worldwide.

> Charles S. Johnson was a civil engineer at the University of Illinois who founded the company in 1921 and ""developed and patented a number of aggregate storing and batching designs for the booming highway industry,"" according to the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, which put Johnson (1877-1941) in its hall of fame in 1993.

> ""Johnson's most visible and noteworthy achievement was the engineering, design and layout of the storage, batching and mixing plant for the Hoover Dam project,"" says his entry in the Construction Equipment Hall of Fame. ""This mammoth undertaking would yield nearly 4.5 million cubic yards of concrete for what became one of the seven wonders of the world. His design featured a multi-weigh hopper and scale system with a tilting mixer, which accelerated the speed of both batching and mixing operations. This plant turned out to be the first ever fully automated plant for producing mass concrete, and was especially unique for its placement within the narrow confines of the Black Canyon.

> ""Charles Johnson's innovations at the Hoover Dam set the criteria for hydro-electric plants on an international scale, serving as guidelines for the U.S. Corps of Engineers and Bureau of Reclamation specifications.""

> For decades, about 90 percent of all mass-poured concrete in the U.S. was created with Johnson equipment, according to CMI Corp., which acquired C.S. Johnson in 1997.

> The plant, at 502 Kenwood Road, is on 9 acres. It closed about 10 years ago [2005] and now is owned by Erwin Goldfarb and apparently is used as warehouse space for Goldfarb's apartment operations in Champaign-Urbana.

> I wasn't successful getting anyone from Goldfarb's firm, Campus Property Management, to discuss its plans for the site.

"Welcome to Chambana! CU has a very active grey community.

American Greyhounds has a monthly meet-up on the first Saturday of the month at Rural King from 12-2. They also host other events, although we haven't been a part of any of them. Would be a great place to go to meet new dog friends and find dog-sitting exchanges.

If you want to make a trip up to Chicago, Regap (https://regapgreyhounds.org/) has a lot of events, and MGA (http://www.midwestgreyhound.org/current-adoptables) has a formal dogsitting exchange program that is active in CU.

For our vet, we use Animal Hospital at the Crossings. Dr. Davis had worked previously in Florida almost exclusively with greyhounds. He is very knowledgeable about the breed. While I'm sure there are other good vets in town, we called around when we rescued our grey and Dr. Davis had the most experience.

If your grey is dog-park friendly, we recommend using the Urbana dog park. It is larger and there is more room to run (or to vacate a situation that makes your pup uncomfortable). Note that there is a small annual fee for both the Urbana and Champaign dog parks that you can pay at their offices.",t2_11h0b4,SpearowPhisher,0,1522157188.0,0,t1_dwd0n04,dwd0n04,True,greyhoundsrfast,t3_87aqui,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chambana/comments/87aqui/greyhound_owners/,Greyhound owners?,/r/Chambana/comments/87aqui/greyhound_owners/dwd0n04/,3,r/Chambana,0,3

"Welcome to the greatest place on Earth :D

Seems like lots of people are just giving you advice on a few small areas of town to stay away from.

Here's what they aren't telling you:

**Chambana has great nightlife** - go to downtown Champaign pretty much any night of the week and find an assortment of great restaurants and bars. We have multiple local breweries as well!

**There is an amazing history of tech innovation here** - Many important developments in the history of tech and the Internet were made here. However my favorite one is fictional: [HAL 9000 was born in Urbana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgkyrW2NiwM)


**We have an amazingly supportive art community** - I have never seen anything like it in a town this size. An incredibly active filmmaking community, sculptures *everywhere* around town, a great local stand-up comedy scene, as well as a world class music festival every fall - [Pygmalion](http://www.thepygmalionfestival.com/) (which now features music/food/literature/tech and more)

**Not much traffic** - people who have always lived here take this for granted sometimes I think. Everything is just 15 minutes away!

**The Art Theater** - [The Art Theater](http://www.arttheater.coop/) plays great movie both past and present almost every night of the week. Classics, cult favorites, holiday movies, oscar lists, and even new releases!

Plus, you know, midwestern charm or whatever.

For music stores, there's guitar center on North prospect, as well as a couple local places. I'd recommend The Upper Bout on Neil, a friend of mine owns that shop. They're all really nice people over there who also do lessons.

* Take a look at the CU Mass Transit District route maps. Part of your wife's student fees include a bus subsidy s/t she'll only need to flash her student ID in order to board. (Each trip is $1 otherwise.)

1. Folks affiliated w/ the library school maintain something of an unofficial FAQ re: off-campus topics, but I don't have the URL handy. If your wife has any contacts within her department, they might be able to direct her to something similar.

No, depending on where you're from and your expectations, it's pretty crappy here.  Many things are also dead because it's spring break.

"Hi Chambana folks,

My name is psuppak, I am one of the organizers for the GSI Experiment that will be running all summer long. Below is some details about us. Please feel free to post any question in the comments. You can also email us or call us during business hours.

WHY? Our lab wants to create landscapes that are healthy for the environment and for humans. By participating in this study, you will help us design healthier landscapes.

HOW? You will come to our lab for a 60-minute experiment. You will take some math and attention tests, give a short speech, and then watch a short video containing images of stormwater landscapes. We will measure your stress and attention levels before and after you watch the video and you will complete a questionnaire.

WHO? Anyone between the ages of 18-32 who has lived in the US for more than 5 years may participate. You cannot participate if you have a history of PTSD, depression, ADD/ADHD, or cardiovascular disease, or if you are currently taking medication (birth control/multivitamins are okay).

Again, have a great summer and check us out!

"You might take a look at the [Taylor's](http://www.taylor-realty.com/) website. They've been doing real estate for a while and handle rentals and home purchases. There are several really nice neighborhoods around Champaign-Urbana, and lots of new development too. Another thing to consider is that there are literally dozens of apartment high rises being built on campus right now. I had a day off and toured one of the high rises a few years back with my kids and was pretty impressed. It would definitely be a nice stay until you pick a home. I toured [Burnam 310](http://burnham310.com/) which is walking distance to the engineering quad.

"If you're working in Rantoul, you may want to check out homes/apartments near Urbana's downtown.  I'm a current Champaign resident that lived in Urbana for a year so I can't offer much insight other than I personally prefer Urbana's historic charm to Champaign's.  

We've rented through Champaign County Realty in the past (only for a year).  There's a duplex on their website that's actually the same place we stayed!  The area is a bit sketchy, but we personally never ran into any issues.  It's not within walking distance of downtown, either.

"Thanks so much for the tip on Wampler Apts. I will definitely contact them. And for the bit of Rantoul history! I did hear about the air force base, and I can see how that kinda shut the whole place down. I did stop at a nice little coffee shop, although it was a bit odd because it also seemed to double as some sort of religious recruitment center? But I'll just brush that under the rug.

"Sure, try Wampler Apartments. They have a nice website that lets you enter your criteria. Be sure to select ""downtown"" for the area (the other two choices are ""campus"" and ""off campus""). I can neither recommend or not-recommend them because I've never had any experience with them, but they seem to be a decent rental company with lots of properties in really cool buildings downtown.

Rantoul, unfortunately, is on the downturn. When the air force base closed there back in the 1990s, all the military housing was sold, and a lot of slumlords bought up the places cheap. I'll leave it to your imagination as to what the current residents of those places are like. Some of the people I work with are longtime residents of Rantoul and remember the good days when the town was thriving. Not to say that it's totally the 'hood now. There are still many hardworking, decent people living in Rantoul, and a couple of nicer residential areas.

The town has few decent restaurants --  mainly fast food and pizza, and not much shopping other than Walmart. 

Do try Ott's Diner, though, for the old-timey, small-town diner experience. They've got great food. The longtime owners are selling the place and closing in July, but there's a good chance someone will buy it and keep it going. Oh, also, there's Sol Azteca. My favorite Mexican restaurant. It's run by some former migrant workers (I believe) who decided to settle permanently in Rantoul.

Another good thing is the gym that's owned by the park district. The town bought the military's gym and now runs it. I think membership is something like $30 a  month. They don't have a pool but they have cardio, weights, and an inside running track.
