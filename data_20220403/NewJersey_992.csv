"Reasons I personally believe why school districts are good:

* Adequate funding (For good quality teachers, lower class sizes, etc.)
* Smart people on the school boards that help shape the curriculum and allocate funds smartly and not to blow it all on useless shit
* Good parents - you don't necessarily have to be rich, you just need to prioritize your kids education and have enough time to pay enough attention to them so they aren't stealing, doing drugs, etc. and are focusing on growing academically/sports/etc.

There was a NYT reporter that interviewed low income families in NYC. They found that low-income asian parents sacrificed more to prioritize their kid's education when compared to low-income white / black parents. Culture plays a huge role and you want to be in a town where all parents are dedicated to their kid's achievement. That way the kids grow up around other smart kids and they can push each other to excel in life. They'll also grow up around smart adults who are successful and serve as good role models.

">You also fly it to ""threaten the government""?

Yep. The US government doesn't have the greatest track record when it comes to people's rights. I also have a sticker with the same image that says ""armed minorities are harder to oppress"". 

>And you feel safe

Very. Part of the point of the flag is to say I'm willing to defend things that are important to me. And it's supposed to serve as a warning, much like the rattle of the snake on it. 

>Sounds like you really need to figure out your whole flag game dude.

I've spent sometime reading about each flag I have purchased and fly. I am prepared to give anyone that asks a comprehensive oral history of each flag and enjoy doing it. I do need to change my flag for this month, so you are right in that aspect. But just that aspect. 

>But what about the guy who drives past the day you are flying the ""fuck off US gov"" flag?

I'm an adult and I stopped caring what people that I have no relationships with think of me around 7th grade. And it's not just the US government. State governments sometimes need to be told to fuck off too.

These are four years where you can become independent, explore interests and lay the foundations for adulthood. Get out there and see something new. Meet new people. Get a new perspective. This is important developmental time. When you get out of school, get your foot in the door and figure out how to escalate in your organization. Live somewhere you can afford.

"I grew up a few blocks from “the shore” and now I live about a mile away. I don’t think it’s great to visit but I think it’s great to live here. Small town charm with Main Street shops (spring lake, manasquan) is good for biking around town,  walking on the boardwalk, watching the sunrise, etc. 

But actually going to the beach? Point Pleasant charges you an arm and a leg for parking, then you pay for the beach itself (which they close and LOCK after 6pm — a publicly funded beach is closed… to the public), and then if you dare to eat on the boardwalk you’re paying $12 for a kids portion of Mac and cheese… $34 for a plain pizza.

"It *will* ""harm"" the top schools on average because they would no longer be filled with privileged wealthy kids (assuming this new combined system allowed for students to essentially go anywhere). The schools would have to accept lower performing students. Any ""top performing"" school is usually in that class because they can cut out the bottom half, not because the top students are actually any better.

So the question is, would it hurt the top *students*? I would wager to say no. Diversity in ethnic background, age, and economic status raise up everyone involved.

Think about a full gentrification cycle:

1. Large, low income families live in a neighborhood. All the kids go to the schools which aren't very good.
2. Middle class smaller families move in. Schools start to get better and the cost to live in the neighborhood goes up. Low income gets pushed out (and many students).
3. High income families move in for the now good schools. Neighborhood gets more expensive. Now young families can barely afford to live there, only older people whose kids have probably moved out.
4. The wealthy families who don't use the schools anymore start to vote down the school budget. Less kids go there and it can't get funding anymore. The school system gets worse due to the demographics of the town.

I am not personally against gentrification and that process doesn't happen overnight, but it does happen.

"Unfortunately, not really. The biggest impact politics has in our country is on a national/federal level. It’d be nice if local communities were emphasized more but senators, congress people, and federal judges (despite being voted in “locally”) hold power on a national level. And more often than not these days these people are in it for decades while making loads of money off our taxes. 

If it’s not disconcerting that these people go into office with very little money and then after decades have hundreds of millions of dollars then that’s unfortunate. What’s even more unfortunate is instead of seeing this people nowadays are focused on stupid social media. I stand by what I said- a mayors irrelevant wife is exactly that: irrelevant. There are bigger issues in this country than some irrelevant spouse of an irrelevant mayor. Like perhaps the racist stuff presidents like Trump, Bush, Biden, and Bill Clinton have said. They’re all cut from the same cloth. When will people wake up from the divide and conquer tactics being used?

"I personally don't vote for either of them as they serve the same people and only difference is the wedge issue nonsense. The focus is rarely (IF EVER) about anything that truly enriches or improves the well-being or material wealth of the average American citizen or American family. In my opinion the democrats are worse. The total hypocrisy of not allowing choice and forcing mandates. The clearest display of government dictating freedom of speech. And Trump was a liar too. Remember all Trump Healthcare that he kept telling us would be ""just another week"". Surprise! The giant corporate tax cut and how he insultingly said  ""the next one is for the middle!"" Its all bullshit. but cultural issues - the democrats are plain insufferable. The republicans - also liars, but more like giant phony hypocrites who like to pick and choose which rules they claim to follow and which ones to bend, and its who they bend the rules for that is the most telling. Let me give you a hint; Its not the American people who benefit economically! Remember that they sent billions to Israel and Ukraine. That money belongs here - improving the lives of Americans. Improving our citizen's lives. Educating your kids, renewing our infrastructure, funding GOOD job training programs for those who decide not to go to college. Showing value to the trade jobs and doing things to increase pay. If it was good enough for Israel, Ukraine, and all these scam artists our politicians and corporate execs have sold out to - then that money should be even better spent here in America.

"I’m surprised that you got that pic. Ospreys are very human-shy, and will abandon a meal to fly away when humans are nearby.
Little-remembered fact: Ospreys were driven to the brink of extinction by the use of DDT, a now-discontinued pesticide made by a multitude of US chemical companies. DDT is cumulative in animal tissue and the DDT that washed from farmlands to rivers accumulated in fish that were then eaten by Ospreys. The effect was weakening of the Osprey’s egg shells, so that they broke during gestation and very few hatched. The ones that did hatch were born with near-lethal concentrations of DDT in their tissues, which led to shortened survival times. After death, those birds’ carcasses were often consumed by carrion-eating birds who then absorbed the DDT in their bodies. Thus DDT remains in the wild food chain decades after it was banned.",t2_jqv4xdtw,RubberChickenRacing,0,1649002630.0,0,t1_i38kydw,i38kydw,True,Rory-mcfc,t3_tuun4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/tuun4t/saw_an_osprey_eating_a_fish_up_in_a_tree_in_new/,Saw an Osprey eating a fish up in a tree in New Milford,/r/newjersey/comments/tuun4t/saw_an_osprey_eating_a_fish_up_in_a_tree_in_new/i38kydw/,1,r/newjersey,0,1

"more than likely whatever you are venting into is 4"" or greater already, so its just some cheap ductwork that needs to be replaced. Its usually not a big deal.

The law SHOULD have been changed way back when, but is a bit overkill at this point, because with newer units they burn so cleanly and hold their heat efficiently so burn less that you would be hard pressed to get a reading with a sniffer even if you didn't vent it (don't do this).

MAYBE if you have wherever your water heater in heavily finished, they might have to bust up some drywall, but that should be the extent of it.

Also consider the tankless stuff (kind of tough to get a good price if you need one NOW). Depending on where yours is located, it may not require an extensive retrofit, they aren't THAT much more expensive than a good tank one, especially after credits depending on your utility, and will pay for themselves over their lifetime.

"So I just moved to the New Brunswick area last September and it was brutal. There really wasn’t much available under $2k/month for a 1 bedroom. I landed a “luxury” apartment and as others have said the luxury just means it’s new construction and has amenities like some pool tables and a small gym.

My theory is because the housing market is through the roof, a lot of people have sold their homes and are renting until home prices go back down and then they will buy another house.

But the whole thing makes me pretty angry. My rent is 50% of my net income and the only reason I moved into this apartment was because it was honestly the cheapest thing I could find that wasn’t a scam",t2_ftkwfyx9,BreadHead911,0,1648998567.0,0,t1_i38bfo7,i38bfo7,True,Lookmeeeeeee,t3_tv9yv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/newjersey/comments/tv9yv8/why_are_there_so_many_luxury_apartments_in_nj/,"Why are there so many ""luxury apartments"" in NJ near the NY area?

"Typical “victim” attitude. 

Clark residents, you have the power to remove this person. From the 1993 act which allows town residents to remove someone fro local office:

“Three residents must file a notice of intention to recall the politician with the election official for the district. The official will review it within three business days and notify the targeted person of the recall.

Once the petition is approved, the recall committee has 160 days to collect signatures from 25 percent of the registered voters in the district.”

The mayor will probably use the town’s legal team to represent him at the taxpayer’s expense. To combat that you could have a not-for profit represent the citizens (ACLU etc).

"It varies by insurance company, but all insurance companies have some form of territory rating. Territories can be defined by zip code, county, or geo coding.

The increase or decrease associated with each territory will vary by coverage. The amount of increase and decrease are driven by things like frequency of accidents (highly correlated with population density), and severity of accident (more volatile, but related to speed limits and medical costs).

If you're moving from a low density to high density area, then you're likely to some fluctuations (likely increases) in your premium, but difficult to quantify, because a move between counties may keep you in the same territory.

Fun fact, auto insurers must file the rates and rules used to determine your premium with each states department of insurance. Those rates must be mathematically justified and are scrutinized by the department. If you felt the need, then you could look up your auto insurance companies current rate manual and check the factors yourself. You could even look up the math used to justify the rates they're using.

I know some contractors talked you into a whole French drain system but they are also trying to get 10k worth of work out of you.

Get a big plastic drum and drill holes in it so water can get in dig a hole in your basement floor and put the drum in it. Sump pump in there drum with a hose outside. When you are better off financially you can hire someone to finish it's off better. I grew up with a wet basement and moved into a house with one.
