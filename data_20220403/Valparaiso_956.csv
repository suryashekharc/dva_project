"Homes in the 150-300k range. 

The rule of thumb is that you should not buy more house than 2.5-3x your income. The median household income is $63,000. That means the average Valpo residents can only responsibly afford a $190,000 home.

There is nothing under $250k now except for absolute overpriced junk and even the $250k is shit. Of course the current situation changes somethings. However new homes are all north of $350-400k. There are no new construction for working class. 

Valpo has enough section 8 in my opinion. But nothing for normal people. 

I've been looking for a house for 3 years. Everytime I find something, I get out bid by cash offers from Chicagoans or flippers trying to destroy another house with vinyl ""wood"" floors, junk contractor grade white kitchens, and grey paint. Then the house is later priced at 100-150k more, for maybe 40-60k worth of renos that are shit.",t2_85kt3,jheins3,0,1647289562.0,0,t1_i0nufv4,i0nufv4,False,drizzfoshizz,t3_sb9qtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Valparaiso/comments/sb9qtk/feelings_on_the_new_apartment_buildings_downtown/,Feelings on the new apartment buildings downtown?,/r/Valparaiso/comments/sb9qtk/feelings_on_the_new_apartment_buildings_downtown/i0nufv4/,1,r/Valparaiso,0,1

"A lot of northwest indiana towns have been doing weekend events in their parks every week, some towns including Hobart, Valpo, Crown Point, Schererville, Griffith i know have all done them. These little events include live music, vendors, drinks at some, they may be a good place to step out and meet some people, although i'm not sure how long they are all going on since it seems to be a summer thing.  If you google search ""nwi town planner"" it may help give some insight to things happening in the area to check out.

There is also the r/nwi subreddit, but sometimes it isn't as lively as i'd hope it to be.

"> So on MLK Day or Lincoln’s birthday, should we do a recreation of their assassinations? On Memorial Day, Japanese planes bombing Pearl Harbor?

Sure, if you want. I wouldn't be against it, historical moments need to be remembered in their entirety, not censored or torn down. 

Should we tear down Holocaust museums because they're too detailed? 

>it would have sent a stronger message

I'm not sure a generic, tame twin tower display would go viral. The beauty of the float is the accuracy of the horrible events that happened, which is why 9-11 should be ""Never Forgotten"" in the first place. Nobody forced you or your friend to dwell on a single parade float so much.

>Republican

You can respect and remember the fallen without recreating the horrific terrorist attack.

The judge threw the book at him and gave him 4 years just on the Latin King Charges and now he is in DC waiting for trial on the January 6th charges.

There were corn stalks on the back that had red paint all over them. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be fire or blood or something else. It looked like blood to me. Either way, WTF? Amazing.

I'm very sorry this situation is now a huge misunderstanding but you scared the shit out of our entire family.

"Duffy's or Franklin House. The ""college crowd"" sorta rotates through those depending on the night.

"Its sad to say, but the fact that it was the closest kind of attack to a murderer without being a murder. So the police don't have to treat it like one. If a murder goes unsolved that's a bad stat. But this fits nicely into an assault- no big deal if that can't solve every assault in town.  If they asked everyone in the apartment complex they would have found something.

"> The immune response, including duration of immunity, to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet understood. Patients infected with other betacoronaviruses (MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43), the genus to which SARS-CoV-2 belongs, are unlikely to be re-infected shortly (e.g., 3 months or more) after they recover. However, more information is needed to know whether similar immune protection will be observed for patients with COVID-19.

UNLIKELY, being the key word. That doesn't rule it out. The virus has existed for a while now and there's no way of knowing how long the antibodies will last.

There's absolutely no reason to go to something as unimportant as a concert, or to dine in as crowded restaurants, which most of the ones downtown are. I was down there last week and saw a small percentage with masks on. Many that did have them on weren't covering their noses properly or lowered them to speak.

"Everything I have seen by people’s accounts - it’s how he wants to live.  I believe his name is Robert and there were some Facebook posts about him celebrating Thanksgiving with a local family this past year.  Sometimes people try to offer him things and he turns them down because it’s stuff he doesn’t need and obviously he’s slightly limited on space.  Then people get ticked off he didn’t accept their charity and say that he’s rude.

I don’t know how he came to his current situation, but it seems to be what he wants to be doing, and has been doing for years.  He doesn’t seem to want to be anyone’s charity case and likely the best thing you can do for him if you happen to cross paths is just ask him how he’s doing and have a conversation.",t2_11k1ba,Sensibility81,0,1580157850.0,0,t1_ffrgz20,ffrgz20,True,cheeseman42,t3_eutpgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Valparaiso/comments/eutpgu/homeless_man_on_us_30/,Homeless man on US 30,/r/Valparaiso/comments/eutpgu/homeless_man_on_us_30/ffrgz20/,11,r/Valparaiso,0,11

"Well, now, thank you, sir/madam for the well wishes! And I really hope you didn't take what I said as a *slight against you,* the only time I hit back against someone personally, rather than their argument, is when somebody I'm talking to throws the ""first punch"", so to speak. But, I do want to say that it frustrates me to no end that we've had to deal with quite a few surrogates for the Republican party who have complained that we're going to make Valparaiso into Gary, or that we're talking about bringing Section 8 housing into the city, or that we are trying to attack financial success. Instead, we want to keep Valparaiso a city where working class people can still afford to live, we want to make sure that the housing supply is adequate for the demand at various price-points, and we want to make sure that we aren't catalyzing distortions of the market.   


Don't worry about the conversation being difficult because it's an immensely nuanced topic since there are so many different factors, national and local, that affect it. I'm attaching to this post via an imgur link a bar graph that shows how many new construction properties have been created every year since 2012 in Center Township at $50,000 price intervals, starting at $100,000\^Source is GniarMLS. As you can see the vast majority of new construction homes within the last 7 years have sold above the $250,000 price-point. The median housing value within Valparaiso is only $175,000, and the median household income is approximately $52,500. Even being generous with a $60,000 income and a down payment of $40,000, you're still likely only going to be able to afford, at max, a home in the price range of $210,000 - $230,000.   


Now, this becomes a real problem as our city continues to grow in population since the current supply of housing below the $250,000 price-point is not increasing in parallel to the demand and the supply is relegated to the the older neighborhoods directly surrounding the downtown area. So, I have an issue when the city starts developing in those older neighborhoods by incentivizing luxury condominium builds that start in price at $290,000+. We're pricing out current residents and the middle income demand that exists while claiming that these constructions are ""market rate"" when in actuality they're high-end subsidized housing.

"What is affordable housing? Honestly, I’m not a Republican or Democrat.  My views are independent of party affiliation. Trying to wrap my head around the platform of “Affordable Housing” is more difficult than I would like it to be. It is relative. I’m not sad about the diversity that exists in my Banta neighborhood. But, just because some developed and former blighted/abandoned property near downtown is rumored to be for sale for a price higher than I could afford does not scare me. 
Nothing ever stays the same. We live in a free market society, and I agree that incentives to a property development project that does not create jobs, is wrong. 
I am not unpleased to call Valparaiso home. I have lived in other communities, which has helped me appreciate it even more.

"As you stated, housing is becoming out of reach for many working people in this city. All our candidates are demanding is that we stop incentivizing ""luxury condos"". We're also for taking a look at our zoning codes and removing the city as an obstacle for contractors that are looking to build at a more modest price point.

"This notion of “affordable housing” is BS.

"I think you're on the right track - using a home inspector from a source that you trust. I ended up having to go with another home inspector, my realtor's 2nd choice, and I am sorry that I did.

Again, this is only my opinion.

However, things that I would want checked as I move forward would be:

\-Moisture in a crawl space and/or basement (\*you usually pay more for this.. or a mold check)

\-Standard check of HVAC, Dishwasher, appliances - these guys aren't going to be HVAC professionals usually, but I'd get them to try to validate that your HVAC is up to code or sign off that it is (this might be a hard sell).

\-Quality of flooring (pops.. loose tiles... damage...) and lumber underneath your house/condo, if it is easy enough to see.

\-Thickness of insulation in the attic.

\-Do your windows open? Do they open easily?

\-Leaks under all of your faucets, do they look corroded, check for moisture under these.

\-If you can see from underneath, inspect the sub floor for any water leaks (or damaged sub floor) near your toilets, entry doors, etc.

\-The seal of your doors and windows-Are your electrical plugs loose? I never thought of this, but almost all of mine were able to be pressed into the wall and I had to have this remediated.

\- Do you see any crumbling brick and/or broken siding?

\- Any signs of leaking gutters (esp. near joints/seams). look for damage around your gutters, such as soft wood or broken siding.

"I just took my 13-year-old there on my wife's suggestion to ""go play some video games"" which is funny because all the games now are gambling ticket games. We decided to play mini-golf and what a garbage course that is. Some of the holes still have the same busted up concrete blocks from when I was thirteen. The scorecard is so cheap it doesn't even say Zao Island on it, and in the ""Par"" column it is blank. Like, just make up your own par? No, you tell me what the par is for your course. Also the bridge across the creek is sagging and looks like a structural nightmare. And now they've added a big plastic slide (that looks like the Porter County Fair threw out because it wasn't up to their standards) that costs $3. I don't know how many trips you get for $3, but I'm guessing it's not $3 worth. Their mediocre pizza is one of their largest selling points if that's any indication of what they have to offer. As far as your point goes, it is very crowded a lot during the summer so I would hardly say it was underrated in any way. Also, fun is subjective, so loud noises, flashing lights, and broken games may be your cup of tea, but next time I'll pass.
