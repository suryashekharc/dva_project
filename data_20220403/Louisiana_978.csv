"I hate Texas, but really it's because of Texans. Really, though, I don't care. I'm certainly not spending my time trying to change the Alamo a different color or something. Why would I do this? To bother Texans? I don't hate Texans or wish them ill-will. I just find them annoying. This is obviously based on generalities, though, as there are so many wonderful Texans out there. Hell, I lived in Austin for almost 5 years. I was the only person, it seemed, who didn't like it, but there were many many wonderful people.

The thing is that the number one reason Texans bother me is how much they think everyone cares about them. The idea of spending my time trying to annoy them would seem to validate their point of view. Does it bother you that Texas is, in fact, bigger than LA as they are so fond of telling everyone? I don't give AF. Why would any adult care how far it is to a state border? Do you care that Texas was independent for a spell almost 200 years ago? I don't. I don't know why I have to hear about it (or why Texans never mention that the state voluntarily gave up this 'independence' to join the US. I guess they're too busy being proud of their 'independence' to lament their 'dependence'.) When Texans come to Louisiana, I don't try to convince them that Louisiana is better because our portions are smaller but tastier. Why would I annoy people like that? It's freaking annoying. Let's go eat and have a good time. I hope this person enjoys themselves, but I'm not gonna tell them that my home is better, bigger, or more interesting than theirs. I believe that LA is better than Texas in the ways that matter to me, but I'm not having an argument or starting one over it. Here are some other weird things Texans are proud of: (1) the Texas state Capitol is higher than the US Capitol and is the only one allowed to be so because Texas was once independent. (This one is false. LA's, for example, is much taller. Still, Texas has a beautiful state Capitol, but you'll NEVER meet a Texan proud of THAT. Size is all that matters to a Texan.) (2) They fly their flag at the same height as the US flag. Good for you. I don't even have a flag pole, let alone two. (3) Beef. They do smoke a good brisket. Many BBQ places insist, unfortunately, in including beef in their sausages. It's an inferior sausage meat. Stick to pork in sausages, y'all. (4) Highways. I don't understand being proud of highways. (5) Texas beaches and mountains. These are fundamentally interior to those in every other beach and mountainous region. Actually, Louisiana beaches are worse. 

When I go to Texas, I see Houston (great food in strip malls surrounded by cookie cutter neighborhood and houses), Dallas (same as Houston but drier and a little hillier and I don't know about the food), Austin (full of yuppies and wonderful swimming holes and no sidewalks and people whose favorite thing to talk about is how great/progressive/weird Austin is when Austin isn't actually any of their things), and endless acres of dead grass between them stretching out forever. There are some small towns in there that I like (e.g. Greune), but I'm mostly glad that the people who live there like it. I only wish they'd shut up about it. 

So, if you like Texas, great. Enjoy. Cool. I don't, but why should it matter? It doesn't. I don't have to live there and I won't. Hopefully, some Texan isn't gonna try to tell me how much bigger or better it is than LA, but I sure that'll happen. If they're really annoying, I guess we won't go hang out and get a drink and eat some tasty food. I hope they're less annoying and we can be buds with their Teaxs-ness just being a minor character flaw.",t2_3qrvzp26,YossarianJr,0,1649009416.0,0,t1_i391ili,i391ili,False,CheniereSwampMonster,t3_tuul8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/tuul8a/help_me_turn_the_alamo_pink_on_rplace/,Help me Turn the Alamo Pink on r/Place,/r/Louisiana/comments/tuul8a/help_me_turn_the_alamo_pink_on_rplace/i391ili/,1,r/Louisiana,0,1

"To combine the posts, because they're all good...

It must be noted that there are distinct flavor regions of Louisiana. New Orleans kind of has its own variations of dishes, so that's why I'm making it distinct. And Southwest as well as North Louisiana are culturally questionable as to whether or not they'll be authentic.

Muffalettas, jambalaya, its offshoot pastalaya, red beans and rice, and beignets, Boudin, cracklins, different types of stew (Backbone stew in Mamou is what made Anthony Bourdain lick the bowl), gumbo, Poboys (The original was the Roast Beef poboy, the most popular is the Fried Shrimp poboy), bread pudding (Especially with rum sauce), king cake (Although you missed the season for it, which is Epiphany through Mardi Gras), pralines

Fast food... I'd also recommend giving Popeyes there a try if you're in a pinch. I moved up to Minnesota and the Popeyes here is N O T the same. The spicy here is the mild there. Also there IS or WAS a Popeyes Buffet in Lafayette, the only one. And then the original Raisin Cane's is in Baton Rouge right off of LSU's campus.

" WWL began broadcasting as a 10-watt station at 833 kHz from the Marquette Hall on the Loyola campus on March 31, 1922. A piano recital was the first program on the air. The first broadcast day also included a three-minute request to listeners to support the construction of a new classroom building on campus. By 1924, WWL had 100 watts of power at 1070 kHz, and a year later the station was at 1090 kHz. The station's frequency went up to 1220 kHz along with the power at 500 watts in 1927. WWL, now at 850 kHz, increased power to 5000 watts on March 31, 1929, following the installation of a new transmitter in Loyola's Bobet Hall. In 1932, the station was at 10,000 watts of power, and in 1937 it reached 50,000 watts. WWL has been an affiliate of the CBS Radio Network on November 1, 1935.

  
In the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, the station was famous for the live broadcasts of local Dixieland jazz bands, including such notables as Papa Celestin, Sharkey Bonano, Irving Fazola, Tony Almarico, and Lizzie Miles. WWL's television partner WWL-TV came on the air on September 7, 1957, and was also affiliated with CBS. WWL's transmitter in Kenner, Louisiana, on the south shore of Lake Pontchartrain, was moved to Estelle, Louisiana, in 1975.

"Uh. The most egregious gerrymandering in the map was done to create a majority-black district. There would likely be no black districts without gerrymandering.

It should favor putting borders on defined incorporated areas and boundaries such as major highways and rivers.

"10 foot delta with 1 foot step size. Starts at 2000 global mean sea level. It’s a primitive model — you will see low elevations inland fill in as their elevation is overcome by the sea level. This is a result of a bathtub model (simply raising the level of the water plane) and my not deleting those parts of the water plane.

Keep in mind, we won’t see a 10ft rise from 2000 levels by 2100 even by generous estimates; however, we may get close (8ft) and sea level rise only accelerates as it gets worse.

"It's usually ""The camp""...but unless you get invited you might have to check places like Bayou Courtableau from Port Barre to Washington or ""The Levees"": (is where this areas ""bayou folk"" reside...) visit the area bar rooms & card games to get a real cultural feel. Arnaudville, Breaux Bridge, Henderson. Cajun/Creole people will talk to just about anyone so the other two questions are kind of redundant. Just ask 3 different coonass the same question and you'll get 3 different life stories and family histories.

Careful, there's LOTS of drinking. Evangline Parish is more woodsy than bayou but plenty of cultural sights between it and Mamou/Eunice areas leading to St Landry parish where it all becomes a mixture of  Cajun/Creole culture with French & Zydeco music in the recipe.

"My neighbor in NOLA, who lived on the block for.... 50 years was getting concerned about all the flooding. 

He said it only ever flooded during big named hurricanes... this flooding on a Tuesday rain storm was unheard of... and every year it was getting more and more frequent. 

Tornadoes also started hitting more and more. Had one jump the house a few years earlier and absolutely DEVISATE a couple houses around us.

The storm line roulette was also exhausting. Especially in 2020 when we had so many.. and those storms were going from 1-4 over night. Ida was a prime example of how that will fuck everyone up... because despite YEARS of hurricanes, the city, state, and country still doesn't have a rapid response evacuation plan in place for contra flow etc.

"A new bill has been introduced into the Louisiana Legislature. The bill is currently written to keep teachers from being able to discuss sexuality in any form, with a student.


This means that if a student wants to come out to the teacher, someone they look up to and respect, the teacher cannot be a support to the student. It is not clear the repercussions that could follow, but this bill is dangerous to children who are at their most vulnerable. As a person who came out at a young age, I turned to two teachers in school, for support and information.  

This bill will try to make its way through the House and Senate, then on to the Governor's desk, where, we hope, he will veto it. We are asking everyone to please reach out to your state representative, urging them to vote this bill down.

"Ok, I’m very close to the situation. While **this is an extreme overreaction from Stilley**, (I’m of the camp that this isn’t a good idea) let me at least provide context and explain why it was made. 

Before I do, let me explain something. Our district is down very bad. We have the worst discipline out of any parish in the state. It’s so bad that we aren’t even allowed to write it up most of the time. This is because the district doesn’t want it on the books because they’re already under a microscope from the desegregation lawsuit. The don’t want the state coming in. 

As a result, kids are running very wild because there’s zero accountability. They know they can get away with anything because only the extremes get in serious trouble. A fight barely results in consequences. They’ll go to in school suspension most likely. If it’s a repeat offender, they’ll get suspended a day or two. Because of this, fights happen all the time. And because of fights happening all the time, they get recorded. And after they’re recorded, kids use it to instigate more fights on social media. 

That’s the main reason why that rule was put in place. 

Again, it’s a stupid rule. An incredibly stupid one. 

Plus, Stilley and the school board are bluffing. Everyone laughed at the email announcing the rule the moment it hit our inboxes. Fights will continue to happen, they’ll continue to be recorded, and nothing will happen to the kids. 

Spring Break is coming up. This “rule” will be tossed out and forgotten once we get back. We have LEAP coming up.

"Monroe is disappointing if you're expecting a big city.  There hasn't been a big act/show through town in almost a decade, with most coming to the local university, ULM. Right around that campus, and Old Town by the river are theost entertaining areas of you're into night life. West Monroe around Trenton St. and Thomas Rd. are also great for dining and thrift shops. There are tons of hidden holes and restaurants around, too. 

There are lots of lakes, rivers and ponds around if you're into the outdoor life. D'Arbonne, Caney, Black Bayou, and the Ouachita River are all within the parish. And if you're willing to drive 1-2 hours at the most, you're going to find state parks and wild life refuges that you can explore. 

Finally, avoid south of I-20 east of Old Town. Even the police and emergency services are hesitant. Since Katrina, the crime/murder rate has skyrocketed. Lately, the Banditos have started to move in and it's only getting worse.

"I moved away from Louisiana in 2018. I am native to Shreveport but frequented Ruston & Monroe during college and basically, I guess the best advice I can give is find professors or other educated people at the colleges in north LA who are working on making things better. A lot of people are only nice because they want to know your business and try to strong arm you into joining their church. Don’t trust anyone until you are SURE they’re not motivated by some mission from God. 

That said, I made some lifelong friends at Enoch’s and the Blue Monkey Tavern back in the day, and if the music scene comes back alive again you’ll get to peek into the best thing about Louisiana: the music, the art, the food, the culture. 

If you want to cut through the tent revival layer and get right to the good parts, just go a little farther south to Lafayette or NOLA. 

The difference in the cultures between north and south Louisiana are so stark, it’s the reason I’m obsessed with studying cultural anthropology and how it relates to social power structures.

"I have land and a house just outside of Monroe. It’s not my permanent address, but I’m in the Monroe area about ten days a month.

It’s nicknamed Funroe, which is literal or sarcastic, depending who you ask. If you like the outdoors, conservative mindsets, and you’re somewhat religious, you’ll like it. If not, Funroe is a pretty miserable city.

If you’ve lived in a small town your whole life, Monroe will be like moving to New York City. If you’re from a decent sized or even large city, it’s definitely going to feel pretty small, not that that’s a bad thing necessarily. The people for the most part are pretty friendly. Some of the nicest people I know are from Northeast Louisiana. It’s also a place where a lot of the people are connected to their old school conservative Christian values and most people attend church. It’s definitely not progressive, like a good majority of the South. The people can definitely be judgmental, as they think their political and religious views are the only correct way of thinking, or you’re wrong and you’re a bad person for thinking otherwise.

There’s a couple of pretty good restaurants in the area I enjoy too. Depending on what you like, you should try Cotton (nicer Southern/Louisiana food), The Fieldhouse (sports bar, usually pretty good chicken wings), and Flying Tiger Brewery. Enoch’s is the best casual bar in the area.

There really isn’t much to do in the city. The Pecanland Mall is one of the peaks of entertainment, and that really isn’t saying much. There are some antique shops along the river in West Monroe that are worth checking out. They sometimes have some cool stuff you can find in there, which I always enjoy looking for cool old stuff to hang on the wall. You have to really enjoy outdoorsy activities, like hunting and fishing, to really relate to a lot of the locals. That’s a huge deal to most people. It’s not big enough for any sizeable events to really take place. You’d have to travel to Shreveport/Bossier City or Little Rock for any somewhat big event coming through the region.

UL Monroe is a decent school, but it’s not that big. Most students probably live within about a 75 mile radius of ULM, and that may even be a stretch. If you care about sports, they’re awful at almost every sport except water skiing. High school football is a big deal to a lot of people there (especially West Monroe), if you like high school sports. That’s usually another one of the highlights of entertainment for the area for the entire year. Again, not much happening.

The crime is pretty bad despite it being a small city. There are definitely areas to avoid. The homicide rate in 2020 was over six times the national average. Even around ULM’s campus isn’t always very safe at night. North Monroe is a nice area, and where there’s less crime and nicer neighborhoods. A lot of locals there with generational wealth, not that they’re billionaires by any means.

I would completely avoid Bastrop at night. In 2020, USA Today ranked Bastrop the 7th worst city to live in, in the entire country. Just avoid Bastrop unless you’re going to Simmons Sporting Goods.

One thing I’ve noticed is that there are a decent amount of people in the area from Arkansas and quite a bit of Razorbacks fans in North Louisiana. I honestly think I see more Razorbacks stuff than LSU gear around the city at times (not like everyone is a Razorbacks fan, but there’s definitely enough for you to notice). I think it’s funny.

If you have questions, feel free to message me. I’ll be happy to give you recommendations.

"Live in west Monroe. Grew up here, left for a while, moved back. It’s a decent place to raise a family. We don’t go to church every Sunday and haven’t burst into flames yet but lots of folks do the church thing. The cities are really putting forth effort into boosting stuff to do. It really depends on what stage of life you are in. Lots of pretty outdoor activities. Paper mill is stupid smelly but it’s so many peoples jobs that what can you do? Water is brown. Get a whole home water filter installed. 

I don’t regret moving back (I did so for an excellent high paying job and help raising my son with family) but my husband on the other hand… eh. The people are nice. You don’t encounter many folks that won’t help you out if you need it. It’s a small town though so people can be cliquey. I don’t intend on being here forever though.

"I grew up here, moved away, and came back to be with family.  The city is just ok, both West Monroe and Monroe.  If you are coming for work, then if the job is good for you to move here then do what is best for you.  The cost of living is pretty low, but there is a good bit of poverty in certain areas.  Depending on where you want to live, you can get a decent house with some land for a decent price.

If you are into the outdoors, then you will like it here.  There is good fishing and hunting in the area.  As mentioned before, the downtown is just ok, both West Monroe and Monroe, but IMO as someone that grew up here, it is improving.  Both mayors are trying to increase the quality of life of residents.

ATT fiber is here if you need high-speed internet without a data cap.  It is in the major neighborhoods closer to the city, other than that we have Comcast cable with gig, but with a data cap.

If you have kids, schools are decent at best.  I have had good luck with WM schools with my kids, but as a whole WM/M I think are average.  We have some private schools in Monroe also.

(Pardon my rant, I just really don't like those old money people.)

Downtown Monroe has some neat shops and restaurants, as does West Monroe's main street. There's an Irish pub, Enoch's, on Louisville that I'd recommend. They have some pretty good live bands playing sometimes. The Pecanland Mall ain't what it used to be, but it's still pretty much the place to go for movies. I'd *highly* recommend Yummy Japan from the food court, it's always fire. There's the Warehouse, on Olive st.; it's a little pricier but has some really good food, I'd recommend going there at least once.

There is gonna be a free event called ""Woofstock"" at Forsythe Park on April 9th, if you have time for it. Last years was pretty good, and this years is supposed to be bigger.

And yeah, people could call a bookie since the 40's.  It's not the same thing.  You have to have an account with the bookie and it's not something you can just do on the spot like the app.  You have to know all of the bets you want to make in advance, you don't just have a list of hundreds of things you can bet on and even some suggestions. You have to do research, and you have to live within driving distance if you ever want to collect your illegal winnings.

Offshore betting runs risks of just not getting paid outbofnyou win more than they want to pay.  What are you going to do, sue them for not giving you your illegal winnings?  And if you do win a lot, it's hard to get without drawing the attention of the government.

I mean, do you work for Ceasar's or something?

"I’m not OP, but I think they were trying to imply this (please correct me if I’m wrong, but be kind!):

Many of the individuals who tend to dislike these topics are the ones who have a particular set of beliefs thag they want taught in their homes and environments. They look at issues like these and call them “sensitive” or simply don’t want them to be taught because it doesn’t allow for their own perspectives to be the ONLY perspectives taught. 

The problem with disallowing diversity of thought comes when the prevailing type of thought or perspective discourages freedom (of speech, of body use, of sexual orientation, etc etc) and also discourages critical thinking (CRT, etc etc) among other things. 

When it is therefore promoted to think in a very rigid, specific way without any encouragement of alternative ways of thinking (critical analysis), it could be said that the lack of education (ie ‘uneducatedness’) is being promoted. 

Simply - if you ask many of the people who will support this, to tell you about the arguments of the other side (like most good debaters can do), they would not be able to in the slightest - they choose to be uneducated about what isn’t inside of their rigid perspective that they’ve been socialized to adhere to.

No it didn't.  I said:

> No good can come from being able to bet anywhere, anytime.

You've had a mobile app that allowed you to bet from anywhere anytime since 2000?  That's pretty impressive considering the first modern cell phone with an app store (iPhone 1) was released in 2007.  I did have a Blackberry with a web browser in 2003 but mobile internet even in a good market with tons of towers (which was not any place in Lousiana) was so slow that if that was the only way to bet it would actually discourage gambling.  

As I said, I'm not op.  I'm not anti-gambling, and I don't think it should be illegal, but I don't think any good can come from being able to place a bet instantly any time someone gets the urge to, or gets some (usually bad) information/advice from a coworker or friend and wants to put the bet in right away before they forget or whatever.  The only thing a cell phone app is good for is impulse betting, which is always bad.

"That gentleman is more or less right but rarely does the process go according to how it’s supposed to. You’ll often find private practice lawyers mishandle the nuances of these cases and filings much less public defender. The courts are equally slow, misfile, or simply forget about certain steps. You need to be vigilant at every step. 

Pleading 894 when you are sentenced does not automatically trigger dismissal, expungement, or reinstatement of your rights. When you have completed the terms of your probation:

1. the judge will need to sign an order indicating that you have satisfactory completed such. Typically this happens automatically but you may need to pursue personally or through an attorney. This is the first step.

2. You will need to take that order and submit a petition personally or through your lawyer. This petition pursuant to 894 is “Motion to Set Aside Conviction and Set Aside Prosecution”. Once signed by the judge you will need an official stamped copy.

3. You will take this Motion to Dismiss to the Office of Motor Vehicles. This document instructs them that you are considered essentially not guilty of the DWI. Your license will be reinstated without penalty or, if you chose to get a hardship license at any point, the violation removed from your record. 

4. You will also take that Motion to Dismiss and need to submit a Motion to Expunge both COURT and ARREST records or it will forever show up for employers even if it is an arrest without conviction. You will need to contact and frequently prod whatever was the arresting agency and provide them with the court orders indicating your case for them to remove any public statements mentioning your name and seal their own records. 

5. If you never got a hardship license and paid for any SR22 then apply for insurance as if nothing ever happened. They will never know and when they check your record it’ll be clean. If you did then the insurance companies know about it. You’ll need to use all your documentation so far along with the clean copy of your driving record from OMV to have them release that. 

It’s not an easy process and a lot of people mix up 894 vs. Pre-Trial Diversion. I’m not aware of a way like the other guy said that you can get your license back without SR22/hardship with 894 UNTIL you have completed all conditions.

"You are absolutely right. Many of the French Creoles (whites of colonial French descent) in Acadiana dropped the creole identity just like the Cajuns did (Cajuns used to be called Acadian Creoles before the term Cajun was invented) and those French Creoles became “Cajuns” too. Many surnames that are considered Cajun today like Rabalais, Fontenot, Lafleur, Soileau, Fuselier, Devillier, Mayeux, Cantrelle, Prudhomme and many more are French Creole surnames and existed in Louisiana before the Acadians arrived and are not Acadian. Also, most people claiming to be Cajuns are not Acadians but are a mixture of things like Acadian, French, Spanish, German and some even English, Irish or Native American. And on top of that, the term Cajun started out as an insult created by anglos to call Acadian Creoles to mean someone that was a poor, backwoods Acadian hick. Just like Indian became injun, Acadian became Cajun. So I can see how this term Cajun can be disliked by several people.

Before the Cajuns were called Cajuns, they were called Creoles just like we were and Acadian Creoles to be exact in the same way we are called French Creoles. The mixed race creoles are callled creoles too but they are known as Creoles of Color, different from French Creoles or Acadian Creoles.

I’m a white creole from the New Orleans area and we white creoles (we like to refer to ourselves as French Creoles even though many of us have Spanish admixture) we have a society where we have meetings, balls and an electorate called “ The Society of the Founders of the City of New Orleans” and we are the people many folks read about that inhabited the New Orleans French Quarter (or as we refer to it, the Vieux Carré) in the 18th and 19th centuries (meaning our ancestors did, but we are that group). We still remained grouped as a society socially even if we are no longer grouped in one neighborhood anymore. We understand that there are white creoles, mixed race creoles and black creoles, but we often think of our type of creole first when speaking of “creoles” which I think other races of creoles do the same. Here is a New Orleans media post about our society in one of our gatherings: https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/society/article_5f9751c1-f0c7-5006-aff5-0e0aacf65c4c.amp.html",t2_acgjmrmi,T_r_a_d_e__K_i_n_g_,0,1648012660.0,0,t1_i1rdv2y,i1rdv2y,False,PnutButterN_Jealous,t3_c26dcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/c26dcg/taking_offense_to_the_term_cajun/,Taking offense to the term Cajun?,/r/Louisiana/comments/c26dcg/taking_offense_to_the_term_cajun/i1rdv2y/,1,r/Louisiana,0,1

"Your definition is spot on. I myself, I’m a white creole from the New Orleans area of French and Spanish ancestry and there are still many whites here that identify as creoles. We even have a societal group that has meetings, balls and an electorate. We are the French Creoles that many read about who inhabited the French Quarter in the 18th and 19th centuries (or as we refer to it as the Vieux Carré). Many people in Louisiana try to racialize creole but documented history proves them wrong every time. I grew up being taught that creoles could be white, mixed race or black in Louisiana and this is backed by documented evidence in our state’s past. We are taught that even Cajuns are creoles and that they were called creoles before they adopted the name Cajun (which they are still creoles despite that name). That’s because we are taught and live by the definition of creole you’ve outlined, which is the correct one. As I’ve explained I’m a white creole, and we white creoles have a society in the New Orleans area that was created as a continuation of our societal councils from the old days. It’s  called “The Society of the Founders of the City of New Orleans”https://www.nola.com/entertainment_life/society/article_5f9751c1-f0c7-5006-aff5-0e0aacf65c4c.amp.html

"There are still plenty of people in Louisiana that don’t like the term Cajun because it used to be an insult used by Anglos to insult Acadian Creoles (Acadian descendants in Louisiana). Just like Indian became Injun, Acadian became Cajun and was used in a way to mean someone that was a backwoods, poor person of Acadian descent. The term was adopted by a handful of people and they tried to flip it and turn it into something positive so in the 1960’s, the Acadiab descendants adopted it and went from being Acadian Creoles or simply just creoles, to being Cajuns.

"I have some suggestions for music festivals, which are really what set us apart from anyone else and are essential parts of our culture. Some festivals require a ticket to get in, but most are in public places and are free to attend. 

If you come to Louisiana in the spring, Festival International is in Lafayette in April and you have to go no matter what. Don’t listen to the other commenter who said it’s not critical,
It is. The Baton Rouge Blues Festival is also in April. 

If you come in the fall, Black Pot Festival & Cookoff and Festival Acadiens et Creoles are in October, also in Lafayette, and also part of the essential Louisiana experience.

There’s not much happening in north Louisiana - it’s more rural and they don’t really go all out for the festivals like south Louisiana does, but if you’re here over Christmas, visit Natchitoches and their Christmas festival on Front Street. You won’t regret it. 

Don’t come between July through the end of September. It’s not worth the heat or the hurricane trauma. If you have to come sometime during that period, *definitely* don’t come between late August - September - that’s when we’ve traditionally gotten the worst storms.

LSU campus, at any time of year, is beautiful. They have their own dairy/ice cream store. Old live oaks and magnolia trees all over campus.

"You can’t compare humans to animals. Humans aren’t like animals. We’re not bottlenose dolphins, or bonobos or any other animal where homosexual behavior has been observed. Even fruit flies partake in “gay” stuff. To compare humans to animals and insects is foolish. Their brains aren’t the same as ours. There’s many guesses as to why this happens in the animal world. Things like practice for heterosexual relationships, social bonding and plain ole good feeling from genital stimulation have been hypothesized. It doesn’t serve any purpose to the species i.e. survival/reproduction of the species. 

I used to raise pigs and I had a pig that used to hump a stump lol!!!! He “loved” (human term) that stump! He would rub his stomach raw from humping the stump. I’ve had same sex dogs that try to screw each other. This only proves that animals are just … animals 🤷🏻‍♂️

Humans are, in comparison to animals, intelligent beings that are unlike any other living thing on the planet. Being gay/bi/trans/fluid, or whatever term you want to use, is definitely not natural. By todays standards, if someone comes out and claims they love stumps, they’d be praised and glorified and a new letter would be added to the LGBTQP spectrum. 

There’s personal benefit to the human gay couple (love/orgasm/financial/shelter etc…) but it does nothing for the survival of the human race. There may be personal benefit to sex change surgery or dressing like the opposite sex but, again, it serves no purpose to the grand scheme of things. Also, the suicide rate is very high in LGBT population.

Animals have no idea what “homosexuality” means. That’s a human term/label. We definitely don’t have animals that think they are the opposite sex. We do see abnormalities like doe’s with antlers, hermaphroditism, and other unnatural occurrences like that, but a “homosexual animal” is not a thing.

"Find a swamp or bayou tour somewhere in the south part of LA. You’ll be able to find a lot of great food down there as well. Ask locals where the best places to get food is where you’re at. Don’t just Google it. Get a few opinions each time if possible. They’ll also be able to tell you where to go pick up fresh seafood, like crawfish and blue crabs, for the best prices if you’d like to cook it yourself. A lot of places will have the option for them to cook it for you also if you don’t want to cook it yourself. 

There are many mom and pop shops all over, they’re worth stoping at and checking out.

I will say to be prepared for some things to be closed, even if they say they’re open online, and have backup plans ready. Covid shut a lot of places down as did the last major hurricane they had.

"You are wrong. The religion of the founding fathers is irrelevant to wether or not we are a Christian nation. We are a nation that exist where no man woman or child can be forced by the public sector (the government) to believe in any deity or religion.

It never was and it never has been the founding fathers actively fought against the inclusion of a favored religion by the government. 

Stop pretending to be persecuted for your religious beliefs it’s genuinely pathetic. You are not being persecuted for having the same religious beliefs as over 50% of Americans. How genuinely vile of you to claim persecution while actively advocating for the suppression and silencing of those with views other than yours. Are your Christian beliefs so weak and delicate that they fall apart at the mention of other ideas is your god so weak he can’t exist if history is taught in a neutral and accurate manor? You are sitting her preaching a moral high ground while while condemning those around you judging them based on their perceived sins, talk about throwing the first stone.

"You are right about being free to choose but you’re off on the part about not being a christian nation. Most of the founding fathers were christian. We know this from things they’ve wrote in the past. They weren’t all deists as some would say. Too many people have given up on faith because they’d rather do do whatever they want without fear of consequence. People have become so self centered today. The christian standard is lost on so many young people because of attractive worldly influence. It’s also lost under the guise of “education.” We took god out of the equation and now, by todays standards, someone like me is “wrong” or “dumb” for believing in God. Specifically the Christian God. Other religions are ok but being a christian is frowned upon. Speaking of being wrong… you’re wrong about people on here giving me something solid to back up their side of the spectrum. It’s all Ad Hom and emotion. Nothing of substance. Some of the comments are deleted now but there’s been some nasty stuff said about me from people that don’t even know me lol!!!

No objective reference point for guidance. It’s all one persons word over another, which is flawed right out the gate and leads to things like we’ve read on this thread. If you have something to say about this thread I’d love to read it. Give me something other than “f**k off,” “you’re an a**hole,” “hypocrite” and “you’re wrong(because I said so).” Give me something good.

You still haven’t given a logical response to anything I’ve said.

Why is it ok for you to have a say on this matter but it’s not ok for people on my side of the fence? Do you think your opinion is the only one that matters?

Houma is interesting but has been wildly Americanized due to its transient population.ic and catahoula. the courier de mardi gras in Vacherie (back of Gheens) and Choupic is unique in the world (no one else shares that practice to my knowledge, more medieval than what eunice and mamou do).

Houma is interesting but has been wildly Americanized due to its transient population. Isle de Jean Charles is an experience but not welcoming to outsiders - and I'm not sure who remains. Chauvin is also a fishing community but took heavy damage - is the statue garden even there?????

Bayou black is also a good one, better on a slower mode of transportation. The mixture of black communities and white is a telling tale and the lower half has a lot of historic bridges and churches. I uses to enjoy biking down to Gibson where the Carol Street bridge was - but not sure if it is even there anymore (google street view says no but maybe it was a redo?).

"DaRoadLessTaken

Some do choose to be that way and some don’t. 

Some people are born with a mind that makes them want to murder. Some peoples minds cause them to find literal humor in bad things. Some people are born with the attraction to children. Some people are born with a mind that makes them want to hoard. Some peoples minds cause them to be obsessive and compulsive. Some people like to eat dirt while some people like to eat even weirder things like glass and batteries and other non-food items. Some people are born with gender dysphoria. Some people have so conscience. Some people have no empathy or sympathy while others have a strong sense of the two. 

We labels for each of these things
-psychopath 
-murderer
-sociopath
-pedophile
-pica eating disorder
-being gay 

Etc… 

I’m honestly not seeing your point here. 

Why are some genetic disorders vilified while some are glorified? 

Surely the pedophile takes the side of other pedophiles. Same goes for hoarders and psychos and on and on. It’s like a brotherhood or bond. The same goes for racial stuff and political parties. 

While things like murderous urges and psychopathic tendencies are much more dangerous than being gay, it doesn’t change the fact that being gay is considered a sin. 

Just because there’s tons of LGBTQP people in the world doesn’t make it less of a sin.",t2_aw6dymy7,Ya-Mamma,0,1647718204.0,0,t1_i1be8wf,i1be8wf,False,KingForHire,t3_tgmcpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Louisiana/comments/tgmcpo/theyre_trying_to_not_do_good_things_for_ourselves/,They're trying to not do good things for ourselves for our schools again,/r/Louisiana/comments/tgmcpo/theyre_trying_to_not_do_good_things_for_ourselves/i1be8wf/,-2,r/Louisiana,0,-2

"Ah, yes. There it is. The ole comment about trying to downplay Christianity and it’s values. Clearly you don’t understand what Christianity is and what it means to be a christian. 

It’s simple. 

We are all sinners. This us that part you referenced with the “purported Christian’s” comment. 

There’s no way around it. We will sin over and over again. Nothing we can do about it. The wage of sin is death! We all deserve to die because we sin. 

To die in your sins means to go to hell because the wage of sin is death! 

There’s a way around it though. If you believe:

-Jesus died for your sins (past, present and future)
-He was buried (proof of death) 
-He rose from the grave (according to scripture)
-He was seen by over 500 brethren (according to scripture)
-He ascended into Heaven 
-We wait for his return 

That’s it! 

It’s called having faith. You can’t see that it happened. You can’t touch it or examine it. You have to have faith in it. It’s that simple. Once you accept it, your life changes.

"I’m not gonna downvote you. It’s ok to disagree. 

You should shut the conversation down and tell them it’s not your place to give advice or to teach on that subject. 

The LGBTQP topic will turn into something along the lines of how it’s ok to be gay or bi or trans, or whatever the mood of the day may be, when the truth is that it’s not ok. Like it or not, we are a christian nation. Christian values teach that being gay is a sin, just like lying, stealing, committing adultery, lusting etc. 

It’s not your place to “teach” a student that LGBT stuff is ok, just like it’s not your place to teach a student it’s ok to lust, murder, lie, commit adultery etc.

I’m not judging anyone by saying this. I’m just pointing out the fact that it’s a sin. It’s one sin out of many. It’s the only sin referred to as an “abomination.” It’s called this because it serves no purpose in regards to procreation and the survival of the human race. Two men cannot make a baby. Two women cannot make a baby. Marriage should be between a woman and a man and those two people should work very hard to stay together. A growing child needs both ends of the spectrum of kale and female. It’s unnatural to be gay/bi/trans/cis and there are many problems involved with that kind of lifestyle. 

I know LGBT people. I Love many LGBT people. I don’t agree with their life choices and that’s ok. Its ok for people to disagree.

"I teach 7th grade and this past week, my students had to read the Preamble to the US Constitution and discuss which rights are guaranteed to citizens by both the Preamble and the Constitution itself.  Students were expected to brainstorm current events/social issues, locate three articles  related to an issue of their choice, and then determine if the current events/social issues they selected either challenged or supported the rights guaranteed by the Preamble and Constitution.

During the brainstorming session, *almost every group of students* included LGBTQ+ rights on their lists **on their own volition**.  A large number of students requested LGBTQ+ rights as the topic they would like to research, and since one of the goals stated by the Preamble is to ""establish justice,"" I allowed them to research the topic of their choice - as was dictated by the state-mandated, heavily-scripted curriculum we use.  (Google ""LearnZillion"" if you'd like to learn more about the ELA curriculum we use in public schools in most of the state.)

"It really isn't that bad. West Monroe is very safe. North Monroe on 165 North is nice, Forsythe Avenue and park Avenue area is very nice and safe.

Stay away from The 165 South,Richwood areas near the zoo. That's where all the crime happens,  but btw the zoo is really nice, not all brand new stuff but it's ran by a guy now thats very active in keeping it up.Also stay away from the area surrounding the  Paper mill  in West monroe going Louisiana 34 South, Thomas road area across the railroad tracks,  it's rough. Depends on if you're trying to buy a house, rent and what your budget is, but you could surely find something decent in the area.

One more thing is we have an ok active nightlife setting if you're younger and a lot of excellent locally owned restaurants that are above average. We're not South LA but we do have a good bit of cajun influence in the area. We are also not the biggest and active cities but certainly not the worst and boring. Good luck!

"You are very welcome u/war_owl - this project sounds really cool!  I’m in north Louisiana, but I’ve lived in the state the last 44 years. I’ve been in industrial sales & distribution my whole career so I’m very familiar with the major industries across the state.  

I almost forgot something huge!  Louisiana is a swamp.  Just about the whole state.  This means we have to be experts in water diversion and flood plains etc (and bridges).  There is a series of dams across the state, I’d recommend checking out the Bonnet Carre spillway west of New Orleans. Flooding is another very common cultural phenomenon we’ve all just accepted.  Some places flood a lot, but it floods in almost every city every year at least once.  Some people in bad areas  keep small boats near their house so they can park above the flood and boat back and forth to their house.  Totally normal during hurricane season.  

I wasn’t joking about bridges.  The top 3 longest bridges in the US are in Louisiana, and most of the top 10.  Any given day I probably drive over a dozen or so bridges.  

Last thing - the Cajun Navy..  That mindset pretty much embodies Louisianans and our culture.  When disasters strike, we go check on our neighbors and the elderly.  And there always home because nobody evacuates for less than a Cat3 hurricane. Like we can’t deal with a little water.
