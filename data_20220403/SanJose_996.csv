"I've worked at MSTA (Milpitas star aquatics) and at a Bay Club for a number of years. I recommend not taking lessons there as staff are hit-or-miss and you can't guarantee that you will get an instructor who is competent in teaching adults how to swim from scratch.

I've observed too many instructors teaching adults the same way they teach children, glossing over many fundamentals because children pick up skills differently than adults. While many principles of swimming mechanics stay the same, practice and technique in swimming is slightly different when it comes to adults. 

Taking adult Novice swim (usually the level before Beginner) classes at a community College is the better option (and you save more money, too. Many independent swim schools will charge way too much for what little instruction you get).

Only go for private lessons after you have had a chance to build up and practice fundamentals.",t2_70edon8h,nooegrets,0,1649004388.0,0,t1_i38p7c9,i38p7c9,False,graveltrack,t3_tup9oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/tup9oc/swimming_lessons_for_adults/,Swimming Lessons for Adults?,/r/SanJose/comments/tup9oc/swimming_lessons_for_adults/i38p7c9/,2,r/SanJose,0,2

"Lean Feast- about $8-10 per meal depending on what type of protein and how much you want. Any of their chicken thighs are bomb 

California Fish Grill- located in South SJ if you are in that area. They specialize in fish, you can choose your healthy sides and it‚Äôs super tasty. About $12-14 per meals.

Sandwiches are always healthy, I would head to Zanotto‚Äôs down in their deli section to order their sandwiches. You grab a piece of their menu and circle what you want, bring up to the counter. $9-11 depending on what you choose. If you want something cheaper, go to any Vietnamese Sandwich store averaging $6-8. 

Vietnamese vegan/vegetarian restaurants usually offer a rice box for about $10. You get to choose the two sides with either rice or noodles. Most of them have brown rice options.

"Hi! 

I've conducted swim lessons for over a decade now. I've had too many lessons to count at this rate. I've also taught and helped adults get over fear of the water dozens of times. Especially adults who can't even take showers or who have extreme fears in general. 

I have connections with multiple swim centers but i believe it may be a long grind and too much distraction. I also help teach people at any location! Which arguably is much better for the adult. 

I teach anything and everything in swimming: competition, survival swimming, triathlons, stroke refinement, special needs, toddlers, water therapy and aerobics, ocean survival (on location), snorkeling. And soon-ish to be certified in scuba training for others. 

Send me a PM if you're interested.

Also is anyone looking for quick tips or advice please feel free to ask me anything, AMA.",t2_f5xps780,JollyFerrell,0,1648995462.0,0,t1_i384m0r,i384m0r,True,graveltrack,t3_tup9oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/tup9oc/swimming_lessons_for_adults/,Swimming Lessons for Adults?,/r/SanJose/comments/tup9oc/swimming_lessons_for_adults/i384m0r/,1,r/SanJose,0,1

"Right, but the original contention was that the L & L combo plate, especially when used in the context of feeding multiple people, wasn‚Äôt or shouldn‚Äôt be considered a ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù option, which is actually absurd.

Starch (rice) + protein (grilled chicken) + vitamin rich plant option (mixed steamed carrots/brocco/zucch etc), the components that can make up the combo plate (subbed out: Mac Salad) are pretty damn good in terms of a healthy option as you‚Äôd get cooking for yourself at home.

As I said before, the sodium content of the chicken is of restaurant level (ie too much) but otherwise that dish is simultaneously nutritious and delicious, and one of the only reasons the combo plate isn‚Äôt terrible great for an individual is the massive amount that is served to you. (Which, in faith with the OP thread, was implied to be split amongst multiple people).

None of the conversation was purely a calorie based discussion, it was looking at the ingredients of the menu items in question. 

So ya, you‚Äôre right, 2000 calories in gummies a day isn‚Äôt going to lead to a nutritious outcome, but the conversation wasn‚Äôt really about calorie/portion control.

"You can eat healthy when going out, you just have to navigate a menu for healthy choices, and don't overload your portion sizes. 

For example, if you're out with a group of friends going to in-and-out, getting a hamburger protein style with no sauce is gonna be a fairly filling, tasty option that is far healthier than getting a double double + fries animal style. 

At a diner, getting an egg+(insert veggies) cheese-less omelette with a side of fruit is a great option regardless of what kind of diner you are at. 

Lettuce based salads often have a lot of hidden sodium added onto the dish, but leafless, no dressing salads can be filled with all sorts of tasty ingredients that proper restaurants will always have on hand. 

Restaurants use the same food as anyone else. And most Bay Area restaurants, both small and chain, are pretty empathetic to people trying to eat out in a healthy manner.

"There is no such thing as eating out 'healthy' unless you're using a meal prep service specifically catered to that. Most restaurants will be cutting corners using the cheapest ingredients possible that they can get away with without you noticing to reduce costs. From the oils to how the meat is handled etc.   


The only way to truly eat 'healthy' is make your own food, with some minor exceptions.   


Now if you're just looking to eat less calories and don't really care about the actual quality of food or how it's prepared, just pick up something simple like a chicken at costco and a bag of greens.

Proposition 13 only allows reassessment of valuation for property tax purposes when property changes hands. Commercial property is rarely sold. It is usually held by a holding company. If the holding company is sold the real estate is still owned by the holding company so it is not considered a real estate transaction so no reassessment of value for property tax purpose.

"Grew up in the Dallas suburbs. Now live in SF and parents live on the Cupertino/SJ border.

I think infill developer has finally started becoming a thing because people have realized they don't want to live 2 hours away from the urban core. 

Also both share in common that they are probably far larger than you think they are. I would never have guessed that SJ is the 10th largest city in the country, and by several metrics the Dallas metro is the 4th/5th largest in the country and is probably the biggest city you would never think to visit (I know I just compared city size to metro size, but the point still stands).",t2_aooh5,albuhhh,0,1648922104.0,0,t1_i34se2u,i34se2u,True,cwx149,t3_tu1hug,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/tu1hug/guess_what/,Guess what?,/r/SanJose/comments/tu1hug/guess_what/i34se2u/,1,r/SanJose,0,1

"BEFORE YOU READ-
I want you to know that it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you keep the SAME PHONE NUMBER WITH SERVICE and WORKING VOICEMAIL from the very start of the process and throughout the entire length of time in which you find yourself in hardship-
in order for ANYTHING TO SUCCEED.

""I want you to listen carefully..""*LIAM NEESON voice*

First things first,
Make a generall health appointment with Valley Homeless Healthcare Plan/Hope Clinic offices to establish primary care in downtown on Santa Clara st ASAP.
There you will be given a housing assessment where you will be asked a number of questions-
When finished you will be placed into a community queue awaiting public housing, permamnent supportive housing or rapid rehousing.
(your spot on the list may be prioritized based on the severity of your answers given, this could mean a difference in years, so it may be best to keep a broader gray area mindset when answering..)

IF you struggle with the disease of any addiction and wish to make a change, recovery can be your key to finding housing.

Call Gateway, get into a remote 3 month outpatient program and the day after your intake let your counselor know about your housing situation and your counselor can make a referral for you to live in a SLE for UP TO 9 MONTHS (maybe 1 yr). Because of covid you basically get a whole house in SJ to yourself, only trade off is staying sober!
Plus, medi-cal pays for it!


Call 211, ask about a referral to the motel voucher program with Lifemoves!

*If a change in your contact info is inevitable, update immediately with the county BUT be weary that any changes could be a death sentence as they do not always get communicated back to the corresponding agencies and programs partnered with the county so try to avoid this at all costs.
Remember that there are thousands of people needing assistance so these places only reach out ONCE rarely twice before moving on to the next person on the list (but they will leave a voice mail). However with Obama phones in existence, there should never be a reason for which you cannot be reachable 24/7/365 or able to return a call wjthin the same day.

**all these suggestions have been tried and true in effectiveness by yours truly, 
After taking the assessment my wait time was about a year until I was picked up by an agency and placed into a great subsidized  apartment (where you pay rent based on income).
If i had known any of this information maybe i wouldn't have wasted time in a van and on the streets for the 2 years prior to someone sharing this knowledge with me. 
Feel free to reach out if you're in need of any more knowledge info or clarification! Always love helping a fellow female out!

Same demographics (if you include the Asian population of OC, that is). Both have about the same blend of post-war suburbia & new urbanism.  Both have large amusement parks. Both are the global hubs of their respective industries that draw creative talent from around the world (tech & film/television) and therefore have about the same relatively high level of sophistication. However, both still share inferiority complexes due to their proximity to their world famous regional centers (SF & LA). SJ has better Asian food and SF Valley has better Mexican food.  But the Asian food in OC kicks ass too, tho.  Also, the South Bay has a legit downtown, while the valley is closer to Malibu than SJ is to Santa Cruz. The valley is bit more edgy, sexy & cooler, but the South Bay is smarter & wealthier.  Both places feel like home to me, tho.

"**[Chiropractic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiropractic)** 
 
 >Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially of the spine. It has esoteric origins and is based on several pseudoscientific ideas. Many chiropractors, especially those in the field's early history, have proposed that mechanical disorders of the joints, especially of the spine, affect general health, and that regular manipulation of the spine (spinal adjustment) improves general health.

"Santa Cruz is a fun day trip, you can get lunch somewhere and take it to the beach to eat. Santana row is fun for shopping and people watching, as well as downtown Los Gatos. The rosewood hotel in Menlo Park used to be great for people watching (especially on Thursday nights AKA cougar night), however I‚Äôm not sure how it‚Äôs changed since Covid. My husband and I like getting massages together, there are a lot of cheap Asian massage places that do the foot reflexology for super inexpensive. Lots of good hiking around here too, download the All Trails app so find one that fits your needs. Communication hill is beautiful for an evening walk before the sunset. Lots of great restaurants all over. My husband and I love Dry Creek Grill, good food and good people watching. There are a lot of good thrift stores around here if you like treasure hunting lol, there is a goodwill boutique in downtown Menlo Park which has higher end things (not as cheap as regular good wills though). You can take a scenic drive up past Los Gatos into big basin. There are several petroglyphs (or places similar) where you can paint pottery, I‚Äôve been wanting to go with my husband. Downtown Willow Glen is cute and good for a little walk, shopping, and lunch. Campbell farmers market on sundays (no dogs allowed tho unfortunately so keep that in mind). Mo‚Äôs in downtown Campbell has a great brunch menu (they usually have a pretty long wait though), their bloody Mary‚Äôs are good. I‚Äôve been dying to go to Filoli garden, I believe it‚Äôs in woodside (or close to it). Valley Fair is great for high end shopping (although they have all stores you can think of), and a lot of good photo ops (they have these big rainbow arch things that you can take pics under). Vasona park in Los Gatos is super pretty, great for a picnic and to see all the ducks. Rose garden is nice, as well as the Japanese garden. Great America is close by. The great mall is okay, a lot of the stores are outlets so super cheap. Lots of movie theaters all over (there is a newish one in valley fair). The prune yard has some good restaurants, orchard city kitchen is my favorite. Museums downtown. These are just the things that immediately come to mind, I think people often don‚Äôt think about how much there is to do around here!

"San Jose's issue is the juxtaposition of its sleepy suburban bedroom community to its more eclectic and culturally diverse brother to the north, that being the city of Frisco (or San Fran).

Lately, the biggest data point people are using to differentiate a city is home prices. The city in which you want to live in but can't afford to do so automatically sucks. The corollary is that the first city you're able to afford a house in becomes the best city in the country.

Edit: In the morning, drive from Santa Cruz to San Francisco. A little known, but super solid breakfast/brunch is the Davenport Roadhouse. Be sure and make a qucik detour across the street to the beach. Then proceed north to half moon bay, have lunch at the many popular seafood resurants, walk off you food coma in the quaint downtown area. Continue north to SF, stop for a early afternoon drink in the Haight. If thats not your style, hit Golden Gate Park for the De Young Museum, California Academy of Science and a ferris wheel.

"I do want to add however that it certainly isn't worth paying to repair the cheapest vehicle you can buy nor is it worth it to pay to get it out of impound(which is why I lost 4 vehicles to SF, which says alot about the penalties levied when it's cheaper just to buy a new vehicle than to attempt to pay such fees).

But it very much would be in anyones interest whos thinking of living out of a vehicle to go down to the library, get a card if they don't already because being homeless without a library card is just foolish. And use their resources to find free access to the service or shop manual for your vehicle and be prepared to just try to address problems with your vehicle. If you own a vehicle, it's yours after all, and being then also your home just like a home made of timber it's in your interest to know how to maintain and repair your home.

I went from only enough knowledge to be able to change the oil on my car to being someone who changed a cv axle on the side of the road or overhaul the valve body on an automatic transmission in a more conducive situation.

"Oh god I'm doing better, thank you. Being homeless though really opened my eyes to how we treat the homeless and why things appear the way they do. For example, I was lucky enough to go into homeless already dedicated to sobriety but because of the considerable and constant stress and mental/emotional toll your constantly suffering while in such a state I don't ever fault or look down on any homeless person who self medicates just to have any kind of relief or escape, even if momentarily and even if counter to one's self interest in the long term. People just don't understand and certainly don't want to understand and it's usually so transparently represented when they say overly simplistic things like  ""just get a job"" ""make better life choices"" or claim the problem is drugs and mental illness as if those things by themself cause homelessness and aren't a symptom produced by the stress of being in that position. 

Nobody seems willing to even consider things as simple as bad luck or that there are bad people who take advantage and put people in such a position in life through greed or the simple fact that saying your going to help and allocating money to ""help"" isn't actually help unless you're willing to actually give something to people who have nothing. Not even enough to help themselves if they wanted to.

It's sad that in the greatest and richest society in known human history we have absolutely no floor, no bottom, no basic guarantees of eachothers well being. We're so cut throat and obsessed with capitalist competition that we're seemingly ok with individuals holding so much wealth as to be measured as a whole number percentage of all of our societies wealth while also being ok with vast numbers of other people literally having beyond nothing and even being ok with punishing those people for having nothing and pretending we live in a just society.

You measure how just a society is by how a society treats the worst off in those societies.

"Oh trust me, as someone who lost 4 separate vehicles I lived out of to the city and county of San Francisco in the year and a half I was homeless, I'm well aware of the difficulties and hurdles in the logistics involved in getting those belongings as well as the hoops your forced to jump through at the impound lot in order to make that happen.

I'm just simply pointing out that saying you lose all your possessions the moment your car is towed isn't true. I'm not saying it's easy or that you have another place to then put those possessions, I'm just saying you still have access and months to figure something out. I mean really NOTHING is easy and many things made impossible because of homelessness.

I'd also say that you should basically assume that at some point your vehicle will be impounded. It's just going to happen especially considering so many parking laws and vehicle laws are actually specifically designed to punish people who try to live out of a vehicle and there are far too many regular ""concerned citizens"" who go out of their way and make it their personal mission to make sure the homeless suffer those penalties in the interest of chasing them away from their proximity.

I'd also caution on assuming anything is safe in a locked vehicle and that it's absolutely in your interest to establish a safe to keep certain things that aren't so vulnerable.

Because let me tell you, it's hell when you have your window smashed and all the things you absolutely need taken from you. I can now personally advise anyone on what to do when you've had all your identifying documents(ID, birth certificate, any and all paperwork with your name on it) stolen from you and the only options available to even start then all rolling on proving who you are. One thing I'll say is everyone and I mean everyone reading what I just wrote and has any concern it could possibly happen to them, which there's almost always the possibility of, would be wise to take pictures of all identifying documents, especially ones with your picture and to keep digital copies on a free cloud service like Google drive.

"While homeless I was denied CalFresh(food stamps) twice. I got denied both times by people who are paid a comfortable government salary to comb through my information looking for any minor thing they could deny me on. One of the times I was denied because during the required phone interview I made the mistake of admitting that I sometimes cook meals with my girlfriend. That was all they needed to hear. The person who gave the interview makes a living wage in one of the most expensive areas to live to talk to a homeless person to find a reason to deny them getting help to purchase them just food.

If you ever wonder where all this money goes that we ""spend on the homeless"" the answer is right there. We don't spend it on the homeless. We spend it on the salaries of the people required to means test and gatekeep whatever is left over after paying those bureaucrats to help people who are put through a lot just to get basic help that people who have never gone through the process seem to think we just hand to all the people sleeping on pavement.

We don't spend money to help the homeless.

"Was homeless for two years:

My advice is your focus will be on mobility and mobile appliances.

Hygiene:

Shower for cheap at a YMCA gym. Plus is you get to work out and participate in other activities.

Smelling good and appearing good does wonders for your own personal morale and societal success

Restroom:

The Pandemic has made it extremely hard to use what you once considered a basic human necessity. Toilets are going to be a new resource you did not consider.

Find yourself a good area that is somewhat secure while also having good toilet access. Gas stations, stores/restaurants, Gyms, or any public venue. The healthier you eat, the less you need to rely on using restrooms much.

Diet:

BY FAR MOST IMPORTANT is your diet. I totally neglected this and ate fast food with a mix of Poke salads every now and again.

I gained weight slowly despite working out and developed a Fatty Liver Disease.

Eat well, eat organic and eat salads if need be. Avocado smoothies are awesome too. All you need to eat healthy is something like a mediterranean diet. Research up and figure out how to store it.

Type of Vehicle:

Since you‚Äôre getting a van, you can probably store more and make more with what you got.

I had small cars, the more space definitely helps in the long run. However your van won‚Äôt be as easy to blend into neighborhoods. Blending it helps keep the eyes away.

Additionally Vans=Merchandise. Make sure to make yourself not a target of bandits and opportunists.

Keeping the eyes away does wonders for your own sanity (no police, no thugs, no curious neighbors)
Keeping a low profile will increase your odds of surviving carhood.

Mentality:

At this point you‚Äôre at war with your societal situation. In order to survive and make it through you have to take it a day at a time and think from objectives.

Read self help books, improve your finances, improve your mentality. Life will throw curveballs your way. You need to be ready for your van breaking down with a reliable mechanic on hand.

Reddit is a wonderful place, you can find information others struggled to achieve with ease.

Fuel:

Get fuel from Costco. It‚Äôs cheaper and much more affordable than mainstream gas stations. It wasn‚Äôt so important then, but this will be one of your major expenses considering the price hikes from the Russian Import Ban.",t2_6gy23nzc,WesternConstruction8,0,1648836695.0,0,t1_i30hi3v,i30hi3v,True,tearsofagirl,t3_tt7mbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/tt7mbw/tips_for_soon_to_be_homeless/,Tips for soon to be homeless?,/r/SanJose/comments/tt7mbw/tips_for_soon_to_be_homeless/i30hi3v/,2,r/SanJose,0,2

"Like I don't know you sure. But the spirit of what you're trying to say? What is that spirit? I don't know anything about you but I can read words so let's run down what you suggest.

1. Don't become homeless 
2. Ask for help
3. Living in a vehicle is better than not
4. Again, ask for that help
5. You can work somewhere else
6. Get out as in leave
7. Homelessness is bad

Did I miss anything? So what would you say out of these points you made really captures the spirit of your message? And are any of these point actually helpful and not mere common sense if not outright condescending with the only real outside the box suggestion literally being you telling them to go somewhere else?

"Fair enough I don't know you or you intent. But your comment, as a recently former homeless person, I find unhelpful and condescending. That's my opinion and you can disagree all you want. I feel ignoring my points though is sticking your head in the sand as far as messaging goes and ignores the very real situation homeless presents.

I don't know your intention, you are right about that and I apologize for making assumptions. It's just that I've heard your suggestion to go elsewhere from a lot of people when I was homeless and I did very much know their intentions and it certainly wasn't given with the intention of helping.

But since you want to help where would you suggest they go? How should they get there without any money or resources? How should they bring their possessions? And what should they do when they get there to help their situation that they couldn't do without having to got through the ordeal of moving?

Telling someone to go somewhere else and just stopping there without explaining just how that's even possible is very much, I find, unhelpful.",t2_1mm0x,Cmonkey67,0,1648834518.0,0,t1_i30c2ca,i30c2ca,False,tearsofagirl,t3_tt7mbw,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanJose/comments/tt7mbw/tips_for_soon_to_be_homeless/,Tips for soon to be homeless?,/r/SanJose/comments/tt7mbw/tips_for_soon_to_be_homeless/i30c2ca/,2,r/SanJose,0,2
