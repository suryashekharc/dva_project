"Oysters grow here- there's a mushroom farm in Hamakua, they may do tours too. They also grow a lot of king.  I googled it and apparently a company does lion's mane but I haven't noticed them at stores. Unsure on chestnut- there's one that looks similar at store- but it may be a beech? Aren't the reishi and chaga just medicinally used?

A good gift are the wild ones that can't grow here- morels, porcini, chanterelle, chicken of the woods. It depends on who your hosts are though.

"It all depends on your budget. There is Chef Brian Hirata of Naau Hilo. He is a recent James‚Äôs Beard semi finalist  for emerging chef. It‚Äôs around $230 per person. He really focuses on ingredients found in the Islands and gets the vast majority of his ingredients on the island. Follow on Instagram @naauhilo and their website naauhilo.com has their upcoming schedule. 

There are a few others on the West side (Kona/Waikoloa) but I haven‚Äôt tried their food.  So I can‚Äôt recommend them. My biggest suggestion is to go on Instagram and start following a few of those people than it would lead to others. Feel free to ask me any questions and I‚Äôll give you my honest unbiased opinion.

"IMO, the Big Island isn't really a ""travelers"" destination. Visitors come, do whatever it is they do, then they go home. Visitors are also overwhelmingly from the mainland United States so long or extended vacations are not really the norm. It's also expensive so those who are able to travel extensively are going to skip Hawaii for less expensive regions/destinations. 

For instance, it's not like what you'd find on the gringo trail in Central and South America or the backpacker scene in SEA, where people have more time and it's easy to take a bus or a cheap flight to the next destination. Travelers in those scenarios also tend to be more gregarious and open to meeting travel buddies. Visitors to Hawaii are rarely travelers in the sense you're referring to and mostly keep to themselves. 

Pre-pandemic I'd occasionally meet people who were traveling from Oceania to North America with a stopover in Hawaii or those who included Hawaii as part of a larger trip to other Pacific islands but that's about it. 

Lastly, much of Hawaii has been static for the last two years. A lot of focus has been on ""getting back to normal"" but it feels like that mentality has been mostly geared toward tourists.

"Slow Your Roll is cool and has good vibes, but it's got a monthly/per visit membership fee. They were also charging people to attend D&D sessions in their new room (which, admittedly, is pretty cool). They're a game lounge and not a game store like Armchair Adventurer or Other Realms. So unless you and your players want to pay, you may need to find another space.

I don't know if Game Escape charges for use but they have a bit more space and tables. They're definitely more of a collectible card game type shop.

"Parasites that spread through being eaten have evolved to withstand stomach acids, it‚Äôs usually via microscopic cysts that are kind of like eggs. 

Most parasites that infect a saltwater fish won‚Äôt survive long in a human even if you do eat some cysts and they manage to ‚Äúhatch‚Äù inside you.

But the risk is not zero, though the same can be said of eating any fresh non cooked, non frozen foods.

She was playing. He was not. 

She did not request what happened to her. 

That's the part you completely made up and I have no idea where you're pulling that from. 

It's nice to insert your own speculation into things, but the anecdotes in that article are pretty clear.

Literally both anecdotes say Ezra was out of control and went way too far, and neither imply he was playing into anything. 

 It says nothing about the girl ""requesting"" to be choked and slammed to the ground. Only that she was joking play fighting, as you can see in the vid. 

In fact the 2nd one sounds even worse, it says he even started spitting at other people including the bartender and the girl's (that he choked) brother.

"Allegedly the girl in the video requested he do that. I remember when this happened. That‚Äôs why it never got him fired from DC, because there were no charges filed and the woman in the video is not actually hurt. It seems that she saw him, decided she wanted to ‚Äúfight‚Äù jokingly, and he played into it. I think both of them regret that incident because the OP for the video took it down and Ezra refused to talk about it.
I don‚Äôt support this kind of interaction, because she could‚Äôve been hurt, but it seems this particular  incident may not have been outright aggression like the stuff he‚Äôs doing now.

"We've hosted students the last three years, from Indonesia, Germany, and Latvia, via the International Hospitality Center, which handles a mixture of different source programs. The short version, from my perspective: the students are great, the programs are not well-supported, host families are super hit and miss (often miss!), and our schools are always a bit of a letdown.

If you can offer a stable family environment that's often a huge step up in terms of providing a positive student experience.

"If you are going with Mauna Kea Summit Adventures you are in good hands.

"Aloha /u/UncleCatDad, and anybody else interested in what to do with visitor questions.

>  I remember there was a weekly or monthly thread for these posts. 

Indeed, you remember correctly. I decided to stop doing this for a while (the last post was for [December 2021](https://www.reddit.com/r/BigIsland/comments/r73enf/please_submit_all_tourism_related_questions_here/) because the volume of these type of questions decreased significantly (hello, omicron), and the ones that we do get are either not answered (if they are made in the correct place), or get answered before I get to move them. I also started getting the impression that the questions asked in the monthly visitor question thread were far less likely to receive interaction than questions posted directly to the subreddit. 

Seeing this topic pop up, and judging from the comments, I am happy to restart the visitor topic again. I think it will be more efficient (mostly less time consuming for me) if I would change the following things compared to the previous series. 

* Make it a yearly topic (comments/questions sorted by ""new"") .
* I completely understand wanting to share your knowledge with visitors, a BIG thanks to all of you who are doing so! Last time around I made sure to copy those responses with username mention when I would move the question. This time around I may skip that sometimes.
* I will delete any comment that is not directly helpful w.r.t the question asked.

"Aloha /u/Sonoranpawn. I like your suggestion to set up a subreddit community wiki page! I think that is a great idea that could be of benefit. 

 I can see how community input would be best to gather suggestions to add to different sections of the wiki page. Definitely worth considering!

I understand your overall frustrations. And yeah, looking for information online can answer a lot of the basic questions. As can searching the sidebar for previously asked questions.

"Aloha /u/UncleCatDad, and aloha to everyone else here participating in the post thread! 

I appreciate you expressing your concerns, and please know that we‚Äôll enter into moderator discussions about bringing back the monthly visitor questions and answers stickied post. 

Anytime anyone has a suggestion or concern, please feel free to send us a modmail. That‚Äôs one of the quickest ways for us to address suggestions, ideas, and concerns. 

[Here‚Äôs a direct link.](https://old.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/BigIsland)

As volunteer mods, we genuinely listen to what you all think is best for the subreddit community. We‚Äôre always welcome to hearing how we could strive to do better, or ideas about improvements we can make here. We‚Äôre here to be of assistance to you all!

I too have noticed a recent uptick in visitor questions. We initially removed the monthly visitor mod post due to Governor Ige asking that tourists reconsider visiting Hawai ªi nei during the peak of the Covid outbreak happening. 

But seeing as though things are leveling out, and that most Covid restrictions are being dropped this weekend; it makes sense to bring it back again as we‚Äôll almost certainly see a high level of tourists and visitors this summer and beyond. 

The /r/BigIsland community has always been so kind and helpful when visitor questions are asked. And for that a huge mahalos! 

We don‚Äôt necessarily want to discourage visitors from asking questions, but absolutely understand the regular participants here not wanting to see this community flooded with those types of inquiries. We seek to find a balance between the two, and the monthly visitor post thread is a good way to achieve that. 

Also, as a side note, if you ever see anything that breaks the subreddit community guidelines and rules ~ or the rules of Reddit ~ please report it. 

Feel free to leave any other subreddit suggestions in the comments here too!

Myself and /u/Lovebigisland will talk story about this, and hopefully have things worked out by next week. Mahalo for your patience and understanding. And mahalo nui everyone for making this subreddit community the incredible place it is!

"A few days ago someone posted asking for affordable restaurant recommendations and got a lot of good replies. Born and raised here, when friends visit we usually hang out at the beach, pack a cooler with poke and beer and head to Kua Bay (as soon as the gate opens), or Hapuna (can be windy), or Makalawena if they want to hike or we want to 4-wheel drive it. 

The faster drive to Volcano is at least 2.5 hours from Kona, you should be dressed for a rainy hike, and the lava glow‚Äôs only visible at night, but it‚Äôs worth it if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre into. The slower route to Hilo (on the coast) has some cool places to stop and eat. You could stop in Honoka‚Äôa and get Malasadas, and I think Umauma Falls (waterfalls and cool tropical foliage) is worth a pit stop. 

Another thing that‚Äôs free, but you have to check that it‚Äôs open while you‚Äôre here, is to go to the Mauna Kea summit at night for stargazing. It‚Äôs cold and high-altitude btw.
