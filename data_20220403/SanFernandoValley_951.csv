"people treat bigger cars as if they have the turn radius and dynamics of a smaller car. As someone who drove a mini van as his first car like 5 years; when you go from that, to a car it literally feels like a toy. You can make sharper turns without feeling like you're going to fly out the door at faster speeds while in a truck you might have to slow down significantly before turning on a ramp for example.

The other thing I've noticed is people going over lanes consistently, since smaller cars fit with an abundance of space even some minivans from the early 2000s had space but cars are getting wider especially crossovers and suvs. But people are not realizing that their car is bigger which changes how you should drive it.

"Panera Bread in Encino has a million little tucked away table areas inside to grab a bite, pastry, coffee or drink to zone in on a laptop or with a book! It's also really quiet, give or take a rando kid here and there. Love this one!

Coffee Bean on Ventura & Louise has space & u can tuck off in the corner by the door on Ventura or along the windows of Louise. Either way, it's where I go to do work with earbuds in as the blender can get loud.

"> I want to see their selection as well.

I'm nearest the one in Woodland Hills, but have visited 2 of the others a few times. Selection varies a little bit by location, but seems to be pretty consistent.

In my anecdotal experience, the selection is largely comparable to what you'd find at a Ralphs/Vons/Pavilions, with a light smattering of ""365 Branded"" items from the Whole Foods stores.

There's a ""pretty good"" selection of pre-made foods on a day to day basis, but while none of it has been ""bad"", I find that a lot of it tastes very processed/""factory made"", which is probably to be expected.

Prices are about average, but can run a *little* high on some items; sales help but aren't amazing. I still buy most of my grocery stuff elsewhere since a lot of it is cheaper at other stores.

If I'm being honest, I haven't found much of anything to compel me to shop there regularly. The one ""big advantage"" is that most or all of them act as drop-zones for Amazon shipments, so you can both pickup and return items through them.

"Does anyone out there have any insight as to what's actually going to happen with this property?

The linked article makes mention of the pre-existing plan: ""URW recently completed the city’s planning and development process for the property, securing approval for a dynamic 3.2 million square foot mixed-use development aligned with the area’s existing Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan.""

The ""Promenade 2035"" pitch has been *years* in the making. Westfield started trying to get the ball rolling as far back as the mid-90s and the plan has evolved numerous times, partly to include the renovation/expansion at Topanga and the construction of The Village.

The Promenade lot is (was?) supposed to be the 3rd piece in the puzzle, and the property was ""supposed to be"" rebuilt to include shopping, hotel, and business space, and an amphitheater. [They've even got a website about it](https://promenade2035.com/).

All the sudden like 3 weeks ago I started reading rumors that the site might get used for a Rams training facility, and now this article says the lot was sold.

"this hits home. Last week near Orange Coast College, 2 guys drove into an apartment complex and stole 2 catalytic converters; one of them was mine. While in the middle of sawing off a 3rd, the security guard caught them, wrote down their license plate, and pulled the 2 CCs out of their trunk.

Luckily, I got mine back, and it was welded back on (plus oxygen sensor repaired) for $250. The part itself was $1800 new, so I was super lucky to get it back- papa bless the guard. 

There was a witness who said they took it off literally 5 minutes before I started my car. These guys do this shit fast. For the record, the 3rd car and my car are both Accords, which are among the most stolen cars due to their ubiquity.

"The time frame suggestion is great advice.  I'd go one step further and ask them to write in phased completion dates with escalating penalties for missing those dates.  I'd tell the contractor he can insert whatever dates he likes, so that he can pad them to his comfort level.  Provisions for delays due to no fault of the contractor, e.g. the countertops you chose, the order of which was placed in a reasonable time frame, and yet are back ordered and won't be in for 3 weeks, can be written into the contract and excused with proper documentation.

Contractors who can't, or won't do this, are not confident in their ability to deliver and you probably don't want to use them in the first place.

Edit: Note I would not use this provision as an opportunity to get a discount on construction.   I'd typically only use it for gross negligence.  It's just a tool you have to enforce a contract should things go sideways.

"They are Cree, if that is what you are wondering about. Super helpful too. Love this place. Really great selection of gems and one of the best organized collections of any gemstore I’ve been too. Random detail, but if you go you will see. Not a large store but I can easily spend over an hour in there (I also go mostly for the gems).

EDIT: Have not been here since before the pandemic. Out of curiosity due to the above comment, I checked out their Yelp reviews. Holy shit. As someone with a severely compromised immune system due to a serious illness, I am deeply disappointed at what’s been going on their during the pandemic (falsified room reporting to allow their in store customer max to be 3 times what it should be, no masks, super rude treatment of regular customers asking normal COVID-related questions - all of this during the peak of the LA surge too). This actually changes my view on the shop entirely. A shop that sells items that assist a person’s spirituality would be one of the last places I would expect to completely disregard the physical health of their customers. But it’s the owners and employees responses when customers voiced concerns that did it for me. Shows their true energy all along. They put profit over honesty, health, and the customers that trusted them for years. And all of their products just soaking up that negative energy…

"Cost Plus!! They have a really nice selection from different parts of the world (besides the usual regions found in nicer supermarkets). Usually have specials on certain types of wine or regions. And I’m pretty sure if you become a rewards member (free), you either get a discount everytime or get points towards future discounts. Since they have wine from places that are not as famous for being wine regions, it tends to be less expensive for better quality (than a discounted bottle from a well-known wine region, for example). Also super fun to experiment since so many labels you can only find there (out of the main supermarkets).",t2_4v2kdjtm,BodhiTree1133,0,1646389781.0,0,t1_hzauqke,hzauqke,True,itsokay0,t3_stjrcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFV/comments/stjrcr/affordable_wine/,Affordable Wine,/r/SFV/comments/stjrcr/affordable_wine/hzauqke/,1,r/SFV,0,1
"Old Topanga Canyon. Starting past Mulholland (towards PCH). Never any traffic, lots of scenery changes along the route, places to pull off in the mountains. Just feel like you are worlds away from LA, even more so than on “regular” Topanga Cyn. Some of the drive is up high with mountain views, but then you go through this awesome little “forest.” Trees are big enough to canopy over the road for long continuous stretches. There’s a creek running alongside the road. And then this amazing boulder…massive monolithic feeling boulder right next to the road. Hard to describe, but you will know what I mean when you see it. It seems out of place right there next to the road (it looks like the ones you see on top of mountains from a distance). 

Old Topanga merges with “new” Topanga at the shopping center/restaurant area. But just before there is one of my favorite restaurants, Inn of the Seventh Ray. Food is amazing, but the outdoor seating is why I go. All different levels, above the creek, mostly shaded with huge trees. Fabulous book/gem/meditation supply store at the restaurant too. 

Anyway, you meet PCH south of Malibu, almost at the Palisades, if you were looking to stay south of Malibu. Hope wherever you end up (or ended up, seeing as you posted 2 weeks ago), you had some fun and got some cool footage.

"Born (late 80s) and raised near Valley Circle/Roscoe. My entire side of our cul-de-sac has someone in their household with a serious illness that has been linked to the site. I’ve had thyroid cancer in my 20s, and I know several other people that live in our neighborhood that have also had thyroid cancer. A neighbor a few streets over said they started investigating things when multiple neighbors ran into each other at Children’s Hospital where they were all taking their young children for treatment for some super rare cancer. That’s around the time the whistleblower came out in the 90s about the meltdown, and shooting the radioactive barrels as “clean-up,” etc. 

I think after the 90s things were not AS bad, but that’s super relative, considering there was one of the largest nuclear meltdowns there. NBC did a pretty great investigative piece on SSFL years back. It’s a good rabbit hole to go down if you are ready to move lol.

"In West Hills a few weeks ago, a guy stole a motorcycle and crashed going almost 140 down Roscoe (crashed at Fallbrook intersection). Instantly died. He was being “followed” but not “pursued” by LAPD air support, which prompted a whole discussion on Citizen as to why etc. 

Apparently, if LAPD feel the threat to public safety during a chase exceeds the benefit of catching whoever they are chasing, they have to back off. There are certain criteria too that mean they won’t engage in a vehicle pursuit - for example someone on motorcycle. Probably for the very reason exemplified a few weeks ago (motorcycles can more easily reach high speeds in the city, can go places cars can’t and where pedestrians are, etc). And I think even the helicopter is technically just “observing” rather than aggressively pursuing. But if you have seen the footage leading up/from that accident (POV from heli), the motorcyclist does not seem to know any of that. At one point he looks up at the helicopter (right around Valley Circle/Roscoe), clearly panics and accelerates from around 60 to over 130 before he passes Orchutt Ranch. 

Anyway, wonder if the had to back off the pursuit you are talking about for such a reason (threat to public safety). Although I imagine not apprehending criminals is an equally if not greater threat to public safety…Still, after learning all that the other day, made me understand why pursuits just randomly end sometimes.",t2_4v2kdjtm,BodhiTree1133,0,1646384046.0,0,t1_hzanuu2,hzanuu2,False,lurker_bee,t3_t5ubnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFV/comments/t5ubnv/man_shot_to_death_another_pistolwhipped_in_encino/,"Man shot to death, another pistol-whipped in Encino home invasion robbery",/r/SFV/comments/t5ubnv/man_shot_to_death_another_pistolwhipped_in_encino/hzanuu2/,1,r/SFV,0,1

"If you’re into scheduling call ahead, we will call early in the afternoon and specify a time for pickup. Works like a charm. Also a big enhancement for any take away pizza is to buy yourself a pizza cutter, they’re cheap, and always ask the pizza place for NO CUT. You cut it yourself once it gets to you.

">How do you mean non stop? 

There are flights from LAX to Phoenix, and then Phoenix to Flagstaff. By the time you factor in the drive to the airport, arriving 2 hours early, the flights, and the layover, you're probably about the pushing the same amount of time as driving. I have no idea about rental cars in Flagstaff, but I know it will be way cheaper to drive. 

As per the weather, yes, Flagstaff and the south rim of the Grand Canyon are high elevations, subject to snow and ice. Nighttime temperatures are well below freezing this time of year, so bring jackets.

"Yes. I have driven across the country, specifically going through Colorado, Arizona, Nevada, California... many, many times. You are gonna be on I-40 forever, which for me was absolutely boring, like driving straight forever. Being you arent going from LA to Nebraska or LA to Florida(yikes, that one is literally driving on I-40 for eternity), it won't be too boring because you'll reach Grand Canyon pretty quickly....you'll just have like 4 hours or so of driving a boring route. I have really bad elevation sickness, I can't remember exactly which part of Arizona it happens...it was something like 7,000 feet. I stopped at an Indian reservation gift shop, nearly about to pass out and nauseous. The shop manager was laughing and said I look better than most people who stop there when they get sick, then explained the best way to fight it was to get out of the elevation, which was 300 more miles for the next significant drop. He gave me some protection tooth(maybe he made it up to make me feel like I could continue). Anywho, nauseous, panting, I high tailed it out, driving 100 miles an hour. I started to feel better and made it. I used to be fine driving this route, but my body has changed over the decades of driving it. Meanwhile, take some stops along the way. My issue was I would literally drive straight and only stop at gas stations when needed.  If you've got some little ones or want a little more for thr memory books stop at old, damn near ghost town Oatman, AZ. It's cool to see this old town.

I think it takes 7.5 hours to make the drive with the minimum number of stops.

"Fill up first when you leave, then fill up again after you cross the Arizona/California border.

Gas is way cheaper in Arizona than in California. Gas prices in Needles, CA will be pushing $6 a gallon, but the third off-ramp 10 miles past the Arizona/California border has major gas stations (travel centers) priced around $3.50 a gallon. 

Then, on your way back, fill up at the same cheap station before crossing back into California, and laugh at the insanely overpriced gas as you drive through Needles. 

The 40 freeway is a desolate stretch, and the gas stations in Needles seem to rely on people panicking and filling up, then they see how much cheaper gas is in Arizona. Don't panic when you see gas prices in Needles. Just keep going into Arizona, then gas up.

"This goes against what you are asking, and I hate when people do that, but I frequented Club Underground at the Grand Star in Little Tokyo for a few years before Covid. Great club, nice but tight venue, perfect DJ'ing. It's one of this things that I've really missed since Covid. Not goth, but plenty of darkwave.

Attached is an article about the Monte Cristo club in Koreatown. It closed down in 2017, but I was a bouncer there in 2000 when the SATOR night was just getting going. This is the goth club that you would be seeking out today.

Now, again, this doesn't directly answer your question, but I've been in the Valley my whole life, have been going to 80s clubs SINCE the 80s, and I haven't heard about much going on in the valley. But in the article that I linked, there should be enough names in there for you to google and see where they are operating now.",t2_j28tt,reubal,0,1645371484.0,0,t1_hxpok4d,hxpok4d,True,uhcanihavearefill,t3_sx2pt2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFV/comments/sx2pt2/goth80sdarkwave_nights_at_bars/,Goth/80s/Darkwave Nights at Bars,/r/SFV/comments/sx2pt2/goth80sdarkwave_nights_at_bars/hxpok4d/,8,r/SFV,0,8
