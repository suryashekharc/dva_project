-volunteer... Animal rescue orgs, charity events, seek out an org  to do this with. Earth day is coming up... go clean up garbage. You could even help people learn English via the Catholic charities. And people who aren't from the US can be the greatest of friends. 

-Go donate platelets on a frequent basis. At the very least you'll get to know the nurses. You may meet more people. 

-Go join special interest groups that you want to get into. Yoga, fencing, gardening, birdwatching (Audubon society)

-Go to a church EVENT. You don't need to join a church to go to some of the events they put on. Many of them have board game nights or meals and such.

"Baton Rouge is slow as shit. I was born and raised in New Orleans and moved to the Capital City after Katrina. It took me a while to give a damn about BR, but after venturing out, I grew to love it.

It’s a slower-paced mid-sized college city (LSU, Southern and BRCC—which is *LSU lite*). There are some race issues that are a bit visceral ever since Alton Sterling, but nothing that would make anyone clutch their pearls all that much. There are SO many amazing places to eat, hanging out at the river downtown becomes addictive, and the theater scene is *en pointe* for a city that size. I can’t forget Live After 5, the free seasonal concert series on Fridays, family-friendly with great bands and food galore.

Baton Rouge is a place where you’ll have affluence and ‘hood jumbled up, so there aren’t many distinct “good” and “bad” neighborhoods—everything is so diverse. But the most desirable areas are south of LSU and especially south of Interstate 12 (I-12). The Garden District and most of Mid-City also round out the more upbeat and historic parts of town, and I’ve always been a fan of Broadmoor.

I’m from a major city only 90 miles away, and it was a culture shock. You’re from the metropolis so it may *definitely* be a change of pace almost like slamming on brakes. But I deeply encourage you to get out and explore, and if that’s not enough, New Orleans is only an hour away.

You will have to have a car, though, and prepare for lengthy commutes because while things aren’t particularly far, traffic in Baton Rouge gets really bad—worse than some of the largest cities—because of poor infrastructure and the refusal of locals to sacrifice land for a loop, a toll road and a third bridge. Their NIMBY-ism is why New Orleans and Baton Rouge aren’t a super-region, so *TRY AS BEST AS POSSIBLE TO LIVE WHERE YOU’LL WORK.* The schools are also mediocre.

So in a nutshell, Baton Rouge is a great place to be if you’re doing well. There are about as many highs as there are lows, but the highs make the lows bearable to a certain point. I’m in Houston now (basically Baton Rouge on steroids), so you’ll definitely be ready to move on at some point. You might not be there a long time, but I think you’ll have a good time.",t2_k378p5r5,5th_attempt,0,1648745691.0,0,t1_i2vae0f,i2vae0f,True,qetuopiyrw123564,t3_tsfosz,https://www.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/tsfosz/moving_to_baton_rouge_soon/,Moving to Baton Rouge soon…,/r/batonrouge/comments/tsfosz/moving_to_baton_rouge_soon/i2vae0f/,2,r/batonrouge,0,2

"On the other hand, I was called for jury duty recently.  Case was murder.  During selection, the 12 person panel I was on was asked if anyone had ever been the victim of a crime, of if their family members had ever been a victim of a crime.  Of course we all had.  

What was shocking: A lady's FIL was murdered recently.  Trial was ongoing across the hall.  Another woman's brother was imprisoned for murder 1.  Another guy was the principal in a murder 1 investigation.   There were 3 more people who were the victims of gun crime.  This is the original panel of twelve, no substitutions yet.

My wife was robbed at gunpoint 15 years ago in broad daylight, my father in law was robbed and held hostage in his own home by 3 armed gunman 3 years ago.  Both in good neighborhoods.

"You’re damn right it’s offensive! It should be! The EBR Public School System is a pox on this city, and every school board member and administrator should be ashamed of how they are objectively failing their community. I’m shocked and appalled every day I go into work and try to teach kids who are constantly threatened with violence by the same kids that the schools repeatedly do nothing about. I meet 16 year old 8th graders who can’t read, kids who fear going to the restroom because they’ll get jumped, kids who literally just leave class and roam the halls without consequence, smart kids who quickly become disillusioned because they’re bullied for giving even the slightest of effort, and administrators who care only about math scores on standardized tests. I do what I can, but the state of these schools is insulting, and every single parent and taxpayer should be out with torches and pitchforks demanding change.

Finally, a transplant who knows nothing about the city or state is asking for advice. Of course I’m going to paint in broad strokes. A transplant doesn’t need to be confused by nuance when they don’t even know the basic info. If OP wants nuance, I’ll explain nuance in detail in a DM, which is what I said I’d do in my first comment.

"I am originally from Baton Rouge, but mostly grew up in Houston. I moved back here for college about 12 years ago. 
The way I describe Baton Rouge is that’s it’s the biggest small town I’ve ever lived in. It’s a great place to make connections and grow a network of friends or business contacts. 
In the last 10 years or so downtown, mid-city, and a few areas in between have been renovated with new life and have brought a ton of great restaurants and places to hang out. Almost every weekend of the year there is something going on and the city comes alive when it is LSU football season. You’ll find that being a college town definitely has its perks. 
Someone above mentioned renting an apartment for a few months before you decided on what neighborhood you’d like to settle into, and there are plenty of good options near the hospitals. 
The culture of Southeast Louisiana doesn’t compare to anything else I’ve ever experienced and I count that as a huge positive. 
People do love to complain about the traffic as if it were their pastime, but growing up in much larger, more congested places, I honestly don’t think it’s that bad. Baton Rouge was never planned to be a big bustling city and is essentially a conglomerate of neighborhoods with an interstate down the middle. 
If you have a chance before you’re due to move, I highly recommend coming down for a weekend. That way you can get a feel for the city layout and checkout apartment locations before committing.

"I like living in the hipper areas -- Garden District, Mid-City, and  Spanishtown have been my favorites, in that order. I'd say Garden District > Mid-City if you like being around trees and slightly more nature (it's close to the LSU lakes, which is a nice area you can jog or ride a bike around + dog park) and Mid-City > Garden District if restaurants and alcohol is more of your scene. But they're only about a 5-10 minute drive from one another, so it's not super far.

As for things to do, there are occasionally some festivals and parades. Blues fest, Spanish Town Parade, and St. Patty's Days parade are all fun. There is also some live music and shows at the place downtown whose name I'm blanking on right now. 

Also a kickball league and two volleyball places. And trivia pretty much every day of the week, at different places.

"I’ll say this…if you’re a liberal, you’ll prefer the older neighborhoods like Spanish Town, Beauregard Town, Garden District, Ogden Park, Capital Heights and other neighborhoods along the Government Street corridor (which has turned into a restaurant row, of sorts).   These are the more walkable/bikeable parts of town, if that’s your thing. 

If you’re a conservative, you’ll prefer the suburbs like Zachary, Central, and the southeast part of town, soon to be “St George”…maybe…with the exception of Gardere, which is black and Latino

Moderates are kinda spread out- Southdowns, Old Goodwood, Kenilworth, Broadmoor, Tara, Westminster…all fine neighborhoods. 

(Of course, this is all very general. )

The city grew out, not up, so anything built after the 50s was very poorly planned and has a lot of traffic. Check a map.  Places without grid-style streets have worse traffic….and are probably more prone to flooding. Developers built newer houses in flood plains…on slabs. Go figure.

"Hi! I work in healthcare in BR and also am a transplant from up north. I've lived here for seven years. Here's what I think:

\- Areas like Mid City and Downtown are going to be where you want to be if you want to live near fun local events and amenities. However, your tradeoff is going to be foot traffic and the inability to leave anything valuable on your porch. I live downtown and there is a high rate of crimes of opportunity. Lock your car and don't leave out any valuables though, and you should be fine.

\- I agree with knittinkitten65. One of the most toxic things is people who are hell-bent on hating Baton Rouge. There's plenty to do if you take the time to look. Check out community calendars in 225 Magazine, get involved in a professional group, look at events on EventBrite (that's how i found out about the Flower Festival this weekend), and more. An ounce of effort will get you far.

\- Food and beverage scene is pretty great here. Check out restaurants along Government st. and Perkins Road.

I love the green, I love the food, I love the culture of parades, I love how everything is fun. old people party hard here and it’s relaxed in that aspect. There’s awesome libraries that have plenty of clubs and socia events to meet people and they are well funded.

There’s lot of history! The museums are cool and some are a 30 min drive. 

The traffic sucks though, going to run errands used to be easy in my small town but now it’s a half hour drive to the closest target.

"Fellow transplant here (primarily Massachusetts). Baton Rouge has plenty of challenges, but it also has things to enjoy if you're willing to give it a chance.

 In the almost 7 years I've been here one of the things I still find the most unappealing about it is the toxic ""everything about Baton Rouge is terrible"" attitude that so many people have. It's hard to find friends when most people either grew up their whole lives here and already have such well established social groups that are very hard to break into or they're just whiney miserable people who don't ever want to see the good in anything or do anything fun. 

But aside from that, I love the food here, Louisiana culture is unique, everything is usually more affordable than the northeast, Mardi Gras is fun, and I'll never have to shovel snow again. 

Not sure what your situation is exactly, but I would recommend renting an apartment for a bit before buying a house so that you can get used to the city for yourself. As you'll see in this subreddit, people have a lot of very different opinions about areas of Baton Rouge, so you really have to see it and explore it for yourself to get a feel for where you would like to live. The traffic in Baton Rouge is strange, so even just figuring out where you commonly drive to for random things can be an important factor in deciding if you want to live in a certain location here long term or if it will drive you crazy. 

I moved here for a job at Our Lady of the Lake, then worked for their health system for a few years before switching to Ochsner. I lived in an apartment complex on Corporate Blvd near Town Center until I bought my house in Mid City (which I absolutely love).

"It really depends on your price point.  Central is a nice suburban area that isn't too far from the city.  It's also on the north side, which gets you away from the bulk of the traffic, but also the nicer entertainment area in south BR.  St. George is another nice area on the south side of BR, but there are more apartments and townhouses.  The traffic tends to be worse there and the crime seems to be increasing in the area with more apartment complexes popping up.  Don't even think about the west side of the river unless you like sitting on a bridge for 1 hour each way.  To the east is Denham Springs, which is a kind of rural city with more rednecks and less drive-bys.  There are some areas in the city that are making a comeback, but you're never more than 5 blocks away from a crime area.

"The school cops I dunno, but I will almost guarantee you, like cops at Walmart, or working a funeral they are working for the commercial entity in a quasi official capacity. It's how most ""underpaid"" cops in Louisiana manage to pull down 6 figures and get free ""courtesy"" apartments etc.

It's graft IMHO, but the cop unions own the city in case you hadn't realized. Kill someone with a badge get the death penalty. Get killed by someone with a badge, they get a free paid vacation for a year or more then almost always back on the force, no loss of rank or promotion.

Some will say that's only if you are black, but it isn't true. Seriously, in Louisiana unless you are rich you think really hard before involving a cop.. especially in Baton Rouge.

"I met him once on a train going to Newark airport. Dude is an asshole. Every since then, I can't stand his comedy.

So me and my buddy were taking a train from NYC to Newark cause our airplane departed from Newark. On the way there, Tim Dillon comes into our car to the airport in one of the stops to the airport. We're clearly tourists or traveling at the least because we have our luggage on us. We didn't ask him for an autograph or anything cause I always feel weird about asking famous people for them out in public if I didn't already pay for their time. So anyways, on the stop before the airport me and my buddy leave the car thinking that that's the stop and he doesn't tell us it's the wrong one. The guy on the next car over hollers at us letting us know it's the next stop not this one. We look back at our car to see that Tim had settled his big fat lazy ass on the seat where we were and couldn't be bothered. If he wanted the seat so bad, he could've 1) asked for it - or 2) waited for us to leave and then sat down but at least told us we were getting off too early.

"I agree with this, but in spite of OP's bias against Albertson's, I have found that with the Albertson's app and paying attention to the sales, I regularly find chicken breasts at the Albertson's meat counter as low as $1.67/lb, though recently it's been $1.85/lb when it goes on sale. They're BIG, double breasts (meaning you'll have to separate the two breasts) and they have a 10lb limit.

"I know this is a long answer to a simple question, but I felt compelled to share some examples of why Baton Rouge's infrastructure is broken and needs more than another lane or two to fix it.

\--

interstate infrastructure in BTR can be boiled down into the amount of traffic lanes that flow through the city. While there are plenty of exits on & off the interstate, the breakdown is traffic cannot flow through the city during peak hours.

When you add up all the interstate lanes flowing through the city, excluding exit lanes and off ramps, you find the following totals:

&#x200B;

* **12 Lanes** \- Adding both east and west bound lanes on both I-10 & I-12 leading up to the merge of the two interstates.
* **9 Lanes** \- After the two interstates merge it goes down to 9 at the I-10/12 split. (4 Lanes Eastbound / 5 Lanes Westbound)
* **7 Lanes** \- It further goes down at the College Dr. exit
* **6 Lanes** \- Reducing down again at the Acadian Thruway exit
* **4 Lanes** \- Before the bridge at the I-10 / I-110 split
* **3 Lanes** \- Just before the merger of I-10E into I-110E you lose one of the two travel lanes, forcing half of I-10E's traffic to have to merge into downtown's I-110 travel lanes.",t2_hrstm,Ruebilax,0,1648263974.0,0,t1_i25flj1,i25flj1,True,peckrnutt3u,t3_to0nj4,https://www.reddit.com/r/batonrouge/comments/to0nj4/is_this_a_normal_friday/,Is this a normal friday?,/r/batonrouge/comments/to0nj4/is_this_a_normal_friday/i25flj1/,6,r/batonrouge,0,6
