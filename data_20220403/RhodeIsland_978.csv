"It's like a bandaid on a bullet wound. This is maddening, and sad. I have firsthand experience with the services this state offers the suicidal person. And those services are either massively underfunded, corrupt, profit driven, or dismissive of the patients. Or, in the case of Jane Brown psych ward and CCA's acute crisis unit, all four!

To actual suicidal people who want something resembling help, I have some practical advice with none of the fluff: your best bet is to check yourself in directly to Butler, if you can. Don't let an ambulance or the cops come, they'll just take you wherever is closest with a bed available. Sometimes this means jail, too. Or a group home. Or a crappy place. I've been almost everywhere in northern RI, Fatima, Landmark, RIH, CCA, BHLink. Butler is your best bet for inpatient hospitalizations.

If you have no health insurance, go to Thundermist and their social workers will get you free health insurance thru state programs if you make under the poverty level. If you make above the poverty level AND your job doesn't offer health insurance, premiums and other costs are based on a sliding scale determined by your income. 

Thundermist itself is not a hospital, but if you only need basic therapy and psychiatry services they will care for you even if you cannot pay.

Try everything before you try the last option. If you're already dead set on doing it, might as well stick around a few extra days to see if you missed out on another possibility. I stuck around and there WERE other options I didn't even know about. You just gotta look.

These barriers on the bridge are symbolic of the true barriers a suicidal person faces in this state. One should not have to scour the Internet for other hurting people's voices, or try every program and medication, or be locked behind a paywall to access help. Suicidal people deserve better than empty gestures like this.",t2_2nfs6jxx,scoutydouty,0,1649012364.0,0,t1_i398k1m,i398k1m,True,MavDrake,t3_tv8nbs,https://www.reddit.com/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tv8nbs/suicide_barriers_on_ris_biggest_bridges_will_save/,Suicide barriers on RI's biggest bridges will save lives activists say,/r/RhodeIsland/comments/tv8nbs/suicide_barriers_on_ris_biggest_bridges_will_save/i398k1m/,1,r/RhodeIsland,0,1

"Suicide barriers on bridges have been a thing for decades. It’s a minimal cost compared to actual systemic corrections - which I’m guessing you oppose as well.

But if you can’t think of the human first, come at this from a cold financial perspective. Each time there’s a possible jumper from, say, the Newport bridge, police and fire resources from Newport, Portsmouth, Bristol, Jamestown, North Kingstown, and sometimes as far off as Warwick are immediately sent in motion towards the bridge for a possible search. It happens often. Broken down car on bridge with no note? We roll emergency responders because minutes matter. 

I don’t know if someone maintains the actual number of responses to the bridges we roll in a year but that would be interesting.

"I don’t see why not, court records are public. 

He sent me a list of deductions that was obviously sketchy. Then he sent me pictures showing damages that clearly didn’t match the costs he quoted. 

The tactics I saw were:

1. Not consenting to mediation by the court. 

2. Not bringing their insurance documents to court. I had to expose that myself.

3. Changing the money amount of their claims live in the court room (submitting wrong numbers and unused defenses in their Answer document). 

4. Telling me the judge wouldn’t listen to me or look at my evidence. WRONG. The hearing was over 2 hours long and he looked at everything and took his time. 

5. Lying. Fully just making stuff up, provably so. Their story changed several times during the hearing. 

6. Objecting to whatever I said. Don’t be scared though, the judge will let you speak when it’s your turn. Don’t be scared to do it without a lawyer, but having a lawyer would be helpful. Do not take legal advice from opposing party. 

Attorney fee clause was in the lease, but I have a feeling that their tactics were not looked upon too kindly. Attorney fees (which probably would’ve been made up and in the thousands of dollars, since his attorney was a friend of his wife, who was also an attorney) were denied.

People chase down guns thinking it'll make them safer, when the reality is that they are just running from the very real issues that drive gun violence.

"We take our two cats to Armory in Providence. One of them has been a patient since 2018 and they have always been great with him. When we have had more urgent needs for him (not emergency, but sudden onset of unusual behavior) we have rarely waited more than one day for an appointment.

We took our other cat in for the first time in mid-March and we let the vet know she is pretty skittish. They took their time and were very calm with her before actually starting the check-up.

The vets have also been super good in answering all of our questions during and outside of appointments.

"Property manager and real estate agent here. The law and local housing code supersede your lease agreement. If they are ever in conflict with one another, the law prevails. 

The state does set minimum habitability standards, but there are layers of county and municipal regulations in play as well. With that said, to my knowledge, housing code with regard to screens and window coverings varies by city/town, how many units are in the building, whether the unit has alternative means of ventilation (central air conditioning, for example), and the type of occupancy you are entering into (rooming houses have different standards than regular apartments, which are different from short term rentals, hotels, student housing, etc). 

If you link to your info source I may be able to offer more guidance. Your best bet is to contact your municipal enforcement body and ask — Google can be confusing and misleading on this topic because there are so many variables at play that most people aren’t aware of. 

If you’re dealing with a small-time landlord, assume they don’t know what they’re talking about and may be completely unaware they’re in violation of the law. I’m not saying that they are in violation in this scenario, but if they are, they may not know that they are. That’s their fault, not yours, but sometimes it’s necessary for the tenant to literally educate the landlord. It’s shitty but it’s true. 

As a final note, to echo others, document, document, document. Everything goes in writing. No phone calls. Save your texts and emails. Screens and blinds are cheap enough, and most tenants expect them, so it could be a sign of trouble that they refuse to provide them for a new tenant, even if they’re not technically obligated to. But it’s a tough rental market out there and I understand sometimes you just really need a place.

"I would respond from two angles:

1. Those new housing units are all in the Sun Belt, which is great! I'm very happy that [Texas and Arizona and Florida and so on are building a lot of housing](https://www.fixr.com/blog/2018/02/06/visualizing-which-states-are-building-the-most-homes/). But they don't do a ton for us here in Rhode Island. Plus, people are moving to those places in droves, so do we actually know that those are enough units for the number of people who want to live there? It matters a lot where the housing is.
2. In a deep philosophical sense it *doesn't matter* if it ""seems adequate"" to you. Nobody knows how many housing units is the correct amount. Nobody knows how many of *anything* is the correct amount. That's why we have markets. The only way to know how much of something should be produced is to let people buy and sell that thing in a market. If you made it legal to build more housing tomorrow, then a ton of new housing would be produced and purchased. That tells us that the amount we're building isn't adequate!

..?  Even in the second most densely populated state in the US, land supply is not even remotely close to being a meaningful constraint on housing availability. 

>Long-term, definitely a good idea, but in the short term (and for those without the money to buy a house), I still think my ideas would have more benefit on the average tenant.

Like most things in life, what’s good for the short term is rarely good for the long term.  Short term rent control is great for tenants.  Long term it disincentivizes investment in new housing and maintenance of existing housing stock. 

Short term promising public employee unions generous pension benefits lets you keep salary costs and thus taxes relatively low, long term you end up with pension liabilities so large that today’s tax rates have to pay salaries today and commitments made 20 years ago by people who only worried about the short term benefit.

This just isn’t how it works.  The ceiling on the price I can charge for rent has nothing to do with anything except the market price for comparable units.  You can’t even really price in the risk that the Federal government will decide to undertake a massive transfer of wealth from landlords to renters again like you can price in the risk that a tenant will destroy an apartment.

"They actually own somewhere between 0.06 and 0.1% of all single-family homes in the United States.

Here are the numbers:

> The U.S. has roughly 140 million housing units, a broad category that includes mansions, tiny townhouses, and apartments of all sizes. Of those 140 million units, about 80 million are stand-alone single-family homes. Of those 80 million, about 15 million are rental properties. Of those 15 million single-family rentals, institutional investors own about 300,000; most of the rest are owned by individual landlords. Of that 300,000, BlackRock—largely through its investment in the real-estate rental company Invitation Homes—owns about 80,000. (To clear up a common confusion: The investment firm Blackstone established Invitation Homes, in which BlackRock, a separate investment firm, is now an investor. Don’t yell at me; I didn’t name them.)

Well just imagine you and I are at a yard sale and we both see a trinket we like.

But if somebody walks up and hands us each another $20, then the maximum price we can bid the trinket up to is $40.

*That's* inflation.

Easy access to the East Bay bike path (I miss that!); Colt State Park.  The Second Story theater is good.  The town, though, is a little congested.  It was a good place to start.  

Good memories of the town on a snowy Christmas eve back in the day.  Fresh snow; about 4"".  Went for a walk around town square where all the churches are.  Got to listen to all the carillons ringing out muted carols as I worked around the square.  Quite charming!

* You have such a complete and total lack of understanding of the marketplace you’re talking about that your opinions on it are worth literal zero.

"These folks think there *is* a simple solution. The problem for them is that their solutions are usually either unconstitutional or unpopular or discredited -- sometimes the trifecta! -- but they do think it's simple -- rent control, property expropriation, onerous taxes on rental properties, and so on. You just take the properties from the landlords and set new rents. Easy.

"Open your eyes man. Black rock alone owns more than 60 billion dollars in real estate in the u.s. and they aren't the biggest. Institutional investment firms now own over half the homes in the country. That is outrageous, and on top of that they are intentionally paying above market value for them which makes it extremely difficult for regular people to buy homes and leads to more and more people being forced to rent.

Also besides not stopping the investment firms from doing what they're doing you can blame governments (local, state, and federal) for making it so difficult to build new homes because of regulations, zoning, and ordinances.

>Max rent should be set at a percentage of the building's value

With values skyrocketing, that clause wouldn't help much. Besides, maintenance costs aren't really tied to property value very closely. My house doubled in value, but it still costs the same to live here. My mortgage is fixed, so the market value doesn't affect me.
