I also like local history very much possibly too much and I think that because the building was built in 1942 they should preserve it and put a shop in it. The reason I think it is an awful idea is purely because of opinion based only on what I feel is interesting which in this case is history it is based no facts whatsoever so I will admit you are probably correct but I will not change my opinion due to stubbornness and over appreciation of local history.

"if the town wants less traffic then they should stop building car centric infrastructure and offer more alternate forms of transportation and infrastructure that supports other forms of transportation. They’ve been pretty good about it the past few years, building more bike lanes, building the rail trail, advocating for further support to the T, widening and adding more sidewalks, and changing zoning laws to have less parking spots per unit.

"I know two students who graduated from Natick - one has a career at Supercuts as a male hairdresser, another goes to UMASS. Contrast that to my class from Brookline - with my class mates who have graduated being CEO, CTO, gotten into MIT and Harvard, BU, BC, written journalism articles for newspapers, worked for Google, etc.. (though some became total downbeats too).. Seems like the kids are mild and friendly in Natick with a little bit of civilized partying, but let's just say it does not seem like many of them are getting into Ivy Leagues or becoming CEOs or doctors..so my point is your kids are not at risk of becoming gangster or drug dealers (like say in Watertown), but they won't be especially well prepared for college education either. I think school system reflects the people who live in the town - neither tough on education nor financially privileged nor members of the upper class with equivalent accessible amenities.

"I also work at Mathworks and came right out of college. When I started here, I lived in Brighton and it worked very well, although the commute is definitely more than 30 minutes each way on average (I kept a log for a year or so) if you are driving. The reverse commute might improve things a little, but there is still a lot of traffic. There are a lot of people new to Mathworks who live near there, basically for the reasons everyone in this thread has outlined.


I think Brighton is a good choice, but there are a couple other things that you might want to consider. 


First is public transit. There is a bus from MathWorks that runs to either the commuter rail or the D line branch of the Green Line. The D line is very slow, but does open up the possibility of living in Brookline (but I like the nightlife better in Allston). The commuter rail takes longer than driving, but is a much more pleasant experience (when it isn't having problems). There are commuter rail stops at Boston Landing (which is an area not very well served by other public transit) and near Fenway park, which is a nice area for some kinds of nightlife but pretty expensive. Commuting by car really sucks, especially from many parts of Brighton since the fastest/cheapest way (depending on where you are coming from) is generally to take Rt.9, which is probably my least favorite road in the world.


The other potential factor to consider is where your friends will live. I assume that you are joining EDG. EDG has a lot of people around your age in it, and people tend to make friends with each other (or at least it did when I was in it; I wouldn't be surprised if the remote situation has changed this to some extent). This is especially the case because many of the people are new to the area and don't know anyone else. Most of the people in EDG live in Natick or Framingham (although it isn't uncommon to be in Brighton or Cambridge, and living in the city might even be more common now that people aren't going to the office). While Natick may not have bars/concerts/interesting restaurants, it is probably where most of the house parties (and other general social events) you will be invited to are if most of your friends are people you met at work. This is one of the main reasons that I moved to Natick.",t2_79u8e,slashBored,0,1641924122.0,0,t1_hs8i69f,hs8i69f,True,graywolf724,t3_s0u1b1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Natick/comments/s0u1b1/21_yo_looking_to_work_in_natick_recommended/,21 y/o looking to work in Natick - Recommended places to live,/r/Natick/comments/s0u1b1/21_yo_looking_to_work_in_natick_recommended/hs8i69f/,1,r/Natick,0,1
"Second the suggestions for Brighton/Allston. I was a bit older when I moved here for my job with them, I commuted from Jamaica Plain for a few years. Was a reasonable drive and also good commuter rail options. There are a fair number of public transit options (busses and rail) that will get you to the campus.

"I grew up in Wayland and now live in Natick. Wayland was a very safe town and great schools. I still stay in touch with people I went to school with. Things are definitely more spread out and more rural as you move north through town, and you definitely need a car. They tried to create more of a commercial area in town center in the past 5-10 years (restaurants, services, etc.) but I wouldn't say its been super successful.

I considered moving back to Wayland but ultimately opted for Natick due to cheaper homes (although that doesn't really seem to be the case any more), but there is a substantial difference in taxes. Wayland doesn't have separate residential/commercial tax rates. Natick Center is much stronger than Wayland's, and for someone who lives walking distance, I frequent the center for a variety of services.

Sudbury I also looked at when home buying, but similar case to Wayland: very rural and spread out, high taxes, great schools.

"From a [similar thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Natick/comments/f0h9lw/rex_beverage_co/).

> Rex Beverage Co was at the intersection of route 9 and route 27 near where the U-haul is today. It shared a building with the Sunnyside Hotel (hotel on top floor, beverage co on bottom floor) until the 1930s. The building was diamantled to make room for the route 9 entrance and exit ramps. It was owned by a John Coleman and a ""Mr. French"".

Some more history [here](https://amp.brownwoodtx.com/amp/41286826007).

I do some bottle collecting myself. Small companies' bottles will be ""rarer"" and sometimes have more value because of that. On the other hand, they aren't as sought after as something like old Cokes because nobody knows they exist. I wouldn't see it going for anything more than $10 or $15.

"Good point. The only other thing we were thinking is that, if we confine ourselves to search for houses that are both walking distance *to* the town center *and* *not* so close as to be within noise pollution range (so maybe \~10 min walk to the town center would be the sweet spot),  we would really be limiting our scope in a market that is already inventory-starved. So then we thought, we should be open to houses that are a short *drive* to a walkable town center. And from that lens, parts of south Wayland can be under a 10 minute drive to the Natick town center, which might only be a couple minutes longer drive than parts of Natick.

"I may be a bit late to post, but Natick is a pretty good place to live in. Natick is a pretty safe town to live in and walk around, you won't be mugged there regardless of the time of day. There isn't much nightlife, but you can take the commuter rail from Natick Center or West Natick to go into Boston so you really aren't missing out much on the city life and socializing if that's what you want. The train runs pretty frequently, every two hours from the early morning to around midnight-ish. The train ride is about 30-40 minute-ish. I don't think Natick is that bad of a place to live for being single in late 20s in my opinion.

There's also the Natick Mall which is the largest mall in Massachusetts and New England. There's an arcade in the mall. There's a movie theater on the Natick/Framingham border. For grocery shopping, I like Trader Joe's and Wegman's. There's a bunch of parks around the lake to exercise and walk around. Also, Natick is easier to drive in than let's say Cambridge.

Cambridge is in the Greater Boston area where there is a lot more going on, but has some of the most expensive rent prices in MA. I personally wouldn't recommend Cambridge because of most of the rent prices.

If you really want to live around the Greater Boston area, I'd recommend living in Medford or Somerville, if you can, especially near Davis Square where you can take the red line subway which connects to other train lines to all over the place. The parks are nice. There's also a bunch of undergrad and grad Tufts University college students around Medford and Somerville. A lot of people like to bike ride in Somerville. Driving, of course, is more hectic and congested the closer you get to Boston.

"Natick Green, Natick Village, and Deerfield Forest are good places to start and within your budget. The property management offices should be able to let you know of any rentals available (many are owner occupied condos while a good number get rented out). Your wife's commute to Worcester should be about 30 min generally opposite of traffic. Your commute to Newton should be similar but with heavy traffic mornings and evenings. Those condos I mentioned are walking distance from the commuter rail which is different from the T and very handy. It goes to Worcester and Newton so if your school or her job are walking distance from those stops that will be killer.

"What others already said, Cambridge, Allston, Watertown and other close to Boston (more urban places) where I'd want to live if I was still in 20s. But with your work in Marlborough that's 1hr commute one way at peak times and much more expensive rent.

I'd look at place in Marlborough or nearby, it will be cheaper/nicer. Going to Boston on weekend from Marlborough or Natick not that much time difference. Weekend traffic is not as bad, on weekend 1hr from Marlborough vs 30min from Natick won't matter much.
For 20s can't think of much Natick/Framingham can offer over Marlborough area, same boring suburbs.

Another option not mentioned here is Worcester, it's in the other direction from Marlborough. It's cheaper, has plenty of bars and is sort of urban, same commuter line to Boston, close to Marlborough. It's not an ""affluent"" city, so may want to research it, if it's to your liking.

"Not sure about buying a car in the area to be honest, but if you need a repair Frank's Auto Repair on South Ave is good.  

I lived in Natick for years, but now am in Watertown which is closer to Boston and Cambridge.  Natick doesn't have a good grocery store right in the center of town, but there are Roche Brothers grocery stores in either direction east or west, and a couple of Whole Foods too.  There's the MBTA commuter rail to go from Worcester to Boston in the center of town, but not sure about like buses.  And there are a couple of bars, but not much right in Natick; more restaurants and overall fancy places in Wellesley, which is the next town over but also more expensive.  

For nightlife stuff, there will be much more in Cambridge, and some more in Waltham, compared to Natick.  But the trade off is commute to Marlborough, which is more west of those, and price since Cambridge can be expensive.  To some extent you'll find more fun stuff to do near Cambridge/Boston, but then tack on like 20 more minutes to your drive both ways maybe along with a higher price per square foot.

"driving from Boston to Marlborough takes one hour. try living in Hudson - it is small and quiet and close, but has a cute town center, though not too many young people, but still a cute place.

natick has quite a few young professional looking people walking to the train station. but place is kind of dead after dark.

cambridge is popping, but expensive and almost overcrowded.

framingham is kind of a weird Brazilian mafia town with traffic.

waltham is more fun than Hudson, and has some professionals and restaurants.

cambridge is gay, cliquey and over stimulating, i think Waltham is best for you.

"Welcome! I have no idea what rents are like in the suburbs, as I just bought a house and moved to Natick last year, but from a decade of renting various apartments in the Boston area I’ll tell you that $1400/month is reasonable if you’re open to living with roommates. If you’re hoping to live alone, you’ll probably need to look further out from the city center than Cambridge.

They say they want to open a Restaurant there but even if they don’t the property is right next to a bar and Italian restaurant called agustinos, and it’s right across from a seafood restaurant with a bar called the dolphin(there are already apartments above this restaurant). There is also another development on 135 in downtown that’s going to build a 4 story apartment building with retail on the bottom floor in hopes of attracting a restaurant. The reason why there currently aren’t many restaurants in the apartment buildings is because the buildings are old so restaurants don’t want to set up shop there.

"I live in Natick Center and work at South Station (pre-COVID). Commuter rail was always great for convenience. But last spring (pre-COVID) I had to drive to work one day a week. If I recall correctly, I left around 6:40 (early to avoid traffic; I’m a nervous driver), took 16 all the way to 90, and then 90 into seaport. I would arrive around 7:30. It was crowded but moving the whole time. And honestly always took less time than I expected. But that was a pretty straight shot, might be more complicated if you need to go north or south. 
Something else to consider is that in “normal times” the commuter rail would run express to west natick, but only regular to natick center. So when needed, it could actually be faster to park at west natick and drive home from there than for me to walk to natick center. If you’re only going to work a few days a week and are willing to pay for parking, you can really live wherever in natick and just drive to west natick and park.

* Our birds are fed organic grains from their day of hatching and allowed to roam, graze, and romp on the Farm’s organic pastures.
* You are welcome to come and visit our turkeys at the farm any day during daylight hours.
* This year our birds will be slaughtered at a USDA-inspected poultry processing facility in Maine. Dressed birds will be individually inspected, air-chilled, vacuum-packed, and Halal-certified.

"**News style**

News style, journalistic style, or news-writing style is the prose style used for news reporting in media such as newspapers, radio and television.

News style encompasses not only vocabulary and sentence structure, but also the way in which stories present the information in terms of relative importance, tone, and intended audience.  The tense used for news style articles is past tense.

News writing attempts to answer all the basic questions about any particular event—who, what, when, where and why (the Five Ws) and also often how—at the opening of the article.

"CCTV surveillance camera video from the Natick Police Department of a shooting at the Crowne Plaza hotel.

Location: Natick, Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States

Date: March 26, 2019 (Tuesday)

Natick Police Department:

At 2:41 AM this date we received a call of shot(s) fired at the Crowne Plaza hotel. Upon receipt of the call several communities; Framingham, Sherborn, Ashland, Wayland, Wellelsey, State Police, Natick Fire and NEMLEC sent assets to aid this Department. Further support was provided by the Natick DPW in the delivery of barricades to help secure the area. We remain humbled and grateful for the expedient and professional response by all.

Initial units made an assessment to evacuate several of the hotel guests in an abundance of caution to secure the building in the event the suspect had remained in the building. Several areas were searched and secured until hotel facilities and management arrived allowing us access to the building’s video system. It was at that point it was determined the suspect had fled the area without completely entering the lobby. After allowing for ballistic and crime scene documentation and collection hotel guests were allowed to re-enter.

Detectives in conjunction with the services provided by the Massachusetts State Police are earnestly engaged to close this matter out. At present the subject who fired the weapon is unknown to us, but it is presently believed he is not from the direct area. The victim sustained minor injury not believed to have been caused by gunfire. The manner in which the victim and the assailant came to know each other and what precipitated the event are at task. We do not believe this event poses any additional threat to our community.

Additionally, we would be remiss if we did not mention that the staff and management of the Crowne Plaza Hotel remained professional and most accommodating throughout this event. They clearly work well together and they made our jobs that much easier. They are to be congratulated for their dedication to the safety of their guests under the literal threat of fire.

Anyone that can assist with the identification is asked to contact the Natick Police Department Detective Division at: 508-647-9520. You may report anonymously using our Online Reporting system found at www.natickpolice.com

The article leaves the impression that the folks who don't want recreational sales facilities in town are more organized and adamant about banning any potential business licenses. The quotes and concerns are the stock answers that people throw out when they're afraid of change.. ""think of the children"", ""it's a slippery slope"", etc.

What these people fail to understand is that with legalization the demand for these products won't change, only the supplier will. Precious Bryce will have to suffer the horrors of experiencing people consuming ""disgusting marijuana"", albeit those users will have paid some taxes to the government and likely funded some drug awareness campaigns that Bryce now gets to enjoy.

Revised Town Water Ban (Updated Aug 31st)
The Town has reviewed the capacity of our water supplies and town-wide water usage and has determined that the current water use restriction will be revised to allow limited non-essential outdoor water use. The Town will continue to monitor drought conditions and provide updates as conditions change.

The mandatory restrictions limit daily demand on the Natick water system to ensure adequate water is available to meet the public health and safety needs of the Town. This measure will assist in maintaining water levels in the storage tanks for fire protection and normal consumption use.

Compliance with this important water conservation measure will help avoid a complete Water Ban.


Residents and Businesses occupying a building with an odd number street address will limit non-essential water use including lawn and garden watering to Monday and Thursday from the hours of 5:00 pm on the select day until 9:00 am the following day.
Residents and Businesses occupying a building with an even number street address will limit non-essential water use including lawn and garden watering to Tuesday and Friday from the hours of 5:00 pm on the select day until 9:00 am the following day.
Non-Essential Outdoor Water Use Recommendation

Water lawns only when necessary. Please be aware that a healthy lawn only requires a maximum of one (1) inch of water per week.
Maintain your lawn at a height of at least two (2) inches. This practice will protect roots and retain soil moisture.
Water is lost to evaporation when watering during hot days.
Visit www.epa.gov/watersense/outdoor/watering_tips.html for additional watering tips.
Essential Outdoor Water Use Definition

Essential Outdoor Water Use shall mean those uses that are required for the following,
For health or safety reasons;
By regulation;
For the production of food and fiber;
For the maintenance of livestock;
To meet the core functions of a business (for example, irrigation by golf courses as necessary to maintain tees and greens, and limited fairway watering,
Irrigation by plant nurseries;
Agricultural operations as necessary to maintain stock or establish new plantings,
Pest Management,
Wash equipment to prevent damage and/or maintain performance
Irrigation of parks and recreation fields",t2_zzqic,oldermoose,0,1474045423.0,0,t1_d7pghia,d7pghia,True,tronics1,t3_4v6yzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Natick/comments/4v6yzb/any_further_updates_on_the_water_ban/,Any Further updates on the Water Ban???,/r/Natick/comments/4v6yzb/any_further_updates_on_the_water_ban/d7pghia/,1,r/Natick,0,1

My hometown and current residence has a population of 29,000 (which is less than 2/3 of the population of Natick), though even then, I wouldn't consider it a ""small town"".

I'm very much used to smaller towns.  Towns that are significantly smaller and quieter than Natick, without all the traffic and shopping and people walking around.

I just meant that with such a large downtown area, with so many more shops and businesses than the actual ""small towns"" that I frequent, you would think there would be a little more parking.  I was hoping someone might have some insight into a small public lot or something.

Rowley (Population 5,900) and Essex (Population 3,500) are much smaller towns than Natick (Population 46,000) and I've never really had too much of an issue finding someplace to park there.  

Rockport (Population 7,000) is small but has a lot of decent parking.

The six month ban on overnight parking and the expensive permit policy seem to be what makes Natick so much more difficult to park in.",t2_75v60,sabrefudge,0,1445564328.0,0,t1_cw9kwvy,cw9kwvy,False,[deleted],t3_3pq7xe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Natick/comments/3pq7xe/overnight_parking/,Overnight Parking?,/r/Natick/comments/3pq7xe/overnight_parking/cw9kwvy/,2,r/Natick,0,2
