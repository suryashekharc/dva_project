"We had them for awhile when we first moved into the house we have now, and one of their techs opened our gate without letting us know they were there. My dogs were in the yard and I didn’t know to call them in because I didn’t hear the truck pull up or get any warning that they were working on the house. Dogs got out and the only reason I found out was that I opened the back door to see if they wanted back in and they were gone. The tech didn’t even let me know he’d let them out, he was just at the side of my house doing his job like nothing had happened. I never swear at people in these kinds of situations but I absolutely ripped that dude a new one and used every swear in the book. One of the dogs came right back but the other was a runner and he made it several blocks before I could catch up to him, and I was home alone with an infant so I had to try to haul ass after that little idiot and catch him with a baby strapped to my chest.

"Had a child do something similar to me a few weeks ago. Was downtown turning into the small lot by fuzzys when some kids were on the opposite side of the sidewalk. I stopped to let them cross, and that's when the boy of the group weirdly started waving me through. I was super suspicious the way he was looking at me, but stayed stopped because his friends were crossing anyway. They got to the other side and the dude was still waving me on, so I said fuck it slowly went. That's when the mother fucked straight up walked into the back of my car and pretended to be hurt.

I knew he was full of shitwhen his friends came up and said I ran over his foot. Little dude was walking just fine--no screaming, no limping, nothing.

"My experiences:

Midwest Property Management - 3/5 - place was not the greatest in terms of upkeep, but work orders were fulfilled promptly; had a weird miscommunication about furniture / furnished/unfurnished state of apartment @ move-out, but my roommate was the one who handled that so it could have been an issue on his end

Highpointe - 3/5 - they present a higher-scale image and do very well with upkeep and maintenance, but they tried keeping our deposit without good reason and returned it after some stern messages.. management can be prickly if there is a perceived issue that they want to blame on you, but usually had no issues

Narrow Gate - 1/5 - looked at one of their properties and then was told to hire a lawyer or look elsewhere after I sent them some questions regarding the sample lease. seemed like a thinly veiled passive aggressive way to say, too many questions, move along now. Even Gage did better at answering my questions about the sample lease. Any place that dodges questions like this IMO is probably sketchy - what do you have to hide?

Location Properties - 5/5 - Natalie is AWESOME. She will be honest with you, be so patient and kind and answer all your questions, and she will even tell you things that legitimately help you while you are looking for a place to live. I hope she is still working with them because she was fantastic and so nice. Very happy! The other man I worked with who showed me another property was not as good as Natalie (he said he'd send a sample lease and never did) but Natalie more than makes up for that.

Hawks Pointe - 3/5 - they have lots of activities and free food, front office people are usually nice, but some of the higher ups could do a better job.... I remember they used to let people use the restrooms in the clubhouse and then suddenly they stopped being public. Clubhouse is open to all residents including those who do NOT live in one of the apartments nearby, seems scummy to force people to go to a gas station or nearby store to go piss when there are perfectly functioning bathrooms right there! Another thing is, they could do a better job at working with residents who actually do what they are supposed to do and have roommates who may not be doing what they are supposed to do. Seems shitty to take on an adversarial attitude and making an enemy out of both parties when you could instead work WITH one party. Could also do a better job being more respectful to residents and lose the snooty attitude of ""I'm a real adult and you're a dumb college kid wasting my time.""

"Been on Fi for several years. I used to have Verizon and was living in the Boston, MA area at the time. Couldn't get a signal inside the local supermarket or in my basement. Changed to Fi and had good signal in basement and in the supermarket. Fi uses Tmobile towers and will roam to other providers free of charge if it can't get a good signal. I have no problem anywhere in Lawrence with it. I also have two sim cards for my tablet and a wifi hotspot that were free with the phone plan. I just pay for any data I use on them same as the phone. $10 per GB. I've also used the phone in Ecuador and in Europe with no charge other than the usual rate I pay in the US. We have two phones and 3 extra sim cards and usually pay about $60-$70 for service unless on vacation where less access to wifi pushes our data use up. Maximum data charge is $100 above that it's free and I have not noticed any throttling.

Not sure what other companies offer on their services.  

Wi-Fi calling works good  My parents house has bad cell reception in their house so I connect to wifi there.  If I'm on a phone call, there is about a 5 second delay between switching from cellular but never drops a call.


Visual voicemail is great.  I am starting to find it annoying on my work phone that I have to listen to the messages.  On fi, it transcribes the message for you to read.

Call screening is a gimmick, but kind of fun to watch as it transcribes the conversation in real time.

Hold for you, works ok.

"Again, I *genuinely* don’t disagree with any of your sentiments. People should absolutely act with respect and tact, etc in public. But you should also consider my other point about maybe needing a change of view then? Perhaps *you* as a person are not the main issue, but the people you’re surrounded by or the areas you frequent are the issue? 

It sounds like you’ve been surrounded by some crap quality people, or at least experience some crap quality people on a regular basis. and I certainly didn’t mean to insinuate *you are the only problem*. Because I doubt that you are. And, I’m not an individual to creep through your post history and create some sort of decision about you as a human in ten seconds. 

If you *feel* like you’re being abused (I.e. how I’m describing your concerns) then you would likely benefit from a change of lifestyle in some way/shape/form. 

I applaud you for seeking professional help, therapy helped me in ways I can’t even describe. I firmly believe *everyone* could benefit from it. So I’m genuinely glad you’re taking care of your mental health. 

I hope you have enough help from a few choice family / friends to make the changes in your life you want to make. Some times stagnating somewhere can taint the beauty of your situation (was my issue). Maybe you need to go outside more, be around nieces/nephews more, adopt a Highway and get a group together to pick up litter. The world is certainly not our oyster - we aren’t robber baron children. But I will absolutely die on the hill that we have much more control over many aspects of our lives than we want to believe we do.

"I just started participating as close to home as possible, but I’m a die hard midwesterner whether h like it or not. 

When we bought our house here I introduced myself to all my neighbors. Bought them gift cards for Christmas, I’ve made an effort to borrow tools from them on occasion. Our direct neighbors and we get along so well we have them over for game nights now and our dogs play together in the back yard. Speaking of those neighbors, I always offer to help around whenever I can. I’m a pretty handy guy and help where I can (brought some materials home for them in my truck because they don’t have one, etc.) 

Apart from that I got involved at work. Volunteered to help run some charity events, joined a carpool group to save cash and fulfill my virtue signal requirement for working in the environmental sector (somewhat /s but also sort of true). 

Then I always ask my coworkers if they want to go on a walk during our breaks. Asked people I’d known to meet me at the dog parks or go on walks, etc. i also *love* breweries and we’re regulars at two places here in town on specific nights and the staff know us by name. They let us stay late because we always buss our own table and are as polite/friendly/helpful as we can be. I also work remote from a coffee shop and enjoy chatting with the staff. Not for any reward, I just genuinely enjoy being helpful where I can. Again, it’s that freakin midwesterner guilt that’s hammered into us haha. 

I just felt out people for a few years doing all of that and built a decent circle of a few quality friends. Hopefully that helps friend, consider looking around for events or hobby groups or trivia nights. The college groups can be a bit clique-y but most older folks enjoy a good convo. I’ve struck up convos with tons of cool people out on a brewery patio. Never know who you’ll meet.

Edit: Most breweries here allow dogs in patios and I *love* when people ask to pet my dogs. Like, *of course you can* he’s been an ~~a lying~~ annoying ass all day and needs as much attention as he can get! Help tire him out!

Edit 2: I also want to say I’ve had *plenty* of people come and go in this exact same time frame. We’re all different humans and have different morals / opinions / etc. It’s ok to have people who are only around for a short duration of time. If some one is pulling you down or doesn’t help lift you up - it may be prudent to find someone/some people new. Just my two cents, but not everyone will be our friends. That’s totally fine, I wish them well!",t2_3b9uu4d6,DarthH8rSurvives,0,1648520545.0,0,t1_i2il723,i2il723,False,Commercial_Explorer3,t3_tqa92p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawrence/comments/tqa92p/is_lawrence_a_welcoming_town_for_newcomers/,Is Lawrence a welcoming town for newcomers?,/r/Lawrence/comments/tqa92p/is_lawrence_a_welcoming_town_for_newcomers/i2il723/,2,r/Lawrence,0,2
"I’m afraid it’s pretty much that. Every now and then I’ll see a post on this sub about how another shop went out and then some one blames that group.

The discussion on here quickly centered around the aforementioned (alleged, possibly hypothetical) shadowy local restaurant organization that basically makes you play by their rules or pushes you out of business some how - but helps prop up “crappy” restaurants.

"LFK is dope. Certainly very welcoming. My wife and I moved here a few years ago and finally purchased a home recently to stick around for a while. Neither of us are associated with KU, although it feels like *nearly everyone and everything is* but to me that’s to be expected. It *is* literally the center of the city. 

We’ve made plenty of colleagues and friends through our jobs and we’re welcomed with open arms. We’ve also clearly disagreed with colleagues and acquaintances from work/city/etc. and no long spend time with them. But *that’s just life*. 

Overall it feels like a fantastic quality of life increase from where we came from (KC Proper). I work in Topeka and commute 3x a week. My wife used to work in KC and commuted 5x per week and just swapped to a full time remote from home position and couldn’t love it more. She’s home with the dogs and takes them for walks over lunch. 

If you’re concerned with crime there are public maps of that. From my experience the older generation *tends* to be more paranoid about it, and the younger generations *tend* to understand it’s all opportunistic crime for the most part. That being said; don’t be an idiot or anything. Having lived in some sketchy places myself before, I feel perfectly comfortable leaving my vehicle running in the driveway or *most* gas stations, leaving doors unlocked at house or vehicle. But overall I have the usual habits of keeping nothing in my vehicle or within eyeshot after having been robbed/stolen from on multiple occasions in KC Proper. 

Billions of coffee shops, when I work remote I work from one. The summers are best because campus is empty and students go home. During basketball season shit gets *wild* and I simply don’t understand it. I’m not a sports person but I can understand how people get jazzed about it. Tons of restaurants and breweries although I’ve heard recent mumblings of a shadowing *background restauranteur group* who may be pushing some small businesses out. I have no idea if that’s true or not. 

Depending on where you live there’s a myriad of parks systems to enjoy. Almost everywhere had an adjacent park space for kids/dogs/bikes and it’s part of why we moved here. 

The city utilities could be better, but from my experience they could also be *significantly fucking worse* and I’ll take what I have. Trash (I.e. litter) seems to be an ongoing issue and I’m considering doing something about it formally. When we go on dog walks I always take a bag and clean up after people. I don’t feel it’s due to individuals littering but instead the refuse that blows out of vehicles or trash collection trucks is the main issue. 

There’s tons of construction going on but that’s a net benefit in my opinion, no matter how frustrating it is. 

There are multiple lakes and ~~hiking~~ mild walking destinations within a half hour drive and a massive cycling community and routes around/through the entire city. Multiple off leash dog parks with hundreds of acres to take your dogs too. 

It really is pretty dope dude. Ymmv but I recommend it.

Edit: I feel an obligation to clarify after living in Denver that it’s *probably not* qualified as “hiking” but is still enjoyable enough.",t2_3b9uu4d6,DarthH8rSurvives,0,1648480895.0,0,t1_i2g3mb7,i2g3mb7,True,Commercial_Explorer3,t3_tqa92p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawrence/comments/tqa92p/is_lawrence_a_welcoming_town_for_newcomers/,Is Lawrence a welcoming town for newcomers?,/r/Lawrence/comments/tqa92p/is_lawrence_a_welcoming_town_for_newcomers/i2g3mb7/,23,r/Lawrence,0,23
"I don’t disagree with your sentiments. But I’ve lived tons of places all over the US for brief periods of time (figure a few months each place here and there, enough to get settled in and get a feel for the place but not long enough to settle down) and *everywhere* has everything you just explained. 

I feel like your explanation may be your truth and your experience but it’s certainly unfair to categorize an *entire city* like that. LFK is great, maybe you just need a change of view and some different colored glasses. Covid has been rough on all of us, it may be prudent to consider some therapy at Bert/Nash or KU or something too.

"My wife and I moved back here after missing it fiercely.  I'd ask what your hobbies are, but I can't think of any that don't have some sort of local or nearby accommodation.  Mass St. is a very friendly, fun place with several parades throughout the year, book stores, toy stores, bars and restaurants, etc.  For those with no relation to the uni, the college scene is isolated enough that you can avoid that scene altogether. 

West Lawrence has grown a lot over the last decade. It's grown to be a more conventional suburban scene, which is nice to have nearby imo.  The schools are better, and most things are nicer and newer, though there's a lot less character. There's moderate tension for the city between East and West Lawrence, as most infrastructure improvements and investments have been in West Lawrence for a long time.

Housing prices have increased, like they have everywhere else, but if you're eager to save on housing, there are decent rental options still, and adjacent places like Eudora have some more affordable options.

"I think you should be able to see breakdowns by day. If the usage is the same on the days you're SURE you were gone, there's probably something wrong (assuming you truly shut everything off/turned down the heat if you have electric heat, and that you normally use a good amount of electricity when you're home).

I'm not sure if Evergy has this option since I don't use it, but often utility companies give you the option of averaging out your bill over the year so your payments don't vary as much between months/seasons. Maybe that's what's going on.

So last month we used 967 kWH and got charged $134.72 and this month we used 694 kWH and got charged $130.76. I’m kinda new to this but doesn’t it seem like the price should have fallen more. And from December 8th to January 10th they claimed we used 967kWh. I was out of town from December 15th to January 7th and had all of the breakers off from that time.

"Hey everybody. [I made a post awhile ago about our local women's hockey league](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lawrence/comments/t53wmo/local_womens_adult_hockey_league_recruiting_new/).

We're really excited that this local paper wrote an article about our growing league. A couple of updates from my first post:

- [Our website is up and running](https://www.kcwhl.com)!

- We have a ""Gear Library"" for new players to learn before committing to equipment purchases. Details in the article and on the website. If you or your kid used to play and don't anymore and you have any gear you want to donate, let us know!

- When I posted before we were predominantly playing at KCIC in Shawnee, which is 30 minutes from Lawrence. Unfortunately there wasn't enough ice time available there, so a lot of games will be held at Line Creek which is a further away, in N. KC. (My wife and I live in Lawrence and we think its worth the hike!) Some games will still be in Shawnee. The calendar is on the website. 

If you're interested in playing you should shoot an email to KCWomensHockey@gmail.com.

"This makes sense from a business management standpoint - that increasing cost of living might drive up job applications and allow companies to reduce wages.

But what's hilarious here is people will roundly criticize this one guy, or Applebees, as being inconsiderate assholes for focusing on corporate profits *when pretty much every company and their management think exactly this way*.

What's good for the company isn't always good for employees, in the same way that the purpose of HR isn't to protect you, it's to protect the company.  People shouldn't get out their pitchforks at this guy, or Applebees. They should rethink their dedication to the idea that corporations and executives care much at all about the pay and lifestyles of workers.

"Uuuuuuugggghhh.

Leashed dogs can be aggressive. And depending on the type of lead/collar/harness as well as the grip of the handler, a dog can absolutely get out of their restraint.

And even if it doesn't get away? That dog is stressed out and unhappy and possibly dangerous. Maybe it's a sweetheart at home, but the second it starts acting like that, *it's stressed the fuck out*. A stressed dog is a dangerous dog. 

Even if the goal is exposure therapy, a) that shit should be done with the experience of a professional, b) it's not other people's job to accommodate your anxious, potentially dangerous dog, and c) are you *SURE* you're not doing more harm than good?

And yes, I know Rocky is just the sweetest lil baby at home. But as someone who has spent literal decades working with rescue dogs, stfu. Seriously. Shut. The fuck. Up. Sweet babies put in situations they aren't ready for is a recipe for disaster.

"Please get checked with those symptoms. If they dismiss them, find a new doctor who cares to get to the bottom of it or gives you a colonoscopy or endoscopy. 

While still less common, the increase in colorectal cancer among those aged 20-49 have increased dramatically the last decade and are highly curable if caught in the early stages.

I was 35 when diagnosed at stage 4 in July 2018 with very little warning signs and with the extent spread in my liver, about 80%, was told that cancer had been in me for at least 10 years. My GERD and stomach issued were dismissed and covered up with PPI meds.

I've been handed a miracle in my situation and through some amazing doctors and a life saving second opinion in California as well as at KU Medical Center for a reoccurence, found a way to currently be no evidence of disease but now work for a CRC organization which helps support patients and raise awareness to others about the importance of screening if you are 45+, have a family history, or are experiencing GI distress.
