"/u/According_Ad2000 I really wish you would engage with the issue at hand in the other thread instead of portraying me as someone who doesn't believe that women are victims of randomized violence.

In the other thread, a woman moving to our city for work was wondering if they would be she would be safe here. All the stats as well as the majority of anecdotes from women in this city (edit: in that thread) suggest that, yes, she will be as safe (or possibly safer) here than in the rest of the country. You, however, immediately supported the view that since the police were defunded in 2020, the city has gotten less safe for women, which is perhaps something you *feel* but isn't a universally agreed upon *fact*.

I made a shitty post referencing the way some men on this board exploit victims' trauma to paint Burlington as a city that is unsafe for women. I don't know your background, but I can see how it would come off as insensitive to victims of sexual trauma. It was a dumb and bad post. But it doesn't negate the way posters like yourself are exploiting trauma for political ends.

You know what wouldn't have prevented this crime for happening? More police. You know how I know that? South Burlington didn't defund their police. In fact, they have increased funding in the past 2 years... and this *still* happened.

There is an epidemic of sexual violence committed against women in America. According to available studies, 70% of that violence is perpetuated people the victim knows. You know how we bring those numbers down? Address the non-criminal elements in our society that allow that violence to take place. Educate men about consent, bodily autonomy, and gender equality. Give all citizens access to the material and medical help they need to stay mentally healthy. Encourage community outreach so that our neighbors help defend our vulnerable populations.

No society on Earth has eliminated violence from itself, which makes the notion of ""ending randomized crime"" a bit absurd, at least to me. If the country with the most staffed and best funded police departments on Earth hasn't been able to ""end crime"", then maybe ""more police"" isn't the answer and we should consider seeking alternative solutions. The first of which is to support the victim of this crime... what do they need to heal? What would help them feel safer? 

You don't know because you don't care about the victim. Instead, you've turned this into a way to ""beat"" someone you disagreed with on the internet. That's pretty shitty. I hope this woman has the support she needs to be able to feel safe in her community again... I'd imagine that she'll want some time off of work and access to counseling to deal with the mental trauma she's probably incurred. I hope that the existing police forces can work to catch this guy, but I'm not convinced that more money, more people, or more legal powers would actually aid in their investigation...

Any way, I hope you have a nice Sunday. I know I will.",t2_64vo0,pdschatz,0,1649008106.0,0,t1_i38ya41,i38ya41,True,redditreadit,t3_tvans1,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/tvans1/man_attempts_to_kidnap_woman_in_south_burlington/,Man attempts to kidnap woman in South Burlington at knife point,/r/burlington/comments/tvans1/man_attempts_to_kidnap_woman_in_south_burlington/i38ya41/,2,r/burlington,0,2

"Doing swell, sad to see violence being enacted against a woman, but failing to see how this relates to your claim that Burlington had a higher rate of sexual assault after 2020, thus making the city ""unsafe"" for women, when there are fewer incidents of sexual assault per 10,000 people than the average in the US.

Though possibly a bit stodgy for some the Shelburne museum is the primary historical museum in Vermont. Also the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum has a good collection. The beluga whale fossil at UVM is a bit underwhelming but interesting none the less and you can always stick your head into the art museum there. For a more uniquely Vermont vibe the crumbling museum for the bread and puppet theatre in Glover is different. Do drive by the somewhat horrific abandoned asbestos mine near Eden(?) on your way back to Burlington. Montpelier has a pleasant small town vibe for a state capital and I recommend the state house tour. After head to Three Penny tap room for adult beverages and food. While you are over there the granite quarries in Barre are available and there is a good hiking/mountain biking trail there. Unexpectedly the cemetery in Barre hosts some of the best gravestone artwork anywhere. World class!

"Crime has been on a steady decline since its peak in the 90's

AND

Vermont has a far lower crime rate than the rest of the country

BUT

Crime \*is\* rising in Vermont over the last few years, particularly violent crime.

AND

As an urban area, BTV is seeing a higher rate in the increase of violent crime.

As per FBI data:

Violent crime per 100,000

||2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|USA|362|374|398|395|383|381|
|VT|103|119|137|173|185|207|

Percent Increase from the previous year:

||2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|USA||3%|6%|\-1%|\-3%|\-1%|
|VT||16%|14%|27%|7%|12%|

This is, of course, why people can't agree. One group says ""Vermont is safe"" which is true as it has a much lower crime rate than the US average. The other group says ""crime is up"" which is also true. Violent crime has doubled from 2014 to 2019 in Vermont.

Unsurprisingly as a metro area, in Burlington, this increase in violent crime is at a faster pace. Burlington saw a greater increase in violent crime than the state trend. Violent crime in Burlington (per 100,000) increased from 44 to 140 from 2015 to 2019 — a 318% increase. Since 2019, the local trend has continued – exacerbated by Burlington Police Departments' own staffing issues (IMHO).

In a 7 month period in 2020, excluding VSP incidents, the ***entire state*** had about 170,000 incidents. The four towns of the Burlington metro area - Burlington, South Burlington, Colchester and Winooski account for 44,386  or 26%% of the entire state's incidents.

Burlington - 18,257

Barre - 12,307

South Burlington - 10,392

Colchester - 10,204

Saint Albans - 9,185

Berlin - 6,811

Montpelier - 6,263

Springfield - 5,779

Winooski - 5,533

Milton - 5,115

It doesn't take much to look at the Burlington crime data portal and see some areas that are concerning.

For example Stolen Vehicles

|2017|2018|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|49|32|55|62|137|

or Aggravated Assault

"Hello fellow Michigan resident! I (32F) have lived in Burlington off and on for about 15 years. During that time I also lived for about 6 (non-continuous) years in Lansing and East Lansing, and have spent a fair amount of time in Ann Arbor. 

I feel approximately equally safe in East Lansing, Ann Arbor, and Burlington. (And comparatively less safe in Lansing). For all of those cities, I would give the same advice to my fellow women: consider carrying pepper spray at night even if chances are good you’ll never have to use it; and don’t let anyone pressure you into a dangerous situation because you’re too polite to tell them to fuck off. And maybe late at night consider driving or even riding a bike over walking? But I have frequently walked alone at night and it was always fine. 

Safety is never guaranteed, but it is useful to remember that most crime, especially violence, isn’t perpetrated by random strangers on the street but rather by people we know. For example: sure, very VERY rarely a crazy hiding in a bush might rape someone, but more often it will be someone’s date or even spouse who will assault them. And in a college town like Burlington, I suspect most SAs happen in dorm rooms and frat houses.

There’s been a narrative being pushed in Burlington about rising crime, but honestly I don’t think the actual statistics bear that out. My suspicion is that politics has a lot to do with the narratives we tell ourselves. (For example, it makes sense that local politicians would be eager to talk about crime because that means we aren’t talking about the giant f-ing hole they dug in the middle of town or about how short staffed the hospitals are.)

It might be useful to remember that the population of Burlington is really small—maybe about a third of that of Ann Arbor? Vermonters think of it as a “city” but I am pretty sure in Michigan it would be considered an average size town. Part of what this means is that statistics can get skewed pretty fast from just a few incidents. 

The other part of what this means is that since it’s one of the only towns in Vermont that has visible homelessness (on account of being one of the only towns in Vermont full stop), sometimes people here get a little carried away with seeing any urban poverty as inherently dangerous. 

As for what neighborhoods to avoid— conventional wisdom is that the Old North End (ie north of Pearl and west of N Willard) is one of the more dangerous areas. I personally love the Old North End and while it may not be the best place for a midnight stroll, I definitely encourage you to go explore there during the day. That said, if you can afford a higher end part of town, it might be worth it. There is a stretch of town just north of Pearl street up by the university (roughly from S prospect down to N Willard) that I would be inclined to avoid not so much because of crime but because it’s full of drunk students and the semi-predatory landlords who rent decrepit houses to them.",t2_d65as5qk,Secret_Dragonfly9588,0,1648869520.0,0,t1_i32fwx4,i32fwx4,True,jmsouis,t3_ttjv8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/ttjv8x/is_burlington_safe/,is burlington safe?,/r/burlington/comments/ttjv8x/is_burlington_safe/i32fwx4/,5,r/burlington,0,5

"Look I went through a few drafts here that ranged in tone from snarky to dickish, but here's where I'm at:

I'm truly sorry that you or someone you care about has experienced any sort of assault, be it physical or verbal, from a man you did not know. I know you won't believe me, but I'm extremely empathetic to the victims I personally know. My comments were targeted towards people on here who have identified as men coming into this thread and using your experience with sexual assault to justify their own calls for more police, but I could see how a victim of sexual assault could misread it as an accusation that victims lie about their assault. That is on me.

All that said, simping for the cops isn't going to help victims in this city. Sexual assaults in Burlington are *down* since 2020. Cops are statistically more likely to be domestic abusers or rapists than the average US citizen. And in general, Burlington doesn't have a problem with violent crime... our number of incidents per 10000 citizens is lower than the national average. You are weaponizing your trauma to scare other women into thinking that Burlington has a problem because we de-funded (and then refunded, lol) the police in 2020, and then you're using your own tragedy to silence discussion about a nuanced issue.

"Boiled down answer. Rise in shootings, true. That number is only such an increase because it was so small some years. Also left out that most of these have been by out of state ON out of state people, and most of the time drug related. 

Statistics are just that. You can't get a real feel of things from people slapping percentages from cited articles. But they are also evidence of increased events, so should be taken into consideration.

My girlfriend has walked to and from work over a mile through this city to church street for almost 7 years now. It's like anywhere, you walk on familiar streets. Some streets are more ""sketchy"", others have people that are on there porches what seems like 24/7 (not college students). 

Burlington is a city to us who have grown up in Vermont, doesn't mean we haven't been to other cities. I can say I'd rather her walk around past 1 or 2pm here then just about every city I've been, but of course would rather walk out to meet her if it is that late.

This post is a good showing of the actual turmoil Burlington is in. We now go to reddit to share our opposite opinions, and we try to take an easy question and make it murky. People on this sub forget this is the internet, where people preach in the most radical sense they believe.

You ask how safe it is, I say safer than most places outside of Vermont. Don't care what anyone else has to say about it, I know I'm lucky to live here. 

Again, it's common sense that going out past closing times can be a very bad idea, but if you're worried about stuff like that most businesses that run that late have rules now that coworkers need to leave together.

"> That battery and rape against women is common nationwide.

This is a massive issue that most progressive men are blind to.

...

it is also massively exploited by conservative men who ignore the fact that most victims are assaulted by someone they know. The unfortunate reality of America's sexual assault epidemic is that the vast majority aren't perpetuated by someone ""jumping out of the bushes with a cloth covered in chloroform"" (as someone in this thread described), it's a woman unknowingly being served doubles at a house party and going home with a recent acquaintance un able to consent. It's a wife refusing to have sex with her abusive husband. It's a shitty guy who feels ""friendzoned"" by a Tinder date who refuses to sleep with him...

The people in this sub who claim there is an assault epidemic taking place in Burlington always rely on ""my female coworkers"" or ""my friend says"" because there's no reliable source that indicates that there is an uptick in random assaults on women in the area. If there was, you can absolutely believe that BPD would be taking about it 24/7... an epidemic of randomized assaults on women is much more motivating to the average voter than ""there were like 5 more 'gun incidents' this year than last year"".

Do I believe that women are getting verbally harassed by random people downtown? Absolutely. Is that unacceptably shitty? Yes. Does it cause women to feel unsafe? Yes. Should we believe women when they say they feel unsafe? Yes. Should we try to do something about this? Yes.

Should we extrapolate from there that women are getting assaulted in higher numbers and therefore it would be incorrect to describe Burlington as a ""safe city""? Absolutely not, what an absurd idea. So frequently *you* tie these issues to politics, but there's nothing but anecdotes to back up the idea that women are less safe than they were in 2020... in fact, the only data we have suggests that sexual assaults have declined since the police were ""defunded"".

And, yes, as #MeToo taught us, anecdotes can be important, and we should absolutely listen to women. Unfortunately, the woman being upvoted (and thus listened to) the most in this thread is the one painting the scariest picture for women. Other women down below have expressed that they do not feel the same level of risk:

>I’m a tiny women and I’ve never had a problem.
  
>I’m a short female who runs alone at night and during the day. I’ve had a few harassment issues and have been followed once (during the day). Burlington isn’t particularly unsafe from my experience...
  
>As a small-ish woman, maybe avoid after closing hours downtown unless in a group. [Burlington is] [s]afer than most small cities, but not without issues.

So, if the question at hand is ""will I be safe as a small-ish woman"" the answer is ""no less safe than any other women in America and actually there's a pretty good argument to be made, both statistically and anecdotally, that you will be safer than the average woman in America"".",t2_64vo0,pdschatz,0,1648835971.0,0,t1_i30fpzx,i30fpzx,False,jmsouis,t3_ttjv8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/ttjv8x/is_burlington_safe/,is burlington safe?,/r/burlington/comments/ttjv8x/is_burlington_safe/i30fpzx/,9,r/burlington,0,9

I get that treating chronically mentally ill patients is expensive.  But if you provide people with treatment they’re a lot more likely to reenter society than untreated on the streets.  With treatment comes the possibility of being a productive member of society which pays for that treatment.  This will sound horrible but it comes from experience in EMS, we are too slow to forcibly treat mentally ill people who pose a danger to themselves, others or can’t care for themselves.

"Burlington isn’t a city. It is a 40k college town. It has city problems but that doesn’t make it a city. It has the population of a large neighborhood in a real city.  It is an indicator of how out of touch some Vermonters are when they talk about Burlington as if it is Portland, Oregon or somewhere like that. I’ve heard people compare it to SF with a straight face. Drug addiction and mental illness/homelessness are more prevalent here than most similar sized college towns. There is a sizable population in Burlington that are apologists for things like running a meth lab on public property. Overall, however the way incidents are reported in the press and the way some people talk about the crime online does misrepresent things and presents the perceived “lawlessness” of Burlington in an exaggerated way compared to much of the US.

"It’s safer than most larger urban areas and not particularly unsafe for its size. Unfortunately I wouldn’t recommend walking alone at night in any comparable sized or larger city either. I would especially avoid areas that are just removed from the downtown core, ie leaving the bars to go to more residential areas of town is often where bad things happen since predatory individuals will look for intoxicated people who are leaving the bars and passing through less crowded and well-lit streets.

Like anywhere else violent crimes don’t typically occur at random, and the statistics don’t show any increase in random acts of violence or assaults or muggings. I got mugged at gun point here 10 years ago walking home from the bars alone very late. It happens, and while it’s not my fault I shouldn’t have put myself at risk.

"I'm going to give you the same copy and paste I give any of my friends who are apartment hunting here. You won't get any truly helpful tips, because there really aren't any. Renting here is a game that you don't want to be playing and make no mistake, there ARE losers. 

Even with constant attention to openings starting around this time last year, looking for 2.5 months, going to 2-4 showings a week, filling out EVERY application we could, 2 of my group of 3 (full-time working, well off, local, 21+) still needed to stay in a hotel for a month because the only place we could find was a month past our move-out date. The rental market is cut throat. People will over-bid for a place if they have the means. The only reason we got our place was because the agent showing the place knew one of our moms. 

Craigslist, just watch out for the scams and creeps asking you for ""favors.""

Zillow and Apartments were my main way of searching, but still watch out for scams.

If it seems too good to be true then 99% of the time it is.

Ask friends when their/their roommate's lease is up, see if it falls around your time. They can ask their landlords if it's possible for you to slide in your application, given that they've been a good tenant themselves. 

Call/ leave a voicemail, text, email, call/ leave a voice mail again, email again. 

I've been told by landlords and agents that listings get 50-100+ contacts in the first DAY of posting, and tenants that get chosen are largely done so randomly or in the order their application arrived.

You MUST rely on these techniques, so it was blindingly obvious to me that the BPD I had negative contact with did not have much training in them.  Theirs was totally self-defense driven, with no regard to how their aggressive posturing, refusal to make non-violent physical contact, etc, was escalating problems.

"Not necessarily, Burlington officers don’t make a lot of money and they can go pretty much anywhere else and earn more versus the cost of living here.  I’ve talked to several and they expressed frustration about seeing people who committed serious and even violent crimes who were given extremely lenient sentences or not even sent to prison because of Sarah George and her alt of alt left policies.

I’ve got an example for you, I never worked in policing but I did work in EMS.  Damn near half of our calls were psychiatric calls and it was common to see the same faces because they get brought in on a psychiatric hold pretend to mellow out for a couple days and get kicked back out in the world with a prescription they won’t fill.  And then they are back on the street endangering themselves, others or simply not able to feed clothes and clean themselves.  

Imagine how frustrating that would be, knowing that you’re accomplishing nothing.  Seems like it would feel the same way if you were out there arresting criminals, people who harm the community and at most they get a six hour time out in jail then kicked back out on the street to do more violent and horrible things.  I’m not fear mongering that Burlington is some hell hole I’m saying that people who commit crimes need to be separated from society for a time.

"Except that’s not true, all gun sales even between private parties require a background check and transfer through a FFL in Vermont.  Private party selling guns without the background check and transfer is nothing new, that happens in the strictest of states.

Gun control flat out has not worked because criminals do not follow gun laws.  There’s always someone willing to sell their guns to private parties without a background check no matter how hard you legislate against it.  This is largely because there’s no national Registry of firearms and no I’m not calling for one I’m just saying how it is.  

Gun control laws are inherently racist and classist, the gun control act of 1968 only came about when the black panthers started arming up because the police wouldn’t protect black people.  The NFA of 1934 came about because a handful of bank robbers were using sought off rifles and shotguns, you could still get one no problem you just had to pay for a $200 tax stamp meaning that only well to do people can afford these firearms.  And look at states who have instituted “assault weapon” bans where law biting citizens became felons overnight because they didn’t know they either couldn’t on their rifle anymore or had to neuter it to be compliant.  

It’s funny how there’s been so many hard and soft bans on guns at the state and federal level and yet gun violence hasn’t gone down, if anything it went crazy during the pandemic.  Murder went up 100% in Los Angeles during the pandemic despite having some of the very strict gun laws in the country.  Violent crime is still very low in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine despite having some of the least stringent gun laws in the country.  

Gun violence is largely a product of upbringing and is directly related to poverty.  Same deal for incarceration in general.  It’s a lot easier to blame the guns when it’s society who has failed entire groups of people namely minorities and the poor.  We provide substandard education‘s to the poor and keep them poor because it’s pretty hard to bootstrap your way out of poverty when it’s all you know and when you’ve been herded into ghettos.  It’s harder still when you go to prison and instead of the government making a true effort to rehabilitate people with useful job skills, a good education and mental health treatment we just lock them away and then kick them out at some later date branded a felon and unable to get a lot of jobs.

Laws will not stop gun violence nor violence in general.

">Asking people to leash their dogs where they are fully in their right to have them off leash is not really reasonable.

You're fully in the right to not leash your dog at:

"This is a big reason I actually moved out of Burlington. There was a week or two stretch in the summer of ‘20 where where i encountered an off leash dog every walk I had with my own. I’m a trainer and couldn’t keep putting my dog in that position. Burlington is still the only place I’ve lived where my dog has been attacked. It’s the only ‘urban’ place I’ve lived where people feel entitled enough to give their dog’s unearned freedom and put them in danger. 
From a trainer’s perspective when you’re with your dog and you encounter another off leash dog: 
Stay as calm as possible and try to maintain a loose leash. 
Create space, get between your dog and the off leash dog, advocate and protect your dog at all costs. 9/10 times the dog doesn’t want smoke with you (owner) and would rather interact with your dog. Standing your ground between your dog and an off leash dog will not only (hopefully) create some time until that dipshit owner catches up to their dog to leash them, but will score you BIG points with your dog when they see you in a position of advocacy. I use ‘no’ when vocally deterring an off leash dog from entering my space because a lot of owners use that as an interrupter/correction word. My interrupter with my dog is “ah”- this provides clarity to my dog so they don’t think I’m interrupting them by using ‘no’. 

If you don’t have your dog under voice control with 90% effectiveness and success  in any environment, your dog should be on a leash. Your dog does not ‘need’ freedom. If they’re off leash because they’re “shit on a leash” , that’s your fault as an advocate and handler.",t2_16if27yi,icedpiss,0,1648723351.0,0,t1_i2ty2uo,i2ty2uo,True,notuniqueadvertising,t3_tsmjwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/tsmjwm/dog_owners_leash_your_dogs/,"Dog Owners, Leash Your Dogs!",/r/burlington/comments/tsmjwm/dog_owners_leash_your_dogs/i2ty2uo/,28,r/burlington,0,28

"My dog is really friendly with people. Intimidatingly friendly. Unfortunately she has been attacked half a dozen times by off-leash dogs and is now reactive.

Ongoing problem everywhere in Burlington for many years. A truly surprising number of entitled residents and visitors who feel they are above the law. Loose dogs charging people and other leashed dogs all the time.. creating a lot of conflict. Zero enforcement of animal control and public safety ordinances by the City. Waterfront parks and bike path especially are out of control with scofflaws. Problems have amplified in the past few years with significant loss of basic community respect and laws enforcement during the pandemic. Don't forget about all the DOG SHIT piled up on the sides of paths and bagged dog shit thrown in corners or randomly on public and private property by entitled persons who are either too lazy or feel they're above the responsibility finding a public trash receptacle.

"Aside from what's been said here by dog owners who feel ""it's fine and my dog stays close and listens""

You are in the minority. Most dog owners that keep their dogs off leash don't have the the discipline or training to actually control their dogs off leash. You also perpetuate the problem by showing people who don't that it's not a big deal.

If you have full recall and control. Do everyone a favor when you off leash and have your dog come to your side when you first see someone else, move to the side and let them pass showing them that your are control. If you really are as in control as you say you are, your dog should have no problem returimg to your side and being momentarily leashed while you let a hesitant party pass. 

If you see someone gushing over your dog calling to them to say hi. By all means let them run up and say hi. But if your using public space and not following the rules, be respectful.

There are lots of reasons why people are annoyed by off leash owners not caring. One is rescue dogs. They can be super unpredictable if an off leash dog runs up to them if theyre on leash. Two, dog attacks happen and they can be so severe that people end up in the ICU. I know someone personally. People who have that trauma don't discriminate and guess whether your dog is nice and it's incredibly uncomfortable if not terrifying for them to see a dog off leash.

"Agree with you here! So many of the dogs on leashes are untrained and their owners can't control them. And retractable leashes are even worse. We have worked so hard to train against distraction and keeping our dogs respectful of other's spaces. They know that if they see people coming they sit and wait until they get the signal to let the people/dog pass or follow me to keep hiking.

I also have to add that my older dog is skittish and prefers to have her own space. She was attacked by another dog and the leashes made it worse.

I give OP the benefit of the doubt after reading their language. I was attacked as a a child and had 18 Stitches on my face. Luckily I did not develop a fear but the reality remains there are many people who do fear being approached by dogs for good reason. To tell them to chill out ignores the potential trauma.

"I got a degree in psychology and anthropology as a double major from UVM and a degree in accounting from Champlain. Personally, I would recommend Champlain. They work hard to teach you how to find a job, succeed in a job interview,  what skills make you attractive to employers, etc. UVM does not help you to see how your degree translates to job skills once you graduate. I found that very frustrating. Champlain's career center is phenomenal and extremely helpful while UVM's is not. On the other hand, I will always be grateful for the liberal arts education I received from UVM.

"My wife went to both colleges. Her experience at both were vastly different, because as many have said they are very different schools. Champlain being a private entity, has control over more of what they do and how they utilize their funds. UVM on the other hand, has more red tape and has less discretionary funding. 

Sure UVM has ""prestige"", but Champlain has done more for it's students than UVM has, overall. My wife's classrooms at UVM were usually damp smelling older rooms with very few chairs. Some, not most, of her professors were outdated or were teaching curriculum that was no longer used or outdated itself. 

At Chaplain, the buildings were kept up nicely and always clean. No overcrowding or waiting to see your professor because they had other obligations. 


UVM fucked my wifes billing up the week of her graduation and tried to land her with 5k bill because of lack of oversight. I'm not a huge fan of UVM but I tried to be unbiased. 

If you want the people to feign a vested interest in you, go to UVM.

If you want a more personal experience to college, and to feel like you're at an ivy league in Vermont, go to Champlain. 

""WHERE"" your degree is from hardly matters to people who care whether you can or can't do the job, unless you're looking at performance weighted value.

"COR is definitely a hit or miss but I’ll take it any day to having to take math/science/whatever else my friends are taking at other schools, even if some/most of them are iffy. For me, what I really like about Champlain is 1. Friendliness with the professors and 2. Being able to take classes related to your major right away. The small classes mean that you can have better relationships with your professors, and I think in my discussion based classes it’s nice because my voice gets heard when I want to speak. A few of my classes only have ~10 people in it. I’m not sure how it is at UVM, but I know my friend at UNH says it’s completely different there because there’s so many people and it’s lecture halls.
Being able to take classes related to your major right away was nice for me because I ended up switching majors after freshman year (and I never expected to). Had I started my major related classes much later, I would’ve had to do an extra year or more at Champlain. I’m a sophomore now and much happier in my classes.
The main con that I have is meeting people. I’m not on the main campus this semester, but even when I was (for the past 3), making friends was hard. And that’s not really due to my lack of trying, as I’ve been in 6 clubs and went to all of the dorms events (where I met the few people I do talk to). I think UVM might have more social of a scene, with so many more students and clubs. Additionally, setting up a third party study abroad has been a struggle at least for me, if you’re going somewhere other than Ireland or Montreal. (Also I’m not posting this separately bc it’s ramble-y and I’m basing it off what was mentioned above. They did a very good job of covering a lot of things.)",t2_al0ceh72,EchoOfAsh,0,1648598180.0,0,t1_i2nfy68,i2nfy68,False,bobbytriracial,t3_trscm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/trscm8/uvm_or_champlain/,UVM or Champlain?,/r/burlington/comments/trscm8/uvm_or_champlain/i2nfy68/,6,r/burlington,0,6
"Well, they're both very different schools so I have to ask: What's important to you?

Do you prefer small class sizes that would warrant more one-on-one with professors? Or would you prefer to blend in with a bigger class? Champlain is a pretty homogeneous campus in terms of culture (white, middle to upper class.. something I found a bit disappointing); is that important to you? This is Vermont so you can't expect much, but UVM will be more diverse. I don't see your best friend going to UVM as a huge issue because the schools are so close to each other, but if you think you might feel left out being at a different school, that could be important to consider as well. I suggest writing down a pros and cons list.

&#x200B;

As for me, I went to Champlain.  I loved it but it had it's drawbacks (didn't quite agree with the way Champlain handles certain issues regarding race, sexual abuse, etc.., but you'll get that at UVM too). I liked that it was small. I would see just about everyone consistently throughout the week and talking to my professors personally was easy. They always knew my name and what I was about, which is pretty sick. It's easy to walk around campus. Their dorms are cool - restored Victorian mansions and UVM's are your normal ""classic"" dorms. I think Champlain does a good job getting it's students learning in the field as opposed to the basic, in-class learning style (not sure how UVM works). What really roped me in was the core curriculum. I considered it well-thought out and a cool way to get through your general electives; however, I'm close with a few professors and they've told me it's changed since I graduated (2019). Also, many people hated it and thought it was useless. They are sorta philosophy/psychology/human studies type of classes. I liked them, though. If you're interested in studying abroad (or even doing service trips abroad - which is what I did instead of SA), Champlain makes it pretty easy. It's easiest to go to their other campuses in Dublin or Montreal, but you do have the option to explore further.

&#x200B;

The most important thing to mention, though: since they do a core curriculum you don't completely have all your general education. If you decide to transfer after the first year, it might put you back further than you'd like. You would most likely retake a bunch of general education classes bc the core credits don't transfer well. I've also heard UVM is much better for environmental studies since Champlain's focus is on gaming stuff.

ETA: Champlain's other good majors are psychology (what I majored in) and education. Business is boring. The ""art"" major can be time consuming because you have to pick multiple specialties and you can't minor in it. I found it difficult to get a minor at Champlain (so I didn't). If you're into gaming, then Champlain is good for that. UVM will have more majors/minors to chose from should you decide to change.",t2_33hc1i2w,stoneyanne_,0,1648597310.0,0,t1_i2ne25k,i2ne25k,True,bobbytriracial,t3_trscm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/trscm8/uvm_or_champlain/,UVM or Champlain?,/r/burlington/comments/trscm8/uvm_or_champlain/i2ne25k/,23,r/burlington,0,23

So it's easy to say that the legislature should enact more restrictions however each of us in the community is also responsible in some small way. Anyone can volunteer as a mentor. There are so many awesome programs that already exist- i.e. Mentor VT, Boys and Girls Club, King St Youth Center.

"Thank you, you’re very kind.  I respect that some people are scared of or hate guns but the overwhelming majority of gun crime is committed by criminals who could not legally own firearms.  Gun control has failed miserably at reducing crime while stripping law abiding Americans of their rights.  

Something gun control advocates forget or are ignorant about is gun control has always been racist and classist.  The gun control act of 1968 was an attempt to keep black and brown people from arming themselves during the civil rights area.  The national firearms act of 1934 requiring a $200 tax stamp for short barreled rifles and shotguns, suppressors and machine guns meant they were only owned by the rich.  Waiting periods sound great in theory but they prevent abused spouses or people who are being stalked or targeted from arming themselves if they flee domestic abuse or a stalker.

It really saves a bunch of time in the fall and spring for install, you don’t end up with adhesive on the edge of the windows, and you create 2 extra pockets of air instead of the one typical of the kit.

"Probably.  Gun control laws don’t work because gun control laws only impact people who follow those laws.  I’ve had people disagree but then why do cities and states with strict gun laws have high gun violence?  Restricting magazine capacity does nothing to stop criminals from obtaining and using standard capacity magazines.  Banning “assault weapons” hasn’t reduced gun crime largely because crimes committed with shotguns and rifles are exceedingly rare in comparison to handguns anyways.  Background checks accomplish little as does requiring private sales to be conducted through an FFL because there’s more guns in this country than people, there’s always someone willing to break the law and sell guns to private parties without paperwork.  

Now I’m not one of those cold dead hands types, I would honestly be willing to compromise (some) on gun rights if it would actually make a significant difference in gun violence and murders but it hasn’t worked and it won’t work.  It’s always well will strip some rights and we’ll see if this helps and when it doesn’t they strip more rights, Vermont hasn’t been hit hard yet but it’s coming.  gun laws are bans on gun ownership and gun rights and those laws are consistently broken intentionally by criminals and unintentionally by people who just don’t keep up with changing gun laws.  I’m all for punishing people who commit crimes with guns and those laws already exist.

The head piercer and owner Michael comes from a formally trained medical background and takes health and safety very seriously. I got my nips done there and couldn't be happier with the results. Don't fuck around and cheap out on shit like this. Tattoos and piercings are almost always worth the money you put into it they're not meant to be cheap. Don't trust shit like that.,t2_3hx3km25,gypsydocshoven,0,1648325825.0,0,t1_i28dgur,i28dgur,True,cvndyflip,t3_tohxzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/tohxzh/best_place_for_piercings/,best place for piercings?,/r/burlington/comments/tohxzh/best_place_for_piercings/i28dgur/,14,r/burlington,0,14
