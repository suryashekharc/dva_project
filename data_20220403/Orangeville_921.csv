"I have been here since 2018, so over four years. Before covid, people here were kind to anyone and you'd receive smiles everywhere. 

Since covid, it's been a little more tense and people are quicker to judge. I've only encountered one direct remark regarding my religion –  that's it. I suspect most racists or Islamophobes here are closet ones and won't go out of their way to bug you. 

I was the only hijabi in my high school until this year, so making friends or networking isn't easy. Don't expect people to voluntarily talk to you if you're a hijabi. If living in an area where your culture or religion is prevalent is a deal-breaker for you, don't move here; you'll be pretty disappointed. Teachers here are phenomenal, though, and they care a lot about the students. 

Overall, I like it here but I wish there was more Muslims or culture in general here.

I gave you my two cents but don't listen to me if you really don't want to. Just do a little bit of googling and you'll find that Orangeville can be like anywhere else in the world. We have had our fair share of gun violence and robberies and well.. crime in general :P

Your ethnicity has nothing to do with this in my eyes and as far as I can tell it shouldn't cause you any more problems than it would for a caucasian person.. in fact, if you have proper manners you may even find yourself more welcome than some white cracker motherfucker wearing his pants half way down his ass and slurring every other word he speaks while cussing out innocent bystanders for simply looking his direction lol :P",t2_4ux30l0r,TheUninterestingGuy,0,1646084481.0,0,t1_hytyh05,hytyh05,False,deadpakman,t3_t1w80l,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangeville/comments/t1w80l/moving_to_orangeville/,Moving to Orangeville,/r/orangeville/comments/t1w80l/moving_to_orangeville/hytyh05/,1,r/orangeville,0,1

I mean choosing to speed through a school zone is not comparable to choosing to not getting a vaccination. Its almost the opposite when you think about it. The ones fast and reckless and the other is slow and at least has thought behind it. A lot of the people that are protesting the mandates are people who are vaccinated. And just because someone is concerned about getting something that is fairly new doesnt mean we should force them. I dont see why we cant just test people to see if they have covid or not?

"I can't believe you need me to clarify my point at all, but I am taking the liberal argument against abortion and using it to mock liberal support for forced vaccination.

Then again, I used the liberal argument that the ICU's are filled with unvaxxed and the vast majority of those who die from covid are unvaccinated, and used that to ruin the liberal justification that everyone must get the jab in the interest of public health. If you got the jab and think it works your argument against the unvaxxed is done.

Then I ruined the liberal justification that the unvaccinated are a burden on the healthcare system, by pointing out that the obese are a far greater burden on the healthcare system and it again is a condition based on voluntary actions. That's the point of universal health care, everyone nobody is denied.

The point I'm making is, in Canada people are free to protest, and other protests have not done any better either, they've all been shit shows and everyone who supported which ever protest was more than glad to justify it to those who didn't support it or were bothered by it.

In Manitoba some dude ran over 4 protestors!

"Regarding your wife's clothes, it can be very helpful to rip out the builder grade shelf and clothes rail and install a more functional closet system. Go to some websites like Canadian Tire,, Home Depot, etc and type in ""closet systems"" to see what I mean.

Laundry can be very overwhelming for a mother who already has a million other things on her plate. There's things you ""have to do"" like cook supper. So if the laundry has been washed, technically it's done and it's so much easier to just shove it in the closet so you can get back to all the other things you have to do.

"Apartment next to me in the hall being raided by the Orangeville police at 3am. Deliriously asleep and thinking the police are bashing in your door (it was that loud), audibly saying ""alright lets break it down"", then they WERE bashing on my door to see who was in my apartment and if I was associated with them (like why), and to see if I could contact the superintendent afterwards. I'm sure he appreciated me passing on his number at that hour, actually he probably is though because he didn't have to replace a fucked up doorway in the end.

I've never put on clothes so fast, and been worried what was going to happen next, meeting 5 officers with assault rifles just outside my doorway.

The woman next door had some homeless(?) guy in her apartment for the night who was associated with someone who had just robbed a house and the police were looking for him...or something.

"I agree with the other comments regarding getting the water tested to see what you need. 
We are local, and have a water softener, iron filter, and a UV. 
I can't comment on price only because I can't remember, but we use Watermaker from in town. They did the install and any maintenance that has been required and we have always been happy with the service.
Something to note, whoever installs it, make sure they are installed in the correct order. The water softener should go first. Otherwise the hard water can plug up things like he UV light which means the UV cannot do its job. We had some neighbours whose systems were instead UV first.
Also, you can have it set up so that your outside taps are on a bypass so that you aren't using softened water outside in your gardens or wherever.",t2_3cz1b8ov,peace-love-snacks,0,1619570916.0,0,t1_gw4a5xj,gw4a5xj,True,Snoo73200,t3_mzyze8,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangeville/comments/mzyze8/water_softener_equipment_and_installation/,Water Softener equipment and installation,/r/orangeville/comments/mzyze8/water_softener_equipment_and_installation/gw4a5xj/,1,r/orangeville,0,1

"I have a little bit of experience in water treatment. Unfortunately I’ve been out of it so long I can’t give you a price. It will all depend on the brand, and amount of treatment you need.


Your basic water treatment will consist of a U.V light, sediment filter, and water softener. If your water supply is off of a well, you might need some other filtration (iron filter ect...) for your water needs. 


I’d suggest testing your water so that you have a good idea of what treatment you require. Next step will be finding a supplier and find the best deal for yourself. You can also save by installing the system yourself if you up for it.

"You realise the rest of the world has opened back up? Last year, a third of the deaths in North America were from heart disease. I didn't see us boycotting McDonald's.

This ""pandemic"" is killing less than .1% of the people that get it. And of that .1%, 80% of the people that die from it are obese and over the age of 65.

When this pandemic first hit, we thought we were dealing with something way more serious than it is, the problem is that the people in charge are too afraid to admit we have over reacted. Do some research and keep your TV off. Why has Florida completely opened up but has less covid numbers than California that has completely shut down?

"To be honest, I am really itching to get on that trail, so to see this go down is really awesome.

The industries were wanting to get more traffic on the line. The problem is they wanted us to guarantee that the rail line would be around long term, but we rightfully told them not to count on it.

The rail line is a community asset. It is not here for companies to walk all over us. If they wanted the railway, they should have been able to cover the full cost. We called their bluff, the railway obviously wasn't that important to them so finally, we are going to be using it as a community asset.

The problem is, some people are going to want to preserve the part through Brampton because they think it is important for transit to connect with Mississauaga.

From what I remember you do all your parking stuff in the parking lot in front of the center. Then you come out in from of zehres and turn left. You then take another left at the next stop sign headin towards Broadway and this street is a 50km/h which drops down to a 40km/h and is a school zone so you will fail if you don’t drop down. That’s really the trickiest part other than the parking. You end up making a right onto Broadway and loop all the way around to the highway and come back along highway 10 to get your highway practise in. Pretty sure they still make you practise merging on highway 10 and Broadway. A lot of this could have changed but that’s probably the gist of it.

"What products are they specifically making? (I honestly have no idea). Are there any reusable things at least?

I feel like the town would side with 'how many people are being employed there?'

As well, look at Florentina foods which is just opening up, and Quality Cheese in town, they inevitably use 10's of thousands of single use packages and containers for their products each daily. All of those come in **mass** amounts of  their own cardboard boxes and packaging from the suppliers. These are just two tiny examples in our small town that I can think of off the top of my head. The Clorox facility could simply be supplying other companies such as these. I'm not saying any of these are solely to blame, it's just that's how our society operates right now.

How best do we as smaller subunits of it actually tackle this problem? :/

Just looking at food production, look at your supermarket and by weight how much of the stuff being sold there ends as garbage? (All the packaging etc.). It's insane. You can keep going down the rabbit hole and look at how much food/produce is thrown out from the 5(?) grocery stores in town daily.

I'm not arguing against you by any means, agreeing and looking at the larger perspective at the same time.

Reverse Osmosis is a waste of money in Orangeville. It wastes too much water and the filters need to be changed quite often and are expensive.

"I lived in Orangeville for many years. I was saddened by how the small town feeling has mostly evaporated. The taxes are high, Broadway is a nightmare, traffic and parking wise. The town often smells like you are actually in the sewage treatment plant which they have been working on, constantly for as long as I can remember. The infrastructer is collapsing, roads are brutal, the water is horrible. Floods every year on the east end.

I guess I was just used to the way it was before they started jamming houses wherever there was a spare square of undeveloped land, lack of foresight on the planners and engineers part has been a big issue. More housing = more taxes but they spend that money on ridiculous things, see Broadways median etc, etc.

Lots of drugs, one of the highest per capita of welfare recipients, drug abuse and generally seedy underbody has a pretty strong presence, never mind the police.....

On the other hand, Its much better than Brampton, Mississauga etc. I wish you luck and congrats on the new place!

"Welcome to orangeville! 
 
Property taxes are extremely high here. It’s a constant fight with residents. I heard they just went up again. People in town generally feel they aren’t being spent well either.

I grew up in Brampton and caledon east, I’d take Orangeville over both of them.

The snow? LOL there are a few days a year where my husband doesn’t go into work in Brampton and we have a lifted truck with off road tires. Be very prepared.

The water is bad. You need a water softener for sure or your appliances and pipes will calcify and be useless. Also not many drink this town well water and most buy drinking water. The water often comes out of the taps reddish yellow brown.

Our car insurance actually just went up as did most peoples in the area. It was better a few years ago.

Couple of things worth mentioning. Garbage collection sucks. It’s very limited and you must use clear garbage bags so the garbage man can check what’s in your bag, ie no food, you have to compost up here. The wildlife also. Coyotes are everywhere, keep your small pets inside if you have them, there’s also a black bear on the north side of island lake that’s spotted all the time but never bothers anyone. Also keep your car doors locked!!!! There have been a rash of car break ins happening all over town, also license plates being taken right off cars. Oh also there’s a crazy lady that jumps out in front of your car and tries to get hit so she can demand money from you along Broadway and downtown, everyone knows about her LOL And finally come join the Orangeville q&a page on Facebook, it’s a good source of info!
