"Sure. Here's the path that a responsible parents thinking would take when it comes to taking their 3 year old and baby to a kite festival

So there's this really fun kite festival going on. Wouldn't it be a great idea to take our kids to it? Can't see anything wrong with it. Build family memories. Kids have fun. And mom and dad get to enjoy as well. Most average parents would fall into this category (like most of you middle-of-the-bell-curve dwellers).

The ones belonging to the upper echelon when it comes to intelligence will re-appraise. Granted, this all seems fun but this event is going to have tons of people. That means tons of traffic. That also means impatient and angry people. Now let's look at the enjoyment factor for us and our kids in this context. They are 3 and (whatever...let's say 1). What will they remember of this? Won't they get the same enjoyment going to a park say?. And for memories, a park is great too and we are not saying we will never go to such festivals but let the kids grow older. In the meantime we have a peaceful day.

I'm not sure if you knew about it, but when I went about 3 years ago, they had dedicated school busses that took us down there and then brought us back.

"Moving to Austin for new jobs this spring. Looking for a single family / duplex little house  to rent, and have a few questions:

How likely are we to be able to find one available for June 1 or July 1?

Is the best way to start just by finding a realtor? Any strong recommendations?

Should we consider a short-term rental instead and how does one go about finding those?

What are thoughts on Cherrywood as a home base from which to get to know the city? Our work is in St. Edwards / McKinney. Traffic advice welcome. Ideally I think we’d look for something closer like in Travis Heights / Galindo / Dawson or even Holly, but haven’t seen many houses for rent that meet our criteria.

Also: how do those moving PODS work and/or what’s the best way to move our stuff across the country?

We left the grocery cart, threw a $20 at the bagger (we were really uncomfortable with them having to re-shelve everything) raced home in the beat down Ford Focus. Picked up the wrist bands my family threw down on the front porch, hoped on our bikes, and raced down Lamar! The cars were already backed up at 12th and Lamar…we flew past every one!

"I take my dog to pet-friendly stores to socialize and desensitize her and I don't let anyone touch her or near her so she learns she can trust me not to force her into stressful situations. Once I got distracted by something I actually needed to buy after we had been there (my fault, I know), done some training, walking etc and she was super calm. Immediately someone who was sort of minding her own business trying to shop came near and my dog calmly left her stay and walked up to her, sat down in front of her, waiting for pets. This woman reached down and that's when I turned around... I said ""nope!"" calmly and apologized, gave my dog a couple quick taps on her leash and told her we were training. She looked embarrassed and I said ""I'm sorry, no worries! I know she is the one who came up to you, I'm not supposed to be distracted so it's totally my fault"".  It was certainly a positive interaction on both ends, my dog is definitely a people person (just is in the beginning stages of being stressed/reactive around others because she always gets approached/pet so we are countering and being strict with boundaries now before it gets out of hand, and so she can become more obedient with distraction). How bold of that person to let their dog off leash and assume they can control their environment?? That's a risk you take when you let your dog off leash. If they didn't want them to interact with anyone, they should have kept them on a leash until they were 1000% reliable.

For those who don’t know, this is the simplest and dumbest game.

But, you’ll find yourself playing it while you’re driving around over the next few days.  And you’ll chuckle to yourself at some of the dumb combinations.  Then you’ll be compelled to tell your friends.  They’ll have the same reaction, but they’ll start playing it too. 

The game is this.  Take the name of any car on the road and simply put “anal” in front of it.  So a Ford Probe becomes an “Anal Probe”.   That’s it.

"When I bought my home in Georgetown on the east side of I35 back in 2007, I talked to people who lived nearby.  They all had foundation issues after about 10 years or so.  

Best advice I got was to keep the foundation moist to prevent the expansion and contraction that happens when it dries out and then moistens up after rains.   It was a new home, so one of the very first things I did was create a landscape barrier all around the house that I planted some shrubs in and kept mulched.  I put in a drip system for those plants to keep the soil around the home consistently wet enough to prevent foundation issues.

"Hey yall.

My apartment lease ends at the beginning of next month and the house I was looking at was nabbed under me. I'm willing to rent for another year but have to get out of this crumby apartment complex that I'm currently in.

Can anyone suggest a quiet neighborhood or apartment complex for under $1,900/mo, 900sqft+, somewhat close to the Domain for my job (like 20 minutes or less would be okay)? If it is an apartment I'd really like to have my own garage. Also pet friendly for my cat.

I've gotten in contact with a couple of apartment locators and so far the apartments they have suggested have HORRIBLE reviews on Google and ApartmentRatings, all in regards to other people being loud, thin walls, cars frequently being broken into, and apartments being broken into.

"Looking for recommendations for chemical analysis labs and/or water quality analysis labs that you have had direct, positive experiences with.  

I'm on City water.  The hot water lines in my house have started to have white particulate matter coming out of them. When dried, it's like very fine sand.  It does not dissolve in vinegar, so it's likely not lime scale.  It's fouling the aerators, and I have to clean them out constantly.  It's getting to be a royal pain in the ass.  

I've contacted Austin Water about it, but they insist up and down that it's not their problem.  I've talked to a couple of plumbers, and they always tell me that I need a water softener, even after I point out that the water isn't all that hard, and that the particulate matter is probably not lime scale (because it doesn't dissolve in vinegar).

"It could be a midlife crisis thing shes going through, she might of pushed too hard to connect with the desired demographic of the show too and went too political and alot of other things. I dont think she was happy with herself, she was successful, sure, but she was a middle ages female who was always going to be overshadowed by Jason. But the show at its roots is Jasons show and he got to command it as so which might have been an issue  too for her. She got too serious on things and made me kinda not like her there. 10 years ago she was great, the last few years she was ok, the last year she was just a bad employee and she got canned because of it. plan and simple. I wish her the best and life, I hope shes happy and successful, I wish that for pretty much anybody regardless if I know them or not, we all have that right, but she had to go. She will find her way in the world I hope but maybe radio isnt it anymore, atleast as a person on it, she might be able to do things in the back ground like the technical side of running a show but I cant relate to her much if at all anymore. Hell, Jason knows hes getting older and might not be able to be the one who has the morning show, but look what hes doing, hes coming in every day, doing his job, doing other shows, podcasts, a whole lot. I think he will have a place at the radio station for as long as he wants in some capacity or another. But hes settled down some, hes got a great girlfriend, hes stepped in as a fatherly role to some extent with her teenager, Hes got side hussles that he was smart about like his rental properties and such and hes even looking to build what will probably be his final home to live in out in manor, build to how he wants it. Deb doesnt have that to fall back on I feel like. Sure, shes got some savings, her podcast is still getting sponsors and such but her attitude of being untouchable as the morning show host was her downfall. If she left with grace, maybe asked to go out as she was stepping down to take care of herself and was graceful about it she could be in a whole lot better shape as a radio personality. But its been a year now, this tread is a year old, so i was supprised by your comment on it and its like all things in life, it happened, it sucked for her, and shes doing her own thing now and trying to be successful on her own terms, if it works out great, if not atleast she tried, but shes gotta put in the work and i hope she knows that.",t2_cuq2n,jaybird323,0,1648998488.0,0,t1_i38b9ae,i38b9ae,False,GGNash,t3_lfgo8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/lfgo8u/deb_okeefe_was_just_fired_from_101x_for_reasons/,Deb O'Keefe was just fired from 101X for reasons unknown,/r/Austin/comments/lfgo8u/deb_okeefe_was_just_fired_from_101x_for_reasons/i38b9ae/,1,r/Austin,0,1

It's not a coincidence that African American and Hispanic families were redlined to the East side with less desirable soil for foundations.

 The split of the city with the expansion of I-35 is part of the legacy of those systemically racist policies like The New Deal, redlining by banks, GI Bills that people of color were purposefully left out of and restricted them from buying and building land west of I-35.

Basically it down drops the Edwards Limestone to the SE, which created more space for clays and other sediment to accumulate and allowed for thicker soil development. To the NW you have thin soil above the Edwards and fewer issues with settling.

"Also… I know a lot of people haven’t traveled in 2 years but PLEASE read and understand the rules on liquids!! Austin, we can do this together!

Nothing in a container over 3.5oz/100ml even if it’s half empty. Everything containing liquid in the little ziploc bag. If you just gotta have that lotion/makeup/BBQ sauce/whatever on your travels, then check your bag - they WILL find it in your carryon and you and everyone else WILL be delayed because of it. 

Please ask yourself, “did I throw a bottled water in my bag any time recently?”. Those tend to work their way to the bottom of a bag and get forgotten about. Happens more often than you think. 

Have a plan on how you’re going to go through security. Stash as much stuff as you can (coins, pens, wallet, etc) in your bag. Don’t be the person who needs the extra little tray for that. Let your kids know what they need to do in advance. 

Finally, there’s a special place in hell for people dumb enough to forget that they have a gun or ammunition in their bag.

I’ve been struggling for 4 weeks now with a cough. I don’t usually get affected by seasonal allergies. Two weeks ago I went to the doctor and tested negative for covid and a couple types of flu. They gave me antibiotics because they figured it may be a bacterial infection at that point. The antibiotics helped a lot initially but the cough still lingers. It’s been driving me crazy.
