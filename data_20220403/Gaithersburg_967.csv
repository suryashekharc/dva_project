"The office staff is useless and oddly snobby. The entire complex has a mouse/insect problem. The apartments are horribly insulated, to the point where I could literally feel cold air coming out of the outlets. The buildings are not well-sealed, thus causing the bug issue. We had a junebug infestation because they'd literally be crawling around the doors because the doors were not properly sealed. 

The walls/ceilings are PAPER thin.

The last two summers, they kept their pool closed despite nearly every other complex opening their pools, so in two years I never once got to use it.

There's also the balcony fiasco. While doing balcony maintenace a couple years ago, the balcony railing collapsed and a worker was severely injured. Turns out, all the balconies were rotting and falling apart. Their solution? They told all their residences to not use the balconies for the forseeable future.

"Hi joey- I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss and all the following bull crap you and your sister are surviving. It sounds really rough and probably feels inescapable. I see peoples suggestions regarding talking to the school counselor, and I also see your mistrust, and I hear it. I hate to beat a dead horse, but as a teacher in the school system, I really implore you to speak to your counselor. You don‚Äôt have to tell them everything, or anything. Just approach them, and say you would like to get some therapy. There are therapists that come into the school building, and work with students such as yourself. And your sister. I believe it‚Äôs free, and it will be very confidential, because it will be a person who is practicing as a medical professional.

"Seconding the other poster. Your sister's school should have a guidance counselor- it's not out of your place to contact them on her behalf, and they'll help you get resources for her. I'm really sorry you're going through this. You sound like a great big brother. I know it's hard when you're the oldest, but try to take care of yourself too. Maybe see your own guidance counselor. If you go, maybe your sister will see that it's not a negative thing.

"Hi, Joey, that sounds like a lot to deal with.

You said losing your mum has been painful, it can be really hard to handle all of the feelings that go with that. The name for what you, your sister, and your dad are going through is called grief, which is the type of feelings that happen after losing someone very close to you. 

Grief is really complicated because it shows up differently for every person, and even in one person, the feelings can change. Some people are very sad, sometimes people are angry, sometimes people don‚Äôt feel very much at all even though they want to. The feelings may be very strong, and the feelings can take a really long time to not be so strong. Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening for your dad. It sounds like your dad is also still very sad about losing your mum. Sometimes when we get too sad, we try to just push every feeling away, even happy feelings we have for other people. That can make other people feel like we don‚Äôt care about them, even if we do. Maybe your dad is still so sad that he‚Äôs pushing every feeling away. It doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt care about you, but your feelings of wanting him to be there to help you and your sister are still completely valid. He is having a hard time doing that right now. There are people that can help him and even groups of dada who are going through the same thing and find it helpful to talk about. 

It‚Äôs important to remember, though, that it‚Äôs not your fault he‚Äôs feeling that way, and it‚Äôs not something you or your sister are responsible for fixing. 

As others suggested, talk to an adult at your school, like a teacher, a guidance counselor, the school nurse, a sports coach, really any adult. Or if you have other family like an aunt, uncle, cousin, or family friend, even if they don‚Äôt live close by, you could call them. Tell them just what you‚Äôve told us, and they can help you, your sister, and your dad get the things you each need to start feeling happier again.",t2_55kuwr16,SwansonsMom,0,1646505450.0,0,t1_hzhbbn6,hzhbbn6,True,joeytravitz,t3_t6vlpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaithersburg/comments/t6vlpl/therapy/,Therapy,/r/Gaithersburg/comments/t6vlpl/therapy/hzhbbn6/,1,r/Gaithersburg,0,1
"Being a minor complicates things somewhat. That said, if your school has a counselor get in touch with them. You can get support outside of your father (who also sounds like he's dealing with some depression too).

You could also look up therapists in the area and email them. You might have to try a few. Just let them know you're looking for some advice on getting help and your situation (just like you did here).

"Yep - you done did it.

When it comes to school buses, you have to stop when the bus's red lights are on regardless of which direction that you are traveling, unless there is a divider between the two sides of the road.  In the case of a divider of some sort, only the traffic on the side that the bus is on is required to stop, and the other side is not required to stop.  In the section of West Diamond shown here, there is no divider, therefore both sides are required to stop.  I don't know how much of a case you'll have if you contest it, because it's a longstanding legal principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse, and the camera footage that you've provided clearly shows the vehicle committing the violation.

"> 2-income families with high-paying jobs

This is one thing, many are Feds with higher paying jobs too. Some just commute over an hour each way & live further out. Some rent until they can get a good down payment & the right interest rate.

I remember when our friends moved here from WV where you can afford mansions with tons of land for the price of some of our houses. The sticker shock was very real for them.

I know it's sticker shock but for less than $400,000 you're looking at a lot of townhouses or some small older homes.

Which isn't always a bad thing, just remember that you'll also need to factor in any commute if you move further out.

"$385k is on the cheap side for most of Gaithersburg for a house. I bought mine in the Relda Square area in 2017 for about $385k and prices have skyrocketed since then. You're going to be very hard pressed to find something at that price in the ""trendier"" areas like Crown or Kentlands. I'd suggest looking closer to Montgomery Village or the older neighborhoods of Gaithersburg.

Any of the public schools in the area are going to serve your needs quite well. MCPS as a district has excellent services for students with different needs. There is certainly variation between the schools, but they're all good enough that parental engagement is going to be a much bigger factor in your kids' success than whether they go to Gaithersburg HS, Quince Orchard, or Northwest.",t2_cdpbs,VVillyD,0,1630159070.0,0,t1_haol4gh,haol4gh,False,[deleted],t3_pd7n4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaithersburg/comments/pd7n4w/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Gaithersburg/comments/pd7n4w/deleted_by_user/haol4gh/,9,r/Gaithersburg,0,9
"Right now the DC area is a really aggressive housing market.  Most places have been selling for more than the listed home price.  The good news is that all of Montgomery County should be within 30 minute drive.  If are willing to live right at the 30 minute limit and maybe a bit over during rush hours, you can probably add Frederick, Md and even over to Laurel, Md.  (note: going towards Laurel will require tolls to get to Nist in 30)

However for your budget, I don‚Äôt think you are going find stand alone homes closer then 30 minutes from NIST.  If you have to have a home, I would look at Frederick, Md or that direction. Look at Mt. Airy and New Market as well. It will be pushing the 30 minutes with traffic and will probably be over 30 in the evenings.

If you are ok with a town home (shared side walls) you can find a lot of places for sale in the Gaithersburg area.  There are places like Kentlands and it adjacent communities that are really nice.  I find that Montgomery Village and Germantown are both mixed bags. It really changes from community to community. So look at a reality site and pick some communities, then go drive those areas in the evening and see if you are going to like living there.

"Pre-covid I did this every week day from Gaithersburg station. As a federal employee I signed up for Transit Benefits that covered the cost of the monthly pass. Parking at Gaithersburg is free (but not at Rockville station as it shares the lot with Metro)

It's fairly reliable. There are heat restrictions when it's hot so it goes a bit slower. 

They seem to hit periods of 4-5 months without any delays, everything is running on time, then they seem to have a month or two where there is dumb shit every other day and you're a little late getting in or getting home. 

Overall it's cheaper than Metro (metro costs over $5 a day in parking) and with less people getting off/on I find it easier to doze off or surf the web each way.

"My grandfather lived over near Lake Forest, and was a big train enthusiast. He always said there were about 50 trains a day. Between CSX freight, MARC, and Amtrak, a train would pass through Gaithersburg crossing about 50 times a day.

Due to Covid, I believe MARC has decreased the number of trains. I've also noticed a drop in freight going by. So during \*normal\* times it's about 50 times a day.

He had a type written schedule somewhere, but that was a decade ago.

"The preliminary investigation revealed that a 2020 Toyota Supra was traveling north on Muddy Branch Road approaching West Deer Park Road. A 2001 Honda Accord was traveling south on Muddy Branch Road and was attempting to turn left onto eastbound West Deer Park Road; the Supra and Accord collided in the intersection. Three unoccupied vehicles parked on Water Street were also damaged as a result of this collision. Investigators believe that the Supra‚Äôs speed may have contributed to this collision.

The driver of the Supra, identified as Stephanie Angelica Vasquez, age 25, of Plyers Mill Road in Kensington, was pronounced deceased at the scene. The front-seat passenger in the Supra, identified as Jonathan Charkas, age 35, of Garden View Way in Rockville, was also pronounced deceased at the scene.

The operator of the Accord is being identified as Heriberto Santos Gonzalez, age 40, of North Summit Avenue in Gaithersburg. He was transported to a local hospital with serious injuries. Two adult male passengers in the Accord were also transported to a local hospital with serious injuries.

"Emotional and aesthetic considerations aside (and, heavens to Betsy!, they are important whenever anything large and intrusive is slated for insertion into an established neighborhood), there is one key factor that Mayor Jud Ashman and the Council are preparing to overlook, and that is the illegality of the petition.

There are also other emotional and aesthetic reasons for the push back. Yeah, it's ""clean"", but it's still smoke and no smoke scrubbing system is perfect. Really, if Mayor Jud Ashman is dead set on building a crematorium in Gaithersburg, he can put it in his own residential neighborhood.

"We‚Äôre looking at moving to the Gaithersburg area from NoVA. There‚Äôs a lot of research on crematoriums presented in a neutral manner. I‚Äôd suggest people do their own research, or as a starting point check out the link below. Aside from the studies showing negative impact on health (most of which aren‚Äôt mentioned or adequately explained by OP), there‚Äôs also an environmental impact. I was surprised that the EPA hasn‚Äôt regulated emissions from crematoriums yet. I was also surprised to see that of the 2000+ crematoriums in the US, many are in rural areas or were blocked from residential areas because of the health and environmental concerns. I would have thought Gaithersburg would be considered sufficiently residential and such a business wouldn‚Äôt be permitted. 


I‚Äôm in favor of cremation and don‚Äôt find the idea of ‚Äúan incinerator for dead bodies‚Äù upsetting. It just looks like based on available studies and compiled research, crematoriums should not be in populated areas. Additionally, the US should look to the EU, which has regulated and placed limits on the chemicals emitted from crematoriums in Europe, making them safer for those living nearby and better for the environment.

"I agree with you that there were many good aspects about Park Station! I liked our neighbors, it‚Äôs an easy walk to Marc and the fairgrounds. BUT we paid rent using the web portal too and I always saved my bank statements and we STILL got notices of ‚ÄúFAILURE TO PAY RENT‚Äù literally taped to our front door for all of our neighbors to see. The staff kept saying that there was nothing they could do, even after I started including screen shots of my payments in monthly emails to them. Eventually we got a sign taped to our door that we‚Äôd have to appear in court. At that point I had to threaten to sue the management company, and they finally apologized. It was humiliating and incredibly frustrating. And the staff truly did not care. 

We also had a trash problem. I think people were frustrated with the changing trash service and so someone above us was constantly just throwing garbage off their balcony.

"I lived in Park Station from 2013-2017 and I found it to be a very pleasant experience on the whole. I never had any of the problems with the staff you mentioned. Our rent was paid through a web portal and we were able to set up an automatic deduction. The staff never once questioned whether we had paid rent, and even if they had we had a digital record of all transactions.

The only problem I had was with the garbage disposal service. When I first moved in everyone had to carry their trash to the only dumpster, which was on the far side of the complex from the leasing office/pool. We lived close to the pool side, so we had to walk our trash across the complex (through the parking garage) and down a flight of stairs to get to the dumpster. This wasn't ideal, especially if the bag of trash was heavy, and it must have really sucked for the people who lived close to the dumpster because it was pretty clear people would carry leaking trash bags through the hallway.

After about a year of living there they switched to a valet trash service. All you had to do was put your trash outside your door and 5 days a week people would come by in the evening and pick it up. It worked pretty well, but there were also drawbacks. You were supposed to wait until the evening (5 or 6 pm) to put your trash out so that the hallways weren't always full of people's trash. Most people complied, but some certainly didn't. This meant that there was inevitably trash cans full of trash in the hallways almost all the time, which could get kinda gross, especially in the summer.

Like I said, I moved out of Park Station in 2017. I don't know if they are using the same service, or if it's gotten any better. I'd advise walking through the halls (it's all open, so you don't need access to get in or anything) during the day to see if there is trash out. Otherwise, I thought Park Station was a great place to live.",t2_cdpbs,VVillyD,0,1594289572.0,0,t1_fxeq1n5,fxeq1n5,False,cavecavecave,t3_hntgao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gaithersburg/comments/hntgao/apartments_in_gaithersburg/,Apartments in Gaithersburg,/r/Gaithersburg/comments/hntgao/apartments_in_gaithersburg/fxeq1n5/,3,r/Gaithersburg,0,3

"I‚Äôve lived at Gaithersburg Station Apartments (moved out ~6 years ago) and Park Station (moved out 3 years ago). It‚Äôs obviously been awhile since I lived at either of them, but I really don‚Äôt have many too nice things to say. 

Gaithersburg Station had a beautiful, large kitchen and great pool, but our neighbors were terrible (and I mean terrible) and management refused to do anything. The building and common areas were not well maintained or cleaned. Their yearly price increase got so ridiculous that we finally decided to move just down the street. 

A 2 bedroom at Park Station cost the same as a 1 bedroom at Gaithersburg Station when we moved.

"Dear Grille Owner: wearing a face mask at this time is not optional, it's not a matter of decoration, it's not a matter of social rage du jour. It is a grave matter of the health and well being of your own employees as well as your customers. You say you're not forcing anyone to eat at your restaurant --- well, thank you for stating the obvious. You ARE however endangering those who do, and you are committing a grave moral and ethical error against your own employees who are subject to your authority as owner. I have been a customer of yours for a while. As of now, that relationship ends. You obviously don't care enough about your own employees to ensure that they are safe, why should we continue to care about your business?

&#x200B;

And I find it ridiculously ironic that you suggest we go find something else to occupy our time like volunteering at a nursing home or a soup kitchen! Both of those places will be sensible enough and will care enough about staff, residents, and customers that mask wearing will be required!

&#x200B;

As far as diversity and rich history go, let's EVERYONE not forget that the whole complex of slavery / war of rebellion / reconstruction and the interplay of European & African Americans is part of that history: the good, the bad, and the truly horrific.  Knocking down statues and changing songs, of all things, is nothing more than symbolism over substance. An irrational response to what are very real historical & cultural issues.

&#x200B;

We need to exercise reason and prudence before jumping on the historical revision bandwagon. Let's not forget that Abolitionism was not the sole province of the North -- there were abolitionists in the South, too! And there were anti-abolitionists in the North.

&#x200B;

Personally, I'd rather see that state song taught in every school in the state as part of the schools' history curriculum as a means of educating through real discussion. This is the state's song: what historical and cultural context did it arise from? What lingering issues does that song cry out to reform? How have we done over the last almost 200 years? What is your current situation and how can we all work to improve it?
