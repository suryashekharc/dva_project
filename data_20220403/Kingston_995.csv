"Decommodifying land would reduce the cost of rent and therefore a huge cost of doing business in this country, as well as just living. Rent-seeking is an extractive and parasitic process that hinders real productive activity and wealth generation in any economy, while also enabling gross accumulation of wealth to a small percentage of individuals and should be kept to a minimum. Even Adam Smith understood this.

I'm not proposing that all land be de-commodified though or that its the only solution. Its just one in a repertoire of solutions.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

"This is really interesting. My husband and I were just talking about this now that we're more comfortable going out and will perhaps have a date night. We were debating so many things. Does it matter time of day? For example, my daughter goes to bed at 715, so if we've put her to bed and the babysitter comes over to obviously makes sure she's ok, but will likely watch TV and eat snacks? Or is there a before bed and after bed rate? Do we pay less/more if we drop off and pick up the babysitter? Pay more if they're older, or older or have they're ECE.... 

Pre covid we paid $15 for our 17 y/o babysitter but would always round up....it does make for an expensive night. She's moved on to university so we're looking for a new one also and debating getting a younger teen in the neighbourhood.

"My wife and I used to have some fierce debates about this very subject.   One camp says it’s just a teenager watching / sitting on the couch while the kids play and there really isn’t much too it so wages should reflect this.  The other camp says we are entrusting literally the most important things in our lives to this person so wages should reflect this. 

I also believe in paying someone a living wage, no matter the age or task.  Personally we used to pay our sitter $15 per hour cash. Plus we’d supply dinner ( usually pizza or some other delivery ) and transportation if they don’t drive. 

$15 per hour cash is like $ 20 on the books.   Trying to nickel and dime a teenage over a few bucks just doesn’t sit right but thankfully we are past the sitter stage.

"Thank you sethprr0 for your effort to obtain and post your information. This post helps to refine my opinion.

The thought of, ""I believe that the city has council members that are trying to make that happen through community partnerships with the hope of federal and provincial funding""; I am trying to understand what *community partnerships* means.

My definition of community partnership would be Kingston City Council presenting a plan to the provincial and federal governments for help. The plan defines locations, available city resources, needed provincial and federal resources, and a public consultation process. 

My point is, I do not know what Kingston City Council is trying to commit to, and I would like to know? 

Why hide the thoughts and development plans from people who may want to express ideas?

The public consultation process could be divided to commiting and approving a project.

Lake Ontario Park should be a place of beautiful area for people to enjoy nature and being outside. Let's make Kingston waterfront beautiful. Lake Ontario Park should not be for temporary housing.

It's confusing because it puts a person with an opinion on the defence, to justify their thoughts and feeling, then try to convice people they should be silent. To that I say, No.

"I was down visiting the cabins this morning and I have spoken to council members. Just because there isn't a plan now doesn't mean that there isn't something coming soon.   


For anyone hoping for a community of  tiny homes (with plumbing etc.) I believe that the city has council members that are trying to make that happen through community partnerships with the hope of federal and provincial funding.   


For anyone who is concerned about the amount of money that has actually been spent I urge you to wait until you see the actual total expenditure. Those figures will be made public.  


There are community groups currently pressuring the city to find a permanent spot for tiny homes. Like others have said the most logical spot *is* Lake Ontario Park. With the right amount of advocacy there are hopes that something will be relocated to that spot.

"Sorry you're being laid off. Good to hear you have savings. 

We usually go to ""the basics"" for groceries, but Giant Tiger usually has some good prices on staples (if you join their VIP club, you get more savings). 

The library, as mentioned, has internet, if you can manage without it at home to cut costs. If you can't imagine your home without internet, make sure you're paying as little as possible for it. There's a big difference in price between Bell and Tek Savvy, yet the quality is the same. 

Some tips for living on less: 

If you live in the city proper and have more than one car, you should seriously consider getting rid of one of them if you can. The savings would be significant. If it means you walk more or ride a bike more, you'll also have the benefit of built-in fitness activity. Kingston Transit has really come a long way in just a few years. 

Eliminate all packaged/processed foods, snacks, and meat. Make popcorn on the stovetop and [potato chips in the microwave](https://youtu.be/gFGpHL276xQ). 

Drink only water and coffee/tea. 

Make your own oat or [coconut milk](https://simpleveganblog.com/coconut-milk/#tasty-recipes-13706) instead of buying cow milk. 

Choose foods that leave you feeling full longer - like oatmeal for breakfast. 

If you think you're feeling hungry, try drinking a large glass of water before reaching for a snack. If you don't drink much water now, try to up your intake throughout the day. 

If you find marked down spinach or other greens, you can freeze them to use as needed. \*this applies to other items, as well - consider bulk purchases on well-priced items if you know you can freeze them\* 

Make your own cleaning products. Fill a spray bottle with a drop or two of dish soap, 2/3 water and 1/3 vinegar for a handy all-purpose cleaner. You can make your own laundry detergent or if you have a dishwasher, dish detergent using homemade [washing soda.](https://www.thespruce.com/what-is-washing-soda-2145888) 

If you have a magic pot, learn how to make everything you can using it. Learn recipes that use beans, lentils, rice, etc. 

Soup can be your best friend in times like these. Make your own vegetable stock from the vegetable scraps left over from preparing meals - celery tops/ends, carrot peelings, onion ends, etc. just store them in a bag in the freezer until you're ready to use. 

The cheapest, best soup we make is from [Refika's Kitchen on YT.](https://www.youtube.com/refikabirgul)

Combine in a medium or large pot: 

* 1 C red lentils (rinsed)
* 1 onion, cut up into large sections (no need to dice)
* 8 C water

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a lower boil. Skim off the white foam that rises to the top.

As the pot of lentils reduces and thickens, melt 2T butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 2T flour and cook until toasty, stirring regularly - it will smell nutty and get brown. Then pour in 1C of vegetable stock, whisking constantly. Heat briefly, then stir into the lentils. Let it simmer a few more minutes, then remove from heat, stir in 1t salt, and blend with immersion stick blender until smooth. I serve it topped with whatever greens we have on hand.

There is a brand new fbook friends group I literally just started called Frugal Friends. It's a place to park these kinds of money-saving ideas to share with others. With Canadians realizing the greatest increase in the price of groceries ever in the past two years, so many of us are struggling to make it work.

"A friend had this exact thing happen last week (even on the third floor!). They called “greenshield” who removed and relocated it. It might just hang out fit a while and move on. They can climb even on surfaces they seem unclimbable. If not, maybe consider calling them or see if any if your friends have a live trap. 
Rabies can be pretty obvious but raccoons are also highly susceptible to distemper. You could look up the symptoms online but basically it presents as them acting confused, lethargic, etc. Basically “weird”. We tried to rescue some motherless babies in my neighbourhood last year. They’d do stuff like just stare at you from the tree while hanging out in weird positions or just sit in the middle of the road. We live trapped them and took them to Sandy Pines Wildlife Centre and they had distemper. The one in your picture looks pretty alert, but watch for signs of “weirdness”. 
On the plus side, distemper can make them easier to catch.

"You know I'll probably get downvotes for this but I don't understand the entire 'outdoor cat' thing. Causes so many problems and kills off all the bird species with how many there are + wild ones because of all the unfixed outdoor cats breeding.

I must see about 9 'wild/outdoor' cats every single day in my neighborhood. They run out in front of cars, bother the dogs walking by, kill small rodents and leave them around to where my dog wants to eat/sniff them.

Plus then you either have your cat never come back home and never know what happened to it (this reddit post is a good example of it or it comes back hurt all the time like my old cat as a kid.) If they never posted this how does the owner know where the cat is? It doesn't, ever. Until they take it into the vet but people stealing cats don't do that.

You buy a Costco gift card online (you don’t neeed a membership to buy most items on Costco.ca) or get a friend to buy you one in store. You flash it as your membership card when you go in and you can purchase as much $ value as you want even if it’s above the gift card amount.

"I agree with No Frills and Food Basics, I check the flyers, make a list and go to both. Produce can be sketchy at No Frills. It's gotten a bit better lately but was a nightmare in the fall. 

Definitely use coupons - it saves me at least 10% on my grocery bill every trip. Keep an envelope (or more durable, a pencil case) to hold coupons you see in the store aisles for things you regularly buy (or would, if they were cheaper). I usually try to combine coupons with sales. You can order coupons delivered to you free (or printable) from places like [save.ca](https://save.ca), [websaver.ca](https://websaver.ca) and sometimes brand websites). 

Also agree with the PC optimum program (you can also get 60+ points daily if you use the PC Health app, takes 5 seconds - pennies to some, for me it's worth the time and adds up).

Other apps that give you money back on your purchases when you upload receipts: 

Checkout 51 (has gotten worse lately, not as many offers for things I buy)

Caddle (at least 10c per receipt and sometimes offers on top of that)

Eclipsa (.25c per item you purchase off the list and it's regular stuff not specific brands - like carrots, yogourt, cauliflower, salad dressing). 

Receipt Hog (I find this one a slow earner but very easy to use and it all adds up)

If you shop online for things you can also earn a percentage back on Swagbucks which you can redeem for gift cards (like for Amazon, Starbucks, lots of other places). You can also get the Swagbucks for doing surveys and stuff but I think that's not worth the time they take. 

I feed our family of 4 (two middle school kids) on average $120 a week.

"Thank you MisterFreelance because [queensu.ca](https://queensu.ca) is not my typical source for news, so I do not know how to obtain information about Queens. This post is not for the reader to infer that I have negative emotions about Queens; in fact, the opposite is true. I want to present critisism about Queens and to provide reasons for my opinions. My opinions may change as I learn now information.

As of April, 1, 2022, I tried the link on the article, ""Principal Deane unveils university’s strategic framework"" called, ""working groups, their composition, and mandates,"" it does not work.

How do I learn what Queen's teachers and students did to understand Kingston's housing crisis? Did they offer their knowledge and expertise to Kingston City Council to develop a plan which has become a public crisis?

The same questions for the different public crisis - COVID-19?

Queen's stragetic goal point 5 is,  

""Embedding Queen’s in the community: building deliberate, strategic, respectful and mutually beneficial engagement with communities outside the University, including Kingston, the region, other organizations and institutions, and national and global networks that share our goals.""

I believe an arguement can be made Queen's has been absent from the community. My evidence is the site ""[https://www.queensu.ca/principal/news](https://www.queensu.ca/principal/news)"" is all about Queen's and not how Queens is involved in studying and providing solutions in the community. May be the articles do not exist because Queen's is not involve in providing solutions for Kingston?

I believe their news is evidence of the current leadership is not fuling their vision of, ""The Queen’s community—our people—will solve the world’s most significant and urgent challenges with their intellectual curiosity, passion to achieve, and commitment to collaborate.""",t2_f8tk0sa3,grisly256,0,1648835858.0,0,t1_i30fg1b,i30fg1b,False,MilesOfPebbles,t3_tt9tbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tt9tbv/queens_economic_and_social_impact/,Queen’s economic and social impact,/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tt9tbv/queens_economic_and_social_impact/i30fg1b/,1,r/KingstonOntario,0,1

"No Frills for sure. Make sure you use the PC Optimum points systems. Not only for the “member only” deals (no name cheese bars and shredded cheese bags on sale for 3.88 at NF this week) but the offers will help you build points on things you buy regularly. Member only deals also happen at Shoppers and Loblaws, quite often for pricey things like toilet paper and butter. You also get points for gas at Esso. 

I follow couponcutiecanada on Instagram. She often posts ways to get groceries for really cheap, for example Janes Chicken boxes were on sale for 6.99 and I used the Checkout 51 app to get $4 back on 2 boxes so they were 2.99 each. 

We only meal plan based around what’s on sale. In fact I rarely buy anything that’s not on sale! I’d rather buy toilet paper when it’s on sale before I am in need of it then buying it full price. If you have some room in a closet or under your bed it’s easy to make a stockpile. And you don’t have to go crazy with it or anything, I usually have on hand one extra package of toilet paper and kleenex each. Ditch paper towel and get some reusable cloths. 

Go meatless where you can! Chili, soup, omelettes, all great and cheap meals. If you need meal ideas use the website [Budget Bytes](https://www.budgetbytes.com/) for more ideas. 

Also price matching will get you further than driving around to different grocery stores but I do usually choose between NF or Food Basics depending what’s on sale. NF is a bit further but I like the PC points and have gotten about $40 in free groceries this year alone.",t2_61u1mu91,throwitawayyall99,0,1648834020.0,0,t1_i30asng,i30asng,True,PsychedelicSnowflake,t3_ttvi09,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/ttvi09/cheapest_grocery_stores_in_kingston/,Cheapest Grocery Stores in Kingston?,/r/KingstonOntario/comments/ttvi09/cheapest_grocery_stores_in_kingston/i30asng/,8,r/KingstonOntario,0,8

"Cut the cellphone bill down to a basic plan. Cut internet options to more basic plans. 

No Frills has probably the cheapest groceries. Cut out most meats, and replace with more lentils, chickpeas, and veg produce etc. Rice is obviously a good cheap staple, buy a large bag instead of instant rice boxes. Cook things from scratch, bread is like $3 a loaf in the grocery store, but you can bake your own for about $0.25 of ingredients (flour, yeast, salt). Ironically, the cheaper you do groceries the healthier it gets. Take the time and start meal planning and prepping which allow you to drastically reduce your grocery bill.

 Youtube is probably the best free entertainment you can use. Also you can leverage your extra time being laid off to try and learn a new skill, like basic programming (start with Javascript). Just learning anything can help keep you motivated and feeling productive.

Leverage extra time to focus on personal health. Start exercising regularly if you don't already. This time of year fitness without a gym membership is very easy to do. Ditch the gym costs and instead run outside, do body weight exercises. This also helps keep you feeling productive and motivated. Running room has some free group runs I think on tuesdays or wednesdays. Alternatively Runners Choice has runs as well. 

Check any monthly subscriptions you have and cut whatever you don't feel is worth the value. Many people subscribe to alot of streaming services that only really use one or two.

Check your car insurance if you have it, often you can get it discounted if you are driving less.

Not so much of an issue this time of year, but you can cut heating/cooling costs by making use of open windows at the right time, or dropping the heating by a couple of degrees and using a sweater. 

Kingston Public Library (shout out to u/KingstonFrontenacPL ) has a lot of free resources from books to internet access, and I think they have regular free events.

Checkout places like YGKThrift or Value Village if you need clothes or housewares. Much cheaper than Walmart, and you can often find some hidden gems.

"So this isn't a bad idea,  long term it really should be a goal.  For princess realistically we should be removing street parking entirely anyway. That would leave plenty of space for this.  

But one question,  why the loop at the bottom end? It's a major diversion,  and realistically the line wouldn't be this small. 

The best option really is that when we have a strong enough transit network to need trams, to build on princess all the way from Collins Bay rd down to the ferry.  Then another line over to the base and up the north side,  one on Bath out to collins bay, one on day's road and Gardiner,  another on John A (on the side though,  separate from cars so they can still go fast), another up division to the 401 from downtown,  and finally from the ferry along King St and front to the airport.


That sounds like a lot, and it is.  We wouldn't build that out all at once either,  it's too much to build in like 3 years.  But that should be the target,  because otherwise investing in a storage facility,  new tech,  driver training,  vehicles and track wouldn't be worth it for a small stretch.

"As someone who went to school for planning,  here's why:

Trams have a much higher rider density.  The space they take up is far less than busses for the same route. 

Trams encourage local development in ways busses don't.  A bus line can change route with some sign posts and moving shelters.  You'd have to lay new track for a tram line.  All this means is businesses and developers will build on a tram line because it isn't going anywhere.  Less so for busses.

Trams are quieter,  higher capacity,  better for developers,  less polluting, and newer models can actually go fast enough to be local regional rail. So they could be a train to Odessa and Napanee that seamlessly connects to downtown kingston.


That said,  although there are many cities around the world the same size or much smaller than kingston (and with much less money to throw around) that have tram networks,  Kingston isn't ready yet.  We need to move up to there. 

We need to build a bus network until we're kind of maxed out on it,  then build trams where the busses are failing,  and repurpose those busses for outer area lines.

As much as I'd love for us to have trams, it's kind of premature.",t2_n98kt4c,LARPerator,0,1648816290.0,0,t1_i2z4hdq,i2z4hdq,False,Blue_Eyes_Exodus,t3_tsc0aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tsc0aj/tram_route_idea_for_kingston/,Tram Route Idea for Kingston,/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tsc0aj/tram_route_idea_for_kingston/i2z4hdq/,2,r/KingstonOntario,0,2

"I believe their IB programs are quite similar.  Hopefully someone else will comment with more insight but from what I know they offer similar amounts of IB and French Immersion courses.

Safety wise they are equal.

The only real differences to note are that RND is not part of LDSB so they don't offer the LDSB focus programs, but it doesn't sound of interest to you anyway. They both offer IB, French Immersion, Dual Credits, SHSM.

"With your analogy, a farmer is a middleman, too. They buy land and farm houses and barns that are already there. Then they buy tractors someone else has built. They use seed someone else has grown. Then they sell their products to supermarket chains who make a profit. 

In both farming and rental housing require investments in capital and labour. Both make a profit.

And profit is the entire aim of investing time and money.

If you have a degree or any post secondary education, you invested in something and then using your labour or brains or by running your own business, make a profit. This is the basis of a free-market economy.

"My partner and I rented through this property company that is actually just represented by one man and we dealt with a very poorly maintained unit, the unit was filthy when we first arrived, the person we were told was the super essentially yelled at me when I tried to contact him during an emergency involving a neighbour. Things were not fixed when we're told they would be. Signs of electrical fire damage, mold, major pest control issues. The other neighbours would scream and yell during all hours of the day and night. There was a guy squatting in basement of the building, the landlord hid this from us until we had moved in then tried to involve us in the case. He has involved another tenant in the case. 

We were able to move after 5 months but had to throw out so much small appliances and certain items bc of the pest control issue.

(we took extreme precautions during our move and thankfully do not have any issues at our new location)

Tried to reach out to Queen's Legal clinic and they basically said because I am on odsp that there was no point in filing through the LTB bc the money would go back to odsp which I do not believe was accurate at all. We were trying to present a case of financial losses due to being sick from the mold and pest control issues. Which made my partner and I visibily sick for months. 

Through the process of living there I had to contact the Fire Marshall and the police directly on multiple occasions and I bet you any money the hoarder/squatter is still there even after the alleged two years of trying to get him evicted.

"Elliott Ave apts. They enter your apartment at LEAST 4-5 times a year, even for mundane things like changing smoke alarm batteries, as if they couldn't just leave them in your mailbox. Pretty sure they're actually just spying on you when they do that.

In the time I lived there they increased laundry prices 4 times, rapidly outpacing inflation, yet the dryers couldn't even dry a single load of laundry in one pass. 

My 2 bedroom unit had no fewer than SIX different flooring styles due to flooring being replaced in the past. The kitchen, dining area, living room, storage area, bedrooms and bathroom all had a different pattern. 

The building was ungodly hot in the summer time, and even too hot in the winter. I basically never had to use the heat in the winter because I felt like I was being boiled. I even had to keep my AC installed during the winter months because of this. 

My toilet got backed up several times even though I was buying the flimsiest and worst quality paper I could get after the first time. This eventually caused flooding in my downstair neighbors apartment which I was blamed for even though the landlords knew in advance that my toilet or the pipes going to it were terrible. 

Took them two weeks just to get me a fuse for my stove and they refused to give me a rent decrease even though I couldn't cook my own food during this time. 

They forgot to send me a rent increase letter one year then threatened to evict me because they only realized I had been paying the correct amount nine months later. I told them to get fucked and go to the board if they think they're in the right. 

They had my vehicle towed one time even though they knew in advance that I have a job that entails a ton of travel across canada/world and my car was in the parking lot while I was away.",t2_lby1opbk,suck_my_garglenutz,0,1648760547.0,0,t1_i2wd5bx,i2wd5bx,True,pahanakun,t3_tr3qtn,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tr3qtn/sub_needs_a_pinned_thread_for_bad/,Sub needs a pinned thread for bad landlords/property management companies,/r/KingstonOntario/comments/tr3qtn/sub_needs_a_pinned_thread_for_bad/i2wd5bx/,0,r/KingstonOntario,0,0

"Unpopular but realistic opinion: People invest in stuff.

If I check your mutual funds, I may find you're invested in REITS (which are also holders of housing), big oil, big Pharma and other questionable businesses with products we can't do without. 

Will YOU sell your RRSP investments? Opt out of your company pension because of the holdings? No.

Do landlords - and these are small landlords, NOT huge companies owning blocks of properties or you'd never find them - contribute to high prices for rentals ? No. If anything, an MP or other public figure has increased public scrutiny in the way they manage their rentals.

Rental properties are necessary. If you've ever gone to a post-secondary institution, you likely rented. If you're not from generational wealth, you've rented. We've all rented places. If the MP's didn't own their rentals, someone else would. Someone else would charge you rent, too. And someone else would expect to earn at least some profit on their investment. Your cannot have rentals without them being profitable. No one would invest their money into a rental if it wasn't. It's the same for every commodity. People invest = want to make a profit.

The solution is an increase in supply. As long as cities don't allow that except for large apartment buildings, the supply will be limited and housing will continue to be in short supply and ergo, priced high. 

I have room on my lot for 2 tiny homes (and by tiny homes, I mean places with bathrooms and kitchens). I'd love to have students or seniors share by yard, but the cost of the approval and then permits is so high, it's never going to happen.

"Costco often has pork shoulder and its a very good price, staff there are paid a living wage and its a huge (often two roasts together) amount of shoulder.

I've travelled the world and spent many a night in a loud, obnoxious hotel room in the middle of a city refusing to sleep at 3am.  You know what the move is?  Get your ass up, meet the people around you, and have an adventure.

No no, it's all good. I think they mean the internet as in the INTERNET, the global interconnected network, not the computers used to access it at the library. 

The library and all associated services/computers and bathrooms are closed inside the building. But google, facebook, websites etc.. all still run 24x7, if you have somewhere else to go, to access them.

I don't think they were telling you the library's internet computers were available.

...

If you have access elsewhere, the library **does** have services which can be accessed electronically, including ebook checkout:

In my time at queens, I can’t say I ever saw many (if any) older adults living within the aptly named university district. For good reason.

Then you blow millions on excessive police force presence for what? Some minor debauchery that lasts a day or two and only really gets out of hand because you turned it into a rebellion?

"Right now, we have a golden opportunity to get something done about the plight of the homeless, whether it's caused by finances, mental health, addictions or any of the other numerous causes.

On June 2nd is the provincial election. When Ted Hsu, (Lib), Mary Rita Holland, (NDP), or Gary Bennett, (CON), come looking for your support in this election, pressure them into coming up with funding and supports for these individuals. Doesn't matter who you've voted for in the past, pick the candidate that has the best plan to alleviate this problem the fastest. Health supports are a provincial matter.

The same thing goes for the municipal election on October 24th. We know from experience that our current mayor and council treat the homeless issue as an ""out of sight, out of mind"" problem, and fail to deal with it head on. Vote for a mayor and councillor that will make a difference, not just overlook it because their own interests are at stake. Quite a few of the cities councillors are landlords.

I don't feel unsafe or personally insulted about the tents that are literally steps from my front door. I don't avoid the area. What I feel is devastation that any human being is expected to live like this, and also extreme anger at our elected officials, the systems at play, and the ignorant prevailing attitudes such as yours.",t2_38sw7pib,gryffinpuff444,0,1648654841.0,0,t1_i2q6nmx,i2q6nmx,True,[deleted],t3_ts3cbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/KingstonOntario/comments/ts3cbn/illegal_camping/,Illegal camping,/r/KingstonOntario/comments/ts3cbn/illegal_camping/i2q6nmx/,4,r/KingstonOntario,0,4

"I have this thought that needs time to work out.

Here is the thought. Trailer parks are designed for modular homes with all necessities provided. KOA or the one near Cherry Valley in Prince Edward County are examples. 

I believe there is one in Kingston North end near Division Street but East. 

How is the KOA business doing? Would they sell to Kingston?

Trailer parks could be easy to create. Modular to move. Provide essential services to live.

"My first advice is a cliche statement with a solution to how to do it.

Cliché: To be a good leader, you need to be a good follower.
To make good choices, you need to be informed about the problem.

How do you do this? To become a good leader is to follow the past of previous leaders. Imagine your ambition to want to help Kingston be shared by your opposition, councilors, and previous people. 
Now, imagine how their vision is different from yours. Consider previous decisions as making the best decision from current circumstances. The people you're imagining are not opponents anymore, but people, like you, who are trying to do good that are different from you.

Make a good choice by learning all departments of Kingston. Learn about neighboring governments. What is the difference between Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington, Loyalist, Stone Mills, South Frontenac, etc.? 
What do they all have in common? This helps to learn what can be shared.
What makes each different? To help design services to meet constituents' needs at the lowest government level.

How? You didn't mention anything constructive or positive towards the cause of us all living together. You're just complaining about an eyesore, and the way you wrote it is just concerning! Camp wherever they want? You make it sound like you're talking about families going on vacation
