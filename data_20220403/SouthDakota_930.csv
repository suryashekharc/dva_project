"Pretty sure the prosecutor cited that as the reason Ravnsborg wasn't be charged under Vehicular Homicide in her news conference when the charges were announced.  Let's actually take a look at it

> Any person who, while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or substances in a manner and to a degree prohibited by § 32-23-1, without design to effect death, operates or drives a vehicle of any kind in a negligent manner and thereby causes the death of another person, including an unborn child, is guilty of vehicular homicide.

I think most people reading the law are going to conclude it requires being under the influence because the 'or' you cite is meant to cover two actions 'operating' and 'driving'.  Either of those actions needs to be done in the previously mentioned 'under the influence of alcohol, drugs or substances' in order for the law to apply.

Now, I don't know the intention behind this law, or when it was written, but if the intention was as you suggest to cover both under the influence driving and not under the influence driving, then I can only conclude that the law was written so poorly than lawyers cannot understand it to mean the original intention.  If that's the case then it still should be updated.

So in either case, it needs to be updated to fix the fact you can manslaughter someone in the state with a vehicle and get away with what is ostensibly a slap on the wrist.",t2_5eh34,acdcfanbill,0,1648822787.0,0,t1_i2zijop,i2zijop,False,noscoscouser,t3_tsw8yb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthDakota/comments/tsw8yb/ravnsborg_crash_investigation_file_released/,Ravnsborg crash investigation file released,/r/SouthDakota/comments/tsw8yb/ravnsborg_crash_investigation_file_released/i2zijop/,1,r/SouthDakota,0,1

"Here's my take on your highlights. I've lived on both sides of the State and been to a lot of the areas off the I-90 corridor. Always a grain of salt, yes?

Spearfish South Dakota

Bunkys BBQ - *Yes, their hours can be hit or miss, depends on if they run out of Que, bonus same parking lot as Crow Peak brewing.*

Leones' Creamery - *Yes, you won't be disappointed*

Killian's Tavern

Creekside Bean and Vine

The Panther (Philly Ted’s Cheesesteak & Subs) *Yes.*

*I'd suggest going to Barbacoa's too, if you like burrritos.*

*And visit Dough Trader - Best Pizza ever (cash only)*

Deadwood South Dakota - *Check out the open cut in Lead too*

Purple Pie Place

Sugar Shack - *This is way down 385, but yes you need a sugar burger in your life. Hit this on your long way down to Keystone. 385 is a beautiful drive if it isn't August full of Harleys.*

Deadwood Social Club

Creekside Campground

*Suggest = Lewies Burgers and Brews outside Lead*

Model Train

Summerset South Dakota

J.R.'s Rhodehouse BBQ PIT - *Pass, it's hit or miss*

Rapid City South Dakota

Hotel Alex Johnson - *Meh, downtown Rapid is cool*

Murphy's Pub and Grill - *Yes, get the sausage sampler.*

Watiki Water Park - *Stay here as your base of operations in Rapid*

Old MacDonald - *Yes for the kiddos*

Storybook Island - *Kinda lame but yes kiddos, first place I'd ever seen a wheelchair accessable swingset, thought that was really cool.*

Chapel in the Hills - *Meh, I mean I got married there but it's neat for 20 minutes. Canyon lake park might be more worth your time afterwards.*

1880 Train (Outsdie Rapid City in Hill City) *really cool but you have to decide if you're boarding* o*n the hill city side or keystone. it's going to take up most of your day for the trip out an back.*

*South Dakota State Railroad Museum (also Hill City)*

*If you're in the southern Hills: Black Hills Burger and Bun Co., Custer, SD But they're like the Franklin BBQ of burger joints, they have a massive line and run out and are done for the day. Might be a huge letdown.*

*the Mud Hole*

Press Start Retro Arcade (fix it felix?) - *Yes*

Colonial House (caramel rolls)  - *Yes, everything there is good*

Armadillo's Ice Cream Shoppe

Dinosaur Park - *great for the kiddos, kinda lame, nice view of the valley, cheap hot dogs at the gift shop, nice drive up skyline drive to the top of mt rushmore drive then hit Colonial House.*

Keystone South Dakota

Rushmore Tramway Adventures! - *Kid friendly*

Cruizzers Pizza

*Suggest - Get some saltwater taffy and fudge in town. You're going to go to Mt. Rushmore right? Do the badlands loop before you leave, or make that your drive back to Rapid from Keystone*

Murdo South Dakota - *Just keep driving, seriously. You should have spent time on the badlands loop. At least you skipped Wall Drug. You skipped Wall Drug right?*

Murdo's Drive-In - *There's a drive in? The best thing in Murdo is the spa tub king rooms in the Super8.*

Chamberlain South Dakota - *Nope, just Arby's and get gas. But stop at the rest area, really awesome statue, informative displays.*

Jalapeno Popper Grilled Cheese (Bread and Batter)

The Depot - *Nah, kinda lame bar food*

Ethan South Dakota

Farm Life Creamery

Souix Falls South Dakota

Phillips Avenue Diner - *Over rated, but chicken and waffles.*

Benson's Flea Market

Falls Park (Waterfalls) and Cafe. *Worth your time*

Porter Sculpture Park (Montrose just outside Sioux falls)

Moschell Farms (Fedora just outside Montrose)

Look’s Marketplace - *Yes, great food, market is spendy but they have really nice stuff and quality things.*

Grille 26 - *Meh, date night? They're hyped like Minerva's*

The Pickle Barrel - *They have great sandwiches, so does Gregg's Substation, I'm partial to Gregg's*

Bread & Circus Sandwich Kitchen - *Everybody loves this place, so will you.*

Flyboy Donuts - O*ver rated, go to C.H. Patisserie instead, but they are pretty good*

Butterfly House - *Yes, Kiddos, and there's an aquarium, don't step on the butterflies.*

Catch largemouth bass yhere all the time bit i don't eat the fish from there. There are channel catfish too. Lots of sunfish, fluegulls, crappie, different smaller sunfish. Really a great place to take the kids. If you catch rainbow trout there then it means they just stocked them recently and they are safe to eat.",t2_6gqla,stupidhoes,0,1648269245.0,0,t1_i25ot7t,i25ot7t,True,mpe1981,t3_toe7ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/SouthDakota/comments/toe7ha/traveling_through_you_beautiful_state_any/,Traveling through you beautiful state - any Suggestions,/r/SouthDakota/comments/toe7ha/traveling_through_you_beautiful_state_any/i25ot7t/,1,r/SouthDakota,0,1

"They absolutely deserve public shaming. From the public. I'm just saying the mayor should hold himself to a higher standard. He could have just as easily made his comment without screenshotting her post. These are Donald Trump tactics. On one hand, it's good that her comment was saved from deletion, but at the same time, that's not the kind of behavior I would want from my mayor. (thankfully he's not my mayor) 

Good point about doing this for the votes. He didn't give a shit when he was police chief. Racism hasn't dwindled in his tenure as mayor. One might even go so far to say that tensions have only grown in recent years, not that he deserves the blame for that.

"The place to go is nuggmd!

You pay $39(California) for a doc visit.

Fill out a questionnaire about why you need the medical card.

They will call you a few minutes after you have submitted your questionnaire. They send you a  pdf doctor's note within minutes! They will also send you a physical copy. You now have a medical marijuana card!

This is where you need to do ONE more step. You have to go to the tribal office and get THEIR card. This is in a different building from the dispensary. The address is 701 W Broad Ave, Flandreau. There will be a $50 fee and a quick application to fill out. 

The first time I went I thought I could get the card at the dispensary. They honored my doc's note (pdf I printed off) for a one-time visit. Not sure if they will still do it.  

I do want to say while the dispensary visit was pleasant, cops are posted up right there. I had one follow me to Egan and then turn around. Keep your bag stapled until you get home.

"Yep! 
""Even if you don’t have a medical marijuana card, the decision was made that on low level, low quantity offenses, it’s a waste of resources to try and enforce the very, very complicated version of medical marijuana that was passed by the voter,"" Minnehaha County Sheriff Mike Milstead said.

Under the state statute that takes effect Thursday, medical marijuana card holders or anyone with a recommendation to use cannabis from a medical professional can possess up to three ounces of cannabis at once. It also allows someone arrested for marijuana possession to have charges dismissed if they can obtain a doctor's recommendation after the fact.

it's in the best interest of Minnehaha County taxpayers not to pursue convictions for low-level marijuana crimes, he said.

Non-resident marijuana ID cards will also be honored, and tribal members who have a tribal-issued medical marijuana ID card will also be protected from arrest if they possess three ounces or less of cannabis.""

"Ouch, you bought the news of one side.  I've been EV only in ND for almost 8 years.  Texas went down due to not following federal regulations for power plant weatherization. So to save some money, to pay a bunch of executives, and some investors, it was worth it for them to ensure and kill, along with substantial damage to the economy. Nothing to do with electric vehicles. Only self-inflicted damage to enrich a few, but hurt many.

10%.?  Nope.  Plus we all subsidize gas so heavily most people technically can't afford not to be using an EV or public transportation, but again, it's all subsidized, mostly in our healthcare and disability funding.

A Tesla Model 3 has a lower TCO than the average new vehicle purchase price in the US.

As of 3-14-22

"I'm just saying I find it hilarious that you think the best thing the government could do to help its citizens is subsidize gasoline.

Maybe you should get a better job if you can't afford gasoline...

I want to understand how much you could possibly be driving that a 25% increase in has prices is going to break you.  Door dash? Pizza delivery? 

Do you realize that there is a finite amount of fossil fuels on this earth? That means that literally the only thing that gas prices can do is increase as you literally burn it all away idling In the drive through at wendys... 

Lastly, the government already does subsidize gasoline.  It's called ethanol and they pay farmers millions to grow corn so they can stuff it in your gas tank instead of eating it.  They have also given millions of dollars in bailout money to the oil companies that profit off of high gas prices.

Do you think any of the major oil companies will be losing money this year with high gas prices? The answer is no, they will make record profits and you will be the one losing money.

"I am speaking about all of these recent events in general. The issue I have with your assertion is that public servants especially police officers have to lead by example. We have Uber, buses, and dozens of other resources to avoid driving while intoxicated. You are the face of our legal system and easily could have called a fellow officer for a ride. There is absolutely no excuse and saying everyone has done it is not only unproven but unacceptable as an answer. Between these events, the AG, and national stories we cannot let the publics faith in law enforcement drop even further. The only way to do that is to ensure accountability and closely and aggressively monitor those that are there to protect us for their own protection.

I know you said you aren’t condoning his actions but you are excusing them and that’s a dangerous path for our society to go down.
