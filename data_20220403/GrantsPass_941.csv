"Thanks for the help. I will toss a posting out where you had mentioned. But it's kot a driveway. It's a 5 acre plot of land that we have lived on for 30 years. We purchased a mobile home and found a land owner who rented the land to us. He resently passed away and his daughter is selling the land put saying we have to move first with her only reasoning being that she is selling the land. From what I know that isn't a just cause unless she plans to live on the property or if she plans on putting a new mobile home on it to move family in but again she would have to specify that then actually do that she is simply saying she wants to sell the land and we have to move. Shit out of luck for her though, her eviction notice is written to a specific person that the rental agreement wasn't even for, and we can't move the mobile either without removing trees that she will not allow us to move as it's damaging to the property. But we wanted to know if she had legal right to evict with the intent of just selling the land.",t2_9zyw2mnf,Daedress,0,1647208151.0,0,t1_i0jiqv5,i0jiqv5,False,Daedress,t3_tcu0ro,https://www.reddit.com/r/grantspass/comments/tcu0ro/landhome_rental_laws_help_im_looking_for/,"Land/Home Rental Laws Help: I'm looking for direction on rental laws. specifically when the tenant owns the mobile home and is renting private property, not a mobile home park. can the tenant be evicted because the land owner wants to sell the land?",/r/grantspass/comments/tcu0ro/landhome_rental_laws_help_im_looking_for/i0jiqv5/,1,r/grantspass,0,1
"Check these places for help

r/LandlordLove (Title is satirical, they don't like landlords, so I'm guessing a post there might get you some advice.)

or

r/TenantUnion \- Title is as it sounds, you may not find help here, you may.  It's much more quiet, so I'd try landlordlove first, but either way on these you might find some advice.

Otherwise, I'm a part of those subs, so here's what I'd say if I saw this post on one of those subs.  (Gonna do a google search AFTER I post this, so check for edits in 5-10mins max.)

This is going to be a big legal gray area I'm sure, I'm going to do some google searching, but as far as I'm aware, it's plain illegal to use your ""Parking Space,"" as a home with an RV.  They consider it an ""Illegal, or improper,"" add on to the home or something like that.  (Obligatory IANAL nor am I a landlord, although I do have property manager family members, and sublet my apartment from time to time).

AFAIK, this is probably quite the pickle, and not what you want to hear, so the good news is, I could be absolutely wrong, but as far as I know, they could evict you with practically no notice at all as a ""Vehicle abandoned on property,"" however I'm sure if you took it to court, say were there when the tow truck shows up etc, or it was well known you live on the property, you may be able to take them to court, and get your proper tenant rights.  They'll likely just get fined as the property owners for violating the law (If I'm right on that).

Edit:  First Link.  General laws [https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors\_197.493](https://oregon.public.law/statutes/ors_197.493)  May not apply to your situation.

Edit2:  Not finding any SPECIFIC links to help, but what I have read, basically tells me that it is possible to rent out a driveway to an RV dweller, and thus if that's the case, you should be protected under any tenancy laws.

"> Isn't he creating jobs 

We don't need more jobs. Everywhere is hiring. There aren't enough people to fill the jobs.

> I think that the Lark would bring a new level of importance to the Allen Creek intersection

Which hasn't passed a traffic study yet, and definitely cannot sustain the traffic it will bring. A new Allen Creek to Lincoln Road bridge will be a welcome addition, and the Allen Creek punch through will be awesome, but those additions are going to be done by the state with appropriate traffic studies. Progress is good, but engineering is necessary.

> What about the high number of O'Aces and Purple Parrots and the like that are basically mini casinos for tweekers , why can they exist?

For 2 reasons:

1. Those machines are owned by the state, which means the money goes into the lottery fund and (ideally, eventually) back to the people through state funded projects. Yes, I know, it has its problems, but it does fit within the law as it's written.

2. Those buildings are designed as a bar first, with gambling added on, which is what the law explicitly allows. The Flying Lark was build as a gambling facility first, which is against the law, according to the state.",t2_44be3,scubanarc,0,1644935864.0,0,t1_hx1ff2d,hx1ff2d,False,scubanarc,t3_sqiepd,https://www.reddit.com/r/grantspass/comments/sqiepd/oregon_doj_opinion_finds_that_the_flying_larks/,Oregon DOJ opinion finds that The Flying Lark's gaming machines would constitute an illegal casino,/r/grantspass/comments/sqiepd/oregon_doj_opinion_finds_that_the_flying_larks/hx1ff2d/,1,r/grantspass,0,1
"> Why is the state allowed a monopoly on those in the first place? 

Because that's the current law. If Flying Lark wants to be a casino then they should have changed the law first, not built the building first. They simply went about it in the wrong order.

"“New card.” I try to act casual about it but I’m smiling proudly. “What do you think?”

“Whoa,” McDermott says, lifting it up, fingering the card, genuinely impressed. “Very nice. Take a look.” He hands it to Van Patten.

“Picked them up from the printer’s yesterday,” I mention.

“Cool coloring,” Van Patten says, studying the card closely.

“That’s bone,” I point out. “And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.”

"How many minutes are you willing to drive?

10 minutes? You're screwed. Land costs a lot within 10 minutes of downtown.

20 minutes? Look into Merlin and Murphy, and Redwood Highway towards Selma. Rogue River highway can be nice, but if you want your land to thaw in the winter this might not be what you want.

30 minutes? Williams, Selma, Rogue River, Hugo are your friends. They all have their problems. Williams is pretty hippy. Hugo has water issues. Selma has no police. Rogue River is pretty attractive, but also pretty weird.

"It's not hard to get delicious food in GP, we have a ton of amazing restaurants.

The Twisted Cork on 6th street is kind of fancy. Despite their fanciness have an amazing $11 burger with microgreens and a really good side salad. It's one of the best-priced fancy burgers in town.

Wild River is open Mondays and has great sandwiches and pizza. In fact, everything there is delicious. The fish and chips is amazing (most of the time, got some slightly soggy on the bottom fish once, but every other time has been awesome). $17 for fish'n'chips is a bit steep in my book. Pizza's are in the high $30's now. They are the only place in town with fake cheese available for those with dairy sensitivities.

G-st Bar and Grill is amazing. They have a great burger, great fish and chips, and a full sushi bar. Sometimes on Mondays the staff has seemed tired from a hard weekend. The burgers are $15 and the fish'n'chips are $17.

Thai BBQ is a dive, but it's probably the best Thai food you'll have. They have a lunch special for $8.50 that will leave you full. Try their Pad Thai, it's the best Pad Thai I've had at any Thai restaurant.

For really cheap and truly authentic Mexican food, Casa Amiga cannot be beat. They open at 10:30 and tacos are $3 each, and comes with homemade beans and chips. If you are a normal eater then 2 tacos will fill you up. Big guys can eat 3. Altertive in good weather is Lupitas on 7th street.

"I would totally agree on this one except I just recently found out some pretty scary stuff about the brand **Seresto**. Please don't use this for your dogs! They have been really harming them and for some reason they haven't been taken off the shelves. I've seen multiple things on it now but here's a couple links below so you can read for yourself if you want. I'm not trying to be one of those annoying argumentative reddit people, as a fellow pet lover I just want everyone to know that this brand I think alot of us have either used or heard of, isn't fricken safe! 
Apparently in March congress called for them to be recalled but I don't know what's happened. 

As far as brands that can be trusted, **Frontline** has a safe track record as far as anything I've ever read. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

"So if you blame them start letting them know how you feel. 

I remind them if they are too close to me that I am trying to protect the remaining indigenous people in my family.. 

I remind them that their ancestors already tried to wipe out my family with the introduction of European pathogens once, and how they are not going to succeed this time around either. 

I remind them of my Cherokee ancestors that perished because they were handed small pox blankets by the European settlers passing as they crossed the trail of tears. This is after being forced from their land and forced to walk sick as a dog through 6ft of mud for thousands of miles

It shocks them to see a very small, and a visibly white girl call them out on their bullshit. They look like a deer in the headlights because no one has ever had the balls to do it before. It is clear no one has ever talked to them that way in their community.  

If people are too close to you friggin tell them to get away from you. 

Start there at the very least!!!! Next? Start voting in better representatives. 

The complacency is allowing this crap to continue, and it is no excuse

Edit: I do not know why people down there thought they were so much healthier than everyone else, and that they were immune from this. All year it is all I heard… 

“We are so healthy” 

You all vote out every public service for your most vulnerable constituents. 

Your shitty GOP representatives could not even find a cooling center during the last heat wave. Everyone I know down there never goes to a doctor. They do not even have a primary doctor. 

Hospitals were literally closing down in rural communities everyday before the pandemic. Now you all want to force out the last remaining healthcare workers as well? Burn out is real, and if they are not feeling supported in their community they will continue to walk. 

The only level one trauma centers in Oregon are in Portland, and we only have two.. OHSU and Emanuel. 

How many people are shocked when they learn they have to be flown to the very city they hate with a passion in order to survive? 

Why don’t they stick to their guns if they did not want to get vaccinated.. and just ride it out at home? Why go to a city they hate, and to a hospital full of people that they do not trust? 

It’s because it is that scary of a pathogen.. that’s why! 

Do people really think the small hospitals are going to be able to save them? 

How long will it take before they realize that not every facility has access to ECMO machine? This is a machine that filters all the blood out of your body. Does not come cheap either! 

I do not know how much longer you all can rely on Emanuel and OHSU to care for your most vulnerable here in Portland. It is not looking good as we are now ordering morgue trucks.

By the way… 

As a public health grad I’d like to remind everyone that It is NOT a person’s constitutional right to go out and knowingly infect others with a highly contagious and deadly pathogen. Supreme Court already ruled on this by the way.  Which is why a mask mandate is allowed and is going to stay in place.

Trump’s appointee Barren shut the case down without taking any opinions from other justices. Usually means it is a cut and dry case.

He worked 40 something years for your community and never missed one day of work. Raised me all on his own after my mother passed from cancer. And this is how you all thank him?

"Local doc here. As much as I disagree with the JoCo commissioners turning down the money, I hate to say it but their reasoning is pretty spot on. 

That is, we have a huge antivax population here and in Jackson county, so I’m not sure that promotional campaigns would make that much of a dent in the problem.

I have these conversations every day with patients, and it runs the whole gamut from people with unreasonable and ridiculous concerns (it mutates your dna, it makes you turn into a spike protein factory that is gonna kill you in 3 years, etc) to people who just have a personal horror story (knowing someone who got really ill after being vaccinated, even though it’s almost certainly coincidence not causation, it’s hard to reason with that kind of visceral and personal experience).

Bottom line is that as much as this looks bad, and it’s definitely a shame that we’re likely going to have a really terrible couple of weeks and months here in southern oregon (that could have been prevented if we could get more jabs in arms), I don’t think this grant being accepted would have made a dent in the problem.

What’s going to make a dent is going to be when anti-vaccine and vaccine-hesitant people start to have personal experiences with friends and family dying or getting really sick from delta, and that’s happening right now.

Fauci's messaging and that of the CDC has changed as we learned things along the way. Science can change its message when it learns new things. This sometimes means that previous messages can be rendered incorrect or even moot. However, this does not make the messenger a failure, or a complete joke.

For amazing Thai food check out Thai BBQ.

If you want classic American-style Chineese food, head for the Hunan Garden.

"I remember pre-covid, the Dutch house was a good place to meet people. Even just chatting up and getting to know some of their workers. 

Most people around my age (19F) move away to college or around northern Oregon; Ashland is about a 45 minute drive south and has a lot of younger culture. 

Now that it's getting warmer, local river spots and other swimming holes are going to start getting popular, so that's another good place to go.

"I felt the same way at first you guys! But honestly as a person who will be fully vaccinated for over a week by the time Boatnick gets here, I'm glad I can go do something finally! And at this point if people don't want to take the precautions then I guess whatever happens to them happens.... Its not fair for all of us to keep being super careful for those who won't be anyways. I feel like at this point it's either get vaccinated or stay home if it's still an issue, and for those who don't want to then again, oh well. 
My only argument for myself is the worry about any of the kids who are too young to get vaccinated. And that's where if I was a parent I would have a big decision to make as far as staying home...

"I've had mixed results with them. I appreciate that I can call in to talk to my therapist and psychiatrist with Covid spreading around. I don't see the need to go into the office to just sit in front of a computer when I can easily do that from home. I have Medicare so there are all sorts of restrictions about what is and isn't covered. The first therapist I saw just wanted me to do worksheets and go to groups so I had to request to see someone else. Finding the right therapist is key.  


The medical/med management staff seem competent and I like that all my providers talk to each other to develop a plan for me. I also like the pharmacy in the building and appreciate that they're willing to mail my meds to me. My recent issues have to do with billing and the cost of services. They say they have a sliding scale, but I still feel like I'm paying a lot even with Medicare covering their 80%.  


I wish they had an online portal so I could see exactly what I'm being charged for and so I could make payments online.

"Oh definitely hit up the Barnstormers, it's a fantastic good time. Near to there there's actually a murder mystery and dinner place, I've never been to it myself but I've been dying to go, a couple of my relatives said it was super fun. There's a lot of fishing, you wont have a problem finding that any more than you'll have a problem finding good hiking. I've lived here for a while and spent summers here my whole life, there's not a TON to do here by comparison to a city, but it's a pretty danged enjoyable place to live, over all. You do have to tolerate a fair amount of brain dead rednecks that think Jesus personally built their hot rods, but eh, that happens everywhere I think.

A great place for getting your hair tended is the salon over at Club NW, they really go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and well tended, and you don't have to actually be a member to use the salon that's attached for your hair, massages, or anything else. Don't forget to hit Mod Pizza at some point, it's quite possibly the best pizza I've ever had in my life. When the warm weather's here and when we're not all dying of the plague, set yourself up with a boat trip up through Hellgate, it'll be an amazing adventure. Also, if you like critters, get yourself over to Wildlife Images, they handle a lot of locals and rescues and it can be a great opportunity to see some animals you don't usually get to see right up close, without a lot of annoying tourists in the way, and the tiny entry fee goes a long way to helping the helpless things we tend to ram our cars into. Speaking of which, ALWAYS drive safely, even in town, there are absolutely deer that roam the suburbs. Fort Vannoy Farms is a great place to get to for some fresh local veg, jams and jellies, pop corn, and all that good stuff. All these places are right in town or just a couple miles outside of it. Welcome to town, buddy :)

&#x200B;

Edit to add: Oh, also there's a back to the 50's week, canceled this year I think, but still, LOTS of amazing old cars during that week.

"Haunted? I have no idea, but the Granite Hill cemetery might trip your trigger. Plus it's free, so that's pretty great. There's some pretty amazing plots in there, and some that are terribly sad. The cemetery is so old that there are cavalrymen from the civil war buried there, and a heart breaking number of children's gravestones from the Spanish Flu. Some of the hillsides look like they're just solid ivy, but there's sarcophagi hidden under there from long gone families. The weirdest part, in my opinion, is this little bitty spot just off the back-middle of the cemetery where, looking through the fence, it looks like there's the remains of an old playground's stuff, and for some reason a shack with a working water heater.

"“New card.” I try to act casual about it but I’m smiling proudly. “What do you think?”

“Whoa,” McDermott says, lifting it up, fingering the card, genuinely impressed. “Very nice. Take a look.” He hands it to Van Patten.

“Picked them up from the printer’s yesterday,” I mention.

“Cool coloring,” Van Patten says, studying the card closely.

“That’s bone,” I point out. “And the lettering is something called Silian Rail.”

"Welcome! My wife and I and our kiddos moved here from Sacramento 6 months ago. The air is so much cleaner up here!

A few tips I’ve learned in my short time here:

Open carry is a thing. Don’t be alarmed when the person in front of you in line at the grocery store has their piece out in full view. 

WinCo > Safeway > Albertsons.

The 7/11 on 6th St is hella sketchy. 

Taprock’s pretzel bites kick serious ass, same goes for Catalyst Pizza’s calzones. 

I’ve yet to dare to try Oregon Mexican food (as Californian’s, we’ve been spoiled) but I heard the best spot is Los Taquitos. Avoid Si Casa. 

Housing here is ridiculous. If you find a house you like, be prepared to pay well over asking price. We’re FINALLY in escrow after being here for half a year.

Get your plates changed ASAP. Most folk are welcoming to Californians but my wife did have a couple of run-ins with locals that would yell at her in her car. 

AT&T seems to work great, Verizon has some dead spots (I have no signal at work). Locals swear by US Cellular but I’ve heard that once you leave the area, its service is less than desirable.

"Article:

The public health workers were driving back from a vaccination site in rural Cave Junction, Ore., on Tuesday when they got stuck in a snowstorm on the highway.

They knew they had only six hours to get the remaining doses of coronavirus vaccine back to people who were waiting for their shots in Grants Pass, roughly 30 miles away. Normally, the trip takes about 45 minutes.

But with a jackknifed tractor-trailer ahead of them, the crew realized they could be stuck for hours and the doses would expire.

So the workers made the decision to walk from car to car asking stranded drivers if they wanted to be vaccinated, right there on the spot.

“We had one individual who was so happy, he took his shirt off and jumped out of the car,” said Michael Weber, the public health director in Josephine County, Ore.

Another recipient, he said, was a Josephine County Sheriff’s Office employee who had arrived too late for the clinic in Cave Junction but ended up stuck with the others on her way back to Grants Pass.

Most drivers laughed at the offer of a roadside coronavirus vaccine and politely declined, even though Mr. Weber said he had a doctor and an ambulance crew on hand to help oversee the operation. He acknowledged it was not the typical setting for a vaccination.

“It was a strange conversation,” Mr. Weber said. “Imagine yourself stranded on the side of the road in a snowstorm and having someone walk up and say: ‘Hey. Would you like a shot in the arm?’”

Still, Mr. Weber said the public health workers had administered all six doses of the Moderna vaccine to six grateful drivers.

Mr. Weber called it “one of the coolest operations” he had ever been a part of and said it had been an easy decision to administer the shots on the highway.

“Honestly, once we knew we weren’t going to be back in town in time to use the vaccine, it was just the obvious choice,” he said. “Our No. 1 rule right now is nothing gets wasted.”",t2_ai7tb,soil_nerd,0,1611844050.0,0,t1_gl3bygm,gl3bygm,True,soil_nerd,t3_l6xtm7,https://www.reddit.com/r/grantspass/comments/l6xtm7/josephine_county_health_workers_stuck_in_the_snow/,"Josephine County Health Workers, Stuck in the Snow, Administer Coronavirus Vaccine to Stranded Drivers",/r/grantspass/comments/l6xtm7/josephine_county_health_workers_stuck_in_the_snow/gl3bygm/,3,r/grantspass,0,3

"> I'll just do it after the families are gone

I don't think you have to wait for the families to leave. I've seen some weird stuff at parks while kids are playing, and pullups would not trigger me at all.

There was this one kid doing parkour. And by kid I mean 18-20 years old. He was jumping from the top of structures down to handrails right next to little toddlers. He was a massive show off. It made me really uncomfortable because one slip and he could land on a kid.

He was so young and self-centered that I don't think he even thought about the possibility of hurting the kids. He just wanted an audience.

Doing a few pullups while the kids play? As long as there aren't kids under you that you might drop on, then I don't think anyone will even notice.

Any part or the rouge river trail ([42.6508360, -123.5865160](https://goo.gl/maps/rwN664BEkYsQGoLv7)) (I did the whole 40 mile thing this summer, it was fantastic)

East Applegate Ridge Trail is really great (warning: there is a short section of dirt road to the [42.2450537, -122.9782289](https://goo.gl/maps/Kdh1tQuRzsEayTGw7) trail head, any car can make it though)

Bolt mountain ([42.375574, -123.389515](https://goo.gl/maps/eMhTLuMLSquEXJoz5)) is fun


Cathedral park is easy and nice and close by.

If you’re into shitty trails that no one likes then go to the end of Elk Ln (42.3894478, -123.3717113) and poke around. There are a shit ton of trails there and usually no one around. I love it. Some good views too if you just keep walking uphill. I’ve mapped most of it in open Street Maps (use the app Maps.Me) if you need navigation.

Limpy botanical loop is a nice controlled 1 mile loop. Real easy. Pretty. Very limited parking, so ideal on a weekday.

Waters creek is a good bet for a two mile loop. Not too hard.

Greyback mountain has a cool trail with a bit of a drive, good if you have a half day to dedicate (42.1638480, -123.2906000)

All uphill, really close to town, but good views: Dollar Mountain (42.448381, -123.343069)

Mountain of the Rougue is BLM owned park, many miles of trail, lots of elevation, lots of mountain bikers, decent views, high exposure and little shade (42.416353, -123.15494)

"Hello I recently moved to grants pass from Hawaii. My loved ones family is from here.

My opinion so far during a pandemic so I’m sure it’s biased is as follows;

Outdoor activities are endless if ya get up and go 
Summers are hot and can be Smokey 
Sure there are some meth heads and people who have some serious issues. But where doesn’t have this ?
It’s beautiful
Cannabis is cheap and plentiful if that’s your thing 
Alcohol like wine and brewery’s are plentiful
And religion is also plentiful 
Lots of pro trump Republicans 
Lots of not pro trump people’s 
Cool small towns
Decent food, Portland is a short drive and so is San Fran if ya want that feel.
Got a local ski area mount Ashland 
There is a presence of racial tension in this area of Oregon, just my observation. 
Housing if you RENT is steep 
If you BUY it’s not bad depending what ya want / need / can afford 
Fantastic for animals of all sorts 
As for jobs, if you are qualified and well spoken with a good resume you can find some good work!
The coast isn’t to far !
People love to farm and garden and share

I mean real cuisine.  The Bohemian,  Goodness Gracious,  Laughing Clam, Blondies, horny Goat...and so much more. In a town of just over 30k.



Then there's the climate. Pretty hot most of the summer but we get our gardening and yard work done early. Usually a nice evening breeze. Tweaker in GP are no different than anywhere else in Oregon. We lived near Albany for awhile and Lebanon and Albany are about as bad as it gets. GP is not at that level.



My biggest complaint is the f*cking flies...they are insane in GP. But we still love it.

"100% agree. Grants Pass is okay if you like church, Trump, guns or marijuana. The last 2 summers have been pretty good but the ones 3+ years ago very smokey. In 2017 & 2018 we didn't see the sun from July-October due to heavy wildfire smoke, very depressing. House prices are very high and if you want land, you have to fight the marijuana & hemp growers to get some. If you live in the country, July-Oct it smell like a skunk day in and day out. Medical services are just subpar in the Rogue Valley and you often have to wait months to see a specialist. I often drive 2.5 hrs to Eugene to get medical tests done because i don't want to wait 3 months to get in around here. Schools are okay and outside of the city limits we often only have 1 sheriff on duty at a time for a huge county. In the past, if you were robbed outside of town, it took weeks to get a police report. Winters are pretty good with little snow, lots of fog and mild rain.

"I’ve lived in Grants Pass four years, and can only speak to my experience, but I’ve found it to be sleepy, but sweet. Lots of cute shops and pretty nice restaurants, but all close down early and on Sundays.  I have been lucky enough to avoid being exposed to much if any tweaker life.

Cathedral Hills trail system is where I would most picture hiking with your dog, and I love to do that myself. Agriculture is a big part of life for many so I imagine your gardening efforts would go well and you’d have access to all you need in that regard. 

Fires are a real concern. To second what the other commenter said, there has been heavy smoke most of the last few summers which has made it hard to enjoy the beautiful natural attractions of the area. As for winters, I’m from further north and I find them quite mild here. There are maybe half a dozen majorly snowy days in the winter, but that also depends on whether you picture living close in/on flat ground or out in the hilly outskirts.

The overall dynamic is quaint but very old fashioned which has its own major pros and cons! In the end, much depends on your neighborhood choice and your personal preferences.

"I live in Cave Junction (which if you move to GP you will hear plenty of shit about, lol) and I think Grants Pass is pretty nice.

The weather is great. Too hot in the summer of course but otherwise wonderful. Seems like the economy is going well. Downtown is one of the best I've seen in a city about Grants Pass' size.

Plenty of parks and I hear GPHS is pretty good. There is a lot of nature such as lakes and hikes within driving distance. The neighborhoods are very picturesque and nice.

Good restaurants. I like Abby's Legendary Pizza, the Hall, Mamosa's, Heroes Cafe and Circle J. Taprock is nice and fancy. Heck, they even have an In n Out (got one a few years ago, 2nd one in Oregon after Medford). 

The best sushi is actually in Cave Junction at the Junction Inn though. Don't let the building fool you.

People talk about the drug use as if everyone is on meth, but in my opinion it's not that bad and won't really affect your daily life. (Although I'm biased cuz I live in CJ, basically anywhere would seem like a drug-free paradise.

I am hoping someone will read this and think of some information or it will spark inspiration about what her next steps might have been. If anyone has any info to contribute, please let me know and I will update the timeline. Let's find Fauna! 
----

Fauna Frey Timeline 

2004: Fauna’s mother passes away.

2006: Fauna’s younger sister passes away.

2019: Fauna’s beloved pet golden lab passes away.

6/19/20: Fauna’s older brother Dallas doesn’t show up to work. Fauna, Dallas, and their father John work together building homes. Fauna goes to Dallas’ home and discovers her last remaining sibling has passed away from a heart attack. She attempts CPR.

6/27:Fauna and her dad John barbecue at their shared home. Fauna leaves, telling her father she is taking a load of items to the dump.

6/27: That evening Fauna drives her Jeep from Dexter, OR towards Grant Pass, OR. She spends the night in her car at an unknown location. She does not bring any luggage that we are aware of.

6/28: At an unknown time Fauna picks up a female hitchhiker and gives her a ride. She drops her off. [The hitchhiker’s identity is known to police and they have contacted her.]
Fauna goes to the home of her brother Dallas’ friend Shawn. She gives him some of her brother’s belongings. Shawn says her car looked empty. Making it likely that she had made it to the dump yesterday and unlikely that she was planning on camping.
After visiting Shawn, Fauna checks into the Super 8 in Grants Pass. She calls her father John from the motel. He says she sounds distraught. She talks about her mission to give some of her brother’s belongings to his friends. She mentions giving a ride to the hitchhiker and says the hitchhiker reminded her of someone that her and her father knew. She talks about kind people you meet in life being like angels on earth. She tells him she met with Shawn and wants to meet up with her late mother's boyfriend and a friend of Dallas. John encourages her to check into a more comfortable place like a cabin instead of a motel. Fauna tells John she will call him tomorrow once she checks in to her new hotel. Fauna tells her father she wants to shower and is going to the store to pick up some things she needs. This is the last known contact Fauna makes with anyone.
Fauna's credit card is used at two stores that evening after her phone call. At Big 5 Sporting Goods in Grants Pass she purchases a lantern, 3 flashlights, capris, tennis shoes, and a sports bra. At the Grants Pass Fred Meyer she purchases socks, VO5 Shampoo, Pantene conditioner, 2 Burts Bees, 1 deli sandwich, 1 bag of potato chips, some active wear clothing, and 2 cans of Foster. Fred Meyer video footage captures her walking to her car wearing a neon green and purple pull over. 
UPDATE: It has now been confirmed that Fauna arrived back to her room at the Super 8 after her shopping trip alone. 

6/29: Fauna leaves in her Jeep from the Super 8 between 8:30-9 AM with her bags and personal belongings. This is the last confirmed sighting of Fauna.
Fauna does not show up for her hotel reservation at the Weasku Inn in Grants Pass. The Inn charges her credit card since she never canceled her reservation. This is the last activity on her credit or bank statements.  

7/5: Fauna’s father reports her missing to police.

"Lake Selmac is cool for bass fishing and is very close.  Galesville Reservoir is an hour North up I-5 and is awesome for fishing.  I also recommend Applegate Lake, though not so much in the winter, it kind of sucks at low water.  There's also Emigrant Lake in Ashland which is actually closer than Applegate or Galesville, only about 45 mins from GP.  

Check out this resource from the ODFW.  Its centered around Medford but its close enough.

"Hire a local traffic court lawyer, fees vary from $250 to 5k depending on severity of ticket and demands from law enforcement or judge.

Sometimes cops can have a poorly calibrated radar / laser and/or you have a good driving record and you weren’t under the influence just in a rush.... the law is the law, but if it’s your word vs the courts they rest on the evidence itself.

If the cop was doing his job but didn’t dot the i’s or t’s the lawyer will submit a dismissal of the charges and you wont see any fee but the ticket, lose the case due to an officer of the law doing their best and you pay the fine (more than likely reduced) and the cost of lawyer... and the bump in insurance.

One word. It's their job to act overly happy and overly excited to see you. It's in their training to be as social and outgoing as they are. It's also their job to show ass, hence the low window.

You're like the dude that thinks when you go to a strip club, you're on a date with the dancers. You're not, it's their job to flirt with you and they want your money. 

You can make friends. Maybe go a meet up or something. There's grow mixers in grants pass. If you're interested in cannabis/hemp, i would suggest going to the next mixer. They are a lot of fun and they usually have good food.

"Honestly, I agree.  But for slightly different reasons. This may or may not be because I've been spoiled by all of the excellent shops up in Eugene since I moved here. But of the shops I've frequented over the years, Diamond has the least competitive pricing, some of the least knowledgeable budtenders and a top shelf that REALLY leaves something to be desired (step it up, intake manager).  That said, most of my experiences there came from 2017-2018 so things may be a bit a different.

"I do not understand why you think my questions require your answers. If you feel the need to answer them as you are, save your time.

I am not trying to convert you. I agreed with you that people should consider others and thought we had finished the discussion... they have a right to be outright literal and show reality and pour salt on the wound... even if it offends and by your definition which needs a court to define, traumatizes your mind... do you have kids?

Were you there?

I said you were proof to me that Jesus exists, if you say I am wrong, that’s your opinion and I respect your opinion. I do not accept it as my truth, because you do not know what I know and I don’t care to extend my belief beyond my own capacity to explain faith. 

If images traumatize, then the image of Oregon falling to atheism and godlessness traumatizes me, and that is my business... but the business in Oregon are suffering from taxes, mental illness, and rejection of President Trump’s MAGA agenda. Socialism sucks. Period.

Communism sucks. Period. Propaganda geared towards a globalist socialist agenda is the product of atheism and rejection of the church, not the Catholic Church, the human church. The Body of Christ the collective communion in God’s Word.

I don’t have an agenda, I don’t want your attention, but I would feel amiss if I didn’t clarify my intent and also ask a few questions just to get your point of view , because you are a very smart person and I can tell you think I am trying to set you up somehow which I am not.

If the image of a viable fetus, which I call a soul, is shown to people, do you believe tax payer dollars should pay for  the time, space, and language to explain the evidence at hand?

I am very glad I got to read and understand your point of view so clearly that I can share with others... this post will be something I greatly take care of and hope you will sustain the conversation as it moves to a larger audience...

It’s awesome you dislike President Trump... and fear any abortion that may have violated  the law being retroactively declared murder.

I mean, does that make sense?

If we do have a soul, because you say we do not, or at least, you don’t believe evidence exists of God or an afterlife to such an extent you would believe (why would it make any difference) what if the soul were to speak in defense of itself?

Would a fetus still not have a soul?

I don’t mean to disrespect your atheist fact driven belief, I am just trying to nail down what evidence you need that you declare as fact.

The Bible is historical and actually very accurate. Does the flood narrative repeat through history and the strange evidence denied by scientific communities is cherry picked for a confirmation bias ... similar to what people did denying Noah and his madman idea he would save his family and all the animals of the world in a boat.

Do I believe in the totality of these stories? Loosely, but they are definitely interesting.

I would say if there were some kind of irrefutable evidence, it would be a visible language that is both seen, and beheld. If that were to exist devoid of technology, would you believe?

Or would you discard it as a hallucination?

"1. “When to a Christian you are the proof.” Yeah, about that... pretty sure that there are a lot of Christians who don’t believe that I am the proof, nor is the general you. Also, you cannot prove a negative. This whole, “what evidence do you have that God doesn’t exist,” is a negative which we cannot prove (it’s also a question, not a statement, you should use a question mark). You cannot disprove that there is an invisible tea pot orbiting Neptune, but common sense tells us that there isn’t one.
2. I don’t destroy evidence. I search for it. The bible is no more evidence that God or Jesus exists than the Harry Potter series is evidence that a young wizard named Harry Potter saved us all from the dark wizards.
3. They hope to “save” people because of an ingrained design of their faith where they serve their faith by converting others and spreading their religion. It is a basic tenant of religions and cults. Find a flaw you can exploit as a sin, and if there isn’t one that is predominant enough, create one, and then offer salvation from an imaginary punishment that people will fear, in this case Hell.
4. No fetus rejects or accepts LGBTQ in the womb. Accepting that there are LGBTQ people is something we learn to do (or the opposite is something we learn to do) whether or not we are LGBTQ ourselves.
5. What if I could communicate with a clump of tissue? A fetus does not have the developed neurons to feel pain until the third trimester, and it does not develop the neocortex (the part of the brain largely responsible for our consciousness) until the same time. This is also a pointless hypothetical because we cannot communicate with a fetus, even after it potentially develops a consciousness.
6. How would hypothetically communicating with a fetus be evidence that God knew us in the womb and thus (through some odd thinking you are attempting to pawn off as reasoning) exist?
7. I don’t need to call them names, but I call them names, specifically ones that are accurate in describing them based upon their behavior in public. And I call you names like turbo because you haven’t demonstrated you are actually knowledgable on these subjects, just very opinionated and unable or unwilling to stick on topic. Also, you are confusing Christian values with Evangelical values.
8. Yes, off topic. You have routinely asked questions defining the topic of discussion only to try to take the discussion multiple different directions when you get flustered or cornered.
9. I don’t hate Christians, nor did I say I do. I hate what these Evangelicals did at the Saturday market and First Friday.
10. I didn’t call them the KKK. I drew an accurate parallel between these Evangelicals and the KKK, as well as Neo Nazis. If you are an adult and you don’t understand the difference then you have a serious comprehension problem.

Put your mouth where your atheism is, and get in their face and deny them their rights to traumatize kids.

If they aren’t correct in what they preach, what evidence do you have that God doesn’t exist, when to a Christian, you are the proof.

How do you destroy the evidence? Live for your flesh, deny God’s Son, and according to their doctrine, you go to hell.

Maybe some people live in hell on Earth... maybe it’s what we call individual choice.

Doesn’t bother me what you believe. It bothers me you deny children the right to express themselves devoid of science.

They hope to save people from that outcome - annoying to those who, like yourself, feel that their concept is flawed ... alienating maybe to those who have zero belief whatsoever?

What about a child who rejects lbgtq in the womb?

What if you could communicate with a fetus?

Would that be evidence God knew us before we were in the womb? What would that evidence “look” like? If there was factual evidence God exists, what then?

So, you need to call them names, call me names, stereotype them into dbag, etc as a way to convince me of your idea of an alternative to Christian values?

Off topic? 

When was there a topic to begin with?

You hate Christians, they don’t hate you.

You called them KKk without evidence... and someone else associated them with WBC, which their doctrine is much much different.

Shock and awe is a way, and it got results!!!

"1. Hell is a fiction created to scare people into buying into a religious belief.
2. Fetuses are not children, and trying to prove a negative is not possible. It is the same reasoning that a lot of Evangelicals depend on when their faith is challenged. You can’t prove God doesn’t exist because whatever new science is discovered, God is apparently “beyond” it. Yet there is literally no evidence of any god actually existing.
3. I’m not mocking these Evangelicals for their belief that abortion is wrong, I am mocking them for using fear tactics to try to force their beliefs upon others. Learn the difference.
4. The simple fact is that an abortion IS a woman’s right, and the fetus has no rights. God does not ordain rights to man, man does that within the societies that man forms. 
5. For your message being that all people express themselves as long as it is not cognitive dissonance, you’re posts sure have been loaded with cognitive dissonance.
6. You’re pretty much the only person on this thread that has made mention of you not being God, nor science being God, etc., which implies you think I, or someone else in this thread, do. There has been literally nothing to suggest that anyone in this thread believes that.
7. If people who are zealot speak in such a hateful way as these Evangelicals have, they are more likely to cause consequences with actual effect in the lives of others. You’re the one who brought up LGBTQ being a mental illness (it isn’t) but members of that community do have a high suicide rate largely due to the constant negativity and hate they get from groups like these Evangelicals.
8. I have not claimed that the Evangelical bags of douche cannot, nor should they lose the right to, protest like they did. I  stated that they are douche bags who spent some days ruining family activities and disrupting business for downtown Grants Pass, and that they should not have done that. Not that they should not have been allowed to do that, but that they themselves should not have done that. Learn the difference turbo.
9. Your argument isn’t logos (the appeal to logic), it is pathos (the appeal to emotion) trying to play itself off as logos by using he judaeo-christian theological definition of the word.
10. It literally takes no faith to believe that there is no God or gods. It takes an objective view of reality. There are hundreds of religious sects, tens of thousands if you include all the religions that have come and gone, and nearly all of them claim that they are the one true religion. They cannot all be right, and the odds that you chose or were raised to believe the one true religion are incredibly small. The simple fact is there are thousands of gods you don’t believe in.

"We agree, I just know you are wrong about God.

You prefer evidence. Hell is real. Whether you like to call it lack of evidence or lack of a confirmation, you haven’t proven your point that unborn children should not have rights or that you saying hate on one side is justified, or that abortion is a woman’s right by mocking people who see faith through testimony or by manifesting their faith in fruit of the Spirit.

All I am saying is that my message is for all people to express themselves whatever way they want, as long as it is not cognitive dissonance.

I don’t agree with everything these Zealots preach but I will fight to the end for their rights.

I will also pray for you, I don’t hate you whatsoever, sin is sin to a sinner.

I’m not God neither is science and no Logos is the mockery of faith in an attempt to inflame tensions that don’t exist.

If the people who are the zealots speak for a minority, why fear that their message is hateful or spiteful when it uses references from public resources?

I guess some rights are ok, but when it makes people feel uncomfortable, the world should stop to make concessions for your feelings and unjust faithless fear of the ‘damage’ done by showing the realities of abortion.

Tis just rejection of Logos. No government can replace God, and the individual must decide for themselves what their faith is in.

The fact of the matter is that threatening people with Hell, and death, don’t forget Evangelicals claimed people of that persuasion would die, is still a fear tactic.

To answer your second question, that is also a no. If a child asks me if Hell exists then I tell them that there is literally no evidence of it.
