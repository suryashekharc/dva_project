"3 is borderline and 5 is way too many, especially if you’re driving from SF. If you want to enjoy yourself I’d suggest an AM slot, nice lunch/town visit and maybe 1-2 in the afternoon. Maybe start your morning at domaine Carneros for sparkling tasting, drive up for lunch in Yountville (try mustards/Brix or go check out RH Kitchen) take your pic of a producer and then drive back via Silverado trail and any one of the vineyards there. Grab dinner in down to Napa (Compline, Cole’s for steak, Don Giovanni for Italian) and head back to the city from there.",t2_16l00w0r,_blinker_fluid,0,1647925785.0,0,t1_i1mkt7v,i1mkt7v,True,farakinsss,t3_tjj0id,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/tjj0id/napa_valley_itinerary/,Napa Valley Itinerary?,/r/napavalley/comments/tjj0id/napa_valley_itinerary/i1mkt7v/,3,r/napavalley,0,3
"Honestly if you don't know much about wine and just want to have a good time, I would suggest going to Domaine Carneros & The Castle. The maximum amount of wineries one can visit a day tops out at 3. Its REALLY hard to do four, and if you're trying to enjoy yourself and not run around like a chicken with your head cut off, just plan for two wineries and a nice lunch in Yountville in-between tastings.   


Start in Carneros with Domaine Carneros, have lunch in Napa or Yountville, then hit the Castle (Castello Di Amorosa). This will be a relaxed and enjoyable day of tastings, mixed with a scenic drive up valley and you wont be rushed and/or black out on your 3rd tasting of the day because you drank too much and couldn't fit lunch into your schedule. Both wineries are extremely tourist friendly and offer good experiences for your first time in Napa. Us locals tend to rip on these wineries but honestly if its your first time here, they're both cheap, enjoyable, and the most photo friendly wineries in Napa.  You're not going to get a world class experience but you will be able to chill out and drink some decent wines. 

&#x200B;

Just to qualify my experience: I work as the Portfolio Ambassador for a 6 brand (winery) company here in Napa. I worked in a tasting room for about a year when I first moved here for our top brand.

Insider Tips:  


1) As stated below: Dont call i San Fran or SF, just say ""the city.""

2) Just be chill. Some people feel they have to act like super boujee while they're in Napa. Don't be that guy. 

3) WHAT EVER YOU DO, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU EVER WEAR A WIDE BRIM HAT! Leave the Coachella hat and the cowboy boots at home!  As soon as tasting room staff see that they basically peg you as ""millennial instagram hoe who's not going to buy anything and just be annoying.""

4) Eat Breakfast and Don't skip lunch. People get DUI's EVERY FUCKING DAY. 

5) MAKE RESERVATIONS FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO. Even in April, shit gets booked up quick.

6) Most tasting room staff work off commission. That being said, you don't have to buy anything, and don't feel pressured to (even though some people are fucking used car salesmen), but leaving a tip is very appreciated. 

7) Just have a good time. Like 70% of people in Napa at any given time are here for their first time. Just be chill, humble, and honest and you will have a great time.",t2_ibvnov29,Wine_Zilla,0,1647925678.0,0,t1_i1mknnl,i1mknnl,True,farakinsss,t3_tjj0id,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/tjj0id/napa_valley_itinerary/,Napa Valley Itinerary?,/r/napavalley/comments/tjj0id/napa_valley_itinerary/i1mknnl/,2,r/napavalley,0,2

"If you can, try to get down valley as well for a well-rounded culinary experience. Here’s personal recommendations, while keeping the most pricey out of the mix..I have more favorites in those categories. 

Italian: South of Yountville is Bistro Don Giovanni, wonderful atmosphere and food. Napa-Oenetri, all their dishes are amazing. Calistoga-Amaro Italian Kitchen but I’ve never been there. 

American: Calistoga -Solbar. St Helena-Market (I’d go there Friday night after work, great people and food). Yountville-Ad Hoc. 
Napa-Coles Chop House, also amazing, and I almost forgot Grace’s Kitchen! Amazing food very casual atmosphere. 

Japanese..the only ones I know are in Napa..
Hal Yamashita is great, and Morimoto is awesome (but super expensive). I’d skip Eiko but that’s just my personal preference. 

Spanish: Napa - Zuzu. And La Taberna

Mexican/Latin: Napa - Las Palmas. It’s a small, intimate restaurant that we locals love, hidden away from the crowds. The food..beyond amazing and the atmosphere is casual and just..happy people, happy tummies. 

Also you can choose to dress up, or not in the places I’ve mentioned. You will see all kinds of dress once you’re out and about, and it’s all ok.",t2_48ywfs1o,lechitahamandcheese,0,1647837081.0,0,t1_i1hs63i,i1hs63i,False,Stefysteph1,t3_tj1wqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/tj1wqy/spring_vacation_in_calistoga_in_april/,Spring Vacation in Calistoga in April,/r/napavalley/comments/tj1wqy/spring_vacation_in_calistoga_in_april/i1hs63i/,2,r/napavalley,0,2

- also in Calistoga, I can't recommend Tank Winery enough! It's a very cool non-vineyard experience
- my husband and I spent a delicious anniversary at the bar at Bouchon Bistro, also in Yountville, also a Thomas Keller restaurant and it didn't break the bank 
- kayaking this time of year will be VERY cold, consider a wet suit and watch the wind, if it's windy you won't find many rental options open 
- other winery experiences worth while: Del Dotto (barrel tasting), Robert Mondavi (facility tour - it's a large operation there!), Mumm has a great patio and views (also breaks up all the reds with some sparkly) pro tip: plot wineries accordingly, the region is large

"You’re unlikely to find a tour without tasting, honestly. That’s not really how Napa functions lol

I don’t know how much it costs, but if Opus One is open and doing tours, you only get two pours of wine and the tour was about an hour long. Expect it to be pricy, though. 

You could also reach out to a winery you’re interested in and just ask them what they can do to accommodate! Nickel and nickel, chappellet, and quintessa all have gorgeous grounds and the tours I got were all great and informative.

"For a weekend you could accomplish your goals in Napa pretty easily. I’d suggest staying at the Westin but I’m biased as I’m an old Starwood fanboy. Otherwise, Archer, Andaz etc will put you literally in the middle of town. You can walk to several tasting rooms and have a variety of places to eat, as well as Oxbow market. I highly suggest you start one day with a drive to Yountville or St Helena for breakfast, and then work your way back for some true vineyard experiences. If you stay in the tasting rooms in any town you’ll miss out on some wonderful experiences. If Napa, for dining that’s walking distance I suggest Torc, Compline, Celadon and Gran Electrica.

"You’re right.  Fascinating how megacorp wineries have the resources to fight over such nonsense.  

From a quick Google search:

“Its Victory Started a String of Legal Battles.

 It went all the way to the California Supreme Court in 1986, which decided that both wineries had a right to use the name. To help differentiate between the two, Stag's Leap would use the apostrophe before the S, and Stags' Leap would use the apostrophe after the S.“

In any event, I would recommend staying away from both corporations; whether it’s a tobacco conglomerate or multinational food and beverage conglomerate, both are siphoning profits from the community and driving up costs.

"January/February is the best time to visit – no crowds,people are happy to see you, cooler weather and land is greening. 

With the caveat that my wine pallette is not the most refined in the world, here are some of my long term favorites.  

However, I would also recommend researchingand visiting one of the smaller by appt only/no tasting room places to see whatyou can find.Smaller tasting rooms

Rombauer - [https://rombauer.com/](https://rombauer.com/)\- Chards, Zins, Merlot, Cabs

Small tasting room, relaxed experience, $20, great value! One of our favorite places to visit because they are more about sharing wine with you rather than selling you wine or making.  Bottles range from $40-$125, with averagearound $65.  Classic oaky Chard, several different vineyards several really tasty Zins and Merlots.  Our absolute fav place.

Frank family - [https://www.frankfamilyvineyards.com/](https://www.frankfamilyvineyards.com/)\- Chards, Sparkling, Pinot, Zin, Merlot, Pettit Syrah, Cabs

A little larger tasting experience – Three levels of tastingfrom $50-$70, (basically current releases, then current + Estate, then WinstonHill Cabs) Bottles range from $38-$275, with median around $75.  Good quality across all wines.

Antica - [https://www.anticanapavalley.com](https://www.anticanapavalley.com)– cabs, chards, a Pinot and a dessert wine.Out in a valley with truly amazing views. Twisty drive ifyou get car sick.  Tasting has gotten pricey at $75, but I think they still include light food with that. Good wines across the board.  Bottles range from $35 to $250.

Corison - [https://www.corison.com](https://www.corison.com)– Cabs! Cabs! Cabs! (and a Gewürztraminer )

Three tastings Library $75, Collector’s vertical – Cabs1999-2018 $150 and a Kronos vertical at $150. I have only done the library. Good experience and great wine, bottles range from $100-$425.

Larger Places

Hall - [https://www.hallwines.com](https://www.hallwines.com)– two tasting rooms – winery (Rutherford) and valley – St. Helena. Rutherford is pretty, St. Helena more casual. $50 Art of Cab tasting or move up to Ultimate Cab Experience at $100.  They also have a Platinum experience at $200,but I haven’t done it. 

Bottles range from $35 to $580, with really good valuesin the $50-$75 range.  If you have themoney, the ultimate Cab tasting has some really good wines.Corison and Hall are both really good cabs.

Domaine Chandon - [https://www.chandon.com/](https://www.chandon.com/)\- sparkling and still wines (but we mainly do the sparkling)

A confusing set of tasting options – I think the $50 one is the normal experience. Make sure they feed you the Mt. Veeder and Yountville Bruts for something unique.  Etoile are alsovery good.  Sparkling bottles range from$25 to $90.  

Insider tip – since you will be there during a non-crowded time, if you time your visit toward the end ofthat day, they may share whatever sparkling wine is open because they can’tkeep it overnite. Have fun!",t2_p5ulf,BeakersBro,0,1637157816.0,0,t1_hkzl379,hkzl379,False,SplittenKittens,t3_qunwub,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/qunwub/late_january_first_time_visit_to_napa_valley/,Late January First Time Visit to Napa Valley,/r/napavalley/comments/qunwub/late_january_first_time_visit_to_napa_valley/hkzl379/,1,r/napavalley,0,1

"Healdsburg has so many great spots. Personally Bravas is where I take friends and family if it’s their first time eating in Healdsburg but any of the below you won’t regret.

* Bravas for amazing tapas in a fun backyard feel
* Valette for an elevated and delicious multi-course dinner
* Barndiva has a delicious brunch
* Campo Fina for great Italian food and wood fired pizzas
* Guisano for delicious Salvadoran food, super unique.

Haven’t spent too much time in eating in Sebastopol but…

* Ramen Gaijin is supposedly the best Ramen in the bay
* Blue Ridge is pricey but great quality local eats
* If you’re into wine REGION is a super cool concept where you can drink tons of local wines and they’ll do carry out from most of the local restaurants.

Hope that helps! Enjoy your time.

"More likely it will squeeze out the smaller wineries that can't afford to lose a lot of fruit each year, and don't buy in large enough quantities to get pricing power.  The big producers will be able to diversify the fire risk by owning multiple plots and buy from private growers.  Higher costs in crop protection, insurance, etc. will be passed on to consumers. Napa prices will outpace inflation. A good $50 cab will become $75.  

The small family-owned wineries add an irreplaceable charm to the valley IMO, but even if they disappear the market for great overpriced wine will remain.",t2_11j57i,JimmyGaroppoLOL,0,1631122714.0,0,t1_hc30o6a,hc30o6a,False,greenwizard,t3_oqxgds,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/oqxgds/scorched_parched_and_now_uninsurable_climate/,"Scorched, Parched and Now Uninsurable: Climate Change Hits Wine Country",/r/napavalley/comments/oqxgds/scorched_parched_and_now_uninsurable_climate/hc30o6a/,1,r/napavalley,0,1

Also don’t forget to go to Yountville to experience their restaurants too.. and most importantly plan to get in the line at Bouchon Bakery and get you some of their amazing HoHo’s (well they’re not called HoHo’s but you get my drift).

The ski regions have been canceling hotel rooms, as those are explicitly banned for out of town travelers unless for essential business. I imagine this will also be the case in Napa. 

I have reservations at wineries for clients around NYE, but the wineries have all basically said “we’ll keep you on the books, until we are forced to shut down”... no one expects for us to actually be open by then. Might be worth a call to your airline, and see if they’d push the trip until at least March. I’d put up a good sum of money to bet we fall into the order in the next two days.

"Hit up Conn Valley. Excellent wine, and often the wine maker himself will conduct the tasting. A much more intimate and personal experience.

I've done the Spire collection tasting ( La Jota ), and while La Jota is my favorite Napa cab, the tasting left a lot to be desired. 

Also, the best place to eat in Napa is culinary institute. So much bang for your buck, and they often have killer wines available. Last time I went they were doing a 90s cult cab by the glass. Caymus, Dunn, Cardinal, so much stuff from mid 90s. It was excellent!

One more recommendation is Far Niente. Really is a beautiful tasting experience and personal. A little pricey but we all felt it was worth it.

"Been drinking Napa cab for many years and have had many of the cult wines, Bond, Bryant Family, Harlan and Old Dunn. But La Jota is my favorite. It is such an outstanding wine! Barely approachable when young due to the grippy tannin, but boy when those wines have a decade or two.

My recommendation is find a mid 90s La Jota; they are not that expensive ($150) relatively speaking.

"Switch Opus for Silver Oak (2 miles away). I would recommend Chateau Boswell as well, but they just burned down. Alpha Omega is a great option for a late tasting- Great for sunset drinking. 

In Yountville, Handwritten had a very nice tasting and so did Restoration Hardware. Perry Lang’s has the best steak in the area. Press is also good, but Perry was better. Their menu is currently stripped down, but should be back my March. 

If you need to do a tasting with food due to time go to Del Dotto Piazza and do the cave tasting. They serve home made pizza that is amazing and the best tater tots I’ve ever had. I’m not a Pinot Noir lover- I also prefer Napa cabs, but their Pinot is for cab lovers.

"Fair warning that it's expensive as heck to live in Napa, and pretty much everywhere out here. There's also not a ton to do in Napa proper but eat and drink booze, no matter what your age. Also be aware that the entire hospitality industry is... a little hurting right now, we'll say, and that includes wineries, bars, and restaurants.

Gorgeous place though, if you like scenic walks/hikes wth great views, and the weather is generally great for it. And, if you have transportation, you can generally get to some of the best basically-anything-you-want somewhere in the bay area, whether it's entertainment, clubs, shopping, any food you care for, whatever. 

Being a transplant from the Eastern US myself, I can tell you that California life is... a bit different than VA, though, it may take some getting used to--but once you get the hang of it, you may not want to go back ;)

Napa Valley College is a generally a good little school, at least in my experience. The viticulture and oenology program is a pretty competitive one and the field overall is quite competitive out here too, though, so do your research and be at least somewhat sure that your interest is really in that direction. You can do what I did after graduating and transfer over to a UC school afterwards if you want a bachelor's degree. UC Davis is nearby and well known for its agricultural programs, including viticulture and oenology, food science, and a master brewer's (beer) program. 

Can't tell you too much about Santa Rosa except it's fairly similar, only slightly more coastal, and occasionally catches horribly on fire. Napa (city of) is a little more protected, though not by much.

The weather is beautiful most of the year. There is the normal number of people your age and lots of outside activities as it is both near the ocean and the mountains. Finding reasonable housing the worst problem. There is both a shortage of rentals and the cost is really high. When you work you are paid more than in other parts of the country and that makes up for it but as a student not working the rent cost will feel really high.

"After a fashion. Early in the Cold War, some government group another was trying to create intelligent and maneuverable reconnaissance and sabotage units to use against Russia. They bioengineered wings onto a simian base and tried training the things. Unfortunately, funding was cut shortly after, and with environmental regulations being practically non-existent at the time, they just released them into the wild. 

Since then, there's been a small but thriving colony of the ""Rebobs"" on the western side of the valley. Every so often, one or two manage to wander into the Vaca mountains, so I wouldn't be too surprised, necessarily, if a breeding pair made it over to Hennessy. But like I said, it's still a little early in the year for hatchlings. Maybe you made a lucky sighting!

In all seriousness though: Since you have to have to pre-pay when you make the reservation, selling your reservation and recouping your cost if your plans change is a lot better than forfeiting the money.  We planned the trip to Napa last minute, so I'm just putting this out there in case someone ends up deciding they want to sell their reservation.",t2_4tc38fd3,FrenchLaundromat,0,1571338688.0,0,t1_f435pi4,f435pi4,False,FrenchLaundromat,t3_dj1rlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/dj1rlf/wanted_french_laundry_reservations_for_2_oct_24th/,Wanted - French Laundry Reservations for 2 - Oct 24th -27th,/r/napavalley/comments/dj1rlf/wanted_french_laundry_reservations_for_2_oct_24th/f435pi4/,1,r/napavalley,0,1

For restaurants some of my favorites are Farmstead, Gotts Roadside, Brix, Fumè, and Calistoga Inn.

"Hi there! I have been working in tasting rooms in Napa for 9 years and this is what I would advise:

For a group that size you would need to call ahead to the wineries you want to visit to schedule a large group tasting, even to some of the larger, more tourist driven wineries. Especially if you're looking at wanting to do this on a weekend this time of year. Most wineries are happy to host groups that size as long as they have the time to prepare and setup for them and/or have the time/space available to accommodate. 

If you show up to a tasting room with a group that size, and with no prior communication about that group, on a busy Saturday you will most likely be turned away or will need to be split up into smaller groups to be better accommodated if a tasting room does have the space.

Food is a whole different ballgame. Very, very few wineries have a permit that allows guests to bring outside food onto their properties, especially for a group that size. It would probably be better to look for a restaurant to have lunch at and, again, you would need to call ahead to make a reservation. 

I hope that helps! If you have any more questions feel free to toss them at me.

Bouchon or Bistro Jeanty in Yountville are good. If you are in St Helena, maybe Market or Goose & Gander (but upstairs only.)  Brasswood is fairly quiet. In Calistoga you can try Lovina, Solbar (a bit upscale) and if you like a nice outdoor environment and really good food Sam's Social Club.

"It’s super overwhelming! I live here, and I still have so many wineries, etc on my list that I haven’t visited. One of the things that I recommend to anyone that is visiting, is to make an appointment at a winery that is far up valley. Think Schramsberg, Spring Mountain, Stony Hill. That way you can drive north and see all the beauty the valley has to offer. On your way, stop at either Bouchon Bakery or Model Bakery for coffee and pastries. Then on your way back, have a simple lunch at Gott’s Roadside. Go back to your hotel, take a nap or go by the pool and then get ready to go to dinner.

**Teed Rockwell**

Although Teed Rockwell began his philosophical studies with a strong interest in Continental philosophy, especially Heidegger, Nietzsche, and Hegel, he now studies how philosophical presuppositions about mind and reality affect the practices of scientific researchers, especially in biology, psychology and the cognitive sciences. Much to his own surprise, he has become a philosopher of science in the Anglo-American Analytic tradition. He sees the American pragmatists, especially John Dewey, as the root that connects these two allegedly conflicting traditions. His MIT Press Book Neither Brain nor Ghost (2005) rejects both dualism and the mind/brain identity theory, and argues that the mind is a “behavioral field” that fluctuates within the brain/body/world nexus. 

**Caitlin Cornwall** 

Caitlin Cornwall is a biologist who leads planning and partnerships at Sonoma Ecology Center. A longtime Sonoma County resident, she is the lead author of Sonoma County’s climate vulnerability assessment and the *Climate Resilience Roadmap for Sonoma County*. Since the 2017 North Bay fires, she has led hundreds of people on “fire recovery walks” in burned areas.

Krista Fatka is an Oakland based stand up comic and writer. She started her career in entertainment as a trapeze artist and at the decrepit old age of 28 decided to hang up the leotard for good. Since then she’s honed her naturally sarcastic and gregarious personality into an award-winning comedic persona. She’s the winner of the 2017 Sacramento comedy competition and a finalist in The San Francisco International Comedy Competition.

"Hi,

I was the original luncheon chef at Auberge du Soleil way back in 1982! It is a beautiful place to propose to your g/f.   I suggest that you call the restaurant's management team well in advance and let them help you  plan something special. I don't think you'll need to go somewhere else to propose. 

If you wait till the next day to propose, you can do that at a winery. Joseph Phelps Vineyards has a spectacular view and their hospitality staff will also help you set something up that will definitely be memorable.

"Uber will be the least hassle, but you're going to pay for it.  If there's 4 of you with luggage you'll be almost certainly in UberXL territory, and the quote for that is in the $168 territory (https://www.uber.com/fare-estimate/).  Split 4 ways it's not bad.

The Evans airport bus will work and be cost effective, but the timing of catching the bus is an issue and you still have the extra bit of travel from the Evans depot to Silverado, so you're back at Uber.

Public transportation would be a total nightmare.  Possible, but not pleasant and will...again...require Uber.

Another option would be a one-way car rental.  Enterprise is generally the cheapest option.  Four people w/ luggage in an intermediate car will be $120 + $6 bridge tolls.  After you drop the car off in Napa, they will drive you to your final destination.  If you're all paying from the same pot of money this will be the most cost effective option, and almost the least hassle.

"I have a few recommendations.  
  
Sterling Vineyards in Calistoga. It's [up on a hill](https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipMGlKwlSXdIHjzDaDoB57VI65sPu6aQ1PCHKRzC=s1024) in the middle of the valley and has a ski lift that takes you up to the winery from the parking lot. It has a self-guided tour and tasting room, but the best feature is [their terraces](https://lh3.ggpht.com/p/AF1QipOsgDmnTiv_e3ikphJQZfBqJwFyE9G6EIT62tUB=s1024) which provide an amazing view of the valley.  
  
Across the road from Sterling is [Castello di Amorosa](https://castellodiamorosa.com/). It's an authentic castle built by Dario Sattui for $100M. It includes all features you'd expect to see from a castle including draw bridge, dungeon, watch tower, chapel, courtyard etc. He imported 30K bricks from Europe to build it.  
  
[Chateau Montelena](https://montelena.com/) is another popular place for proposals in Calistoga. Mainly for their [lake with pagodas](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4_4-FBtIXH4/U0yKdoaW0JI/AAAAAAAACw0/TJVWqcJsZEU/s1600/Chateau+Montelena+pagoda+c+1.jpg).  
  
Another option that might be good is [Quintessa](https://www.quintessa.com/) in St Helena. They have [private pavilions](https://www.google.com/search?q=quintessa+pavilion&client=firefox-b-1&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiv5bDr1vbeAhUmr1QKHfQNB6cQsAR6BAgFEAE&biw=1920&bih=976#imgrc=_) that overlook the vineyards and a lake. Depending on weather, the glass walls can be opened completely or closed so the interior can be heated. You can walk around the pavilions on Google street view. A nice private option that's safe for bad weather, but also probably the most expensive.  
  
Wherever you go, make sure you call ahead of time and let the winery know you plan to propose so they can make special arrangements for you. :) Good luck!",t2_3lj9d,damontoo,0,1543394382.0,0,t1_eamnbae,eamnbae,True,Gravy00x13,t3_a10emo,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/a10emo/winery_for_january_proposal/,Winery for January Proposal,/r/napavalley/comments/a10emo/winery_for_january_proposal/eamnbae/,2,r/napavalley,0,2
"Artesa and Auberge are both excellent recommendations. I'm always telling people to go to Mont La Salle, a Christian Brothers monastery. It has been one of my favorite places in the valley since I was a kid. Off the beaten path in North Napa with beautiful grounds and gardens and a chapel with the most amazing acoustics I've ever had the privilege of hearing or singing in. I don't know if they still do it but many years ago you could attend service and hear the monks chant and sing. It's breath taking if you're into that sort of thing. They have spaces inside and outside for events, catering and wine tasting as well for small or large groups.

"Tasting room employee here! It will probably depend on what wineries you would like to visit. I worked at a large, very tourist driven winery for several years and the time between Christmas and New Years was always quite busy for us. When I worked at smaller, lesser known wineries it was hit or miss depending on weather.

With Christmas Eve/Christmas Day falling on a Monday/Tuesday combo the weekdays may not be as crazy since plenty of people will have to work, but the weekend before and after will probably be very hectic.

My best recommendation would be to plan out your visit and select what wineries you'd like to see in advanced. Also, make sure to check if they require an appointment for tasting. I currently work at an appointment only tasting room and if we're fully booked up we are unable to accept any guests who walk in/call in to make day of appointments.

"I live in Calistoga and I'm not aware of any alternatives. Mud baths are clothing optional (or required) but require appointments and aren't social spaces. Some spas in town offer couple's mud baths that have two baths side by side. [Golden Haven](http://www.goldenhaven.com/) is one. They have mud baths and then a Jacuzzi after, which I assume is also clothing optional. I never did a mud bath there but I've stayed there and used the pool. It's a little odd in that it's an older motel that was renovated to be more modern, but the renovation isn't completely convincing. Same feeling goes for the [Calistoga Motor Lodge.](https://www.calistogamotorlodgeandspa.com/) The motor lodge is right on the main strip so there's traffic noise. Golden Haven is in a residential neighborhood and quiet.   
  
You might also consider a Jacuzzi room at a hotel or an airbnb with a hot tub/pool. Just ask the hosts if it can be clothing optional.  
  
[Solage](https://solage.aubergeresorts.com/) is the highest end hotel in the city limits and has clothing optional areas including hot tub/sauna but I'm not sure if it's co-ed.  
  
If you can sacrifice clothing optional I highly recommend [Indian Springs.](https://www.indianspringscalistoga.com/) Their grounds are beautiful and they easily have the best pool in the county. It's Olympic sized and heated to hot tub temperatures by large geothermal pipes. They also have a spa with mud/mineral baths including couples baths.

"There is no place like French Laundry. If budget is of no concern, it’s unbeatable. But I don’t think it’s worth the price for just anybody. If not every member of your party is ready to embrace the experience, it’s not worth the price imo. There’s no better way to ruin an evening than for someone to regret their spending, especially if they leave hungry, which is a possibility after French Laundry. 

In Yountville, any of Keller’s places will be a home run. I’m partial to Bouchon, but Ad Hoc is also great. Lucy is also very nice. 

My favorite in restaurant in the valley is Goose and Gander. It’s not inexpensive, but not outrageous. Elevated, eclectic, approachable food. Awesome bar. And they’ve got an unbelievable wine list. It’s worth going just for the wine list, really. Farmstead and Market are also great if in St Helena. 

All the restaurants at the Auberge du Soleil resorts are great. Sam’s Social Club and Lovina in Calistoga are wonderful and kind of off the beaten path. 

I can’t make a fine dining recommendation in Napa, because I’ve literally always eaten at Oxbow Market when I’ve been there. There’s some super elevated food there as well, especially relative to the setting. 

Valette in Healdsburg is really nice if you’re on the Sonoma side. Guiso is also great.

"Do you mean the city of Sonoma (and Glen Ellen) area or all of Sonoma County (which , as the other user pointed out, is quite broad)?

In Sonoma, Glen Ellen, Kenwood area you have loads of great options. Kunde in Kenwood is great. Sky Vineyards in Glen Ellen or Sixteen 600 in Sonoma are off the charts. 

Wine County Chocolates is a tiny treat but phenomenal chocolate shop (wine truffles are interesting, but their coffee truffle is my favorite) with a shop in Sonoma and Glen Ellen. 

Hendry in Napa is a great tour and great wine. As is Frog’s Leap. 

I suggest starting the day in Sonoma at Gundlach Bundschu (beautiful walking trails too) and brunch at the Fremont Dinner. Then the Sonoma Plaza and Wine Country Chocolates. Then through Glen Ellen for charm and picnic supplies or a nice lunch. Then to Kenwood for Kunde winery (huge wine cave is a delight in the hot summer). Then over Trinity Road (beautiful drive through the fire worn mountains - Mr. Veeder Appalachian) to Oakmont and Yountville where you’ll find Frog’s Leap or Napa for Hendry (reservations for tastings or tour for either). While in Yountville try for Bouchon treats or dinner at any of the amazing restaurants (Redd or Ad Hoc would be top picks withough breaking the bank like French Laundry would).

"“Sonoma” is a big area. I like upper Dry Creek Valley as it’s about as off the beaten path as you can get imo. If you’re up there, Trattore is really cool and they’re doing some interesting blends. Dutcher Crossing is right up the road from there, but on the valley floor while Trattore is up on a hilltop. Very interesting contrast, so it’s pretty cool to do both. Dry Creek General Store (if their neighbor hasn’t finally succeeded in shutting them down) is a great place to load a picnic basket. Geyserville is also just over the hill from there and Diavola is a fantastic restaurant there that is worth the trip. I’d drive to Geyserville even from Napa Valley just for Diavola. Ferrari Carano is also right there. I wouldn’t really go there for the wine as much as I would just to see the place. It’s impressive. Yoakim Bridge and Truett Hurst are also up there and pretty nice. Bella is very cool. Between Healdsburg and Lake Sonoma you really can’t go wrong. Pack your picnic basket, fill it at Dry Creek General Store, hit a winery, taste, grab a bottle, picnic and wine up at Lake Sonoma, hit another winery or two, dinner in Geyserville or Healdsburg. Boom. 

You can’t go wrong if you just go to Healdsburg and spend the day there either.

As the other posters have said, the night life in downtown Napa is much more active then anywhere else up Valley so it all depends on what you want out of your trip.

As for wineries, i would recommend Laura Michael Wines, Brian Arden, Summers, Ballantine, Tank (all smaller, boutique). If you can get a reservation Cakebread is fantastic.

"Napa has cool restaurants and shopping, but is pretty commercial. Yountville is pretty awesome from a food and wine perspective, but super spendy and a bit up it’s own ass imo.

"Downtown Napa maybe has a bit more of a night life than St. Helena or Calistoga. So stay there if that's your thing (the Archer Hotel opened up their skybar on the roof and it was a lot of fun and there are other bars and stuff). Smaller boutique wineries will either have smaller tasting groups, or even private in some cases (like Sinegal in St. Helena) but you MUST book reservations ahead of time. Larger wineries you have more flexibility to come and go, as they have tasting rooms with open seating if you want to skip the tour and just drink. Castello di Amorosa has shit wine but a fun tour. V. Sattui has shit wine but great picnic grounds.

For restaurants, for my 40th we had dinner at Kenzo in downtown Napa. It's owned by the same guy who owns Kenzo Winery. It'd liken it to French Laundry but with all Japanese food.

"Hey! There are so many hotels and B&B’s in the valley you’ll have a hard time choosing! Your best bet would be to look for a Napa Valley hotels website or any of the booking sites like Trip Advisor etc. They all cater to tourists, even the Meritage, that will have great pamphlets on wineries not to miss.  The Harvest Inn in St Helena is beautiful. The best reason to stay in St Helena is because it’s mid-valley and while you can’t escape all the traffic, you won’t have to travel through it from Napa. The city of Napa has a great downtown with shops and boutiques, many fantastic restaurants and wine tasting.  It’s not a big city, although a lot bigger than when I was growing up here in the 70’s, and I’m sure you won’t want to miss it.

"The ones Sammy suggested are the best, but ludicrously priced. I would advise against Meritage. That's a place you go on a business trip. It caters to business clients kind of.  
  
Stay in Calistoga at Indian Springs (preferred) or Calistoga Spa. Indian Springs is a very old resort that's held up well and has been remodeled. The grounds are beautiful with oversized hammocks hanging from palm trees, ping pong tables, tennis courts, Badminton, croquet, bocce ball, pool table, chess etc. They have indoor and outdoor lounge areas with fireplaces and an on-site spa that provides all imaginable spa services plus mud baths. But the main feature of this hotel is their pool. They have by far the best pool in the Napa Valley. It's Olympic sized and heated with geothermal from a spring on the property. Not just heated normally, it's like a hot tub. It's basically the largest hot tub you'll ever swim in. If it's too hot there's a newer cold pool as well. The hotel is also right at the end of the downtown strip so you can walk into town for everything you need. [Website.](https://www.indianspringscalistoga.com/)  
  
While you're here, I highly recommend you visit Chateau Montelena for their pond, Sterling Vineyard for the view, and/or Castello di Amorosa which is a legit castle that Dario Sattui built for $100M. He imported 300K bricks from Europe for the project.  
  
If you guys are fit, hiking the Oat Hill Mine trail provides exceptional views of the valley and is worth checking out. Trails on Mt. Saint Helena are still closed due to the fires.  
  
If you decide against my hotels, at least try to book something upvalley. The further north the more authentic the Napa valley experience will be. Avoid anything in Napa the city as it's just a big city with Walmart, fast food etc.

"Any hotel in Younteville I highly recommend. The little town is such a  lice of heaven with wonderful vineyards and top restaurants in the world in walking distance. Its also centrally located to get anywhere you need to in Napa. Its probably the most expensive area to stay at... but since its your anniversary go splurge! Hotel Younteville is my favorite.

"Anything in the north end of the valley will be great. In Calistoga I can recommend visiting Sterling Vineyards, Castello di Amorosa, and Chateau Montelena. Other nice towns are Saint Helena and Yountville. Napa the city is just a medium sized city with Walmart etc. Skip it for all the other places I'm the Napa valley. Though I'm sure some Napans will be in shortly to defend their city. :)  
  
Lodging in the Napa valley is expensive so book early. It helps if your stay is during the week. One of my favorite places to stay is Indian Springs in Calistoga. They have an Olympic sized pool that's naturally heated to hot tub temperatures by piping in water from a hot spring. It recently underwent a renovation so it's more expensive and crowded than it used to be.

"Wineries will offer free or low cost tastings. Think $0-$40 depending. Some of the more popular spots (like Hendry Winery tastings and tours or Frog's Leap tastings http://www.frogsleap.com/visit.php) l require reservations ahead of time. But there are literally hundreds of wineries that you can just walk into and get a few small glasses of wine for close to no cost. 

Around the City of Napa try Hendry, Hess Collection, and Artesa. There is good chow downtown: Ca Momi, Gott's (burgers), Azzuro (fancy-ish pizzas in a nice setting), Norman Rose (slightly fancier burgers with less of a wait), Basalt, and many more. 

Rutherford has St. Suprey, Frog's Leap, and many other great wineries. You'll probably stop at Dean & Deluca which makes Whole Foods seem budget friendly, but they have nice things for a day trip in Napa. 

Yountville has the fancy food you've heard about - Addendum for fancy fried chicken (order a half hour ahead on their website!) and is behind Ad Hoc which is a worthy dinner experience. Bouchon is usually worth the wait (there's often a line) and Bistro Jeanty is a great but rich restaurant. Redd or Reddwood are loved by locals too.

As you head up valley to Calistoga and St. Helena things get a bit pricier but remarkably beautiful. CIA is up here, but also some of the best views. Just drive out on Silverado Trail - it's maybe 5 minutes slower than Highway 29 but it's what you think of when you think about Napa. 

Maybe start with a hot air balloon ride if you can make an early start. Hit a few wineries in the city of Napa then head up to Yountville for lunch and more wineries. Walk around Yountville then go to Frog's Leap. Then up Silverado Trial to hit another couple wineries until you get to St. Helena where you'll walk downtown, maybe stay at the hot springs resorts or a nice Air BNB (look for something with a view). 

Next day return through Sonoma if you'd like to try the other side of the mountain. Through Glen Ellen where you could stop for more wine tastings, sandwiches at Glen Ellen Market if you're moving quickly, truffles at Wine Country Chocolates (say hi to Betty!), then walk the Sonoma Plaza and Sebastiani winery, maybe the old theater (say hi to Roger!) and some dessert before heading back from the north bay.",t2_4akln,serval,0,1496325667.0,0,t1_dibfaib,dibfaib,True,meowalexx,t3_6ek82a,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/6ek82a/napa_date/,Napa Date,/r/napavalley/comments/6ek82a/napa_date/dibfaib/,4,r/napavalley,0,4

"Kenzo (http://kenzonapa.com) is the newest addition to Napa Valley's fine dining scene - it's Traditional Japanese and does a prix fixe menu for $225/pp.  If that goes beyond your budget, consider Morimoto (as mentioned below) or even Miminashi which is a newer, more hip restaurant in downtown Napa specializing in Japanese cuisine with a few sushi/sashimi options. The ultimate favorite foodie hack is a Taco lunch at the French Laundry Gardens across the street from the restaurant in Yountville- not many people know there are tables and chairs in the gardens where the TFL team grow most of their produce and is open to the public.  My recommendation is to go to the Tacos Garcia truck (Washington street next to Stewart cellars in the Pancha's parking lot), grab a few tacos and a soda from Kelly's filling station across the way and then walk down .25 mile down the street to the garden.  It's my favorite Napa hack and it will cost you about $10/pp (bring cash for tacos).  Spend the day there in Yountville - there are a TON of tasting rooms up and down the way including the really fun JCB Tasting Room (see video I did on it: https://youtu.be/gBioRx8GH4I ) - you don't need a reservation and it's a total blast.",t2_twejk,sommvivant,0,1492640979.0,0,t1_dghmzsn,dghmzsn,False,totinospizzaftw,t3_64yid7,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/64yid7/trip_to_napa_in_may/,Trip to Napa in May,/r/napavalley/comments/64yid7/trip_to_napa_in_may/dghmzsn/,2,r/napavalley,0,2

"OK, so for hiking you have a few options.  If you're in Napa proper then check out Skyline park in the south part; lots of trails...anything from a short up & back to big loops with great views of the north bay.  If you're upvalley you can check out Bothe State Park.  Very wooded & nice with a few different trails.  Watch for ticks at this one, though, but it's still nice.

Napa is the red wine capital of the world (IMNSHO) so you've got all sorts of excellent options.  My personal favorite wineries are Dutch Henry (near Calistoga) and Baldacci but there are a ton of excellent options.  If you want a tour, Mondavi (although popular) has a good one, as does Cakebread.

Sushi is pretty straightforward: the best...perhaps the best outside of SF...is Morimoto.  I won't drone on about all the great things about it, but it's incredible, and incredibly expensive.  In Calistoga there's a place called Sushi Mambo which is not bad and not expensive.  Napa has another sushi place called Eiko's which I cannot recommend; if you go to Eiko's, you might as well go to Morimoto because Eiko's isn't much (if at all) of a bargain, and the quality isn't there.

Bookstores...there's the Napa Bookmine in downtown Napa.  It's both used & new and is generally my favorite.  North Napa and Calistoga both have branches of Copperfield's, which is a North Bay chain of bookstores & they're decent.

So there ya go.  Hope that helps.  Enjoy your stay and I hope it stops raining for you.

Sonoma has great soil for vines. It might be more in your price range and offers more cities close by. The Napa Valley is a bit isolated especially the upvalley communities. During the past season if one of the major highways was closed it would just be a nightmare on the other. Portions of the trail were closed due to a major slide outside st Helena. Not a lot of options with that and not a fun commute if you work outside the valley. ,t2_st0sc,Keokuk37,0,1491372359.0,0,t1_dfuoyao,dfuoyao,False,mill1ion,t3_5oo3gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/5oo3gb/acreage_homesteading_in_napa_county/,"Acreage, homesteading in Napa county?",/r/napavalley/comments/5oo3gb/acreage_homesteading_in_napa_county/dfuoyao/,2,r/napavalley,0,2

"Yes, start booking now! September is harvest here and the peak visitor season.

For hotels, it depends on what kind of atmosphere you want after your day out. Napa will offer the most to do at night, Yountville has more Michelin stars per capita than anywhere in the world but you'll just be eating and sleeping there. An AirBNB hidden away can be romantic but leaves some visitors wanting at the end of the day if it's too remote.

For a winery to propose at, I'd avoid any of the big names mentioned since they'll be packed with people in September. We have a wine tour company and help quite a few people plan their proposals each year. My biggest suggestion would be to hire someone like us to handle the driving and planning for you... there's lots of great companies to choose from. They'll be able to get you out of the crowds and into some great spots to propose.

That said, a great spot for the question is [Barnett Vineyards](https://www.barnettvineyards.com/). It's a bit more difficult to get to but worth it for the occasion. Here's a [picture](https://simplydrivennapasonoma.com/proposal/) we took of a couple just after their tour, tasting, private picnic and proposal on a deck overlooking Napa Valley.

Hotels are pretty much out right now unless you're looking to spend $500/night minimum for a basic ""two star"" (by European standards) hotel room.  

As another poster said, if you're comfortable with camping then look into Skyline park (the site appears to be [HERE](http://www.campcarneros.com/)).

There are lodgings in the nearby towns of Fairfield, American Canyon, and Vallejo that are slightly more reasonable, and in ""normal"" traffic the drive isn't terrible, but the whole parking/traffic situation when the show ends is a friggin' nightmare, so what would normally be a 20-30 minute drive would take twice as long if you're lucky.

BottleRock has ended up being a big cash cow for Napa and the surrounding towns, so hotels are the front line in price gouging.

"Here's a short description of the town I've been writing about:

It's a small, mostly-agricultural community, right on the (fictional?) rail line between Sacramento and San Francisco. The town is very small, and is mostly supported by the surrounding vineyard (owned by a single, extended family). However, it's close enough to the city to attract professionals, students, working families, and so on, so it also has things like a health food store, a bakery, and a (small) bed and breakfast, though you have to go to the big town about a half-hour away if you need to get your serious shopping done.

The story focuses on a single mom, trying to raise a set of triplets on her own. She's able to support them by starting up her own bakery, then living in the apartment over the store front. It's not perfect, but, especially after things normalize, they're able to squeak by.

If an Uber or competitor is between $80 to $120 then I think I can deal with that. On any normal day I would consider that a ridiculous option to take, however, it's not much to pay for peace of mind in this instance, and it's a lot cheaper than the engagement ring ;)

I'm not sure how much an Uber would cost, but I checked with Lyft (a competitor) and it said between $75-85. 

Another possibility would be hiring a private car from a limo company. My mom used to do that sometimes from Napa to SF and I believe that was around $120, I don't remember the company though. A company in Napa called [California Wine Tours](https://californiawinetours.com/index.php) offers private car services, but I'm not sure how much it costs.

"What kind of wine do you like?

If you like sparkling, there are two well known places here in Napa: Mumm Napa and Schramsberg.  Mumm has a patio as well as indoor seating with a great view over the napa valley floor.  It is a non-traditional tasting as that you sit at a table and a server brings you wine that you order by the glass or ""flight"" of multiple small pours.  It can be budget friendly depending on what you order.  They also do tours by appt.  Not sure the cost on a tour.

I have never been on a tasting at Schramsberg, but I have been to the winery a few times.  Appt. required, don't know pricing.

If you want to check out high end Rutherford wines, Round Pond has an amazing tasting paired with cheeses out on their deck which sits right smack in the middle of the valley, elevated a few stories up, so you have a 360 degree view of the napa valley.  That being said, you have to pay for this one.  If I recall, it is $50/ person.

For middle of the road wines, the Louis M. Martini tasting room is worth a visit.  Classic tasting room experience: served at a walk up bar in the tasting room, or if you are lucky and the weather is nice, there is outdoor seating.

Down closer to the City of Napa, Andretti winery is pretty cool.

"The Drive will take about an hour each way give or take with traffic to either Napa or Sonoma.  Sounds like you want to go wine tasting, so I'd recommend staying in the area as stopping at ""just one more winery"" is always tempting.  

Yes wineries are open on Sunday/Monday, and if you can make it, any weekday will be better than a weekend for crowd factor.  Sundays tend to be better than Saturdays as well.  

December is when things really start to slow down around here, I would say Jan./Feb. are the most quiet (once Tahoe has snow and weekend trippers from the bay area head to the mountains instead of wine country).

No reason that you can't do both Napa and Sonoma the cities of Napa and Sonoma are only about 30 mins from each other.  If you're going to check out sonoma, go to the downtown square, lots of great tasting rooms there, great food (girl and the fig, sunflower cafe) plus, if it is a nice day, you can sit and drink wine in the park (there is a special accommodation that eliminates open container laws).  

There are plenty of budget friendly places to taste in Napa, but I would caution you about turning your nose up simply based on price.  Some of the coolest tasting experiences in the valley cost a bit more but have something additional to offer.  For instance, Sterling up in Calistoga has a tram take you to the top of a mountain at the extreme north end of the valley once on top, they have a self guided tour with an amazing deck that has a view of the entire Napa valley.

"What kinds of wine do you like?  

If you like sparkling wines, Mumm Napa has a beautiful deck to sit on that overlooks some of the most pristine vineyards in the valley.  Also, if you don't want to go farther North than the town of Napa, Domaine Carneros is south of town on 121 between Napa and Sonoma.  A bonus of Domaine Carneros is that there is a fantastic lunch spot called the Boon Fly Cafe just down the road.  

If Red wine is your thing, you might consider Round Pond in Rutherford.  You'll want a reservation for their outdoor 2nd floor deck.  It sits right in the middle of the valley, surrounded by vineyards, and it is the only building of height in the area.  Another great view can be found at Sterling Vineyards up in Calistoga.  They have a tram that takes you up a mountain to the winery which sits perched at the north end of the valley and has a great viewing deck looking south onto the valley.  Tasting at sterling includes a self guided tour.

There are tons of great wineries around, the region is famous for a reason.  

The great part about coming to Napa is that you will have no problem seeing vineyards, they're everywhere, including right up to the edge of the highway.

Are you interested in a winery tour as well?  A tour generally takes you through the facility of a winery and shows you the wine making process.

"Napa...all of Napa (the city and the valley) is getting more expensive all the time, but since you have a time share a big chunk of that expense is taken care of already.

Fall is probably my favorite time because the colors in the vines start to change (closer to November), the weather is great, and the tourist numbers are lower than the summer.  Just driving the length of the valley and back is a cool way to spend a couple of hours.

If you're not big wine people then figure out what kind of wine you *do* like and then find the best winery for that particular type, and then arrange for a ""reserve tasting"" or something along those lines.  We could all spew out recommendations but they won't be any good unless we know what you like.  If you hate reds, sending you to Del Dotto would be a waste of time & money, for example.  A good way to figure out what you might like would be to hit up a quality tasting room to gauge what you like.  Vintner's Collective in downtown Napa has excellent wines from lots of different small wineries and can help arrange tastings across the valley.  Their building was hit badly by the earthquake but is under repair and they are open.

Another poster said that the city of Napa is ""just another city""...a description with which I would politely like to disagree.  Downtown Napa has outstanding restaurants, two excellent music venues (the Uptown and City Winery...but the schedule for both looks a bit anemic as of now), and loads of tasting rooms.  Is there a Wal Mart and a couple of Targets?  Yes...guilty as charged.  But they're not in the middle of where tourists are going.  And there IS a lot of construction going on downtown for the next 18 months.  But downtown Napa has a lot to offer if you happen to like things like food and music.  

Also, I would be cautious regarding spending time and money at Castello di Amoroso; I've been treated poorly there, and I have not personally met a single person who has said it was worth the time or money.  Yelp reviews seem to be fairly generous to the place, so perhaps I should pay a repeat visit, but it's low on the priority list for me.

Safari West is excellent (been a couple of times).  It's expensive but they keep improving the grounds & the experience.  Book EARLY.

Hiking opportunities are abundant; Skyline Park, Bothe, Oat Hill Mine Road, etc.

The Oxbow Market in downtown Napa is excellent.  A cool place to spend a couple of hours.  It's where the Farmer's Market is held twice a week.

Anyway, have a great time.  October is a wonderful time to visit (it's also the best time to visit SF, by the way...nobody tells you that, but that's when the weather in SF is best).",t2_7a59z,midgetlotterywinner,0,1430930695.0,0,t1_cr0dek2,cr0dek2,True,SCV_JARHEAD,t3_32htsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/napavalley/comments/32htsy/how_expensive_is_visiting_napa/,How expensive is visiting napa?,/r/napavalley/comments/32htsy/how_expensive_is_visiting_napa/cr0dek2/,1,r/napavalley,0,1

"Yes, San Francisco is close. If you haven't been, I would suggest it. 

Aside from that, the town of Calistoga, as mentioned above, is definitely worth visiting. I went to SF/Napa/Sonoma a few years back and none of the people I went with were super into wine, but some of the best times we had were at vineyards. I would check out 1-2 early on, and if you don't like it, then so be it, but you may enjoy it. One thing we did was a wine tour from Platypus. It was about $100, and they picked you up, and brought you to four different vineyards. Lunch was provided and there were drinks and snacks on the bus. 

I will also second going to Castello di Amorosa and Sterling. Really nice, and right near each other. Down Calistoga is a few nice restaurants, bars, coffee shops, etc. It is also really picturesque. 

All that said, I think the most important thing to do is rent a car. Driving around the area was one of the best parts about being there. We drove to Muir Woods to see the redwoods, drove to Sonoma to spend a night, drove to the Pacific Coast Highway for some great views, and so on.

>__Castello di Amorosa__ is a castle and a winery located near [Calistoga, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calistoga,_California). First opening its doors to the public in April 2007, the castle is the pet project of 4th generation vintner, Dario Sattui, who also owns and operates the [V. Sattui Winery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Sattui_Winery) named after his great-grandfather who originally established a winery in [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco) in 1885 after emigrating from [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy) to [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) .   

>The winery sits on property that was once part of an estate owned by [Edward Turner Bale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Turner_Bale).

"You're going to want to drive upvalley. Napa the city is just a typical city. WalMart, strip malls etc. There's things to do there but in my opinion upvalley has more character. Though I may be biased because I live up here.  
  
You can drive up to Calistoga from Napa in about 40 minutes. I highly recommend doing so because the drive itself is beautiful. Some of my favorite places do happen to be wineries but you don't have to be into wine to enjoy them. These are in Calistoga unless stated otherwise -  
  
[Castello di Amorosa.](http://www.castellodiamorosa.com/) This is a pretty legit castle that was built by Dario Sattui and opened in 2007. It includes 850K bricks imported from Europe. [Wikipedia has more.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castello_di_Amorosa) If you don't go inside you can go here for free and walk around the grounds and take pictures. I do it sometimes. They keep sheep in a pen that's also accessible. Admission for a tasting and castle access starts at $20. [Bonus video of castle grounds.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOZ2iI9SHpM)  
  
[Sterling Vineyards.](http://www.sterlingvineyards.com/) This is a winery located on a hill in the middle of the valley, directly across from the castle. It has a tram that you ride up and down the hill to access the winery and [the absolutely incredible deck views](http://wineily.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Sterling-Vineyards-Napa-CA.jpg). The sommelier's will tell you many people have paid for just the view and I totally believe it. Admission with tram and 5 pours starts at $25.  
  
[Chateau Montelena](http://www.montelena.com/) is also a great stop with free access to the grounds, which include [a large pond with pegoda islands and bridges.](http://i.imgur.com/VYf2obA.jpg) The ponds are also home to friendly ducks and a swan. The winery itself put the Napa Valley on the map as a wine destination when one of their wines won a famous Paris wine competition in 1976, becoming the basis for the 2008 film ""Bottle Shock"".  
  
[Old Faithful Geyser](http://www.oldfaithfulgeyser.com/) is a geothermal geyser that goes off about once every half hour. It's right next door to Chateau Montelena. It might be a bit boring depending on the type of people you are. [A B roll clip I shot of it errupting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ByqYVvrLwk) The place also includes a bunch of friendly pigmy goats to pet. But the last time I visited they weren't around so mileage may vary. It also includes a gift shop with lots of touristy crap so if you want napa valley branded items or postcards it's a decent stop.  
  
Oat Hill Mine Trail. (You can google for the trail head.) This is a public hiking/mountain biking trail. [Here's a picture I took near the bottom.](http://imgur.com/oMmwvCr) And there's a great [installed bench](http://imgur.com/mEVK1hD) nearby if you want to relax with some coffee or a sandwich. The trail goes many miles up into the palisades.  
  
[Bale Grist Mill.](http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=482) Built in 1846, it's a functioning, water powered mill. One of only two remaining west of the Mississippi and now part of the state park system. They sell stone ground flour etc. Access to the grounds is free. A guided tour is $5.  
  
[Safari West.](http://www.safariwest.com/) A pretty epic exotic animal preserve that gives safari style tours. It's expensive and I've only been once but I felt it was totally worth it. Tour starts at $72.  
  
[The French Laundry.](http://www.thomaskeller.com/tfl) is a Thomas Keller restaurant in Yountville. This is very expensive and if you don't have a reservation you probably wont get one before your visit but it's notable so I'm including it anyway. It's one of the finest restaurants in the world. Prix fixe is $295. For two with drinks you're probably looking at about $900+.  
  
[The Culinary Institute of America.](http://www.ciarestaurantgroup.com/california-restaurants-bakeries/) (in Saint Helena) They have an amazing restaurant and bakery. This school produces some of America's finest chefs. The restaurant is fine dinning but much more affordable than The French Laundry because it's actively used to train students. A real life Hell's Kitchen. Plus, [this is what it looks like.](http://i.imgur.com/BbRX7cb.jpg) I believe it will run about $50 per person not including drinks.  
  
[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom.](https://www.sixflags.com/discoverykingdom) This one is about 10-15 minutes from Napa. It's pretty much your standard Six Flags. It's a combination amusement park and zoo. They have penguins, a white tiger etc. General admission is $45 online, $65 at the door. Concessions inside are all absurdly priced.  
  
More notes:  
  
Yountville, Saint Helena, and Calistoga are all very walkable and very, very safe. Calistoga also has a bike rental place where you can rent bikes for less than $20 a day.  
  
Also, if you're coming from another state keep in mind that we're in the middle of a severe drought and some pictures online might be greener than how they currently look in real life.

"Do you like nature or hiking? We have some of the best trails in Napa Valley.  Check the Oak Hill trail in Calistoga, Bothe Park and Skyline for fabulous treks.

How about music? Check the calendar at the Uptown, Yountville and the Opera House.

Do you like science? Check out the petrified forest or the Old Faithful geyser. Only 3 geysers in the world are reliable and known to predict quakes. This one is privately owned, and a tiny bit cheesey but the science is very cool.

The Ghost Tour around downtown Napa is kind of cool. It is a fun walking tour with lots of info on crazy stuff that has happened around town.  In fact, all the the walking tours are fun.

Will you be here when the Bale Mill is grinding? It is a stellar example of civil war era technology.  

I don't know if the earthquake walking tour will still be going on. Hopefully, town will be cleaned up.
