Bremerton=economically depress but kinda recovering bad polices and changing economic demographics county wide ravaged bremetton in the late 80s early 90s. And it shows.

Silverdale = still growing.  In some ways. non-invoprerated. So not a ""city""  and devoid of city services such as ""law enforcement""  that is handled by the county and response times can be long depending on what is happening,  probably in the top 2 for school districts in the county.

Port orchard = small city in official demo graphics only.  Most of the population lives out side the ofgical city limits. Making its actually population closer to that of bremertons.  County seat. And home to things like the county jail and cort house. And comes with the problems having those near by comes with.


Gorst =  not a town, not a city.  But you need to eb aware of it.  Its basicly a small stop on the highway.  That is the choke point for nearly all traffic from the north side of the county to the south side. And is roughly subject to traffic problems. *MILES* long.

"you will just have to come and see. i live in East Bremerton which is actually more north of Bremerton, in between Bremerton and Silverdale. it's awesome. port orchard is a bit more rural with larger lots, but more poverty,  etc. but then there are wealthy areas with big estates. east Bremerton is the suburbia,  lots of schools close, close to shopping, etc. lots of nice single family homes, some on large lots, for reasonable prices. without knowing anything else about you besides having two young kids, this is where i would direct you first. 

the Kitsap area is big and diverse. you have to come check it out, drive around, look at houses, etc.

me personally, i would much rather live north of Bremerton, than South of it. i work in Bremerton and i never have to worry about the traffic to get back to port orchard at night, which can be significant. plus the things i like to do are all better the more north you get.

but port orchard has a rural, quiet charm as well. there are some epic properties there with lots of land. and you are closer to Tacoma if you like that sort of thing and go there regularly.

one thing to note is that Bremerton is a cool town. because of the navy, there are tons of young people living there from all over the world. there are lots of bars, breweries, theater, comedy, events, etc. it is rough around the edges and there are lots of drugs but they keep the downtown area pretty clear and safe. i wouldn't live in town proper, but i love stopping in at a cool spot in town whenever i want, then driving home to my nice suburban property up north of town.",t2_t70cr,protovack,0,1648841709.0,0,t1_i30toty,i30toty,True,No-Forever2056,t3_ttz2x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kitsap/comments/ttz2x0/port_orchard_vs_bremerton/,Port Orchard vs Bremerton,/r/Kitsap/comments/ttz2x0/port_orchard_vs_bremerton/i30toty/,11,r/Kitsap,0,11

I don't know about that...

There most definitely will be people that blindly hate/harm/harass another for where someone is from and or how they identify; another is violating the civil rights of an entire people group that are also US citizens and placing them inside internment camps.

"I've tried them all (4 now 3), and Verizon is the best. I'm at the top of Newberry Hill Rd. I use Verizon's Visible. It was OK at first but has improved.

Before transferring your number, you could just take a number they give you, try it out by swapping the SIM in your device, and if you like the service, open the Visible App, chat with customer service and transfer your number.

"FYI, if you are looking to buy a house, please ensure that you have ACTUAL high speed internet access at that property. Do not rely on the seller to tell you the correct information. A large chunk of the rural properties in the Seabeck area don't have cable or fiber internet. And if you CAN get DSL, it's super slow (like >10Mbps down). Some properties can't even get DSL and can only get GEO satellite service. Starlink is what we use, but this area is at capacity for at least the next year until SpaceX launches more satellites.

"We spend about $12,000/yr at Costco. We buy literally everything we possibly can there. Why? We have the executive membership, and the 2% back pays for the membership plus a hundred or two dollars back into our pockets. Furniture, outdoor stuff, electronics, etc add up quickly. And they have a FANTASTIC return policy. No questions asked. And if something you bought within 30 days goes on sale, they'll refund you the difference. Basically, the membership is worth it because of the perks. On top of that, a lot of the Kirkland band items are just brand name rebranded goods. So they are high quality items for a much cheaper price than usual. Things you can get regularly are TP, paper towels, cleaning supplies, laundry supplies, dog food, dog toys, clothing (most of my clothes are from Costco), cooking ingredients, **$5 roasted chickens**, salads and other ready to eat/cook meals, etc. We live about 30 mins from any ""city"" in Kitsap, so we like to stock up.

" Super Size Me was a propaganda piece that skews facts to push an agenda, not an objective documentary. I'm not saying that fast food is great for people or that the company is an ethical masterpiece but I definitely wouldn't want a school showing that ""documentary"" as fact. 

 As long as it's eaten in moderation, fast food isn't the end of the world. Eating it every day or in huge servings isn't good but a burger and fries every once in a while won't hurt the majority of people. Abstinence only (""all fast food is bad!"") is rarely the right way to teach a child about a subject. 

 I'm not here to tell you how to raise your kid/s but you may want to take your anger down a notch, more on par with what they're doing. They're not forcing you guys to participate, to purchase anything, or to support anything. You can easily just not have your kid join in on the fundraising or camping trip. You could also join the local PTA and participate in meetings to provide ideas for alternative fundraising for the extracurricular trips.

They are following a formula that works and will keep them from losing their shirt.  We get a nicer area and more places to get groceries.  And the increased business competition, particularly with the grocery stores, will help keep things competitive.  Not to mention more jobs.  Win/win. 

If you're not growing you're dying.  And that's what happened to Bremerton in the 80's and 90's.

"One thing to keep in mind is that this is for maintaining the same levy level that exists at present- it's not adding an additional increase, but preventing a reduction.  

Another way to frame that is voting no has only the potential to remove funding from the district. The only way to maintain its present level is to vote yes.

If you're interested in digging at the dollars, you're correct in that the [levy language itself](https://go.boarddocs.com/wa/ckitsd/Board.nsf/files/C9CUPA7CFA0E/$file/Resolution%2004-21-22%20-%20Levy%20Resolution.pdf) doesn't provide an itemization for the levy and appears to be hitting the general fund to help pay for pretty much everything, but here are some resources:

Desert King fig is a good variety for this area.  It is best grown in bush form in this area to maximize the breba crop.  

Black Walnut is toxic to horses and dogs, so I personally avoid it but just make sure it stays on your property if you decide to grow it. 

Cherries do great here, but you will be battling the birds.  I'd definitely grow a dwarf variety and plan on netting it if you want to eat any.

Standard good practice is to replace all if you replace one, otherwise you'll just find yourself doing the work again next week. 

Finally, regarding your willingness to heat up and pry on a belt that's an inch too short, my dad always told me that if you have to force it, you're probably doing it wrong.

"Most cars that have an automatic belt tensioner use the bolt on the tensioner itself to rotate the tensioner into the slack position. It generally requires a second person, high skill, a long wrench, or some combination of all 3. 

Given you admit you're clueless, I'd like to describe how it works a bit more, but I'm having trouble finding the words. The spring is too strong to move without the wrench, so you're adding leverage with the wrench but you're not actually loosening anything (like you did with the alternator.

"From what I gather, is that new construction lumber is required to be certified.  The law is probably directed at contractors.  It does make sense, a contractor could frame a house with horrible wood, then the structure could fail due to the sheer poor quality of materials.

No doubt self-built structures are not the intent of the law.  So, you basically need to walk into the county building permit office and ask this question.  There are people there where it's their job to answer these questions and give you the applicable forms.

People build these types of structures all the time, so, I have no doubt the county will allow it.

" it's to the point now where, if you are vaccinated, and you get sick with cold sxs, there is an argument to be made to not even get tested.  containment was never going to work, and now it is becoming more and more obvious by the day that it was never going to work, and never will work. despite significant isolation procedures, masking, cancelled events, etc...this virus is spreading like wildfire and there is nothing we can do to stop it. all you can do is get vaccinated and enjoy the benefits of significantly reduced risk of hospitalization or death. thats a major benefit and vaccines really do work. but i feel like running around desperately getting more tests for every little sniffle and cough, what is the end game for that? we can't stop it from spreading even among the vaccinated. our prior isolation procedures before the CDC change were very strict--it did nothing. still spreading. what are we going to do? test every person every day whether symptomatic or not, and lock them in a hotel if they test positive? even that wouldn't work.

"this was alcohol related. if you drink and have a problem, get treatment! there are lots of great places in kitsap to do so. jails can only hold so many alcoholics and meth heads. if you want to do something about it, get involved, volunteer or work for a drug/alcohol treatment center, get involved with city planning and help bring better recreation and parks to the area (people are less likely to abuse drugs if there are better things to do). 

most importantly, don't play the political blame game. support police, they are the first line of defense. hold county prosecutors accountable and don't let them release dangerous people on zero bail but remember, there are only so many places to put them. if you feel we need more space, you would need to advocate for building a larger jail. all of this stuff costs huge amounts of money though.

"WM likely underpays their staff and so they are constantly hurting for employees. the good people that actually stay and work do a great job. its fairly common for them to announce no recycling pickup for weeks at a time. but they will pick up everything you put out when they finally do come. and they always get the garbage at least. the county gets on them when things get sketchy, and it will get better for a while, then get worse again. the end game is that if WM doesn't get their shit together consistently, eventually the county will come up with another solution. the issue is that whatever that solution is, it would probably involve higher rates, even if the service was better. a lot of people in kitsap are really trashy, cheap, and stingey...and would complain to no end about higher rates and many would just start illegally dumping trash. so Waste Management works for kitsap, right now.

"You are not alone. They say FU to most of us, if not all of us. 

Unfortunately, you have to wait \[unless you do it yourself\]. We are at their whim, and there is no incentive for them to get better, try harder or to change. 

You'll hear WM 'civilian lobbyist Karens' on Nextdoor saying ""They are doing their best. They are understaffed, so be nice.""... or some other bs. 

Well, I hope this isn't their best, and of course, they are. Who would want to work for a company that treats their customers this badly \[failure to give credit, late/no notice of a missed collections, etc.\]?  Usually customer relations is a good indicator of how an employee will be treated as well as the general morale on the job. Even a $2000 sign on bonus, with a decent salary wouldn't get people to join their ranks. That should tell everyone something. 

We live in a small HOA community now, so taking our trash/recycling/compost to the dump isn't an option for us \[even though we have to personally deal with overflowing cans on a regular basis\]. We already pay for it, so whatever. But, if we didn't already pay for it in our dues we wouldn't be giving WM a dime, and would just do it ourselves. 

We also don't have a great vehicle to deal with it. We have a clean, small car with a tiny trunk, but the smell of trash on a hot summer afternoon can make most come up with an ingenious way to make things work.  If we didn't live in our HOA, I suspect a small trailer, the installation of a hitch, and the gas $ would be a more cost effective way and less of a hassle than dealing with WM in the long run.

"Thanks for that. I tried the extra pick up but it doesn't make a difference. WM apparently will only pick up extra on the regular scheduled day. And that's what WM calls ""before your scheduled day"".   


 I'm grateful for people that work any sanitation /garbage/recycling job as well. I get they're short staffed and we had a major weather event, hence why not just leave a note or something. All they've done is just make a bigger hassle for me and them.  


Maybe I'm just not use to this level of service? I had Republic Services before and they have had troubles too but I guess they handled it better. They would do off schedule but it would be a bit out, and if something like that was up they'd leave note.

"I see my post has some upvotes, so I'll update here: I don't think anyone has (fresh, plantable) chestnut seeds anywhere. I think I'll need to start looking in August and expect general availability in September and October. I do think I could still sprout them by spring if I had some right now, but I don't think I'll find any.

Also, I hadn't really given much thought, but importing, planting, and exporting seeds may be regulated for agricultural protection (as in protection form pests, diseases, and invasive species). So I'll need to research that, but offhand I think I'm OK buying in-state fresh chestnuts, planting them in-state, and selling them in-state. I will definitely research more before doing so.

Incidentally, I am of course talking about chestnut tree seedlings. There is a thing called a water chestnut that is banned in the state of WA...interesting tidbit. Can't plant those here.

I'm also starting to ask myself if there are any grower community toes I would step on by trying to sell sprouted seeds or saplings. I clearly don't have the time and space to produce my own seeds in the next several years, so I would basically just be taking someone else's seeds, sprouting them, and competing with the seller? I doubt that's a thing to worry about, but I want to check.

Also I'll want to consider what species of tree seed I want, and whether I want to get seeds from multiple sources. Someone who plants trees for production will want or need two different types to produce nuts as I currently understand, so I'll need to figure out the demand for different types.",t2_do6e2,midnightFreddie,0,1640802350.0,0,t1_hqfu32s,hqfu32s,True,midnightFreddie,t3_rq2l9a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kitsap/comments/rq2l9a/source_to_buy_local_chestnut_seeds/,Source to buy local chestnut seeds?,/r/Kitsap/comments/rq2l9a/source_to_buy_local_chestnut_seeds/hqfu32s/,1,r/Kitsap,0,1

"I had a Mitsubishi ductless system put in three or four years ago. AC and heat.  1,500 sq ft house.  I went with three zones but I probably could have done it with two.  One of mine is a ceiling unit.  They're more expensive but I highly recommend it.  They have a thermostat and can be app controlled.  Wall units are exterior walls only and remote controlled.  My total cost was $12,000.  

I went with Air Masters in Port Orchard.  They did great work and had it done in one day.  I've been happy with the system.  Waaay better than the old baseboard heaters I had.  And much cheaper to run.

"I would like to think that there is generally a reason people don't live near to where they work and I'm going to go ahead and believe it's not because they want to commute from further away through congested traffic.

It's a roadway infrastructure problem that has been poorly managed for decades. 

If (and it's unlikely) all of those people that commute from Port Orchard and beyond COULD find a place to rent or buy in Silverdale/Bremerton, do you really belive those roadways could handle the influx of traffic? It's already shitty enough driving around Silverdale/Bremerton at peak times.

The traffic flow isn't going to decrease anytime soon and realistically people are not moving to SILVERDALE AND BREMERTON to escape the horror of what is the shitty roadway infrastructure of the Kitsap Pennisula.
