"You've got some solid recommendations! I'm going to add a few favorites as well... However I'm pretty one-note lol

First I'd say Venice isn't sketchy so much as crowded and sometimes gross, as others said. However, it's a great spot to skate!

If you like cocktails and live music, look at Blind Barber. It's a speakeasy with an actual barbershop in the front. Very cute, but sometimes a bit crowded and on the pricier side.

Others have mentioned the Culver Hotel. Also a joy when it reopens for music, cocktails, and pricy dinner with the added bonus of its history.

Backstage Bar is a fun one for karaoke. It's right behind Sony Pictures so you sometimes get an odd celebrity sighting. It has a lot of regulars and a divey vibe.

If you're willing to get just a bit outside of Culver City, you can find excellent live music at The Mint or Winston House.

"Would second the recco for etta. We went last week for a 20th anniversary dinner. Not only was the food fantastic, but the service was amazing - considerate without being hovering. Definitely order the foccacia with truffle honey butter. If you like elote, I'm still dreaming of their sweet corn side. Their valet, shared with the newly opened hotel The Shay, isn't very well thought out, so give yourselves some extra time if you're valet parking.

Everyone's definition of sketchy is objective. If your family isn't prepared to see a massive homeless problem, I'd skip Venice. Sketchy and depressing are two different things. If depressing doesn't bother you, book a dinner or lunch at Gjelina or Gjusta. Owned by the same folks and very high quality food. If you love coffee, visit the Mecca that is Intelligentsia (though be prepared for some serious airs; these folks are Very Serious About Coffee). But even for someone who's lived in LA for more than 25+ years, the homelessness issue in Venice - and other parts of LA - is disconcerting.

Downtown Culver City is charming. The Culver Hotel is where the midgets stayed while filming ""The Wizard of Oz"" (filmed at the Culver Studios across the street, now owned by Amazon). Lundeen's is a small business with thoughtful gifts, cards, and carefully selected books. Salt and Straw has excellent ice cream. Potato Chips Deli is a good place to grab a sandwich, and Upper Crust Pizzeria has first-class pizza. You probably don't have a Mendocino Farms near you, but they are a great place for lunch at the relatively new Culver Steps. My favorite is the vegan Banh Mi, and I'm not a vegan. It's just crazy delicious.

A hidden gem on a weekday is Jackson Market. We used to live around the block from it, and I miss their tasty wraps for lunch. Beware their pre-packaged sides, though, because they are usually just stuff from Costco that they put in a plastic container and over-charge you for.

"Welcome! Culver is pretty small and we have some strict vaccination requirements here when compared to Florida. You're supposed to present proof of vaccination to enter any restaurant, for example, so just be warned. Also, people take masking here much more seriously than in Florida (I was just in Florida for the last month, it was jarring).

That being said, downtown Culver City is very nice to walk around, grab bite and a drink, etc. Honey Kettle downtown is some good fried chicken. It's been awhile since I've been anywhere else down there though.The Culver Hotel is beautiful to visit and have a nice meal at, if it's reopened by the time you get here (the restaurant part, that is).

The Museum of Jurassic Technology is a strange, fun diversion: https://www.mjt.org/. 

Sage Bistro is a fantastic vegan restaurant.

Mega Grille has some good pizza.

King's Kebab/King's Cafe is a great, low-key coffee shop if you want some serious chill.

If you want a ludicrous, expensive dining EXPERIENCE (seriously, all caps warranted), give Vespertine a try. I haven't been yet (I don't really make Vespertine money), but it's supposed to be amazing.

Cafe Laurent is nice for breakfast/brunch.

Samosa House is solid for some quick Indian food.

If you want to get outdoors, Kenneth Hahn Park is beautiful and I would also recommend the Stoneview Nature Center, which has some hiking trails and is great if you have kids.

As for Venice Beach, it's sketchier than ever with the homeless problem being so bad here in LA. Mostly safe during the day, but don't be shocked if you see a homeless person randomly just take a shit on the sidewalk.

The closet beach is probably Playa Del Rey, which is decent enough, though parking can be a chore. Marina Del Rey also had a small beach. Just note that LA beaches aren't as nice as Florida beaches, in general. The sand is rougher , the water is freezing and the waves can get pretty large. At least that's my assessment after living in Florida for 10 years (lived on both coasts) and being in California for about 5 now.

"I disagree. A street with 6 lanes (3 in each direction) is fundamentally a street for cars ‚Äî it would make the downtown area much less walkable and people-friendly. You can‚Äôt have a charming downtown while also running six lanes of cars.

Traffic and lane-counts is a tricky thing.

I‚Äôve sat in hellacious traffic in Culver Blvd multiple times back when it was two lanes, and I have no doubt it would still be bad if we somehow added a third lane.

From an efficiency standpoint, improving bike and bus service is an big efficiency gain‚Äîin many cases, that‚Äôs fewer cars on the roads because folks now have other options.

I understand the frustration of traffic‚Äîthis city has an unhealthy reliance on cars.  But lets be honest, the traffic in that area would be bad whether Culver Blvd has one lane or 3 lanes. 

The protected bike lane makes bike commuting and travel a true option in this area rather than a death wish, and  the dedicated bus lane will make the bus line a more attractive option.

"I switched to Ting from Spectrum. They ask where you want to put the modem, it gets attached to the wall and they drill through the wall to get the fiber into the house. They‚Äôll install a grey box on the outside of the house which they need to dig a trench to get to from the black box on the street.

They had to do it in two takes for me since the original path to the original box on the house went through the neighbor‚Äôs yard. They came back moved the box which was way better, it was behind the fence and then I had them thread the fiber under the house in the crawl space which required drilling a hole in the floor alongside the wall but it‚Äôs no big deal.

I would say to plan out where you want the modem on the wall in your house, then figure out where you want the box outside the house that can be trenches to from their black box on the street.

Jolly Oyster - pretty awesome. A little pricey, but really good, fresh seafood.

"I agree that LA has a lack of low cost housing, but tearing down KSMO will accomplish nothing towards this goal.

KSMO is the only private airport small time flyers can use in this area of the city. You can‚Äôt just ‚Äúmove to LAX‚Äù - not immediately at least; that‚Äôs tantamount to saying ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just run super-heavy freight trains on light rail lines‚Äù. The only other airport like KSMO nearby is Van Nuys.

Also, it‚Äôs Santa Monica - the land value is extremely high. You can‚Äôt just magically put ‚Äúaffordable housing‚Äù on land with extremely high value. High value land, by definition = expensive housing. You can‚Äôt run a business that costs more to upkeep than it takes in.

Lack of land isn‚Äôt even the problem. As a solid D Democrat, our problem is way too much regulation. We have made it IMPOSSIBLE to build cheap housing by making the permitting process as laborious as possible, restricting zoning to prevent high density construction, and by enforcing extremely high quality standards.

Reality to fixing affordable housing is going to be in deregulating our byzantine zoning and permitting process, not clearing up a tiny bit of land in Santa Monica. We need to be building shitloads of cheapo, no frills, high density, dingbat style apartments in CHEAP areas (read: not Santa Monica, Malibu, Westwood, etc) and getting rid of single family housing entirely in the urban centers.

"Here‚Äôs the skinny on Los Angeles‚Äôs building situation:

We have an incredibly high regulatory burden: building a new apartment here is an extremely long and expensive process, buildings must meet strict seismic standards and include things like parking and eco-friendly concessions, and maximum height is extremely limited. On top of that, we employ rent control quite widely. 

All of this combined means that it is virtually impossible to actually construct a financially feasible low-cost apartment for lower market segments, combined with extreme demand for units from people moving in from elsewhere (for example, young people trying to get into film and arts), we are experiencing outsized growth in the high end / luxury / mixed use apartment segment. These are going to be built in the last 10 years or so, have the newest energy efficient appliances, hardwood floors, granite countertops, very high quality insulation, and lots of amenities like exercise equipment/gyms, first floor retail, and often washing machines in unit. Air conditioning/central air is always there.

I am familiar with The Roy - it‚Äôs very new so it‚Äôs going to be quite well appointed. As someone in their 20s with borderline 6 figure income, I would not live in one of those luxury units unless I was sharing the rent with an equal income partner. That being said, I am a fanatical retirement saver so I prioritize cost cutting, if you have different priorities you may consider the dwelling amenities worth it.

If we try to move downmarket, there is a vast ‚Äúno man‚Äôs land‚Äù gap until you get back to the 1950s-1970s apartment buildings, most of them being the dingbat style. These were built in a massive wave over that period of time, before the massive building regulations set in. These were cheaply made, mass-produced, and often developed by individuals or families as a real estate investment. 

By comparison, these units *are* spartan. Almost never have central air, those that have any AC usually have a single wall unit, and many do not have air conditioning at all. They usually have a plethora of resistive space heaters that were in the apartment originally. When it comes to other appliances, they are usually a frankenstein of different eras, often 20-30+ y/o dishwashers/refrigerators (waste lots of water/energy v modern units), electric stoves, etc. Popcorn ceilings, carpet floors (hard and soft), and extremely little insulation, both with regards to sound, and environment.

I live in a 1970s era building, non-dingbat, and can give more specifics if you‚Äôd like. My landlord is one of the good ones and  is actually obsessive about apartment security and is generally good about maintenance.

Package and bike theft are the main crimes you or I will see in Culver City/Palms (I believe the Roy is in palms, not CC), and it happens maybe 3-4 times a year at my building. We are revamping our security in a big way so it should go down. Overall, it is extremely common here (esp. in quarantine) so you MUST take precautions (pick up packages immediately or PO box). Other than that, there isn‚Äôt a lot of violent crime you should worry about. Palms and CC are generally considered extremely walkable neighborhoods and there are tons of people walking dogs at night.

I live in a ‚Äúluxury‚Äù building with an ‚Äúenclosed garage‚Äù (you can easily jump and enter from above) where things have been stolen from multiple cars, my car was opened and rummaged, and someone CAR was stolen - from inside the garage. Nothing has been done this past year to stop people from jumping over the gate. Surprisingly none of our packages have been stolen. Yesterday I saw an old dude that didn‚Äôt look homeless poop in the street in front of the apartment complex.

"Culver City is a kinda big area with different sub-areas (with their own vibe. It is all pretty nice and residential. 

There are fewer homeless camps inside Culver compared to across the street in City of Los Angeles. Culver City feels safer to me, Culver City PD seems to run a tighter ship in general. 

If you can afford it, I would try to get closer to Downtown Culver/Sony/the train. Culver will only be more desirable /congested moving forward with Amazon, HBO, Apple, Sony, The Platform...and tons of construction around the Hayden Tract and over on La Cienega...etc all really taking off. Plus this gets you pretty easily into Downtown and over to Santa Monica. 

I work in Culver in the Hayden Tract and dislike leaving the office between 2:30pm and 6pm. There are alot of schools and people commuting, it gets gridlocked. I work a 10-7pm schedule and it feels pretty breezy comparatively.

"All the elementary schools in culver are pretty good.

All 3 of those schools are great and because of these little variances their lower test scores don‚Äôt really reflect the great teaching going on.

"Some of my local favorites:

Simpang Asia (never had Indonesian food prior to this - I recommend the Rothi Paratha and Mei Tek Tek)

Lokal (great sandwiches. A handful of different Bahn Mi‚Äôs. I‚Äôm a big fan of the chicken Bahn Mi but truly all their sandwiches are great)

DT Culver City - tons to choose from. Honey Kettle kitchen is a staple so I‚Äôd start there. Tons of chain restaurants too like Tender Greens, Chipotle, CAVA, etc. I wouldn‚Äôt touch Ugo with a ten foot pole. I think public school and rush st are mediocre but worth trying as they‚Äôve been there forever and people seem to like it more than I do.

Maple Block - great BBQ but super slow service and even for BBQ it‚Äôs overpriced. Down the street is Holy Cow BBQ (also a SAGE in that plaza if you‚Äôre vegan) if you‚Äôd like BBQ that‚Äôs a little more inexpensive.

Kotoya - one of the best ramen broths in the game but I‚Äôve noticed I can‚Äôt eat this place without feeling like complete trash after. Smooth as hell going down but you‚Äôll have a rough time after.

Phovorite - my favorite Pho on the west side. I‚Äôd pay the extra couple of dollars and get the filet mignon Pho and get their sides of chili oil in individual containers. To die for.

Nathalee Thai - solid Thai food. Gives me In-N-Out vibes in the sense that you can‚Äôt drive by this place without smelling that goodness they are cooking up.

Pampas Grill - I think it‚Äôs considered Brazilian if I‚Äôm not mistaken? Cafeteria style home cooked food where you are charged by weight and you get to pick what meats you want where they take it straight off the grill. Delicious but a little pricey.

The Doughroom - really not a fan of the service here as I‚Äôve had multiple bad experiences but man oh man can they cook a damn good pizza. The spicy bear has honey and pepperoni on it. Never would I have thought that would be a good combo and that‚Äôs why I could never have made it in the pizza world. 

Dave‚Äôs Hot Chicken - they are opening one in place of Smash Burger (didn‚Äôt miss much there) right next to the CPA. If you are into the Nashville hot chicken sandwich, this is an easy second best after Howlin Rays.

The Donut King - this is a breakfast staple. The sweet Asian women that works/runs the place seems to know everyone. When me and my SO walk in she‚Äôs already memorized our orders and we chat it up. My go to is an everything bagel with spicy egg, sausage, avocado, bacon, onions, and the love she cooks it with.

If you want to give me a general direction of things you‚Äôre interested in I‚Äôd be happy to tailor some things that might be more of interest to you and your SO.",t2_127xf8,BreezyLovejoy69,0,1604991815.0,0,t1_gbt1uj6,gbt1uj6,False,bleuannecy,t3_jrbf73,https://www.reddit.com/r/culvercity/comments/jrbf73/culver_city_neighborhoods/,Culver City neighborhoods,/r/culvercity/comments/jrbf73/culver_city_neighborhoods/gbt1uj6/,4,r/culvercity,0,4
"Having lived in both Palms and Culver, I think Culver is better. First off, the parking on the south side of Venice is SO much easier than on the north side. If you ever have guests over the parking is almost impossible in Palms. Also, I like that Culver City is its own city. There's more of a community feel with having our own city council, our own school district, our own downtown area, etc. There are one-bedroom apartments near downtown Culver that fit your budget, and the area in my opinion feels completely safe. You also mentioned biking to Playa del Rey, so you could consider living near the Ballona Creek bike path, which is great and goes directly there.

I‚Äôve spent a fair amount of time in both states in the last several years. They're not the same places they were when I was growing up: they are smaller and sadder than I remember them. They seem hollowed out. I loved growing up Midwestern, but for me, that place is gone.

Culver City is the first place in California that, imo, shared some of the wonderful aspects of Midwestern life - being friendly with your neighbors, community responsibility, feeling safe in your surroundings - with what I view as the positives of living in a larger city: greater tolerance, acceptance, and diversity, less provincial social norms, and better access to art, culture, entertainment, different foods, a better selection of goods. There are other benefits as well - I don't want to sell Southern California short! It's going to be a lot more expensive, but if you take the good advice of people here about very real things like commute seriously, you can minimize those and other annoyances.

We're a pretty blue neighborhood, but I have neighbors that are staunchly red, if only because that's how their parents voted. Even in these highly polarized times, we‚Äôre still able to care more about each other‚Äôs health, happiness, and welfare than how we vote. We check in on one another; we have each other's back. I have to say, I give consideration to my neighbors' sometimes objectionable views with almost the same weight as I give political disputes in my own family. Which is to say, I think, ""Well, I have to live around them, we see each other almost every day, so we better find a way to agree to disagree on this and move on.""

Life in LA is different, but Culver City hits a sweet spot, I think. It will take some getting used to. You may have to give it time. But your writing is an indication of an open-minded curiosity and intelligence that, to me, suggests you may well love it here, so good luck!",t2_3vp7j,MKinLA,0,1593141394.0,0,t1_fw0x9cl,fw0x9cl,False,anythinghere08412,t3_hdw07u,https://www.reddit.com/r/culvercity/comments/hdw07u/tell_me_more_about_culver_city/,Tell me more about Culver City,/r/culvercity/comments/hdw07u/tell_me_more_about_culver_city/fw0x9cl/,2,r/culvercity,0,2

"We‚Äôre trying to think of things we could downsize from. Do suggest not bringing our grill with you?

We currently have a minivan and an Ford Expedition. I will say that it felt like parking spots are far more slender in OK than WI, but ironically people drive bigger here. Now that‚Äôs it summer I‚Äôve seen an increase in excessively sized trucks, I personally don‚Äôt see the point. 

Anyways, it will be interesting to see if we find CA parking to be even smaller. My husband is already potentially on board for selling his SUV for a smaller car and we‚Äôd keep the van (paid off and can fit our family of 5 easily).

"Don't believe everything you read about CA, the rest of the country loves to romanticize/hate it. And, don't group LA with SF. They're, what, 400 miles apart? That's like DC to Boston.

The traffic isn't as bad here as, say, Washington DC, but the vastness of LA is difficult to understand, and there isn't the same walkable fabric of a city as D.C. or NYC or SF. That can be a good thing--many different distinct areas to explore from suburban to fully urban, to the natural beauty of Malibu or Palos Verdes. You can be at the beach, in the forest, on the mountains, etc. all in one day.

The industries here are extremely diverse too. Aerospace is huge in El Segundo and at NASA JPL, education/academic research/universities are huge (USC, UCLA, Cal Tech, Pepperdine, etc.) to name a few. Of course there is lots of finance, and tech (see: ""Silicon Beach""), the arts and of course film/TV/entertainment. Museums and the arts are quite good as well: The Broad, LACMA, Annenberg Space for Photos, UCLA's/USC's museums, Calif. Science Center, etc. LA Phil is the best orchestra I've ever heard, and USC and Colburn have great music programs, too.

The cuisine here is like nowhere else. You can find virtually any kind of food and it will be good. Cost of living is higher, but it isn't nearly as high as SF, NYC, Boston, DC or even Seattle IMO. Buying a house is very expensive though, it will be hard to find \*literally\* anything in the greater LA area for less than $500k. 50% are renters.

Culver City (no butter burgers here :P)  is kind of central-west LA. Pretty safe, not far from the beach, and not toooo far from DTLA. Nice arts district, decent amount of young people. Culver City is next to the metro and has decent bus service--you can take the Expo line to Santa Monica or DTLA. Trendy restaurants and things near Culver City hotel, and The Platform, as well as at the Helm's Bakery district. It's not quite urban and not quite suburban either, and has been up-and-coming for a little while now. There's a nice little arts district and some great restaurants. You are also close to some decent nature in Baldwin Hills Scenic overlook, and not to far from the Marina/beach. Some good restaurants in the area are Sage, Simpang Asia, Kogi, El Chato, etc.

Job wise, you can get pretty far in 30-40 minutes...Depending on the direction maybe 10-15 miles, which covers a good swath of LA. Major job centers are probably in Playa Vista, Westwood/Santa Monica, DTLA and El Segundo, which are probably all within your range.

Your kids will likely have a much more worldly and diverse experience growing up in LA than in, say, Milwaukee. It is very culturally rich, and does not suffer the same casual racism and segregation as in Milwaukee. The west side has a large Persian population in Westwood/Beverly Hills, there's a large orthodox Jewish population near Century City, Sawtelle Japantown is not far, Santa Monica is more classically Californian, there's a large mosque in Culver City, Koreatown is big, and so on. Lots of people with different beliefs, and cultures, without having to think too much about it. In my experience, politics in CA are way less in your face than on the East Coast. There are actually a fair number of moderates and conservatives, especially among immigrant groups with strong traditions, and in the sense of CA is the world's, what, 6th largest economy and DC is 2,500 miles away--who are they to tell us what to do?  


In general, I think everything in LA is a bit more difficult at a minimum, but a lot more rewarding if you put in that extra effort.",t2_kde0l,lepriccon22,0,1592893221.0,0,t1_fvpvqkm,fvpvqkm,True,anythinghere08412,t3_hdw07u,https://www.reddit.com/r/culvercity/comments/hdw07u/tell_me_more_about_culver_city/,Tell me more about Culver City,/r/culvercity/comments/hdw07u/tell_me_more_about_culver_city/fvpvqkm/,1,r/culvercity,0,1
"Oh gosh, I don't know. There's a lot. 

Obviously prices can be crazy - rent, groceries, gas, etc., but you probably expect all of that. 
Same with traffic - it's not great, but we got a place right off the freeway in Culver City and my husband works right off freeway in Santa Monica, it's actually not bad compared to a lot of people's commutes. It's still crazy to me that the drive can be less than 10 minutes sometimes or occasionally an hour. 

We were a little unprepared for how cutthroat finding an apartment would be though. Be ready to pounce, I don't think good places sit around long for you to think about them. 

Parking was a bit of a shock. It is scarce and the spots seem a lot smaller than I was used to. Even the small spot at my house is accessed via a very narrow, one lane alley. Let's just say my car got a couple of mysterious scratches in the first couple of months. RIP parking pillars. And we have a sedan, I get anxious just thinking about driving big trucks around here. 

Let's see, what else? I don't miss yard work, but I do miss having a real yard with a grill. And my husband misses having a garage very much. It also took a while to get used to family back home freaking out any time wildfires make the news (which is often). And earthquakes (which aren't so often - at least not in the last 4 years). 

We actually picked Culver City for the schools, but my daughter was not a fan of the high school, lol. Her complaints were large class sizes, ""loud, disrespectful kids"" and the complete lack of an orchestra program (she previously played bass). Mostly she was just mad about moving, so take it with a grain of salt. The lockers and stuff were mostly outside like in the movies - I thought that was neat (teenager did not care though, ha). 

My personal favorite thing is that I don't need a car. Like, I have one and I do use it, but I am within walking distance of several delicious local food places, a handful of small specialty markets, a supermarket, a bunch of random places like... a hardware store. I'm used to having to drive to get anywhere, but now I have all this stuff close to me and still live in a neighborhood with lots of families. I suppose this is kind of specific to where you wind up and where you're coming from, but it's my favorite part for sure. 

Well, that and being a short drive from the ocean. That's cool too. 

Oh, and the views! I really love seeing mountains off in the distance whenever I'm driving on the freeway. I grew up in flat places, so mountains will always delight me.

"Thank you for your response. I know there will be a sticker shock, but the military should at least cover housing costs. I‚Äôm also hoping that my income will reflect the increase in cost of living, the larger concern will be finding a job that fits. 

My specific area is manufacturing and cost accounting at a management level. I‚Äôve learned the hard way that I can succeed at a large corporate office (Hertz), but I don‚Äôt like the culture. Too many cliques and tit for tat, but I think part of that is due to OKC culture. I personally find most accountants around here are not of the same caliber that come my university and they are ok without making any career moves. They just like things the way there are, if you know what I mean.

"2100 sf in Culver City will cost you $4,000+/month to *rent*. Houses in Culver City start at about $900,000 for some blown-up and/or tiny shit. A 2100 sf home that is habitable will be $1.2 million+, easily.

Granted, the current economy could put a dent in that, but you're in for some real sticker shock when it comes to housing prices if things don't go south.

Commute depends on where you work. Culver City is great in the sense that it's close to a lot of highways. Unfortunately, those highways are dogshit during non-pandemic times. You do have the option of taking the Expo train line to downtown, if you work there, which is usually a pretty pleasant ride.

I live in Culver and work in downtown LA. My normal commute is about 45 minutes in the morning, an hour in the evening. I find the Expo line to add about 10 minutes to my morning commute and is pretty much a wash in the evening.

Job opportunities... Impossible to tell given the current situation. Unemployment in LA is more than 20%.

In a normal economy, LA is a very competitive market for job opportunities, with A LOT of highly qualified folks vying for jobs here. It took me 8 months to get a new job after applying to 100+ jobs, though I was seeking government jobs, which can be their own special blend of insanity. Private sector won't likely take as long from application to hire, but might be more competitive in terms of applicants.

THAT BEING SAID...

I love Culver City. Cost of living is awful, but I'm paying for a 10-minute drive to the beach, access to lots of highways, 10-20 degrees cooler than the Valley at any one time and a school district where I can largely put my child's education concerns in the background. The downtown is small, but very nice.

I have no idea how long I'll be able to afford to live here, but I'm hoping that this current situation brings prices down to a far more sane level. As of now, prices don't seem to be budging much, but there are few listings and they're not selling particularly fast.

We'll see.

"I‚Äôve done a few searches and it already seems a better option than Lubbock, the cost of living is partially what makes me so nervous.

"The other commenters gave great advice already. I just wanted to add that the Culver City school system is TOP NOTCH, so if you can live (and of course work near) CC than you definitely should. I always joke that we won't move from CC until my daughter turns 18 so that she doesn't have to go to a LAUSD school (or private). They have language immersion programs, STEM programs, etc. My child is only 3 but we are excited to start with the CC school system next year for what is essential Pre K or the year before Kindergarten. The (decent) daycares in all of Los Angeles are going to have wait lists but that's just how it is.  There are in home daycares that are a little easier to get into but we had a terrible experience with one and I don't recommend them. We have her in a daycare/preschool in Baldwin Hills area, it's a little further out but we used to live in that area and didn't want to deal with the hassle of trying to get on a wait list for a more expensive school.

"Being military, we will get a cola adjustment based on zip codes. We should also be able to get leased housing (they pay for the rent based on the size of the family), so we should have housing covered, but it still makes me crazy nervous. 

I didn‚Äôt even think about gas, in OK it is crazy cheap. 

I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll be fine, we were originally slotted for Lubbock, TX, so this is a step up for job and housing opportunities for us. CA is just so very different form anything I‚Äôve ever known, and don‚Äôt even get me started on politics. It‚Äôs not that Im admitting to following any specific party, I just don‚Äôt like polarizing views and try to be moderate. It aggravates me to know end when people literally hate and degrade each other for having a different point of view. 

This just came up today and I‚Äôm so very nervous. I love being in the Midwest and never envisioned living anywhere near either coast (or the Deep South, but that‚Äôs not the question here.) 

How is the diversity? The economics? We lived in two communities that are upper middle income and honestly, it‚Äôs more than I prefer. I don‚Äôt like the keeping up the jones crap and I don‚Äôt like the snubbery. Our current school district caters highly towards high income, single working parent families. People just can‚Äôt imagine their kids taking the bus to school and moms spends hours each day dropping their kids off to various schools. It makes it very difficult for working families to balance schools with their jobs. 

I also want to ask, I know you don‚Äôt know much about the schools. But what are things looking like for the fall? I can‚Äôt imagine balancing both parents working full time and managing virtual schooling for elementary age kids. 

What about daycares?  Our youngest will be 1.5 years when we move. Do we have to worry about year long wait lists to get into decent childcare? 

Thank you again for all feedback.

"There's lots of opportunities here. I echo what u/superi4n said. I've always lived close to my job to minimize the commute. That is crucial. Or find a place that you can commute using the Metro. It's not bad if there's a rail station nearby. 

I don't have kids in school so I can't comment on that. 

The cost of living is very expensive for rent and mortgages. It's not possible to find a 2100 sq ft house for $1400. To rent a house that size you're probably looking in the $4000 to $5000 range. I'm sure you've already looked in that, if not check Zillow. Gas is also more expensive, as are income taxes. I've heard all of this called the ""Sunshine Tax."" 

That said it's still worth it. As you know we have the best weather. The food is outstanding. The beaches are wonderful. If you're into hiking there are so many fun trails. I think there is a lot of natural beauty here: mountains, trees, beaches, oceans, and desert.

Culver is good because it's centrally located. You can get to the east or west side quickly. Another thing to consider for housing is something close to the freeway. It can take 20 minutes just to get to the freeway if you're not close.

"Thank you. My husband is military and we would get a cost of living adjustment for him and hopefully housing would be covered. 

We have 3 boys - 1.5 yrs, 7 and 9. The oldest has ADHD and struggles socially. Can you tell me about the schools? What do the school years look like? Here we start mid Aug and get out mid/late May. I grew up with the school year primarily between Labor Day and Memorial Day.

"Sorry to hear you have a lot of fears. I grew up in California and really enjoy it here. Just quick thoughts about moving to LA/Culver in general,

1) Commute - Try to live close to work. Since I've lived in LA, I've tried to structure my commute so I'm going opposite of the heavy traffic direction. Many us learn to adapt and download plenty of podcasts/audiobooks.

2) Jobs - I can imagine your skill being in high demand although I'm not in your industry. You can try to find something that you are passionate about or something to just pay the bills.

3) Cost of living increase - I would assume you can get paid more here in California but that depends on what type of job and position you end up getting.

You're welcome. Seriously. You should start thinking for yourself. My parents raised me Catholic to believe that anyone who didn't accept Jesus as their personal savior would burn in hell for eternity. When I was THIRTEEN I realized how fucked up that was. That someone who had been born into a different religion was fucked.  Really really think about it. Do you really believe someone is listening when you mumble at the floor five times a day? Or could that be a brainwashing technique used to keep you off balance and using your own critical thought?  You live in Culver City. Go to Sorrento's and get a nice Chicken Parmesan Sandwich (I would say get an Italian but it has pork in it) and a Cannoli and have a long think about if anyone is really listening to you mumble at the floor and why your religion requires you to do that. Hint...it's a brainwashing technique.

I don't think you realize that this is a Christian nation and this won't stand for very long. November will be interesting.  The Christian silent majority will make themselves known.  Also...Culver City is it's own municipality. I imagine the mosque paid them off to allow this.  That's why it happened in Culver City.

"No in-unit laundry unfortunately, that's honestly one of only two major issues I have with the place. The other is that it's hard to get food delivered because the complex is so huge (delivery people have trouble with the instructions).

Management is friendly enough. No issues with neighbors. Can be a little loud occasionally, but that's probably a hazard at any apartment you would live at. Modest rent increase at year end.

"The Meadows is in my neighborhood (Fox Hills) and I walk by it frequently. It's a very large complex and appears to be well maintained.  Fox Hills is a neighborhood of condos, apartments and some office parks. It's more of a suburban vibe. Cobalt is a mixed-use, 5 story or so building that is more in the center of the city and directly across the street from Sony. The Harlow is in downtown Culver City near where Amazon is building their new studios, and is also a mixed use building. At Cobalt and Harlow you would be able to easily walk to grocery stores, etc. Not quite as much in Fox Hills although there is a very big mall here with a Target and Trader Joe's in it.

[La Dijonaise](http://ladijonaise.com/) isn't a coffee shop, per se, but has great to-go coffee and pastries and you can sit in their courtyard or anywhere else in the Helms complex to enjoy the Culver City sunshine (currently open for takeout and delivery 8-3 everyday)!

As to the places already mentioned, the Spot is nice, albeit somewhat ""youthful"" as it's right next to CCHS.
