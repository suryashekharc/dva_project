"Some folks unfortunately associate rising prices in town with newcomers moving in from elsewhere, but that's mostly misdirected blame. Sure, the town might be a little cheaper if the population were shrinking rather than growing, but it's not exactly a boom town and cities are getting expensive everywhere, not just here. There are a lot of reasons for that unrelated to population movement. 

Walla Walla is nicer than Yakima in my opinion. It's a beautiful little city that is part sleepy farming town and part touristy wine destination. Tons of trees and parks. Good food and a neat little downtown area.

"There is nothing to do in the town. So the kids have to make their own fun, while at the same time trying avoid the Cosplay police.

It is a major problem with the town. Most kids that are raised there just want to get out of the town upon graduation. It is a major drain for the community because a kid of any intelligence knows that there is really no future for a young person in Walla Walla/College Place, unless they are cool with a lifetime of slave wages, or are already rich because of their parents. 

Then if there is anything that might be fun or supportive for the youth of the town, politicians and the business owners use the police to shut  down. This type of action has gone on historically for the past 50 years. 

There have been temporary things for the kids in the past, video arcades, dance halls, cruising, youth specific events and they all get shut down.

Alaska says they aren't cancelling flights but we'll see.  Q400 uses less fuel and is cheaper to fly than a jet which is part of what keeps it relatively affordable.

"The field support staff at Windermere have been great.  We tried really hard not to ask for anything while the pandemic was happening.  On the rare occasions we needed something (burst irrigation pipe leaking 250,000 gallons, resulting in a sinkhole that ate a tree, getting a dead mirowave replaced, etc) they implemented solutions quickly and professionally.  It's just that the office staff doesn't want to help with social issues like noise, improper parking and parties.

If you have AC, the heat isn't so bad.  It depends on what your daily routine makes you go out into.  It was only a month or so over 100F.  Just a week of 114F.  I hid in the AC until work time, AC in the car to AC at work.  Like Phoenix or ABQ in August.

There is a thriving agriculture world here.  It's what built Walla Walla.  Wine grapes, vegetable farms, industrial wheat farming, etc all coexist, and the colleges churn out skilled ag workers.  My wife works for some producers and gets to take home vegetables, mushrooms, etc.  That saves us from buying with cash.  I work in wine, and get gifted wine for sales performance, and employee discounts are severe.  We sometimes gift bottles of wine to producers for eggs, meats, cheeses, etc.",t2_ckh5ogou,Enology_FIRE,0,1646675998.0,0,t1_hzqayfx,hzqayfx,False,mynamesnottruck,t3_sua32m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallawalla/comments/sua32m/moving_to_walla_walla/,Moving to Walla Walla,/r/wallawalla/comments/sua32m/moving_to_walla_walla/hzqayfx/,2,r/wallawalla,0,2

"We moved up in 2019, so I could go to the WWCC wine making program.  Wife was PNW originally, and preferred it to my home of Colorado.

Hope you weren't hoping for decent medical care. Town is slammed with retirees but lost one of the two hospitals a few years back. 

The educational system is weak and leaves high school graduates lacking in basic skills (Math/Reading/Critical Thinking).

If you have teens, they will quickly learn to hate the community. Nothing to do except make your own fun, while trying to avoid cops who are just LARPing at their jobs. 

And sure hope you don't have high levels of melanin in your skin. That will make everything in the town more difficult to do.

It's easy to get into going into the country to get drunk and stoned, it was a past time.  I appreciate that it is a ""purple "" place so you are more flexible with others and it is less of an echo chamber.  That being said, as a biracial child,  it was a bit rough at times. 

Walla Walla is an entertainment center for alcohol now and if that's not your scene,  that can limit some things. There is a lot of great art and music in the spring- fall.  I find myself missing diversity that I had in the city when the weather gets cold and the month of fog rolls in. It can get ""heavy "".

"I think you're right.

The delivery drivers used to knock or ring your doorbell when they drop off packages. They didn't do that during December.

"I've been searching around for trails a lot lately. 

The best trail nearby that I've found is West Tiger Creek Trail. Very pretty. Not sure it's snowshoe trail but it's a good one either way. Better have snow tires or chains though because you need to head up some inclines and it's icy right now. I haven't been able to make it up farther than that for trails yet, unfortunately. 

Harrison Park is nice but the trail is washed out by the stream basically right where it starts.

I searched around Tollgate but it's mostly forestry roads. Some nice views but not much in the way of actual hiking trails. Avalanche warning right now too.

Joseph Oregon is awesome, worth the 2.5 hour drive, but again the roads are treacherous now.

"Two years ago, the quality of most restaurants was a lot higher. The pandemic wreaked some havoc on the local restaurants I think. A lot of places that were really good either got kinda bad or are hit/miss now.

That said...

Sweet Basil has maintained pretty high quality. Delicious pizza.

Brasserie Four is quality. Also very good pizza (I love pizza).

Best Pizza Ever used to have the best crust in town but then I think, during the pandemic, the original owner sold it and it kinda went downhill sadly. 

Big Cheese is great for when there's a bunch of kids over the house. Better than Little Ceasars at least.

Murray's Fire Engine Pizza is pretty delicious.

Bacon and Eggs is pretty damn good. Maple Counter also good but a little more $$ I think. 

Shiki Sushi and Tokyo Japanese Steakhouse are both good. Asian Fusion takes a long time but has been pretty consistently good for the past few months.

Phoumy's was disappointing when I tried it. Chiangmai Thai was on point for a good while, but the last few times the flavors were off.

I don't care for any of the Chinese food restaurants here.

Red Monkey is usually good, although some dishes are better than others. Generally my favorite bar/grill in town. 

I've heard Wingman's is good but expensive. 

TMACs is good. 

Crossbuck is good but their weird tipping/20% extra charge on top of their already expensive menu makes it weirdly pricey.

Andre's Kitchen, when it was at the gas station, had a few good things but I got a taco there right before they moved and it was dry as hell. I asked the dude for some sauce and he pointed to the ketchup... But it was a gas station place so I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. Not sure how Mercado is - need to give it a shot.

Yamas is pretty good.

Chiquillas and El Sombrero are both good, Sombrero I think is a bit more expensive. I need to try Grandma's Kitchen. Mi Pueblito and Yungapeti are both okay for cheap, order-at-the-counter taco spots.

Walla Walla Sub Shop and Tony's Sub Shop seem similar to me -  both pretty good but I don't care for their hoagie bread. It's way too soft and doughy; there is no crust at all on the bread.

Sheri's made me sick once and I haven't tried Clarette's. Mr Ed's isn't exactly gourmet dining but it gets the job done and we go there once in a while for burgers. 

I don't care for any of the chain restaurants.",t2_38w18rxz,Zack_Wolf_,0,1639156591.0,0,t1_ho0bo8d,ho0bo8d,True,ExtraDepartment8796,t3_rd2eyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallawalla/comments/rd2eyk/best_and_worst_places_to_eat_in_walla_walla/,Best and worst places to eat in Walla Walla,/r/wallawalla/comments/rd2eyk/best_and_worst_places_to_eat_in_walla_walla/ho0bo8d/,8,r/wallawalla,0,8

"Exactly.  Some Delivery drivers & porch pirates have to be colluding. Imagine if you will, these thieves are too abrasive about stealing packages off of others properties‚Äô. These thieves are relaxed, fast, & Confident. Not to mention they know, they know! they‚Äôre most likely on camera. 
I‚Äôm not denying that there might be 1% percent of these porch pirates that wake up one day & decide : ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to drive around, God knows for how long, who knows how much gas I‚Äôll have to spend, or if I‚Äôll be putting my life at risk & might get caught by security cameras but Im gonna go steal unattended packages üì¶sounds like an easy way to make money‚Äù. Lol üòÇ 
Most experienced Thieves don‚Äôt think like that. 
These pirates have to be in communication with a delivery driver that either went rogue within the company. Or a delivery driver that INTENTIONALLY APPLIED for such position, to have access to packages & information.
Which makes the most sense. 
Yes there‚Äôs definitely the random homeless dude that might steal a package or two once a year if that, or the typical hooligan neighborhood‚Äôs kids playing a prank on somebody by stealing a package; but that‚Äôs not the case in the majority of these theft crimes happening here. These porch pirates are something else. They‚Äôre organized.

"Hello! A friend and I are looking for 3-5 players to join us in a one-shot D&D 5E campaign. No experience required; new and veteran players welcome! Our long-term goal is to start a group that can meet weekly at Digital Heroes in Downtown Walla Walla or possibly at the WW Public Library. But for now, this one-shot will be run virtually over [Discord](https://www.discord.com/register)and [Roll20](https://app.roll20.net/create-account) (accounts required, both are free for players). Please let me know if you are interested and I will send you the sign-up link for the campaign through Google Forms.

  
Campaign: Saltwater Staffy  
Players Needed: 3-5  
Ages: 13 minimum, 18+ preferred  
Experience Level: Beginner-Veteran  
Campaign Duration: Two 3-hour game sessions  
Availability: Mon., Tues., Wed.  
Start Dates: Dec 6th-8th

  
Description:  
This is a campy, spooky-themed adventure for all ages written using D&D 5th Edition rules. This one-shot adventure will take place over two 3-hour game sessions starting next week! This will be catered towards new players and will be a great opportunity to try D&D for the first time, make some new friends, and hopefully make plans for a future in-person campaign in our area. No prior experience with D&D is required. A computer or laptop with a headset/microphone is recommended. Most modern computers (PC/Mac/Chromebook/Surface/etc.) should work fine as long as you can run a web browser (DM me for any technical questions). If you're interested, please DM me for the sign-up link or if you have any specific questions that I can help with.

"The average home price in WW is around 380K, you might want to look at neighboring towns like Waitsburg, Dayton, Milton Freewater or Prescott.

"My husband and I are also new to town. We‚Äôve found a handful of community hookups so far, maybe some of these would be up your alley!

I‚Äôm not sure what kind of arts and crafts you‚Äôd be interested in, but there are some beginning knitting classes through Purl2 downtown, and they meet on Saturdays in the little park near the shop to knit and hang out together (when it isn‚Äôt too hot). You can check them out on Instagram for event info. 

There is a swing dance club that meets Saturday nights at the gazebo in Pioneer Park. I think they‚Äôre from WWU, but all are welcome and it‚Äôs free. They have a Facebook page for event info. I hear there‚Äôs a better dance scene in the Tri-Cities, but this is a good way to meet some locals. It‚Äôll probably pick up speed again when the college kids come back in the fall, right now it‚Äôs like 10 people. 

We also have enjoyed there farmer‚Äôs markets! There‚Äôs a small one in College Place on Thursdays 4-7 pm, we‚Äôve met some really cool vendors. The larger one is in Walla Walla on Saturdays, I think like 9 am until 1 pm? I‚Äôd have to check that one. Definitely busier with more vendors though. 

If you‚Äôre less of a wine person and more of a craft beer person, we like Dragon‚Äôs Gate and Water Buffalo. The latter sells exclusively at farmer‚Äôs markets. Both have super cool owners.

"I‚Äôm new in town, 25F, but from what I‚Äôve gathered I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm here instead of the Tri-Cities. It seems pretty industrial over there, lots of businesses. Even the residential areas, sports complexes, etc all seemed like big developments. It also feels too busy and too much like a desert for my liking. 

Walla Walla is cute, but very much geared toward tourists with the whole downtown strip. They really push supporting local businesses, which is cool, but I‚Äôve been told they tend to take it a bit too far by favoring locals over out-of-towners, so future job hunts might be a bit tougher (haven‚Äôt experienced it myself yet). I can see how it would be difficult to make friends and date here, but it always just comes down to putting yourself out there, maybe checking out community events to meet people. The busy wineries aren‚Äôt my thing, but there are farmer‚Äôs markets, lots of cute shops, breweries, community events, and more for those of us wanting a different scene. Even some college events are open to the public and are neat to check out.

The logic is that glass is made from sand and energy.  The energy has to be re-created to reuse the glass, and sand isn't rare.

"As a recent transplant from what I thought was a higher cost of living environment, I was really shocked to see the housing prices in WW.

I felt that there was nothing I wanted to live in below the $600K level.  Everything in the $300K range seems like crappy fixer uppers.  $200K buys you meth neighborhood and poverty homes.

We came here thinking we would buy.  We ended up renting from Windermere, like so many others.  That's its own topic.  Not impressed with Windermere, but they are effectively the only game in town. 

We came in to get into the wine industry, and it has been fun.  We'll work a year or two more, and then move on. 

I'm glad I am married.  WW would be destitute if I were trying to find someone.  There are a couple of good restaurants by city standards, but they are overpriced.  Great produce and wine available, moreso if you work in the industry for discounts.  It's a great place for farm to table cooking, with the farms and Foodscape.

It isn't surprising that the dating pool can be somewhat limited. In small towns, locals tend to get married and have children young. They also tend to be heavily religious and ""conservative"". However, W2 has something other small towns do not - a growing and diversifying population. W2 has a much more left-leaning core given it's large college population and transplants from larger metros such as Seattle and Portland.

"I‚Äôm 55, from Seattle. I went to Whitman College and went back to Seattle when I graduated, but always had a fondness for Walla Walla. I moved back 10 years ago. Divorced and remarried, raising my kids and an extended family. Life is better in a small town. I‚Äôm ex-Microsoft and often my commute was 90 minutes. That‚Äôs not the way I want to spend my days. I sell real estate and the market is crazy here too, but still far less expensive than Seattle or Portland. Living here with remote work and remote pay would be awesome. For services and goods we have some shopping, but not everything.  We try to stay local but rely on Amazon a lot, and the Tri-Cities are only an hour away which, for us, means Target, REI, and a Benjamin Moore paint store).  If we need to go to a bigger city (for IKEA) we go to Portland. It‚Äôs an easier drive than Seattle. The wine element is pretty fun. And when friends come to visit you get more quality time in a couple days than you might in months in a bigger city. I imagine it could be a tough place to be single. It depends on how outgoing you are, and things are starting to open up. It‚Äôs too conservative for my liking, but we have a lot of like-minded friends.

"I gave general directions. I guess you‚Äôll know you‚Äôre in the area when your spidy senses tingle. It‚Äôs the feeling when you‚Äôre in a dark alley at 3:00 am, and you sense a threat may be near. It‚Äôs a hypersensitivity or awareness that most ppl don‚Äôt have. I was sober at the time, but a bowl or some acid will definitely make you more susceptible to the subtle energy field. 

I highly advise not doing it though. Go to Sedona.  In the Village of Oak Creek you can have a better time at Cathedral Rock or Bell Rock. If you‚Äôre not familiar with those, give it a google. My moms back yard was Bell Rock. She moved to Dayton last year, so I don‚Äôt spend the Winter there anymore. I mean, if you like that stuff, definitely go. Check out Flag, and spend a few days hiking down to Bright Angel. You‚Äôll have a better time, trust me on that. If you want a guide in to the paranormal, I‚Äôd be that guy. Also, a must visit is Jerome, AZ. There‚Äôs a couple of ghost that haunt the abandoned hotel. Tons of fun!

"> We have a significant gang problem considering the size of the town. 

Can‚Äôt argue with that. From my experience with dealing with criminals, you‚Äôve got to follow codes and rules of conduct. Don‚Äôt break them, and it‚Äôs a non issue. 

> We have an insane rate of single moms

Shit, that‚Äôs a good thing. I really need to move back. 

> lot of the well of people in town treat the poorer people like shit,

Not my family. My pops is retired and spends his energy counseling ex-cons, helps at St Vinnies, and of course donate stupid amounts of money. He buys me a pizza for my birthday, and maybe a $50 gas card. 

> our food really really isn't that good,

I don‚Äôt know how to respond to that. 

> tons of religious snobs

There‚Äôs a church on every corner ( exaggeration of course).  It‚Äôs what makes ppl have a sense of belonging and community. I see it as a good thing. 

> mediocre public schools

HA! move to Idaho and tell me that!
I‚Äôve been to private and public. They‚Äôre both great.

> tons of drug issues (and its not just the homeless)

The only issue is heron and meth. Which is evil shit and a problem everywhere. Now coke, weed, and psychedelics. When a market is flooded, prices drop. Which is another good thing. 

> people in general are not friendly.

The wine industry has brought many transplants in the last 20 years. I despise entitled, elitist, and judgmental people. My point, was the locals are some of the best people I‚Äôve ever met.

"I guess we have different definitions of classy. I‚Äôve been around the block. Spent time in other countries and lived in two world class resort destinations. Wealth does not equal classy. WW per capita has it all. It‚Äôs very diverse religion wise, has excellent educational options, stellar wine, onions, apples, wheat, etc., beautiful as all get out, great cuisine, clean downtown, a police department that actually serves the community ( and that‚Äôs huge for me, I hate cops),  and the friendliest place that I know of. I don‚Äôt know if you realize this, but WW has a vey high percentage of millionaires per capita too. The thing is, you‚Äôd never know because they don‚Äôt show their wealth. My family falls in the latter category. We ( my great grandfather) settled State Line in the late 1880‚Äôs. Immigrants from Italy. We still have land that produces apples and wine to this day. My family is the most humble, down to earth, and classy people I know. And all their friends, and neighbors etc...Next door millionaire types. And they are EVERYWHERE. Not trying to flex, just telling you from my perspective. 

Stay classy WW

"There's a section of the Lewis and Clark trail between [Hat Rock State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=12) and [McNary Beach Recreation Area](https://www.nww.usace.army.mil/Missions/Recreation/McNary-Dam-and-Lake-Wallula/McNary-Beach-Park/) in Oregon that might meet your request. Both ends are open for day use to the public at the moment but best to check the day you go. You can park at either end and walk. It's a gravel trail that runs along the Columbia. It doesn't get right on the river, but it's a nice view of it and I know you can park/ picnic at the Recreation area for free (it's closer to me so I start from there). It is hot though, wear a hat and sunscreen and bring plenty of water; not a lot of trees. Bring binoculars to watch for wildlife.

There's also a national forest area between you and Clarkston with little streams though not actual trails. And the LC valley there has some spots to go along the Snake River, especially if you head south towards Anatone.
