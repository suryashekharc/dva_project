"I live in Morgan Hill and there are so many of us that still half fear coming across her body in the weedy outer areas of town. My friend was in the search party and to this day, she has Sierra as her Facebook picture.

My suspicion, however, is that she was trafficked. I don't know WHY I feel this way. I also feel that Garcia Torres was an agent in the whole of it, and he fears for his life. His father, remember, is (was) convicted of sexual assault of a minor, and his early life was terrible. His father has likely come to know a few people in the prison system. Antolin may have a degree of developmental disability. His responses (or lack thereof) to interrogation after his arrest were often bizarre. I cannot find the link for it, but apparently he had written things down while awaiting trial and then flushed it all down the toilet, or something like that. He wrote very briefly to a reporter in 2020, only to say that he was innocent. Its so odd. The only reason I can see for a man who already has a life sentence, but maintains his innocence is that he fears something worse than jail.

When I worked at the East dunne Starbucks she’d sit in our lobby, geeking out & giggling to herself for hours. She took a bite out of our wrapped sandwiches, eating the plastic with it.

When I worked at Trader Joe’s she was banned from there. She’d crack open beer cans, stick her head between the shelfs, & chug them. When she was kicked out one day she ate a handful of cigarette butts as she was walking out for some reason.

"Im 23 (and a half to be exact) and have lived 22 of those years here in Morgan Hill. My family was middle class until ‘08 when my dad was laid off (parents divorced at 4 but were still friendly enough to continue living together until the house foreclosed (i was 13). After my dad spent his life savings trying to keep up with house payments we all stopped living together physically. Nothing was affordable in Morgan Hill, luckily my mom, sisters and I could make it into one of the few low income housing places and have been scraping by since. My dad has been living in a fifth wheel for the pst few years and was renting an overly expensive 2 bedroom for him and my grandma years before. Growing up in morgan hill was alright, as a kid it was do able, but growing up was hard (which im sure is like anywhere else). Theres almost nothing to do in morgan hill, as a kid i ended up trying just a few drugs growing up because there was nothing better to do. If there was anything fun, it was too expensive and my family couldnt afford it, but drugs were affordable. I got a job at 14 to help take of my own needs like going to the movies, or going out for lunch with friends. As a young adult now ive come to see that the town of morgan hill has changed immensely. People are not as positive to each other as they used to be, theres more division than before because all this political party bs, the public school system sucks and cant admit it, police seem to be less caring about the public and more about the belt used to lay down the law (with some exceptions), people who make mistakes are treated like horrible criminals, and the list goes on. Im sure theres a lot of great things about morgan hill that are hard for me to notice, but sadly in California (especially is Morgan hill nowadays) if you dont have luxury money to enjoy consistently expensive dinners downtown, or after school sports/programs for kids, a day down at the range or even an occasional massage or movie off tennant. At the end of the day, if you can afford to buy a home comfortably in morgan hill, it may be the place for you, otherwise just find somewhere cheaper. Crime has been getting worse over the past 10 years due to small groups of gangs (and wannabes). If you’re coming here to start or continue a family i highly recommend getting into CSMH, best school in MHUSD (technically located in coyote/south san jose). If it wasnt for that school, which i hated at the time, i would be a worse person than i am today or maybe even dead. Good luck coming to morgan hill, sorry for my tales of woe but its just my honest opinion living here for so long. Side note, i lived ‘on my own’ (with 2 roommates in a 3 bedroom) in Vail Colorado and it was the greatest experience of my life. I actually felt like living and not dying. Thats why im so harsh on morgan hill, because i know there are better places elsewhere.

"I used to take Caltrain quite a bit pre-COVID.  A 1 1/2 hour minimum commute on the train vs. 1 1/4+ hour in the car.  I could at least get some work done or read a book instead of staring at the tailpipe ahead of me.  Just before COVID, the train was so jammed, it was tough to find a seat.  I was really surprised they hadn’t increased the number of trains.

The ride would have been a lot shorter if the train schedule and shuttle schedules weren’t so horrible in combination.  There were no express trains to my work that started from below Tamien, and the local trains didn’t connect up with the shuttle bus for my job.

"The company still intends to develop the northern half of the property. But instead of constructing industrial buildings there, it now plans to build a mix of office and commercial space, according to a Trammell Crow news release. The developer expects to submit a proposal to the city for that portion of the property later this year.

The buildings that Trammell Crow and HPA Architecture have designed for Redwood Tech @ 101 range in size from 73,000 to 139,000 square feet. That size, plus the fact that the buildings could be split among two or three companies, ought to make them attractive to local companies in need of expansion space, said Edith Ramirez, Morgan Hill's assistant city manager for development services.

The city's vacancy rate for industrial space currently hovers around 6% with ""very little"" available inventory at the moment, she said.

Ramirez said Monday that she would like to see Trammell Crow incorporate as much office space as allowed by the city's general plan into its proposal for the northern half of the property. Among other things she'd like to see there are an entertainment and event venue like Topgolf, an outdoor gear retailer like Bass Pro Shops, an upscale hotel with restaurant and meeting space, and an arts and recreation center.",t2_4dmy1s5b,mattj8,0,1614302228.0,0,t1_gos12m7,gos12m7,False,mattj8,t3_lry7kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/,"Developer cuts size of planned Morgan Hill industrial park in half, citing community feedback",/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/gos12m7/,2,r/morganhill,0,2
"Trammell Crow purchased the undeveloped site, which is roughly bounded by Cochrane Road to the north, Half Road to the south, De Paul Drive to the east and Highway 101 to the west, in January 2019 for about $30.7 million, according to data from commercial real estate analytics firm Reonomy. Later that year, it submitted plans to the city for an advanced manufacturing business park comprised of three buildings that would offer up to 1.2 million square feet of office and industrial space combined.

Last May, while making its pitch for the project, then dubbed the ""[Morgan Hill Technology Center](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/05/21/public-review-period-underway-morgan-hill-project.html),"" Trammell Crow [said](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/05/21/public-review-period-underway-morgan-hill-project.html) it would generate an estimated $700,000 in total tax revenue for the city and would provide more than 1,000 jobs.

But the project drew opposition from the public almost immediately. At a public hearing on the development in October 2019, about two dozen Morgan Hill residents spoke out against it, some expressing concern that instead of being a tech center, it would be used as a distribution center. Such a use would add to the already heavy traffic along Highway 101 and generate fewer jobs than Trammell Crow was promising, they argued.

Some city residents also formed the [Morgan Hill Responsible Growth Coalition](https://www.mh-rgc.org/) to lobby against the development. After receiving community input on its initial proposal, Trammell Crow reduced the technology center's total size to more than 1.04 million square feet and increased the number of buildings from three to six.

Yet faced with continued opposition, the company last September withdrew its application for the center.",t2_4dmy1s5b,mattj8,0,1614302195.0,0,t1_gos1084,gos1084,False,mattj8,t3_lry7kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/,"Developer cuts size of planned Morgan Hill industrial park in half, citing community feedback",/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/gos1084/,2,r/morganhill,0,2
"In addition to shrinking the total size and scope of the project, now dubbed Redwood Tech @ 101, Trammell Crow also reduced the size and number of buildings it plans to construct. The development is named for a row of mature, 35-foot to 40-foot-tall redwood trees Trammell Crow has incorporated into its design, the company said in a Feb. 18 news release.

The developer now proposes to erect five Class A industrial buildings on the property. Each of those could either be leased by one tenant or split between two or three, according to a news release by Trammell Crow and the city of Morgan Hill's website.",t2_4dmy1s5b,mattj8,0,1614302185.0,0,t1_gos0zgp,gos0zgp,False,mattj8,t3_lry7kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/,"Developer cuts size of planned Morgan Hill industrial park in half, citing community feedback",/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/gos0zgp/,2,r/morganhill,0,2
"Happy to, u/MBThree. Sorry for the delay in sharing. Here are some snippets I think may be of interest to this subreddit:

Trammell Crow Company has cut in half the size of a planned industrial park for Morgan Hill after pushback from city residents.

The Texas-based developer now plans to build [501,314 square feet](http://www.morgan-hill.ca.gov/2128/Redwood-Tech-at-101) of light industrial space on the southern half of the 60 acres it owns in the northeast part of the city, according to a proposal it submitted last week. Previously, the company had submitted — then withdrew — plans to build more than 1 million square feet of space that would have covered nearly the entire site.

There was ""clear disinterest"" in the community to have industrial space on the northern half of the property, Don Little, senior vice president of development at Trammell Crow's Northern California Business Unit, said in an email Monday.

The revised proposal reflects ""substantial input from city leadership, planners, Morgan Hill residents, local business leaders, and other civic-minded individuals,"" Trammell Crow said on the [project's website](https://redwoodtech101.com/).",t2_4dmy1s5b,mattj8,0,1614302157.0,0,t1_gos0xfi,gos0xfi,False,mattj8,t3_lry7kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/,"Developer cuts size of planned Morgan Hill industrial park in half, citing community feedback",/r/morganhill/comments/lry7kj/developer_cuts_size_of_planned_morgan_hill/gos0xfi/,2,r/morganhill,0,2

"There was a virtual town hall meeting last night, and it really depends on your area. When asked about the neighborhood by Target (Cochrane and Mission View), the response wasn’t that it was highly unlikely that that neighborhood would be in the yellow, even though it’s right up against the line now. A similar answer was given to people that live on the west side of Hill Road, again right on the other side of the yellow line. 

If you look at where they placed the line, it pretty much divides Morgan Hill proper from the more woodsy, harder to evacuate areas. It seems like the line isn’t going to keep inching towards your house, it was placed where it was for a reason.

"Yes. And? The flag as a symbol being coopted by the extreme right is true. People who love their country fly flags as well. That’s true too. Both things are not mutually exclusive. It sounded like you were implying that all those far right people flying flags are ONLY doing so because they love their country. The original point was that many (I can’t say all) of the far right extremist fringe are flying the American flag as a statement of nationalism and white supremacy, and for a heritage and a history of some views that many find antithetical to values most Americans share today. That is why when people see groups of the far right, proud boys, etc, flying American flags alongside Nazi and Confederate flags, the impression is less the “give us your huddled masses..land of immigrants..inclusive melting pot..” kind of America, and more “whites only” kind of heritage.

Your statement is stupid, why would you have an issue with your country flag? Are you 15? Seriously are you a legal adult?

So childish and petty your statement is
- Yoda

You live in United States of America, you have taken benefits of the freedom achieved by its veterans, the prospect economy, abundant food, democracy, human rights and opportunities. That you want to say some people are hungry, well we all have to do what we all have to do to survive, but this ain't China, Russian, Haiti or even Africa, this is not a third world country, in a third world country you would be killed for asking what you have the freedom to ask here.

Stop being so emotional because that fogs your logic. United States is where you live, the country isn't bad, the government would be the one to blame not the land.

If you still hate it and want to burn some flags then be accountable, have disciple and stand your ground by leading by example and gttf out of the country.",t2_ckrwe4l,michivideos,0,1597593080.0,0,t1_g1qtb6x,g1qtb6x,True,[deleted],t3_i1qagx,https://www.reddit.com/r/morganhill/comments/i1qagx/anybody_annoyed_by_all_the_american_flags/,Anybody annoyed by all the American flags everywhere?

"Hey sorry for the very late reply to this. But, I currently am a student to Foothill Community college (sister school of De Anza), the amount of time it takes me to drive from MH to Foothill is about 1- 1 1/2 hours in the morning if there is traffic being. 6am-10am. For De Anza it's about 45-1hr 15 min.  Now if you are taking classes in the afternoon-evening, driving there would take you about 30 min. Now the problem is driving back. at 3pm-7pm there will be traffic. Maybe about an hour to drive back home. 

I'm not a big fan of De Anza because there are so many students there and I would suggest parking all the way in the back because I have seen a lot of hit and runs in the parking lots when I was taking a language class. But, it is a good community college same with Foothill. If you can, I would very strongly suggest taking online classes.

"Definitely head over to the coast. Hit up a beach for a few hours (tons of great choices) if that’s your jam. Monterey Bay Aquarium is a fun day trip but can be a bit pricey. The wharf is fun to wander around at and there is a nice beach there to enjoy for a bit. 17 Mile Drive is gorgeous also if you’re headed that way to the coast.

San Francisco is another great day trip. See the bridge obviously, check out the shops at Pier 39, wander around a bit. Stop into Ghirardellis for sure if you like chocolate and sweets. Tons of other things to do there - I haven’t been in years except for baseball games so I can’t think what else off the top of my head.

In Morgan Hill specifically I do enjoy Trail Dust BBQ - I agree with above that it can be noisy but I usually take it to go. There are some nice parks you could drop into for a picnic lunch - the park at the base of Anderson Damn is really nice (off Cochrane, head East past Target and it’s on your left).

"I can’t speak to Cupertino specifically but to Sunnyvale it can be up to 1.5 hours at peak rush hour if you can’t use HOV. If your company provides a bus, definitely use it as it hugely reduces the stress associated with the commute. Most of the buses have WiFi as well so you can definitely do some work while commuting.

We do have CalTrain which some folks use but the return times can be somewhat awkward. You’d have to leave before 4 to make it worth riding it, plus it’s more expensive than driving or taking a commuter bus.

All that said I love it down here. It’s a very nice town for families, it’s quiet and has really nice downtown for dining. It has lots of events as well.

"I commuted for years (I WFH now).  Solo driver on major freeways, depending on when you leave, it can take an hour to an hour and a half.  If you leave around 9am, it's definitely better, but will still probably average 45 minutes (mostly because valley traffic will still be bad).  Probably around the same back, if you leave at 4pm.  

There are lots of back roads that people take as well, that can cut some time off of your commute, but not a ton.  Also, depending on what company you work for, there are lots of shuttles that stop in MH and Gilroy (I personally know Apple and Google both have commuter buses that regularly come down here during the mornings and afternoons).  I worked for Apple, and the commute bus from MH to the Sunnyvale offices was usually around an hour, but I didn't have to drive AND the bus had Wi-fi.

"Hey their friend, so far MG has been awesome and pretty much an easy transition from life in a lower populated area (spokane). I really enjoy the low key downtown area and there seems to be plenty of parks and stuff for the kids to do. It is also much more affordable to live since I have a larger family. We do most of our chopping in Gilroy, but that is just because safeway's prices are often too damn high! We are still exploring, but so far it is nice. Plus I love beer and the running shop and hops is a pretty legit.
