Got on the bus/train for the first time since Covid started and my experience went like this:

63: Double length bus, myself and other passengers. Next stop? Some guy hacking and wheezing comes all the way to the back of the wide open bus and sits down RIGHT BESIDE ME/partway on my leg.

Throw my bag immediately over the seat and move three rows up. I think ""As fucking if this is my first experience"".

Then I get on the Line 1. 4 people around me without masks, 1 coughing and wheezing and another messily digging his face into a muffin and coffee.

My next two busses thankfully were okay. The entire first half of my trip made me livid however and I showered immediately when I got to my destination and changed clothes.

"You need to listen to experts in this. (Emphasis added is mine)

>However, the problematic impacts of this hunger-focused story go beyond omission and limit the range of acceptable — and politically feasible — solutions, explained Elaine Power, professor of food and gender studies at Queen’s University.

Among the solutions that aren’t considered politically feasible is the implementation of adequate social supports. Those could include a universal basic income, she said — and that would mean increasing taxes, particularly for corporations and the wealthiest Canadians, to fund the system.

There is precedent in Canada for an income-based approach to poverty and hunger reduction. In fact, the first food bank in Canada wasn’t established until 1981, in Edmonton. The country was in recession at the time, driving a surge of poverty, and the organization was created as a temporary emergency measure modelled off food banks in the United States.

But when the economy picked up again, the social services that had helped alleviate poverty in Canada created after the Depression and the Second World War were never restored or adequately replaced. Instead, food banks and charities were left to fill in the cracks in Canadian society by keeping people fed, Power said.

>At the heart of the U.S. food charity model, now widespread in Canada, is a tight relationship between food producers — **who, by design, produce more than they can sell** — and the charities tasked with feeding hungry people, she said. It is literal, because ""*many food charities rely on donations of cash and excess food, but the relationship also shaped the range of morally acceptable responses to both hunger and food waste.**

About 86 per cent of food waste in Canada is generated in the supply chain before it reaches consumers, according to a 2019 report by Second Harvest, a non-profit organization that recuperates food that would otherwise be wasted and distributes it to charities.

>“(Donating food to charities) is so simple, so immediate, it feels morally good,” said Power, and not just because the donation will help alleviate hunger. “It’s also morally good in the sense of not wasting food, and now we have this … other green moral imperative.”

This approach is widespread in federal and provincial responses to hunger. For instance, since April, the federal government has announced $250 million in grants to help food charities purchase and distribute food, redirect food that would have otherwise been wasted to food charities and hire temporary help to replace volunteers.

>And while this charity-based approach is necessary to meet Canadians’ immediate needs for food, Power said that it needs to remain an emergency measure.

“(Food charities) serve too many purposes. They allow food companies to get rid of surpluses or things that couldn’t sell and be good corporate citizens. They allow workplaces to use volunteering as a kind of team-building. Even my kids, starting in junior kindergarten, they learn that this is how you be a good person — you bring food to the food bank,” she said.

Food charities shouldn’t be normal or institutionalized — advocating for adequate wages and income supports and demanding that large food producers, processors and grocers stop wasting 8.8 million tonnes of food annually should, she said.

Tarasuk agreed, saying it is **not the public’s responsibility to alleviate hunger. It’s the government’s** — and donating millions to charities isn’t enough, she added.

"So 'debating' this online is a fools game imo. In the end, I think the protest should have been handled and presented differently. Outside of the 'fed bubble' downtown, many Canadians are livid at how trudeau has run this country over the last few terms. Gross incompetence, reckless spending, hypocrisy with no bounds and now we are rewarded with run-away inflation, out of control house price, more taxes, continued fed vax mandates, money fleeing etc. People are pissed off and your average fed employee ""working from home"" is completely blind to this. The CBC doesn't report it, so how would they know this until a group of loud, obnoxious truckers rolls into town. 

The media and gov used the protest and covid to divide people and communities and this was so obvious during the protest. From what I have read there was very little trouble during the protest, crime was down in the core over the 3 weeks and generally it was a very peaceful protest (annoying yes, but not violent). I checked it out on two weekends and was amazed at the diversity of people, genders (lots of lgbt flags) and backgrounds. Many people from Eastern Europe and the Mid East, Africa were there because they have lived through REAL oppression and communism and see how the country is adopting some of these mantras and sliding down this path (they are aware that is always a slow boil, your rights taken  away one at a time - and of course always for your own good).  

Even the language used on this thread. ""Terrorism"" ""Occupation"" ""Survivor"" etc is a juvenile attempt to trump up their victimhood on the back of those who have actually lived these experiences. 

Finally, why would you ever want to hand over your bodily autonomy to pharmaceutical companies and the government? What good could ever come of that, especially when these companies are immune to any legal repercussions? These are the same companies that have been tried and convicted in the past of criminal (not civil) charges for pushing and lying about their products that have killed ten of thousands of people in the past (opiodes as just one example) . Why would you want to give that power over to these companies? Because once it is gone, you are not getting it back. Were you really that afraid of covid (with it's 99.7% survivability for those healthy) that you were going to sell the whole farm? 

Final final thought....think long term here. The power you have handed over to the government/pharma the last two years may not seem like a big deal to you with someone like Trudeau or Biden in power BUT what happens if Trump or Trump 2.0 gets elected again. How would you like someone like Trump having complete control over what you put in your body, where you can go, whether you can travel within your country, when and where you can protest, take a drug he demands or no job etc. I am pretty sure you and all the other 'anti protest' 'pro vax' types would/will lose your collective sh\*t when that happens. And don't think it won't happen (it already happened once)!

Anyway, not sure if that answered any of your questions.

"It’s sad that people have to go “the extra mile” to ensure people are treated well.

We ordered pizza last night. When our order arrived I tipped like usual (in addition to the delivery fee) and discovered when we got to the kitchen the order was wrong.

First time it’s ever happened, not the end of the world but meant there wasn’t pizza for my daughter.

I called the company, they apologized and said they’d send a replacement out.

But generally drivers get paid their delivery fee - by the customer - as a charge on an item - so they don’t get paid again for a free replacement.  So I made sure to tip him a bit more.  Should I have had to do this? No.  Why should I have to pay an extra $5 for a replacement item on my order? I shouldn’t, obviously.

But neither should the driver have to be providing my replacement for free. He’s paying gas, it’s not just extra work without paying it would literally cost him.

"But they don't work. For real.

>Canada had ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in 1976, which included recognition of the right to food. Our economic, social and cultural rights were supposedly protected by a European-style welfare state with universal health care, family allowances, pensions, employment insurance and provincial social assistance programs.

But people were still depending on charities for food.

Today corporate-backed food banking functions as B.C.’s parallel food charity economy. Its symbiotic tango with social assistance guarantees sub-poverty level welfare benefits while daily undermining human rights.

Yet public and political support is strong. As COVID-19 strikes, food bank donations pour in. Walmart ads celebrating its contributions flood our screens; Ottawa allocates $50 million to food banks across Canada; Victoria contributes another $3 million; even the proceeds of Dr. Bonnie Henry’s “limited edition” and brand-promoting Fluevog shoes, designed to recognize B.C.’s public health leader, are food-bank bound. Yes, we must do whatever it takes.

Little wonder at the community outrage created by the Greater Vancouver Food Bank’s pre-pandemic decision to increase admission eligibility by requiring additional pieces of paper ID for those seeking a bite to eat.

A petition by food bank supporters, anti-poverty activists and academics demanded its retraction. The decision was halted, but personal information is still being requested on a voluntary basis, even during the pandemic.

If we are all in this together, why not trust all food bank applicants, as the federal government is doing for those applying for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit? That would be a small step toward inclusiveness and away from the divisiveness of cataloguing the “deserving and undeserving” poor.

https://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2020/04/22/Food-Banks-Prop-Broken-System/


>Results

The majority of people who were food insecure at baseline remained food insecure at the 18-month follow-up, although there was a small downward trend in the proportion of people in the severely food insecure category. Conversely, there was a small but significant increase in the mean perceived mental health score at the 18-month follow-up compared to baseline. We found significant reductions in food insecurity for people who accessed food banks that offered a Choice model of food distribution and food banks that were integrated within Community Resource Centres.

Conclusions

Food banks offer some relief of food insecurity but they don’t eliminate the problem. In this study, reductions in food insecurity were associated with food banks that offered a Choice model and those that were integrated within a Community Resource Centre. There was a slight improvement in perceived mental health at the 18-month time point; however, moderately and severely food insecure participants still had much lower perceived mental health than the general population.

>Canadians have an enshrined right to food, but our government contorts food into a gift to those living with food insecurity. This corporatized approach to charity ignores the blatant creation of food insecurity along lines of race, Indigeneity, gender, parenting and relationship status, housing status, precarious labour and social assistance participation. But more than this, the approach simply doesn’t work.

In fact, after nearly 40 years of food banks, an unprecedented 4.5 million people were still food insecure pre-pandemic. At the same time, corporate grocery retail profits have flourished, partly with help from the federal government. What’s more, the concentration of market share of the big three grocery retailers — Loblaws, Sobeys and Metro — rose to at least 80 per cent.

>Continuing to promote this corporatized response to Canada’s persistent food insecurity emergency during the pandemic hasn’t changed a thing. Statistics Canada found food insecurity increased during the first wave of the pandemic, while at the same time grocery retail profits soared.

"Here is my take - how strongly are you willing to hold yourself to getting A's and what do you actually want to learn.

Algonquin is a fantastic option if you just want to code and get a bunch of practical experience doing so. It will lead to jobs so long as you stay at the top of your class. This will get you a good placement to get some experience and from there you will be hirable across a lot of the industry. The danger here is you don't maintain the grades and get a mediocre placement - that will make it harder to springboard forward.

UofO is a better program than Carleton, but UofO has terrible administration. The end result of a degree between either is similar opportunities. Employers will not really care between the difference - if you didn't go to Waterloo, U of T or other top 50 world ranking, then the difference doesn't really matter.

University computer science has a much stronger math component though because it leads to Masters and Doctoral programs where you are working more in the ""science"" area of Computer Science - that is: developing and evaluating new theories around making all elements of computing more efficient or able to tackle greater problems. This would be a must if you want to get hired into some of the biggest companies - especially if you think you would be working in Algorithm development or Machine Learning. You will definitely be doing math courses and having to do some programming portfolio building on the side.

However, C's get Degrees means a CS degree with any grade will probably take you further than a college degree with similar grades because College is all about getting a good placement. For university, you will also benefit from co-op which requires good grades, but plenty of people without co-op get hired.",t2_33ogrh2s,Lostinthestarscape,0,1648997418.0,0,t1_i388uy7,i388uy7,True,tadlrs,t3_tvada2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/tvada2/whats_the_best_collegeuniversity_in_ottawa/,What’s the best college/university in Ottawa?,/r/ottawa/comments/tvada2/whats_the_best_collegeuniversity_in_ottawa/i388uy7/,3,r/ottawa,0,3

"Here are a couple of website's ranking universities in Canada. Both have Ottawa U ahead of Carleton. Algonquin tends to have a more hands on approach to learning. 

University degrees give more of a chance to move up but a lot of workplaces like ahving the hands on knowledge provided by college. 

My personal experience with college and university is that college is more of a weekly grind where you have assignments due weekly while university gives you more control over how you organize your learning experience. Though this is in more the social sciences field, I've heard the same about other programs as well. 

It really depends on what you're looking for, and what works for you right now. And remember that there is always an option to go back in the future if you need/want a change in scenery/progression/field. 

Good luck on your educational journey.

"Congratulations! I too have joined the sober movement. I got tired of the push and pull of temptation and resistance and the effect of alcohol on my stomach. I do like to join in with others in having a special drink at events or to unwind in the evening. I don't much care for beer with or without alcohol but I have found some nice wines that are dealcoholized. You can make spritzers and mocktails with them or have them straight. I will share details below. However, to answer your question about mocktails: Jacobson's on Beechwood sells some non-alcoholic spirits like Ceder's. I make a great mocktail with Ceder's, Ruby Fassionola, and lime Perrier with a twist of orange peel or lemon peel - delicious. Guests who are designated drivers or having a dry night love it too. My favourite dealcoholized wines to date are: Rotkappchen sparkling rosé (my whole family loves it) it is drier than most no alcohol wines; St Regis wines are also pretty good, especially the chardonnay and rosé, I came to like the cabernet sauvignon over time but it is an acquired taste. All these wines are available at the Metro grocery store on Merivale Road at Viewmount, but the supply is hit and miss so you may have to try more than once to get what you want. Best wishes and stay strong. On a previous occasion when I gave up alcohol, a friend told me I was more fun when I was drinking. That person is no longer my friend. Don't let anyone discourage you from your route to wellness. Eventually the urge to consume alcohol declines to a whisper. I am having a great time concocting mocktails for my entertainment and the enjoyment of friends and family - alcohol is not required.",t2_9ffbwnck,AdditionalUmpire5372,0,1648991561.0,0,t1_i37x0vo,i37x0vo,True,Andromache5,t3_rm604q,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/rm604q/where_can_i_buy_nonalcoholic_spirits/,Where can I buy nonalcoholic spirits?,/r/ottawa/comments/rm604q/where_can_i_buy_nonalcoholic_spirits/i37x0vo/,2,r/ottawa,0,2

my rent is $426 but i only got in bc the girls had an opening in their house they had been renting for the past 3 years. same with my house before that, my rent there was $495 but it was a house that had been rented out by members of a sorority for the past 10 years or something. both are 4 bedroom, one was 2 stories and the other was 3 stories.

both landlords are very very very old like 95+...not sure if that had something to do with it or not. i think the rent was so cheap bc the houses were already paid off and the landlords were already retired.

"I’m actually in the middle of applying to be a foster parent so I can kind of answer some questions.

First off in general the agencies usually try to keep kids in their general areas so they can stay in their regular school and whatnot. Since you are in Ottawa it’s possible they don’t know you exist. 

The goal is always reuniting the family but that isn’t always possible. In Ottawa there is a limit on the number of days a kid can be in care before the agency has to start looking at more permanent solutions like parents surrendering custody or permanent placement with a family member. 

I don’t know how much the agencies talk to each other but I would suspect that the provincial border is probably part of the issue. 

You can always call up the agency and explain the situation. If you want to be a caregiver or respite home for a relative I think you still need to go through the background checks and home checks and have an appropriate bedroom and whatnot for the kid.

Interviews with family can also help the agency to get a better idea of background info. Also knowing that family members can help support birth parents can make it easier to get kids back with their families.",t2_70zbktlt,Ikkleknitter,0,1648951316.0,0,t1_i3697ma,i3697ma,True,[deleted],t3_tuo137,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/tuo137/family_of_children_put_into_foster_care/,family of children put into foster care,/r/ottawa/comments/tuo137/family_of_children_put_into_foster_care/i3697ma/,3,r/ottawa,0,3

There's a shortage of apartments, especially for renters with lower incomes. (But, alas, paying low rents into infinity won't create an incentive for anyone to build new apartment buildings though.)

Lots of professionals in Ottawa want to rent nowadays. Detached houses are out of the reach of even a lot of single middle class people with decent jobs, and they can afford a relatively high rent to live in the city centre. This puts a further squeeze on anyone with a limited income. However, the middle class renters have to live somewhere too.

The answer is to get more apartment buildings built.",t2_l52qj2kv,Brillo_Box,0,1648944281.0,0,t1_i362e30,i362e30,False,25koala,t3_tust46,https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/tust46/rent_above_listed_price/,Rent above listed price,/r/ottawa/comments/tust46/rent_above_listed_price/i362e30/,-2,r/ottawa,0,-2

"I'm sure that some barber shops would have no problem with that, but unfortunately queerphobia and transphobia is still quite prevalent, especially in businesses like barber shops that are traditionally very male-centric. As someone who is assigned female at birth but prefers to present more nonbinary/masculine, I'm not necessarily comfortable going into any old barber shop and asking for a men's haircut because I may face sexism, stigma, and not get what I came for. A queer-friendly hair salon would be much more likely to understand what I want, and to help me look my best without any internalized stigma or judgment.

"If your heart is set on that specific place and you can shell out the extra rent then I say go for it. Only you know what makes the place worth it to you. (Location, unit extras, building perks, etc.)

The rental vacancies have been a roller coaster in Ottawa over the past few years. It was extremely tight before COVID hit, and yes, there were lines of prospective renters showing up to view vacant apartments, the vacancy rate was incredibly low, people were offering above listing (anecdotally, no idea how common it was). I remember students looking for places at the last minute and being completely desperate.

With COVID people weren't moving and uni students weren't coming to the city so vacancies grew.

It doesn't surprise me that vacancies are now dwindling. So do what makes sense to you.

Yeah this is you trying to ""spin"" your own narrative.



""The fact seem to be..."".hmmm, that's spin. You're making a conclusion. You're saying this is how to think about the facts.  

If the public reacts to something completely wrong, and I go on the air to switch it towards reality, that's also spin.  The news is not creating all the narratives.  Its responding to the public, nailing down facts and views, assembling them into some temporary picture...because it's a daily journalism, it's just a snapshot.   Because this is an assemblance of various things.  It's too messy to be propaganda.

They make an assessment based on what you write re: why you're seeking health care, and if they determine they cannot help you online, they do NOT charge you. they can prescribe, and give primary care provider notes for missed school/work etc.
