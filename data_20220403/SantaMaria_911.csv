"Orcutt is best place to live.

Santa Maria itself.... not that great. But it is a great commuter town for places to visit

We have all the box stores that you could want. Nothing unique but at least everything youre going to need is here and close by. No night life in the city.

Mexican food is good. Aside from that alternate options are lacking. Some hit and miss spots here and there but overall this is not a foodie town. 

We have amazing local wineries (start with presquille, riverbench, zaca mesa, and expand from there)

We have a lot of hiking close by. I did willow creek hike today. It was a great hike! Point Sal is the classic local hike but there is a lot to explore

Close enough to SLO and santa barbara for a day trip.

Beach bonfires at Grover Beach are a good time. I park at fins restaurant use a wheelbarrow to wheel all the wood and stuff in.

Morro bay seafood is awesome and kayaking (bring own or rent) is fun there. Montana de oro state park has cool stuff. On the main trail there is an area you can hike down to tide pools which is fun if you time low tide right.

Cambria is my favorite beach town. Moonstone beach in cambria is my favorite beach in the area.

Yosemite is 3-4hrs away as is sequoia and Joshue Tree. Death valley probably 5-6hrs. Pinnacles national park is about 2ish hours drive and a really cool 8-10 mile hike with splunking and califonia condors. I have not made it out to the channel islands yet but its on my bucketlist.

Big sur is always a good time and I usually stay overnight in monterey when I head that way.

THat should get you started. Yeah Santa Maria kinda sucks. Its just a lame town to be honest. But everything around it is pretty awesome.

"I've been looking at studios/1 bedrooms in SM for the past few months. You're going to have to be checking all the apartment search sites (or set notifications when things get posted), check FB marketplace, check craigslist (90% of posts are scams), or drive around looking for something every day. A piece of advice I got when I was looking at apartment complexes was to check the actual apartment site for available units (if they even post) on a regular basis, since those apartments get posted to the search engines sites later. There are also a few property management sites with rental units in SM; they have been getting flooded with applications and so you will have to check those sites on a regular basis too (Hacienda Oaks, Searchlight Digs, etc.). You can also call around at apartment complexes to get waitlisted.

I ended up finding a place in SLO - there are a good amount of 1 bedrooms/studios up there.

exactly. benefit bbqs or just follow the oak smoke with your nose. i only mentioned firestone because its popular. so yea it is over rated but they did a good job of marketing the sandwich. someone here local should step up.

I haven't been to Shaw's since they reopened, but they didn't have tritip before (same with The Swiss and Hitching Post). 

If you want good tri-tip, hit up a charity BBQ on the weekend - that's where you'll find it.

"Sm itself is pretty barebones and not too pretty. Just your average large town/ small city activities.  

The real good news is that you're right in the middle of everywhere AND you have the best weather in California (almost always comfortably sunny year round) 

If you have a car you're only 2-3 hours away from the bay area and LA areas.  You also have the national parks pretty close as well.  So essentially if u have a free weekend there is a ton of stuff to do.  More locally you have the beach 15 minutes away (includes dunes), and some semi touristy towns 20-60 minutes away if you want to go out (Santa Barbara and San Luis). There is also a lot of wine tasting and a ton of awesome trails nearby (I like montaña de Oro).  

I think it's nice that sm is small because we get to be in a very good location relatively close to everything without the horrible traffic of big cities.

"Lol yeah I was wondering the same thing. I came from a big city with more nightlife than I can handle and now I'm here and it's just dead. 
I talked to a couple locals at nipomo BBQ and they told me you have to leave SM for any real nightlife. 

The only other place I can think of besides the two you mentioned is Santa Maria brewing Co. 

Pretty cool spot and great BBQ across the street but like the other places mentioned it isn't really a ""nightlife"" spot. Everything closes early... Even the orcutt spots close before or around midnight on the weekends. 

It seems like a lot of new people are moving here from SF, LA, and San Jose because it's the last place you can buy property on the central coast under 600k. The city hasn't really adapted to this yet unfortunately. 

I think Santa Maria needs a nice outdoor promenade like you would find in SLO or LA and SF. I mean there isn't even a decent mall in SM!

"Pretty cool hobbies! I also play a bunch of disc at Waller and would recommend it to someone new to the area. I’ve met some cool peeps and have even expanded on my disc friends group by going up to SLO to play at Sinsheimer too. 

I second the Blast recommendation, really cool place and I would say the best bar + restaurant here in town (at least in my short experience). Naughty Oak is also cool and next to Blast 825, we usually do both in a single night, night cap with Elmer’s if you’re feeling it.

"Rotary Park, also just called Robin Ventura is definitely popular. No lights and with Daylight Savings coming up, no real chance to play after 5. Everyone seems to be playing at Sunrise which is just around the corner and down the street, but it's two basket to basket half courts which blows. But they have lights. I think Saturday and Sunday mornings get pretty good runs. 

Behind the Abel Maldonado Center near the library there's a court with lights. One rim is like 9 1/2 and they have chain nets. The fence is annoying too as balls tend to go over and down into the baseball field. I haven't been there in a long time. It can draw a crowd and there's been groups I've played with there that then ended up in jail for gang shootings so it *can* get a lil different over there. 

There's the halfcourt by the skatepark. There's some decent lighting for play after dak, though it might turn off around 9pm or 10pm. 

There's a handful of random courts throught the city usually as part of a community park, but I've never seen any full games played there. 

I think there's a new park in Nipomo where a bunch of people are showing up to play that is supposedly really nice.

I've been away from pickup too long. Would have loved to start playing regularly but was COVID cautious. Doing a bunch of shooting around in my driveway though.

"As long as we have people such as yourself around here, who deny the cultural issues that put everyone at risk, and the underlying mentality that is really based on selfishness, then the problem will always exist here.  We will always have that underbelly to this city so long as people such as yourself defend it or deny it's existence, there will be no change.  Your denial of it does not make it magically go away.  Your positive perspective doesn't eliminate MS-13, meth, and fentanyl.  Gee, I wonder where that is all coming from?  Gifts from the South.

If the Mexican drug cartels had it their way, I'd be another walking dead tweaker giving them every single dollar I have to get a fix, ruining my life, and going around stealing shit to purchase their product.  Why can't their government do something about that problem that has been going on for decades, oh yeah...corruption on all levels.  Keep waving that flag though, and pretend it's all good.  And you think I am the problem, haha.  You are so naïve.

Recently, Santa Maria had more new cases of Covid than every other city in SB county COMBINED.  Wake up.  This speaks to something deeper than the pandemic, regarding Santa Maria.  It's trash and I can't wait to leave!  This city sucks ass.

"Santa Maria?  Diverse?  Do we live in the same city?  You act like this is New York or something, haha.  Anyways, if they are so proud of Mexico, based on flying their flags here, why don't they go live there?  This is the United States.  Doubtful that their government down south was as generous with the stimulus/unemployement benefits that we were in 2020, maybe show some love to the good old Red, White and Blue.  Go ahead and fly both flags, thats cool.  Why just a Mexican flag?  It's confusing to me on multiple levels.

A few interesting stats from the public health department demographic data: Hispanics: 48% of the population of SB county, but 59% of the total case, and a whopping 67% of all hospitalizations.  Caucasians, despite being 43% of the population, were only 17% of the total cases.  This is hard, unbiased data.  They were also much slower to get vaccinated when those became available, but luckily Delta has changed that trend and they have made improvements.  Most probably wouldn't have gotten them unless they were required too by their employers, though (Good job, employers).  This goes far beyond just being essential workers in the fields, packed together.  It was hosting maskless quincenera's when we were supposed to be stopping the spread as a community.  Other cities on the Central Coast have done a much better job than we did, even adjusting for population.

"Unfortunately, I've looked at the demographic data of Covid cases that is available through the public health department, and let's just say, one demographic has been shockingly bad.  I take care of an elderly person with other conditions due to being almost 70 and for the past year and a half I have been stuck in my apartment because they can't be responsible citizens and I am not going to risk my family members life.  Yeah we have vaccines now, I still don't want to risk a breakthrough for them.  I am leaving this city when my lease expires, as soon as possible.  It's likely we will have flu/covid this winter, and this is a terrible place to live for infectious disease.  This pandemic exposed a side of Santa Maria that just made it much worse, and statistics do not lie.  It's hard data, which my perspective is based on.  I haven't even dug into the crime demographic statistics in this city but it would not suprise me if it aligns.

This goes beyond Covid however, this is a problem with the culture of Santa Maria in general.  It shows that they don't give a damn if they go around being spreaders and filling up the local hospital in disproportionate numbers, as we saw in December 2020, which says alot about their personalities in general.

Desafortunadamente, he mirado los datos demográficos de los casos de Covid que están disponibles a través del departamento de salud pública, y digamos, un grupo demográfico ha sido sorprendentemente malo. Cuido a una persona mayor con otras afecciones debido a que tengo casi 70 años y durante el último año y medio he estado atrapado en mi apartamento porque no pueden ser ciudadanos responsables y no voy a arriesgar la vida de los miembros de mi familia. Sí, ahora tenemos vacunas, todavía no quiero arriesgarme a un gran avance por ellas. Me iré de esta ciudad cuando expire mi contrato de arrendamiento, lo antes posible. Es probable que tengamos gripe / covid este invierno, y este es un lugar terrible para vivir para enfermedades infecciosas. Esta pandemia expuso un lado de Santa María que simplemente lo empeoró mucho, y las estadísticas no mienten. Son datos duros, en los que se basa mi perspectiva. Ni siquiera he profundizado en las estadísticas demográficas de criminalidad en esta ciudad, pero no me sorprendería si se alinea.

As far as the Hispanic population I believe the percent of Santa Marians who are Latino or Hispanic is actually closer to 70%. When Covid hit the hardest Santa Barbara business were more likely to shut down since a lot depend on tourism compared to Santa Maria that ran business as usual.

"City wide fiber. I'm near Best Buy and don't have access to it. Comcast is honestly fine for me, getting around 500mb down at $80 a month, but I think the Frontier fiber is around 1GB for $50 so I would obviously upgrade if possible.

The changes they've made over just the last few years has been awesome. The whole Betteravia area is way better. Continued developments like that would be great.

More housing too. I've been looking at Zillow every couple of days and the interiors of all the houses for sale are fucking ugly. Just absolutely fucking ugly. Housing is definitely cheaper than Santa Barbara, but the difference with SB is that when you're buying the lower priced homes (relative to the area) they're still generally really nice inside with modern decor.

Santa Maria has way to many homes with ugly ass green or pink carpet with wood paneling and kitchens that haven't been updated since the 70s. It's absolutely insane.

"First, this is not a California problem-- it's a problem everywhere.  I have been looking at buying a house in about 10 different states and they are all super inflated.  

Second, there are too many buyers and not enough houses so prices are going up and they will keep going up for a long time until we start building more houses which isn't anytime soon.

Third,  when you buy a house and pay a mortgage-- the principle is essentially money you are putting in a savings account.  Taxes, insurance and interest are throw away-- but the rest is essentially an investment in your future.  So dont look at it as $1938 being thrown away...its more like $1000 being thrown away, $938 being put into your equity.

I feel bad for anyone trying to be a first time buyer.  You can do it in some other states where prices are inflated but still obtainable-- but not so much here.

The reality is you have to have dual income. And both incomes have to be pretty decent.

I am looking at main street (because I've lived right here most of my life) and see where downtown is now obsolete and the new Enos Ranch is downtown, which is basically Orcutt. I want to bring in businesses like Pipers Kombucha Bar in Orcutt. The great food trucks we have all around town. Sears has great parking, centralized location and can be open different hours than the mall bc of its exterior doors. I want to bring farmers markets here and indoor makers markets just like they do in SLO. This is not a proposed plan this is just something I've been talking about to get people interested. In Irvine (a place that TRULY has nothing to do) they have a little center where all the food truck locations have a small hole-in-the-wall restaurant to produce food and you can go get a Buhn bowl and a lobster roll all while having a fancy cocktail. Those are the types of things that would be amazing for Santa Maria. Many of us live here and work elsewhere, and I can tell you commuting is terrible.

"I think this is by far the most discussion I've seen in any r/SantaMaria post in all of the years I've been subbed!

I've lived here almost all of my life and yeah, there's a lot that really sucks about the town. If you listen to the mayor, the #1 thing that matters to the city government is retail. It's all about bringing in people and their money from all over. And that's best accomplished with big box stores along the freeway.

Santa Maria is sorely lacking a '[third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)' - a social setting other than home and work. The city has no sense of *place*. The town center mall is the only pedestrian social area worth mentioning, and it's your typical high-vacancy has-been mall that was a big deal in the 80s and is now just sort of hanging on.

There's nowhere you can go to feel like you're a *part* of something, and not just a customer passing through. Contrast this with SLO's downtown - obviously retail drives it, but you can just wander around in the crowds, visit the art museum, go to bars and see live music all over within easy walking distance, and really feel like you're immersed in the city's character.

Santa Maria completely lacks soul in comparison. I could show up to a midnight bike ride in SLO and even if I didn't already know half of the people involved I'd probably meet more interesting people, and then probably run into them downtown. In Santa Maria there's just nothing, and I never randomly run into a friend around town unless it's at the grocery store.

I say bulldoze Town Center West, all the way from Cook to Main. That sad strip mall was a disappointment from the start. Use the parking structures at the mall. Make the mall the indoor, all-weather center of things. Turn the Town Center West area into a walkable plaza with a denser concentration of restaurants and bars and specialty shops. Have interesting public art that people feel some connection to that either gets cycled through to keep it interesting or stays if it becomes a part of the city's identity. Heck, give me an art grant and I'll build something cool with a million LEDs.

As an aside, I have a shop/warehouse off West Betteravia. In my free time I sometimes build projects for Burning Man - an art car, a multi-axis gyro ride thing, whatever. If that sort of thing appeals to you and you have an idea for some creative project you want to work on but need space and/or tools, hit me up. It's not a public maker space that's open to all and sundry at any time, but I do sometimes like sharing my tools and space with interesting people.

Political action is what got us here to skyrocketing housing prices.  Material shortages caused by government lockdowns, endless money printing devaluing the dollar, and mortgage forbearance programs making a mortgage essentially free in the short term have all contributed to this.

"It's not bullshit. The dipshit owner started to have concerts without having a permit for them.

There's been zero issues with the races. The HOA hasn't even included that in their complaint. The homeowners all signed documents when buying their homes that they understand there will be 10 races at the track that produce noise. When the community gave comments about the situation, people that live in that community stated that they have no issues with the races and they understand the situation with them.

Nothing about concerts though. Which tend to go later into the night, and can feature as many as 12,000 people vs the 4,000 or so for races. For a stadium that doesn't have parking to support that many people, it spills over into the neighborhoods.

"Mariachi bands do get loud, but tend to die down by 10:30pm or so. Plus its people being joyous... work hard / play hard.  

Barking dogs that no one shuts the fuck up is mentally draining.  I dont want to harm the dog, but I really want to punch the owner who has selective hearing and simply ignores hours of incessant barking from their animal.  

Nothing in santa maria annoys me more than purest of assholes who rev their cars at all hours down the street. I hate to say it, but I usually wish to read the news the next morning and see they were in a horrific single person crash.  I really really really have an unhealthy disdain for these types of people.

"North China is a well run operation, I can't remember having anything bad there. The only time an order got screwed up, it was Doordash's fault.

New Ocean is the go to if you like potstickers. The things are huge compared to what you'd usually find elsewhere. And Chow Fun is the best. They also have a decent Pho (not Chinese), but for that I'd go to Alpho.

Ming Dynasty is another oldie but goodie. I remember the old rumors of cat being served, my response was always, ""Well it was best cat I've ever eaten.""

Magic Dragon is decent, there's certainly nothing magical about it.

As others have said, Pearl East used to be good, but the quality of the ingredients dropped off pretty quickly in the last decade or two.

Then you have the places that mainly serve bobas and food, but it's all pretty much the Burger King of Chinese food. If I want to drown my sorrows in deep fried, I'll just go to Panda.

"What happened to your friends?

Reddit is useful for a lot of things. Mostly throwing time into the trash, but I've seen people come together here. Just be careful who you decide to meet from the internet. Even in a small town like this, there are plenty of twacked-out weirdos. 

Alternatively, you might try embracing a hobby. If you pick up a mountain bike or an instrument and just do that thing in a place where other people also do that, you are bound to run into people you like. Do something you love and people you want to be around, who will appreciate the shared interest, will likely just fall into your life.

What do you do with your spare time? What are you passionate about? 

For reference, I'm now 33. It's super hard to make friends at my age. But I ride mountain bikes. Because of that I end up riding with groups and hanging out at bike shops. I actually ended up meeting my wife because of it.

"I try not to think of any Mexican restaurant or truck ""behind the scenes"" ... But, I hear you and note your observation . Even national chains like Chipotle and tacobell have had horror stories .   

Basically I fear this to be the case at all restaurants ultimately.  Operate until caught... or food tastes of disinfectant or lack of heart. super then line.  

Ultimately it's best to learn to cook great things yourself... right?  

To eat, or not to eat (at restaurants) , that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the gut to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take Arms against a Sea of  takeout troubles,
And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep;
No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-burn, and the thousand natural shocks
That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wished.
