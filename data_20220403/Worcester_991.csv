"I think Webster has more fast food per capita than Cambridge (if we don't count Chipotle, Starbucks (coffee shop mostly), Dunkin Donuts (too much in the state)). It has one McDonalds, one Subways, one Burger King, one Wendy's, one TacoBell/KFC combo, one Dominos, as well as a Papa Ginos, and Panera Bread (Cambridge also has Panera Bread but no Papa Ginos). This is all from my counting of all of the fast-food chains (there are dozens of Dunkin Donuts, 9 Starbucks in Cambridge and possibly 1 Starbucks (inside Price Chopper) and half a dozen Dunkin Donuts in Webster by the way). 

I am curious why Webster has only one major supermarket (Shaws is basically closed in Webster and Price Chopper monopolises Webster) while having a ton of fast food chains relative to its size and considering that Cambridge has 6.66 times more people (as of the 2020 Census)?

Cambridge has three Whole Foods, two Star Markets, two Trader Joes, one H-Mart, a Brothers Marketplace in Kendall Square, and a bunch of healthy organic food markets to summarise.

I am curious why Webster has so many fast food restaurants relative to its size while having few good restaurant options, while Cambridge has a ton of restaurants (even some fine dining as well) while having very few fast food chains despite it size?

"I don't want to send him to Webster, but he likes the house in Webster a lot. I don't know what I should do? I don't really like Webster myself and I have seen that it is a dying town with me seeing a plaza at 82 Worcester Rd that saw both a Shaws and a Kmart closing. I saw on Street view that as of October 2015, the Shaws has closed down and as of 1 April 2022 (I rode around Webster), it is yet to be leased to someone, which meant that the Shaws is really abandoning.

"Agreed to my first point. Worcester is definitely the first choose. It‚Äôs gotten so much better than what most people remembered it and it starting to become the next hub outside of Boston. For Vietnamese; there‚Äôs a tons of Vietnamese temples/churchs, two Vietnamese based non-profit group resources, Tons of authentic Vietnamese restaurants, the Vietnamese senior center and more.

"Holden and Shrewsbury are about tied when it comes down to the best upper class superb around Worcester. Both have great property value, school district, crime rate, etc.

Holden is generally more residential and on the quieter side. It‚Äôs off of Forest grove and Salisbury in Worcester which is known for for million dollar homes. For someone elderly it would be more ideal since it‚Äôs close enough to what a major city amenities but also enjoy the perks of being in a suburb. It‚Äôs a very nice town and it well maintained for be family friendly/one of the best places to raise a family or retire. Holden is also known as a ‚Äúsocial‚Äù suburb where people know their neighborhood and they host a like of small town events.
Shrewsbury has been thriving. Due to it being more on route to Boston but located adjacent for Worcester. You see many young professionals now and less elderly or developing family because the town has been developing non stop for the past few years. This town is very ‚Äúbusy‚Äù, one example is traffic. It‚Äôs sometime unbearable during 4-6pm on workweeks. Shrewsbury also borders Worcester ‚ÄúShrewsbury street‚Äù which is almost like the restaurant row and nightlife of Worcester which is why young professionals are flocking to that area. 

It ultimately comes down to preference. But you can‚Äôt go wrong with either Holden or Shrewsbury.

"To answer your original question and not attempt to move another citizen to Worcester, the smaller cities you listed above are all very similar.  Gardner, Leominster, and Fitchburg are all right next to one another, but they‚Äôre not right next to Worcester.  Worcester is still a 20-30 minute drive from there.  Those three smaller cities could get rather boring depending on what your uncle is used to.  They definitely aren‚Äôt ‚Äúmini Worcester‚Äôs‚Äù.  Leominster is the most built up over Gardner and Fitchburg.  Gardner and Fitchburg are both somewhat run down, lower income, maybe a bar and a mini mart on the nearest corner but not a myriad of restaurant and shopping options.  

Southbridge I‚Äôm not entirely familiar with but I am almost 100% certain it‚Äôs also a small town with minimal shops and restaurants.  

Webster I‚Äôve driven through many times on the way to Rhode Island (back roads).  It‚Äôs a decent little city with a big lake and frequent through traffic.

"I feel like Leominster is a nice middle point.

Highway to 190 into Worcester is right there. Leominster has a lot of great food options now, and the city always seems to have events. Homes for sale have been a bit scarce in the area, but it's slow season, so more should go up soon. Under $500k is realistic for a home unless he wants to buy a large home with 4+ beds. Walmart, target, market basket, Hannaford, a very sad mall that someone is trying to breathe into, and just about most stores you need are in the city or close by.

Fitchburg is right next to it, prices for homes are a bit lower, but highway access is terrible. You either need to go almost to Westminster or to the Leominster border to get on rt 2. Plus Fitchburg has Unitil for the utilities company, whereas Leominster has national grid. Unitil is the most expensive utility company in the state by FAR. Most residents who have them without solar and for natural gas have been paying over $500/month and upwards of $900/month this past winter according to Facebook griping.

"Go to a shelter. Pass the background check and adopt. Be straight with them and ask for honest straight answers about your chance of being denied. Ask what is expected of you as an owner. 

    Don't ever tell them you will let your cat out, or you had an outdoor cat. (Be honest, but not dumb honest. You don't say you smoke pot on a job application.)

Usually, shots  and spay/neuter will be included. Don't expect a kitten unless it's kitten season, and you intend to take 2.

Sterling is good & Ahimsa Haven out of Templeton/Winchendon.

Remember that adoption is a privilege that you have to qualify for.... They aren't giving away pets to have them come back in 6 months when your new girlfriend is allergic.

"Fitchburg teachers are some of the best, most educated.  Because the district is so tough, scores are so low, and therefore teachers get a LOT of professional development opportunities. 
BUT, the schools are old, many families struggle and I spent more time as a teacher triaging major traumas than actually teaching. The towns I‚Äôd avoid: Fitchburg, Southbridge, Webster.

If you want a diverse population, I‚Äôd go with Worcester in Tatnuck area. 

The best schools are Shrewsbury, Westboro, and Northboro/Southboro.  But they are almost the most expensive towns. 

If you want a more conservative ‚Äúred‚Äù town, I‚Äôd go to Millbury. The schools aren‚Äôt great and it‚Äôs a very ‚Äútownie‚Äù town.  It‚Äôs definitely Trump territory. Auburn is similar but more commercial build up. 

I absolutely love Holden - having lived here, Northboro, Brookline, Grafton and Westfield.

"Some thoughts on schools

By some measures, Shrewsbury is ranked as one of the best districts in MA. https://backgroundchecks.org/top-school-districts-in-massachusetts.html

Another great school system is Wachusett, which is a regional district of Holden, Rutland, Sterling, Paxton, and Princeton. Not sure why Sterling and Princeton aren't on your list; quiet towns with better schools and less crime than Fitchburg & Leominster with likely a shorter commute to Worcester.

Lancaster is another town with pretty good schools and good access to I190 into Worcester (Nashoba regional schools).

Westborough has excellent schools.

Hudson is pretty nice; it used to be a bit rough, but 10+ or so years ago they built new elementary and high schools which has brought in a really big wave of gentrification. 

It looks like all of those high schools have lacrosse.

Random thought for commuting: if you have to take I290 through Worcester center, use google maps to estimate commute times (it has an option for that). I290 can be tough.

I'm not that familiar with south of Worcester besides Sutton (several friends live there). Very nice town, decent schools, fairly easy commute into Worcester up 146.

Unrelated, I had a house for a little while in Brimfield. It is a very nice town with OK (not great) schools, but even though US20 has been upgraded a bit, I don't think I'd want to commute to Worcester. Sturbridge is probably as far west as I would want (though I have a low tolerance for commutes). And 3 weeks a year US20 in Brimfield will be crazy with traffic (Brimfield antiques fair).",t2_3yegdcm9,dew2459,0,1648756235.0,0,t1_i2w1u4l,i2w1u4l,True,rainbowprinttiger,t3_tt51sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tt51sx/worcester_area_towns/,Worcester area towns,/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tt51sx/worcester_area_towns/i2w1u4l/,6,r/WorcesterMA,0,6

"I personally prefer north of Worcester but that's based on where I grew up and am familiar with. There's nothing wrong with the other areas. I know Westborough and Shrewsbury are known for having great school systems but they're also pricy. Just FYI, how far your money will go with that list is going to vary a lot, from $$ for, generally, areas west and south of the city to $$$$$$ for generally east of the city. North is in between somewhere with the exception of Leominster and Fitchburg which are probably close to Worcester price wise. There's also a huge difference in lifestyle between somewhere like Worcester and Oakham so that's a factor too.

"I've been looking into doing this once the weather has gotten nicer. And I would definitely be interested in volunteering some time and help invest in some of the supplies.

Here are some things to consider for picking trash 

* Materials (Amazon and Harbor freight will probably be the best price wise for most of these)
   * Trash Bags: Obviously - The city may provide trash bags for picking up trash, but i'd suggest also getting some smaller ones to put inside so that they don't rip.
   * Five Gallon Buckets: you'll want to use five gallon buckets to put things into rather than directly into the trash bags. This way the bags won't rip as easily and people don't lug as much around. Market basket/pricerite/home depot all have them for $5ish
      * And also not sure if this is an issue but something to put needles or other sharps in.
   * Grabbers: You'll probably want some [arm extension grabbers](https://www.amazon.com/Reacher-Foldable-Lightweight-Reaching-Extension/dp/B078RMCFWQ/ref=sr_1_8?keywords=trash+picker+grabber&qid=1648743196&sprefix=trash+pick%2Caps%2C116&sr=8-8) \- these are fairly heavy duty and will last a lot longer. Otherwise they do sell them at the dollar store but they'll fall apart on you eventually and can't pick up as heavy items (at $1.25 now).
   * Gloves: Don't want to touch some things
   * A shovel of some sort.
   * You'll want a hiviz shirt or [vest](https://www.amazon.com/PeerBasics-Reflective-Visibility-Volunteer-Construction/dp/B0761YKMTV/ref=sr_1_11?crid=28YBF0FLX1O7W&keywords=high%2Bvisibility%2Bvest&qid=1648743791&sprefix=high%2Bvisibility%2Bvest%2Caps%2C94&sr=8-11&th=1)
   * Some sort of sanitizing station for hands/grabbers/etc.
* Find a local business that you can partner with where people can park if they can't walk nearby. Especially offices where their parking lots aren't used on the weekends.
* Get some sort of flag or post to show the team what area is being focused on. A start to finish sort of thing or give people teams and quadrants.",t2_5jtainjk,thedecentshepherd,0,1648744337.0,0,t1_i2v6s89,i2v6s89,True,dpceee,t3_tsnlwb,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tsnlwb/i_am_looking_to_organize_a_cleanup_of_millbrook/,I am looking to organize a cleanup of Millbrook Street in May,/r/WorcesterMA/comments/tsnlwb/i_am_looking_to_organize_a_cleanup_of_millbrook/i2v6s89/,1,r/WorcesterMA,0,1

"That's totally understandable, I wouldn't call Worcester a great city in terms of a ""vacation"" but I would suggest Grafton, as the town itself is quite beautiful and there are quite a lot of outdoor things to do. Boston isn't super accessible from the area, even by the commuter rail which tends to only run hourly. It may be cheaper to put guests up in hotels in Boston or renting a larger place in the Boston area than owning a house that will mainly stay empty most of the time.

Do remember to look at the tax rates in the different towns and their utilities. For instance Shrewsbury has town owned tel/internet and electric utilities, and Holden has town owned/run electric utilities. These tend to be less expensive than National Grid and in some cases more reliable. I'd also look into maybe buying a duplex, where you can rent out one side and then use the other for your intended usage. 

Another consideration is that a lot of Turn-Key properties in the area are going to be more expensive and anything else will likely need a decent amount of renovations.

I'd also like to note that the tone of your main message comes across as a tad elitist and a little out of touch with the area. It comes across as if you're saying ""I live in Cambridge and I love the amenities in Cambridge and Cambridge is more elite than Worcester in every way, and because of this I don't consider Worcester as good enough place to live in or for my future business BUT I want you, the people of Worcester to help me find another residence, that I'll sometimes use."" I think that less detail would have gotten your more results.

I respect the rationality behind your analysis, but I think that your tone is off-putting. Such as blaming the towns for their lack of 5g in some of the other mentions or when often it isn't under the towns control but Verizon or AT&T's corporate decision making or shaming someone for using an older phone.

"Worcester has a size-able Vietnamese population and is quite culturally diverse! There's a grocery store called Asian Supermarket that if I recall is mostly Vietnamese but has a wide variety of culturally Asian foods.

As someone who has spent a lot of time in both Worcester and Cambridge, I would say there are plenty of similarities. Though any of the suburbs of Worcester and Worcester itself is not easily accessible by public transit.

The housing stock in the area has also become quite competitive and more expensive, which always concerns me when a house isn't being planned on being used as a primary residence. Especially in a working class city like Worcester, this idea sounds a tad elitist.

"so you think your ability to own guns is more important than all the other things you support? not saying that your 2nd amendment rights don't matter but i really think that you're overstating the actual value of owning a gun. the real problem is with people like you who let the republicans hijack that issue at the expense of other things that matter to you. by valuing gun rights over other things, you're actually making it very easy for people to manipulate you into supporting causes that fight against things like LGBT rights, vaccination, sex education in schools, minimum wage, healthcare, etc. 

It's incorrect of people who actually hold a position like yours to say that you're ""a little right"" when you just mean that you support gun rights. democrats do not want to abolish the 2nd amendment and there is no real chance of that happening. republicans, however, do want to criminalize gay marriage and vaccine research. there's a big difference in their explicit platforms and just saying ""gee whizz I'd better vote for a Republican since this state is so overwhelmingly blue"" is ridiculous, but that's what your position must boil down to.

"Rates are rising at the same time as home prices, so that will squeeze you on your monthly payment, as well as potentially on your down payment. What happens now is the market will begin reacting to higher rates into this new warmer weather market and summer. You may see prices level off as a result or people drop out of the home search altogether.  It becomes a tug of war between interest rates and home prices. Buyers can only take so much fluctuation before their math gets thrown off and they can no longer afford a home. Sellers and realtors will push prices higher until it breaks the math for buyers. That said, there is still a very low supply and, until further notice, a glut of buyers, so this will continue until a change is forced by one of the inputs. Many will race to lock in rates and prices now,  making it likely that we see a ""race to the bottom"" type of situation, but things have gone up for years now and it's always tough to read.

Look at the gateway programs. There are income restrictions but if you don‚Äôt have a high down payment they will pay 3% up to $15k of your down payment so you only have to cover closing costs. This is like a ‚Äúsecond mortgage‚Äù. We have enough saved for a small DP and closing but we don‚Äôt want to burn all of our saved money so we are utilizing that program so we can save our other $10k for fixes on a house we find. We opted to only have one of us get the loan as both of our incomes would push us over that income limit.

"My partner and I are currently in the market to buy. Born and raised in Worcester. Staying in Worcester, no exceptions for us.

Rent prices are crazy too. Everything is mostly over $1500 for rent and in some shitty areas. We went to one open house on a Saturday 11-1 and the offer deadline was 4pm that same day. We have dogs and motorcycles so we need a garage so that already confined our list but if you don‚Äôt need a huge yard or a garage space, it shouldn‚Äôt be as bad. For example, back in January we offered $300k on a $285k and our offer as accepted.

We were lucky enough to be able to back out and get out deposit back. This is why we upped our price to $350k. Can we afford even more? Yes.

"Its not ""your"" window, it's called the overton window. Its a window or range of policies that are acceptable at any given time. I dont care about the vaccination policy. Think big. Capitalism, the role of the state, if there should be a state, the limit of what is private property and if/when should it be taken away, collectivism vs individualism, what sort of collectives should we have, ect. 

As an example, free or ""universal"" Healthcare in the US is kind of on the line for being in or out of the overton window. While in Europe, it's within the window. Now the window of what is ""socially acceptable"" can change, like the LGBT movement. Now with centrists, when the window changes, they change with it. My dad 15 years ago was very anti LGBT, and now he is open to legalized homosexual marriages while also being a Trump support. 

Look at the Republican party on this issue, the mainstream narrative with them is that they seem to be more pro LGBT than they were 15 years ago. So as a result, since both parties (which are our only choices) are pro LGBT, that will change our society. And to go against the issue will make you a social outcast, or someone ""outside of the window"". 

I'm sure you understood all this to begin with, and I am not criticizing you.

 >Patriot Front is an American nationalist, white supremacist, and neo-fascist hate group. Part of the broader alt-right movement, the group split off from the neo-Nazi organization Vanguard America during the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally in 2017. The group maintains an Americana aesthetic, utilizing imagery of American culture, patriotism, and other widely accepted traditional American values to promote its ideology.

"1800 sqft house inside Worcester city limits, built in 1956 with recent window and insulation improvements. Typically <$200 electric per month. That's with no AC and oil heat.

My advice: contact [MassSave](https://www.masssave.com/en/learn/residential/?gclid=CjwKCAjwuYWSBhByEiwAKd_n_v6gcjvJmf7kpXvCacz8QgJIe8o8-4Wkb2HSl0Z_aVS9uSCCprKZ3BoCn5UQAvD_BwE) to set up a free energy audit for the home. They have a lot of rebates and no- or low-interest programs for HVAC and insulation upgrades.

I used to go to Building 19 when they were still in business. I seldom bought anything but I enjoyed browsing what was sometimes quirky stuff. They once had a ton of Civil Defense stuff and was letting it go cheap. I did buy a blanket that was 100% wool and would fit a King size bed. I kept it in my car and it got used a lot for camping, the beach and football games. I don't know what happened to it, might still have it packed away somewhere.

"Canal District has been closed since the pandemic went into full swing, I doubt it will be back.

The Beaver Brook one is Mondays and Friday in the Beaver Brook parking lot on Chandler. They have bread, meat and veggies. It's not too bad, but seems to be the best one we can find in the city.

Grafton Farmers Market is on Wednesday, used to be in the common but I think they'll be moving it - so check in on that. They have veggies, meat, and niceties like snack vendors and people who sell various wares.

Shrewsbury Farmers Market is also Wednesday at the town hall. I find this one to be a bit lax on actual food but they do have a meat/eggs person, a couple produce farms and they usually have Mrs. Moriconi's Ice Cream cart there.

These are the ones I frequent, but there are quite a few in the surrounding towns, here is the site to find them:
