"I bought 1.5 years ago so not relevant, but got under asking price, however the place needed work and sat on the market for over a year. House inspection turned up many issues, critical ones were more or less addressed by the motivated seller upon request, but overall the house was not well cared for and still needed significant improvements.

Close to your work, good schools, shopping/restaurants nearby, walkability, house size, garage, lot size, neighbors, traffic).

"My parents both worked for Prisma up until a few years ago (one was a nursing supervisor and the other a graveyard shift ER doctor/General Practitioner or something along those lines). If you don't mind a drive that is just over 30 minutes with traffic, Chapin/Ballentine area is super nice. The whole area was pretty small but recently new establishments have been popping up everywhere. Other pros would probably be things like the schools being really good (for SC standards anyway), lots of lake access and recreation, and people tend to be really friendly! It's definitely suburban so anywhere you go will probably need to be in a car, but it's more of a spread and clustered suburbia than a sprawling contiguous one (if that makes sense). Property isn't too bad, but it depends on what you're looking for. For something new and relatively generic you'd probably be looking 250-400k range depending on location. If you want something more scenic you can get something big and lakefront for around 1m.

Lexington is nice also, but I personally can't stand the traffic in and around Lexington. Sunset Blvd is the worst road of all and if you're on it around 5pm you'll get to see why they call it sunset (it's because you're stuck in traffic until the sun goes down).

"By far the best real estate bargains (if that term can be applied any longer) are in the St. Andrews area, especially Whitehall.  I mean the real Whitehall, not the other subdivisions that tried to leverage their proximity.  The school district is great (Lexington/Richland District 5), although the high school (Irmo) has deteriorated over time.  For the most part, Whitehall consists of homes that were built in the 1970s, and probably average about 2400 square feet.  Almost all have been modernized.

"Lexington has much lower taxes than Columbia proper.  But I believe Cayce / West Columbia are pretty low as well.  It depends on your lifestyle.  If you want to be close to all the microbreweries and stuff, there are lots more downtown than out toward Lexington.  Personally I don't like Lexington, most of it the commercial districts are just strip malls or the modern equivalents.  Traffic is terrible.  One thing that Columbia has done well lately is to develop riverwalks near downtown.  Lots of really nice paved but scenic areas to walk along the river.  Where I live downtown, I can walk to some decent restaurants through treelined neighborhoods.

"Such a clever response.  

Tell me... are you a Trump supporter? You remember him,  right? 

He's the one who calls Vladimir Putrid a genius.  He brought Russia's top spy into the Oval Office.  He incited an insurrection against the United States government, mismanaged a pandemic that killed hundreds of thousands of Americans by claiming it would just ""go away,"" separated children from their families at the border, lost those children in the bureaucracy, tear-gassed peaceful protesters on Lafayette Square so he could hold a photo op holding a Bible in front of a church, tried to block all Muslims from entering our country, got impeached, got impeached again, had the worst jobs record of any president in modern history, pressured Ukraine to dig dirt on Joe Biden, fired the FBI director for investigating his ties to Russia, bragged about firing the FBI director on TV...

"The Cayce/West Columbia area is fantastic. You’re 5 minutes from downtown Columbia even with “traffic” (we don’t have to much of that downtown), but you’re in Lexington County. The Lexington County taxes are SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper than Richland County taxes. A slightly more rural area still close to downtown would be Springdale, possibly even Red Bank if you want more rural but it’s a little further and not easily accessible via busses. Not sure where you’re from and what the cost of living is there, but rent downtown is more expensive relative to South Carolina because the rentals cater to college students whose parents generally pay. But in the Cayce/west Columbia area you can find cheaper rents.

"Ratio (peruvian fusion)

Kao (Thai)

COA (upscale mexican, really good imo)

Hendrix (rooftop bar, never been downstairs)

The Whig (great bar food)

Saluda's (pricey for sure but honestly one of my top recommendations)

Lula Drake (wine bar. Amazing chicken. nice atmosphere)

Kiki's chicken and waffles (the red velvet chicken and waffles are amazing)

The War Mouth (southern cooking. pretty gas as they say)

Hall's (chophouse. pricey. another top recommendation. Lunch is great and cheaper than dinner)

Arabesque (Lebanese. Good on the tastebuds)

Whiskey Kitchen (little bit away from DT but worth it if you're looking for classy southern food lol)

Black rooster (French-ish? I like it)

Granby Grill (my preference over The Whig but I'm biased. I went every week when they opened up. Had their whole menu)

Edit: if you're looking for Mexican that isn't upscale. I can give a list of about 10 good taco spots lol but you're gonna have to be willing to drive. Downtown cola doesn't really have anything.

**Man gets life for killing woman who mistook his car for Uber**  


&#x200B;

  
COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A South Carolina man was sentenced to life in prison Tuesday for the 2019 abduction and murder of a 21-year-old college student who mistook his car for her Uber ride.  


  
The jury took a little more than an hour to find Nathaniel Rowland guilty of killing Samantha Josephson, a University of South Carolina student who disappeared from Columbia’s Five Points entertainment district in March 2019.  


  
“Her dreams were my dreams, and her death was my death. I close my eyes, and I feel what she endured at his hands,” the victim’s mother, Marci Josephson, said during the sentencing phase of Rowland’s trial Tuesday.  


  
The student from Robbinsville, New Jersey, got into Rowland’s car thinking it was an Uber ride that would take her back to her apartment, prosecutors said. Instead, she found herself trapped because Rowland had the childproof locks on, investigators said. She was never seen alive again.  


  
Covered in roughly 120 stab wounds, her body was later found in remote woods about 65 miles (105 kilometers) from Columbia. The death cast a national spotlight on ride-hailing safety and led to some changes, including more prominent displays of driver’s license plates.  


  
Rowland maintained his innocence before being sentenced, but Circuit Judge Clifton Newman noted that all the evidence pointed to Rowland.  


  
“She obviously put up an amazing fight against you and left a sufficient trail for the jury to see what you did,” Newman said after sentencing Rowland to life in prison. A person convicted of murder is not eligible for parole in South Carolina.  


  
Wearing a mask, Rowland showed little emotion as Josephson’s relatives reflected on the pain of their loss and how Josephson’s future – the college senior was slated to attend law school on a full scholarship – was cut short.  


  
The prosecution spent about a week presenting voluminous evidence and called nearly three dozen witnesses. Experts linked Josephson’s blood to the interior of Rowland’s Chevrolet Impala and to the suspected murder weapon, a knife with two blades. Her blood was also found on cleaning supplies in the trash behind the home of the man’s girlfriend at the time — and on a sock and bandana owned by Rowland, the experts testified.  


  
Other evidence included cellphone tracking data pinpointing Rowland’s location the night of the crime. One forensic scientist testified that DNA collected from Rowland’s fingernails matched the victim’s genetic material, and DNA belonging to both suspect and victim were found on gloves also located in the trash.  


  
Rowland’s defense attorneys pointed out that scientists weren’t absolutely certain Rowland’s DNA was on the knife. His attorneys also argued that although Josephson appeared to fight her attacker, none of Rowland’s DNA was found on her body and he had no visible marks of such a fight after his arrest. The defense called no witnesses, and Rowland did not testify.  


  
Before resting the defense’s case, Rowland’s lawyer asked the charges be thrown out because prosecutors had a circumstantial case — never showing that Rowland actually killed Josephson nor that he was driving the vehicle when she disappeared.  


  
Newman rejected the request, saying there was an avalanche of direct and circumstantial evidence that a jury should consider.",t2_ag2bf3jz,HipHop_Local_Legends,0,1647013879.0,0,t1_i093r1m,i093r1m,True,HipHop_Local_Legends,t3_tbsuqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiasc/comments/tbsuqe/on_march_29th_2019_21_year_old_samantha_josephson/,"On March 29th 2019, 21 year old Samantha Josephson was stabbed 120 times after mistakenly getting into a car she thought was her Uber.

"I am not in an interracial relationship so I don’t want to speak for any POCs experience because I could be wrong. But I am in a same-sex marriage, have a 7 year old, and am pregnant with my second. We live in Irmo and my daughter is enrolled in schools within the Lexington-Richland 5 district. 

I grew up in Lexington and have lived in winnsboro. I know that Lexington is often praised for being a great suburb to live in but growing up it was a lot rich racists and closed-minded republicans. It was not the area I wanted to raise my children, especially because the infrastructure is poor and there is overcrowding. My wife and I dread having to go to Lexington. 

The Chapin area is nice but it’s somewhat like a smaller Lexington area which basically means very white washed. 

I think the Irmo/HE Corley/Dutch Fork areas within the district are more diverse and the schools are good I am happy with them. 

Living in Irmo I am close to the interstate, within 15 minutes from downtown Columbia. 15-35 minutes from Lexington depending on where and how bad traffic is. Property taxes in Richland county are cheaper than Lexington. 

Saluda shoals park, riverbanks zoo, and Irmo community park are places we frequent regularly and enjoy. Harbison Blvd has a lot of restaurants/fast food/small scale shopping although the traffic is a mess sometimes. 

< 2 hours from Charleston and Greenville. We do day trips to the beach a lot during the summer.

"Chapin has equally annoying traffic to Lexington, but much less stuff. Both have underdeveloped infrastructure and layouts for the amount of people moving there. I live in between the two in Irmo near the lake and it’s not bad. It is true that it takes 25 minutes to drive across Lexington most times of day.

If you ever do end up working in Downtown Columbia (or anywhere past the I-26/I-20 interchange), please be aware that they are about to blow up “malfunction junction” in what will be a 10 year project. Some estimates are saying that the current 45 minute commute to DT from Lexington will become close to 90 minutes.

"Lexington is a traffic nightmare! Everything is at least 30 minutes away due to bottleneck traffic. It seems like traffic only dies down after 8 pm. Schools are good (as good as it gets for South), grocery store shelves are always almost empty or mostly empty if you're shopping on Saturday or Sunday. Lexington Walmart is a embarrassing disaster but thankfully there are other stores in the area. Home prices have gone thru the roof and locals are pissed off because out of towners are ""raising"" prices. Most new homes don't have much property and houses are stacked almost next to each other 8-10 ft is probably most distance you'll get. HOA is everywhere and they don't do anything but collect money. Our across the pond ""neighbors"" are in Lexington but outta Lexington city limits (don't ask me to explain) and they enjoy shooting their guns early in the morning.

"My wife is a bit of a coffee snob so she prefers Drip and Cool Beans, which are both downtown, but we're in the NE as well and The Human Bean will do in a pinch. I think it's a chain.


Papa Jazz is our longstanding record shop and it's amazing. We have some bands come through and play at New Brookland Tavern or the Art Bar and some other spots.  The pandemic definitely slowed down the live music scene, but if you keep your eyes out for it you'll find some good stuff.  I've lived here for quite a while and have caught bands I would never expect to come through (Beach House and Deerhoof for example).


Hunter Gatherer is one of our favorite restaurant/breweries, and the Gourmet Shop and DiPrados are good lunch spots.  Most of the action is downtown, in Five Points, or The Vista, but it's not a bad haul from the NE. I would recommend planning day trips to hit multiple places.  It would be fun to hit the Soda City Market on Saturday and then walk the State House grounds as well as  the Horseshoe at USC. All easily walkable. 


The NE is more geared toward families but you'll have fun with your dog in the outdoors for sure.  We have The Village at Sandhill up here, which is an outdoor shopping center that started out very promising but sadly is more of a ghost town now. There are still some decent spots there so I would recommend checking it out to see what's there.  It's mostly chains but not a bad option for nearby burgers or burritos, and there's a movie theater and a bookstore. 


I'm not a motorcyclist, but imagine it would be good here. I would recommend taking the back roads up to Ridgeway. They have a quaint downtown with a decent restaurant (Olde Town Hall).  It's like going back in time.


You'll probably find all the places you like and make them your regular spots.  My twin has lived in and around Charlotte for as long as I've been here so I'm aware of the differences but have to say I really prefer it here.

">There’s a belief that the palmetto cheese cheeseburger originated here at a rosewood Dairy Bar (now run by Zesto’s).

That is interesting… i have never heard the dairy bar put forth as the pimento burger progenitor… fwiw my grandmother who lived a block away when the RDB opened and walked there once or twice a week to eat claims Mathis’ out on St. Andrews was the pimento burger OG… 

rockaways is good but about ten or so years ago i saw someone almost choke to death there then throw up his food onto the table, so ive never neen back since lmao… obviously not the resturants fault or anything ive just had a mental block…

___

editing for some rockaways legends and rumors.. 

an old buddy of mine (who was much more of a barfly than myself, since past god rest him) told me rockaways is called the “athletic club” so guys who’s wives wondered where their other halves were spending all their time could show the credit card statement, and would be able to say “babe ive been at the gym every night! look, it says athletic club right there!”, when they were really at rockaways drinking… 

also, make of it what you will, but apparently, according to the same buddy, rockaways has had a fire or two for which claims may or may not have been taken out, which all the various tchotchkes miraculously survived. *i* am of course not, and i emphasize **not**, insinuating anything, but *some* have pointed out how fortuitous it was for all the tchotchkes to have made it through the blaze… 

anyways, 

just some quirky history/legends/rumors about the place, definitely a columbia staple for classic american bar food and good ambiance

edit 2..

the pimento burger seems to have originated at *a* dairy bar, one on south main that has since closed… i can not find anything regarding if the *rosewood* dairy bar is related to that dairy bar in any way, which would make it a direct continuation of that chain of custody for ownership of the “original pimento burger” claim… so i guess that answers the “who did it first” question, but the jury is out ig on who (that is still doing it) has been doing it the longest… however, the most important thing is to get one somewhere… plenty of options and ive never *ever* had a bad one lol.. sorry for the long winded comments",t2_4k8prmra,CookingWithTheBlues,0,1646216792.0,0,t1_hz17ruu,hz17ruu,False,majorjayzer,t3_t4fkz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiasc/comments/t4fkz7/restaurant_reco/,restaurant reco,/r/columbiasc/comments/t4fkz7/restaurant_reco/hz17ruu/,3,r/columbiasc,0,3

"get some hash and rice somewhere. Maurice’s is my favorite personally. theres a few locations around town. if you want something(edit-something bbq/hash related) a little more upscale, go with midwood. its less “local” though. Rush’s is a good local fast food chain.

edit- why tf is this getting downvoted? Maurice’s and Rush’s are as Columbia as it gets, and hash and rice is about as close to a uniquely Carolina type dish as you can get, along with like shrimp and grits maybe but that isnt much of a deep cut.. everyones going to know about shrimp and grits and can easily make it at home. if someone has a better uniquely Carolina, or better yet uniquely Columbia dish id like to hear it. Frogmore stew maybe? Chicken bog? But again like shrimp and grits those are more low country things, and not stuff you can usually find in restaurants. the honest truth is we are not very culinarily interesting. my only other suggestion is the pimento burger at Mathias’ sandwich shop. after that ive got nothing.",t2_4k8prmra,CookingWithTheBlues,1,1646161827.0,0,t1_hyy473j,hyy473j,True,majorjayzer,t3_t4fkz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiasc/comments/t4fkz7/restaurant_reco/,restaurant reco,/r/columbiasc/comments/t4fkz7/restaurant_reco/hyy473j/,3,r/columbiasc,0,3

I have lived in the Lake Carolina since 08...just before the real estate bubble burst hard.  The rental agencies came in and bought out many of the houses in the area.  Most houses are rentals and the area has gone down hill since.  Hardscrabble and Clemson/Killian Rd are looking more and more like Two Notch.  The roads are horrible and there is trash everywhere. Most of my neighbors haved moved away recently. I don't know anyone on my street anymore.

"I lived in an apartment on Polo Rd near Sesqui about 6 years ago when it was much more affordable and I felt safe walking around there alone as a young woman. Despite it now being a lot more expensive on that side of town I really think it's become more dangerous even in pricier neighborhoods. I lived in Lake Carolina very close to Sandhills from 2019-2020 and even though it's nice and they even have a private security guard, I wouldn't call it safe. I would get sexually harassed sometimes walking my dog (on ""nice"" streets where the houses are like 300k), one time it was so bad I had to run to a neighbor's house for safety after a man exposed himself and tried to get me in his car at like 10am on a Tuesday. Around that time there was also an occurrence where two men in a van tried to abduct a teenage girl from her backyard around the same area and luckily failed. We also had people snooping around our cars and trying to open the doors on multiple occasions in our driveway at night.

"As many have said, you can practically stay anywhere. Most one bedrooms, downtown, can be had for 900-1400 or so. Really depends on your style, but Tapps has nice offerings and is at the center of everything imo. Sola Station is also pretty nice and has easy access to I26 and I20 (debatable during rush hour -> malfunction junction lol?) via I-126. If you want something a little more quiet I know a lot of people recommend the Shandon and Rosewood area, which would probably be cheaper too. My last recommendation would be out towards the forest drive area. Kind of has its own bustling energy. Don't have specific complexes in that area though.   


Depending on your travel needs and distance from downtown, maybe you would prefer something out the way in which case there are a ton of options in Lexington and Irmo that would probably be cheaper/larger than most things you will find downtown.

Specific? lol you must be new here. Once a week my roommate or our duplex housemates would be fighting with Peggy over some dumb sh*t. The only time I defeated them was by reaching out to the codes dept. Peggy had her worker putting these posts in the ground to stop us from driving over the curb to park. I emailed the codes as a concerned citizen who noticed a fence being built blocking a sidewalk. About a week later the workers were pulling the posts out.,t2_797lt,LosCoons,0,1643809542.0,0,t1_hv9wava,hv9wava,False,Z3R0faith,t3_shlq03,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiasc/comments/shlq03/positive_negative_experiences_with_property/,Positive / negative experiences with property management around Columbia?,/r/columbiasc/comments/shlq03/positive_negative_experiences_with_property/hv9wava/,2,r/columbiasc,0,2

"Great Jones is literally the worst. We rented from a different company that we did lots of research on and within two months, they gave our lease to Great Jones. Great Jones refused to fix any of our issues even though it was in our lease that they were responsible (the lease was still from the other rental company since that's what we had signed for a year - they were supposed to follow it, though). Our home was infested with ants and a family of possums made a home in our vents. They said they would not do anything about either. When the time came around to rent again, the lease they sent us was no surprise. They would cover nothing. If any issues arose, we were responsible. Needless to say, we left. They sent us a bill (on top of not giving us our security deposit back) of $3,000 for them to repaint the house. We literally didn't do anything to the walls while living there and deep cleaned for three days before leaving, so this charge didn't make any sense. We didn't have pictures to show that the paint job was just bad when we moved in, so there was no way for us to fight the charge.",t2_7v5ds2nn,Smol_borborb,0,1643775764.0,0,t1_hv8g14n,hv8g14n,True,Z3R0faith,t3_shlq03,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiasc/comments/shlq03/positive_negative_experiences_with_property/,Positive / negative experiences with property management around Columbia?,/r/columbiasc/comments/shlq03/positive_negative_experiences_with_property/hv8g14n/,2,r/columbiasc,0,2

"Customer service sucks and home delivery is worse. After several months of spotty delivery, and then a month where I never got the paper more than 3 days of the 6 days a week, I called to cancel. Who wants to spend their life (a) not getting a paper they paid for, and (b) having to report the missed delivery every day in order to even get credit for their failure to deliver (when I am certain they already know it was not delivered!) 

Customer service rep tried everything to get me not to cancel, including offering 4 weeks free. (Who wants 4 free weeks of a paper that is not even delivered 50% of the time !?!?! WTF??? ). Finally the customer service rep as a last ditch admitted they did not even have a permanent carrier on the route, and “we’re having a meeting today to resolve”?!?!? Needless to say I cancelled, then of course since I had a built up credit for two months for all the failures to deliver, they refused to refund my money. From then on they just did not deliver at all. I consider the fact that they would not refund the remaining balance, and failed to deliver, as straight out theft. My advice is to stay as far away from The State as you possibly can. (The physical newspaper is so small anyway, it’s not even good as a fish wrap anymore!)

My advice - subscribe to a real newspaper and read it online(The Wash Post is good), and read COLADAILY and FreeTimes for local news.

"My experience probably isn’t typical for most here, but I have a charging station at work, so I charge there like 95% of the time. There are quite a few chargers in downtown, though most if not all are in public garages that you need to pay for. There is an overall lack of chargers I would say, I don’t really ever find myself charging when out and about.

Also, Tesla is not allowed to sell cars in SC, so you’ll have to go to Charlotte. They also can’t operate service centers in SC, so you’ll have to go to Charlotte. They do have mobile service available, but sometimes they can’t help, so you’ll have to go to Charlotte.

"Aiken SP.  Highly recommended. Tent sites are across the road by the pond.  Facilities are bad over there but everything else is good.  Or camp along side the RVs.

Jones Gap is awesome.  Walk in tent spots some are very close in.  Jones Gap trail is good and easy.  Rim of the Gap trail is best short hike in SC.  We did it down hill from Caesars Head SP back into Jones Gap.  They close that trail in the winter.

"I've stayed at several State Park cabins, Dreher, Poinsett, Devil's Fork, and Table Rock.  I've tent camped at Table Rock, Lee, Harbison, and Aiken.  Poinsett is pretty unique, it's topology is like the foothills meet the coast.  Lots of hills that'll remind you of the mountains, and then you'll stumble of marshy areas with palmettos etc.  Table Rock is a fun challenging hike.  Aiken I think would have been great because they have a canoe trail that I wanted to try, but it was flooded when we went.  devil's fork is gorgeous.  Mountain lake is really cool.  In general though, when you tent camp at most state parks, your only choice is to camp in amongst the RVs.  There are some rustic camps (Table Rock has a Hike In rustic camp).",t2_4sigt,HUP,0,1642098384.0,0,t1_hsioa7m,hsioa7m,True,ginab0bina,t3_s35afy,https://www.reddit.com/r/columbiasc/comments/s35afy/i_want_to_hear_about_your_favorite_sc_camping/,I want to hear about your favorite SC camping spots!,/r/columbiasc/comments/s35afy/i_want_to_hear_about_your_favorite_sc_camping/hsioa7m/,4,r/columbiasc,0,4

Thank you. I woke up feeling pretty down but better now.  I have 3 other siblings that call and visit. I call or he calls me a couple of times a day. I can get there sometimes a couple of days each week or at least every other. I will be there when he takes his final turn. My mother who has been divorced from him since 1976 has been with him a lot to help out.

"I dealt with a similar situation a while back. I’d say this: do an internal gut check, and think about what you’ll be able to live with after he’s gone. I wanted to have no regrets, and I don’t have any (although I wasn’t there constantly, I did see him most weekends and the last few days at the end). 

That answer will be different for different people, but honestly this isn’t just about him. It’s also about you and the fact that you alone will have to live with your decisions.
