"I'm amazed more people don't die on that road daily - with people tailgating even if you go 55 on a non divided highway with all the driveways and accesses constantly having traffic go to a stop in the right lane.  I've seen huge box trucks swerve to avoid collisions since they were following too closely to someone turning.  

Not to mention the middle lane chicken game.

Crossing has been an issue forever - between drunks going from Kelly's to Slammin Sammy's to exchange students who think they can bike it, it's a terribly designed road that needs double the crossings and a median strip.

At least during the winter I can take the beach road and keep my sanity - that's about to end though as the out of state plates are here.

My wife is also a 10+ year critical care nurse and had a hard time finding a suitable position at the hospital (and elsewhere) when I initially accepted an engineering position with one of the local towns. All she could find were PRN positions which wasn’t going to work for us with unknown hours and the cost of housing. She also applied for less “critical” positions/departments but to no avail.  I ended up not taking the position after about 2-3 months (my agreed upon start date was after wrapping up current projects) because she couldn’t find a suitable nursing position and wasn’t willing to travel to Chesapeake. This was in 2019 and maybe things have changed since then. It’s definitely not impossible but just letting you know our experience. I hope it works for you because it is such a wonderful place!

"The people of the Outer Banks are, indeed, wonderful, welcoming, and super friendly.

There is only one hospital on the Outer Banks, and my understanding is that their ICU is relatively small. I know a lot of patients get transferred to Chesapeake General Hospital, which is about 70 miles from Kill Devil Hills.

My further understanding is that all localities are desperate for medical personnel, so I doubt you will have any trouble finding a job.

What you may find difficult is your ability to afford a house. If you haven't done so already, you may want to take a look at Realtor or Zillow. Prices are obscene. Long-term rentals are nonexistent.

As a resident of Chesapeake, you may want to look into a job here. You will still live very close to the Outer Banks, but housing prices, while still expensive, are much more sane. We make frequent day trips to the OBX. I drove down there just last Friday to adopt a couple of kitties. 

I'm not allowed to post the link here, but I have written two travel guides about the Outer Banks. They are very comprehensive and will provide you with loads of information about the area. It's called The Beach Lover's Guide to the Outer Banks and is available on Amazon. There are two volumes, one for the Kitty Hawk to Nags Head area and one for the area south of Oregon Inlet.

"Don't cancel your trip. 

Nourishment inconveniences a very small amount of people when it is happening.  Keep in mind its just that, an inconvenience.

I was living in a oceanfront home when they did the first round in Nags Head. The amount of time that the beach directly in front of the home was closed off lasted for less than 36 hours.  In that time, the beach is still open and you can walk to the areas directly north and south of the work zone.

Immediately following the sand pumping, the new sand does have a little smell as all the organic stuff dries out. That lasts for a couple of days and is not really a big deal.

"The first year they did beach nourishment in Nags Head, we tried to figure out the schedule, and we soon learned it was impossible. They might put the pipe in one place and then let it sit there for a week while they actually work somewhere else. They might work north from the pipe for 100 feet and then decide to go south for 500 feet before turning back north again. Or the whole project could be delayed for a week if the dredge has engine trouble and needs repairs. This is why they don't give more concrete timelines, because it's an exercise in futility.

Also the last thing the town wants is to get sued by a homeowner for telling a guest to break their lease.

"The bulldozers that move the new sand around work pretty quickly, so if those are in front of your house today, they will likely be down the beach tomorrow. However, your house may be between the pipe coming onshore and where the bulldozers are working today. So you'll have a big metal pipe in running the length of the beach between your house and the ocean. The good news is that they make sand ramps so you can walk over the pipe. When they are done with that section of the beach, the bulldozers come back and take the pipe apart.

Sometimes there is a delay for whatever reason, and the contractor is usually pretty good about making the roped off work zone as small as possible during those delays. But so many things are uncertain that they can't always predict how long a delay will last so the worst case scenario is that the work zone is in front of a house for more than a day. This is typically because the dredge is not working, so as a result, the bulldozers are not out there working 24/7 because there is no sand to move around. In this kind of situation, you can still walk around the work zone and get to the ocean.

Out of the thousands of people who are impacted by beach nourishment, only a handful will have even that mild inconvenience.

"From Dare County's [Beach Nourishment FAQs](https://www.darenc.com/government/beach-nourishment/frequently-asked-questions) page:

**Will I still be able to get to the beach while the project is underway?**

Residents and visitors will still be able to access the beach while the projects are taking place; however, a portion of the approximately 1,000-foot area that is actively under construction at any given time may be closed temporarily in order to ensure public safety.

If construction operations limit or restrict access to the beach directly in front of your property, you may need to enter the beach at an alternate beach access. 

Beach nourishment construction operations are anticipated to impact the properties along a particular stretch of shoreline for a period of three to six days, although this can change depending on a variety of factors. Once that section of sand is pumped into place, the area will likely be reopened for use within 24-48 hours. 

Sand ramps will be placed over a temporary pipeline at every public access and then in intervals of 200-300 feet, allowing people to safely get past the equipment and enjoy the beach on the ocean side of the pipeline.

1. Call the Town of Kitty Hawk to find out where they are going to start
2. Give them the address (of your rental), give them the date of your stay

"If your talking Hatteras island, most waterfront restaurants are on the sound side of the island and they vary town to town. I've never seen a ocean front one on Hatteras island, but maybe I haven't looked hard enough.

The best way to think about Hatteras island(Avon, Buxton, Frisco, Hatteras village...etc) is to think a more cottagey feel, less busy, more mom and pop restaurants(compared to anything near Kitty Hawk). My wife and I are in our late 20s/early 30s and we've vacationed in the OBX for probably 6 years now. We've stayed all over Hatteras island in Waves, Hatteras, Avon, and Frisco so far. Each town has certain pros and cons. Avon has the bigger grocery store(which is a huge plus) and is probably one of the bigger towns from my experience. Buxton is the other bigger town (which has the smaller grocery store). Neither towns are really that busy, at least compared to the towns north on Bodie Island(Kitty Hawk, Kill Devil Hills...etc)

All in all, I'm a huge fan of the ""up north"" experience (Michigan reference) you get from vacationing on Hatteras island. Bodie Island is a lot more touristy comparatively to Hatteras island. I'm a big fan of the mom and pop restaurants on Hatteras and they've always been pretty solid. It's honestly fun to just drive up and down highway 12 and find new places to eat in different towns. Also if you have a 4x4 truck(with a permit that you get online) it's awesome to get take out and drive straight on the beach and eat. That's probably as good as it gets.

Also cool thing about Outer Banks is all the fresh catch fish places. You can pick out fresh fish, shrimp or crab depending on the place, and some will even season and steam it for you. Some places each have big gallon drums filled with seafood and potatoes..etc.. that you can take to your place steam on the stovetop, which is awesome too.

"

I'm bringing a 12 foot wannabe heaver, 11 foot spinning, and an 8.7 foot telescopic spinning. I've got all my mono line, hooks, and pyramid sinkers, and everything i could think of (except live bait).I almost wanted to bring a cast net for the bait..but that might be overkill as far as plane luggage.

I was actually kind if tempted to look for a fishing tour guide of some sort just for this but did not want to put much effort since it is a poorly planned trip already. That is not a bad idea at all for a local entrepreneur who would be the type of person not worried about ""side eye"" from local haters 😉. Being that i also am someone who has secret spots, i can understand locals wanting to protect their territories. But maybe since the ocean always shifts the terrain around eventually maybe that is not really a tangible thing anyone can keep for themselves. Of course surf fishing would not be as productive as a charter boat .. but in this scenario.. if the tour guide were to take people out on their 4x4 it would kind of be just like a charter boat.

"I've kind of been wondering for years now, why there isn't a Cape Point ""guide service"" for times like today and yesterday when there's a big blob of red drum off the point, to take folks out and get in on the action.  I mean maybe locals would give you the side eye for it, but it takes a lot for a casual angler to get to the big fish at the point.

4WD, beach driving permit, heaver rod, know how to drive in the sand, etc.

For someone who just wants to sample surf fishing here, I would probably park at the old lighthouse parking lot and walk out to the beach.  You'll be a little north of Cape Point so you probably won't catch any bull reds like they do in that spot, but you might catch some solid puppy drum or slot drum.  I've caught some good ones there.

I don't like getting in the scrum with 100 other guys chucking sinkers and big hooks on top of each other anyway, I typically will park here:  
[https://goo.gl/maps/PDSqvudwUW3o2PfW6](https://goo.gl/maps/PDSqvudwUW3o2PfW6)

No 4WD required, and I will walk out a ways south of the jetty by the old lighthouse site.  About 600-700 yards south of there, the sandbar breaks up (it's a moving target, sand shifts, you will have to walk it to see it if you can read waves).  Just throw out there.  

It's perfectly manageable if you travel light with a single rod, folding chair, and an Engel-size cooler for bait.  You don't need a big heaver rod to hit the sandbar in the spot I'm talking about, but you want at least an 10' rod.  Save money on renting a 4x4 and dodge the crowds if you are just getting your feet wet.  If the big school of drum is lingering into Friday could be a nice day without much competition in the spot I'm talking about.  Not sure how they will react to rain today/tomorrow.

"Ha, sorry if that was implied.  Plenty of school buses for all of the schools here, and bus stops throughout Colington.

"First of all, if you need a real estate agent I'd love to help you find your way here.  My first suggestion to anyone thinking about relocating is to buy a house, don't get involved in the long-term rental scene.  Once you know you won't have to move again (unless YOU want to) it takes such a burden off your mind.

We have a daughter in school here, she loves it and it's a great community of parents, teachers and kids in all the schools here, but the most convenient for parents is probably First Flight (elementary/middle/high).  u/OBXLivingKDHStyle is 100% right if you buy something in Nags Head, your kids would go to school in Manteo rather than KDH.  So instead of what might be a 5 minute drive in the morning on your way to work or coffee, you would be driving them 15 minutes into Manteo.  Just something to keep in mind, look at the maps when you're looking at houses.  They don't make many exceptions to zoning maps, if you are in Nags Head your kids will go to Manteo every day, if you are just over the bridge from Southern Shores they will go to Currituck every day.  Obviously you didn't list Corolla so I assume you are familiar with the plight of Corolla parents and their school situation.  :)

I'm a member of the YMCA, if you live in KDH it's a short drive over.  Lots of classes and kids programs, one of the better YMCAs I've been with across NC.  A couple of other gyms here, multiple martial arts places (my kiddo goes to one).  The kids at First Flight have an after school thing at the rec center (walking distance from the school) and there are other options available if they don't want to hang out there.

If I could make any suggestions on where to live, pick something back near Colington in KDH, Bay Drive, or the Seascape/Duck Woods areas in Kitty Hawk/Southern Shores.  Lots of families, walking spaces, easy to get out and enjoy living at the beach.  There are some great soundside fishing areas back near Colington, it's a gated community back there with a community pool and you can keep a little boat in the back yard.  Take the kids out fishing.  Enjoy the convenience of dropping them off at First Flight Elementary an First Flight Middle on your way to wherever you will be going, and reeeeelaxxxxx.  So many people move here and don't know how to decompress and spend 3 hours fishing in the evening, or take a boat out for an hour and just cruise around with the family.  I don't know if they realize they can take an evening stroll on a mostly empty beach anytime they feel stressed.  That's 90% of making it here - mindset.  I moved direct to Avon from western NC and was used to having a Target and a Taco Bell on every corner.  I couldn't believe how remote and isolated it was, it was really jarring for me and I wasn't real happy here until the owner of our company told me to slow down and said you don't have anywhere to go, you're already here - enjoy it.

Most of our ""adult friends"" came from living back in Colington, or they had kids the same age as ours.  It's easy to meet people and make friends here, and if you live in the KDH/Kitty Hawk area you will be central to most everything there is to do.

"Yeah, I'm really into cycling and being on the beach and would really like to get into kayaking and maybe kayak fishing in the sound.

"Born and raised DC moved down two years ago. Got a 4 and 6 year old. Absolutely love it. Highly suggest KDH as it's central to everything. Don't move to Duck or Corolla as you will be in crazy traffic 2/3 of the year and not to mention single road access. If you had an emergency it would be a hectic ride getting all the way to the hospital. Nags head goes to school in Manteo so I don't suggest that unless you want to drive to the mainland every day. All the school districts are great. Most would argue first flight elementary is the ""best"" but splitting hairs if you ask me. There are day care/after school care options but not as many as you would think. 

I could go on for a long time but the most important thing is if you truly love the beach you will absolutely love it. I highly suggest getting into fishing as the possibilities are endless.

"There is no affordable housing here. Not even on the mainland.  Rent is insane.  We bought a foreclosure here in 2008 during the real estate bubble implosion, and have watched things get crazy starting in 2020 (go figure).  We just got lucky, that’s all. I’ve been watching prices just out of boredom, and for renting one room with a bath in someone’s house is around $1200., no pets, no nothing, no furniture.  Currituck and Dare counties are not in the mood to approve the permits for constructing affordable housing because they are greedy.

I had to move here for work and bought an RV to live in.

"The reality is that, as an (assumingly) unskilled employee, it's hard to make it here. Not that you can't, but know that it's going to be tough.

First thing's first, housing is a bitch. It may be expensive in Portland, but here in the Outer Banks, it's nonexistent. Your best bet is to find an employer that provides housing (kitty hawk kites, some restaurants) and go full time to secure that. Then branch out and meet locals that may be looking for a roommate.

The work thing brings me to point number two. Don't blow all your money in the summer! While you can make a full years living here in 6-8 months, if you don't save, you'll have trouble making it through the winter. Things are progressively becoming more year round but work is still very much feast or famine, especially in tourist supporting industries such as restaurants, horse tours, lifeguarding, and other jobs. 

The pros are that this area is naturally beautiful. I'm from a big Midwest city myself, and the surf, fishing, kayaking, water lifestyle and quick access to the nature is unmatched. There's nothing like being a short bike ride from the beach, seeing a bait ball and running to your truck to grab a rod to catch some dinner, watching a front pass offshore as the winds clear up or turn on.

The last thing I'll mention is to avoid heavy substance abuse. It's not spoken about much, but substancw abuse has an 8-20 times higher occurrence among locals in resort towns than in the general population. So keep your partying in check. Not to say don't have a good time, but I've seen people show up to the Outer Banks all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to take life by the horns, only to fall into the trap of drinking all summer long, blowing through their savings, and scrambling through the winter (which they spend mostly drinking) in order to make it to the next summer season.


WITH ALL OF THAT SAID

This place is a great opportunity to use as a jumping board for the rest of your life. I've seen people move on to being physician's assistants, starting their own businesses, traveling internationally, building homes and starting lives and families here on the beach. Tons of others have used the experience of working and living here to excel in other areas of the world. Just remember to find GOOD people to keep around you and it will be an amazing place full of opportunities.

"Use crosswalks to cross the road and ONLY WHEN YOU CAN SAFELY DO SO. We have a bunch of pedestrian and cyclist accidents and deaths each year on the OBX. And also when you're driving, if you see someone in the crosswalk, by law you are required to stop until they are out of the crosswalk, not just your lane. 

Also, when coming down 64 into Mann's Harbor, shortly after it widens to a four lane road, the speed limit drops from 55 to 40. It is 40 for a half mile or so until you get on the Virginia Dare Bridge, which is 60. So you should also note that when coming off of the VDB into Mann's Harbor the speed is dropping for 60 to 40.

"I'd suggest staying in Manteo and taking one of your days to drive down to Hatteras, only because of when you're coming down. I think Buxton would be better if you planned on spending a lot of your time at the beach, but with unpredictable weather, Manteo is probably a better home base for exploring. There's restaurants, coffee, shops, and a nice water walk right there for you to check out. Buxton might still be hit or miss on who and what is open.

Someone mentioned Tortugas Lie, and I second that as well, but our favorite spot is Kill Devil Grill. The food is amazing, the desserts are incredible (the only place I ever save room for dessert), and the service is top notch. These are all within a 20 min drive of Manteo.

As far as things to do, I'd suggest seeing any and all the lighthouses, the Wright Bros memorial, and if they're doing wild horse tours in Corolla, I'd definitely look into that too. There is an awesome shop called Seagreen Gallery with a ton of awesome local stuff, as well as the Kill Devil Hills co-op, with tons of local art.

Further north is Carova, but you’ll need a 4x4 to drive on the beach to get there just watch out for the wild horses. This time of year you can drive on the beach even in Corolla.

Technically not supposed to camp on the beach. you can be out there 24 hours a day but actually setting up a tent overnight is illegal. do they really enforce it? Probably not because there are very few actual park rangers on duty at any given time. If they did catch you most of them are pretty laid back and would just make you pack up the tent or leave the beach altogether.

"Midge patterns are very hard to figure out - they don't ""happen"" every year, but when a hatch occurs, it is a miserable few days for homes in the wrong location or with areas they find attractive for shelter from the wind.

I think last year was particularly bad - I had to photograph one house for a listing that I literally could not enter the porch on the leeward side lest I breathe them in - it was like nothing I've seen in 27 years here.

"Hatteras Island is a great place to live.  And now that the jug handle bridge is up, you will skip most of the road washouts that cut off the island from the rest of the Outer Banks.  Hopefully.

If you can find something on the ridge in Buxton between the Buxton side of Indiantown and the Inn at Pamlico Sound, that's the ""no headaches"" zone.  You won't have to worry about water if you're on that ridge.  For everything else, just get a house on pilings and move your car to high ground if you know a storm is coming.  I lived by Spa Koru for a few years and thought flood water would never reach me there.  So I didn't move the brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee.  One flooded (and totaled) vehicle later, I always moved the cars to the Avon post office.  But I've even seen water there since the beach has been washed away, hopefully beach nourishment fixes it.  But there are a lot of little things like that where locals know what to do and it will take a little while to adjust.  But once you do, it becomes second nature.

Soundside flooding happens more often from Frisco to Waves, nor'easters tear up the shoreline from Rodanthe to Avon.  Hurricanes are more likely to hit from Hatteras village to Buxton.  I've seen the entire sound sucked out at the Scotch Bonnet (boats sitting in the mud at the marina) and 30 minutes later those boats are across the street.  When a hurricane moves over Hatteras Island it pushes all the sound water out and once the eye passes, pushes all of the sound water back in.  

It's pretty wild, but if I'm being honest, I love it and I miss it.  It might be a little jarring during the first couple of big storms but you really do get used to it, and infrastructure is a lot better now than it was when I lived there.  

Let's just say I keep an eye on new listings in Buxton, if I see a good one on the ridge pop up, I might be back!",t2_5lse5jyh,SOLDontheOuterBanks,0,1646802365.0,0,t1_hzxqkax,hzxqkax,True,Terrible_Trader_,t3_t8252q,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/t8252q/one_more_housing_question_wavesavon/,One more housing question Waves/Avon,/r/obx/comments/t8252q/one_more_housing_question_wavesavon/hzxqkax/,2,r/obx,0,2

I had to look into this extensively last summer when my grandparents vehicle had mechanical issues 2 days before we left for Ocracoke. We were looking to see if any rental places allowed driving on the beach and absolutely none of the normal ones did and there were no rental places that offered off road rentals. We were not willing to pay the cost to rent an SUV and then pay an additional $700+ for the week for another off road rental offered on the island. It was also during the the height of the rental car shortage and the prices were sky high as it was.

"We bring down as much food as we can. With the amount of people we go with it's much easier to buy in bulk at a Costco or BJs. We fill up huge totes with the non-frozen/refrigerated food. We haven't had any issue with food being in a cooler, even after a 12 hour car ride. Lots of ice, plus the frozen food helps keep the refrigerated food colder. When we used to stop overnight in Virginia we would put dry ice in the coolers. The only food we don't purchase ahead of time is produce and dairy-related food items (milk, yogurt, eggs, etc). We stop at a veggie stand on the way down for produce. And we stop at an obx food store (Food Lion for us) for the dairy items when we get on the island. The grocery stores are a pain because they are so crowded with long lines. Even getting the few items we needed it was a hassle.

"Full disclosure we don’t live down there yet. We’ve been in the longest ever closing process for our house in Avon which is an outlier by real estate standards.

That aside I joined the Facebook groups to keep an eye on stuff like this and to get a better idea of happenings in the community for when we finally move. Most common I see is right around the Buxton motel, parts of hatteras and Frisco get overwqsh pretty often when there’s high, sustained winds pushing the water over the dunes. The worst of it this past year seems to have come from the nor’easter where there was about 1-2 feet of standing water on the roads across much of hatteras and parts of Avon.

Parts of the s curve and north of road the get overwash as well but that’s what the bridge is partially solving for.

As u/obxtalldude said where you are located matters too. Ocean side of NC12 in Avon, Rodanthe, Waves, and Salvo is going to get more exposure and this have more risk for erosion / flooding. Likewise if you’re soundside right on the water in a low lying area you’ll have issues with flooding there too.

Just closing my opinion piece I’ll say that the locals have told me that as long as you’re okay with the occasional 1-2 days being cutoff from the mainland then just be sure you find a place that is:

* Elevated at least a couple feet
* Ideally not super low lying, but location probably matters here too

"Yes that is pretty much the ideal version of beach nourishment. They decide where the pipe will come ashore and then work in one direction for a while, then move to the other direction. The Nags Head project had two dredges,, but for various reasons they weren't always working at the same time. The major wrench in the works is that things break on the dredges (as well as the support craft) and they have to go to Norfolk for repairs. And then everything stops. The contractor did a good job of reducing their overall footprint so to speak, but they have to pile up the pipes and fencing somewhere. They also can't work in certain conditions such as high winds or particularly big waves, which is why it can't be done in the off-season, when we have frequent northeasters.

Some other fun facts if you are interested: 

There are two types of dredge for a project like this: a hopper dredge and a suction dredge. The hopper dredge goes to the borrow site, sucks up a load of sand, then sails back to the pipe, hooks up and pushes all the sand through the pipe to the beach. While the bulldozers move the sand around, the dredge goes back to get another load from the borrow site. 

A suction dredge can suck up sand from the borrow site directly into the pipe, so there is a more continuous flow of sand to the beach. It's a big time-saver, but only works when the borrow site is close enough to the beach. I spent a lot of time on the beach that summer and got to the point I could identify the different dredges by their silhouettes. 

Also when the pipe extends a ways down the beach, they build sand ramps for people to walk over it. They are pretty substantial ramps that anyone planning on going in the ocean wouldn't have a problem walking over. Kids tend to find the whole thing really cool.

They station people at the north and south ends of the work zone to keep people out of the dangerous area. Sometimes you can ask them questions and they will have interesting or useful information. They can't predict the future because of all the variables of course. Also you can still walk on the beach up by the dune, so long walks on the beach are still an option!",t2_13noi9,Albert_Im_Stoned,0,1646594350.0,0,t1_hzlz5sw,hzlz5sw,False,shingdao,t3_t6v95v,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/t6v95v/nags_head_beach_restoration_project_update/,Nags Head Beach Restoration Project Update,/r/obx/comments/t6v95v/nags_head_beach_restoration_project_update/hzlz5sw/,1,r/obx,0,1

"Thank you.  I'm wondering if you would be willing to share a little bit about the process you observed last time.  

My understanding is that they typically begin at a mid-point about 1000 yards in each direction they want to work, they then set-up and stage the equipment at that midpoint, and then begin dredging on one side for 1000 yards until done and then move to the other side of the midpoint for another 1,000 yards.

I've read that it can take a week or more to complete both sections (2,000 yards in total) before they move down or up the beach depending on which direction they are working to do another section...I understand they then have to move the dredge and underwater pipes so that can take some time.  

Is this all more or less correct?

"There's two types of flooding locally in general - one is dependent on the actual address, and is generally caused a by high water table / lots of rain / low elevation or being at the base of a dune which acts like a sponge when it rains, then slowly releases the water around it's base. 

Be super careful selecting the house - you do NOT want to live in a place that floods every bad rain.  High ground is key, especially for parking cars during storms. 

The other type is wind driven sound water.  Much more widespread, generally puts portions of Rt. 12 under water.  Usually happens after a hurricane or other strong low passes, and we get western or north west winds that push the sound water over the island in spots.

It usually goes away within 24 hours of the winds dying, but can last longer if there was a lot of rain in addition to the wind driven water. 

There are certainly year round folks in every town, but it's much more integrated on the Northern Beaches.

"Time of year, kid age and your covid concerns make this tough but a couple things:

1.  The water is going to be COLD.  Don't kill yourself, the rents, or the kids.  This is a serious comment because it does sound like you are pretty clueless.
2. I can't think of anyone that is going to have outside dining that week.  Still too early.  I'd suggest calling around.  Def call though, just because it says it on a facebook page don't take it for gospel.
3. Dowdy park is awesome for the kids. (about 30 minutes away from you - north)
4. Can go watch the boats come in to OI in the afternoon.  Won't be a ton going out but they should have some charters running if the weather is good enough to go off-shore
5. If you are into wildlife you can drive Alligator NWR.    You'll probably see a couple of bears.
6. Drive down to the ferry and maybe take a trip across
7. Go to wright memorial
8. Go to dunes

Other than that.  Go to the grocery store, buy a bunch of grub, hang out at your vacation rental, spend amazing quality time with the family, walk the beach, pick up shells,  put together puzzles, play some cards and board games, watch some tv, cook out every night, bullshit about life, do some drinking and hopefully enjoy some decent weather.

"Most of the seasonal restaurants have said they are opening from the beginning to middle of March this year.  Check on their FB page(s) but you should be in pretty decent shape for food.  And it won't be crowded, or less crowded these days I guess, which is a plus.

I saw your comment on a Sunset cruise.  Depending on the weather March can be a fantastic time to get out on a boat.  Check with DownEast (sail) and Cypress (motor yacht) in Manteo.  There are a few others as well.   A heads up that most folks will only take out 6 passengers (due to their license).  Don't believe any of the 6+ boats are open yet, they typically open in April.

Also, realize that you will be an hour from your house when you are in Manteo.  Lots of folks miss that for some reason.

My suggestion for an ideal south day with kids.

930/10AM - Aquarium

12pm - Mama Kwans or Tortuga's Lie for lunch

2pm - Head to Manteo Waterfront for Sunset Cruise, walk around downtown and waterfront, shop, etc., etc..

"The central beach areas - like Nags Head, Kill Devil Hills and Kitty Hawk - have a lot more tucked away places than you might have seen as a vacationer. Kitty Hawk Road winds back through the trees to Kitty Hawk Landing, while Kill Devil Hills has the beautiful neighborhoods around Bay Drive. Colington Harbour isn't the only community on Colington Island: there are several hidden gems like Baycliff or Waters Edge. Nags Head has tons of soundside neighborhoods that range from forested to windswept.

The only draw back to Nags Head is that the kids go to Manteo Middle and High schools, while from KDH north, they go to First Flight Middle and High schools (the elementary school districts are a little more complicated). As someone else said, Manteo is a more insular place with kind of a small town attitude. First Flight has all the beach kids from families who moved here in the last 30 years, rather than families that have been here for 400 years and will let you know about it!

"You'll find the most open community in the KDH / Colington area - lots of other transplants looking to make friends, lots of activities, lots of social stuff, plenty of kids around, and easy access to the schools.

Manteo is a bit more insular and traditional, with a small town feel rather than a beach vibe. 

Down south is a different place - you can be cut off from the Northern Beaches for days at a time with flooded roads, there are not a lot of year round people so you'll know everyone, not sure how else to describe it - I think it's a love it or hate it place to live.  

Nature is everywhere, and I especially like the Nags Head and Kitty Hawk Woods preserves - both incredible for trail running, hiking, biking, even hunting in Kitty Hawk.  I generally get my fill of Hatteras Island with some beach days to Pea Island or an overnight at Frisco Woods.  

Good luck with your move!  If I can offer once piece of advice - pay close attention to flooding patterns from storms wherever you consider - living on high ground that slopes away from the house is often overlooked, and some seemingly dry areas can get two feet of water after storms if they are at the bottom of a big dune.",t2_10oi4b,obxtalldude,0,1645126473.0,0,t1_hxcjmaz,hxcjmaz,True,Terrible_Trader_,t3_suvdx8,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/suvdx8/proscons_of_a_few_different_areas/,Pros/cons of a few different areas,/r/obx/comments/suvdx8/proscons_of_a_few_different_areas/hxcjmaz/,11,r/obx,0,11

"i work at island garden center in buxton and our rule is if planted with a little shelter they'll do fine. they are not terribly salt tolerant,

wouldn't recommend as a hedge, salty wind will beat them up 

since theres no nutrients in the sand, you really should add potting or garden soil to whatever you plant down here

but if you wanna try - snag a 1 cubic foot bag of garden soil per plant (depending on size of the plant), dig yer hole half again as deep as the garden pot the plant is in, put 3-4 inches in the bottom of the hole, mix the rest of the soil with the sand and back fill the plant.

**ahsvillin** comment on oleander is right - look great, grow fairly quick but are toxic to animals

another option you may wanna look at would be russian olives (Elaeagnus angustifolia)- really fast growing, can get to about 10-15 ft tall x 8 feet wide, and make an instant hedge, to keep them a hedge you'll need to keep a good trim going. blooms in summer and have a real nice fragrance",t2_2ophk384,mike_obx,0,1644770403.0,0,t1_hwslxyf,hwslxyf,True,Short_Elderberry1611,t3_sr3z7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/sr3z7v/landscaping_with_hydrangeas/,Landscaping with Hydrangeas,/r/obx/comments/sr3z7v/landscaping_with_hydrangeas/hwslxyf/,1,r/obx,0,1

"Literally anywhere from Corolla to Frisco will have a ripple for you to ride on the right tide in October. It’s possible for some bigger swells that time of the year also. 

Rodanthe, Avon, and Buxton will usually be slightly bigger than Nags Head, Kill Devil Hills, and Kitty Hawk (and Corolla), but if you’re just beginning then bigger is not always better.

If you are used to the Carolina Beach atmosphere, I would recommend staying between Kitty Hawk and Nags head and just making a day trip south if you want to search for some different/better waves. There will be more to do when not on the beach as in restaurants, shops, etc.

Surfing crowds will be minimal this time of year and there are plenty of sandbars to go around so don’t go out right on top of someone else!

People can't travel to other countries for the most part, and flying anywhere has become an unattractive option, so more people than usual are opting to drive to the Outer Banks for their vacation.

Plus lots of people who can work remotely have bought homes down here in the last two years, often taking another vacation home off the rental market, so supply is down as demand is up.

"The beaches were private property until NPS came into the picture and obtained the land in the early 20th century, mostly thru donation. Locals still pretty much had the run of the NPS land until environmental and wildlife advocacy groups sued NPS in the early 2000s for not properly protecting endangered wildlife, primarily shorebirds such as piping plovers, as required under various laws and regulations. So NPS ‘stepped up’ (by instituting resource protection areas and adding rules like banning night driving on the beach) and locals did not appreciate that. Hence the intense dislike for NPS although it has definitely improved in the past decade and a half. Plus the majority of Hatterassers have a distrust for government agencies.

"Corolla is cool.  It’s just too nice for me.  

The development company (now I'm sure worth many millions) runs their investments there like each house is their own child. It's a case study for Harvard. They are beyond the beyond. It's just too good for this New Yorker.  Everything works! Have an issue?  They'll be there with full crew in 60 seconds or less. Or close too. At least that was my experience. 

Every blade of grass is manicured. For parents with kids, I'm sure it's a +10x100.

I love crazy encounters with those hardcore surfers. Just back from Sumatra, his world class surfer girlfriend by his side.  With dreadlocks baby in tow, and that “whatever dude, we just surf. Get  stoned. And trade crypto. Peru next month, then North Shore.”

When the waves get insane, and the red flags come out, DANGER NO SWIMMING! they just appear, boards and sails in hand, and off they fly. While us on the beach say ""WTF, are they insane? they're crazy! they're going to die out there! That guy just flew up higher than a skyscraper and just crashed in the ocean, buried, and he's doing it again!""  When the wind and waves die down, they just disappear. Gone. No trace. Until the next storm rolls in. And appear again they do. It's kind of magical.

I would tell you to steer clear of the Hampton just because it's a very sterile environment. It looks and feels like every other chain hotel out there. Not to mention it's pretty far from anything to do other than the beach out front. 

Also be aware that, because of the weekly rental programs that most realty companies use, Saturday and Sunday traffic is usually pretty bad.

ya its the best place - no shit thats why the people are coming.  it was awesome as a secret.  but now more and more people know.

its just game theory.  eventually it will hit the equilibrium between awesomeness and peoples interest in it.  i think its way under that point.  so its only going to get worse.  prepare yourself.  and it only makes sense.  it sucks but makes sense.

"there are no bad guys.  the outer banks has been an oasis that was little known comparatively to what it would be if people knew about it and the affordability.  now people know. theyre going to come there.  and they will win.

families who have rented there for generations and raised their kids there will be kicked out.  the punishment for never owning the land.  the world is finding out what the outer banks is and they are going to take it.  the locals will become ex-locals.

they should have been landowners.  tale as old as time.  even landowners will be priced out because their property valuation will go up an insane value and they will have to pay the taxes on it.  of course theyll get a nice payout but that means they are uprooted and kicked off the island and they cant have their next family generation live there because they werent productive enough.  and now they have a payout but have to find a new life and pay for a new house somewhere else, taking the whole payout unless they move somewhere worse.

its all very logical and very impersonal.  and that what you were saying but i just want you to fully understand the implications of what you ""believe"".  people with more money/means see a nice space they will take it.  and thats happening.  just as it always has.

its called gentrification and it means moving people out of a spot that the more wealthier think is nice.  pay their landlords more, pay off property owners for their land, raise property valuations thereby raisin taxes.",t2_7jf9ud1,thehoesmaketheman,0,1643871264.0,0,t1_hve29hq,hve29hq,False,SoyOrbison87,t3_sdiqbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/sdiqbk/please_boycott_the_airbnbs_of_obx/,Please boycott the Airbnbs of OBX,/r/obx/comments/sdiqbk/please_boycott_the_airbnbs_of_obx/hve29hq/,3,r/obx,0,3

"I posted on your original thread but thought I'd pop in here with the statistics portion of my post:

For perspective:  
\- In 2021, Cape Hatteras National Seashore had 3.1 million visitors.  
\- In 2021, Dare County saw 400,000 - 450,000 visitors each week.  
\- In 2018 Dare County averaged 200,000 - 250,000 unique visitors each week.  
\- Hatteras has a year round population of \~4,500 people.  
\- Dare County itself has \~35,000 residents but not all of those are on the beach. A resident in Stumpy Point, for example, would have to drive well over an hour to get to Avon.

Don't forget quite a few of the people in those population numbers are kids, elderly, or disabled and the number of people who are capable of working drops significantly. We just, quite literally, don't have the bodies to keep things operational for the number of visitors we get each year.

Now, keep in mind those population numbers!

Dare County has 35,000 dwellings. That's it. 35,000 homes, condos, apartments, whatever, for the same number of people.

Of those 35,000 dwellings, 20,000 are vacation homes (2nd homes and rentals).

Based on occupancy tax records, Airbnb and similar companies are becoming a significant part of the rental market and a direct challenge to local property managers. Unlike local PMs, Airbnbs can be homes that were converted into apartments or converted/add-on units.

The part that makes me extra depressed, though, is the part where my BFF lives in a decent, non-stabby part of Brooklyn in a new construction elevator building close to the subway and the rent he pays for his 2 bedroom is LESS than what a friend pays for a crumbling (frankly gross), tiny studio apartment in Salvo (that's supposed to be subsidized by her employer).

And let's not forget just how low local wages are but how the cost of living is the 3rd highest in NC!

"We just don't have enough locals or affordable housing here, so most cleaners are driving in for the day. When I was privvy to such details, there were more weeks than not that nearly every cleaner drove 100+ miles just to clean for the day. Some are great and work all summer, others will show up once and you never hear from them ever again. It's an extremely stressful push to try and get everything clean and inspected for check-ins but to try and do it understaffed? Oooof.

I saw you mentioned elsewhere about what the rental companies pay. It tends to be per house based on an hourly rate and the approximate amount of time it should take a cleaner or team of cleaners to properly clean. Unfortunately, those times are built around the idea that the house isn't completely wrecked and with the goal of getting all properties turned over and ready for check-ins as early in the day as possible. (People are NOT nice about having to wait until 6pm even if that's the time homes are guaranteed.) I think it generally averages $20/hour. Some companies offer travel pay too and, of course, incentives if you work x number of weeks, etc.

It's a completely shit job in every possible way. Shit to organize, shit to find the staff, shit to do the actual cleaning. It really sucks that the shittiness of all of it sometimes funnels down to the guest. Unless something changes the number of homes that can be vacation rentals, I don't know how the system can be improved.

"We had the same issue - only our house went up 74%! Totally out of our budget. We were so upset and the realty company offered no empathy or options. They said property owners can set the price at whatever they want and that we would lose our deposit and there is a waitlist for the houses. We were willing to lose the deposit but couldn't find anything else that met our needs so we resentfully paid the $. We will not be returning next year 2023 on principle alone. I understand a price increase and that this year has been even harder for property owners and insurance companies, but marking up a rental 74% is outrageous and seems like price gauging.

"Reading this made me smile.  I was your age the first time I went to OBX with a friend and her family, who went every year.  I absolutely loved it there.  It was so much more laid back than the local beachy town about 2 hours away from my home town.  We went to the beach, rode our bikes to the Food Lion and back to the house.  Did some shopping, visited Ocracoke island, we sat in the hot tub each night, played cards, went fishing, rode bikes again!  It was such a great time.  For years, I always said ""when I'm old enough to go with my friends, I'm going to do it every year!""  And for the past 8 years, that's what I've done.

"I brought my road bike with me in the fall of 2020 when we stayed in KDH near the Wright Bros memorial. I would ride the sound side (path and road), then cut through Southern Shores, then ride the path or road up to Corolla. Generally it was fine that time of year. The section from SS to Duck along the path is not ideal for road bike speeds, so extra caution there at any crossings (so many).   


A couple times I rode from SS to KDH on the ocean side along the main road. A few aggressive trucks made this annoying, combined with trash cans bloc the shoulder. But I was doing this midday in the fall, might be fine first thing in the am 

Obviously summer has thicker crowds, and between that and summer heat, I’d probably try to ride at first light. You‘d be done by the time the bulk of people get out and about.

Though the pizza sauce also plays a role. I've noticed a lot of pizzerias in the OBX have a kind of sweet flavor to the dough and sauce, which is going to turn off folks looking for NYC style. Its a very regional preference.

"Carova is packed in June. It's an absolute mess. A lot of stop and go. Particularly at any bottle necks. It's a really rough ride because there are so many trucks creating so many tracks so you have to go slow as fuck. Then you have to worry about it being safe to park and get out. 

I have been several times in the off-season and it's outstanding. Not a whole lot of cars out there. Smooth ride so you can go fairly fast. No congestion. And it's safe to stop and chill. 

As for driving, just use common sense. Take your time and go slow at first. Don't spin your tires. When you cut across the tracks it gets super bumpy and you can damage your front end if you're going too fast. After you do that a couple times slowly you can feel out what feels safe. Of course deflate your tires. Take your front license plate off. I always make sure to have a shovel and some tow straps in case I get stuck. 

I encourage you to go up in the town but be careful driving through the standing water. Some of that shit gets super deep. Your best bet is to get behind somebody that looks like they know what they're doing and follow them. Let them be the sacrificial lamb. Have fun. Be safe. Use common sense.

"Your best—or possibly only bet is to find a job that offers housing opportunities for summer employee's. A number of property management companies from Corolla to Hatteras do this. May be worth reaching out a bunch of them to inquire about this. Second to that, I'd check with some of equipment rental places. I know KHK was mentioned, which advertises housing as a benefit, but there a many other rental places. I've heard some of them do similar things. Also, maybe look into Food Lion on Hatteras Island. They have employee  housing in Avon. May be a good option also if you're looking for jobs with night shift options where you can take advantage of daylight hours more.

Short term housing, especially during the summer, is almost impossible to find outside of an employer connection here. Impossible. If you can't find an employer option your best bet is to post on CL or Facebook about renting out a room from someone, though I know many of those folks are now doing AirBnB's with them. And obviously be wary of scammers.

"First, all NC beaches are public up to the dune line. However, you can't cross private property to get there and some areas have easier public access than others. Overall, the further south you go the better and easier the access will be. Duck and Southern Shores are generally terrible if you aren't staying in a neighborhood with an access. Kitty Hawk and KDH have more public access but parking is tough and they don't have sidewalks. Nags Head has plentiful access and a nice multiuse path on the beach road. South of Oregon Inlet things really open up but within towns you will have the same issue of private neighborhood accesses and no parking in some areas.

If you want to lug a bunch of stuff and kids to the beach in high season north of Oregon Inlet you need to get to an access early. 

Also a heads up, the water quality in the sound is pretty bad and much worse than the ocean. That little sand strip at Jockeys Ridge has some of the worst water quality of any NC beach (ocean, sound, or river). It had unsafe fecal bacteria levels nearly 25% of the days tested in 2020 and I bet that is higher now with the increased shoulder and off-season demand.",t2_rmiti,Howardeg,0,1641744908.0,0,t1_hrxfxmh,hrxfxmh,True,vgal48,t3_rzl9ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/rzl9ep/obx_questions/,OBX Questions,/r/obx/comments/rzl9ep/obx_questions/hrxfxmh/,1,r/obx,0,1

"There are several public access paths to the beaches in Southern Shores, but only a couple of them have parking nearby that I know of. Chicahauk beach (at the first traffic light coming from Kitty Hawk direction, parking is on chicahauk trail to the left) and Triangle Park (Where ocean blvd and Duck road split), there's a parking lot next to the cell tower. I suppose you might need a parking pass? We vacationed in Southern Shores for years, but always rented a beach house and had access out the back door so I'm not sure.

Everyone else is very right, there's a lot more public beach access and infrastructure south towards Kill Devil Hills and Nag's Head than there is anywhere north of there.",t2_50who,Gecko23,0,1641742922.0,0,t1_hrxau3w,hrxau3w,False,vgal48,t3_rzl9ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/obx/comments/rzl9ep/obx_questions/,OBX Questions,/r/obx/comments/rzl9ep/obx_questions/hrxau3w/,1,r/obx,0,1

"I strongly recommend Nags Head for beaching over KDH. There are more beach accesses with full parking lots, more bath houses, and the beaches are wider and usually significantly less crowded. Look for those small Public Beach Access signs. also recommend staying in Nags Head instead or heading down south to see the Canadian Hole or Salvo Day Use area for sound adventuring/yaking/paddle board whatever. Soundside is better play for sunsets, dogs, and kids often times. And while you are not allowed to trespass on private property to get to the beach, No one owns the (oceanside) beach here.

"I live in KDH and we have dozens of public beach access with parking. If you're trying to go at 10-11 it will be hard to find parking and also after lunch. People come and go all day, so you might have to try a few to find a place. If you rent in certain areas it's easy to walk to the access. The Jockeys Ridge sound access is one of a kind. It is a nightmare to park there in the summer.
