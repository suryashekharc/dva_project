"I go to get fit Davis sport cause it's closest to my house. They have a pool, hot tub, and sauna (and steam room on the men's side) they have two rooms with weights, one room with machines, it's pretty rare that i go in there and have to wait for a turn with the equipment i need. The pool is part of the normal membership fee.

Davis swim and fit is in south Davis. Their sauna is outside and often wasn't turned on. The pool is also colder. Too cold for my pansy butt lol. They have a smaller area to work out, but the equipment is nicer if i remember right. I didn't really lift weights when I was there briefly i just used the pool, but they charge extra for pool access. 

Those are the only 2 i know of.

"So I think there are two types of property owners in Davis.  Corporate and private owners that simply are trying to fill the place for the most money and private owners who actually want to provide a fair price and secure long term tenants who will take care of the place.

With so many applicants for my last two property listings, the issue simply becomes I can't go through and vet everyone.  As such, it becomes a matter of being one of the first to respond and being a solid applicant.  Stable employment, good credit, and a good first impression are what typically land people properties when I interview them.

"I always curious at what happens when a store owner gets old and around retirement age and struggles to run a place which would eventually happen for any one man business. I had dined in a Japanese couple owned Japanese restaurant in SJ where the owner/chef was 75 and at the last years he kept the place open, struggled to operate the restaurant with his wife both in terms of cooking, there was noticeable decline in quality as the cooking just wasn‚Äôt like it used to be items overcooked a little and took a long time. Same with the upkeep and housekeeping with the restaurant and it‚Äôs bathroom. Which Japanese take pride of keeping clean. They eventually changed from Table service to self pickup when food is ready. It appears there will come a time to call it quits for any job even though it‚Äôs hard. For everyone‚Äôs good. And to preserve reputation. That restaurant was also gone a few years I moved away. Some veteran online reviewers who used to had great experience at Redrum also recommended it‚Äôs time the owner shut it down and retire in 2017-19. As if staff are frustrated due to circumstances the owner cannot control and quality is declining maybe it‚Äôs time to retire it even though it‚Äôs sad reality that all good things come to an end.

Sadly Things are this way for many family owned places nowadays with supply chain issues and understaffing.

"TLDR: yes, but make sure your hose has a nozzle that shuts off flow when not in use, and make sure the water flows into your yard, not into the street.

&#x200B;

Davis water use restrictions can be found [here](http://qcode.us/codes/davis/?view=desktop&topic=39-39_02-39_02_045). Those related to car washing:

>(1)    A hose that dispenses potable water to wash a motor vehicle shall be fitted with a shut-off nozzle or device attached to it that causes it to cease dispensing water immediately when not in use.  
>  
>(2)    Potable water shall not be applied directly to driveways and sidewalks unless required for health and safety purposes.

The other consideration is storm water discharge. For residential car washing, that is addressed [here](http://qcode.us/codes/davis/view.php?topic=30-30_02-30_02_020&frames=on). I'm guessing the stormwater program it refers to is [this](http://documents.cityofdavis.org/Media/Default/Documents/PDF/Stormwater/Stormwater%20Leaflet.pdf), which states:

>If you need to wash your vehicle, car wash facilities are best choice because the water is recycled and sent to the wastewater treatment plant for cleaning.

"**[Crescent_Nebula](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crescent_Nebula)** 
 
 >The Crescent Nebula (also known as NGC 6888, Caldwell 27, Sharpless 105) is an emission nebula in the constellation Cygnus, about 5000 light-years away from Earth. It was discovered by William Herschel in 1792. It is formed by the fast stellar wind from the Wolf-Rayet star WR 136 (HD 192163) colliding with and energizing the slower moving wind ejected by the star when it became a red giant around 250,000 to 400,000 years ago. The result of the collision is a shell and two shock waves, one moving outward and one moving inward.

On Saturday and Wednesday there‚Äôs the Farmer‚Äôs Market, which can be fun, especially with friends.

Normally, there‚Äôs events like Picnic Day and Whole Earth in the spring, but we didn‚Äôt have those this year.

"Why the fuck would you chose to live in Davis of all places when you could move anywhere? It's got all the drawbacks of a small town with double the price tag of any of the neighboring towns.

Know a couple things about Davis. 

* The only place in town to buy socks or appliances is Target, and getting that put in was a giant fight. 
* Prices are insane
* The city council does everything it can to foster hostility between drivers and cyclists. Parking down town is intentionally awful. Officially, on record, to: ""Encourage people to bike more"". Ignore the fact that they could just block off down town like they did with the blocks next to campus, they'd rather have the conflict. If a bike runs a stop sign and gets hit by a car in Davis it is the driver's fault and the college kids know it. Saw one shoot through four stop signs in a row at full speed downtown once, there was a cop. All the cop did was honk his horn at the kid. 
* Parking anywhere near the college is impossible. I had an apartment near there and whoever got home later had to park (not exaggerating) half a mile away and walk home because the whole neighborhood was permit parking and we only had one assigned spot. 
* I have never had to deal with so many nosy people anywhere else. If you want privacy be in your home, shades drawn, radio off, do not disturb sign on the door, car parked on the next block. 
* Enjoy everything being shut down for ""Picnic day"" where the whole town becomes one big frat party. 
* Davis politics. The town likes to put on a face of being green, eco friendly, and progressive but because of the prices a huge portion of the population is old money that's extremely conservative.

"Hey!
1) The season is generally Sep ‚Äì Aug on 12-month leases. There are definitely exceptions. Consider that you can also always take over someone‚Äôs lease who‚Äôs moving out. Considering it sounds like your budget is a bit higher than the standard undergrad‚Äôs, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about competitiveness of housing here, especially during the pandemic. There are so many vacancies.
2) $1400 is pretty standard for an ‚Äúolder‚Äù apartment (i.e., hasn‚Äôt been renovated in a long time). $1800 seems a bit to high for a 1br/1br apartment imo. If you‚Äôre planning on getting around by biking, I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about the location tbh. It‚Äôs not that big of a town. Usually people don‚Äôt post until about 2 weeks to a month before the place is even available, so you might not see much if you‚Äôre looking too far into the future.
3) I‚Äôve lived in four places here with relatively few problems. In my experience, they‚Äôre all good and bad. I think if you‚Äôre nice to them, they‚Äôll be the same to you, but they won‚Äôt go above and beyond to fix anything. For example, if your sewage backs up, they‚Äôll fix it right away. If you need a screen door replaced, forget about it.

"One of the best things about Davis is that you can 100% get by without a car. My first 3 years here I lived off of my bike. If you and your roomie/partner can share a car + expenses that would likely help too. Food is slightly expensive lately but it‚Äôs due to covid and is probably expensive everywhere. If you‚Äôre a student, there‚Äôs a campus food bank that you can visit daily, no questions asked (other than if you‚Äôre a student). Utilities usually run around $100-$200 on top of rent, depending on what you need. If you‚Äôre worried about safety, try not to get a place too close to the train tracks.

I find the most difficult thing to be that every rental wants you to sign a year long lease and most are geared towards students beginning September 1st. It can really limit your options being on that schedule and many apartments fill up around this time of year with leases signed in advance.

"UC Davis has more culture than just Mondavi Center, good as it is. There are good performance spaces for music, drama, and athletics.

The art gallery scene in Sac is probably more rewarding than Davis, but both can be pretty fun to check out on Second Friday/Second Saturday, when the weather's nice.

It's a beautiful place with a ton of bike paths, pretty much every street has a bike lane so that's cool if you're into that kind of thing. For all the flaws it really is a great place to live if you can afford it, and the schools are top notch if you're a parent. I usually focus on the negatives as a reaction to these threads usually being excessively positive. To be fair, threads like these are usually in the /r/UCDavis sub, and the people answering have only been in town a couple of years. 

Being a single adult, I don't think it's worth the cost to live there, but you can base that decision off of how much you make and what you're willing to spend on housing. 

Another slight issue you should be aware of is the 12 month September lease structure most if not all rentals have. Because of the constant cycle of students, apartments will lease with a move in at the start of September and you'll have a 12 month lease. You could sublet an apartment over the summer from a student who's moving back home, or you could try to find one of the couple of apartments that doesn't follow that schedule. Just be aware, they assume you're a student that's going to stay 9 months and leave the property vacant for 3, so they'll charge you accordingly.

"I grew up in Woodland (lived there 22 yrs) and moved to Davis about 3 yrs ago. Personally I do prefer Davis because there's a lot more to do here, the greenbelt is really convenient, the public transit is better, and the people tend to be more left leaning politically. But those are the main perks. Everything else is about the same as Woodland or worse.  

I had TONS of people tell me the area of Davis I moved to is super nice & nearly crime free. But I've seen & heard of waaay more crime here in 3yrs than I did in all my time in Woodland. 

I think you're right that a lot of it is classism, people thinking poor = crime and rich = safe. Ime the cost of living is basically unlivable in both. But Woodland does seem to have more options for low income housing, mobile home parks, and cheap single room apartments. So there is a larger population of poor people there, but that doesn't inherently mean there's more crime.

Whenever I talk to people about the differences between them the people who prefer Davis will usually point out the poorest parts of Woodland and the richest parts of Davis as examples to make their case. But I live in one of the richer parts of Davis and I worry about going out at night here in a way that I never did anywhere in Woodland. 

Also someone else in this thread pointed out how anti-homeless Davis is, that's 110% true. I know Woodland & Sacramento & most cities are anti-homeless too. But Davis is so aggressively anti-homeless that most homeless people leave and the rest are pushed to stay away from places the public might see them. I'm sure even in those places they get harassed by the cops regularly though. A couple of my friends are homeless right now and refuse to live in Davis because of this. They get harassed by the cops in Sacramento plenty but it's still far more livable to them than Davis is.

Davis seems to be good at putting on a fa√ßade of being a nice town that wealthy people would want to live in. But they do so at the expense of the majority of their residents who aren't so well off. And the fa√ßade is just that, a false image that some people choose to live in and some just can't afford to.",t2_5py0yx6f,solarpunnk,0,1609216606.0,0,t1_ghd2tms,ghd2tms,True,[deleted],t3_jz8f7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/davisca/comments/jz8f7k/woodland/,Woodland,/r/davisca/comments/jz8f7k/woodland/ghd2tms/,3,r/davisca,0,3

I have never seen a more perfect description of Davis and the majority of it‚Äôs residents. I‚Äôve lived in Dixon, Davis, and Woodland, and I currently live in Woodland but work in Davis. The City of Davis generates a derangement field that causes it‚Äôs residents to think they‚Äôre better and more important than everyone else, in large part because of how humble and wonderful and good they‚Äôve decided they are. This results in Davisites overlooking so many problems with their town and culture, such as the overpriced housing, over funding of schools relative to the age of the population (money that could go to the horrifically aged infrastructure), hippo-critically pro-homeless and anti-low income, and the rampant antisemitism.

"As a Woodland resident, I had no idea how charming Woodland was until we moved here. My husband and I had been living in an apartment in Davis when we found out we had a baby on the way. I didn‚Äôt want to raise a kid in an apartment and there was no way we could afford Davis houses on a teacher‚Äôs salary so off to Woodland we went. We live in a great house in the north part of town with amazing neighbors, tons of kids playing together in the neighborhood, and we make use of all Woodland‚Äôs awesome family events and programs. The only downsides that we see about living in Woodland are the lack of greenbelts and bike paths. If we could afford to move to Davis we would, simply because access to nature and safe bike paths is really important to us. That being said, we have little problem loading up the bikes and heading out to David to enjoy them there.",t2_5d1j9,muppet_head,0,1606107817.0,0,t1_gdaxxlm,gdaxxlm,True,[deleted],t3_jz8f7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/davisca/comments/jz8f7k/woodland/,Woodland,/r/davisca/comments/jz8f7k/woodland/gdaxxlm/,3,r/davisca,0,3

"A great source for goings on and things to do is the ***Davis Dirt***: [https://thedirt.online/](https://thedirt.online/)

I've lived in Davis my whole life and somehow never new about this paper and what a great resource it is for art/food/culture in Davis (there isn't a ton lol but it's not bad here).

***DISCLAIMER - Many of these activities are NOT COVID SAFE and are either unavailable or should be avoided until the pandemic is over.***

**Arts/Music/Culture!!**

MONDAVI Performing Arts Center

SHREM Museum of Art

NATSOULAS Art Gallery (my favourite - cozy, quircky, and large for a small city) - free

PENCE Art Gallery - free

LIVE MUSIC - Davis has a lot of local bands/musicians. See local listings for schedules

ROOT OF HAPPINESS KAVA BAR - mostly college students; hippie vibe; lots of live music and nice vibe to just chill in on the comfy sofas on a cozy evening. Just a unique place.

PUB QUIZ at DeVere's Irish pub (by far the most popular and hardest trivia, but you can find trivia nights at most bars)...also really great food

FARMER'S MARKET - last on the list because though it's primarily a marketplace of local goods, it's also a social event with lots of tables and seating and entertainment venue (primarily live music but also other activities)

&#x200B;

**Food**

It's hard to list just a few locales here bc there are SOOO many good ones but my go-to (that an outsider might not know of):

Thai Nakorn, Khatmandu Kitchen,  Taqueria Guadalajara, Cafe Bernardo, Crepeville (this is reminding me that I need to familiarize myself more with the Chinese restaurants in town). Mishka's = best coffee shop in town, no contest.

Village Bakery - best bread and pizza in town

CANDY HOUSE OF DAVIS - Adorable family-owned chocolate store. Their main sell is truffles and fudge, which make a nice Christmas gift

Kim's Mart - great source of cheap Korean and other Asian groceries and snacks (there are a couple other Asian mini markets).

&#x200B;

**Outdoors and other activities**

ARBORETUM - somewhat hidden gem to outsiders (some highlights - the picturesque bridges that cross the creek, the Redwood grove, the gardens on the West end and plenty of grass/shade to picnic in)

GREENBELTS to everywhere for walking, biking, picnic-ing

Davis Memorial Union - bowling and arcade (ofc it's mainly college students and kids); I haven't been for years since it went under construction so idk what it's like now

Davis people are very active so there is good access to gyms, yoga, running/walking paths etc.

DAVIS BIKE LOOP - a good way to explore and get to know Davis.

&#x200B;

**Annual Events**

WHOLE EARTH FESTIVAL - highly recommend!!

DAVIS TURKEY TROT RACE

DAVIS PRIDE

(there are many others)

"Might be a little too late but I absolutely recommend Kelsey Fortune or Connor Gorman! They are young and intelligent and would bring strong progressive values to the city council. Here‚Äôs the endorsement I wrote for both of them: 

‚ÄúDistrict #5 is a race with two excellent candidates so we couldn‚Äôt choose just one! A vote for Kelsey or Connor will be great for the City of Davis!

Kelsey Fortune:

http://www.fortunefordavis.com/

Kelsey is a graduate student finishing up a PhD in economics. We were incredibly impressed with Kelsey and her stances on public safety/ policing, racial issues and social justice. She is committed to re-imagining public safety without a focus on law enforcement. A main part of her platform is the transformation of public safety so we know she would make this issue a top priority!

Kelsey was a clear front-runner during the YCDIE Candidate Forum! She spoke confidently and eloquently about systemic racism and the need for equity, diversity, and inclusion at all levels of our society. If we‚Äôre being frank, all her challengers (except Connor) sounded uncomfortable, awkward, or out of touch when discussing issues of race and public safety.

To top it all off, Kelsey is a fierce advocate for sexual assault survivors! For these reasons, Kelsey would be an excellent choice for Davis City Council!

Connor Gorman:

https://connorfordavis.com/

When we think of long-time, effective local activists, we think of Connor! He has been passionately involved in many local issues from strong union support and preservation of workers rights, to making City of Davis commit to divest from Wells Fargo over their involvement in the Dakota Access Pipeline, to creating true public safety through community investment and not through investment in police.

Connor is a dedicated community organizer and activist who attends almost every single City Council and committee meeting without fail (The Davis Vanguard found Connor to be the #1 commenter in Davis in all of 2018)! He has an excellent understanding of systemic racism and the intersectionality of it with every other issue; he also impressed us with his thoughtful answers at the YCDIE candidate forum!

Connor is willing to take a strong stance and will not water down his message to please others! Connor eats, sleeps, and breathes activism - even his PhD research in physics is focused on how large class size can disadvantage students‚Äô ability to learn physics. We can confidently say that Connor will always stand up for marginalized communities, and he will do so boldly!

"Breweries in Davis:

- Sudwerk (East Davis; kinda out of the way, plenty of parking) Amazing lagers and experiential beers. Tons of hops to be found in some beers, others are light and easy drinking. Oldest brewery in town (30 years) and my personal favorite from an atmosphere standpoint. Only food comes from food trucks unless you bring something, or are interested in little snack things. Dog friendly. Almost all outside; sometimes they open a back room, but otherwise standing room only inside) often have live music

- 3 Mile (Downtown; easy to get to, no parking) Another great brewery. 12 beers on tap, they do a little of everything. Usually very empty/full of small groups, so don't go expecting to meet/talk to people unless you're watching ""the game"" at the bar (whatever happens to be on). Trivia on Sunday is 6-8 and we're always there. Dog friendly. Nearby downtown restaurants deliver on foot, outside food welcome, chips and salsa for sale inside. Indoor seating and decent sized patio. Sometimes have live music

- Dunloe (just south of the train tracks ; out of the way unless you want In-And-Out, minimal parking) Best beer in town, bar none. Experimental and fun, there's always something new and flavorful to try, usually with a cool story. No TV and group tables make it a more social environment. Highly recommend. They have brewery dogs that love playing fetch; not sure the official position on outside dogs. Outside food welcome, occasional food trucks. Indoor seating with small patio. Don't think they can do live music here?

- Super Owl (West Davis; out of the way unless you're over there, plenty of parking) I've been unimpressed with every single beer I've ever had. They've won a few recent awards, and I haven't had those beers, so they might have gotten better. Beer comes in mason jars, if that sort of thing upsets you. Nearby places deliver, outside food welcome, I think they have snacks. Dogs welcome. Patio and inside seating. Never seen live music here?

- Beer Shoppe (Downton, a block from 3 Mile) Not a brewery, but 16 beers on tap plus 1000+ bottles to choose from. Usually crowded, always good. Outside food welcome, popcorn made ""fresh"" on site, no dogs, all indoors. 

- University of Beer (Downtown) 60+ beers on tap, expect to pay $1/$2 more per beer here than anywhere else. When asking questions about beers, expect to be handed an iPad rather than speak to a person. Patio seating, dogs welcome, small indoor space. I don't like this place, as you can maybe tell. 

Things to do:

- Varsity theater is a cool 50s theater that shows indie films. Worth a visit. 

- Farmer's market on Saturday is good if you want fresh veggies, fruit, baked goods, or to talk to a guy about flat Earth. 

- Arboretum is on campus, about 5k all the way around, and a lovely walk.

Food

- best pizza: village (by the train station, not the 4th and G one)

- best burger: Froggy's (2nd? and G)

- best Mexican: Taqueria Davis or Taqueria Guadalajara

- best Indian: Kathmandu Kitchen (also most expensive, get it thali style you'll thank me)

Thats really cool man.were you living in florida at the time or did your dad just take you there for the launch?i was 13 years old in the sixth grade living in davis california.my mom had sent me to utah to live with her parents.you know how some teachers growing up just made huge impressions on you and they stuck with you the rest of your like?my teacher that year was that kind of guy he actually made an impression on the whole town of davis and they post humously renamed west davis intermediate school after him.he actually wrote me letters all the way in to my mid twenties until he died of lung cancer.his name was bob willit and he made the world a better place.i wrote him back abt 1 letter to every 4 or 5 he wrote me until high school when i got caught up in all my socializing and partying.mr willit allways used to tell me i was either going to become the president of the united states when i grew up or go to prison.i have allways had lots of contradictory attributes and bob was right.obviously the likelyhood that you are talking to a current or former president is not likely which leaves the alternative.i know that my incarceration leaves little chance that i will ever go on to fulfill both sides of mr willits prophesy but i learned a great deal from it.i have come to respect the law and those empowered to enforce it and the many many things i used to take for granted i no longer do.my life just keeps getting better and better the longer i am free to pursue happiness the more i find,t2_1tocrr0n,sumwarentyme2011,0,1547804070.0,0,t1_eecc2rn,eecc2rn,False,sumwarentyme2011,t3_a9zv30,https://www.reddit.com/r/davisca/comments/a9zv30/like_many_schools_around_the_country_bob_willits/,Like many schools around the country bob willit's west davis intermediate schools 6th grade class was sitting in front of a tv with the lights off to watch a teacher be launched in to space.after the shuttle blew up we all sat in stunned silence with our teacher unsure of what to say,/r/davisca/comments/a9zv30/like_many_schools_around_the_country_bob_willits/eecc2rn/,1,r/davisca,0,1

"Really i was fist fighting everyone at school really hurting some little kids and also i had begun sneaking out whenever i could.i would meet up with a friend,between my neighborhood and my friends neighborhood we were allways able to find a car with the keys either under the floor mats,in the visor,in the door panel or even believe it or not often in the ignition.we lived in utah and 99% of the population was mormon everyone left their doors unlocked it was at the time an uncorrupted utopia.anyway i had 2 step brothers one 3 years older than me the other 5.my mom had married their dad after being introduced by her parents and a quick courtship.my mom & dad had split up in 76.in 79 my mom still stinging from my dads falling in love with another women took my biological sister and and i to utah so she could finish the degree she had abandoned at BYU when she met my dad.my mom's parents who lived in davis bought a nice 3 bedroom  condo for myself my mom and my sister in orem utah right by BYU.my mom having two kids and being in her mid 20's had a dif life than most of her classmates at BYU and longed for companionship.my grandparents in davis flew their poor heart broken daughter and her two children out to sacto every thxgiving and christmas during the allmost 4 years my mom attended BYU also my grandpa had his pilots licsense and several airplanes during his life i remember the one he owned while i lived with them in davis was a beetchcraft bonanza.so my grandparents flew out to utah a couple of times a month to look after family buissiness matters except when i lived with him he had his brother run things and make all the decisions so he could give me a break from the shitty utah step family as well as give me lots of special attention he is after all my namesake.other than my sister 2 years younger than me i was his first  and only grandchild for many years.my grandpa used to fly us in to this restaurant shopping plaza called""the nut tree"",it had its own airport and an awesome miniture locomotive that would take you from the tarmac to the restaurant.we also used to fly out to amongst other places mendicino on the coast.my grandma in particular was enamoured with the town because they filmed her favorite show on location there""murder she wrote""we would often get passes  to stand amongst the crowds while they watched episodes of the show being shot.my grandma loved good chocolate.her favorite truffle shop in mendicino made an angela landsberry truffle that cost 11$ dollars each my grandma loved them and when picking out her box's of truffles individually she allways splurged and bought 2 or 3 of the signiture truffles.so my grandparents in davis knew this nice young man from their ward in davis who was also a single parent.my grandparents flew me my mom and sister out to sacto for thxgiving 83 and it had allready been arranged for my mom to socialize and i guess go out on some dates with this guy.i guess they hit it off or they thought they did.my grandparents flew us out to sacto again for christmas to help facilitate the match they had apparently made.after we went back to utah following the christmas and new years eve holiday my mom and my future step father from davis either talked on the phone or wrote each other a letter every day.they were married that following june of 84 and my mom moved my step dad his daughter and his two sons in to our condo in utah.i know this is getting long so i am going to finish up quickly.my step dad turned out to be a violent maniac and his kids were all f-ed up too.his boys were cool calufornia kids amongst a sea of mormon hicks hellians and pot heads,my step dads younger brother used to come out from stockton to hunt on my grandpa's(now my mom's)ranch and he would allways bring a couple oz's of primo bud.so my step dad began beating the shit out of me on the daily the second day he moved in.thats why i was such a delinquent.i think my mom in her lonliness and longing for companionship combined with the fact that my grandparents had made the match just didnt think she needed to look before she lept.my grandparents thought they knew this nice young red headed bodybuilder single parent after all he was from the ward right.anyway my mom got herself in deep and i dont think she could see anyway to backtrack.my mom and my step dad fought constantly.my step dad beat my ass daily not to mention my two older step brothers took great joy in beating my cry baby mommas boy mormon ass.so after allmost 2 years of being bludgeoned and choked out my mom and my grandparents thought maybe i just needed a little extra attention that she in her desperate mind thought i was not getting because of the packed house in utah.my mom & step dad quickly had two little girls.anyway thats when i moved to davis in 85 to live with my grandparents for an indefinate amount of time.i was enrolled at west davis in bob willit's 6th grade class and i made a big impression on bob as well as my classmates at west davis.the first day in willit's class he had stacked some worksheet pages in a row and released us by row to walk down the line and put together our worksheets.there was this kid in our class i swear he must have changed his name to shaquille oneil in high school or something but at that time his name was matt johnson and he was 6""2 and a bit over 200lbs.i know he wore a size 16 shoe because after the incident im abt to tell you abt myself and matt became pretty good friends.anyway my row was released and we begin meandering our way through the line.matt's row was two behind nine but he jumped up and stepped on my boot as he aggressively cut im front of me in line.i was tough very tough i had worked summers on my grandpa's ranch plus as i mentioned i had been taking a lot of beatings from my step dad not as tall as matt but abt the same body weight of lean ripped muscle in fact i remember he was 200 lbs because he used to pound his fists on the dinner table and say shit like""what the christ is keish i need meat""anyway his ungrateful rude criticism rants abt my moms cooking at the dinner table  would allways end in""im a 200lb man"".my much older step brothers were both big kids too,by the time i moved to davis my oldest step brother was 17 6""4 and had started bodybuilding with his father.my second oldest step brother was a maniac just like his dad,he was 5""11 and the year before i moved to davis he had won state in the 172 lbs weight class.he used to come home from wrestling practice and twist me in to a pretzel allmost daily too,at 15 he had everyone in town terrified of him including his dad and his older brother he had the nastiest mesn streak of anyone i have ever met in my life or heard of he used to take a short break from beating me and beat full grown men to a pulp at a miniture golf,arcade,water slide,bumper boat place at the end of our street called trafalga.needless to say i was not scared or intimidated by matt his physical prowess and hulking body were nothing to me.to top it off in my mind at the time matt was just a *igger something i having never been around blacks or cultural diversity in sheltered utah had not learned was not ok to say or call someone.",t2_1tocrr0n,sumwarentyme2011,0,1545907974.0,0,t1_ecndfhh,ecndfhh,False,sumwarentyme2011,t3_a9mzby,https://www.reddit.com/r/davisca/comments/a9mzby/davis_legends/,Davis

"Check out my vintage base ball program. I actually started this in large part because I was having the same problem that you've written about (needed to make some friends).

It's a great time and I've met lots of great people. We're actually going to be doing an event tomorrow (SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27th) at WILLIAM LAND PARK in SACRAMENTO. Come check us out.

">leave town, join a club, join a Meetup

Sorry all these suggestions suck. 

I'm gonna assume you're unaffiliated with the University and leave out those suggestions. 

As you've discovered, Meetup is mostly running clubs, or religious/language clubs, and not quite the fun social scene. I've considered starting a new one and seeing who joins, but never gotten around to it.

I drink at a lot of breweries and I follow them on Facebook/Instagram for their events. Between 3 Mile, Sudwerk, and Woodstock's (pizza/bar, not a brewery), there's almost always live music. Other things, too. Last week was an arboretum fundraiser with plant exhibits, there's trivia every week, Thursday night football watch parties, astronomy talks, yoga, comedy, and plays.

The Farmer's market on Wednesday is almost over for the season, but it's a nice place to chill until sunset. 

If you're into rock climbing I've been told Rocknasium is a fun spot to meet people. 

Bizarro world has always struck me as your typical comic shop, where new people are met with suspicion and isn't super welcoming (but I haven't been in ages). There's also Davis Cards and Games on G St near the co-op, they used to do events like ""pay 5 dollars to try out this board game we're demoing, and if you want to buy it, your money goes towards the purchase"" thing.",t2_4vmv2,SethQ,0,1539450335.0,0,t1_e7p86ze,e7p86ze,True,suiirad,t3_9nrkny,https://www.reddit.com/r/davisca/comments/9nrkny/anyone_out_there/,Anyone out there?,/r/davisca/comments/9nrkny/anyone_out_there/e7p86ze/,1,r/davisca,0,1

"Paid parking downtown has been tossed around for, as far as I recall, a few years. The last year or so the push had been real. I don't know of anyone who supports it. 

If we're gonna do anything to improve traffic in downtown, it oughta be traffic circles instead of four way intersections South of fifth Street, and increased public transportation with a reasonable ""park and ride"" option. 

I'm not a city planner, but I'm guessing you could work out something as simple as a lot out by West Village and a single bus line from there, down the length of Russell/5th to pole line and back. Make it like $10/day for parking, but you also get unlimited rides on select bus lines for that day.

"Just **No!**. Please treat yourself better. The commute will kill you. 

I did this for about a month as I lived in Davis for many years, but was shifting to the Bay Area for my job **and the commute was horrible.**

As mentioned by others, there's a reliability /variability in the Capitol Corridor. I basically had a mental breakdown when it took me about 6 hours to return from SF on a Friday night. There's an Amtrak train to bus link At Emeryville that increases this variability. If you get off at Richmond and hop on BART is a little bit better, but about 2 dollars more. There is a community of lifers that do this commute regularly, and work on the train, but it's depressing. 

Davis is a wonderful little town, but too far from a Bay Area job.

At the rent you're listing you can find something near Lake Merritt in Oakland or nearish to BART. The AC Transit lines that go into the city are reliable the earlier in the morning, which opens up the Montclair and Park Ave area of Oakland. Not too sure if you're looking for something on that livibility scale, but Oakland or Berkeley downtown all have a great nightlife for single 20 somethings. Even SF proper as well, but living there gets stupid expensive fast.

"daviswiki.org is a great resource for finding out about housing in any of the apartment complexes in town.  There are also a lot of duplexes owned/managed by a lot of the property management companies and some private owners around town.  It's kind of hard to find these as they go fast, you just need to be patient watching craigslist and have good timing.

It is true that your money can go further in Woodland, West Sac, and some parts of Sacramento.  The trade off is commuting and campus parking is very expensive and so is gas/time.  It just matters what is important to you.  If you find a place near downtown/ the UCD med center in Sac there are mass transit options for getting to Davis that are fairly reasonable.  Some faculty, grad students, and others also live in the Bay and take CalTrain into Davis with monthly discount passes (they like that over driving since you can work on your computer during your commute).

"First, welcome to Davis!  You'll (probably) love it here!

Now, first off, a warning: Davis is expensive.  If you're willing to live in Woodland or West Sacramento, you'll find much cheaper prices, although this comes with a 20 minute commute each way.  You can choose if you want to trade convenience for affordability.

If you want to consider a house, I'd suggest looking in East Davis.  You'll find lots of families and single family homes up there.  Tends to be fairly peaceful and quiet.

North Davis/Central Davis (just north of the University) tends to be bigger, more expensive homes.

There are a couple apartment places in the downtown area, but they can be loud, small, and pricey for their location.

There are lots of apartment buildings in South Davis, but they vary widely in attitude.  Some of them are full of noisy undergrads, some are quieter, and some tend to attract low-income folks who like to meander about on the street.  

West Davis has lots of reasonably priced apartments, but lots of students live out here, and it can sometimes be noisy.  In addition, you're fairly far from the amenities of downtown.

I'd definitely take a look at reviews on the Davis Wiki for any place you're considering.  You'll find ups and downs for everywhere.",t2_cq5dj,Romanticon,0,1439406737.0,0,t1_cu0pkck,cu0pkck,True,Coldvt,t3_3gr17r,https://www.reddit.com/r/davisca/comments/3gr17r/wife_and_i_moving_to_davisca_in_november/,"Wife and I moving to Davis,CA in November",/r/davisca/comments/3gr17r/wife_and_i_moving_to_davisca_in_november/cu0pkck/,1,r/davisca,0,1
"Look in Woodland or Sacramento if you have a budget. You can get much more space for much less money. If you make good money, you may have some difficulty, because a large portion of the apartments are low income, and have an income cap. There are a handful however that are very cheap, and very nice without this restriction. 

If you don't, I can recommend:
 
Oxford Parkside - be friendly with the manager, he's a good guy, and likes to chat. If you get on his good side he'll help you out. 

Just north of down town has some older houses that are very nice and have very nice shade trees, coupled with their location, it's just wonderful. 

I believe Adobe can set you up with roommates, and the apartments are nicely compartmentalize. IIRC each room had their own bathroom, so you can avoid your roommates as much as possible. 

I can also suggest that you avoid:

Actually being in down town. 

Zabace Property management. They will try to keep your entire deposit, and seem remarkably clueless.
