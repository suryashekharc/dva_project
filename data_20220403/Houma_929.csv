**La. serial slaying suspect pleads not guilty**

&#x200B;

  
A man who police say confessed to strangling or suffocating 23 men during an eight-year killing spree pleaded not guilty Tuesday to nine counts of murder.

  
Ronald Dominique was rolled into the courtroom in a wheelchair. He mumbled “not guilty” to each count as his sister and other relatives looked on — along with family members of some of his alleged victims.

  
The nine charges of first-degree murder, which carry a possible death sentence, stem from the rape and murders of nine men between 2002 and 2005 in Terrebonne Parish, La.  


  
Dominique, 42, has confessed to 23 murders from 1997 to 2005, authorities said. Victims were found in ditches, sugar cane fields and other remote locations in southeastern Louisiana.  


  
Dominique’s public defender, Anthony Champagne, declined to comment.  


  
Among the onlookers in the courtroom Tuesday was Angela Smith, mother of victim Wayne Smith.  


  
“I wish I could have talked to him. I want to ask him ‘Before you killed my child, what were his last words?”’ Smith said after the arraignment.  


  
“I couldn’t even see him. That’s how bad a shape he was in when they sent him back to me. I just buried a box.”  


  
Dominique, who has a heart condition, was arrested at a homeless shelter in December. Initially booked on two murders, he eventually was indicted on nine and, during interrogation, confessed to 23, authorities have said.

  
Authorities have said he allegedly enticed victims with offers of money for sex, or in some cases by offering the men his “wife” and showing them a picture of a woman. Dominique is not married.  


  
In addition to the nine charges in Terrebonne, Dominique also has been arrested in connection with two bodies found in the New Orleans suburb of Jefferson Parish. However, it is uncertain when or if he will be prosecuted there because of a lack of evidence, prosecutors said.",t2_ag2bf3jz,HipHop_Local_Legends,0,1647356409.0,0,t1_i0r8oqu,i0r8oqu,True,HipHop_Local_Legends,t3_teqx17,https://www.reddit.com/r/houma/comments/teqx17/louisiana_serial_killerrapist_ronald_dominique/,"Louisiana serial killer/rapist Ronald Dominique killed over 23 people between the ages 16-46.

"Hope I get your attention while you're still in Houma. Best place to eat hands down is Cristiano Restaurant on the west side close to where Spigots it. That area also has some really great places to eat as well... 531 Liberty is a great lunch spot with daily specials, the owner worked his way from line cook to buying and running his own place, great guy, great place. There is Papi Cheo right up the street. Great place and atmosphere. You have to hit up Downtown Jeauxs by the courthouse for breakfast, trust me on this one! You want some awesome seafood, go to 1921 seafood, and then right down the street there is a hidden little old family restaurant called Abears Cafe, try their Abears catfish, you'll fall in love. Sushi, Zen off of MLK Blvd classy and great quality sushi! Let's see, Mr. Poboy is your ultimate Poboy spot, get anything on the menu... Hmmm... Classy Mexican food and atmosphere, entertainment on weekends, go to La Carretas. Pizza, West Main Pizza, you're welcome. Authentic Mexican food, Tampico on the east side. 

There are many more great restaurants. As far as things to do in Houma. Fishing, ya have to get in a boat a go catch you some red fish, speckle trout, drum fish... You can meet a stranger and they will take you fish! Lol, not even joking. I would just to show you a good time. 

Bars- Canal Bar is a great spot to chill by the water and enjoy the Louisiana scene. Mahony's is ok... There are so many bars and all, just pop in a few and see what's right for you... 

The Lakes of Houma has great recreational area with a few ponds, sports complex, fishing is allowed in the stocked ponds, beautiful location to just sit back and relax located off of hwy 311. 

Aside from that, the closest casino is located in Amelia which is 25 minutes from Houma, called the ""Amelia Bell Casino,"" worth a visit, but just know this ain't your regular casino, it is a riverboat casino. But you have all the same games and tables there as any other. 

Hope this helps, that's really all they have in Houma as far as entertainment and food. 

Best way to have a good time in Houma is to meet good quality people who live there and they will show you a good time. Down here in Houma we don't need establishments to enjoy ourselves, we just need people, music, and food. When we get together with likeminded hardworking Cajuns, we always find a way to enjoy ourselves. We bring the party wherever we go!

"Kids got a point in there, just not how he conveyed it.

Bayou Country used to be focused on being a good Catholic / Christian and taking care of your neighbor just as much as yourself.

Now a days we got people who are more dedicated to their political party than their religion or heritage. 

Pope and the Church says ""Take care of your brother and sister by getting vaccinated."" So that's what we should do.

Politics is why we wound up here in Lousiana and aren't living in France anymore. 

Never thought I'd be the guy to stand up and say ""The generation after mine isn't living right"" but it's true. 

I wonder what our ancestors would have thought about it. My parents generation didn't blink at the polio vaccination cause they saw what polio did to people.

"I am vaccinated and I live in the Houma area. My wife will not get Vaccinated, and it pisses me off because so many antivaxxers have her scared. 

The only reason I got vaccinated is for my international travel. My wife is very healthy and the only reason I want her to get vaccinated so we can go to Switzerland in December. If you want to discuss this more, I want you to know we discussed our options with our family doctor before we made our decisions. That is more responsible than doing what the Media tells you to do. 

I do have different view on the Pandemic. It should be your choice to get vaccinated or not and mask up or not, but every private company has the right to refuse your business. No one is stopping you from living your life. My daughter is has become the US National Jiujitsu Champion during COVID. We have never stopped living.

If you think California is doing so good. You should visit, I was in LA earlier this year and I was born and raised in San Diego. I would never go back. I do want out of Houma especially after the storm. If you don’t want to get out of Houma at your age, I would feel sorry for you. Houma's growth potential over the next 5 years is -1%, meaning no opportunity. 

The Pandemic is what you make it. If you decide to stop living and put your life on hold because of COVID that is your choices.

Don’t get mad because people have made choices. It is their body, so it is their choice.

There’s miles of line to Walmart and I went at 9 am before it even opened.

Houma and raceland has a cult like following of people who just gossip, eat fast food and think restaurants are personality traits, they think watching other men throw a ball is a personality trait, it’s land of the obese chicks and dudes, and worker drones.

Trust me, the houses of Homestead were built better than most houses in Houma.

"These are terraces being made to help stop erosion from wind driven waves and storm surge. They have had high success with them over near Venice, and decided to do them here, primarily in Pointe Aux Chenes.

I was a surveyor with T Baker Smith a few years ago, and we did the elevation surveys for the first set they put on the impoundment side of the PAC WMA. They're currently covered in grass and mangroves, and have really seemed to stop the erosion out there.

More are being built due south of Barry's Marina and PAC Kayak Rentals, in waters now owned by Ducks Unlimited.

The religious in Houma definitely tend to be on the side you only want to hear of on the news. I use to go to living word and I remember when they had us sign papers saying we wouldn’t bring gay people to the church. And during my childhood I remember non religious fiction books being thrown away or burned because they were things like Percy Jackson which allowed demons in the house.

"Absolutely. A lot actually. But not in a long time.

I grew up in a very religious family (Protestant). We were pretty much at church if the doors were open. Everyone around me seemed to be fervent believers but I was always questioning. Having grown up in church I did not even realize that ""Atheist"" was a thing. I thought I was the only one with doubts(this was before the internet). So, yeah, many many times I asked, weeping, for some sort of personal revelation. Nothing. Not a peep.

Ironically, I found the first atheist other than myself at my church's youth group. My first Sunday in Youth I was pulled aside by a couple of older kids who basically said ""you look like you don't want to be here as much as us"".

After I learned I wasn't alone I was fine with my non-belief and I've been much happier since.

"I grew up in a mix of Methodist and Baptist, but mostly Methodist.

I honestly don't have an answer for that. I have heard a lot of arguments from theists and I've read the Bible cover to cover at least twice(I've read parts of other holy books as well).

For me it's really the concept of faith that I don't think I could ever get past. I don't see it as a virtue but rather a form of self deception. Believing because one wants to rather than because one has a good reason for believing. And religion is all about faith based beliefs which are some time directly contradicted by historical, geographic, and biological facts.

"I can offer an anecdote.

I visited Louisiana in March of this year, the same week toilet paper became currency.  I was with my parents and brother, we're from Chicago.  After a few days in New Orleans, my mom wanted to go an an airboat ride.  We basically threw a dart at a map and wound up in Houma.  We had a delightful time, enjoyed some very good meals and, especially, an entertaining and informative boat ride.  The [Houma/Terrebonne visitors' center](https://houmatravel.com) was nice, too. We spend two nights in Houma (@La Quinta) and that's when I subbed here.  

This past summer, months after we got home, I was talking to one of my employer's customers (we do industrial controls), elsewhere in Louisiana.  I looked this customer up and saw they had a location in Houma.  I'd mentioned to him that I'd visited Houma a few months earlier and he paused, then said something like, ""You went to Houma for vacation?!?""  Yes, I sure did and I wouldn't hesitate to go back again.",t2_mgviv,DoctorBre,0,1608256521.0,0,t1_gg7g330,gg7g330,True,watch1122,t3_kfa70h,https://www.reddit.com/r/houma/comments/kfa70h/how_important_are_the_swamps_to_your_citys/,"How important are the swamps to your city’s economy?

"Bumble bff has quite a few users now I believe, might be up your alley. I'm terrible at responding but I have a ton messages I need to get to and I only reinstalled it last week. 28 f, my husband works offshore - don't have the luxury 😂 of doing the dating thing but judging from my nights out I'm sure there's pleeeeenty of eligible bachelors in town as well. 


Most of the entertainment down here revolves around drinking culture or church culture.... Can't help with the latter but there are lots of great bars in town. Most of them have already been listed here - but I also want to mention Song phi nong (great food and bar), and trivia night at the thirsty crawfish is usually pretty fun. Whenever everything reopens check them out if that's your thing. Brunch is usually popping at most places that offer it - and some of them even have live music, which is really nice. If you have Facebook most restaurants post events publicly and that's hooooonestly how I find out about what's going on in town. It's a drag but it gets the job done. 


Good luck! Welcome to Houma. Lived here 5 years on and off, not a native. Don't love it or hate it but I'm not lacking stuff to do - it's definitely what you make of it. Shoot me a dm if you have any questions.

"One of my favorite places is the Canal Bar. It’s on the intercostal. Nice place to have some drinks on the water and listen to bands. There are also a few bars on Main Street downtown. 

Work wise- what do you do usually? There are a ton of restaurants around. You also aren’t too far from Nola. Just depends what sort of work you usually do.  Take a look on indeed.com. 

You can drive out to desallmonds and take a swamp tour. Stop at Spahrs for lunch. You can tour old plantations, or take up golf if you don’t play already. There is a small mall if you like to shop. If you’re a runner, you can run across the twin bridges- there’s also a race but I’m not sure when. There is also a new planet fitness on MLK. It’s nice.

"The Thirsty Crawfish is really only great on event nights. Trivia Tuesdays are actually a lot of fun (I think they're doing karaoke tonight). The Canal Bar is a lot of fun too - especially when there's live music. Can't vouche for the downtown bars during the week - but on the weekend they're solid. 


Honestly, places that serve food usually have lots of blue collar guys around the bar during the week. Walk Ons, Song Phi Nong, Buffalo Wild Wings, The Pour House. You might be able to find a few drinking buddy's like that? The Daiquiri shops tend to be packed during the week as well since they have good specials.

"Houma is a city with a down-home feel.  Friendly locals, good food (lots of varied restaurants/chains, plus, of course, Cajun food), enough stores to satisfy shoppers, nice culture.  Best areas to live are West and North Houma.;  Eastside Houma is rough in parts and South is more rural.  Three hospitals (one contains a cancer center), and a nice-sized cardiac care facility.  Good private and public schools, depending on district.  Predominantly Catholic, but many Protestant and non-denominational churches, as well.  Weather is hot and humid in summer, pleasant in fall, mild winters, stormy springs.  Lots of festivals in autumn and spring and Mardi Gras parades, too.  Museums, little theatre, outdoor music in summer, civic center, nice main branch library, swamp tours.",t2_1b5gaqvb,noirreddit,0,1563522333.0,0,t1_eu791w0,eu791w0,True,C_Eberhard,t3_cews78,https://www.reddit.com/r/houma/comments/cews78/to_a_stranger_how_would_you_describe_houma/,"To a stranger, how would you describe Houma?",/r/houma/comments/cews78/to_a_stranger_how_would_you_describe_houma/eu791w0/,2,r/houma,0,2
"As a native Houstonian living in Houma, it reminds me a lot like Conroe. It’s roughly about the same size and there is plenty of shopping. Of course just like Conroe there are good areas and bad areas. I would in courage anyone moving here to move to the Westside. The east side reminds me of Greenspoint  area but not quite as bad maybe Channelview.
I would also say that the culture is similar enough that I feel at home here but different enough that have learned so much in the last few months I have been here.

"Moved in 2015 to Baton Rouge. Not the furthest jump but at least I’m living comfortably above sea level an in a city that seems to have a pulse and one where progress seems visible in my time spent here. 

I enjoy going back to visit but am glad to have moved on. 15 yr high school reunion was telling in how many people had in fact moved, far more than I would have guessed. Those still around were mostly there because of work, family, or continuing school.

It’s a weird relationship with the city. I fully anticipate the city to be a ghost town or gone by the time I’m my parents age or older. I miss people the most: old friends, their families, etc. it’s weird to live somewhere where you pretty much never expect and never see an old face you remember. That is for sure missed and speaks more to the small town atmosphere. I have learned that people are nice anywhere you go.

I ultimately feel I will move on from Louisiana at some point. I’m not sure when that will be, but i kinda feel like my gut knows it will happen. I’ve been all over this country and while we have a pretty little slice of it, i feel there are prettier and better slices out there.

Spigots Brew Pub on Barrow tried to start a Taco Tuesday alternative a few months ago, but I'm not sure if they kept it up. If you haven't been to Spigots, it might be worth a visit anyway. They have a pretty nice selection of damn good beer, ready to go.
