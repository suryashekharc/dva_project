"First of all, welcome!

As others have said, the market is tough right now.

Are you looking for a house only, or would you be open to renting an apartment? There are a number of apartment complexes that may have more availability… even if it’s just short term until you find a better long term solution.

If you’re moving to work for a company here, your new boss or coworkers might also be able to give you advice on where to look.",t2_igvl0,1_800_UNICORN,0,1641406349.0,0,t1_hrdubde,hrdubde,True,OddCantarzo,t3_rwp51b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smyrna/comments/rwp51b/moving_to_smyrna_ga/,Moving to Smyrna GA,/r/Smyrna/comments/rwp51b/moving_to_smyrna_ga/hrdubde/,3,r/Smyrna,0,3
"I'd like more mixed-use zoning and fewer minimum house sizes.

In the city you get neighborhoods where a house in the middle was randomly turned into a coffee shop, and it's great to be able to walk through the neighborhood and have businesses interspersed with the houses (obviously there's still zoning for eg. large industrial and manufacturing things that would be loud or require lots of shipping in the middle of the neighborhood, but being able to walk to food or coffee or a small bar or something would be great).

Similarly, in my neighborhood they added a minimum housing size so now everyone can only build giant ugly mcmansions. If that's what floats your boat that's fine, who am I to tell you otherwise, but I wish they didn't enforce that. Sure, it raises my property value which is nice, but it also ruins the character of the neighborhood.",t2_9waywif1,mellium-im,0,1641406072.0,0,t1_hrdtj74,hrdtj74,True,MaximumSea9817,t3_rb1pid,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smyrna/comments/rb1pid/if_you_could_change_one_thing/,If you could change one thing....,/r/Smyrna/comments/rb1pid/if_you_could_change_one_thing/hrdtj74/,4,r/Smyrna,0,4

">A new, more stringent air permit that would allow Cobb County’s embattled medical equipment company Sterigenics to continue operating has done little to allay the fears of residents living nearby.  
>  
>Critics of the company voiced their concerns to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division Tuesday during a public hearing the agency held on Sterigenics’ request to obtain a new air quality permit.  
>  
>Sterigenics has for decades been permitted to use ethylene oxide gas in sterilization processes for medical equipment at its plant off Atlanta Road near Smyrna. But the company has been under heavy public scrutiny since 2019 when its emissions of the gas was flagged in a federal report on elevated cancer risk.  
>  
>The gas is classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as a human carcinogen.  
>  
>The draft permit under consideration by the EPD will replace the current, less stringent one that’s now in effect, said agency spokesman Kevin Chambers.  
>  
>The draft permit would limit the annual ethylene oxide emissions to 84 pounds. Chambers said the current permit does not specify a limit, but said the company in 2017 emitted 206 pounds of ethylene oxide. The new permit would also limit the amount of ethylene oxide that can be used at the facility and requires ongoing operation and maintenance of the company’s new pollution controls, Chambers said.  
>  
>Tuesday’s meeting was scheduled for 2½ hours but was ended after one hour and about a dozen speakers. Most of the speakers criticized the company’s continued presence in a mostly residential area and its use of a carcinogenic gas they say puts their health at risk.  
>  
>Todd Smith, who lives about three miles from the plant, said he was diagnosed in June 2019 with Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. He was 43 at the time and was “in great health.”  
>  
>When a July 2019 story by WebMD and Georgia Health News cited the federal report on potential increased cancer risks for residents in neighborhoods surrounding the plant, Smith said he wondered if ethylene oxide had contributed to his illness. His questions about the cause of his cancer have compelled him to oppose any new permits for Sterigenics to operate in the area.  
>  
>“We know that there’s a silent assassin that’s sleeping in our tent,” he said of ethylene oxide.  
>  
>Daryl Mosby, who has served as general manager of the plant since 2010, said Sterigenics’ Cobb plant and others around the country sterilize more than 20 billion medical products annually — about half of the products that require sterilization in the U.S. The list includes IV tubes, surgical kits, cardiac catheters, gowns and gloves each year. For many of those devices, Mosby said using ethylene oxide for sterilization is the only method that meets U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines.  
>  
>Mosby also said third-party testing under EPD’s supervision show the company’s “emissions controls perform significantly better than total ethylene oxide removal requirements established by the EPD.”  
>  
>“The bottom line is that we are operating the most advanced emissions controls at any sterilization facility anywhere in the world,” he said. “Our facility is safe for those of us who work here and for the surrounding community.”  
>  
>Some residents are worried that the EPD does not have enough oversight to regulate ethylene oxide and Sterigenics’ operations. Bridget Kurt, who lives about a mile from the plant, said the agency has not imposed any regulations on the transportation of ethylene oxide by trucks.  
>  
>“This is a very dangerous chemical, it’s highly explosive and it does not belong near my neighborhood and that’s the bottom line,” she said.  
>  
>Janet Rau, who lives in Smyrna, added the state should not allow Sterigenics to self-report its ethylene oxide emissions. Instead, the state agency should install its own equipment outside the plant to collect data independently.  
>

>The plant suspended operations last year to install new pollution controls following public criticism over its ethylene oxide emissions.

>Later, the county kept the facility closed, citing the plant being out of compliance with fire code.

>Sterigenics then filed a lawsuit against the county on the basis that Cobb didn’t have the authority to keep the plant closed. In April, a consent order was approved to allow the company to resume full operations while its lawsuit against county proceeds through the court system.

>Chambers told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that no timeline has been given on when a decision will be made on the permit.

"My political tendencies a incredibly clear if you review my post history, but that's not what this is about.

Every US Citizen has what are known as Civic Duties. These are responsibilities we have as citizen of the United States.

* A responsibility to take the time to inform ourselves of what's going on
* A responsibility to make informed decisions to help shape this country
* A responsibility to hold every single elected official accountable for their role and what they have said
* Responsibility to help our community, our state, and our nation strive ever for a more perfect union

Every single one of us wants what is best for this country, it's just that many of us have differences of opinion not only about how to achieve that, but about what it even means.

Inform yourself. Register to Vote. Contact your elected representatives if you have questions or concerns. Expose yourself to a wide range of news sources. Remain Calm. Speak CALMLY to your friends and family about your opinions.

DO NOT just wait for your turn to talk AT them. LISTEN TO THEM AT LEAST AS MUCH AS YOU TRY TO TALK. DO NOT INTERRUPT.

ALWAYS retain the idea that you can be WRONG and might need to change your position when presented with new information.

"Voted this morning at the community center. Got there extremely early (about 5:45 am) so was 4th in line.  About 50 people in line when the polls opened at 7am. Still, things moved briskly. Whole process took about 15-20 minutes once you're inside (though they have additional lines to wait in once inside the center).  Plenty of parking around the community center, and at least in the early AM just about limitless overflow parking at the shops around the Village Green.

Some tips: Yes, bring a pen, although they will provide one if you forget.  Read the instructions carefully: You only have to complete the highlighted portions of the advanced voting form, but some are tricky (one blank says birth year, another wants your birthdate, for example).  After you vote, you will get a hard copy of your ballot selections. REVIEW it.  Do not fold it or discard it. No one tells you this, but you get to keep this receipt for about 15 seconds. You're next stop is a shredder that SCANS THE QR CODE on your receipt to verify that you dropped off your hard copy receipt (your vote may not be counted if you don't return this), and it then gets fed into a shredder.",t2_av3mj,hooptiedreams,0,1603162219.0,0,t1_g9eaocg,g9eaocg,True,durwoodg,t3_jdsxma,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smyrna/comments/jdsxma/voting_plans_and_experiences_lets_help_each_other/,Voting Plans and Experiences?

"Hey! I’m happy to answer any and all questions. If you have more I can send you my number and we can call.

1. My roommate got some roach spray and we spray once every other week or so. It was $10 at Walmart and I really doubt they care that we do it. They’re really lax about what you do here.

2. There are, but there is always visitor parking and I doubt anything would happen to you if you covered your car. There’s been a motorcycle parked outside my place the entire time I’ve been here and they don’t have a parking sticker.

3. We use Xfinity’s gigabyte internet, I don’t know anything about Google Fiber unfortunately. 

4. Since we live in a townhome and have the room for a separate washer and drier, we bought some on FB marketplace and installed them ourselves. Took maybe an hour and we only spent a little less than $200.

We really like it here and don’t regret our choice at all.

"The Zagster shares are sitting in limbo. Another company acquired the assests but is basically going around in circles trying to negotiate a new plan before removing them as removal and then subsequent re-installation would be pretty expensive. The best thing anyone can do is contact the city and let them know you want bike shares to come back.

I live in Smyrna and it's a great city for cycling and is a very good city for bike shares. They have a comprehensive sidepath system that connects the city with residential and commercial areas. There are 4 easy ways to get to the silver comet, can ride to and through Marietta almost entirely on bikepaths, can ride to and past the battery on paths, there are good low-traffic side roads that connect as the city was laid out and developed before cul-de-sac development took over. The only metro area that really compares is Dunwoody, but Smyrna has a lot less traffic and a better layout, in my experience.

Anyway, if you don't have a bike there are some listings on spinlister and the silver comet bike shop, comet trails, does rentals off floyd road.",t2_5ftfm1qc,spoonrobot,0,1598108336.0,0,t1_g2h6pw0,g2h6pw0,True,ShizzoMode,t3_iea2b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smyrna/comments/iea2b4/smyrna_bike_share_question/,Smyrna Bike Share Question,/r/Smyrna/comments/iea2b4/smyrna_bike_share_question/g2h6pw0/,2,r/Smyrna,0,2

"Hi - I totally share your sentiment wanting to do more. I started reading some information related to diversity in Smyrna and Cobb County and it seems like there is room for more actions to be taken. As a non-black person who is not a police, I would really love to find a way to learn and understand from both perspectives. 

Maybe as Smyrna residents,we can start locally and figure out if we can make our town/county more perfect. Please feel free to PM me if you have any ideas. Thanks.

"I lived in a 1bed1bath in the area of Smyrna you’re looking at so I think I can help a little.

Most of the newer apartments like mine would charge water usage per building and then split the cost per unit. I usually paid an extra $15-30 that was added to monthly rent charges.

Trash: about $15 added to rent charges
Cable: WiFi/cable with most companies in the area $100 
Electric: $50-$70 (but I like my place cold)

Before you settle on a place and sign they should give you a print out with what’s included in rent and estimated extra charges per month. If not you can request one and say you need it for employment reimbursement. 

If you choose a newer place there will be added fee’s you’re not expecting ie: pest control, common areas, upkeep, etc. But some of the older ones will charge for these things as well

County Officials Monitoring Concerns Over Smyrna Plant (UPDATED) | Cobb County Georgia

Issues with Sterigenics in Illinois:

Sterigenics hid early warning signs and toxic emissions from public

https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-met-sterigenics-early-warning-hidden-from-public-20181025-story.html

https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2019/02/03/sterigenics-covered-up-toxic-emissions-operated-secret-plants/amp/

Sterigenics promised emission reducing equipment would help, but at times pollution was higher after equipment was installed 

""What’s just as alarming is that they’re even higher than emission levels detected before Sterigenics installed pollution control equipment last summer to take care of the problem. Let’s repeat that: Sterigenics installed equipment to minimize the pollution, and afterward, pollution levels at times were worse.""

https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-sterigenics-epa-air-pollution-cancer-20190214-story.html

Reopening of Sterigenics plant criticized 
https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/7/18/20699603/sterigenics-willowbrook-reopen-agreement-criticized

There are several articles that discuss where the problem emissions are coming from in Illinois. It's off-gassing from pallets of products that escape unfettered from cargo doors. 

See this article towards the end when they talk about off-gasing. It's not the stacks that are the problem for emissions. It is literally the cargo bays that are not regulated. So Sterigenics' promise to install emissions reduction equipment is empty.

Update from 7/24 meeting: Margie Donnell from Stop Sterigenics spoke to a packed house about Sterigenics in Georgia. Margie was impressed by the turnout and remains optimistic we can mobilize and shut down Sterigenics in Georgia like her organization did in Illinois.

"This ignores the entire psychological side of economics. People like familiarity. Change is uncomfortable. Tasting new foods is great when that's the goal, but for picking up dinner on the way home, most people have a half dozen options that they always choose from despite living in a city of 1000's of options. Tell me specialization isn't necessary in the food business when roughly 1/3rd of all restaurants in the US are chains, meaning that they literally have the exact same menu in many locations. Chains are incredibly successful because they're familiar, and familiarity feels safe.   


So sure, on paper yeah, this would be really ideal for saving space and increasing options. But unless you're going to have the local government ban free-market business and open food halls, which would promptly have everyone moving away, there's not much you can do about it other than more insightful city planning.   


And to put a little more perspective into the power of consistency, one of the ways we psychologically torture terrorism detainees at Gitmo is by changing their meal times and never serving them the same meal twice.

"I'm eighteen, also nerdy hipster type, I've lived in Smyrna my entire life. I'll answer what I can!

2. Suntrust park only really effects the area *directly* around it in terms of traffic. Even if you do need to drive through the area on a game night, it's really not too bad. Might add a few minutes to your trip, but it's not like Atlanta where you want to tear your hair out.

3. Campbell High is the high school that pretty much everybody in Smyrna goes to. I graduated from Campbell and had a pretty good experience. It's a decent public school, you'll probably have a better time if you work with honors/AP/IB kids because they're too focused on their work to cause trouble. There are also a lot of private schools around that you could look into.

4. Smyrna is extremely dog friendly! There are a ton of restaurants with outdoor seating and they pretty much all allow dogs. Wade's on Spring Rd. is a really great one. It seems like pretty much everyone in Smyrna owns a dog. There are a few nice dog parks in the area and I haven't had any bad encounters there. Pretty recently a big shepherd got a little too aggressive with my small dog, and the owner immediately helped me separate them and left the park with his dog which I really appreciated.

8. I'm a super homebody, so I don't do too many social events, but there's pretty much always something going on in Smyrna. Local bars do things live trivia night, the Village Green has events going on all the time, it's super easy to find something to do.

9. Traffic really isn't too bad. It's nothing like Atlanta traffic. During rush hour it will definitely take you a little longer to get around on the busier roads, but nothing insane.

  
Marietta and Mableton are also pretty nice areas nearby that you might want to look into. I moved to Mableton when I moved out of my parents' house and that's where I live currently. It's not as nice as Smyrna but it's *way* cheaper and only a few minutes away.

One thing I didn't mention.  I love Smyrna.  It is a city that is evolving as younger people move here.  I have seen a lot of changes in the past 2-3 years for the better.

"I fit this pretty closely.  I have lived in Smyrna for over two years now (having rented downtown Atlanta prior).

1. Smyrna/Marietta actually has some fantastic restaurants.  Some of my favorites include (no particular order)
2. Muss and Turners
3. Taco T
4. Two Birds (technically in Marietta but it is like 10-15 min drive away)
5. El Felix (this is at the Battery where the Braves play)
6. WR Social House (Marietta)
7. Minato
8. Da Vincis Pizza
9. Mezza Luna
10. Siam Square
11. Porch Light
12. (let me know if you want other suggestions. the point is, there is really good food in Smyrna)

1a. So i am a huge craft beer drinker myself.  There are a few good places to get craft beer.  Here are my favorites near/in Smyrna

1. Stout Brothers
2. Muss and Turner has a speak easy called Elanors which is cool.
3. Wades (it is a restaurant which has a decent bar and I personally dont care for their food)
4. The Battery has a TON of places to drink including Garden and Gun Club which is a gem of a place
5. There are breweries near smyrna but none in smyrna.  check /r/atlbeer for that.  There are a ton of breweries which i would be happy to suggest.

2.  I love the braves and go to a ton of their games.  There is no difference really game day vs non gameday.  It is super organized and the stadium is right by the interstate. Smyrna is not really affected by it as it stays pretty contained to the battery.  

3. Truth be told, the HS here are a mixed bag.  Campbell HS gets decent enough ratings.  Young families move to Smyrna particularly to be zoned for King Springs.  It is one of the best elementary schools in the Atlanta area.  I assume that would be a great place to work due to its very high ratings.  I dont know much about the schools though.

4. There are a ton of parks in Smyrna and also greak hiking not far (Sweetwater and Kennesaw Mountain are short drives away).  Silver Comet trail is THE place where people go to walk their dogs/run/cycle/etc.  It is awesome and in Smyrna.

5. Internet is actually decent.  Most have Comcast, Charter, and AT&T.  I personally have AT&T Fiber which has been amazing.

6. Cost of living is not too bad.  That will very much depend on where you are coming from.  I personally find the utilities dirt cheap.

7. Housing.  So, Smyrna is the fastest growing atlanta suburb and housing prices have increased quite a bit in the past few years.  Housing in the ""King Springs zone"" sell very quickly and cost more.  There are quite a few larger complexes to rent but i dont know much about it. Check out SYNC at Jonquil, and the ones at the battery.  No clue how much they cost but they are very new and seem nice.

8. People go to the battery, go in the city, or go to Marietta.  I deem Marietta the OTP version of Decatur Square.  There is so much to do and events going on all the time.

9.  Traffic is nonexistent compared to Atlanta.  Things get a little congested around 4-7, but nothing like in the actual city.  I dont really notice traffic being a big deal.

"**Smyrna Market Village**

Great spot. Lot of restaurants, coffee, ice cream, plus a great growler shop called Stout Brothers. They also just made the village open container, so you can grab a beer from any of the spots and walk around with a beer. 


**The Battery**

Kind of obvious, but this is an awesome place to check out. Games are starting tomorrow, it's fun to go to a game, fun to go on game day but not go in, and it's also fun to just go when it's not game day if you don't prefer a crowd. 


**Restaurants/Food Related**

* Gotta check out Porch Light. Make a reservation, it gets busy
* Bellas and Davinci's are our favorite pizza spots.
* Mezza Luna has great pasta/seafood.
* Wade's is a new sandwich spot that just opened that's pretty solid
* Tuesday food trucks at Taylor-Brawner is awesome. Should start in may.
* The Village also has some great events.

I second the Battery, it's a nice place to spend a couple hours and parking is free in the Red deck on non-game days. Also, there's generally a lot to do in that area. Cumberland mall itself is mediocre but there's plenty of shopping and restaurants around there.

"I cannot really comment on that as I do not have the comparative crime statistics for mass transit stations available to me. I prefer to focus on the things we do know:

1. Metro Atl traffic is terrible and will only get worse without another form of transit available. 
2. We can only build/widen so many roads before the city is one giant highway. 
3. Road maintenance is expensive and again only will get worse the more roads we build and more cars we add. 
4. Mass transit rail will attract more job growth to our area (I.E. Dunwoody with State Farm) as corporate leaders have indicated this is a reason they may look to relocate as it makes it tough to attract talent when they have traffic that makes for a poor quality of life. 
5. To remain regionally competitive we must have commuter rail in Cumberland. It is the only city center in Atl that does not have this. (If you think Mass Transit will bring crime, just wait till these large corporate centers with all their jobs leave for a place that has rail access)
