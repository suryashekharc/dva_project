"Would you use it!?

Hey Santa Barbaral! My name is Noor and I'm the founder of Respayc. This is not a promotional post, I'm looking to understand if this would be of benefit to community members. I was directed to the commerce thread as the best place to post this. üôÇ

I'm getting ready to launch a community based app. Myself and the business are based here in California so naturally I want to hear from you! I'm looking to get any feedback you all might have surrounding the below question.

 ""Would you use it?"" 

Respayc is the community-powered shared spaces platform. We provide an opportunity that enables hosts to share their spaces with guests looking for a particular space. The spaces available can range from a home gym, office, and pool space to an event room, photo studio and so much more. Community driven and community backed!

I'd like to hear any and every thought you have. Check out the concept at the below links and provide your feedback in the comments or DM. üôÇ

"So if a big reason they are homeless is because they aren‚Äôt from the area then why are you recommending people that aren‚Äôt wealthy to move here? I‚Äôm just trying to be realistic. If you actually lived here that whole time you would have noticed how fast the rent has gone up as well as the cost to buy. Right now, you can‚Äôt even get a condo for less than 700k. Also, just because your coworkers can barely make ends meet on less than that does not prove my point wrong. If anything it shows that you can‚Äôt really have an enjoyable life here on that. Life isn‚Äôt good when you can barely pay the bills and 1 unforeseen emergency can put you under. It doesn‚Äôt matter where you live at that point.

And how many people make significantly less and make it on that? Last I checked, thousands of people have to commute in every day because they can‚Äôt afford it.

Edit: I was actually pretty curious so I found this, why don‚Äôt you take a look?

On the other hand, my grandparents' generation (born in the 1890s) were having families around this time, and had themselves probably grown up eating unprocessed foods. I guess what I'm driving at is that we Boomers (speaking for myself, not assuming you're a Boomer) may have been the first US generation to grow up on lots of processed foods (speaking in very broad generalities), with the digestive issues that can come from that.

"I don't know. The first comments on this thread didn't realise it was a joke. I had to tell them it was a troll post. So I think the guy did an okay job of fooling people.  I think it just hit a little too close to home and there is a lot of resentment towards HENRY's these days.

Sadly the government allowing the commoditisation of assets over the last 20 years has diminished quality of life for all income levels. Predictable, but no one cared while people were scooping up 50 homes and middle income earners were being left in the dust. The flipping thing needed to be shut down long long ago. So did hedge funds piling into sfh. It's pissed a lot of people of and the joke that is negative interest rates isn't funny anymore. So sadly, people can't find humour in this post.

- 200 (credit card)

- 1000 rent
- 75 mobile phone
- 150 utilities shared with roommates
- 100 gas
- 75 subscriptions/streaming

- laundry
- toiletries

Perhaps look at your budget after taking out these things first: 

- taxes
- student loan payments
- other debt (like car, credit card)
- health insurance and expenses 
- car insurance

After that how much do you have left? That covers rent, food, utilities, gas, laundry, supplies, fun/travel/clothes.

Then look at Craigslist ads for roommates. A single room may be $800-1200 plus utilities. Or you could share a room.

"I think if you like to live frugally you could make it work with sacrifices.

In general, I would say ""No"". Without knowing your financial situation, I'd say $3200 a month is not a good solo-salary situation for SB given that...
* housing availability isn't keeping pace with demand (probably way more than 30% of your pay would go to rent)
* cost of goods/services is higher and inflation is crazy (depends on a lot of personal factors, of course)

It sounds like you'd be in the situation I was in 2018. I was living in SB as a single guy and was interested in staying in SB. I crunched my numbers and couldn't justify it. I was able to move away, make money, and then just moved back recently with a better financial situation.

"Exactly. And having roommates/housemates actually helps with getting out there and expanding your social circle. Having your own place is cool and all but it gets lonely honestly (personal opinion). Your only struggle would be to find accommodation. It‚Äôs cut throat right now - every place you find on Craigslist there‚Äôs at least 100 applications for that same place you want. 

A tip: landlords like, and will favor people in the real estate industry to be their tenant. Before I actually started working in property management, I told the landlord of every place I applied for over the years that I was a property manager. They eat that shit up, they love it. Because they know you‚Äôll take care of the place and won‚Äôt trash it like 90% of these other college students. So honestly add it in to your application, just say you manage properties on the side for some family friends, or something along the lines. It‚Äôll definitely bump your application up to the top.

"Since you lived here before you know Goleta and downtown are a car ride away (not walking distance) so that should be taken into consideration. I‚Äôm guessing your job is in Goleta though from the post!
There‚Äôs plenty of options for food and activities and beach/hikes in Goleta but it‚Äôs a different vibe than downtown. It‚Äôs *usually* cheaper to rent a spot whether sharing or studio in Goleta, downtown is definitely more expensive.
Yes housing is super competitive and you‚Äôll have to spend the time looking and contacting and making yourself appear as the perfect tenant. 
But I actually make it work living here on around $24k a year.

"Don‚Äôt know if this will help, but I‚Äôve been living in SB for 6 years and can give you some of my expenses for last year. I moved out of state the beginning of this year but I digress.

Income: $42k (pre-tax)
Rent: $1,100 p/month (after utilities)
Car + insurance: ~$600 p/month
Living situation: master bedroom with bathroom and 2 housemates on De La Vina close to Cottage hospital (5 minutes from downtown SB).

These were my non-negotiable expenses. My other biggest expense was eating out with friends BY FAR. I couldn‚Äôt put an amount to it but for reference sake, we‚Äôd eat out at least 5 times a week. Some days twice. And of course restaurant bills ain‚Äôt cheap. I would probably spend around 50 a month on clothes.

The thing is‚Ä¶ if you want to live the Californian lifestyle and enjoy every moment and do all the things there is to do, go out and about every day of the week, go to dinner with friends multiple days of the week, go on trips with your friends once a month to nearby towns (San Diego, LA, Mammoth, etc.), go to music festivals, and just generally be a socialite - you absolutely can on a 58k salary. I did it on a 42k salary.

HOWEVER, that being said, it is after all what they call a Californian lifestyle because you‚Äôre living paycheck to paycheck and you forego saving each month for an INCREDIBLE social life.

If I‚Äôm honest, I miss SB everyday since I‚Äôve moved and have made one of my goals in life to return once I am financially free. It truly is a magnificent place and I wouldn‚Äôt think twice about moving back (hence why so many influential individuals have homes there).

So to conclude. Don‚Äôt go to Bakersfield bro‚Ä¶ trust me the memories you‚Äôll make and the bonds you‚Äôll create in SB will be lifelong. You can absolutely afford it.

"Sure, from the mean high tide line out to towards the ocean is public land for the entire length of California‚Äôs coast. I love our beaches and public lands and everything they stand for.

However, that doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôs the responsibility of the landowners who‚Äôs property touches or even blocks access to these beaches to provide access for the public. Most of California‚Äôs coast is rugged and some of the best parts take a bit of work to get to. 

The best example I‚Äôve seen in for this argument is: just because I‚Äôm driving through Big Sur and catch a glimpse of a beautiful beach down at the bottom of some cliffs‚Ä¶ Doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the landowner‚Äôs job to build a path or staircase or provide me with any access really through his land to get to that beach, even though it may be public property.

I‚Äôm going to be honest - your age is going to hinder you from a lot of room shares. Many people who are renting in this town are younger 20/30 year old working professionals who don‚Äôt want to live with people much older or way younger housemates. The easiest way is to try and find someone other people around your age to rent an apartment instead of finding a room. I‚Äôve seen some mid 40s and mid 50s people post rooms for rent or even families so there might be hope there. But there‚Äôs a housing crisis going on due to Covid WFH and the local university.

"Your job requires total hypocrisy.  the manager opposes tenant protection because of worry it'll raise rents?  huh.   You are just very soft-hearted ...no that's not the reason.  you're just a greedy hypocrite, there are millions just like you.

I just read that hog farmers are challenging a new law that says in calif, a pig will have to have enough room to turn around.  the farmers are very upset, they say the pigs don‚Äôt want the extra room.

The chicken farmers said the same thing.  we needed a ballot initiative to get chickens enough room to turn around, and the right not to literally live in their own s##%.  

The chicken farmers told us it would be a disaster if chickens could turn around.  they'd get all sad, maybe start smoking dope, plus the price of chickens would skyrocket.   

the purpose of the repub party is to maintain and increase the concentration of wealth obviously.   Since that doesn't sound super appealing to most people, they have to lie every time they open their mouths.

I literally draw the line at the threshold of own home and do not allow repubs in.   
I can't handle the stench of their hypocrisy, laced with fascism and racism nowadays.   

I wonder if they will ban me for calling out the greedy hypocrites.   I'm sure they won't ban these snaky folks themselves.

"I understand the point you made. My point of disagreement is different and I did a piss poor job of differentiating! I agree rent control is more bad than it is good. Just allowing rent controls off CPI increases like the apartment I rented in Berkeley is why that cities stock of rentals is in bad shape or was at least and why landlords were scummy to get you out after a year. The harm in unlimited increases is bad for society though. If my rent goes up 50% (happened to me once) I have to move and find another place in a market that is likely more expensive. In other words balance is important. 

The point that you made that I‚Äôm sort of disagreeing with is that rent control would be contributing to lack of investment and development. To me, if you tell a landowner that they can‚Äôt raise the rent to market on their property unless they redevelop it in a way that increases density then the landowner would be incentivized to increase the density of the property and redevelop(at least theoretically). 

I will also say that if the potential market rate of a rental goes up then the value of that land also goes up. My family just redeveloped a SFH to a 6 unit apartment building and building costs are no joke and some of the regulations are truly overkill. It‚Äôs easier for an existing landowner to make something like that pencil out than a developer. If you don‚Äôt tie value increases for investors into redevelopment then they‚Äôre typically happy seeing their property value go up without going through the hassle of redeveloping it in ways that meet housing needs in the area.

*Edited out some mistakes I made explaining. I‚Äôm better at talking these things out.

"I disagree with your point of disagreement :-).  Rent control helps limit the supply of rental housing because developers will build for purchase housing over rental.  Limited supply increases prices of any existing rental housing.  The way to make the value of rental housing go down is to increase supply (i.e. build more apartments).

I think this is the best summary source on the economics of rent control: [https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentControl.html?fbclid=IwAR0Yo3XE88GX3DONs7rmdN1EvmzG4zpSRPtLLqanghqJsMG25bu0uJYiHeQ](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentControl.html?fbclid=IwAR0Yo3XE88GX3DONs7rmdN1EvmzG4zpSRPtLLqanghqJsMG25bu0uJYiHeQ)

I am not a landlord so don't have any skin in this game.  In my opinion, most reputable economists agree that rent controls harm renters as a whole.  Sure, some individual renters benefit if they happen to move into a desirable place a long time ago, but that cost is transferred to new renters (usually young people).  Republicans don't listen to experts on climate (which frustrates me greatly) and Democrats don't listen to experts on economics (which frustrates me greatly).  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø",t2_7q6t2,kyle32,0,1648674734.0,0,t1_i2rl0xm,i2rl0xm,False,someguy564,t3_tkddlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tkddlx/how_to_skirt_the_ab1482_tenant_protection_law/,How to skirt the AB1482 Tenant Protection law,/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tkddlx/how_to_skirt_the_ab1482_tenant_protection_law/i2rl0xm/,1,r/SantaBarbara,0,1

"I don't think any hotel INSIDE Santa Barbara is particularly better than another. The Kimpton is nice but not particularly romantic or cheap. I would say the same of every other hotel I've stayed at here. They're nice but romantic or cheap aren't what I would call them.

While expensive, not close, and kitschy (if that's how you spell that) the Madonna Inn is what I would call romantic. It's a little under 2 hours north, has some of the best steak in the area at their steakhouse (SPLIT the fillet mignon and aim for some midnight snack leftovers) which is done up in pink with golden cupids. The rooms are individually themed, so each one is different. If you get a lower level one with lots of rock in the decoration, no one will hear you. Though I never heard anyone up in the Love Nest room either, which has a tower you can go up and try to spot deer wandering over the property at night. The hotel is an EXPERIENCE. It's just that it is so in all ways including price and distance.

There is also Apple Tree Farm in much the same location. Not quite as pricey, not as kitschy, not as wildly individualistic, not as thick walled, food is more like a diner, rooms are still more romantic than any place I've stayed in Santa Barbara. 

But if you concentrate very hard on ignoring the neighbors (if people get loud they will hear each other), ignore the idea of romantic food at the hotel, and still pay too much, you can get a great sunset looking out over the water at the Hilton Santa Barbara Beach Front Resort. Make sure to get a room on the bottom floor with a patio by the road, the view is what makes it worth the money and gives it what romantic vibe there is.

>This Tuesday, the Santa Barbara City Council will review its water supply portfolio. The early indications are somewhat reassuring: If California is on the deck of the Titanic, at least Santa Barbara is in a very nice deck chair. In part, that‚Äôs because city water planners have been preparing for the worst by allowing groundwater basins to recharge over the past three years with water from the city‚Äôs desalination plant.

"**[Hotel California](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_California)** 
 
 >""Hotel California"" is the title track from the Eagles' album of the same name and was released as a single in February 1977. Writing credits for the song are shared by Don Felder (music), Don Henley, and Glenn Frey (lyrics). Joe Walsh came up with the dual-guitar descending arpeggio part that ends the song: he did not, however, get writing credits. The Eagles' original recording of the song features Henley singing the lead vocals, and concludes with an electric guitar solo performed by both Walsh and Felder, in which they both take turns of playing lead before harmonising and playing the aforementioned arpeggio towards the fade out at the end.

"It does not just apply to rent control. Anything that makes it more expensive to provide the rental, including anything that opens the landlord up to financial risk will cost the landlord.  They will need to choose to (1) loose money, (2) raise the rent or (3) stop providing the rental.  Not many will choose to loose money.

Any ""tenant right"" creates the potential for the landlord to be compelled to act or restricted from acting (or exposes them to legal ramifications if they disobey).  This makes it more expensive for them to provide the rental.

This being said, from what the linked article says, the burden seems to be fairly small (is there more to it? Mandatory mold and stove inspections?), so I would not expect too much impact.

"Yea,  it's shitty all the  way  around.  I'm a landlord,  keeping properties habitable isn't difficult,  but can  be  occasionally expenses in bursts.

The black mold issue troubles me.  Stachybotrys is a black slimy mold that grows in your shower if the bathroom isn't well ventilated.   As  a youth  growing up in the  1970's San  Fernando Valley,  my first dumpy rental home was shared by 4 20+ years olds.  The lone shower always had black slimy mold until one of us got  fed  up and scrubbed it away with  Comet‚Ñ¢.   It would  be  back  in  a month.

Then  in  the 90's it  was discovered  that black mold created  micro toxins, minuscule amounts of compounds that could be toxic in large amounts.  This  touched off a firestorm  in the insurance industry,  and  black mold exclusions and related policy  endorsements went wild.

Black mold created  a  'mold remediation' industry that  has preyed on the fear instilled in landlords.  Stachybotrys spores are everywhere in  the atmosphere.  If you  have a minor leak around a window,  and moisture gets inside a wall,  Stachybotrys will grow inside that wall.  Stachybotrys requires  a lot  of moisture to  survive.

If a heavy rainstorm get's water inside the wall,  and it's sunny  and hot  the  next week,  you'll have Stachybotrys spores that spring  to life as active mold,  and as it  dies from lack of moisture it will generate more spores.  A mold test  of the air  inside  that wall will show  elevated  Stachybotrys spore counts  (spores are  not active  mold).

Stachybotrys spores contained inside a sealed wall are not a danger and do not need to be removed.

Visible black mold is evidence of water intrusion,  fix  the water intrusion issue and the black mold issue  will go away  after simple cleaning.

If you  hire a mold remediation company,  the most  important thing they do is using a moisture meter  to  search for moisture.  They will also insist on a 'wall sample'.   If  they find moisture in your rental, find the source, fix it then clean up any black mold that resulted.

If all the remediation company finds is Stachybotrys in a wall sample,  ignore it.

If  mom and pop landlords are required to verify absence of black mold,  a lot of them may fall victim to the mold remediation industry.",t2_ovkpy,theFoot58,0,1648514106.0,0,t1_i2i7vk6,i2i7vk6,False,hcbaron,t3_tqlzi8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tqlzi8/this_iv_property_manager_thinks_that_more_tenant/,"This IV property manager thinks that more tenant protection ordinances will drive housing ""prices higher and/or removes units from the rental market.""",/r/SantaBarbara/comments/tqlzi8/this_iv_property_manager_thinks_that_more_tenant/i2i7vk6/,9,r/SantaBarbara,0,9

"The easiest way is if the inmate is a ""trustee""/""workaid"" - an inmate trusted with more freedom to move about the facility, less supervision, and/or acces to more dangerous materials (bleach, knives if working in the kitchen) in order to get the work done inside the jail - and running at the opportune time.  However, with the charges he is facing and the amount of his bond, I would suspect that he wouldn't be granted that privilege; though, I don't know the policies of the jails in Santa Barbara County.  The other way is the old-fashioned way, like they show in the movies - slowly chiseling out blocks, breaking through windows and/or metal bars, having someone sneak in street clothes and changing into them at the right moment in order to walk out the front door if security isn't paying enough attention.

"Reagan got the ball rolling. The ACLU has repeatedly upheld the rights of the homeless and intractably mentally ill to live on the street, in filth, and to refuse all help until they freeze, rot, or starve to death. The ACLU has made it impossible to Baker Act anyone, or to hold anyone in a hospital for more than 72 hours without meeting nearly impossible hurdles. I realize it's fashionable to hate Reagan, and he was certainly to blame for a lot, but you must realize and educate yourself that the families and loved ones of the severely addicted and mentally ill have NO ABILITY to help, hold, or restrain their loved ones from the streets. If you are a psychotic schizophrenic or an intractable heroin addict and you want to live among rats and feces on the streets, the ACLU has made it 1000% okay to do so, with no pushback from anyone, until you die or get arrested and enter the revolving door of jail for stupid fines and infractions.

Many homeless people, particularly the most vulnerable, are raped, beaten, and worse on a regular basis, but still refuse treatment, or medication. This is not for lack of resources or effort.

"I agree that it is terrible, and there are numerous issues. Fairview is the red-headed step child of traffic planning in the Santa Barbara area...

One of the easier to fix problems is that anyone headed West on Calle Real gets stuck at the light because the right lane is the one that you are supposed to use to go straight. This is just dumb, both lanes should allow you to go straight, or better yet, the right lane should be right turn only. I don't usually go this way, but I always feel bad for anyone stuck behind me that wants to turn right, and head toward the mountains on Fairview. Again, anyone familiar with this stupid intersection has to cut through the gas station on that corner. I usually use the middle lane when possible to avoid this, but sometimes you get stuck there since the three lanes don't always change at once.

I usually exit the 101 North at Fairview and need to turn left, so I just turn into the Shell station and cut across that way. It's stupid, but cuts five minutes off the trip, waiting for the light.

When headed from the Fairview shopping center, or Fairview itself headed toward the freeway, I have found that using the alley that connects Fairview to Lemos etc. works well if you want to get to the main shopping area on Calle Real. You can usually turn into this alley and exit on to Calle Real relatively easy.

The main problem is that the idiots that designed the overpass created additional turns that slow everything down. This should never have been allowed. I am also annoyed that some moron authorized a million dollar budget to replace the plum trees with more plum trees, and lots of unnecessary irrigation too. Whoever authorized this should be fired immediately, there is no reason or benefit for these stupid trees that no one can, or should access. What should have been planted are the trees etc. that you can find by Los Carneros, that are much more practical, and better looking set of on ramps and off ramps. Fairview has a useless plum tree orchard in the middle of traffic. Stupid.

If more of us find ways to circumvent the idiotic intersection (and annoy the local merchants), this horribly designed intersection may get an overhaul. If everyone continues to just sit there and wait, it will never get fixed.

No, they do not. There are homeless advocates at these cleanups, do you think they're going to allow the homeless to be dumped on some bus to be run out of town? What does happen with the homeless that were moved off the Venice Beach boardwalk then?

"I've seen these people attack others, leaving them scarred with PTSD and watch the system give the homeless individual all the resources in the world while their victims get nothing. I've sat through the cases where they sue to be off their medication and out of institutions. But then they don't want to be responsible for when they hurt someone. I've lived in cities where they spun some bull about how a new homeless shelter would ""help families struggling with high housing costs"" and then watched as the homeless shelter turned around and designated half of the beds for sex offenders from all over the country making it impossible for any family to take advantage of shelter services. Why? They get more federal funding for housing that population.

I saw one case where the homeless shelter say they'd take a dangerous sex offender parolee who stayed exactly one day in their program. He'd drive two cities away to his job everyday and then return to live in his van in this progressive city every night where no one said anything for two years about his heroin dealing. He raped at least another 4 women who would pass out in his van after shooting up. No one knows quite how many he raped in that time period because some of the drug addicts were homeless and probably didn't report it. I've read the case of the unsuspecting tourist who thought she'd go for a run after a long flight and thought the beautiful little city was safe and got raped by the homeless dude living next to the bike path.

I could go on and on and on, but I've learned people like you are never convinced and you don't give a crap about the neighbors left to deal with this garbage. When they start camping, pooping and freaking out on the sidewalks of the million dollar homes next to the mission or up in the hills, let's talk. These people are never in Montecito are they?

"You really should consider Goleta. I would say most UCSB affiliates live in Goleta or Noleta (the unincorporated area between Goleta and SB). It‚Äôs not a dead suburb. There are some amazing public spaces, good shopping for essentials, and a farmers market. Plus, you can be downtown in like 10 minutes flat, so it‚Äôs nothing like being in the outer suburb of a big city. Goleta is probably closer to downtown than most ‚Äúin town‚Äù neighborhoods in a big city, at least in terms of travel time.

Isla Vista is the real student living area. Avoid that at all costs. But most undergrads never leave the UCSB/Isla Vista bubble. They might go to Target periodically, but they‚Äôre generally not much of a presence in the residential areas of Goleta.

"We (Santa Barbara) don't get any water from the Colorado river. We get the vast majority of our water from the Santa Ynez river watershed, i.e. rainfall on the mountains just north of us. That's augmented with some supplies from local groundwater, desalination, and some State Water Project water, a giant aquiduct carrying water from the Sacremento and Feather rivers in Northern California.

Even in parts of CA that do get water from the Colorado river aquiduct, it's generally not the majority supply. Claremont (east of LA), for instance uses about 1/3 Colorado River water, 1/3 State Water Project water (from northern CA), and 1/3 local groundwater.

"Excerpts:

>This latest cut will affect even the water agencies and big farming operations north of the Delta from which Stokes has purchased ‚Äúsupplemental‚Äù water during past droughts. Those supplemental water supplies‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâwhich were shipped south through the vast spiderweb of pipes and pumps that have made the State Water system invaluable even when it had little water to spare‚Äâ‚Äî‚Äâsaved Santa Barbara‚Äôs bacon during the last drought. Now it appears the last drought and the current drought are part of what meteorologists describe as one big ‚Äúmega-drought.‚Äù

>Statewide, the drought is changing the face of California agriculture. The Washington Post reported that 400,000 acres of California ag-land are now lying fallow because of the drought, resulting in an estimated loss of $1.1 billion and 9,000 jobs.

>Little wonder Governor Gavin Newsom authorized the expenditure of $22.8 million on drought emergency measures, mostly to preach the gospel of conservation. In Santa Barbara, however, city residents are already using about 25 percent less water today than they were in 2013.

Most citizens here can‚Äôt conserve any more.

Sat: Outdoor at Girsh Park \~12:00. Very busy. Skill level more varied than UCSB crowed and mixes in more old head types. This run seems to be by far the most active in the SB / Goleta / IV area.

Paige Center has rentable courts for private runs, or open gym for $5/use but that's weekdays 10am-2PM.

YMCA on Hitchcock has 1 (edit: 2!) indoor court(s). I suspect that will be the only real indoor run in Santa Barbara proper but hopefully a member can confirm that here. Mask mandate was only recently dropped so may not be consistent yet anyways.

I know this is not what you asked but pasta is incredibly easy to make.  You don't even need to measure ingredients...just a well of flour and eggs.  Roll out with a pin or even a wine bottle.  Cut with a knife into as thin as you want.  Boil for 3 minutes in salted water and you will be very happy.
