"Does he have rainbow collar? On the Ring app there were 2 events about a tabby cat today. The first: ""young tabby cat w/ rainbow collar Seen wandering behind my house. Has a flea collar and rainbow collar. I couldn't get it. My dogs scared it off."" That was posted around 8pm on 4/1/22. The second that was responding to the first: ""Just saw orange tabby crawl in Covert on corner of se 46th st and 11 place with collar."" That was posted around 9pm on 4/1/22. 

Not sure if either are related to your cat or to each other.

"CAPE CORAL, FL. — Former Lee County Sheriff Deputy Niko Irizarry next court was set on Monday, a month after he was arrested on a felony charge for misconduct.  
Irizarry was arrested on February 11, 2022, along with Charles Custodio and Scott Snider. The trio was arrested for allegedly planting drugs in a Cape Coral man's car.  
According to the police report, text messages revealed that Custodio texted Irizarry asking him to arrest a person he has ""hatred"" towards. Custoadio claimed that the victim was a drug dealer and that he offered Irizarry sexual favors along with a trip to Paris if he would help him. Irizarry agreed to the terms according to the report.  
Text messages also showed that Custodio named Snider as the accomplice to help plant the drugs and set the victim up at a certain location for Irizarry to tail him and arrest him.

Three days after the text exchange, Irizarry attempted to arrest the victim but was unsuccessful.  
The following day on December 16th, text messages showed that Irizarry contacted Custodio to let him know he was in the area in an unmarked car.  
Custodio is accused of luring the victim to the location where Irizarry could find him.  
Irizarry located the victim's car and pulled him over for failing to stop at a stop sign. During the stop, Irizarry asked for a narcotics K-9. During the search, Irizarry found fentanyl, methamphetamine, oxycodone pills, and Xanax pills.  
The victim denied any knowledge of the drugs being in the car, but Irizarry still arrested him.

In January someone made a complaint to the internal affairs office. The Lee County Sheriffs Office narcotics unit investigated the allegations that the drugs were planted.  
In early February of 2022, police issued a search warrant for Irizarry's cellphone and found the text messages between him and Custodio.  
On February 11th, 2022 all three men were arrested according to the police report and Irizarry admitted that he falsified documents and lied under oath.  
Niko Irizarry was arrested on the following charges:  
Felony Official Misconduct  
Charles Custodio was arrested on the following charges:  
Trafficking in Fentanyl  
4 Counts Possession of Controlled Substance  
Conspiracy  
Scott Snider was arrested on the following charges:

ABOUT KNOW NONSENSE TRIVIA CHALLENGE

A Know Nonsense Trivia Challenge consists of three question rounds of seven questions each, as well as three bonus point quizzes (one per round, which can include picture and audio clues). After each round’s points are tallied, the correct answers are announced by the Quizmaster, as well as the leaderboard and winning team of each round. In the event of a tie, bonus point performance will determine the round’s winning team. In case of a further tie, teams will send a player to participate in a tie-breaker challenge against a member of the opposing team(s)!

Teams may choose to double the points of one correct answer per round and wager up to 21 points on the Know Nonsense question, the final question of the quiz! Each quiz’s last place team shall be dubbed the “biggest learners” and gain the right to select (in secret) the category for the following quiz’s Know Nonsense Question.

"That’s putting it blunt. I listened to the entire complicit podcast. Throughout I had different thoughts of what could of happened to her, but always kept asking myself if drugs were involved. In the end when victor talks about ecstasy use, it immediately brought an entirely new vision to life for me. Methamphetamine is loaded in ecstasy, that wound explain her mental state, profuse sweating, weight loss, and ultimately with much respect to the family likely the reason for her disappearance. She could have been so out of her mind from the drug induced state, lack of sleep, etc…that she got herself into a life threatening situation…
Though there are other things that stand out and should weigh in…Her phone being left at the apartment. Did she fear she was being tracked on the phone and didn’t take it, or did something sinister happen in the apartment and her phone was missed while her belongings deposited at the park. Did her shirt wash up on the sandy area they talk about…is there water with a tide near by? Who was the last communication with on her phone via text? Josh? He claims to have seen her at 10 but the phone call to gabby was made at 10 via messenger and pinged in her apartment, or did he live that close that she was connected to wifi still at that point. When gabby called Laurens father, what device did he call from? Was it checked to see if he had Paul’s number listed as a contact in his own phone or did he use Lauren’s to get the number and call from his own device? Her life had meaning, just because she was crippled with addiction doesn’t mean her value is lessened. She deserves to be found. The family deserves answers.",t2_4fdo106x,BreDini,0,1644415114.0,0,t1_hw83ogv,hw83ogv,False,Complicit_Podcast,t3_mlgl5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/mlgl5j/lauren_dumolo_is_still_missing/,Lauren Dumolo is Still Missing,/r/capecoral/comments/mlgl5j/lauren_dumolo_is_still_missing/hw83ogv/,1,r/capecoral,0,1

Most people who live in Florida want a tan. If you do in cape coral and want to go to a beach bigger than your back yard you have to drive out of city. You can't even fish anymore unless it's at a pier, since the city posted up signs on every single canal. Which by the way we have more canals than any other city in the world. They have Mike green wells and it's literally just go karts and paintball. Fort Myers has every single thing cape coral has and even more to do. They have Dave and busters and zoomers in comparison to Mike green wells. Any new addition to cape coral is just a revamped version of something we already have. Maybe a new Culvers or a car wash?

"Honestly don't find navigating the cape difficult except veterans during commute hour which I avoid.  

Mario's is way better than Peasanos on Lafayette, at least IMO.  Fresher and cleaner, but I visit them as well occasionally along with the Latin markets and asian leaf by the mall.

We don't eat out much,  so I do some specialty shopping for home cooked meals.

It's nice to have an alternative to publix, walmart, aldi, but prices weren't anything to brag about, some items were quite high IMO, like 9.99 for a roto chicken, that's a lot, especially during grand opening.  Also if I'm going to pay $22lb for my strip I'd probably run to Mario's in Ft Myers, which is great if you never visited.

Tons of workers, very friendly, overall an interesting experience, will visit again when the crowds die down and I can wander around without being mobbed.

"I think if you guys are remote and homebodies you will like it. You can go out occasionally and find tons to do, but it's also largely residential so you can stay home and enjoy life (that's what we do). I'm not sure what your interests are, but there is alot to do in the Cape, and definitely tons to do in the surrounding areas like Fort Myers and (a bit of a drive) Naples.

Beaches and boating/fishing not far away, so when you feel like leaving home you have plenty to do. We are not much in to the bar scene as we are early 40's with kids so we don't get out much lol, but I heard it's decent in downtown cape.

They Florida Keys are a manageable drive distance away (I think it's like 3-6 hours depending on which Key you go to). You can also take a boat out of Fort Myers to the Keys and it takes I think 90 minutes, but a bit pricey.

Some cons:

One thing I miss about living in a different area near a big city is we don't get many great concerts down here, atleast not mainstream music. We moved down maybe 4 years ago and that is what I miss the most (and honestly never thought that would be what I miss). You will occasionally get some older bands that are great that come through, but all the mainstream stuff you have to drive to Tampa/Miami for. Luckily they are only 1 1/2 - 2 hour drives.

One other con again is if you like to attend sport stuff, there isn't much here other than Spring Training for baseball and some minor league stuff. Gotta take the drive to Tampa/Miami for that stuff too, but again it's not that bad of a drive.

All in all, other than we are a bit older and have some kids, we ""sound"" similar to you guys.

"I began to type out a similar lengthy response to the OP's question then saw this.
 
Its spot on, 100%.  

I recommend the cape, but it suits me nicely for all the reasons above.

Pretty much a homebody myself, but got heavy into the watersports, and really enjoyed my time out there.  

one addition, IMO the cape does a GREAT job with city services for the most part, very efficient and far exceeding expectations especially for those that left larger metro area's with clogged and inefficient cities.   

They stay on top of the roads, respond to complaints, and tend to spend their income steam wisely in my experience and the schools (+ school choice) are really good.

con's:  If you like nightlife, or want to find food at midnight, the cape is not a good fit.

"Lived here since 2019. There are a lot of nice parks and restaurants, but little in the way of nightlife. Renting can be a crapshoot, but that's the situation everywhere these days; don't expect to rent the same place for longer than a year or two, because the homeowner will want to sell while prices are high. If you can afford to buy a house, go for it - but prices are nuts (better than in Tampa at least, where I used to live).

Fort Myers has more variety and activity but definitely feels less classy (and there is definitely some classism at play - Cape Coral people tend to look down at Fort Myers people). I like the quiet of Cape Coral, but it can feel like a ghost town when The Season is over and the snowbirds return north. The schools around here are pretty great if you have kids, though. FL public schools generally have a poor reputation, but Cape Coral schools seem like the exception.

Anecdotally, my number 1 issue is with the obnoxious Trump humpers in the area. You'll almost never see support for Biden or the Democrats, but Trump 2024 flags and cars are all over. Literally had a check out clerk tell me ""Let's go Brandon"" a couple weeks back. Back in 2020 there were weekly car parades for him.

"I am 52 and my wife 38. we have 2 Children, 8 and 2. we have been in the cape since 2018 and lived in Ft Myers for almost a year previous to that.

The Cape is quiet and as stated has a larger percentage of older people. it has been our experience that its a great place to live. several great parks/playgrounds, a few good places to eat. Not much nightlife, they do have a small area with a few bars but not much other than that. Jobs are mostly service or retail, the cape doesn't have much in the way of employment variety. However, many working age people in the cape commute into Ft. Myers daily and Ft. Myers offers a better selection of entertainment options. 

My advice would be to rent a place at first and get to know the area. but if you like quiet morning/evening walks, coffee/wine beside your pool, fishing, boating, mostly friendly neighbors and a good 4th of July fireworks show the cape might be a good fit.

PS - I am not sure if you plan on having children but before we moved here from Connecticut, many people told us the Florida schools were terrible. It gave us serious concern because we had a child just about to start school.

"Net neutrality wouldn't really help us with this as NN deals with the idea of treating all data the same as it passes through their networks and has nothing to do with who can provide it and their ability to protest a city creating their own ISP and things of that nature.

This is more an issue of declaring internet access a utility and regulating it as a business to help ensure equal access.

Making it a utility and having regulations has both pros and cons but like anything else in life, if you look at what the lobbyists for the ISPs push for, it is usually contrary to the public interest.

Its a massively complicated issue that isn't without problems but i feel like regulation as a utility would massively benefit us as consumers because ISPs are utterly incapable of upgrading their field equipment in a fair fashion.

As a technician for a large ISP i can tell you a lot about the issue though most of it would sounds like random buzzwords without some basic knowledge of how it all works.

The most basic point i can make is: once a system is installed, they'll run it till it turns dust if upgrading doesn't have the lowest ROI and projected penetration rates. It doesn't just have to be projected to pay itself off im a reasonable amount of time, but the lowest in the area and is competing for budget allocation against other areas, never mind some of my equipment was installed in the late 90s and have paid themselves off 100 times over. I hate having to support 20 year old equipment. It's sad TBH...

We've literally refused to do any retrofits to some communities unless they sign 10 year contracts and other companies came in and installed their own stuff.

Without regulations, isps will only spend money where they'll get maximum returns and with sometimes anticompetitive contracts required to do it.

Anyways, obligatory mention that these are my own opinions, they don't represent that of the company, i don't represent the company, i just work there and I'm not mentioning who they are in this post.

"I'm a bit late to this but I just wanted to correct this for anyone browsing it later: CenturyLink's gig fiber service is, in fact, a ""gig"". Being ethernet based a portion of that is used for addressing and encapsulation and so actual payload bandwidth is 940Mbps up and down but that's because ethernet and IP have an overhead cost like anything else does. 1000Mbps is the raw bandwidth, 940Mbps is usable. All ISPs in the US rate their connections in this manner, we go by the raw bandwidth in bits per second.

Even LAN ethernet works like this. We'll say a computer has a ""gigabit ethernet port"" but really if you were to local network 2 PCs via gigabit and transfer a file between them, the max bandwidth they'll hit is 940Mbps as the rest is used in overhead. 

The reason you're getting 400 on wifi is because wifi itself often doesn't hit a gig no matter how good the signal is, despite theoretical maximums per channel supposedly being able to hit 800 Mbps on Wifi5, realistically you get maybe 400 per channel and mobile devices rarely sport 2 antennas. If the gateway and your device support 2x2 mode, you could hit 800Mbps fairly reliably. 

I also have CL gig service at my house in the cape, my main rig is direct wired and I get 940Mbps up and down, my wifi devices vary wildly between 150 and 300 depending on where I am in the house.",t2_gi0ip,wkdzel,0,1637077466.0,0,t1_hkv4rug,hkv4rug,False,Sixtyhurts,t3_ql9okx,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/ql9okx/best_isp_in_cape_coral/,Best ISP in Cape Coral?,/r/capecoral/comments/ql9okx/best_isp_in_cape_coral/hkv4rug/,3,r/capecoral,0,3

"Hi, everybody. If you live around El Dorado and Tropicana, please let me know if you’ve seen our cat!! He was last seen Saturday, Oct. 30th around 10p. He’s a 1.5 yr old male Bengal Mix - he answers to ‘Seb’ and ‘Papita’ if you happen to see/find him. 

We’ve gone out looking multiple times since then and put flyers in every mailbox we could, unfortunately there’s seems to be absolutely 0 sign of him. This makes us believe he may have gone into a garage or patio (trying not to think of the canals 😥). 

If you have any suggestions of where to post this, please let me know.

It's technically against the local law to rent for less than a week or so but they don't check. So expect noisy temporary neighbors.,t2_bj5bh,Orcus424,0,1633886683.0,0,t1_hg4io4t,hg4io4t,True,Mizz-Robinhood,t3_q4x088,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/q4x088/do_you_think_cape_coral_has_gotten_more_or_less/,Do you think Cape Coral has gotten more or less crowded by tourists since the start of the pandemic?,/r/capecoral/comments/q4x088/do_you_think_cape_coral_has_gotten_more_or_less/hg4io4t/,3,r/capecoral,0,3

"Howdy and welcome! So you say the Fort Myers area, but will you be living in Cape? Both FM and CC have arts schools, but school choice can be difficult to navigate as transplants lol. Age plays a huge role as well as the FM arts school has a middle and high school and the CC only has a high school (which makes it a bit more difficult to get the arts high school. North Cape will be more quiet, but further away from any activities your kids may want to be involved in after school, central/south cape is busier and closer to everything, but you may be closer to your job in fort myers depending on where that is located. Cape Coral has one hospital where Fort Myers has three (though most anything mote severe than a broken arm will be sent to a FM hospital. 

I graduated back in 2018 and am currently mentoring a 7th grader, two 8th graders, and a sophomore in high school. The 7th and one of the 8th graders are in Cape while the other two are in fort Myers and everybody goes to vastly different schools respectively. The most important thing you can do is to do tours of the school in the city you are interested in moving to (I have a cheat sheet for CC high schools) and ask questions. School choice is based on availability and largely on grades. We also have sibling preference where if the eldest goes to ""school A"", the youngest is guaranteed to go to school A as well as long as school A is first on the school choice request. 

I wouldn't worry about most neighborhoods within reason. As a rule of thumb, we don't go to Suncoast Estates or Dunbar (the neighborhood around Dunbar high) due to higher average crime rates. Realistically, move to where your needs are taken care of and then branch out for wants. The joke around here is that Cape is where the old go to d*e. Back when CC was in its developmental stages, the idea is that you would live in CC and work in FM. That is no longer the idea, but certainly is the case for many of us.

Crime is mostly petty don’t leave your doors unlocked Car doors especially ! There are some crimes of passion stabbing and shootings - drug deals coming from across the bridge but since the Biden cash has stopped most of that has stopped.  Fresh water canal vs salt water canal big difference for type of boat and docking vs boat lift.  If you salt water fish and leave you boat at a marina and like to let the Marina service it and put it away store it on a rack you don’t have to live on a canal you can buy a bigger house cheaper off the water! But I like living on the canals.  I moved to the Cape from FMB because FMB is a disaster trying to get on and of in emergencies I have health problems.  The Cape is very convenient for medical care.

"We did the pro, but kind of depends on what and where you are going I guess.  If you are just in FL then its probably fine to do the mini, but it looks like the pro works all along the eastern seaboard, so probably worth the extra 10 bucks if you value the flexibility.

Either way its definitely worth getting one, its like 2 bucks with sunpass.

"Capes not bad, it's pretty low key.  You have access to Sanibel and Captiva (about a 35-50 minute drive) also Matlacha has kind of an island vibe, has fresh seafood, and I think you can rent kayaks there. My personal preference for beaches is white sand, but I haven't really seen that around here.  My favorite beach around here is probably lighthouse on Sanibel.  Fort Meyers beach area is pretty touristy but the beach is decent, and shouldn't be too packed in November.

For food, check out the Lobster Lady if you like seafood. Two meatballs is supposed to be good, haven't had it myself.  Fords Garage is not bad, they had some decent beers there. Nice guys pizza and beer food was good, and they have some wild cocktails.  The boat house is kind of a must if you visit, usually just get drinks there and not food.  Also would recommend the Yukatan bar and grill on Matlacha, sit out side right on the water. 

Also probably worth noting - you may want to check into getting a sunpass (for the tolls).  The two southern bridges have tolls(only charge when travelling from ft meyers to the cape), but the northern bridge does not(41).  The rental car places gouge big time, so if you have your own sunpass its probably cheaper or breakeven.",t2_4kzpb,llN3M3515ll,0,1632057365.0,0,t1_hdgjpuf,hdgjpuf,True,Almost_thereFL51,t3_pr6nu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/pr6nu2/vacation_time_in_november/,Vacation time in November!!!,/r/capecoral/comments/pr6nu2/vacation_time_in_november/hdgjpuf/,7,r/capecoral,0,7

She has to pass the PERT test (super easy) & she can take classes at FSW. My sister tells me that it is not worth it to do the AP classes at North that count as college credits. Dual enrollment is going to actual college.

"I also just moved to the Cape from Denver, been here only a few months though. I cannot begin to describe how much better SW FL is than Denver. In nearly every measurable way it is better than Denver...aside from quick access to snow sports. The people have been nothing short of lovely to me. The guys at the fishing store have taken me under their wing and are teaching me everything I need to know. My realtor took me out on his boat 3x to demonstrate the difference in boating access depending on where you live. I chose the NW cape because it is a bit more rural and has a fast access canal that bypasses the very busy river and yacht club area. There are essentially no bugs here, just like Denver. They release millions of dragonflies and they just murder all the annoying bugs. I've seen zero snakes, gators, or sharks though I've been assured they are here. 

I bought a house that is 60 years newer, twice as big, and cost 60% of the what the house I sold in Denver was that had a homeless camp less than a mile away occupying a major park. There is almost none of that here. The local government is way more active in keeping the community safe and quiet. Just look at the crime stats and you will see how much safer it is here than anywhere in Denver proper.   


My guess is the people here are just mad locals that don't want people from out of town coming to enjoy their little secret. I don't even want to go back to Denver for a visit and I'm 37 years old and never lived anywhere else in my life aside from college.",t2_413j7,TruthBomb,0,1631548922.0,0,t1_hcpdoh2,hcpdoh2,True,mdave11991,t3_pi3bnk,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/pi3bnk/my_fiancé_and_i_are_planning_on_moving_to_cc/,My Fiancé and I are planning on moving to CC,/r/capecoral/comments/pi3bnk/my_fiancé_and_i_are_planning_on_moving_to_cc/hcpdoh2/,2,r/capecoral,0,2

"It eliminates a lot of potential headaches, insurance cost and obviously home maintenance items.

My house is 86 and I love it, but I've kept it up too.  Insurance costs me just over 3000 total for home and flood but lately friends and neighbors have told me some crazy prices.  My wind inspection guy and insurance dude gave me a really good education which was helpful, fortunately by chance I happen to have most of the good credits, others were not so lucky and are paying quite a bit more.

"In the insurance biz and this is spot on.  Two 90's homes next to each other can be priced from 2200 annual to 3500 depending on wind credits.  Gable roofs + $600, no shutters +200, no hurricane straps (or 2 nails) +800.  Roof 15+ = only a handful if carriers will even provide a quote.  The roofs are a huge deal right now.

One caveat,  if you go with a 2004 or newer, you basically get max wind credits so gables dont impact the premium as much or at all with most carriers.

So do your own dd if going older, get a current wind mit and 4pt along with the healthy home inspection.  Sometimes the previous owner neglected things like the gutters, shutoff valves, hvac.  A proactive previous owner takes care if the little things that can turn into big things.

Check flood zones too, zone B is really cheap for flood coverage under current guidelines, get the elevation certificate, pre-firm or -0- elevations can get quite pricey.

"Advice if buying, theres a bit of a home insurance mess going on in Florida.

Look for homes 2004 or newer, hip roof not gable, if roof is shingle look for one under 10 yrs.  This will keep home insurance prices low because you will get good wind credits and not be blocked out from shopping with insurance carriers that are avoiding older shingle roofs.

"Honestly, the people.  Everyone is from somewhere else and there is no sense of community.  Everyone calls “home” a different state. People are so shitty to one another.  It’s hard to even get decent service at a restaurant.  It’s awful.  The tourists are ass holes because they are only here for a short time and don’t give a shit.  They feel entitled to do what they want or get ahead by any means because “it’s my vacation”. The people who live here act the same way because “I pay taxes here” and are sick of the tourists acting like ass holes.  Being nice here is not rewarded, it just gets you pushed out of the way by some entitled ass hat.  I do not enjoy being an ass hole but you have to be around here.

"The best bet is summer time.  That will get you local women or transplants, and it can happen anywhere, just don't be shy and say hello.  Find places that have a more ""local"" feel, i.e. not chain bars.  Having a good wingman can help too.  One time on an island near boca grande, these two realtor women took turns getting double teamed by my buddy and I on a yacht the two of them had rented for a weekend.  That whole event was spawned by us wanting to just go grab a beer randomly.  But it really requires persistence.  These are working women, often divorced, and they know what they want and know how to party.  If you have some cash, try staycations at resorts on Captiva, FMB, or pricier places like Palm Island (I'm a west coast guy).  Good luck my man!

"Big fan of Pinnacle Builders

My neighbor built one so I had the opportunity to watch it go up during every stage and they were super nice, I happen to meet the owner because he was doing a construction video on youtube and he patiently waited with his camera guy while I buzzed around on my mower finishing up my lawn.    

I ended up watching several of the youtube videos and subscribing for updates because it was cool to see the progress from my couch :)     When the home was almost done and they were smoothing out the dirt and putting in the swale for drainage they were very considerate about my palm trees which were very close to the property line, that was much appreciated. 

I've been in my home for 20+ years and its almost time for an upgrade to my final retirement home, when I'm ready to build these guys will be my first option.

"Waste Pro has, like many other companies recently, been experiencing a severe worker shortage to the point that the city of Cape Coral was considering fining them for being unable to pick up waste and recyclables, in some area for over a damn month. They had to contract other companies (I had a tree service picking up my bulk items several weeks in a row in lieu of WastePro trucks).

Basically, just leave it out and let WastePro do their thing, if it takes too long, the city will probably get on their asses again.

With Corona and the stimulus/employment benefits, people just don't want to go back to work for peanuts. Minimum wage is laughably low which is why it's going up to 15 over the next several years here in FL. It'll be 10 by the end of the year and every year go up a dollar: [https://www.jacksonlewis.com/publication/florida-voters-approve-15-minimum-wage](https://www.jacksonlewis.com/publication/florida-voters-approve-15-minimum-wage)

Honestly, WastePro should just pay people more to entice people to come work for them. They have a contract with the city, guaranteed work, pay people more to get the job done. I had yard waste on my curb for 2 weeks before they go around to it.

So yea, I just leave shit on the curb because if we just shuffle it around so that it isn't seen then the city won't have ammo to go after WastePro with. The worse shit looks, the more the city has to get on WastePro's ass.",t2_gi0ip,wkdzel,0,1628781128.0,0,t1_h8nvt76,h8nvt76,True,[deleted],t3_p31gzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/p31gzx/new_resident_waste_pro_usa_extra_recycling/,New resident - Waste Pro USA extra recycling collection question,/r/capecoral/comments/p31gzx/new_resident_waste_pro_usa_extra_recycling/h8nvt76/,3,r/capecoral,0,3

""America should never go abroad in search of monsters to destroy""

The people of Cuba support the communists because they remember what it was like to be a slave colony of the US complete with a military puppet. We got cheap sugar, they lost their land. 

Castro took a country of millions with 3 boats and a few dozen men because they were willing to use violence against their oppressors across the water to gain independence and self determination, so the Cubans joined him in revolution and havent faltered even in the face of literal terrorism by our government, 60 years later. 

We call our revolutionaries ""patriots"" but 250 years later i see people calling themselves proud Americans advocate for military intervention to replace a foreign state that clearly has a mandate.

"Coworkers of mine are relating similar stories, put in an offer 50k over asking, still got outbid. My new supervisor moving in from out of state took 2 weeks to find something decent that didn't already have an offer on it and that was only about a week ago he secured a home. He was supposed to be down here 3 weeks ago and had 2 months notice. I would say we're closer to a bubble collapsing than the market stabilizing but predicting the future is obviously tough for anyone to do.

I honestly wouldn't forego an inspection. That shit is important. I know VA loans can be problematic in a high demand area because the delay means the seller would prefer to take a lower offer that closes faster than to wait for a VA loan to close but that's up to you. Honestly, is there any particular reason you're desperate to buy \*right now\* as opposed to waiting for the market to chill the fuck out? I'd rather rent a place than buy right now IMO, feels like this could be a bubble on the verge of collapse, it certainly isn't the bottom of an elevator ride up in value, that elevator left months ago.

That's just my 2 cents though.

Call me cynical but I'm always careful on taking the advice of a person getting paid on commission for the obvious reasons. You're just a paycheck to them. The more expensive a house you buy, the more they make, which incentivizes them to push you to make decisions that are bad for you, but good for them.

Do what's right for you.

"Realistically, it does suck for dogs and vets and even people scared of fireworks in general. However I don’t think they should be illegal all around. They’re illegal year round except 2 days out of the entire year. One celebrating (America) which we live in, and independence. The other celebrating new year’s and the more to come. So no, they shouldn’t be illegal on the two days out of the 365 days. I hate that it does affect dogs and other things and I can see the annoyance and the frustration from the “litter” and multiple other reasons I’m sure people can list. But fireworks are a fun thing a VERY large portion of the entire country loves to watch and do and celebrate with. Maybe take some pride in the holiday, and not blow up fireworks or anything but just enjoy them for what the symbolize.

Despite new state law, Pinellas bans fireworks  
Despite the state law that was signed by the governor in April 2020, Pinellas County issued a stern warning Tuesday that personal fireworks are not legal without the “proper permits.”  
“A new state law allowing the purchase of fireworks for use on three holidays does not supersede local regulations,” a Pinellas news release said.  
Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the law that allows Florida residents to legally use fireworks, but only for three days out of the year: New Year’s Day, July Fourth and on New Year’s Eve.  
That’s a big change from the decades-old precedent that said all fireworks, defined as anything that leaves the ground or explodes, were illegal to sell or set off in Florida. Loopholes in the restrictions (such as promising you are buying them only to scare off birds from your crops) made enforcement difficult.  
Police and prosecutors have found the laws hard to enforce and the State Attorney’s Office for Pinellas and Pasco counties said it could find only a single person ever prosecuted for the fireworks statute, in 2006.  
The 2020 law specifically notes that it’s not intended to supersede any local fireworks laws. It notes that while a homeowner’s association can have fireworks restrictions in its legally executed covenants, an HOA board can’t otherwise just pass rules to restrict your right to use fireworks. If it’s not in the covenants, you are free to fire away.  
“The bottom line is that the state legislature wrote this bill to address the reality of the situation,” Orange Park retailer Superior Fireworks wrote on its blog after the law passed. “People are  
buying and using all types of fireworks on these holidays anyway, not just the ground-based novelties and fountains, so it makes sense to go ahead and specifically allow it.”  
Pinellas County said its ban covers virtually all fireworks except sparklers and “paper caps.” Supervised public display of fireworks is allowed only with a permit from the appropriate fire district.  
“Pinellas County Safety and Emergency Services reminds residents and visitors of the county’s ban on the retail sale, purchase or use of fireworks, and to practice fire safety at home and with pets this coming holiday,” the release says.  
The news release goes on to stress the affects of fireworks on veterans coping with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and pets, who tend to get stressed and run away from home on July 4.  
“We did a similar press release last year, that this law does not supersede the county’s ban,” said Pinellas County spokeswoman Sydney Criteser. “Our main purpose was to provide the safety tips. Just a reminder.”

"I assume you're asking about flood insurance in the Cape? Generally speaking, the city is broken into flood zones. However, each property is ""x"" feet above sea level, so it depends.   There are maps for all this I cannot link, but a google search will get you close.  

FYI: The last ""big"" hurricane that came through, didn't flood anything.  In fact, the issue was water being sucked out of the canals, leaving no pressure on the sea walls, so many older walls failed.  Point being, each property and neighborhood has it's specifics...NOT ADVERTISING, just saying, that's why you get a RE Agent, as a buyer, it costs you nothing.

"So in other words, I can make $4000/month if vacation renters break stuff.....which I get to determine what the cost is, and they get to dispute it for months on end!  Most vacation renters don't want the hassles and don't want to be leaving $1000 on the table after their vacation is over.  I know MANY vacation landlords and most have no problems with their vacation renters, especially the higher end stuff.  Most become regular renters!  The vacation rental business is not the same as the full time rental business.",t2_a5mmqvcn,CapeGreg767,0,1624932770.0,0,t1_h3e7eqw,h3e7eqw,False,jess_suj,t3_o9op1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/o9op1n/gulf_access_vs_fresh_water/,Gulf access vs fresh water -,/r/capecoral/comments/o9op1n/gulf_access_vs_fresh_water/h3e7eqw/,1,r/capecoral,0,1
"Yeah, but an $1000 deposit (to cover damages) for only staying a week, is a lot more than renting for 12 months and then walking away from your deposit.  In the case of a vacation rental, it makes your vacation cost increase by 50% in some cases if the one week rental is $1000/week.",t2_a5mmqvcn,CapeGreg767,0,1624930886.0,0,t1_h3e3sk3,h3e3sk3,False,jess_suj,t3_o9op1n,https://www.reddit.com/r/capecoral/comments/o9op1n/gulf_access_vs_fresh_water/,Gulf access vs fresh water -,/r/capecoral/comments/o9op1n/gulf_access_vs_fresh_water/h3e3sk3/,1,r/capecoral,0,1
