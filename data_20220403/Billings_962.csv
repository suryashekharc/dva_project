"Just moved here and I’ve been in a similar search for the past month. I’m pretty surprised so far! I’ve found live music at multiple spots every weekend, went to a comedy show, signed up for a book club at the Billings Public Library. Yesterday I went to BloomFest and that Roots Garden Center and had lunch and checked out artist booths. There are maintained trails/greenways all over that I’m riding around on today. 

I started following the Billings Disc Golf community and Instagram and they seem to be very active. Pioneer Park was packed yesterday before the rain. 

There is the Purple 5k coming up this month that I’m looking forward to. Also there are some big bands coming this summer! A few I’m not a fan of, but Shakey Graves will be playing at the Zoo and I saw something about Kevin Gates coming??",t2_4r2bub09,turnsareillegal,0,1649003215.0,0,t1_i38mdad,i38mdad,True,Harry_Ronnov,t3_tuurtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/tuurtv/what_are_some_fun_events_places_businesses_groups/,"What are some fun events, places, businesses, groups, or attractions in Billings?",/r/Billings/comments/tuurtv/what_are_some_fun_events_places_businesses_groups/i38mdad/,2,r/Billings,0,2

"Businesses tailoring to social activities would be OX Indoor Ax Throwing, Sunset & Fireside Lanes, Brothers Billards in the heights. Those places have legues you can  sign up and meet new people. Many bars will put on events for pool games, darts, ect tournaments. 

Dragon Egg Games is a table top and board game store and they host DnD, Warhammer, Magic the Gathering games.
So does Splash Page and KAB, but the atmosphere at Dragon Egg is better.

On the sports side I know that Billings Amateur Softball is just starting up to, I'm sure there also legues for flag football, soccer, tenis, basketball also. 

Motorcycle groups will start doing poker runs and you don't have to have a bike to participate.

There are multiple car enthusiast groups, 4x4 truck groups, and outdoorsy clubs in the yellowstone county area.

There's also the Yellowstone Amature Radio Enthusiast group that help volunteer to coordinate communications on big marathon, triathlon and bicycle events.

Hell probably a couple crafting groups if you want to start something like woodworking, rug making, etc.

There's tons of professional associations of business folks that network for a lunch or dinner and talk about their jobs and what they do and their future business goals, if that's more your thing.

As much as people on reddit hate Facebook,  that's where most people advertize what's going on around town.
I'd suggest search for groups involing your interests there.",t2_fj60i,xragekittenx,0,1649000966.0,0,t1_i38gzal,i38gzal,True,Harry_Ronnov,t3_tuurtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/tuurtv/what_are_some_fun_events_places_businesses_groups/,"What are some fun events, places, businesses, groups, or attractions in Billings?",/r/Billings/comments/tuurtv/what_are_some_fun_events_places_businesses_groups/i38gzal/,3,r/Billings,0,3

"I agree, if people can afford to live somewhere then that's fine. The problem with that in regards to Montana is that we had a VERY rapid influx of people who came here and sent the markets into ranges we haven't seen in a long time, if ever.

"Hey guys, I am the one that sent that post card. I own Homestead Properties LLC. My company is not related to any other company outside of Billings. 

I'm an electrician, not a hedge fund. I currently own 2 rental properties and the house that I live in. I do buy properties to turn them into rentals because that's how I invest my money. I never understood stocks or bonds, but real estate always seem to make sense. I agree with you that investors are part of the reason for the increase in housing prices, but I don't think there is any stopping it. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. 

You're also right about buying properties for the lowest price possible. To be able to make a retirement out of this I have to buy properties with a sales price that allows me to make money. There are people out there who are willing to pay more than me, because they are buying a house as dwelling and not an investment. Because of this I have to make it worth it for someone to sell to me for less money. 

I do this by doing things that average buyers can't like being able to close quicker, allowing people to leave behind all the stuff they don't want, and paying for all the transaction fees so people don't have to come out of pocket with any money to sell their house. The last house I bought was from someone whose realtor told them their house was worth 350k. A week later they talked to me and told me they would sell for 315k if I could actually do the things listed on my postcard.

If you're in Billings and you ever want advice on how to buy rentals I'd be happy to answer any questions.

"The following is an excerpt from 
Under the Trapdoor - Part 4: The South Side neighborhood around the Colonial no easy street by ED KEMMICK. 

It's an old part of town and it looks it, full of potholed streets, weedy vacant lots and tidy little homes next door to tumble-down shacks. The most notorious corner in the area is the long, narrow lot at South 27th Street and Third Avenue South, where the Colonial Apartments has stood since 1918.
The Colonial has 28 apartments on four floors, including the basement. A worn carpet lines the basement hallway; on the other levels the crooked wooden floors are painted gray, and each floor has a community toilet and a community shower. The plaster walls are painted a faint yellow. Some of the apartment doors have heavy padlocks on the outside. The sickly sweet odor of urine permeates the whole place. Colonial calls keep cops busy…

""A lot of our suspects live at the Colonial, and a lot of victims live at the Colonial,"" Hinkle said. ""That's the cost of living down there, is being a victim every now and then.""
Hinkle said the Colonial, as busy as it keeps the cops, was probably more of a problem 20 and 30 years ago, when bars lined Montana and Minnesota avenues, prostitution was rampant and violent crimes were the order of the day.
""The Colonial's almost a holdover from that era, when that kind of lifestyle ruled that part of town,"" Hinkle said. ""It's the last remnant of that era.""

The Colonial might generate fewer police calls than it used to, but over the years it has lost little of its reputation for being a haven of last resort.
""If it ever burns down, all the cockroaches in that place are going to be running rampant on the South Side,"" said Police Lt. Tim O'Connell. ""It's filthy.""

As bad as it might seem, it does provide cheap housing for people, even teenagers, who wouldn't otherwise have a roof over their heads. A lot of kids have no place to go but to apartments like the Colonial, or to what used to be the vacant house across the street.
""People need a place to be,"" Hinkle said. ""Not every parent is a parent by your definition or my definition.""

 Charles Albert, the neighbor whose house is just a few dozen yards from the house where John Hyatt was killed, was vaguely aware that somebody had moved into the vacant house last summer, but he didn't think much about it.
""I could see they were living there, but they didn't bother me,"" he said.
That's the way the whole neighborhood operates, according to Glynn ""Knappy"" Slaton, who's lived in or next door to the Colonial since moving to Billings in 1999.
""If you go in there and mind your own business, listen to your music, it's really not that bad."" People in the Colonial, he said, ""either grew up with nothing or fell from high places.""
""Upper-middle-class people are gonna keep their houses tidy just to keep up appearances for the neighbors, even if you're going to the basement and beating up your wife. At the Colonial, you don't have to keep up appearances.""",t2_3s8l7zep,WhereasConscious9925,0,1647474106.0,0,t1_i0yacgv,i0yacgv,True,PleaseWithC,t3_tf4g0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/tf4g0h/the_colonial_your_stories/,The Colonial: Your Stories,/r/Billings/comments/tf4g0h/the_colonial_your_stories/i0yacgv/,4,r/Billings,0,4
"""Colonial"" is a depressingly apt name for the place. When my mom was doing home health visits in the 90's, she had patients who lived there. There was a bucket to piss in in the hall then.

 The PACT team at the Mental Health Center won't do home visits for patients who live there anymore because it's too big of a safety risk for their case workers, which is tragic.

"This made me so mad!!!

Choosing to spend a MASSIVE amount of money to replace trash cans that have nothing wrong with practically all of them, then turn around and ask for ANOTHER levy because they don’t have money for high schools?! What they spent on those cans could have covered 2/3 of the cost of the upcoming education levy. 

They’ve also gotten 2 recent public-safety levies because they claim they don’t have money to expand our stretched thin and overworked police force. 

If they need/needed all this money, what paid for the construction of the new building at the dump and this almost $1 million purchase of trash cans? 

This new system is a waste of money and completely ineffective unless we have a viable offering for recycling. Is this also requiring modifications to current trash collection vehicles for these routes because of the difference in diameter of the new cans?

If our crime is climbing at a concerning rate, and our education system is suffering, I would think that responsible city planning and budgeting would put trash cans at the bottom of the priorities. 

The jail is maxed out which is a major contributor to the crime because people know they’ll just get booked and released, some of our roads are in terrible condition, concerns of future water supply capacity, and traffic has exceeded the capabilities of several intersections. 

This is an embarrassing confirmation of an inability to be fiscally responsible. 🤬😡😤

"Step four...step five - past resident mail see post, step six deceased individuals mail see post, step seven - political mailers see post

Obtain your free annual credit reports (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion, Innovis).

https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0155-free-credit-reports

I suggest calling the phone number provided so your reports are mailed to your current address - keep these reports for your records. They will come in handy for many reasons - identity theft issues, record of past creditors (closed accounts drop from these reports after 10 years), etc.

Remove ALL phone numbers from these reports - help reduce your unwanted calls/texts, etc.

Your goal is to have ONE address variation for each correct address.

Your goal is to have ONE name variation - females - maiden/married - one each. NOTE: If you are having mail addressed in multiple names this will help correct that. Also, note that USPS mail sorting machines sort by the first three letters of the first/last name. So if you submit an USPS COA (change of address) ONLY in one name variation (Thomas vs Tom) then you won’t have ALL your mail forwarded.

Call the dispute number on the reports and ask the clerk what creditors are reporting said info. Contact the creditor update/remove/opt out of sharing & marketing. Do this with closed creditors as well. Just because an account is closed does NOT mean they won’t continue to share your info. They ONLY stop sharing when you have opted out!",t2_9iz1guig,Removeme80,0,1646353336.0,0,t1_hz95g1r,hz95g1r,True,Fizzlewicket,t3_rs85ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/rs85ew/how_to_get_rid_of_mail_advertisements/,How to get rid of mail advertisements,/r/Billings/comments/rs85ew/how_to_get_rid_of_mail_advertisements/hz95g1r/,1,r/Billings,0,1

"Shiloh Commons and InterUrban are very nice apartments on the West End. The West End is a pretty nice part of town, there are a ton of stores and restaurants and things to do.  

Avenue C apartments are luxury apartments in Midtown - as the name implies, in the middle of Billings. There’s a shopping center and restaurants right across the parking lot from Avenue C and you’d have easy access to anywhere else in town from there. 

There are several lofts downtown, I linked one below but you can find more on Google. 

The availability at these places is pretty low though, they’re popular. It can be pretty difficult to find an available rental in Billings right now. Welcome to Billings!

"I am early 30s but late 20s in my mind still. I also still feel like an outsider but the things I do pick up on are mostly positive. I think the music scene is good here especially relative to the population. The downtown scene is more trashy than I am used to but there are a few exceptions. West end is better IMO.

I wish there was more recreation close by. It's around but its a drive.

Food is decent but still lacking diversity and quality per capita.

The good ol boy system is also alive and well. It's very interesting to me how the normal methods of advertising don't really seem to work here. Events that you care about are not always well advertised. Amenities that you may be used to cannot always be found on Google etc. It's very strange, it's as if the accessibility and technology is 5-10 years behind.

Which leads me to a tangent, if you do any buying and selling nobody takes Venmo or Apple Pay. I recently talked to somebody 10 years my junior that said ""I don't trust any of that crap"". Just a lot of old school mentalities.

Crime is on my mind more than it used to be. I never cared to lock my doors, nor did anyone I knew in my last city which was just slightly smaller than Billings. Here it feels like a requirement no matter where you are.

People in general are not as friendly as I am used to.

The beer/wine regulation drives me crazy. It's such a conflict of interest to have the tavern association oversee beer and wine. Breweries hit different here in the sense that they are not as integrated into the community as they should be, needing to close at 8.

"In Billings, Thirsty Street allows dogs. They have two locations and both are friendly.  Even Undammed distillery besides their garage location will tolerate them if they’re not too big, if they’re behaved, and if the place isn’t too busy because it’s so small.  Canyon Creek also allows dogs. We are typically turned down, even on the patio.  For example, BAM is a no.  There’s a new dog park on the more west side of town and one in The Heights.  We have had bad encounters at the new one and prefer the environment of The Heights’s park.  In the area, the Rims and Swords Park have some great trails as well as Two Moon park and some nice views south of the city on Four Dances. There are petroglyphs nearby too with an easy trail. Depending on when you come though, we are about to get another winter storm and hit lows of -20.

Red Lodge is a really nice area not too far from here and in the summer you can take the Beartooth route to Yellowstone which is beautiful. As people were snowboarding on that pass in June last year, except it’s closed.  I love the pop up Sicilian place up there for food. There is Red Lodge brewing and I can’t remember if I’ve seen dogs there before or not but I largely found Red Lodge to be not dog friendly. Having most recently moved from Arizona, I find it strange how un-dog-friendly Montana can be despite all the dogs.  That’s why going to Thirsty in Billings is so nice and the trivia nights at their second location can get packed with people and dogs alike.

Edit: forgot two more things 

1. My coworker informed me AirBnb is actually not allowed in Billings proper but people do it anyway… haven’t fact checked that yet

"Billings Clinic is the one that is not participating with the new school. Also, to be clear neither Billings Clinic nor St. V's are directly partnered with the new Great Falls School. That school is partnered with the Benefis Health System.

The TLDR of this situation is that Billings Clinic claims that on two separate occasions representatives from Rocky Vista (the new school) made unsavory comments about the new Great Falls school being affiliated with the Jewish faith. Billings Clinic also claims a representative from Rocky Vista made a claim that one of Billings Clinic's female leaders was only in her role as token display of equality.

If Billings Clinic's statements are true, I think they made the right decision by pulling out of any potential partnership. Also, as pointed out, for profit schools are usually not a long term positive. But who knows, I was not in the room when those statements were potentially made.

Q2 did a decent write up of the situation including the press releases from both Billings Clinic and Rocky Vista.

"I’d say Billings is a town located near tremendous outdoor opportunities but not an actual outdoor town, sort of like Denver but on a significantly smaller scale.  While the outdoors is certainly part of the economy, it’s not the driving force.  Things are much more diversified. Still, the outdoors are always there and accessible.

As to mtb opportunities, you’ve mentioned the two most popular areas - Back Nine and Acton.  There is a great trail along the Rims between the edge of the cliffs and the Highway the entire length from Swords Park to Zimmerman Trail although access to and across Zimmerman is difficult. Once across Zimmerman Trail you’re  in Zimmerman Park with nice but limited riding but it does hook up with the Back Nine. Riverfront Park has some nice, if rather tame, riding. Further from town is the Red Lodge area with the Beartooths having some great trails and the Cottonwood Creek area south of Bridger with some good opportunities.",t2_bmqlb,hikerjer,0,1643734524.0,0,t1_hv5j66n,hv5j66n,True,Hungry_Oven_1045,t3_sgdrfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/sgdrfa/mtb_trails/,MTB trails,/r/Billings/comments/sgdrfa/mtb_trails/hv5j66n/,2,r/Billings,0,2

"I want to answer this in a neutral way if possible. I remember hearing that once you mentioned it so I looked it up on Outside Magazine and found [this](https://www.outsideonline.com/video/why-billings-montana-best-town-2016/) video from 2016. It talked a lot about beer, food, the small town feel and a little history. It goes on to talk about the river, the rims, and mountain biking, which ended up being the only ""outside"" elements to their take on Billings. They go back to talk a lot more about beer and finish with the people of Billings. 

I guess it just depends on your definition of an outdoor town. I suppose it kind of is, but in my opinion it's not in a very significant way. Most every city in the country has trails and mountain biking. Not every city has a river, but a lot do.

"Billings gets a bad rap especially from residents of other areas in the state.  I live in a downtown neighborhood and go walking with my dog all the time. Only once had a problem and that was with a mentally ill individual. The biggest problem is the rising drug activity and accompanying crime rate. The large transient and homeless problem is also an issue.  That said, these problems are lower than most cities it’s size and let’s face it, those are national issues and are hardly unique to Billings.  Common sense and staying away from drugs will go a long way in keeping you safe.  It’s still a very good place to live.  It has a vibrant and diverse economy and pretty decent schools.  Traffic is rarely an issue except for a few choke points at rush hour.  While  affordable housing is an issue, it’s still nowhere as bad as the situation in many parts of the state. The parks and trail systems are extensive and constantly expanding and outdoor activities are everywhere.  I suppose the one thing missing is professional entertainment if you’re into that kind of thing. 

I’ve lived here nearly all my life and raised my family here and have never regretted it.  There was a time I thought about leaving but after looking around, I didn’t see many other locales that had much more to offer, at least for me.  But then, I’m not big fan of spectator sports or eating out.  If those are important to you, you’ll be missing them.

I would make a trip to visit the city and research the various neighborhoods/parts of Billings. Crime is concentrated in certain areas so research will definitely benefit you. That said, I would take reasonable safety precautions in all areas of Billings. Lock your house and cars and don’t walk alone at nighttime.

"38 year resident of the front range of Colorado here. I've been in Billings for 5 years now.   I think the closest comparison would be Commerce City. Traffic problems are much better in Billings, crime per capita is higher, meth is a big problem here, as is public intoxication.  Wages are not very good here, expect them to be a third to half of what you're making in Colorado. In my experience people work at a slower speed here. We miss some of the amenities of the front range. Good Mexican food is harder to find, good Chinese food is harder to find, there are no real casinos, only one home Depot only one Lowe's so if they don't have it you have to wait for them to get it. Some  positives are you will not have any trouble finding friendly and nice people here. There are a number of good breweries here.

"Billings is a fine place. I think it’s a pretty standard Midwest town of its size. The usual pros and cons of an industrial town of 150k ppl (has plenty of restaurants/breweries/whatnot, but nothing mind-blowing). There’s more crime than the other Montana towns, but I’ve never felt unsafe downtown or had a car broken into or anything like that.

There’s not NEARLY as many ppl as Colorado, so the traffic isn’t even comparable (I’m comparing to Boulder/Denver). If you live in town your commute likely won’t be more than 20 minutes.

And the people are friendly, but don’t be surprised if you get some jeers for being from Colorado; the way you feel about Californians is how lots of Montanans feel about Coloradans (as well as Californians and Texans).

Billings isn’t as scenic or recreation-rich as western Montana, but it’s not like it’s the middle of nowhere. Red Lodge/Beartooth Mtns/Yellowstone are all pretty close, I’ve been told the Pryor Mtns are a hidden gem (I intend to explore them some this next year), and there are lots of places to explore if you’re willing to travel 2+ hours to the Crazy Mtns, Big Snowy Mtns, etc.

And the housing market is very reasonable compared to the other Montana towns. It’s one of the main reasons my wife and I moved here from Missoula a couple years back.

TL,DR: it’s a good town, just not as desirable as some other big towns here. But that also makes it a lot more affordable to have a good quality of life here.",t2_16d25a,KaseyOfTheWoods,0,1642798945.0,0,t1_htnf5fm,htnf5fm,True,Drama_in,t3_s9jlup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/s9jlup/is_billings_a_good_place_for_a_family_to_live/,Is Billings a good place for a family to live?,/r/Billings/comments/s9jlup/is_billings_a_good_place_for_a_family_to_live/htnf5fm/,20,r/Billings,0,20

"I lived in Billings as a 20 year old but it seemed like a great place to raise a family. It's quiet and there's lots of access to outdoor activities you could do with your family that are for free. I don't know how the local schools are, but Montana does have pretty good public universities if your children ended up taking that route. It is apparently one of the most dangerous cities in America, but I never found any issues. It might depend on neighborhood. Drunk driving rates are really high though so I would personally be worried about that if I had children. It's also by far the only real city in Montana so it comes with the comfort and amenities of a high population area like entertainment, shopping and health care.

"If you can find an open position in their website and can handle at the bare minimum probably 10 hour work days / 6 days a week shifts while doing a decent amount of physical labor (mainly mailhandlers/carriers though) , the USPS distribution center on S 26th St is a pretty good paying place that doesn't require any formal education. Hourly wages vary by craft, but i believe the lowest is around $17.50 an hour.

Got it appraised recently and the house is now worth $495,000.  3 years and 25% is quite the jump.  I also laugh at people who say its a housing bubble and don't know what that is.  The housing across the country has seen leaps due to simple supply and demand.  It will be years and years before we see the market stabilize from meeting demand and even then it won't crash but plateau.  People think that the 2008 housing bubble will happen again, except that was inflated by illegal lending practices that forced millions of homes into foreclosure due to bad balloon loans and variable interest loans, which are a hell of a lot harder to get into now.

"You guys might like it. There is a fairly strong MN connection, which tells me it's at least tolerable to a Minnesotan. Obviously a different world compared to NC. As everyone mentioned, it's not the mountains. I know the mountains are accessible enough to some people but it annoys me how far away they are. To me it's such an average city. Maybe that's right for some people. I try really hard to practice positivity, but I don't like it here. I don't like what people do for fun, I don't like the scenery, I don't like the attitude, I don't like the wages, I think opportunity is more limited than other areas, I think the standards are low on a lot of things, the list goes on. I've lived in towns and cities I like a lot more. For all the people that say to move, I can't. It's not because of money, just understand that I can't and it kind of kills me sometimes.

"Best way to find out if you like it is to come visit, and it sounds like you’re planning to! My wife and I really enjoy living in Billings. We love beer and good drinks, and we certainly have that here. There’s a walkable brewery tour through downtown called the Billings Brew Trail, you can find information about it online. A couple of the stops (especially UberBrew) have some really great food as well. And for good cocktails, Doc Harper’s Tavern is a martini bar downtown with some of the best drinks in the city. 
As for nature, Billings has great access to it. Zimmerman Park, Phipps Park and Four Dances Recreation Area are a few of my favorite places close to town. 
And if you’re able to make the trip to Red Lodge while you’re here, it’s beautiful around that area. 

Billings is a good mix between small town and big city. I’m from a very small town, so Billings is huge to me! But really, it’s not that big. It does have some bigger city amenities that many other places in the state do not have, and coming from a very small town, it’s certainly nice to have so much close by. 
We also have things that come along with having a larger population, like drugs and crime. Can’t really escape it anywhere these days. It’s certainly not like it is in actual big cities though. I’ve never had an issue with crime here and neither has my family, my best advice is just don’t come to Montana thinking you’re escaping the rest of the world. Especially in the really touristy areas of the state, some people take advantage of that. 

Housing here is a real issue right now, which is good to know before making any snap decisions about moving. Billings was ranked the #1 hottest real estate market in the country this summer - lots of people moving here, rapidly increasing housing prices, and very low availability. Good news though - Billings is still more affordable than some areas of the state. My wife and I were actually able to buy a house here this summer, so it is possible!

I hope you’re able to find what you’re looking for here, and welcome to Billings!",t2_2pduyoxc,BZNUber,0,1639636822.0,0,t1_hor2861,hor2861,True,astrorising,t3_rhg20u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/rhg20u/would_my_husband_and_i_be_a_good_fit_for_billings/,would my husband and i be a good fit for billings?,/r/Billings/comments/rhg20u/would_my_husband_and_i_be_a_good_fit_for_billings/hor2861/,2,r/Billings,0,2
"Billings is town chock full of lovely people. Billings also has the 19th highest violent crime per population in the nation. There are ups and downs of Billings and I’ve lived here my whole life. There is plenty of things to love about it, and many to not. Out of town city’s like Lockwood, Klein, Missoula, Lola, and smaller ones may have less big city amenities but are also within driving distance of Billings. From my experience the smaller the town the more communal the experience if you seek it. The Billings heights is growing rapidly and a lovely place. Billings itself is lovely and beautiful, but so is Montana. In my opinion Missoula is very welcoming and beautiful as well with less crime and drugs. Minus Mary J of course. Them missoulans blaze it up. Red lodge is wonderful too. Don’t get me wrong I love my home town but sometimes the toxicity and sadness seems like it may be higher here. I haven’t lived anywhere but have traveled alot.

"Just to give you an idea of current events, legalization passed the vote, but because of the votes related to allowing recreational businesses in city limits, and the “safety mill levy” vote they want to try and check the legalization vote again. They’re really reaching, but it’s very much feeling like they’re not happy with how the votes went, and are wanting a do-over. Though as far as I’m aware, the legalization isn’t in jeopardy, just the availability.

"Billings is a nice compromise between a big city and small town.  Like I alluded to, it’s not without it’s problems - a drug and bit of related crime problem, not that bad but could be better.  I never feel unsafe except maybe in a few parts of town at night.  Traffic is not at all bad.  I live in the center of the city and can get anywhere in 15-20 minutes max.

"Honestly the way things are going, I’d be wary of the recreational stuff. They’re trying really hard to quash the vote for it. As for the mountains, as others have said, we’re not exactly in the mountains, but there is a lot of ground nearby. Again as others have said, if you’re familiar with MN winters, you can handle it here. My wife went to college in MN and isn’t fazed by what we’re dealing with. 

There are some good local places to eat depending on what you’re into, and a pretty decent selection of good food types and beers and one interesting distillery (Asylum).

"The Beartooth Range, the highest mountains in the state, are an hour away although to really get into them it’s another 20-30 minutes.  There are plenty of outdoor opportunities both within the city and a few minutes outside of it.  If you’ve lived in MN you’ll probably find our winters relatively mild.  It does get cold but warms up relatively frequently and it’s the not the bone chilling damp cold of the upper Midwest. Summers can be quite hot but, again, there’s little or no humidity so they are more bearable.

While we’re not really a big city, we do have a fairly good bar and restaurant scene but it ain’t no Raleigh or Charlotte. Unless you’re really tied to the big city life, I think you’ll find the city to you’re liking. People are generally friendly and outdoor activities are everywhere. While housing costs are definitely on the rise, it’s nowhere as expensive as some parts of the state and it has a strong, viable and diverse economy.  Politically, it leans to the right but so does the whole star.  Billings is gradually, I feel, becoming more progressive all the time. It may not be perfect but it’s still a good place to live.

A landlord can charge a deposit and they can make deductions at the end of lease as long as they provide an itemized deduction sheet with invoices but they cannot just charge you $500 for a pet and keep it

Please be aware of your rights with the current market

[From this website](https://theburbz.com/laws/montana-landlord-tenant-laws/)

Nonrefundable fees: 
Not allowed.  Any fees or charges for cleaning and damages, no matter how designated, is presumed to be a security deposit.  (Mont. Ann. Code §§70-25-101(4))
 
 
Pet Deposits and Additional Fees:
Pet deposits are subject to the same rules and regulations of security deposits.  Pet deposits are not allowed to be non-refundable, but landlords are allowed to charge higher rent amount due to pets.  (Montana Landlord Tenant Guide, page 15)

"We're a bit limited when it comes to indie venues, or any venue for that matter.

 Kirk's Groceries has shows occasionally, very small and intimate last time I went in. Sporadic quality of artists, but a nice vibe and great people. 

The Garage has local music at least once or twice a month, bigger venue that serves as a brewery when there isn't a show. A large variety of artists, but I think its the best opportunity to hear local bands. This is my preferred venue, they have good beer and I like the bartenders. The audio quality is lacking at both venues, but they have alcohol to help forget about that. 

The Pub Station isn't really indie, it can house around a thousand and the tickets aren't dirt cheap unless if it's local, which is still a maybe. Still can get a variety of acts in, some are small local acts with only 25 people in the audience, others like Theory of a Deadman on Sunday, which is sold out. 

Unfortunately there isn't an immense music scene in Billings, it's either local shows or it serves as a stop for larger acts to get gas money. No matter what, you're gonna be getting a lot of country and folk

Edit: As I'm sure you've noticed, there's a bit of an attitude around here towards people from out of state. It's something I wouldn't volunteer too much. Nothing bad will happen, I don't think, but there may be an attitude shift if someone found out. A bit xenophobic, but admittedly housing and the roads have been a nightmare for locals since COVID started.

"Hi everyone! I’ve been seeing this a lot recently and I wanted to make sure everyone is aware that this is a predatory and illegal practice! Montana law states (MCA 70-25-201) “non-refundable deposits are not allowed under Montana law”

A landlord can charge a deposit and they can make deductions at the end of lease as long as they provide an itemized deduction sheet with invoices but they cannot just charge you $500 for a pet and keep it

Please be aware of your rights with the current market",t2_2l5h0ssm,fitnessthrowawayy15,0,1639188933.0,0,t1_ho2hq7j,ho2hq7j,True,[deleted],t3_rdp14o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/rdp14o/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Billings/comments/rdp14o/deleted_by_user/ho2hq7j/,1,r/Billings,0,1

"Try the far west end of the island, right down by the river.  You also have a good view of the mountains from the bridge across the river although car lights may interfere.

Another place that comes to mind is the top of the hills on the Molt Road west of town.",t2_bmqlb,hikerjer,0,1639100523.0,0,t1_hnxi5bo,hnxi5bo,False,ndmtpa,t3_rc5lb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Billings/comments/rc5lb7/is_there_a_good_place_thats_within_1020_minutes/,Is there a good place that’s within 10-20 minutes from Billings to be able to catch the sunset behind the Beartooths?
