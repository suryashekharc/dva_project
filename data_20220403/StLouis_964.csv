"Wow. I've read all of the comments thus far... AND....making fun drinks/creating/stirring and shaking is only about 10% of what we actually do as bartenders, the rest is wiping down tables, writing orders, cleaning puke, smiling when people are dicks, taking 5 minutes to make a fucking hot tea when you have 30 other things that need to get done including grabbing ranch for tbl 12...
 
Because YOU WILL BE A SERVER. AND A FOOD RUNNER. AND A BUSSER. AND A HOST. 

Bartenders are like the top of the FOH pyramid. Which means that they've had to conquer all of the other aspects of the FOH and in a lot of cases BOH too...

The only places that would hire you based on your apparent refusal to ""wipe down tables"" and ""take orders"" with no other experience would require you to have a body and face attractive enough to get hired by some creepy old owner who has creepy old man patrons. Hope you like getting told to smile. 

Good luck.

Edit: if you really think your up to snuff go to platypus and see if they'll bring you on. The owners have publicly stated that they want to use their bar to train up the next generations of bartenders and industry professionals.

"Coach K is Mike Krzyzewski, one of the greatest college basketball coaches of all time. This year was his 47th and final season coaching Duke. North Carolina and Duke have one of the most, if not the most, heated rivalries in all sports. 

Duke was, on paper, the clear better team this year with a real shot to win a National Championship in Coach K‚Äôs final year. But instead they lost to their most hated rivals in the semifinal game, so K‚Äôs career is over and their rivals play for the title on Monday. Adding salt to the wound‚ÄîUNC also upset Duke in the final game of the regular season, Coach K‚Äôs last home game. Also, giving additional hype to this game was the fact that in their multi-decades long rivalry, this was the very first time UNC and Duke had ever met in the NCAA tournament.

"100% must: the city museum

Grew up in St. Louis and moved away when I was 19, but I‚Äôve came back to visit quite a bit over the years. The city museum as a kid was the single greatest thing you could ever imagine. Basically a massive warehouse turned into one conjoint work of art, a series of sculptures and activities that you have at your free reign. The games of hide and seek there were second to none.

Fast forward to age 23, I‚Äôm back home with some friends and one of them has the idea to go to the city museum just for fun. Why not. We made sure to go later so there would be less kids, and there was. Actually, there was mostly young adults. There‚Äôs several bars and cafes that serve beer and bar food, and we immediately realized why our parents never minded taking us here. 

My experience going there as a young adult not only gave me a strong sense of nostalgia, but it was also incredibly fun! We got quite drunk, made friends, and had a blast just like when we were kids. The city museum is truly (IMO) the best attraction in St. Louis. 

The dude who created it actually tried to create another project, similar, but more directly focused on adults trying to have a good time. To my knowledge his dedication led him to being killed in the process of creating it, in a tragic accident. Bottom line though, he had people of ALL ages in mind when creating the city museum, and you owe it to yourself to see it when you‚Äôre in St. Louis.",t2_8klafhe,jakityjake,0,1648989742.0,0,t1_i37tuuw,i37tuuw,True,mydogisblack77,t3_tuxf0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/tuxf0h/what_fununiqueridiculous_things_are_there_to_do/,What fun/unique/ridiculous things are there to do in St Louis for a guy's trip?,/r/StLouis/comments/tuxf0h/what_fununiqueridiculous_things_are_there_to_do/i37tuuw/,1,r/StLouis,0,1

"While you may be confident in your ability to handle any of that, and I don't doubt that you can, it's not your assessment of your ability that matters. As a manager I can take a chance on someone with no experience, or I can hire someone with a track record.

Service industry is flooded with people who want bartending shifts and they tend to promote (I use the term loosely) from within. Assuming you have all of the best qualities of a bartender, but no relevant work history to show for it, why should a bar manager take a chance on you over someone with a work history in the industry. The previous comment mentions hosting, or serving because those are positions that are generally hiring. You have to get your foot in the door somehow, and both have unique skill sets that will help you behind the bar. For every bartender you see in a restaurant there are 4-5 servers and a host.

Not trying to be a dick, just trying to give you the perspective of someone who's been doing this a long time.

"Well, you bring up some valid points. But! how will I learn to bartend without ever getting a job that does it? Being a hostess won‚Äôt give me bartending skills/it won‚Äôt provide the experience on a resume a lot of places look for. I think a lot of skills as being a nurse will translate over, at least intrapersonal skills and multitasking. 


I also am not doing it for the money, I am going to be taking off from working as a nurse for a few months and just want to have something I can spend my time on and doing something I enjoy.

"Which turtle race? Big Joe‚Äôs? Had my second date with my wife and now mother to my first child there 7 years ago. Bought a pitcher for extra tickets, she didn‚Äôt really like beer, I drank most of it, and the rest was history. 

As an StL native, if you want to get weird on a dudes trip in August, I‚Äôm guessing one night you‚Äôll probably keep it local to Busch and do Ballpark Village and the like around the night of the game. Anyone feeling adventurous and frisky can take the trip to the East Side for strip clubs if they so choose. It‚Äôs not as bad as you think (it‚Äôs arguably the focal point for strippers in the region) but the area is certainly not one you would walk around in. Don‚Äôt have high expectations for downtown (unfortunately). Not much a local scene‚Ä¶maybe one day. 

On the other two nights‚Ä¶if you could manage a night at the City Museum when it‚Äôs an adult night, that‚Äôs legit. Place is legendary.

If there are good shows at Pageant/Delmar Hall, get drinks at Moonrise, see a show, then drink at Pinup. If y‚Äôall like pitchers, darts, memorabilia, and burgers‚Ä¶spend an afternoon or evening at Blueberry Hill. Then see a show. Then go to Pinup. Or just skip the show and do BBH and PinUp.

If anyone has access to LSD or Shrooms‚Ä¶take a day in Forest Park. Place is huge, and the Zoo and Art Museum are free. You don‚Äôt need drugs to have fun, but it wouldn‚Äôt make it less fun. Forest Park is easily one of the best urban parks in the country. Hell, y‚Äôall wanna golf? They got that too. Don‚Äôt sleep on Tower Grove or the Botanical Garden either. 

You can buy weed across the river if you‚Äôre wanting a dispensary. Won‚Äôt be cheap, but it‚Äôs legal, and there‚Äôs no chance in hell that STLPD gives a shit or has the resources to care about it.

And if y‚Äôall like beer‚Ä¶hard to go wrong with breweries. 4Hands, Perennial, and Urban Chestnut to name a few. Even the free AB tour‚Ä¶place is cool. Or any dive bar in the city. Venice Cafe is one of the most unique bars you‚Äôll find. 

If you want to experience the majesty that is the Mississippi River with nobody else around, go to the Chain of Rocks bridge. It‚Äôs a unique experience.

Like graffiti and rust belt decay? Check out the graffiti on the Floodwall. Paint Louis is an annual event that changes that shit up every year. 

Food? BBQ‚Ä¶but you knew that already. Get Blues City Deli, a beer, and eat outside while admiring the red brick in the neighborhood. Seriously. 

Disclaimer: Haven‚Äôt lived in the city in 10 years, but have been back a lot (pre-pandemic). Hopefully what I said is still true, and better to boot.

">Proper storage is part of the unlawful use of a weapon statute, which is the charge you can face with a loaded gun in Illinois and no permit.

Once again, did you read any of the stuff I linked? Let's try again. Read the [Illinois State Police Law Bulletin - August 2018](https://www.usconcealedcarry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Constitutional_Carry_August_2018.pdf):

>Pursuant to the Illinois Firearm Concealed Carry Act, 430 ILCS 66/1 et seq., certain persons may keep or carry a loaded or unloaded concealed firearm on or about their persons or within a vehicle. The provisions of this Act regarding carrying on or about a person apply only to licensees; however, the provisions regarding carrying within a vehicle have broader implications

Got that? Moving on:

>Question:
>
>Can out of state residents carry a loaded and uncased firearm in their vehicle as they travel through Illinois?
>
>Response:
>
>Within a vehicle ‚Äì Out of state residents can carry a concealed firearm in their vehicles as they travel through Illinois so long as they meet the provisions of ¬ß40(e) of the Act.

Continuing:

>What is required by ¬ß40(e)?
>
>they must not be prohibited under federal law;
>they must be eligible to carry in their state of residence; and
>they must be in possession of the license or permit issued by their state, *if applicable*.

Still with me? Now, under 'Further Guidance':

>Residents of states, who allow unlicensed carry in any form (see column 1 and 2 above), *are not required to produce a license or permit for purposes of ¬ß40(e)*.

Ponder that for a bit.

>It happens all of the time

Got any proof?

>My advice remains the same as my initial comment, if you're going to come into Illinois with a gun, especially if you don't have a permit, 
have it broken down, unloaded, and properly stored.

"Too cheap to buy the Post, so I didn't read it.  If she wanted to do a distribute money to the poorest people kind of deal, I guess it wouldn't bother me so much.  My thing with slavery reparations is a) no former slaves are still alive.  Yes, I get that there is a legacy, etc., but it seems like a blatant identity politics play. and b) I have never heard anyone who supports reparations give a definite figure that would end the issue.  If one bill is passed, it will never be enough.  Maybe I'm wrong about that, but that's my feeling. 

A more effective way of addressing the legacy of slavery, IMO, would be addressing poverty issues.  But that would involve some uncomfortable discussions, and it's easier to pander to the victim crowd.  Yeah, slavery is one of the horrible things our country has done and real former slaves never got their 40 acres and a mule, but this doesnt feel like a solution.",t2_yzpza,fuckkroenkeanddemoff,0,1648943868.0,0,t1_i361kbz,i361kbz,False,Educational_Skill736,t3_tu419y,https://www.reddit.com/r/StLouis/comments/tu419y/st_louis_mayor_signs_bill_allowing_voluntary/,St. Louis mayor signs bill allowing voluntary reparations donations as ‚Äòfirst step‚Äô,/r/StLouis/comments/tu419y/st_louis_mayor_signs_bill_allowing_voluntary/i361kbz/,1,r/StLouis,0,1

"Perhaps. But what actually strikes me as ludicrous about the ""they had good grades in HS and were in all the clubz hur dur"" comment is, while perhaps true, how does that translate to being qualified to prosecute and judge criminal case law for an entire county? They have/had law degrees and a license. Fabulous. So does every two-bit ambulance chaser AND anyone who graduated at the bottom of their law school class. (Just like doctors who barely pass are still called MDs, ffs.) They'd both had minimal lawyering experience, in an unrelated field of law, before deciding to thrust themselves into high-profile positions that gave them power over the futures and very *lives* of people in their darkest, most desperate hours. Cases where, if you don't know what you're doing and fuck up, can have reverberating consequences not just for families for generations, but entire communities. As we've seen.

"I've been to both Old Town's and there is a similarity in their chocolate icings but the filled donuts at Helfer's are a different style than Old Town serves. They are flatter and more disc shaped while Old Town has a traditional Bavarian Bismarck with a taller, fatter shape. Helfer's is also are right in between their two times a year they sell Paczki which are more similar to the filled donuts they are selling when I went. It could be a mix of both - I'll have to do more investigating when I go back in for an Apple Fritter which they only have on Friday's. They didn't seem all that interested in any questions when I went in, though (which is normal for some shops). The owner came out and I told him I was recording for a YouTube channel called the STL Donut Tour and was showcasing local donut shops and he just waved and said, ""okay"" then went back to the back of house.

"No methodology is perfect. For example, the actual Capital One Cup triples the value of the ""more popular"" sports and I just stuck with that. It does allow smaller schools to compete since they may not participate in certain sports.

One thing that balances that small private schools vs large private and public schools is the lack of teams in certain sports. In Lutheran St. Charles case, they partner with other schools for swimming and wrestling (I just learned that). Can't get points when partnered. Lutheran South doesn't have boys swimming or any wrestling teams.

Also, it seems like there are less teams if the biggest class of certain sports, making it easier for larger schools to get to a quarterfinal in a playoff bracket and get some points.

Looking at the multi-year aggregate sheets, large private and public schools tend have the most points over the recent years. CBC and Rockhurst for the boys. Incarnate Word and St. Joseph's for the girls. Big public school Rock Bridge in Columbia being dominant overall.

Other ways of looking at the data would be compare rivals schools' performance or look at what schools are dominating certain sports over the years.

"I think your edited thoughts probably had a certain effect on the case. I know he stood out. Lincoln County very often has an insular mindset.

I know one person who saw that case‚Äôs handling and got out as fast as he could and now he‚Äôs back doing some work to fix it. He plays a certain persona and they eat it up in Lincoln County, even though he‚Äôs not even from Missouri. They like him because he plays rural and simple and he is pretty country but they have no idea how most of his behavior is an act, they‚Äôre all swayed by his accent.

"I‚Äôm pretty picky with it to be fair. I almost entirely drive by fiddling with the speed/follow distance/disable-enable settings, but it‚Äôs pretty responsive to throttle and brake. 

What I hate is when it
1.	thinks road spray, dust, or exhaust smoke is an dangerous obstacle and engages PCAS, beeps, vibrates, and emergency brakes 
2.	unexpectedly PCASs when I‚Äôm quickly approaching (but not uncontrollably or unawarely) a slower car ahead
3.	is in radar cruise and I‚Äôm approaching a stopped car far ahead, I expect Eyesight to lock on to it and gradually slow down, but‚Ä¶.it doesn‚Äôt. So then I expect PCAS, but‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt. It really doesn‚Äôt. Like *hello are you going to stop or just hit this car HELLO* then I have to step on the brakes. I‚Äôve seen videos of people testing it with cardboard cutouts of cars, and it‚Äôs tragically shitty at stopping for high-speed (>35mph) rear-enders. (It‚Äôs cruise system does stop comfortably or engages PCAS if it is actively tracking the car ahead, like in traffic jams or dense stroad traffic, but if there isn‚Äôt a track, it‚Äôs as if nothing‚Äôs there.) 
4.	does a shitty job of lane keeping/centering. It just bounces between the lines if you minimally steer it, if thag, and complains and beeps to say it can‚Äôt see the lines (because this is St Louis‚Ä¶who needs high-contrast road markings, especially in the rain?) 
5.	beeps all the fucking time (my wife hates it). Beep for lock on. Beep for lock lost. Beep for when it detects an unsignaled lane change. Beep of the car in front of you moved ahead (green light reminder). Loud beeps and violent vibrations when it randomly decides to PCAS itself. (Though it‚Äôs saved us from a few almost-rearenders. 
6.	Tbh I wish it had a fast approaching rear-traffic warning sensor/beep, because deciding to make a lane change when a yet-unbeknownst-to-you asshat behind you is doing 120mph and takes a line through the lane you‚Äôre merging into with other traffic is some bullshit.

"From Time Magazine, back in 1958, comes a short story about  a sizable divorce settlement involving the Bettendorfs.

>Into St. Louis County circuit court came Florence Toft Bettendorf, 47, charging desertion against her husband, Supermarketeer Joseph Bettendorf, 51. until lately the proprietor of nine big St. Louis markets. Out went Mrs. Bettendorf wheeling a shopping cart full of money: $1,175,000 in a divorce settlement, plus $12,000 a year for the Bettendorfs' four children.  
>  
>Joe Bettendorf could afford the bite. Starting with a single market and a $5,000 loan in 1929, he had expanded to two high-quality stores by 1945, kept on growing with the city until last year's sales totaled $33 million, with profits of $600,000. Early this year he decided to rest, and sold out to the Midwestern ACF-Wrigley Stores, Inc. Price: $8,540,000 in stock and cash, which still leaves him a nice little grubstake, Mrs. Bettendorf or no.
