The set list for March 21 is worth framing itself!  Not quite two full concerts worth of incredible music in one night, but damn close.  Sadly among the earliest shows following ‘Pens passing, but what a tribute to his legacy!

Alas no, didn’t make these shows.  I was 13 then and not yet on the bus.  And by the time of The Dead’s second and last appearance in Utica in 1979, I was a thousand miles away in college.  But noteworthy that the 1973 and 1979 shows were among the first and last with Keith and Donna Godchaux.

"Wow you’re getting some real crazy Utica loving advice here.  I don’t know what your income is or what sorts of situations you’re used to.  I’m going to throw out the whole idea that you might want to be within walking distance of anything, because good luck with that in the winter; sidewalks are typically not cleared entirely.  If you’re set on living in Utica you need to be south of Burrstone Road/The Memorial Parkway.  North Utica is perfectly fine, but there aren’t many apartments.  West Utica is simply awful.  There was a time where if you lived far enough East of Mohawk Street in East Utica, it wasn’t so bad.  That time has passed.  Anything North of Burrstone on either side is no good.  I moved out of South Utica recently.  There was a shooting on my street in broad daylight.  Someone was recently murdered in a separate incident at the Fastrac on Genesee street, south of Burrstone, in broad daylight.  I was speaking with a an attorney who lives on Proctor Blvd. I told him “that’s gotta be the nicest street in Utica.”  It sincerely is a beautiful street, lots of nice houses, very close to St. Elizabeth’s.  His response was “yeah nicest street in Utica, my car’s been broken into three time since I moved in.”  

Here’s every area I’d move to before Utica unless the woes of urban life in a city that is somehow on a downturn are: New York Mills and New Hartford are the closest, Clinton is a little further away (literally minutes further away) but it’s a college town with everything you need inside the town.  Whitesboro, is adjacent to Utica, but it may be inexplicably expensive as there’s nothing special about that town.  There are apartments in Deerfield and especially Marcy, but that’s a bit more out there.

If I was you I’d look at New York Mills.  It’s adjacent to Utica, there are many rentals units, and tends to not be very expensive.  New Hartford is fine, but I feel like a lot of what you end up paying for is the school district (which is an awesome school district), but unless you have kids what’s the point?  Clinton is a very nice town, just a bit up the road, maybe fifteen minutes from St. E’s, but you’re living in a college town.

I spent over twenty years of my life living in Utica.  I moved to Barneveld a few months ago.  Almost all of my friends still live in Utica.  I miss living closer to them, but an 18 minute drive to see them is less of a hassle than living there.  Except North Utica, but that’s not really Utica.

I hate when the right lane person thinks they can just drive into my lane too though and I should cross the line into oncoming traffic.

Alternatively, I believe little Roma’s chicken riggies are a little on the cheesier side, but I’ve only had them once and that was a while ago. From what I can remember I quite enjoyed them.

"You're better off at Utica College, SUNY Poly sukcs assss. The college professors are self centered jerks who just show up and collect their 6 figures. 

I had one professor Dr.Jorge Novillo who is like 80 years old and spent an entire week trying to figure out the projector and didn't teach a thing. He had us watch some video of him teaching from 2010 when he got lazy and most kids either failed or dropped because he was so bad. Same with Roger Cavallo. He gave us an old book from the 80s of poorly hand written notes and just insulted every student in class rather than helping them. 

When me and my friend transferred to Utica College it was WAY better. 

Suny Poly has like no girls either. So unless you're gay good luck getting laid. 

Utica was so much better, and the teachers were extremely helpful and nice. Library was awesome to.  Food was way better and the Campus wasn't so isolated either. Plus, Suny poly janitors suck. Unlike at Utica College, Suny Poly Janitors work during the day so while you're trying to study you have some moron pushing a cart through the library from 9pm to 5pm. At least all other colleges have them work nights or early mornings.  

Plus, Suny poly had horrible AC. Hot in the summer cold in the winter. And the lighting was horrible! They kept the place way too dark. 

I felt like a bat in a cave up there. 

Campus police sucked asss too. Like one time I took a break from studying and bought some food and was eating it in the parking lot before I went back in to study. This cop pulled up next to me like I was doing heroine or something.  I was SO mad and just wanted to be left alone. I actually picked up the steak i was eating with my bare hands and started eating it like a caveman. Eventually the dumb guy got the message and bothered someone else.

Utica Coffee is nice to hang too but it doesn't have as 'social' a vibe to me. Most people who hang out there are either in groups/pairs or into a book/laptop. I've gone there for years and could probably count the number of times I have had a conversation more substantive than small talk.

""Domenico's"" ($) (in South Utica) Artsy vibe, they DO allow dogs last time I was there, but this may have changed (just keep them off the old furniture lol). very casual and affordable. Last time I checked they only accept cash, but they have an ATM. You'll meet some really interesting people there. It's my favorite for hanging out and socializing.
(If you like beer, There's also a dog-friendly pub directly across the street owned by the same family, ""Green Onion Pub."")

""Character Coffee"" ($$) Clean, straight forward cafe, feels a little bit classier than the previous two. The barista seem really friendly and skilled. Great coffee, and last time I was there I tried the matcha green tea, it was great! Not sure about dogs.

""Joe Putrello's"" ($$$) VERY classy, they serve gourmet coffee and have professional baristas. Go here for a modern European atmosphere, but you'll be paying a bit more. It's in a beautiful modern building across from the Stanley Theater. It's in the same building as ""Nostro"" restaurant. Probably NOT dog friendly, but I could be wrong.

I'm sure there are a few quicker ""to-go"" coffee spots I'm missing...

Competition only makes if all the important parameters (cost, quality, etc.) are as transparent as possible. Naturally we have nothing like this and so people are getting fleeced.

As far as buying it from a store, it is not currently legal. There are a lot of sticker stores and reservation stores out there. Join a local FB group for cannabis growing/smoking and you’ll find all the info you want. Someone can “gift” you cannabis, you cannot purchase though “legally”.

They have not legalized growing for anyone yet, let alone the medical card holders like myself. However; we do expect that to change in the coming couple months. 

My advice to you is learn how to grow your own, purchase some seeds from a reputable seed bank, and set up a grow tent in your home.  Grow a greener thumb and enjoy the learning process.  Your own homegrown is going to be 1000 times better than what you can purchase from a store.

The general consensus is 3 mature plants and 3 immature per adult in the household, will be what is passed. When the medical cardholders start growing you should expect to have to wait around 18 months from that date for non medical card holders to start growing legally.",t2_j8xupak0,Benjammin_onthefarm,0,1646661197.0,0,t1_hzpbjqa,hzpbjqa,True,Pornaccount9249,t3_t84033,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utica/comments/t84033/uticanew_york_marijuana_laws/,Utica/New York Marijuana laws?,/r/Utica/comments/t84033/uticanew_york_marijuana_laws/hzpbjqa/,1,r/Utica,0,1

"I respect your privacy regarding specifics.  I could name dozens of regions across the USA preferable to live, with lower taxes and better everything else; however, your move is driven not only by your husband's career but also your commitment to find the best place for your family's happiness and prosperity.

It's true that older cities have dated homes, but newer construction is what I had in mind with my earlier post ... homes in the suburbs with dishwashers and other modern amenities.  A few areas around Rome that you may like to explore are Lake Delta, Lee Center, Ridgewood Heights, Tamarack, Potter Rd, North George, Gifford Rd.  Homes built in the 1990s to the present exist, as well as many from the 1960s-80s completely renovated.  

Your search may take longer than you planned, but hopefully you can afford to pursue every option within a wide area surrounding Oneida.  When watching HGTV's *House Hunters*, I've often wished the hunters would keep on looking and not settle for less than their dreams.  Of course, reality being what it is, you'll most likely have to compromise to a degree.  Year by year, transform the house you choose into a dream home.

"Thanks for the response- we are moving from a Midwest state but I don’t want to give too many specifics.

Areas  I grew up and have lived since then have newer 1500sq ft+ and 3-4 bedroom houses for the 150-200’s easily. Since looking in NY everything is from the 1800’s to 1960’s, small, in a flood plain and many don’t even have a dishwasher! That’s bananas to me. And they still cost the same as the bigger, newer houses I’m used to seeing. Plus the NY taxes are killer so we have to really drop our potential monthly mortgage range to compensate for the high monthly taxes.

"Areas throughout Oneida, Madison, and Herkimer counties are comparatively affordable depending on where you're moving from.  Homes (3 to 4 bedroom) with large yards are anywhere from 1/4 to 1/3 the cost of those in different states.  For example, a 600-700k suburban home in NJ would go for 140-180k here in 2022.  Just 5 years ago, the price range was more like 90-120k for similar homes.  It would be most helpful if you provided more information on your current location/state.  Calling upstate/central NY ""crazy expensive"" is seldom heard.  Thousands of families living closer to NYC and from other states looking to relocate have considered this region as an economic godsend ... a great place to raise their families and live comfortably while building their savings for the future.

This area is home to many excellent school districts, colleges, and universities.  Keep on searching neighborhoods in and near New Hartford, Whitesboro, Sherrill, Rome, Holland Patent, Adirondack Central, Westmoreland.  The commute from Rome to the southern part of Oneida really is not too far.  Once you settle in, you'll find that driving from town to town through the countryside for dining, shopping, entertainment, civic endeavors, outdoors recreation, cultural enrichment, or any reason whatsoever becomes a pleasure.

"My other favorite place is Pho Mekong House of Noodles. It's not a date place for sure and it's geared for take out, although you can eat in too.   
Now - don't confuse  this with Chinese Food, it's nothing like it and in my opinion far superior in ingredients and taste.  
My go to meal is #S43 on the menu: PhoXao-Pad Thai with chicken, rice noodles, scallions, bean sprouts, peanuts, egg and some type of a mile rice vinegar with some other seasoning. This stuff is delicious.  The chicken is cooked perfectly, moist and it's chicken breast - not the crap you find in most Chinese Food. Instead of chicken you can get pork, beef, scrimp or seafood. 

I also get menu # A8 appetizer which is small whole shrimp grilled with pineapple.

I always intend on working my way around the menu, but end up getting #S43 over and over so far.

"We go mid-afternoon because the place is always pretty busy otherwise. If you're not into pie, grab a cupcake and take it home from Lizzy's in that same hallway. They are flavor-packed and always moist. fresh spinach with homemade herb mayonnaise. Amazing taste.

Kind of a secret location. It's like the bat cave. If you don't know it's there you will drive right by it. It's in New Hartford Shopping Center - in what they call the center court. It's really a walkway/hallway with a few businesses in there.

On the top of my list from the menu is a menu item named the LINCOLN CENTER, \*but\* I order it open face on Sour Dough Bread - it's slices of thin roasted turkey with spinach. melted swiss cheese and fresh spinach with home made herb mayonnaise. Amazing taste.

If your lucky enough to catch the pot roast special - it's pretty intense in flavor - it sells out fast.

Also the lasagna is like eating at your grandma's. But they don't have it everyday.

If you can - grab a slice of 100% homemade pie - try the coconut cream,  if you are too full - take it home.

Be prepared to wait a few minutes for your food - it's all made per order - fresh and hot. The fish fry or fish sandwich is also on our frequent list.

Great atmosphere - NYC tickets, posters and flyers all over the place with nice jazz piped in.

"I moved from my place south of Burrstone a few months ago.  This area is traditionally considered to be South Utica.  There was a shooting on my street, Symonds Place, on a Sunday afternoon.  Just someone pulled up in a car and started shooting into a house.  No idea what it was about.  Someone was murdered in broad day light a couple weeks ago at Fastrac on Genesee Street.  Utica has gone down hill so much in recent years.  I’m a fairly big guy and used to go for walks late at night by myself as a way to wind down after work.  I would not do that today.

Some people have mentioned south of Proctor Blvd.  I was speaking with a guy I know professionally one time and he mentioned he lived on Proctor Blvd.  I said “man that’s got to be about the nicest street in the city.”  His response was “yeah the nicest street in the city, my cars been broken into four times since I moved there.  I’ve only been living there for two years.”  He went on to rant about how he couldn’t wait to get some land in Poland or Deerfield.  

Almost all of my friends still live in Utica.  I still hang out there.  There is no way on god’s green earth that I would want to raise a family there.  If you can’t find anything outside of Utica, check out North Utica.  It looks and feels a lot like the manors in New Hartford, but it’s the safest part of Utica.",t2_oomuows,ServingPapers,0,1646175042.0,0,t1_hyz2eqv,hyz2eqv,True,moriganrising,t3_t3fqv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utica/comments/t3fqv9/is_utica_safe/,Is Utica safe?,/r/Utica/comments/t3fqv9/is_utica_safe/hyz2eqv/,2,r/Utica,0,2

"Sure, but a little background for context. The Sauquoit creek has flooded many times in Whitesboro, as many people will tell you. However, in the last 10 or 12 years it has gotten much worse and much more frequent (source, me I live here and have experienced at least 4 major floods since 2011 and none in the previous decade before). We're talking floods caused by rain events, tropical and post tropical storms and even ice jams. Well, back on Halloween 2019 the village experienced another flood, this one probably the worst of all the previous floods.   
After each flood residents would call on officials to do something, most wanting buyouts from FEMA rather than continuing to repair and replace (I'm on my 4th or 5th furnace I lose track). FEMA never seemed interested in a buyout, but in the Fall of 2020 there was an announcement that the NRCS, National Resource Conservation Service, a part of the USDA had been authorize to provide a buyout program for residential properties in Whitesboro that have been damaged by repeat flood events. The targeted area included some 200 residential properties in the village of Whitesboro. Interested residents have submitted applications (I've heard as many as 190 owners have applied) and the process hopefully is in the home stretch. We were told 2 - 4 years for the process. All the applicants have had their homes appraised, and an environmental survey of each property has also been completed. I think the next step is receiving an offer with a purchase price. From there owners have 30 days to decide what they wish to do. One caveat from NRCS is that the offer made for your home must pay off the mortgage and any liens on the property as they want a title that is clear and clean. They've also alluded to, but haven't really confirmed, that blocks of homes is their goal as they want to return as much of this area back to natural flood plain with no structures.   
If everyone down here sold (they won't as many plan to stay no matter what) there would be many homes and properties torn away from the village (and town) tax rolls. There will also be a large number of residents looking for housing in an area where quality affordable housing is already in short supply.",t2_2sv8jw0f,goodfella1030,0,1646059547.0,0,t1_hys6qod,hys6qod,False,moriganrising,t3_t3fqv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utica/comments/t3fqv9/is_utica_safe/,Is Utica safe?,/r/Utica/comments/t3fqv9/is_utica_safe/hys6qod/,6,r/Utica,0,6

"Avoid houses in the Village of Whitesboro if they are east and north of the village green. The flood risk there is not worth it. Plus you will pay more in annual flood insurance than you will in taxes.  
Keep in mind that there is the potential for a large buyout of homes to happen in the village of Whitesboro that will possibly have giant ramifications on the village tax base.  


As specifically to your question about Utica... there are parts that are still safe and parts that are not very safe and places you probably should not live.

"Hello! I’ve lived in Utica and new Hartford my whole life (separated parents ) and I now live in south Utica on the border of new Hartford. I highly suggest this specific area if you can ! 

No location is 100% safe from stolen items (new Hartford cars and yards are often targets with the assumption of wealth in that town), but I’ve left my canoe in my open garage all summer and it was not taken. In the warm months I leave a lot out on our front porch and nothing was taken either. If someone’s mail (packages included ) is delivered to the wrong address you will get it back. My neighbors are very friendly and I am so happy with the location. 

Outside of south Utica (specifically close to the border of new Hartford ) I love the Deerfield area of north Utica. My sister lives there and my niece attends school in the whitesboro school district.

"My current knowledge tells me wafers are going out whole but this is something I am not entirely sure of.  The plans have changed over the last decade lol.  Odd thing is about these places...everyone knows the terminology for the general process of manufacturing but not any one person knows how each fab tool works entirely.  I think it's a compartmentalized construction process regardless of IF intentionally or not.  Same with Nuclear ANYTHING, bombs, turbines, subs.  And many other special manufacturing techniques.  We know what it does, but we don't know how it does it.  Some of the Japanese Tooling for the MVF has be wondering how did they KNOW it took each machine to create the final product.

"That's lot to answer but I can touch on key points.  The water is staggering.  Up to and probably more than a million gallons a day.  C02 is Carbon Dioxide, did you mean C0? The electricity is also quite abundant.  Up to 100 megawatt hours PER hour.  Enough to power small towns.  The only thing leaving the facility will be semiconductor wafers that will be stored for transport and shipped via large trucks.  There are several loading docks where trucks can back and be loaded manually.  Overall waste materials is minimal.  Everything is steam and boiler powered.  The lasers and complex machinery use a lot of power as do the HVAC system that pumps more air through the building than probably 25 walmarts do at the same rate.  This air flow keeps the pressure negative to keep particulates or dust out of the cleanroom and building altogether.  If you open certaim doors you get a blast of fresh air.

"I am from a modern city in the south where the sun shines and its actually beautiful at least once a week.  This town is dark, it's infrastructure crumbling and wholly the city seems to love to wallow in its self pity for the things it lacks or cannot adequately correct.  From a legal stand point I entirely get what the OP is stating albeit its from an emotionally charged stance.  But if you just stop and let your programmed NY state minds comprehend what he's really getting at it makes perfect sense.  

Briefly summed up:

""2 fast moving lanes of a main throughway constantly have converging right lane drivers entering theft lane without warning, repeatedly, by avoiding questionably parked cars blocking entire right hand lanes FORCING left lane drivers to make unnecessary, illegal and dangerous adjustments to avoid being side swiped including entering opposing head on traffic"" 

   The old heads of this city will gradually and nonchalantly just take up HALF of the open left lane and HALF of the Genesee St. right hand lane where people are parked.  This FORCES the left hand lane into on coming traffic or you risk being side swiped.  The right hand lane take ZERO CONSIDERATION for the legally and safely operating vehicles driving down the left lane.  The right hand mergers avoiding parked Genesee St vehicles not only expect you to move into oncoming traffic but they will look at you as if you're insane if you DON'T GET OUT OF THEIR WAY.  If I stay in my lane on the left and you can't merge safely or ""squeeze around parked cars while going 45 mph""  who's fault is it if you hit me or the parked car?  It's yours.  100% unequivocally YOURS.  Your sense of entitlement from driving down Genesee St your whole life or being a New Yorker with an attitude constitutes nothing for legally governed roadways.  Just a thought for those who don't seem to get it.  Stop taking 2 lanes and expecting us left handers to get into oncoming traffic.  I will add that half the time this happens to me the person taking half the left and right lane to avoid parked cars is generally someone who appears to look as though they believe they've conquered life while yours is a slum.  Nice vehicle, big glasses, Starbucks in hand and a tacky designer scarf.  Meanwhile you almost side swiped my winter purposed shitbox car where I just left my job consulting for Wolfspeed for 100 an hour.  Want to sideswipe a 2500 dollar car with your BMW X7?

"I don’t think that it’s an issue of redlining in this particular situation.  If you want an actual example of that I’d look at the West Hill School District out by Syracuse.  It’s shaped like an hour glass and basically encompasses nicer parts of the town of Onondaga and Fairmount while getting real skinny in the “Skunk City” part of Syracuse ( I didn’t come up with the name there’s a sign that says Skunk City in the 13204 zip code).  One of the biggest beneficiaries of Schuyler being in part (only in part it’s not the whole town by any means) in the Whitesboro school district  is a large, and not very nice trailer park.  The reason I personally find it odd is that Schuyler is not in the same county as Whitesboro.  Thats why it’s so unusual, it is adjacent to the Whitesboro school district, but in Herkimer County.

Want your kids to go to a better school?  Get an apartment in New Hartford.  If you don’t think you can afford New Hartford literally every other town that is not in Utica is a better option.   Every single town that is not in the city of Utica is a better option without exception.  Utica is not cheaper to live in than say Westmoreland, Waterville, Sauquoit,  Oriskany, Clark Mills, New York Mills, and the list goes on until you’re down to the last town in Oneida County.  I lived in Utica for most of my life and there was no way in hell that my daughter was going to attend school there.  The options to avoid her going to school there were many.  I moved out of Utica a few months ago to a small town, pay less rent, and wouldn’t move back to that shit hole on a bet.

"I don’t think there’s anything wrong with Schuyler.  It wouldn’t be my first choice, but that’s not to say it’s bad.  What’s your transportation situation?  Do you have kids?  If you have kids a huge benefit to Schuyler is a lot of it is actually in the Whitesboro School District.  I don’t know how this happened, it doesn’t make a ton of sense, but it’s a far better school district than Utica or Frankfort which are both closer to Schuyler.  If you’re looking to rent I can’t think of all that many options in Schuyler.  It’s a small town, it doesn’t have a post office, your mailing address will mostly likely be Utica 13502, and it’s in Herkimer County not Oneida County (which is actually amazing if you’re trying to obtain a pistol permit).  Regardless you will be able to get to all of the conveniences of Utica fairly quick from Schuyler using Route 5 or 5S.

"Point is, it's stupid to have legal parking spots in a place where any cars that park there take up half of a lane of moving traffic. 

That's just objectively true, whether you want to admit it or not, you know it is. Parked cars should not impede traffic. It's unsafe and raises the risk of accidents as people change lanes and weave around to avoid obstacles. This isnt rocket science. 

You definitely also have some line where you'd admit it's unacceptable for a car to be parked in a place if it's blocking traffic. I guess for some reason your line says it's perfectly acceptable to block half a lane of traffic, but I'm sure if someone parked blocking an entire lane of traffic you surely wouldn't still think that's okay, right? Maybe the city is to blame more than the people who park there. Maybe they should make the street wider. My argument is that those shouldn't be legal parking spots. Either way, the situation right now is asinine and unsafe. If you don't want to blame the people parking there when they're legally allowed to, fine, then blame the laws that allow it or blame the city for not expanding the street 3 feet, but don't pretend it's something that's fine when it's clearly stupid as fuck.",t2_ktvls,Pornaccount9249,0,1639813341.0,0,t1_hp0xgz9,hp0xgz9,False,Pornaccount9249,t3_rgqtxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utica/comments/rgqtxg/why_the_fuck_are_cars_allowed_to_park_on_the_side/,WHY THE FUCK ARE CARS ALLOWED TO PARK ON THE SIDE OF GENESEE STREET?!?!,/r/Utica/comments/rgqtxg/why_the_fuck_are_cars_allowed_to_park_on_the_side/hp0xgz9/,5,r/Utica,0,5

"I bought a car from them in 2018 and it was great (as a car and as an experience), but the service department must've had issues even then because I found small problems when doing maintenance myself: e.g. the oil filter housing still had a cap wrench left on it, plus someone there over-torqued it with an air gun when it only needs 20 lb-ft, plus when I had them replace the rear calipers they didn't put rubber caps/grommets on the bleeder valve, etc. These are obviously not major rip off problems like OP's but they suggest cut-corners and a lack of attention to detail, at least around 2018/2019. 

Not sure why (in today's tech driven society) more shops don't embrace the South Main Auto model and film what they do, or at least take low res photos/video to convince you their diagnosis is correct.

"Roughly 18 years ago when I was in college (and hadn't yet acquired the tools, space, and knowledge to work on my own cars) I brought my car to Mike Monopoli for an oil change and asked him to check the front tires. My mom had been going there for years and insisted to Mike that she wanted the car to be safe for me to drive back to school about 2 hours away. When we went to go pick up the car Mike said the tires were fine. Got it home and checked the oil, barely any on the stick, and what was on there was dark black. He never changed the oil. Even worse the two front tires had exposed steel belts showing from excessive wear and poor alignment. A blind person could have seen that the tires were completely unsafe. That was enough to never go back again.

"Apologies for this long reply. To put it bluntly, I found Utica to have more things to do outside of work, and found this more important than a shorter commute to work. I'm 27 and don't ""go out"" often, but I still would like to do things or even have a few more options to shop for groceries & toiletries. I grew up in Utica as well so I am biased against living in Ilion/Herkimer/Little Falls. My husband and I found our home lives outside of work were better suited in Utica, and there were more renting options than Little Falls/Ilion/Herkimer!).  

I have a similar rent budget as you! I checked out Academy Apartments first, and to be honest the entire building felt gross & smelt like smoke, and needs to be updated/repaired (the staircase inside felt like it had broken wood as you stepped on it, for example). If you live alone and don't have much stuff nor pets, I think its acceptable, it just didn't fit me. I am used to living in duplexes (very similar to those in syracuse). I found the duplex apartment we lived in Little Falls via Facebook Marketplace by the way! 

I avoided Herkimer (and even Ilion) because the city itself does not appeal to me and seemed runned down with little to nothing to do outside of work. 

The commute from Utica to Dolgeville is fine  and the worst part of the commute in the winter is actually the road between Little Falls & Dolgeville so no need to worry there . There are rumors that this year may be rough since there is a shortage of snowplow drivers so take that into consideration as the roads may be rougher to drive on in the winter if this is true. You can either go through route 5 or via I-90, as there is conveniently a thruway exit in Little Falls. 

Every city in CNY has its own pros & cons to living there, with many of its inhabitants calling it scummy and crime ridden, I try really hard to find the good wherever I live. Little Falls was great in that it is walkable if you live within the city and in the warmer months they throw many events outside as well as a weekly farmers market & craft market. I loved being able to walk down to the movie theater, bar/restaurant, or grocery store and not have to use my car as often. The canal & river are gorgeous all year and found myself taking walks far often than I do in Utica. 

Wherever you decide to live, PM me and I can help with suggestions for what to do, places to avoid living, etc..",t2_nb57r,catkirsty,0,1638468795.0,0,t1_hmyl9km,hmyl9km,False,thewasfer,t3_r34sqp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utica/comments/r34sqp/landed_a_job_in_little_falls_what_are_some_good/,"Landed a job in Little Falls, what are some good areas to live in?

"I live and Utica and don't hate it so I hope my suggestions help! Not many are outdoors, but it is something to do.

The Utica Public Library in non COVID times has a lot of programs that can introduce you to other free things to do as well. 

Munsen Williams is free (suggested donation) and if you become a member you have access to their college library, which has a lot of great indie and popular films. They also have cheap events like films in their theater and ""First Fridays"" (5-8pm). 

My husband and I ski during the winter but there are cheaper options like renting snow shoes at the Utica Zoo and walking their trails. 

I joined a book club (through Utica Public Library) and that keeps me socialized during the winter when I typically would just sit at home or shop. 

I like to treat myself to a drink at a pub or brewery (Nail Creek, Green Onion, Beer Hub, Woodland Farm Brewery etc...). At Woodland there are events often for music so just get a drink and enjoy the show! 

The Uptown Theater has shows, comedy/improv, and other events as well. 

The Other Side (part of Domenicos Cafe) has shows that are enjoyable and their coffee is great.

"I just moved out of Little Falls due to lack of decent and affordable apartment options. The canal st apartments are nice! It's about $1600/month last I looked into it.

"I wouldn’t give up on finding a place in Little Falls.  I have to go to Little Falls for my work regularly.  The upside of a town like Little Falls is that it actually has all of the stuff a town needs.  It has a grocery store, some restaurants, a drug store, a hardware store, it even has a movie theater.  Little Falls has a thruway exit so you can get there rather fast from other areas.  Some things I would look out for are:  does the place your renting have a driveway.  Yes that is a serious question in Little Falls.  Is the place you’re renting on a hill.  That town is so hilly and can be a little tricky to drive through in the winter and some places have a walk up that are down right precarious.  I personally wouldn’t look to Utica, but the commute wouldn’t be that bad, just you’d miss out on what a small town like Little Falls has to offer.

If you can’t find a place in Little Falls though your options aren’t great.  I would not live in some of the closer towns like Herkimer.  Herkimer is gross, so is Ilion and Frankfort.  Mohawk kind of sucks too, but you’ll have municipal electric (so does Ilion, just don’t drink the water) so your utility bill will be pretty cheap.  If you go further east than Little Falls there just isn’t a lot out that way.  If you like living in a small town I wouldn’t rule out Dolgeville.  It’s a little North of Little Falls and the drive down can be pretty (there’s a scenic view rest stop that’s worth checking out).  If you’re someone who wants to live in a city, good news,  Little Falls is technically a city!  I just moved to Barneveld from Utica a few months ago and I wouldn’t move back there on a bet.  There’s a lot to be said for living in a town that you don’t need to leave every time you need to get something.

"Little Falls is a beautiful little community with lots of real estate -- I was surprised that my internet search yielded virtually zero listings, so I imagine fewer landlords bother with the internet since the area is so small.

A search of the usual suspects yielded this recent listing on Craigslist: https://utica.craigslist.org/apa/d/bedroom-level-apt/7410226552.html

And there's this ""relocate to Little Falls"" website put together by (I'm guessing) the tourism board that contains contact info -- if you email them they might be able to suggest rentals: https://thisislittlefalls.com/relocate/

IMO commuting from Utica to Little Falls (~30 minutes one way, longer in snow) is not worth the hassle. Did you try searching in Herkimer? It's right next to Little Falls but slightly bigger and thus likelier to have rooms to rent.

"Just received this via a ParentSquare email:

	
 	
> Letter from the Superintendent Regarding Recent Board Action
>  
> Dear Concerned Clinton School Community:
>  
> I understand that there are many people upset with the placement of our Indoor Track Coach on paid administrative leave until further notice.  In addition to shock and disappointment, many who have sent us communication want more information about why, are concerned about the board acting in secrecy, and allude to the idea of vindictive action against the coach.
>  
> While I have been advised to respond with a simple “We cannot comment on personnel matters”, I know that the significance of this action and impact on our students, parents (present and former) require as much communication as I am legally able.
>  
> Privacy of Employees and Students is Important and Legally Protected
> You need to know that the District recognizes and values the privacy rights of its employees and students, and that it is our general practice, consistent with Board Policy and applicable laws, to not comment publicly on matters of a sensitive or confidential nature relating to specific employees or students.  
>  
> Executive Sessions
> Indeed, there are laws prohibiting school employees and officials from publicly discussing certain matters related to students or staff in a public forum.  When it is necessary to discuss information about students or staff that is of a confidential nature, and an appropriate basis to enter into an executive session exists, the Board will enter into an executive session within the meaning of the NYS Open Meetings Law to conduct that discussion.  Except in an extremely limited circumstance, any formal action to be taken as a result of that discussion occurs by resolution adopted by the Board in open session.  This process was followed at the recent meeting of November 16, 2021.  
>  
> Ongoing Process
> While I understand and appreciate the public’s interest in this matter and the public’s desire for information, the District is constrained from releasing any additional information at this time.  I respectfully request that the community allow us the time needed to work through appropriate processes regarding this matter.
>  
> Speaking as someone who has recommended this coach nearly twenty times to coach in this district (as recent as October 26th), and has publicly lauded his accomplishments and those of his athletes many times over the years, I appreciate the impact he has had on the lives of many athletes and the excellence that has been achieved.
>  
> I assure you that we will continue to act with integrity, intelligence, and empathy for all concerned in order to understand and respond appropriately to this challenging issue.
>  
> Sincerely,
>  
> Dr. Grimm
> Superintendent
> 
> P.S.  Here are some addition important points and references:
> 
> * Students and staff have an expectation of privacy when it comes to sensitive and personal matters. 
> 
> 
> * The District’s general practice is to not comment publicly on matters of a sensitive or confidential nature relating to specific employees or students.  This is to protect and respect the privacy of any individuals involved. 
> 
> 
> * There are also laws and policies that constrain the release of information regarding personnel matters. For example the District must follow the Policies adopted by the Board of Education, such as:
> 
> 
> 1. Policy 9645 – Disclosure of Wrongful Conduct.  When the District receives allegations of wrongful conduct by its officers or employees, it is obligated to conduct an investigation.
> 
> 1. Policy 1230 – Public Participation at Board Meetings. “The Board will not permit in public session discussion involving individual District personnel or students.”
> 
> * The Open Meetings Law applies to the scheduling and conduct of Board meetings.
> 
> 1. Executive Sessions are expressly authorized under the OML (Section 105) for particular purposes including discussion of most personnel matters related to specific individuals.
> 
> 1. The NYS Legislature, in adopting the OML with provision for executive sessions, “found that the public interest was promoted by 'private, candid exchange of ideas and points of view among members of each political party concerning the public business to come before legislative bodies'” [Legislative Intent of L.1985,ch.136,§1, as cited in this advisory opinion of the Committee on Open Government.  In other words, sometimes, a public body such as a Board of education needs to receive information and discuss matters in private prior to rendering any final determination on an issue.
> 
> 1. The Board properly entered into an executive session under the OML.
> 
> 1. The Board consistently and regularly enters into executive session in accordance with the OML, as to most other school districts and BOCES, as well as other public bodies in New York (Town Boards, Village Boards, Library Boards, County Legislatures, etc.)
> 
> 1. The action taken by the Board relative to a particular employee was accomplished by resolution in open session, as required by the OML.""",t2_4asad,hivemind_MVGC,0,1637281433.0,0,t1_hl6w93u,hl6w93u,True,DominickDeveraux,t3_qwrp01,https://www.reddit.com/r/Utica/comments/qwrp01/clinton_ny_students_walk_out_after_coach_norman/,Clinton NY students walk out after coach Norman Deep Jr. placed on paid administrative leave,/r/Utica/comments/qwrp01/clinton_ny_students_walk_out_after_coach_norman/hl6w93u/,3,r/Utica,0,3

"We did Halloween at Varick street one year, then Woodland the next (in the before times) and we had a good time. But it wasn't super crowded either year, and most people weren't even wearing costumes. Overall, a little disappointing to be honest.

I think most people don't do anything, or just have small house parties.
