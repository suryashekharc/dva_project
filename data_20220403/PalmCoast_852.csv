"OK Palm Coast is nothing like Athens Ga.  UGA alum here and Palm Coast resident since 2013.  Palm Coast is a new planned community that was created back in the 1970s.  It was designed to be a retirement community and the demographic still somewhat skews that way but it is getting younger. There is no quaint downtown or anything like that.  Stores are your standard fare.  Publix, Aldi, Target, Walmart.  If you need to find specialty stores like Whole Foods or REI that sort of thing you need to go to Orlando or Jax.  Flagler Beach has wonderful restaurants and bars.  It is more old Florida there.  No chain restaurants only local.

There are a lot of parks and hiking trails in PC and nearby.  I like Bulow Creek and hike it often.  There are some fantastic hiking trails within 90 minutes of here.  Little Big Econ, Black Bear Wilderness, Hontoon Island to name a few.

I'm in my 50s so I cannot speak to what it is like for a 30 something here.  I hike, bike and kayak and there is plenty of that.  11 months out of the year you are wearing shorts.  Today is a sweet breezy 75 degrees.

The hanging out and dating scene is quite dead. You really gotta go to the cities for that. PC is a resort and retirement town (my grandma even lives there lol). All the night scenes and young scenes for us millennials is south bound or out west in the state. Like Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, Tampa.

When I lived there I just hung at the pools of Hammock Dunes, my uncles beach house and there‚Äôs like a few seafood places by the beach JT‚Äôs, The Golden Lion, The European Village, etc. finding a ‚Äúcool place for young people‚Äù was difficult which is why I moved away to Savannah. I worked with a few people our age and they generally hung out in Daytona or with their families.. a lot of people it seems in the south are married with 5 children by the time they‚Äôre our age.

"Yes.  Hammock Dunes is an unincorporated area which is therefore under the jurisdiction of the Flagler County government to service through policy and budget allocations for infrastructure and amenities. Hammock Dunes residents vote in County level elections for all of the Constitutional seats which includes the County Commission.  No, Hammock Dunes residents do not have the right to vote in local incorporated municipal elections such as the City of Palm Coast or the City of Flagler Beach.  It's not suppression because Hammock Dunes are not a part of those municipalities.  Hammock Dunes has Palm Coast addresses simply because that is where the water comes from.  Residents have resisted annexation into the City because it would increase their taxes since the City would collect it's 4.65 millage on top of the County.

"For local election eligibility you should check with the clerk of courts. (https://www.flaglerelections.com/)

This is an interesting question and I wonder why you are asking? What is the suppression you are claiming?

Based on a quick search, The Hammock Dunes is owned by KDG CAPITAL, LLC. and managed by Kiran Patel, Greg Ogle, and Dheer Lshkari. All of them are listed in Tampa, FL. So no, unless there is some special exception, I do not think these individuals would be able to vote and LLC itself cannot vote. Moreover, because the hammock dunes is in an unincorporated area of Palm Coast I do not think they would be allowed to vote in regular Palm Coast Elections even if they did hold residence at the Hammock Dunes.

I sort of agree with you but then the problems begin. I do not like zero tolerance policies but I understand them. If we allow none then no one has to decide why one is allowed and another is banned when they seem to be the same even when they are actually different. If we limit the size of the vehicle or the signage on the vehicle then what about those that are only off by a little bit? If a small step ladder is OK to be on the ladder rack then why not a 20 foot extension ladder and if the is OK then why not a 40 foot ladder? If it is OK for me to have my gas powered paint sprayer in the bed of my truck then why not have a welder and acetylene tanks?  Now someone has to decide if 1% difference is ok and if that is OK then why not a 10% difference. Zero tolerance is really used to reduce lawsuits.,t2_bjw1c,ReverendKen,0,1632184899.0,0,t1_hdnsskq,hdnsskq,False,ChrisGollonOfficial,t3_po50uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmcoast/comments/po50uq/askflagler_fate_of_commercial_vehicles_to_be/,[AskFlagler] Fate of Commercial Vehicles To Be Decided on September 21st at Palm Coast City Hall,/r/palmcoast/comments/po50uq/askflagler_fate_of_commercial_vehicles_to_be/hdnsskq/,3,r/palmcoast,0,3

\-------------------

What are the bakeries? I am missing our Italian bakeries in Palm Beach. 

Palm Coast has Metro Diner and Salsas. Quite a few Thai spots. La Pizza Nostra and Napolis if you're looking for pizza. Captains BBQ and JT's Seafood in the Hammock. 

There are some good places in Bunnell. 386 Crab Shack, Bantam Chef, Terranova's, Southern Table and Chicken Pantry. 

Flagler Beach has too many good spots to list here. You can blindfold yourself and walk into a nice spot. 

Ormond has Colt's Pig Stand and the Ormond Garage Restaurant.

"I know this post is from a month ago, but I'm also a former NYker and have been living in FL for 10 years now since I was 15. I completely moved out of Palm Coast as soon as I got the chance and will never go back but I can totally understand from a financial stand point if you would need to with how expensive NY is getting and more. No real jobs (besides just mainly minimum wage retail positions), nothing to really do as far as activities besides just the beach and The European Village they have (where the elegance and awh of the place kind of wears off after a while) no real good food options besides very few decent spots. Palm Coast was made specifically for old people to retire and they never invested any money into creating good paying jobs or some kind of communities for their youth. My grandmother built a house in PC in the early 90's when there were still dirt roads and only the 1 Walmart, if that gives any frame of reference. Overall it's just depending on if you appreciated the vibe/cultures/diversity/nightlife of NYC, if you're are looking for a more front porch lifestyle kind of person and want to settle down to raise a family in a decent house, then I would say it's not too bad. But from my experience, Palm Coast is just definitely not the place for me to be.

"Not necessarily. Lol, been shooting for a while now. I know Plenty bout guns and how to use them.  Here, this is from the email they sent me.....

""The ‚ÄúVirtual Hunter Safety Course‚Äù will satisfy the in-person field day portion of a hunter safety certification. In addition to attending this virtual meeting, students must also complete an¬†online course¬†and live-fire¬†at an established shooting facility. Live-fire is to be completed on your own time. Details on the range portion are as follows:
Range Time:¬†Please download and print a target at the link below:
https://myfwc.com/media/1433/50ft-light-rifle-target.pdf
Range time is required to complete certification. After the virtual course, students must demonstrate safe shooting practices by shooting an FWC Hunter Safety 50 ft. Light Rifle Target under the direct supervision of a range safety officer, NRA firearms instructor, or licensed hunter who is 21 years or older. The student must shoot a minimum of 20 rounds. All shooting must be performed at an established shooting facility, following all safety rules and using appropriate eye and ear protection. The target must include the students name and signature, as well as the name, signature and contact telephone number of the supervising range safety officer or firearms instructor. Any firearm permitted by the facility may be used.""...


I've done the virtual safety course and the 8 hour hunter safety course. I was just wanting to compete the ""live-fire"" part they are referencing above. Again I know it is not required. And was told it would say on my hard card that I did not take the live fire course. And that if I ever wanted to get my concealed carry in the future, which I plan todo, I will have to take a live-firw course regardless. Kind of the reason why I was just wanting to go ahead and get it done and out of the way.

I had to download one of there targets to shoot at, 4 differentones on one sheet. It says I have to do it from 50yrd in a few different positions and then have a licensed hunter or certified instructor sign off on my target. üòä...lol.

I've been shooting for years now though. Just never got my hunting license. Just wanted to be official with everything. Paperwork wise. That's all.

"I grew up in Palm coast and then moved away to join the military at 20, lived in several states and then came home at 35. So I feel like I can answer this pretty easily. 

You will be bored out of your damn mind. This community is for older people, there isn't much in the way of night life or jobs outside of service/retail jobs. So if you're looking for a career that you might be able to grow in, well don't look here. 

All that aside, cost of living is cheap, but so are wages. The area is very pretty and well maintained. There isn't much crime that I've seen, though it does exist in some areas of Palm Coast (I've heard the R and P sections have higher amounts than the rest, but don't quote me).  

So my advice as someone who is closer in age than most people in this city are, is don't move here. It really depends on what you are looking for, if you want a good pick of jobs/nightlife/entertainment then I'd consider Jacksonville, Orlando, Tamp or Cape Canaveral. Also, I really don't recommend Daytona Beach, I go to school there and its just kinda gross with several homeless/drug addicts roaming about. Traffic gets bad there as well several times of year with events.

"In my honest opinion,

Palm Coast feels about half and half.  For the most part, most of the businesses are running normally as long as you wear masks.

From my point of view, I have seen plenty of people who go out with/without wear masks. It seems like people are not that afraid of Covid here and people are willing to talk to each other (Strange huh?).

I haven't seen anything too crazy yet and there are indeed some cases in Palm Coast, but that haven't stopped the entire city from operating.

People and businesses are still having social interactions on their own terms and the state is not that adamant in any mandate yet.

Overall I would say, stay safe, and wear a mask in crowded areas.

If you would like to learn more about Palm Coast or would like to visit, you are more than welcome to dm me. I'll be more than happy to inform and provide some guidance.

"White's is the closest with any affordable selection.  There are a few good ones in Orlando, but the only one that I have been to is the Amazon lumber store.  Really great selection, zebra wood and many others that I never heard of.   I go to Southern Lumber in Jacksonville where you can pick your own boards.  They have 4/4 & 5/4 S2S and rough with a straight edge.  Their prices are fair and their selection is very nice.  Biggest problem I have with them is all lumber is about 12' +/-.  I just take a battery saw and clip the bad ends.  They do not do any cutting.  Whites has a new owner, I did use them under the old name and had a pretty mediocre experience.

"Publix/Aldi are going to be your choices unless you want to make the drive.  The biggest plus about PC imo is that you get the lower cost of living while still staying coastal and you have great options still for day trips.  


30-45 you have St. Aug north (historic district, museums, trolley rides, ghost tours), Daytona south (outlet shopping, Dave and Busters, beach strip with mini golf and water park)... 1-1.5 hrs you have JAX north, Orlando south... then there is also the Space Coast area south (Brevard Zoo, Central Florida Zoo, Kenndy Space Center).  All reasonable driving distance to do in 1 day.  


As far as local things to do, mostly parks, I don't have a dog so I don't pay too much attn in regards to beach laws and which parks are dog friendly, but I see people with dogs at plenty of them, so I am sure you have your options.  We also have Marineland which if you decide to do, save up and do one of the dolphin interactions don't cheap out and just do General Admission, you will regret that choice.  


Restaurants, you have your fairly standard choice of chains, if you want something a bit more unique we have Flagler Beach which is a 15-20 min drive depending on where you are in PC, and downtown St. Aug has what seems like endless options and I am sure there are a wide variety of varying opinions there as to what is best and must go to.",t2_5y8mc,Kelldal,0,1599966335.0,0,t1_g514xti,g514xti,True,jaytwright11,t3_ire1f3,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmcoast/comments/ire1f3/contemplating_move_from_pbc/,Contemplating move from PBC,/r/palmcoast/comments/ire1f3/contemplating_move_from_pbc/g514xti/,4,r/palmcoast,0,4

/u/tomowudi has it exactly right. Palm coast ""gangs"" have always been the same petty crime crap you'll see in any city. It's not real crime by any measure. Is it worse than 10 years ago? Probably, but a lot of that stems from the same thing he already pointed out. Palm coast is ran like the whole city is an HOA, the infrastructure has always suffered for it  (the lack of), and you have a good portion of residents who are either stuck in their ways, stuck due to money, with no foreseeable fix in sight. That frustration tends to be show itself in a lot of ways.

"*nods* Yeah, I wasn't intending to characterize YOUR question as much as the opinions you've been receiving.

Just keep in mind that Palm Coast consists of Russians, geriatrics, and geriatric Russians. Lots of Eastern Europeans bought vacation and investment property here, and so Palm Coast is essentially one big residential neighborhood. The P and R sections have RELATIVELY lower-income housing, but the rent in those sections isn't cheap either. I'm paying $1500 for a 3/2. That's $200 to $300 more than what I might pay in Deltona, which has Section 8 housing and a bit higher in crimes related to drugs and ""gang"" violence.  https://www.bestplaces.net/compare-cities/palm_coast_fl/deltona_fl/crime

So what is being characterized as ""gang violence"" is actually just the sort of petty crimes that are normally associated with lower-income housing, which pretty much describes everything in the state of Florida that is not behind a gate manned by a security guard.

The biggest issue I would be worried about if I were you is that Palm Coast treats the entire city like it's run by a homeowners association.

"According to the City Charter, Palm Coast has a ""Weak Mayor"" form of government and the mayor SHOULDN'T have much of a day-to-day impact (that's why the salary is only around $13,000/year) but there is still an incredible potential impact to set the direction of the city. 

Four years ago, a number of local business leaders went around and campaigned for Milissa Holland because they wanted to change the fact that 80% of the city's revenue comes from Single-Family Homes/property taxes. A healthy city should have that number be around 60%. That number being so high means our economy is not only missing out on opportunities but that economic downturns hit us even even harder. 

**Now, that same number is 92%!** 

The biggest reason for this negative trend is the over-politicization of every single building/planning project in the city and the mayor's corrupt dealings (like those with her daytime employer) which has shut out business for lots of different companies and industries. We currently have no one doing anything resembling economic development in the City of Palm Coast (ditto at the county and our Chamber recently closed) so we are still sliding down into even worse economic conditions as we speak. 

Because of that lack of commercial development (and jobs), we're able to do less as a City. That means less streetlights, less sidewalks, less safe bus stops, a municipal fiber network that hasn't seen any movement in 4+ years, and lots of other things the city needs to survive and thrive that we can't afford because we're too focused as a city government on an app.",t2_5ti6o,Schottey,0,1595096081.0,0,t1_fyhen0q,fyhen0q,False,Schottey,t3_hrvpai,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmcoast/comments/hrvpai/hi_reddit_im_mike_schottey_and_im_running_to_be/,Hi Reddit!

"I live on a canal in the c section and I'm 42 wife is 37. Definitely a lot of older people around but we get along well with our neighbors.

There is not a ton to do around town unless you like (nature type activities) beach, fishing, boating, kayaking, etc. Beyond that Daytona, Orlando, and Jacksonville are not that far away.

The schools are rated pretty well if you live in the c section. We send our kid of school age to a private school in St Augustine which is smaller and a lot less robotic then the public schools. Which allows her to focus a little better. Our friends daughter does very well with the local public school. 

If you buy a canal home make sure it's close to the intercoastal. Try to stick to a concrete block home. Cul de sacs of course are the best for less traffic. If the home has all impact doors and windows that's a plus but not necessary. Look at the bulk head, it's expensive to replace.

Flooding is supposed to be everywhere, but the storm surge (flooding from the coast) is pretty much only an issue for folks on the coast or intercoastal (if you have a doc or a waterway in your backyard.

So, if you want to avoid a power outage and don't feel like driving through heavy winds and rain, it's looking like getting out today is better, easier, and safer than tomorrow.

1. Beach
2. Nature trails... Walking and biking
3. If you drink, find a few local to hangout at the bar for conversation and local tips.... Houligans, Olive Garden, Carrabba's are the safer ones but there are others around.

":p Same with both RDR2 and Spiderman - I've already beaten Spiderman once, and once, but I'll be doing it again with New Game Plus. :p I actually just got my PS4 specifically for those two titles, and because I have been wanting to play a few other exclusives as well (ICO, Shadow of the Colossus, etc.). 

World of War Crack is on my resume as well, but MMO's really lack the sort of story engagement that makes the grind worthwhile to me. Skyrim, for example, I could grind on that like a cheap stripper and never get tired. Even the Elder Scrolls Online I found really captivating, but too difficult to really stick with all by my lonesome. To that end I'll be picking up Anthem for sure, because who the hell wouldn't want to play as Iron Man in a world full of huge monsters?

I play MHW on the PC, and I DO love it, but haven't played it in a hot minute after my friends moved on. Persona I have heard good things about, so will definitely check that out.

Right now on the PC I have Ark, Skyrim VR, Assasin's Creed Geodesy, Windlands, Doom VR and World's Adrift taking up most of my time.

"I worked in the tax collector‚Äôs office back in 2014. You will pay less if you pay in cash or with a check. Visit the office on Palm Coast Parkway (near Planet Fitness and Staples) and not the one in Bunnell (the line is always longer there). I also recommend getting there when they open (8am I believe) to get the quickest service. You may wait 10-15 minutes. Also, be sure to check the Florida website for the DMV and ensure you have all of the correct documents that are originals (no copies allowed). They will send you home if you don‚Äôt have originals.

> A Palm Coast man rigged the front door of his in-laws&#039; home in an attempt to electrocute his pregnant wife, deputies said.

> &quot;Based on observations made by the deputies on scene, it was apparent that the suspect rigged electrical devices to the top door lock and lower door handle in an attempt to electrocute and cause serious bodily injury or even death to whomever attempted to unlock and open the front door of the residence,&quot; sheriff&#039;s spokeswoman Brittany Kershaw wrote in the statement.

> After being shown several photographs of the crme scene, Steven Bray, a journeyman lineman from Florida Power and Light, estimated a person touching the door lock and the door handle would be exposed to approximately 120 volts and one amp, enough eo cause &quot;An approximately 80-100% chance of suffering death or great bodily harm,&quot; the report said.

"Thanks. When I was down there in July I randomly met a few people that had lived less than 30 minutes from where I grew up. And I think every cashier had originally been from the North. Seems like a transplant community. 

When it comes to jobs I am not too concerned. My wife has been looking for a teaching position for a long time here in NY and has had to settle on teaching assistant positions (minimum wage) because its tough here. With a decade of Elem. Ed. experience, a Masters Degree from a NY school, and certification in Reading/Literacy we were told she should slide into a job easy in FL. (Its how our friends wound up in Palm Coast) As for me I am almost certain that my job can transform into 100% telecommuting, if not, I planned on looking to St. Augustine. I'm in Marketing, Web Design and Video Production. 

My sister moved to Orlando back in '03 and has told me not to buy into the hype. I am not moving to FL for the cost of living anyway. It was to escape the poor job opportunities for my wife, and I am finally sick of dealing with snow for 5 months out of the year.

We went through a foreclosure back in 2014, and I told myself it would be a very long time before I purchased again. I'm happy renting for the time being. Also puts me in a better situation if for some reason we do need to move back, hoping that's not the case.

"Thanks for the information, it is certainly appreciated. We spent two weeks in Palm Coast this past Summer with friends (They live in the L Section) and the one thing we did notice is that they were pretty far from everything else. We've been researching for about two years now, and with Matthew and now Irma I noticed it seems smart to live west of I95. 

Most of my friends and family think I'm crazy. My area of NY sees little to no natural disasters, just snow, lots and lots of snow (From Oct/Nov to March). They think I am putting myself and family at risk, or just running away from problems, grass is always greener type scenario. 

We definitely plan to rent first. We were homeowners before, but rent now and I find it much better. I've already been in contact with a few realtors.

Depends! Our county like Gainesville is diverse we have apartments in the center of palm coast that are what you are looking for but is of course busier as far as traffic and personal space seems limited as it is very developed. There are some apartments on the outskirts of town that are still within reasonable travel time to stores/shops and also less expensive but more secluded and quieter. Most everyone here rents a home or a duplex as the apartment pool was only recently filled in the past 8 years. Personally I would check out integra woods on belle terre it's on the outskirts but recent developments and road connections make all travel in town about 20 minutes to get anywhere.

"Alright so....Your music scene is going to consist of older gentlemen in Acapulco shirts on the beach side that know Jimmy Buffet and Garth Brooks songs well enough to get a chance to play a little gig during happy hour while their wives look on in mock enthusiasm. 

Of course some of the more talented ones have formed these dad rock bands and can pull off some Springsteen or KISS to a respectable level.

As far as a record store goes there was this really awesome one....I think it closed up shop back in 98 and nothing ever came along to replace it. 

As for bars you have your choice of 4 kinds. Biker, redneck, sports bar or beach themed.

Alright what else? Punk scene? There is no scene here of any kind for anyone. 

Let me give you a clear picture. Palm Coast was started up back in the day as a retirement community aimed at drawing in older folks from up north which it did a good job at. It was sustained by the construction industry that provided all these homes for the growing population of the elderly and their tag along families.

Housing market crashes, construction stops. Lack of well paying industry in any other field becomes painfully apparent. 

Local economy dries up. The area that was set up to be a mall is now a cow pasture. The area that was supposed to be a thriving down town has all the framework there like parking spaces, street signs and lamps....but no buildings so it looks like some alien force scooped up everything.

Anyone who was capable of getting the fuck out while the getting was good has already done so. The population that remains are elderly, the family members who moved here to leech off them or working people like myself who are trying to make the best out of the situation and hoping property values rise to even a shadow of what they once were. 

Aside from all that, if you're stuck moving here your best bet is to get used to the drive north to St. Augustine. You'll find a wider range of things to do and people to interact with. There's some sense of a local music scene there. Though not enough to be considered regular or coherent.

If you actually want to attend decent shows and such then you get used to driving to either Jacksonville or Orlando. With Jacksonville being the stronger recommendation. 

And jobs? If none of the bars I mentioned appeal to you and customer service or medical work isn't your thing then you're probably going to be driving out of the area for work as well.",t2_cgmvy,_CowboyFromHell_,0,1444783585.0,0,t1_cvyuj2o,cvyuj2o,True,BriElzebub,t3_3om52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/palmcoast/comments/3om52j/oi_oi_oi/,Oi oi oi!,/r/palmcoast/comments/3om52j/oi_oi_oi/cvyuj2o/,3,r/palmcoast,0,3

"The ""don't live here"" zones are a little overkill. Every section in Palm Coast has good and bad aspects to it. I live in the P section near Presidential/President Ln and it's great over here. Homes are well maintained, everyone for the most part looks out for each other and thankfully we have had no crime in the area. 

There are other parts of the P section that aren't so great, but it's hit or miss. You could move to any section and have someone move in next door who causes problems. 

The section in Palm Coast are referred to by their street names. The P section has street names that begin with the letter P. The same goes for all other sections. If you pull up Google Maps, you'll be able to see each section by simply looking for what letter the street names appear. 

The P section is near and around the Buddy Taylor Middle School/Wadsworth Elementary School area.

The B section is near Indian Trials Middle School/Belle Terre Elementary.

I have lived in Palm Coast for a good part of my life and for the most part it's a great city. There isn't much of a night life but it's well kept and has everything you'll need (in my opinion).

I have friends who live in the R section, its nice, but I'm told there are more reported crimes. 

C section has a lot of nicer housing. Usually where people who have more money live. The entire section is on a canal, its very nice. 

I live in the B section and right next to the a L section. I like the place that i live, i feel it is one of the nicest in town. The L is a close second. 

There are two areas of palm coast, the main town, and if you drive about 15 mins, you'll be down by a target which leads to flagler beach. 

~~I'm not sure where you could find a map of the sections, but Google maps shows street names.~~ All the B's are the B section for instance. 

This is a map of the area. SOme of these location I have never been to in my 12 years of living here.
http://www.donnatofal.com/about-palm-coast.html

Your friend told you to move to ""E, C, Z, or Double I"" I talked about C, but the E, Z, and LL are very close to Bunnel and away from the main town. They are next to target and closer to Flagler beach. Bunnel is a quaint little town a part of Flagler, in which many people here may call ""Podunk"" The town itself, seems very poor and there is a lot of farmland surrounding it. But Bunnel has some of the best places to eat.

E,Z, and LL would be zoned to go to Buddy Taylor MS, and FPC HS (Flagler Palm Coast HS). I have only been to the surrounding areas, but never to these actual zones.

The best way to really understand would be to come down here and check it out. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask.

"Hello [r/palmcoast](http://www.reddit.com/r/palmcoast/), we need your help. I‚Äôm with Tails From The Barkside Pet Rescue, a licensed 501(c)(3) charity based in South Florida, and we need help finding forever homes for two of our rescues. 

If you are interested in adopting one of the dogs below you can reach us at tailsfromthebarkside@yahoo.com. You can also follow the dogs on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/TFTBS) or visit our [webpage](http://www.tailsfromthebarkside.org/) (looking for web design help)


&nbsp;


**Leia:**

This sweet 6 month old princess was found roaming the streets of Miami. When Leia was brought in to Miami-Dade Animal (high kill) shelter she was severely emaciated, anemic, full of worms, marked with scars and sick with kennel cough. No one knows exactly what she‚Äôs been through or how she survived. Leia weighed only 16 pounds when we rescued her. Nearly all her bones were visible and she was very weak. 

For the past month we have been nursing Leia back to health, and we are happy to say she has nearly doubled her body weight! 

Leia gets along great with most dogs and prefers a cat-free home.  She loves to sit by your feet, on your lap or anywhere close to you. Consistent meals and toys are new and wonderful to her, and she enjoys laying out in the grass working on her tan. She is learning commands well and is (expectedly) very food driven.  
Pics (sorry some aren‚Äôt great quality):

**Pixie:**


Forced owner surrender, it is suspected Pixie was used again and again for backyard breeding. She spent much of her life in a makeshift cage with no comforts or protection from the elements. She was heartworm positive and urgently needed veterinary care. Pixie has been given medical treatment and love for four months; she is now ready to be adopted!
With your help Pixie will never need to worry about her living conditions again. This 5 year old sweetheart is great with kids and adults. An attention hog, Pixie would do best in a home where she is the only dog. Pixie is a couch potato, she‚Äôs low maintenance and easy to please. Good Girl Pixie is ready to be your best friend!

If you or someone you know would like to adopt Pixie or Leia please contact us. If you can help network them on social media we would really appreciate you sharing them. We are offering a free Barkside [t-shirt](http://www.tailsfromthebarkside.org/our-store.html) (designed by Redditors) to any adopter or referral leading to Leia or Pixie‚Äôs adoption.

"Where are you staying? Palm Coast is more geared toward an older crowd, honestly. Daytona is only about 45 minutes away. I'm sure there is plenty of drink, party, and music with folks closer to your age, if you're okay with the drive. Flagler College is in St. Augustine, those people must party somewhere. There are great restaurants and probably a few bars there, as well as B&Bs. I highly reccomend St. Augustine, although its loaded with ""touristy shit"", its all interesting. It's the oldest city in America and it holds a lot of cool shit too. Try the Ripley's ghost tour at night. Drink from the fountain of youth, it tastes like shit but, its the fountain of youth. I remember some Art's and Craft stores there also. I never went in, so I cannot speak to those.

"Do yourself a massive favor. GTFO. Leave and never look back. Go to a big city. Or a cool small city (boulder, portland, fuck even richmond, va has more going on). 

Think about it... You live in a town that thinks drum circles are edgy, that 'art' is a painting of a pelican, and music is fucking Jimmy Buffett. JIMMY BUFFETT!! Everywhere you go, ""have a blessed day"". ""Bless my fucking shit hole!""

Drive through Flagler Beach on a Fri. night. Are these the people you want to hang out with? Old shithead middle age bikerfags yelling ""ROCK-N-ROLL-BLAARRRRPPPP!!!"". Or even worse, the shitty new age hippy twats and their wind chimes.  Fucking FUCK that! 

You will slowly go insane, and in 15 years you will end up killing yourself.

Edit:

"We had a great meeting today. We had a decent sized group and some excellent discussions. We had a couple of new people show up that saw this on reddit. 

It was good to see that some younger people with fresh ideas came to share their thoughts with us. I am always a huge supporter of today's youth and to have them represented so competently was a thrill.

I hope to see even more show up next month.
