There is a big Sikh community in Abbotsford. The biggest by percentage of the total population in Canada actually. There are plenty of minority communities in the city. That being said there is also quite a bit of racism and Abbotsford used to be the KKK HQs for Canada in the not too distant past. I have personally never found Abbotsford to be racist as a community but growing up here have had a few incidents of run ins with racists. I have had more racist run in when in Aldergrove though and have spent very little time in that community and the most racist run in have all come when visiting the US (mostly in rural Washington). Probably had less than 10 total incidents of overt racism in my life with most being more low key. Despite what people say you can tell when racism isn't overt and I've experienced it mostly at work and benefitted from great managers and coworkers quickly stepping up to shut the racists down.,t2_vgdur,JG98,0,1648324455.0,0,t1_i28afmj,i28afmj,True,Toronto-Bev21,t3_toy3ab,https://www.reddit.com/r/abbotsford/comments/toy3ab/hows_the_racism_in_abbotsford/,How's the racism in Abbotsford,/r/abbotsford/comments/toy3ab/hows_the_racism_in_abbotsford/i28afmj/,2,r/abbotsford,0,2

"From my experience, Abbotsford has a high amount of white people who are very conservative which manifests itself in ways where white supremacist power structures are so entrenched that it's almost impossible for many residents to imagine an alternative. So for example, the Mayor and city council (one of whom, Brenda Falk, is a notorious racist) will promote Christian holiday celebrations and highlight Christian non-profit organizations while completely ignoring the Sikh community holidays or community contributions.

There is a large Sikh community here which is really a huge blessing to our community. But a significant portion of the white population sees them as many older white people see all people of color - you'll hear Sikh parts of town being described as ""high crime"", ""run down"", ""shit hole"". People refer to schools with majority Sikh students as ""inner city"".

Having said that, there is also a growing portion of the white population that realizes the importance of tearing down these legacy power structures.

"I used to live in Guelph and needed to do customer visits on a regular basis in Toronto. Back then, the highway had two lanes (very much like we have now) to Mississauga and it was general congestion every time I did the trip.

I went back just before the pandemic on a business trip to Guelph and from there went in the morning to Toronto. They had added an extra lane and it was even slower than it was when there were two lanes. Exact, same, thing will happen once Highway one will have three lanes to 200th Avenue.

The problem with roads is that availability drives demand. So, more lanes = more cars. The great thing is that with trains, availability drives demand and so, more and better train service.

"If you're speaking specifically of Mennonites then yes, there might be Russian ones in Chilliwack that moved there directly from Russia.

As you probably already know, there are many more Mennonite churches than that in Abbotsford. Yes, the population of Abbotsford is higher, but Chilliwack is 60% of the population of Abbotsford and definitely doesn't have 60% of the number of Mennonite churches, especially when you consider whom Yarrow actually serves.

There's then a Russian Orthodox, an Ukrainian Orthodox, and two Dutch Reformed churches in Chilliwack. Abbotsford, despite it's larger population, has just has one Dutch Reformed and one combination Ukrainian/Russian Gospel church.

Media Release- Fatal Collision Involving Cyclist

Today, March 18th, 2022, just after 3:30 pm, Abbotsford Emergency Services responded to a serious collision involving a cyclist and a vehicle in the 2500 block of McCallum Road.

Upon arrival, emergency service workers located the cyclist who had sustained critical injuries. The cyclist was transported to hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The AbbyPD are currently confirming the identity of the cyclist and have no further details at this time.

The driver involved in the collision remained on scene and is fully cooperating with this investigation. The driver did not sustain any injuries but is very shaken by this incident.

AbbyPD Patrol Officers, with the assistance of the Integrated Collision Analysis Reconstruction Service (ICARS), remain on scene and are in the early stages of this investigation. Both directions of McCallum Road Rd are currently closed between Braun Ave and South Fraser Way. The AbbyPD will provide an update on our social media once the road re-opens. 

Investigators seek witnesses and dashcam footage from those who may have been travelling along McCallum Road just before the collision. If you can assist, please call the Abbotsford Police Department at 604-859-5225

"I can't speak to ticketing practices now, but I used to be a lifeguard there, for \~7-8 years.

Make sure to bring rash guards, they help a lot with keeping warm because they hold the heated water more than they chill you from being wet.

The lazy river is the warmest non-hot tub water. Take drying off breaks and eat some warm food.

">The government has been using excessive force against the Indigenous population since they started colonizing.

and you saying you approve of that right? Because if you don't then why would you approve of someone else being abused or having their rights taken away? You can't have it both ways, either it's wrong then and wrong now or it's fine in both cases. 

>Also you seem to be completly glossing over the fact that changing the federal mandate would do nothing, because the US still has the same mandate in place. 

well if that's your argument then why bother putting it in place at all? Make These guys happy and cancel it, it makes no difference. According to you there's absolutely no reason to have it in the first place because if we didn't things would be exactly the same. So why pick this fight?

The fact is it does make a difference of course. It would pressure the Americans to drop theirs tremendously. Their truckers would push for it very hard. So either you're right and you're wrong or you're wrong and you're wrong

>And yes once a protest becomes an occupation, the rules do change. 

no, the rules change when a judge rules that a protest is illegal. That's it. And that is how these things are handled, someone goes to a judge, Judge says the protest is illegal, the police do what they need to do.

As to the indigenous people if you can keep your racism and bigotry out of this conversation it would be helpful. And as to other protests, first Nations or otherwise, there has never been a time when emergency act was used to suspend their civil liberties. Ever. Nor have their bank accounts been seized, or people who support them threatened. Many people have lost their livelihoods permanently just for saying they support them.

I'm sure given your comments that it bothers you to know and that these people have been treated even worse than the indigenous protesters but that is actually where we are at.

Take a scroll through some older posts from the Wetsuweten Check point Instagram page, to see the militarized forced used against Indigenous people simply trying to defended their unceded territory, from the unlawful construction of a pipeline. Unceded means it was never lawfully surrendered to the crown just fyi.

While you are there check out Main Beach and if you're into it the boat rentals - it shares the parking lot with Cultus Lake Adventure Park. Waterslides accross the street which I believe shares ownership - I think waterpark tickets used to get you discounted admission to the adventure park.

"If it's just a 2.1 system (2 speakers and a sub) you'll be looking at anywhere from $100 - $200 for setup from a business as a minimum fee. Best Buy, London Drugs, or Visions should be able to do this for you. 

It is easy to set up a speaker system that small though, I've done audio installations for nearly ten years now and taught people how to do this level of setup in 15 - 20 minutes. 

Make sure your receiver is off.

If your receiver is at least 20 years old, it will have [Digital Optical](https://www.the-home-cinema-guide.com/wp-content/uploads/optical-digital-audio-connection-0.jpg). If your Receiver is older than that, you'll need an [Analog-Digital adapter](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ucYLUu7SL._AC_SY355_.jpg) which are roughly $30-$50 depending on quality. A better quality unit will give your analog signal a better pass-through, meaning a better quality sound, but the digital side either works or doesn't, there's no in-between. 

Unless your receiver is <5 years old and has HDMI eARC (google ""your receiver's model number + HDMI eARC"" and it will tell you) you'll want to connect optical for the best bandwidth. Your receiver also may require a setup connected to a TV. If it's just a 2.1 setup, it's not really required, you can generally skip this by hitting the back or cancel button, but if you want to go through it your receiver will walk you through with instructions on your TV.

Connect the speaker wire to your Towers, hopefully, your wire is color-coded, red for positive and black for negative, but if they aren't it's not terribly important as long as you are consistent. Then route the cable over to your receiver and connect it to the Front Left and Front Right, respectively for each speaker. 

After everything is connected, you'll want to go into your TV's audio settings and change the output to either Optical or HDMI eARC (whichever you connected). Then power on your receiver, select the audio source you're connected to, and you should have sound and bass. You can tweak the receiver settings afterward to get better audio results.",t2_78skr,westleysnipez,0,1647367822.0,0,t1_i0s1xu4,i0s1xu4,False,meish_7,t3_tep1tq,https://www.reddit.com/r/abbotsford/comments/tep1tq/speaker_install/,Speaker Install,/r/abbotsford/comments/tep1tq/speaker_install/i0s1xu4/,3,r/abbotsford,0,3

"What about just waving the same flag that 99% of us do on a daily basis? None. 

You can be a good, loving human being and positive community member without any flags. 

Remember that the majority of people who are using flags lately are trying to generate a feeling of self-determination and control during a time when all of us feel that we‚Äôve lost some of that due to COVID and other global issues. The operative word: *trying*. They‚Äôre still just as out of control as the rest of us are, but being angry and getting together in groups and sharing that anger in brash, ‚Äúin your face‚Äù ways, is making them feel better. 

If you need to wave some flags to make yourself feel better, that‚Äôs truly okay. But ask yourself *why* that particular action will make you feel better, and whether a simpler, kinder, and more constructive action could take its place instead.

"This guys got money.

The Fraser can produce some nice fish when it's open, but salmon openings are rare due to the run sizes and conservation attempts. You can fish for Sturgeon from the shore above Mission; might not get the monster fish the guides will help you locate but still fun.

There are several rivers that are hot for Coho salmon for a month or two (late September to the end of October if you want silver fish that aren't already turning). The Chilliwack/Vedder is popular but easily accessible spots can be crowded; Dewdney slough (lots of room along the canal to fish from shore). There are other streams and rivers in the valley, that are productive. Unfortunately the increased population and pressures on the stocks have reduced the number of locations that are open and not overly crowded.

There's several lakes that you can catch trout in year round. 

I would suggest a boat would increase your options. Read the regulations for Region 2, talk to the guys at Fred's maybe. If you are on Facebook there's a page ""Fraser Valley Fishing Addicts"" but it's mostly about bragging, not sharing locations.

"Fishing in BC really peaks around the fall salmon runs, so the hype is a bit different from what year round pike and muskie in Ontario get you.

For year round fishing itches I definitely recommend Jones Lake for trout, which is generally good. The Vedder Canal under the HWY-1 overpass is great for float fishing (obvious snags everywhere) but I've pulled some great catches out of there with roe bait. Trout, salmon, catfish, and even a little 3ft sturgeon who was promptly released. Personally I still believe the game is at its best with the amazing fights you get from Pinks and the giant Coho salmon.

On that note: if you're a career fisherman taking a day to catch I giant white sturgeon is something that should be on your bucket list. I did it once when I was 15 and it was a game changing experience.

LMAO, you have been doing that to multiple people, including doing it to me multiple times. If you're going to be an asshole repeatedly, don't complain when someone dishes it back at you.

No, you actually said the opposite, I quoted you on that already.

>>""Low qualifications can be forgiven under the excuse of trying to get support out fast."" And let's consider you've stated changing the rules after the fact shouldn't be happening.

>How does that statement mean we shouldn't clawback support.

It doesn't. You butchered what I said. Try again, slow down and work on your comprehension.

>You keep saying changing rules is some big sin.

No, I keep pointing out that when you though it was being done, you said it was a big sin.  I've been very clear about that. Comprehension isn't your strong suit, is it?

>Once again the Liberals are the ones that created these rules in the first place.


That's not a valid reason to ignore the rules.

>Secondly, yes we should be clawing back from those who can afford it.

Perhaps, but the courts would shoot that down. You can't make the rules and then change them after the fact.

>Getting support out quick was a necessary evil that corps didn't need it where able to take advantage.

Sigh... I already pointed that out to you. You responded with ""Like was said before, using rules liberals wrote as an excuse isn't a good argument."" Quit contradicting yourself.

>The point the Liberals are clawing back from individuals while letting corps that don't need the money take advantage.

That might be your new point now that multiple people pointed out your old point was wrong, but that was to be argued at the time and perhaps get change at the time. Adjustments were made due to the public feedback at the time. Those adjustments, however, always only applied to things going forward; it would be illegal to backdate it. To try and state that it should be changed after the fact demonstrates you have no idea how our laws and courts operate.

See, you're constantly a dickhead, and then try to play the victim when, in response, someone dishes it back to you. It's time to stop acting like a 13 year old. When you're clearly wrong, say ""Ops"" like an adult. And stop with the constant insults to try and ""win"" an argument, it just make you look worse.

Next time, be better informed so you can get the facts straight the first time. That way you won't have to keep modifying your ""point"". If you had, I could have simply said ""Because that would be illegal"" right from the beginning.

If I was Liberal, then do you think you constantly trying to insult me by calling me that would actually work?

The facts at hand are you claimed they came up with this after the fact, and thus it's an improper clawback. You've double downed on it multiple times. You were wrong.

"The only real solution is a high speed rail link. When I say high speed, I'm not talking TGV kind of speeds, I'm talking 150-180km/h trains.

An interim solution is to modify the HOV lane. I get the purpose, and I understand the green passion for these things, but they really only work when there are alternative transport methods. Furthermore, for 80% of the day, they are occupied by cars that aren't removing a car from the road. Which is the entire purpose of an HOV lane.

How do you modify? Dynamically with lights, or static with times. In other words the HOV lane into Vancouver is only active during rush hour. 7am-9am. At other times, it's a regular lane.

Dynamic is even better. The lane is always HOV unless traffic controllers see a need to alleviate flow. For example, an accident, an intersection blockage, etc.

The best bet would to call a 24hour limo service based in Abbotsford and have them pick you up and drop you off. They are used to driving from Vancouver during those hours. They have smaller luxury cars as well. The airport lists more options on their website.

Problem with the Coast is you're on one end of town and the only restaurants within walking distance are mostly chain restaurants and fast food. Most of the good restaurants are downtown Abbotsford with one of my Favorites (Brodeurs) being all the way on Mt.Lehman.
