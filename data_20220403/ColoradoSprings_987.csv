"Hey there,

So Saturday night before Super Bowl some presumably drunken and irresponsible trash sideswiped my car, and others, as it was parked on Cross Creek in Fountain. You can see the tire marks in the ice at the roadside where it travelled off the road.

Not sure why I didn‚Äôt bother to post here sooner, but the cops we‚Äôre looking into it as it hit more than one car.

This road is wide. Like bike lanes and oversized driving lanes wide. This person was entirely out of control late on that Saturday and smeared the side of multiple cars, removing several driver side rear view mirrors and costing me and my neighbors thousands.

If you know of anyone who demolished the right side of their car that night in Fountain, please PM me any details you can share.

We aren‚Äôt looking to put anyone behind bars- but this person totally screwed up, ran from it, and should pay for damages for their irresponsibility and issues they caused multiple individuals.

"I read a ton of sci-fi and fantasy. Also non-fiction - mostly history and biographies. I've also been working my way through the collected works of Agatha Christie and John LeCarre. In short, I'm a PPLD super user. I probably check out 50 or more books per year.

The key is to actively manage your holds queue. If the first book of a multi volume set looks interesting, put the entire series on hold. If Book 3 becomes available before Book 2, the PPLD website has a great feature where you can defer your check out for a week or so at a time. This keeps you at the top of the queue, but allows someone else to have a turn while you're waiting. 

I also use filler books while I'm waiting.  I don't like to start a new multi volume series before I finish the old one. So if the next book isn't available, I'll read a short stand alone book while I wait.

"The library stocks its shelves based on demand from customers. If they have Twilight books on the shelves, it‚Äôs because at some point, like 15 years ago when those were popular, people wanted to read them.  And now they sit. Also, they have way fewer hard copies of books in general now because people like e-books. I read half a dozen books in the last month‚Äîwithout having to drive to the library to check out or return them. You should try it, while you‚Äôre learning about how modern libraries and readers operate.

"I think both of the previous comments had valuable insights. A. What do you define as acreage? And B. Have you considered Woodland Park?

The good news is the cost of living isn‚Äôt as high as what you posted. I‚Äôve seen gas stations up to $4/gal (but may be more in Woodland or Cripple Creek due to proximity). Property taxes are some of the lowest in country, but will vary (I looked up a 2.9 million listing in Cripple Creek and the taxes were noted to be $1556 annually‚Ä¶that doesn‚Äôt seem right as we aren‚Äôt that low, but they may be posting the current homeowner‚Äôs rate with exemptions (which would be more common, but normally that‚Äôs noted so others would know too). YOu could spend #1200 on groceries, but I think you‚Äôd have to try/eat a lot/buy only the expensive items. Utilities, of course, will vary with use, and I don‚Äôt know Cripple Creek Utilities well enough to quote anything on this (But it wouldn‚Äôt be uncommon to have a septic, a well system, and propane as options too). 

The quick search I did found 12 active homes with 2 being over the 650 budget. The others before 650, are well below, BUT may not have what you need as they appear to be smaller places too. One of those 12 and also one of the two (Coming in at 725) is in the Cripple Creek Mountain Estates. It looks to me like this is a newer area since the home I found was built in 2019 (There‚Äôs isn‚Äôt much new in Cripple Creek). 

Considering that you wouldn‚Äôt mind a drive into town, CC may not be bad for you. I do think weather is a factor and depending on where you‚Äôre coming from, you may be experienced with colder weather. What you may not be as experienced with, is driving down a mountainous pass to get into town during colder weather. I would say concerning Woodland Park and maybe Divide would be good as well. All in all, I‚Äôd want to know more about what you really want/need in a place and consideration of other close by areas. To that end, let‚Äôs chat!

"I've lived near Red Rocks Open Space and Bear Creek Canyon and have never seen a coyote in 50 yrs. I hear them in the summer, along with the foxes I never see. I've seen a few little bears. Never saw a mountain lion, though I'm sure they have seen me. If you leave a small dog outside, something, such as a bird of prey or numerous carnivores will eventually eat it.

"Also, I personally like how the symbolism represents the original idea's for the city. Lewis Palmer wanted the city to be a city surrounded by parks, and that is what the green is about. And I would say that is still representative, though the city has expanded outside the parks.

  
The gold bars are a bit archaic, as the pikes peak gold rush is long over.

 When it comes to the asymmetry, I like it personally, though I had designed a non-rectangular flag for the whole rocky mountain region, so my liking of asymmetry might be too much.

There is also a bit of accidental symbolism that represents the city's majority views(like the happy pope look in the emblem showing the religious side of the city), but I won't go too much into that.

"Define ""acreage""... A shack on 19 acres is listed for $350 k in cripple creek.

For about a 3000 sq ft house (about $500k) we pay, $15 a month in garbage, $150 in electricity, $150 in gas,  $80 in water. 

Gas prices are easily found on AAA or any gas app, but keep in mind that 87 octane is ""mid grade"" in most places in the mountains. I'd stimate $4.40 a gallon.

Taxes run about $2500 a year, and insurance is about $2200. Both will scale on the value of the property.

The only thing that stands out is ""acreage"" and a $600k budget.

"The ""spike"" collars that you've probably seen herd protection breeds wearing is not going to help your dog if theyre getting attacked by coyotes and every dog wearing those collars gets pretty roughed up themselves by their own collar a lot. Coyotes don't usually ""clean kill"" like cats try to, it's often just biting something until it is hurt, then ripping it apart until it dies.

It all depends on your location too. Some places you'll never see a coyote even though you know they're around. Other places you definitely need to lock up your small/medium dogs if you don't want them to be attacked.

I've personally seen 2 coyotes in a driveway stare down a car trying to get in the garage in broad daylight. My elder neighbor's dog was taken while he was walking on-leash on a busy street. At one point, 6 of my neighbor's had lost their dogs to coyotes and ours was attacked when my mom let our Shih-Tzu outside to go potty. My mom had to run at it with a broom to get it to drop our dog before hopping the fence. There was one year when our neighbors had outdoor cats, and then all of a sudden one year where everyone stopped getting more cats because they realized they were just feeding the Coyotes. Coyotes are REALLY smart, so they were watching our neighborhood and learning the times when dogs would be let out to go to the bathroom. Eventually, we all had makeshift weapons so that we could attentively watch our dogs while they shat. My dad went to some crazy methods to get rid of them.

This wasn't here in the Springs, but I'm letting you know from first-hand experience what Coyotes are capable of.",t2_jy4z95r9,logicallandlord,0,1648847375.0,0,t1_i3174my,i3174my,True,[deleted],t3_ttynpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/ttynpn/coyotes_and_dogs/,Coyotes and dogs,/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/ttynpn/coyotes_and_dogs/i3174my/,1,r/ColoradoSprings,0,1

"Depends on the dog and the situation. A full-sized dog doesn't have much to worry about from a coyote, nor is it common for a coyote to attack a dog that is with a human. 

Little dogs are snacks, though, and a coyote that thinks humans are pushovers might be bold enough to go for even an accompanied one.

There are few hard and fast rules with predators. Personally, I would not leave a small breed dog outside in Colorado. A big dog, I wouldn't think twice about.

"From the AP link in the OP article:
  
>Forest Service officials say gatherings in recent years left surprisingly little impact on water, erosion and other areas of concern to forest officials. With a fraction of the normal participants this year, the concerns are even fewer.
  
Keeping in mind that you yourself admit that some legitimate sites need to be shut down to heal. 
   
Which also makes this link in OP article on how [your (our) camping is also destroying the environment](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/environment/your-campsite-destroying-nature/) very relevant. If we consider cumulative damage of a large group over a few weeks compared to that of millions over a the camping season, I don't see how they're causing more of a problem. So no, I'm still not convinced by anything you've presented that this is an egregious violation of environmental stewardship.
 
> Established campgrounds have vault toilets to contain the human waste. And they still need to be managed an emptied. 
  
I think you're hiding behind ""established campgrounds"" because some of the most popular trails in Colorado do not have these waste management systems and late in the year are packed full of buried human waste at the ""campsites."" Read some reviews on the hikes, you can't miss the reviews. People even time their trips to these sites avoid the build up. 

> I‚Äôve read the news reports on their past gatherings. The have a pretty bad track record for Leave No Trace.
  
Then I'm surprised you haven't linked those. I haven't seen anything in your linked sources or anything I've found in my search to demonstrate that. 
  
>It can take years for an area to fully recover from something like this. 
   
How many years does it take to recover the sites BLM shuts down when they become overused? I don't see much of a difference. A couple years to fully grow back in a meadow seems minimal in the grand scheme. 
  

  
I'm, again, not advocating for the group and therefore I don't care what your other motives are for wanting to stop them, but I'd prefer if you focused on those motives instead of the environmental pearl clutching. The fire hazard is the legitimate environmental threat, yet it seems rangers regularly walk their camps and hold fire safety clinics within them. The simple fact that this has been ongoing since '72 and I can't find an environmental incident and they clean up their space seems to make it clear they're not dismissive to the need to care for habitat.

"Downtown Colorado Springs posted this today. Pretty good April 1 joke. 

> We're getting Ziplines!
Downtown Partnership is excited to announce the launch of Springs Urban Zipline (SUZ), a new form of transit that aims to ease traffic congestion and get people to their destination quickly and with a sense of adventure.
‚ÄúWith all our new apartments and hotels Downtown, we have thousands more people moving about our city center. PikeRide bike share, scooters and a new shuttle are fine, but we need a form of micromobility that exemplifies the rugged outdoor lifestyle we‚Äôre famous for here in Colorado Springs,‚Äù said Downtown Partnership President & CEO Susan Edmondson.
The first SUZ will traverse north from the historic Busy Corner at Pikes Peak Avenue and Tejon Street to the popular Bijou-Tejon intersection at Acacia Park. The zipline is scheduled to launch in late April and is a beta test for a series of ziplines throughout Downtown. ‚ÄúNext week we‚Äôll introduce a new ordinance to City Council to require all Downtown buildings of 5 stories or more to integrate the new Springs Urban Zipline,‚Äù said Edmondson. ‚ÄúWithin three years expect to see about a dozen ziplines throughout Downtown helping people connect to their destination.‚Äù Downtown Colorado Springs is not the first urban center to have a zipline, but ones like Fremont Street in Las Vegas and ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs longest urban zipline‚Äù in Dubai are purely for entertainment purposes. Edmondson says Colorado Springs will be the first city to integrate a network of urban ziplines with the primary use as a means of mobility, and recreation as a secondary benefit.",t2_nsldz,happysnappah,0,1648824028.0,0,t1_i2zlirg,i2zlirg,True,AutoModerator,t3_ttq338,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/ttq338/free_for_all_friday/,Free For All Friday!,/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/ttq338/free_for_all_friday/i2zlirg/,11,r/ColoradoSprings,0,11
"That‚Äôs great to hear about that they have good trash management. Established campgrounds have vault toilets to contain the human waste. And they still need to be managed an emptied. 

30,000 people in one spot is not dispersed camping. And when dispersed camping starts having an adverse impact on a landscape, land managers have restricted it, and installed managed campsites. Because the landscape can‚Äôt handle that many people. This has been happening in Colorado from Pikes Peak to the Utah border. I‚Äôve read the news reports on their past gatherings. The have a pretty bad track record for Leave No Trace. It can take years for an area to fully recover from something like this. If people want to go do drugs in the woods, fine. They should follow Forest Service rules of limiting the group size to 75 people. Anything larger than that requires a permit. They aren‚Äôt a special exception, they can follow the rules like the rest of us.

"My concern is the environmental impact. If 30,000 people are going to be in the wilderness, there needs to be a plan to manage human waste.

I just don‚Äôt see that much volume being properly managed without good organization and management. The Rainbow folks claim they will just bury it. 

Another way to look at it‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs about the same volume as three 20 ft school buses. So they would needs to bury a school bus-sized volume of poop about every 2-ish days. That just feels like a lot of poop to manage responsibility.

"Think of it like DIA parking. If you're just dropping somebody off you can do that for free. If you're going to drag them inside with their bag, you can park in Short-Term for $4 an hour. That lets you park right next to the terminal. 

But if you park in Short-Term and get on a plane and come back, then it's $4 an hour *every hour*. So your 3-day trip cost you $288 in parking fees. ""Total ripoff!"" Well, no, you chose a premium spot.

If you're gonna be gone a week, go park in Intermediate. If you're gonna be gone a month, go park in Long-Term and take the shuttle in. If you're gonna be gone 3 months, take an Uber to the airport and leave your car at home.

So..... now think of Manitou Springs.

"The drunks at the Royal Tavern are the clientele of one establishment, whereas there are a couple other dozen restaurants and bars that the rest of the town goes to and in fact does keep alive. Do you live here? How often are you in the bars and restaurants in January and February. If you lived here you'd recognize the locals and it would be completely salient that they are in fact the majority patrons, not just in those two months but most of December before Christmas and also April after spring break ends. The true peak season is May to October ending with the coffin races. I guess you can say the start is with the Carnivale Parade but again, that is just part of March and for April it dies back again.

So as you say, clearly the bars and restraunts are the big share of revenue in this town, the shops don't even compare, but who do you think spends more money in the shops, especially the art galleries and jewelry type shops that are quite pricey, is it the people who are so deterred by $9 for 3 hours of parking by those shops or is it the people who are completely unfazed by it? It's not even like you don't have another option, you literally have a free option. You can say it's a money grab and frankly it is, and why should I care? The revenue funds the road maintenence and other infrastructure in the town, it pays for the events that bring people here, lets us beautify the town. Fund our education better. You are asserting that the parking will drive away so many people as to reduce our visitor numbers but I just don't see it. Because again you have other options, you are not being made to park miles away and then walk, you get to park for free and then get a free ride the rest of the way.

As for what I do, I don't want to give too many personal details away but I manage one of these businesses(Bar/restraunt) here on Manitou ave. so from a local business perspective I absolutely want more turnover in those spots in front of the business, or that the group that has the money to not care about the price to park all day goes there because those are the people that will actually spend more money here. I think looking at it from the perspective of a restaurant is a great way to look at the revenue model for the whole town in regards to parking. If I have a table, who orders food, and then proceeds to sit at that table and at best order maybe another round of drinks for the next hour after eating is making me way less money than getting two groups who buy one course and one round of drinks in the same amount of time at that table. If someone parks in one of those spots for 1 or 2 hours, they likely are just getting lunch or dinner, and possibly stopping in at one shop. If someone else parks there for 5 hours, they still probably only are getting one meal, depending on when they park but even if they eat twice that is one group getting two meals in those 5 hours vs 3-5 groups getting one in the same time.  Maybe the group that is there for 5 hours pops into a few of the shops while circling around, but they probably at best are buying a t-shirt or some trinket from maybe one of those places. If the people parking in those spots are the ones who don't care about $9 for 3 hours or $24 to park there the whole day are the ones meandering around, well it is pretty clear that they will buy more and expensive things than the current average group.",t2_nfiw6,086709,0,1648748876.0,0,t1_i2viqfx,i2viqfx,False,EmBejarano,t3_tsovx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/tsovx7/manitou_springs_to_implement_progressive_parking/,Manitou Springs to implement progressive parking rates in pilot program,/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/tsovx7/manitou_springs_to_implement_progressive_parking/i2viqfx/,1,r/ColoradoSprings,0,1

"Clearly it in general is not driving people away as our visitor numbers have continually been climbing for at least a decade now. If you want to save money then park in the free lot and take the shuttle. If you want the convenience of parking on manitou ave, and to contribute to the traffic problem then why shouldn't you pay a premium for it? If you want to spend the whole day here why should you take up one of those central spots, where as a group coming for lunch for an hour or maybe stopping in at 1 or two shops are far less likely to come if they can't park close as the walking/transit times come up to maybe 50% of the time they are here, you coming for the whole day the shuttle takes up just a few percent of the time you visit. Denver county for example has a population density of about 4k per square mile, in a really popular area with lots of fopr traffic and hence demand for parking in the area you might see a daytime density of some 10k. Manitou's residential density is about 1500 per square mile(at about 5k population) but during peak season daytime, visitors outnumber residents easily 20-1. As just a rough estimate, and even rounding down that makes the demand density easily in the same range if not higher than many popular areas in Denver. If we just look at the areas vistitors are, and hence want to park, which is an even smaller area just on manitou ave, the demand density easily surpases what the demand is in downtown Denver. We are doing just fine if you don't visit as there are easily another 10 people that do.",t2_nfiw6,086709,0,1648745611.0,0,t1_i2va6g3,i2va6g3,False,EmBejarano,t3_tsovx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/tsovx7/manitou_springs_to_implement_progressive_parking/,Manitou Springs to implement progressive parking rates in pilot program,/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/tsovx7/manitou_springs_to_implement_progressive_parking/i2va6g3/,0,r/ColoradoSprings,0,0

"Oh I would love that, I am a huge proponent of public transit, I use it when it is reliable and reasonable to use for the trip. But you are talking about a town with a population of 5700 people, not a bustling city, with a business core that is just some 5 blocks long. Where does this train station go? Do we raze our already limited supply of housing? Or even it it stops somehwere a bit away, like say where the current shuttles stop, that still means shuttling everyone the rest of the way. 

Even if the funding just magically appeared for that, we are a \*county\* where there are literally no local passenger trains anywhere(light rail, metro, tram, etc). So to solve our problem with that we need to get Colorado springs to take on a project and acquire land downtown and then undertake a construction project that easily would out strip the entire budget for every other form of transit combined, to solve their neighbors traffic problem? A great local example is Denver's light rail system, the airport line which for a huge length of it did not have to aquire land that was already occupied still came out to over $52 million a mile. Where do the tracks go btw? The whole area between Manitou and c-springs is filled with houses and apartments that are primarily lower income people that work in the businesses there and on the westside, I guess they can just get fucked. Or lets destroy the creek, we can just build on that.  I guess the metro solves those problems, but also again, how are we paying for this? We have a general fund for the town of just $12 million. In large cities with metro systems, the cost per mile is anywhere from $500 million to $2.5 billion. Yes that is right, just for a single mile. If Colorado springs paid for it, the city would be completely bankrupted before the first mile was completed as the general fund is about $300 million a year currently.

&#x200B;

[This](https://imgur.com/a/TAyRvpb) ""modest"" route would doubly bankrupt the whole county, of course it wouldn't actually as it would probably still take a good 5 years to construct after at minimum 1 year of public comment, another 5 for environmental review and then a good year of planning and further public comment. In order to solve the traffic problem though we need a ton of parking, so a decent parking garage would be another what, 50 million? It doesn't really do much though as it just pushes the traffic onto no mans land there. and it would need further tunneling to connect with a metro depot, which with those facilities and tunnel to them would be another cool hundreds of millions. For a metro that doesn't even connect to downtown Colorado Springs. I mocked up a few more that actually could be usable in that album and it is financially completely infeasible unless the state and feds intervened to fund it and still took over a decade for construction.

Let's talk bikes, It would be great to have bike lanes, but we are talking about how to transport the 300k+ visitors, not the less than 5,000 residents. Visitors from the springs can already bike the midland trail, on concrete all the way up to the overpass where, guess what there is a bus stop! Almost no one actually does this though. People who flew into the state or are coming from much further away can rent a bike, but guess what? There already are bike rentals there and in Manitou, and it makes hardly a dent in the traffic.

Also speaking of the shuttle, It is a real bus, that starts right where the city bus stops at and runs even more frequently than the city bus. Increasing the frequency of the Bus from downtown is entirely up to you all in the springs. It gets a fair bit of use but with the car culture in this state, or at least our county good luck getting more people to ride it. 

So we have 2 real options here, build another shuttle even further out with even more parking, and then increase the service frequency and hope people will still come here even though the visitors are so adverse to public transit, or maybe if we really beg for it the springs will partner for the only local rail option that would exist in the county with a tram type system. Even though the city already hates basically any public transit and would much rather serve other, more important routes if they ever mustered the political will do build one. 

TL;DR, you don't live in Manitou and basically all of your recommendations are either ineffective for our situation, or so completely outside the bounds of what is financially and politically possible in this county that it is laughable.",t2_nfiw6,086709,0,1648743481.0,0,t1_i2v4hr6,i2v4hr6,False,EmBejarano,t3_tsovx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/tsovx7/manitou_springs_to_implement_progressive_parking/,Manitou Springs to implement progressive parking rates in pilot program,/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/tsovx7/manitou_springs_to_implement_progressive_parking/i2v4hr6/,1,r/ColoradoSprings,0,1

"My family has been here for 3 generations so I didn't move here and I still complain lmao. I dont care if someone moved here yesterday and has an opinion or if some of the 5+ generation residents have an opinion too, we all live here and deal with thr reality of the situation. 

We aren't Morrison ruining Red rocks, as Morrison isn't the attraction. We, our town, are the attraction here. We love the visitors, everyone knows that is what keeps the town going, and it is an incredibly fun place to be during tourist season, but things are unbearable in their current state as far as parking goes. If the people who work in the businesses can't get to work and park there, what are you going to have to do when you visit? If the residents, who are the ones that keep the businesses open during the off season when it becomes practically a ghost town get driven out by a lack of parking, well there will be no town. 

Maybe I am being a bit hyperbolic, we aren't on the verge of collapse but maybe you all who don't live here can keep your 2 cents to yourselves as you're not the ones effected here. The parking situation also makes the traffic way worse for residents and visitors alike as people circle around repeatedly for spots that just will not open up instead of going to one of the shuttle lots. Increased turnover for the limited, and never increasing number of Manitou ave parking spots could get more of these cars to stop circling around. There is literally zero room to put in more parking without putting in a garage and that will be a bigger death blow to the town. The charm of it is that it is a small, dense walkable town with lots of activities to be reached on foot after you get here. If we start tearing down buildings to build more parking around the core then the town will no longer be what people are coming to see in the first place.

"I don't think we have enough info to judge him so harshly. The most basic question that needs answered is, was S&R even *needed*, or is the only issue that they were called in when they weren‚Äôt needed? The article doesn‚Äôt come right out and say, but there‚Äôs details to suggest it might be the latter. It says he had equipment and a plan, and was ultimately able to walk out on his own.

I admit I take this personally because I strongly relate to this kid. I live in Colorado now but got my start on 14ers the same way, driving in from a neighboring plains state. I got a *lot* of experience that way, eventually more than most locals I'd talk to on the trails, but I still got a lot of condescending scrutiny just for being an out-of-stater, even from people with substantially less knowledge, preparation, and experience than me, and it was incredibly frustrating.

Coming from out of state on a special trip for his birthday weekend means he probably couldn‚Äôt push the trip back, despite the forecast. Still, with all the safety lines in place (popular trail, staffed camp, emergency shelter, summit house, more direct alternate descent routes), barr trail in the winter makes for an ideal place to test your preparation for more extreme conditions. The S&R people say he had some ‚Äúreally good gear‚Äù. I know when I hiked it coming from out of state I carried a hell of a lot more gear than I would now, I was *way* overequipped. If for example you have a 4 season tent and are truly prepared for precip and sub-zero temps, attempting an ascent might not have been that unreasonable, and descending in the storm realistically might've been more dangerous than just waiting it out (even if you have altitude sickness, which isn‚Äôt fatal at 14k feet).

He apparently made some basic errors in not fully fleshing out and communicating his contingency plan, so search and rescue got called, and I agree that's always something to be avoided. But as far as we can tell, that might have been his only mistake, the rest could be chalked up to bad luck despite good preparation. If so, it was a mistake of being overly conservative (having S&R called too soon), rather than under, and that‚Äôs exactly the type of mistake we want to encourage.

As for the progressive rates, do you have a better idea? Lots of people want to visit, but the way it is is first come first serve with no incentive to make space for other people who want to come here. People stopping in for a short time will be more likely able to find a spot in town with the increased turnover, and if you want to come for the day, well park in the shuttle lot and ride up.

>there's no such thing as the ""right Republican"".

I didn't say that. I'm not even talking about making sure the ""wrong Republican"" doesn't get elected. I'm talking about making sure the ""wrongest Republican"" doesn't get elected.

Look at this particular race and an example. Leon Kelly has beat his Democratic challengers 65/35 in prior elections. So more than likely, the Republican is taking this post no matter how you and I vote in the election. The race is already over.

So who do you want to be our Coroner? Kelly, a qualified person who has been doing the job without issue for years, never making the non-political job political...

Or Weber, the completely unqualified primary challenger who will make sure Colorado Springs never has another covid-19 death... by refusing to sign any death certificates listing it as the cause?

Pretty clear choice here for me, so I'm going to make by voice heard while I still can. Voting in the Democratic Primaries is basically pointless in this county, even in the Presidential Primaries. So grab that Republican ballot, vote against the ""wrongest Republican"" in the Primaries, and vote against whoever won the primaries in the election.

"Pikes peak is summitable, and will likely have a footpath broken the entire way to the summit, year round. I've done it twice in winter. There's very rarely any avalanche risk, and you only need microspikes and trekking poles (not crampons or ice axe). It's got a staffed camp halfway to the top (*open year round....*) and an emergency shelter near treeline. Hiking it in the snow is totally doable and can be a uniquely fun experience, assuming you have the right gear, which this guy did. You call it lucky but I don't see any reason to think it wasn't deliberate.

Sure he should've checked the weather and better communicated his contingency plan to his family, but otherwise it seems like he did exactly what you're supposed to do: let someone know his plan and when he was expected back, as well as have a contingency plan for spending an extra night out if needed.

For bars, we really like Mother Muffs in OCC. There's also a cool place downtown called Coati.

"Morning! I see you already have the first step lined up, which is work, so let‚Äôs chat about eh rest here. Really, without knowing more, it‚Äôs going to be hard to recommend a lot. For the example, you mention a speakeasy, so Allusion would need a mention, but you didn‚Äôt mention what sort of food you‚Äôd enjoy (My newest recommendation has been Ambli Global). Same with clubs, we have them here, but I think you‚Äôd find a bigger scene in Denver too. Which you could live in either area and drive, depending on other factors. 

Questions then:

1.	There is no best area to rent a house here. You don‚Äôt have a commute obviously so that‚Äôs not a factor, but what will make it best is what you‚Äôd want to be near or home amenities. The rental market is tough, as is the buying market. 
2.	Covered this above, more info would help, but let‚Äôs start with Allusion and Ambli (Atmosphere Gastropub is also pretty cool). 
3.	No, we aren‚Äôt a skiing/mountain town. You can find a few relatively close by, Like Breckenridge, Monarch, Keystone etc. 
4.	People won‚Äôt care about where you are from. We have a strong military presence so we have people from everywhere here. 
5.	Bonus, saw you asked about areas for young professionals. This is more a factor of budget and where you want to live than demographics which is doubtful that anyone will reliably know. 

Lastly, let‚Äôs chat. I happen to be a local realtor who has helped folks make a move out here.

"Your 3rd question could be easily answered with Google but no; not really. You‚Äôre further from a lot of the bigger resorts (versus Denver) by an hour or hour and a half. You do have some access to smaller resorts but again, they aren‚Äôt necessarily close. 

Honestly by what you‚Äôre looking for (remote workers into speakeasies, clubs, skiing) it sounds like you both would do much better in Denver. This isn‚Äôt meant to be exclusionary and i‚Äôd be happy to make other suggestions but based on that list‚Ä¶COS doesn‚Äôt seem like the best place. If you said churches, dive bars, dogs, and trail running- I‚Äôd tell you you found the perfect place. Maybe I just haven‚Äôt explored CS enough. 

Also I guess in order: downtown, north end, patty Jewett area, Briargate or OCC.

People probably care less about the foreigner thing but will care that you are moving from California. The only thing worse is if you‚Äôre from Texas before that lmao

(Btw. I‚Äôm from a big metro. Unless you hike/trail run I have a fear you‚Äôll be bored here. Most of the trendy stuff here comes from Denver and Denver isn‚Äôt exactly trendsetting. Denver and CS are wonderful for some things but cool clubs and nightlife and restaurants isn‚Äôt one of them (yet).

"Hi there. Fellow millenial who moved here last fall from DFW. I haven't had any issues driving around with my Texas plates and traffic is nothing compared to Texas lol. We found the housing market better than Texas but still hectic and expensive. Our research led us to COS for the price/houses on the market. I don't think prices are cheaper here, but maybe slightly compared to Austin. Like others said, be sure you have jobs lined up. Now coming from suburban Dallas most recently, I don't find COS that conservative but I also don't have kids so maybe schools are a different story. I have met many liberals/progressives here but it's not Denver. If you love the nightlife and diversity in Austin (I went to UT), that will be a big change. I don't drink much anymore so bars weren't on my checklist. I'm far from the only minority in town and haven't had any issues, but that's just my experience.

"I just had panels installed-- they've been active for a little over a week so far. I went with Peak View Solar and I've been happy with the entire process. They're at https://www.peakviewsolar.com

If you're planning to connect to Springs utilities even with panels, you can get net metering, where you pay for the power you use minus the amount your panels produce. They'll allow a solar setup that's rated to produce up to 120% of your previous year's use. I'm not sure how they calculate that if you're new to the area.

I didn't go with batteries-- it's a lot more expensive that way.

Another option besides having your own panels might be Sunshare, a solar ""garden"". They have larger solar farms and members basically sign up to lease (own? I'm not sure) part of it and get credit for the power in their share.

"Colorado is definitely a politically progressive state as a whole, but, if you want to live in a progressive community, check out the most recent election map, and that‚Äôll tell you where those areas are. Colorado is a lot like Illinois in that, while Illinois is a ‚Äúblue‚Äù state, the majority of the actual inhabited landmass is red, and most of that blue is in Chicago. Here, it‚Äôs Denver, Boulder, etc. 

Colorado Springs is awesome in a lot of ways, but it is not generally a progressive city. May not be the place to look if you are looking for a progressive immediate community. 

If you don‚Äôt really care about that, though, you could do a lot worse than the Springs. 

In this county, there are subdivisions and apartments going up in droves. They‚Äôre slowly working on the housing shortage, but it‚Äôll still be a while until things catch up. Housing is stupid expensive, and the bidding wars for buying houses are still out of control. I know several people who have been approved for ~$600k loans and are still getting outbid. 

Not trying to talk you out of it. If I were in TX, especially these days, I‚Äôd want to gtfo. But there are a lot of people with this same mindset all over the country, so there are loads of people trying to move here for the progressive political ideals.

If _you_ had plans longer to stay, you should have just re-signed, and taken her name off the lease when she chose to leave. It's possible.

"I grew up (MS+HS years) in Austin, although I did live here as a younger child. I moved back to the Springs in 2020 after spending most of my 38 years in Austin. There's a lot of hate towards Texans on the internet, and if you still have Texas tags on your car, you're going to get some sneering looks. But as long as you're not an asshat and think you're better than everyone else because you're a Texan, you'll be fine in normal every day life.

COS is a fairly conservative city, compared to Austin, though. It's probably more like a big Round Rock politically (but at least we have a fairly liberal State govt, unlike Texas). Housing-wise, rent is _just_ as godawful as Austin, but the housing is a little better if you're looking to buy (but still pretty bad).

You might also want to check out places like Pueblo or Canon City. They're a little smaller, but more affordable. Unfortunately, there's also more property-related _and_ violent crimes.

I can't speak of jobs here, as I'm holding the same job that I did in Austin (which is remote).

As far as Spanish, I don't think I've heard anyone speak Spanish natively here.

Yes, we anticipate rates with cause some people to drop out of the market but even with that, we are still at inventory lows that create supply/demand concerns. As such, step one, as it often is, is making sure you have a job lined up when you arrive. Knowing where you‚Äôll be making will help set a budget and a path forward for pretty much everything else. 

Next, housing. Renting and buying here is tough, but can be done. If you‚Äôd like, I‚Äôd be happy to have a deeper chat with you about moves as I‚Äôm a realtor who has helped several people to make a move like this.

The roommates lived in the Springs for 8+ years and decided to move to live with her boyfriend in New Mexico and left us with a massive bag. It's her fault we are even paying the month to month 1600$ (now split 2 ways) because she demanded we switch from a 6 month lease (1200$) split 3 ways. She is also still on the fucking lease and uses the appartment as storage for all her shit without helping us with the rent. My partner sees nothing wrong with the situation. Realistically we wouldn't be in this situation at all if the roommate didn't make us go month to month instead and then leave us holding the bag.,t2_2kxhm330,TylerTheSnakeKeeper,0,1648654421.0,0,t1_i2q5m6l,i2q5m6l,False,TylerTheSnakeKeeper,t3_trce6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/trce6j/what_do_you_mean_we_dont_earn_enough_to_rent/,What do you mean we don't earn enough to rent?,/r/ColoradoSprings/comments/trce6j/what_do_you_mean_we_dont_earn_enough_to_rent/i2q5m6l/,1,r/ColoradoSprings,0,1
