Red light cameras are illegal in iowa as the way traffic code is written states that an officer must witness the infraction to issue a ticket. They only keep them up because they are counting on those that don’t know this to pay the ticket. I’ve had several (that stupid camera at Singing Hills and Hwy 75 gets me every time I turn right no matter how long I sit before I turn). I’ve never paid them and they can’t effect your credit and they can’t issue a warrant. It’s legally not enforceable.

But really, there are plenty of hotels along the highway exits. Downtown might be alittle pricier, but you’re getting the location and perks of proximity to fourth street and the stores/restaurants/ bars near the casino. If you’re looking for something reasonable but still allowing you to check things out quickly via highway proximity;  I’d stick to the hotels near the southern hills mall. Also, lake port commons has a good variety of chain restaurants and stores, the mall is across the road. Downtown you’ll find all the local places, Buffalo Alice, diving elk, Rebo’s, Marto’s, and a good couple more. Also downtown you’ll get the promenade cinema, the bars, and the hard rock.

People been saying that about the west side of Sioux City since at least the 1950's. I grew up on the west side. My working-class family co-existed along side other w-c families and lower-income and minority families. We all survived and in fact flourished. Just like every other city and its neighborhoods- do your due diligence when buying a house and choosing where to live. But keep an open mind and weigh all the factors when deciding. You may end up with a selection that is a diamond in the rough. I moved away from SC after college in the 70's- just lucked into a job that was too good to pass up. When I bought my house in a suburb of Chicago I was looking in a neighborhood very much like the west side of SC. People had the same opinions about it. I bought the house and have never regretted it. It's not perfect but I can't afford perfect and don't think I want to live in Perfectville anyway. My neighborhood is diverse and neighborly and that suites me fine.,t2_e4m91,dfishgrl,0,1644948467.0,0,t1_hx2b9tn,hx2b9tn,True,CvScout72,t3_sspwzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/siouxcity/comments/sspwzn/is_the_west_side_really_as_bad_as_people_say/,Is the west side really as bad as people say?,/r/siouxcity/comments/sspwzn/is_the_west_side_really_as_bad_as_people_say/hx2b9tn/,5,r/siouxcity,0,5

"Regarding the difference between Sioux City and Sioux Falls - housing in SF is becoming outrageously expensive, while housing in SC is still much more affordable.  If you're looking for a lower cost of living, SC is a better choice.  And I think the city is on the upswing.  I'd rather go shopping in SC than SF any day.

If you picked Council Bluffs you'd be closer to a lot of other employment options for your family.

But if you're looking for a touristy area with tons of casinos you should look at Deadwood/Lead South Dakota.  The casinos there operate year round.  Housing is sure more expensive than it was, though.

"The Hard Rock is generally always at least has some people at the tables when I'm there and gets really busy on the weekends. As far as sioux city if you are looking for a quieter town that still has everything you need sioux city is a pretty good fit. Downsides are it can sometimes be boring and infrastructure can suffer a little bit.
 However all the downsides aren't as nearly as bad as people say in my opinion.

 Sioux city has things to do like concerts and sporting events. The nightlife downtown has gotten a lot better in the last 10 years IMO. They also have a lot more to offer for kids than 10 years ago like a trampoline park and cone park for snow tubing both added within the last 10 years. They're also getting a tilt fun center in the mall. It can be boring but it is far from the most boring town I've seen. If you expect entertainment on par with Minneapolis then you're gonna be disappointed but for SCs size there's plenty to do.

Infrastructure isn't great but I've never had any major problems with the roads. I've driven my Ford fusion around the city for years and get around fine. People just complain.

The smell of the sewage plant might hit you but I only smell it like once a week for 10 seconds usually. Fuck maybe I've gotten used to it lol

I'd say the biggest pro is that people are more laid back here than you'll find in the omaha and sioux falls metro. It's small enough to have to have a more family oriented feel but big enough to have everything you need. Come in wanting a quieter, blue collar, and probably smaller community than you're used to you might like it. Just don't expect some major city. 

Probably the best thing you can do is visit the city and see how you feel.",t2_14w1lv,shaydog53,0,1644204657.0,0,t1_hvwe2x7,hvwe2x7,True,[deleted],t3_sm1pon,https://www.reddit.com/r/siouxcity/comments/sm1pon/moving_here/,Moving here,/r/siouxcity/comments/sm1pon/moving_here/hvwe2x7/,4,r/siouxcity,0,4

"Personally, I'd choose sioux falls over sioux City if I were moving from out of state. A few advantages of SoDak over iowa are. 

1. No state income tax. That's a pretty hefty raise, depending on your income. 

2. Cheaper vehicle registration between my two cars, I pay over $1200/ year in registration renewals in Iowa. SoDak would be ~$200

3. It's strange, but the road quality seems to be much, much better up there. Sioux City doesn't want to fix their streets until they either build a new events center or they have 10,000 patches on the road. 

4. It's a much better restaurant and nightlife scene in sioux falls. Not to mention, during the summer, there's wild water west to visit, falls park etc.

The old YMCA on Nebraska.  The guy who owned it last fell into health issues and basically demolished the inside and went bankrupt with medical bills before he could do anything with it.

"Expanding on what I said earlier, there's a chance a good few of them have been repurposed or bought. I've not been on that side of town in almost 4 years. But about 15 years ago, all of the elementary schools on the west side fell into disrepair and the school district elected to build a new unified school for the west side district instead of repairing the outdated buildings. The schools were closed in 2015 after construction of loess hills Elementary was complete. And from what I remember, only Roosevelt Elementary and Crescent Park Elementary have been repurposed. But I believe the rest of them may have been forgotten about, at least I assume because a couple of them, the last time I saw, had busted windows or overgrowth that rarely gets tended to.

And I don't know how ambitious you are, but I also remember learning from decades old sioux city journal entries about an underground neighborhood beneath historic 4th street called ""The Sudan"" that was basically a 3 or 4 block long speakeasy and brothel during prohibition times.

"Ok, so a couple of ideas here:

1. I would recommend downtown, it has a lot more access to the things you mentioned: activities, nightlife, potentially other young professionals because you have the Sioux City Chamber of Commerce located there, as well as a couple of other organizations like Sioux City Growth Organization, meet in that area fairly often. Plus, the big new event center is down there and a lot of these groups have been holding meeting there. There's like 3 - 4 coffee shops many young people like to use as well so that's promising.
2. If downtown doesn't seem to have anything available to you then I would recommend Morningside as an alternative (or the Sunnybrook area since there are a lot of new apartments going up there I believe). It's a very centralized area so almost all the rest of Sioux City is pretty quickly accessible within 10 - 15 minutes away.
3. Obviously, living close to wherever you're going to work is always a nice advantage. It saves time and money spent on gas etc. So that's always worth looking into.
4. FInally, and this is a bit crazier of an idea so take the advice as you will. You have quite a bit you're working with cash-wise. I know the market isn't necessarily in the MOST ideal place at the moment but it might be worth looking into purchasing a house. It would open up a lot of avenues for you and, again, based on your financial state doesn't sound like it would be outside of financially viable. I jumped on one this summer and my payment are about $1k/month (just the mortgage granted) but that amount is actually OVER what I'm required to pay since I'm trying to put a little extra towards it every month.

It would allow you to have friends over and offer some other great advantages as well. And it leaves you with an asset for resale in the future if you decide to move. Just an idea.

"Honestly, I can make a few and you just decide what you're hungry for when you get here.

**Note:** These are entirely based on my personal opinion, I'm not out here to bash any restaurants, and I'm not making myself out to be some sort of reviewer or expert. Just my personal recommendations, take them or leave them. No need to start fights in the comments section.  


**Shahi Palace:** If you like indian food this is what's available and it's (in my opinion) very good, although admittedly I haven't been to many indian places before. But I've never had something here that I didn't like and the Na'an bread is a fantastic addition to anything you order. Just be warned if you go with ""hot"" on any dish you will be feeling some pain.

**Tokyo Steakhouse:** If you're willing to spend a bit of money then Tokyo Steakhouse is fantastic and the portions are massive so I can guarantee you won't go hungry. Again, it is pretty pricey though so be warned.

**Mr. Stirfry:** Is a great option if you're looking for a ton of sushi, otherwise, it's an Asian buffet and they also have one of those make-your-own stirfry setups like Huhot. The buffet is average, but the all-you-can-eat sushi is a great highlight. It's not the finest sushi in town like Fuji, or Koi but it's still very good and for the price, it's hard to argue.

**Koi:** If you're willing to pay more for your sushi and want some other options as well Koi is a great place (the main one on Hamilton, not the express one on Floyd). I HIGHLY recommend getting the green tea. It's my personal favorite.

**Kahill's:** Always one that everyone recommends. It's a little pricier, but the food and view are VERY good and worth it.

**Marto's Brewing Company:** Is a great option if you want some drinks, and I highly recommend either the giant pretzel or the pretzel bites, but I personally haven't been a huge fan of any of their other food.

**La Juanitas:** You want the best burrito you're going to get? Then this is the place you want to go. There's a lot of fights about La Juanitas vs Guerros, personally my choice is La Juas so take that as you will. Make sure to go to the one that's in Sioux City, IA; and NOT the one in South Sioux City, NE. 

**Pete's Thai:** Is basically your only option for Thai food, but that's not to say it isn't good. It's definitely tasty and a nice switch up to all the more frequently depicted international foods.

**El Fredo's Pizza:** If you're feeling for pizza I HIGHLY recommend El Fredos. Personally, it's my favorite, their sauce is incredible and unlike anything you can get anywhere else.

"I like Sioux City, I graduated from law school in Des Moines and actually chose to come back here because I went to college here and my girlfriend lived in the area. But, I don't think we should bury our heads in the sand and pretend like this town can stand toe to toe with Des Moines, Omaha, or Sioux Falls when it comes to amenities. I went to the Chamber dinner this year, and it was actually comical how out of touch the chamber as a whole felt (I guess that shouldn't really be surprising, bit still).

"I don't live in SUX, but volunteer there once a week, and read the Journal daily.  So here's my impressions:  downtown is just on the cusp of revitalization, with artists and ethnic restaurants and a strong Hispanic cultural movement.  Nicer old homes are north and near east; newer nice home are SE.   Because meat packing and processing is still a part of the economy, there can be a smell from the plants (mostly west.) 

When it comes to elections the majority of people do vote republican.  There are towns to the north of SC that are EXTREMELY Dutch in heritage and are crazy, crazy, ""conservative"".  They hate everyone except other Dutch people.  They lurv them some t-rump!  People will say that they don't discuss politics, but they do, of course.  As an old white lady, I'm astounded at the racist and homophobic and etc. things people will say to me just as a part of regular conversation.  However, because SC itself has been becoming more and more Hispanic, politics aren't clear cut anymore.
You may have to be ""don't ask don't tell"" about being Gay among older residents, but I think the younger people are much more used to finding a variety of people ""normal"".  My impression is that the downtown arts scene people are a friendly group and might be a good community for you.

"Eastern NE, Western IA, Eastern SD, Southeast MN - all accessible 1.5 hrs from SC.  All farming areas rather than ranching areas.  SC's early economy was based on being a railhub for the western cattle industry, and on meat packing and processing.  

A lot of people think that North/South Hwy 81 is a good theoretical dividing line between The East and The West.  I'd put it a little further west at Hwy 83/183.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

"I moved to Sioux City when I was 18 and have lived here on and off for 18 years. I personally don’t like it, but I don’t really enjoy living in the Midwest, so it’s not just Sioux City. 

I don’t think the crime or drugs or anything like that is really a ton worse than other places of similar demographics. Those are things that can be criticized about any city. The things that make me dislike it here are the lack of things to do that aren’t eating fast food or drinking or gambling, the bad public transportation, the slum lords that seem to own whole neighborhoods and never improve their properties despite accepting housing assistance, and the constant influx of low paying retail and food service jobs while nothing is done to address housing shortages. 

I just think the city isn’t run very well. Why did they put the Hard Rock right downtown? It killed the growing district of small restaurants and shops that were developing in the area, it attracts the worst of the city, the outdoor concert venue is extremely disruptive (I can hear concerts and I live a mile on the opposite side of Hamilton), and it destroyed the historical value of the area. And then the city approved the development of those lofts downtown. Idk how many have sold, but I’d never pay that much to live somewhere where the only nearby draw is a corporate casino and I have to listen to bands I don’t like late into the night all summer. 

Sioux City has good attributes. The location is great being so close to NE and SD with highway access to go to larger cities and other states, the riverfront is pleasant, there’s a lot of interesting historical sites, there’s a ton of creative people here, and it does smell better downtown than it used to. It’s just overshadowed by the difficulty finding (usually overpriced and rundown) housing, the bad roads, the thoughtless management, and the general trash ones that results from people not feeling like their city is working for them. I think there’s a feeling of hopelessness and apathy here in a lot of places and it’s a cycle that prevents improvement.",t2_57p3m2ji,we11_actually,0,1631305825.0,0,t1_hcctr9g,hcctr9g,True,Luiville18,t3_pl50wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/,Dear Sioux City,/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/hcctr9g/,2,r/siouxcity,0,2

"I lived in Sioux City from age 9 - 18.

At the time, I mostly resented my family issues but physical and emotional neglect also led to poor social skills, which made me feel like an outsider and my whole personality kind of developed around that. So of course I hated Sioux City because that was something else to blame for it all. However, looking back after having lived in many places, the weather sucked, there isn't really an ""outside"" to go to, and there isn't much to do for a teen other than activities sponsored through school, which as stated, I didn't feel that I was a part of. 

The pro's in hindsight were having good friends (as I got older), the food, lots of permissibility to run around being a heathen, and it was cheap to live there. But these are things we can't appreciate until we've grown up and lived in other towns and know to appreciate it.

All in all, it's too small for me to move back to. There's lot of great people but there's also a lot of gossips and nosy neighbors who need to get a life (if you don't believe me, just be aware that other towns don't have a facebook page dedicated to who got arrested and posts mugshots of everybody who did. that is some barbaric shit).",t2_fujv3,erehin,0,1631281651.0,0,t1_hcb7yul,hcb7yul,True,Luiville18,t3_pl50wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/,Dear Sioux City,/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/hcb7yul/,1,r/siouxcity,0,1
"Transplant here!

I love Sioux City! I grew up in a small town with nothing to do and then went to school in a big city with a ton to do and thought I would never leave. Then I had a family. We realized that when you have a family your priorities change. We have a nice home that would have been double the price where I used to live. We have all the amenities that a big city has (except Costco, we need that), and it's just the right size still where people/neighbors are friendly and helpful. 

Despite what other people that live here say, this is not a dangerous city and the crime is not bad. There isn't one place that I don't feel comfortable going to in this town. Plus, it's very interesting how diverse our neighborhoods are. One block will be pretty run down and the next block is beautiful mansions. That's very interesting. We do have some neighborhoods that are run down but every city does.

We have free museums, trails, parks, and other things to do if you actually look. Every single city/town has the same complaints about it as we do. Plus, we are fortunate enough to be close to Omaha and Sioux Falls if we do want to have a quick weekend getaway.

"Born and raised in Lincoln, NE, came to Sioux City about 3 years ago, so I figure my opinion ought to count for something on this question.

Sioux City, in my view, is a more working-class and hardscrabble city than Lincoln or Sioux Falls, which have far more white-collar-oriented economies.  Sioux City is more akin to Omaha in that regard: more factory, food service, blue-collar type of work.

Yeah, the meth is bad here, but something interesting about Sioux City is that it isn't quite as gentrified as other Midwestern cities I've visited.  In other words, I grant there are ""nicer"" and ""less nice"" areas here, but that division isn't as stark as in, say, Omaha or Lincoln.

Growing up in Lincoln, people my age (middle range Millenials) often complained that Lincoln was boring and that they wanted to move out of Lincoln.  Most of my friends have found their way back to Lincoln, one way or another.  I'm not sure how that much happens in Sioux City.

Sioux City has come to have a special place in my heart.  It's a rougher city than Lincoln, but I've come to like it here despite that.  I think there's plenty to do ... you just have to have more imagination.  Almost everywhere young people complain there's not enough to do.  That being said, it's dispiriting to see so many vacant commercial spaces downtown and across the town.

Anyhoo, just a transplant's .02 :)",t2_jszwp,ThatBloodyPinko,0,1631227188.0,0,t1_hc8mpyc,hc8mpyc,True,Luiville18,t3_pl50wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/,Dear Sioux City,/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/hc8mpyc/,12,r/siouxcity,0,12
"I feel like one thing I've noticed is that the things people complain about are pretty much the exact same complaints people make everywhere else and for some reason people in Sioux City act like we're the only ones suffering from those issues. Saying that there is a high crime rate and drug problem compared to other cities seems like a ridiculous claim when you factor in places like Atlanta or Seattle.

The only real legitimate claims come when people go outside of those norms. Admittedly, Sioux City is a bit lacking in things to do. We have an overabundance of bars, but not much for young adults to do aside from drinking, which thus in turn doesn't encourage new people to move here and join the community.

Yes, we have a sewage treatment facility, but that's barely noticeable unless you pass by it and smell it for all of 10-seconds if you're on the highway or floyd. Not really that big of a deal. Our water sucks, but that's pretty normal across the entire midwest. Just like how the entire midwest has higher Radium levels. It is what it is. Just like the weather changes, you choose what sort of weather you want to live through every year based on your region. You can't get mad when the weather is as expected just because it's not what you want.

Anyways, that's my two cents. I like it here. And I think the fact that we have a sort of tri-state connection and share a lot with South Sioux, Sgt Bluff, etc is pretty cool and beneficial in a lot of ways.",t2_orc52,Gorssky,0,1631223310.0,0,t1_hc8durs,hc8durs,True,Luiville18,t3_pl50wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/,Dear Sioux City,/r/siouxcity/comments/pl50wa/dear_sioux_city/hc8durs/,6,r/siouxcity,0,6

"I like Sioux City, but I can understand why some people don't. The water is horrid, the streets are falling apart and caving in. Heavy drug users, plenty of trashy people. The community is closed off until they get to know you. Trains are pains with loud blaring horns all hours of the day. Lots of right wing nuts, morons running red lights and stop signs, insane amount of insects, ridiculous humidity, rain, and wind. Nonstop cloudy skies. Snow shovelings winters. Most places close at 8-10pm. 

I could go on all day about the negatives.  


But I can also go on about the positives. Nice and green hills of trees and grass, lots of rivers and bridges, can get anywhere in town pretty quickly, very kind services and healthcare. Lots of jobs. Lakes everywhere for outdoor fun, get on boats and jetskis. Go fishing or hunting. Awesome Spring and Fall weather for barbecues and hanging out.

"Mystery solved by the gracious, knowledgeable, and talented Tom Munson, Archivist at the Sioux City Public Museum.  The photo was taken in Sioux City.  

Tom Wrote, ""your photo was absolutely taken in Sioux City. Your grandfather is standing on Pierce St. between 2nd and 3rd St. The photo is looking to the north. On the left is the east end of the Union Depot, the large warehouse in the background is the Moore-Shenkberg Grocery Co., and on the right is the West Hotel annex.""

Unfortunately, none of the buildings in the photo are still standing the big one on the left in the photo (the Moore-Shenkberg Grocery Co.) was demolished in 1982.  We were considering a trip out to recreate the picture 100 years later, but there is really nothing there to link the photos now.

"If you're coming down US-75, considering Bob's is on the list (& that's in LeMars; \~20 miles north)...  You might want to take Exit 99 & then head down Floyd Blvd (or stay on Business 75 & cut across Outer Drive) for a few options.

* Jim's Burgers -- There's one in LeMars as well (just a block from Bob's Drive In), but they typically carry typical American Diner fare with some Mexican options.
   * Jim's Burgers website -- [https://www.jimsburgersiowa.com/](https://www.jimsburgersiowa.com/)
* Pizza Ranch -- This is probably a more ""safe"" option with kids as it's a Pizza & Chicken buffet (w/ soft-serve ice cream in the desert section).
   * Pizza Ranch website -- [https://pizzaranch.com/](https://pizzaranch.com/)
* Koi Express -- This is located at the end of the strip mall on Floyd before Casey's (where Taco Bell use to be).  It's Japanese cuisine (Sushi, Tempura, Ramen, ect.) & prices are bit higher than other places (expect to spend at least $10 / person, excluding drink).  The Teriyaki Rice Bowls & Noodle Bowls are good & filling.
   * Koi Express website -- [http://www.koifloydblvd.com/](http://www.koifloydblvd.com/)

If you're willing to hit an exit for the Singing Hills area (going from US-75 to I-29 South... or take Business 75 south through town), a few places to check out (around the intersection for WalMart) would be...

* Culver's -- A bit fast-casual American fare (a little slower, but generally higher quality compared to McDonald's)
   * Culver's Menu -- [https://www.culvers.com/menu-and-nutrition](https://www.culvers.com/menu-and-nutrition)
* Fazoli's -- This is relatively new franchise in the area (opened Feb., 2021) which is quick italian (more casual than Olive Garden).  They do offer unlimited breadsticks for dine-in customers.  They have a value lunch menu ($6 / person), but you can run about $12 with a premium meal (like Loaded Fettuccine) combo (includes pizza slice or salad + small drink).
   * Fazoli's Online Menu -- [https://fazolis.com/menu](https://fazolis.com/menu)

I'll admit that my recommendations might not be as adventurous as some more local options, but I'm just considering options that are fairly easy to locate from the Highway & Interstate without having to drive a couple of miles in-town (like those on Hamilton Blvd, unless you're coming into Sioux City from there... or willing to travel to the end of Outer Drive to reach it).  I'm more a regional suburbanite (working in Sioux City, living outside the metro area), so my knowledge of restaurants are more general than others.

If you are new to golf Floyd and Sun Valley are great. Floyd only has 3 par 5’s and par 4’s. The rest of the course is reasonably easy par 3’s. Some of the greens can be a pain.

"Drivers need to be approved and added for each different zone. Being across state lines, Dunes/N Sioux are technically in the Sioux Falls zone. S Sioux I believe is in the Omaha zone. Different zones have different pay rates and occasionally different requirements. Unless the drivers went out of their way with support to get added to Sioux Falls, it's not gonna happen.

Myself, I drove in the SF and SC zones due to living in N Sioux, they had added me to SF first and I was added to SC as a subsequent option. Unfortunately, I live in SF now and don't drive anymore.

Just for an example, Uber has it available on their site (on my partner portal) the maps for each. I'll show you how far they extend this stuff in the Midwest. I believe Lyft is the same zoning, or similar at least.

Besides spending maybe an hour at the Hard Rock, I really can't think of much else to do here if someone is visiting me. I'd probably suggest a trip to Omaha if my visitors were going to be here for more than just overnight.

"1. Ponca State Park is a great place to visit. It's quite beautiful and the closest thing northeast Nebraska has to a forest. Good hiking and camping out there.
2. Niobrara State Park is about two hours away. Its more wide open than Ponca but is quite beautiful the scenery is quite fun. You can also do some boating out there too I think. Its also relatively close to Ashfall Fossil Beds in Royal, which is a place where they found skeletons of prehistoric rhinos and three toed horses. It's quite fun. Also if you don't mind trespassing a bit you can check out the abandoned Devil's Nest Resort near Crofton.
3. I think there is canoeing and ""tanking"" on the Elkhorn river close to Omaha.
4. Lake Okoboji is always pretty fun though it's basically the party riviera of Iowa, but there are spots to kayak and bike.
5. I'm not as familiar with the Yankton area outside of Niobrara Nebraska but I'm sure there are some fun things to do with the dam and the lake right there.
6. It's a little far, but for biking, I'd think Dolliver State Park just east of Fort Dodge might be a fun longer drive.
7. Blue Mound up near Luverne MN has a pretty good trail. There's also Lake Shetek between Worthington and Marshall MN which is more like 2 1/2 hours but still close enough. My family loves going there. You can rent kayaks or swim and its a nice place to bike.
8. Falls Park in Sioux Falls would be a fun place to bike. There's also Newton Hills State Park and Palisades State Park that are relatively close.
9. In Sioux City itself there's Bacon Creek, Stone Park, Adams Preserve in North Sioux, and South Sioux has a bike trail that goes around the whole town.
10. The Loess Hills State Forest is near Pisgah and has some great hiking trails. Preparation Canyon State Park is also next door. Its a fun area to explore. Plus the Loess Hills are super beautiful.
11. The last I can think of is the Omaha area with Hitchcock Nature center in Council Bluffs, Fontanelle Forest in Bellevue, Platte River State Park near Louisville, Mahoney State Park near Ashland.",t2_4qroh0y6,hasbeenwriting,0,1621030374.0,0,t1_gy5hkfy,gy5hkfy,True,kkx124,t3_mx61oq,https://www.reddit.com/r/siouxcity/comments/mx61oq/best_outdoor_activities_within_2_hour_drive_of/,Best outdoor activities within 2 hour drive of Sioux City,/r/siouxcity/comments/mx61oq/best_outdoor_activities_within_2_hour_drive_of/gy5hkfy/,2,r/siouxcity,0,2
