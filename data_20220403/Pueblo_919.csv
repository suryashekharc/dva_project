This happens in colorado springs too. They send you to specialists. Or someone that can assist you better. This is not abnormal.  As for voting against their best interests?

"We were iffy about pueblo after listening to what others had to say. After doing my own research and traveling around different towns we decided to take the chance. We are so happy we did! There seems to be a lot of opinions coming from people who have never lived here or have even been down this way. If you do enough research you'll see that swat team occurrence in southern colorado springs is not abnormal. It's a pueblo-hating bandwagon. It's a very family-oriented community and everyone is very friendly.

We saw worse in colorado springs to be quite honest. It's a smaller town than colorado springs so the community is extremely diligent when it comes to crime. I saw even weirder things in Aurora and Denver. I think it's overblown by a long shot. I can't help to think it might be because it is so diverse. Even the nicest neighborhoods in southern California had crime and things stolen from them.

Here there is hiking, festivals, a zoo, parks, a cute old downtown, food, etc. There is even a college! I love the unique victorian homes and old architecture. I'd look at multiple crime maps and decide from there which area is the best. There are some maps around this sub that are helpful in your search. I think it does need some love but this town is old, unique, and full of potential. It is changing in so many ways while keeping its old history and charm. I think more amenities are inevitable, pueblo is growing rapidly.

Pueblo's great. I didn't expect to like it as much as I do, but I do. Great food, everything is *much* cheaper than in a bigger city, a much stronger sense of community than anywhere else I've lived, including the ""deliberate communities"", and the crime..?

"Pueblo has the worst healthcare I have ever experienced. If anyone in your family has a health issue, don’t move here. Specialists routinely tell me that my condition is “too complicated” for them and tell me to find a doctor in Denver. The hospitals and their ER’s are a joke and mostly either release you without care or transfer you to Denver. I hope to God I don’t have an emergency and need surgery while I’m still living here - I actually am moving due to lack of quality health care, I have a chronic disease but it’s not fatal and these Pueblo doctors went to med school just like Denver doctors. There’s no excuse for them just to reject anyone they deem “complicated.” They’ve made my life complicated by forcing me to commute 2+ hours for routine healthcare. I’ve had several family members who have also been told by doctors that they can’t help them and go to Denver and also several other family members transported to Denver for fairly routine things like a broken hip or pneumonia. 

Aside from that, lots of drug problems,
shootings, and car thefts. Also, I’ve never seen as many Mexican Trump-lovers in my life - talk about voting against your own best interests!  This district elected Boebert. That says it all. 

Last thing: I’ve joined several groups to try to improve things like the roads (freaking terrible - potholes the size of refrigerators everywhere) and food banks. I’ve been told by dozens that if I don’t like the way things are, I should leave and move to a city! WTF? They get offended and pissy if you try to improve things. 

Also, snakes. Ugh. They’re everywhere and they’re big and scary.

"Honestly it's nuts but don't move to Pueblo, move to Pueblo West. Pueblo has it's issues that Pueblo West does not and we have amazing people running our town other than the water district that seem to just hack everything up and not have a clue. 

I live with my wife and daughter close to the race track. We do have mixed families here but not many, it is getting much better though however, our district has high marks and is truly a melting pot that focuses solely on the kids in everything they do (bus garage does have it's issues with management though.. student first I think..)

 As for being an electrician pueblo west is a perfect spot for you! A lot out here are contractors, easy side work out here too and you are between pueblo, springs, and canon city for work which is versatile. I did HVAC for a while and almost had my company start an office down here solely for me so we could expand here, I was supposed to operate independently down here. If you are adventurous it's more of a drive per se but one other things. The further north and east you are the rougher the wind till houses build the area up. It's routine for us to average 40-50mph winds through winter. It's absolutely amazing here though when summer hits. Lizards and birds everywhere, hawks here and there the size of small cars! Lake San Isabel and Pueblo isn't too far for good fishing either and boating.

Here's the fun part.. CRIME.. well, we have virtually none to be honest. People here and there do have cameras up too though and so do we mainly to monitor our pool since we have no fence yet (not code here which was great for our daughter) I have motion sensors set to alert me via text and in on my desktop, wife's desktop, and the server. We do get quite a few dumped cars though. Mainly along Purcell and so far in 3 years only one dumped in front of the empty lot next to us.

There will be snakes, and you will have migrating tarantulas too. We do get a slight amount of hail but really not much. Weather is iffy most of the time and swings wildly unless it's summer or summer slightly into fall. Lots out here are pretty big as well if you guys have any pets (we have 5 dogs).

Along with fishing and hiking there's plenty to do in town. We have a river walk with paddle boats, theres places with live bands, we have a pretty big nightlife scene if you guys do that, I'd say stay away from Walmart for food down here (they are often unstocked and veggies/fruits sit too long on the shelves and start rotting) the Safeway, Albertsons, and King Soopers here are the way to go.

As for weather too summer it stays hot all the time. We have tons of sun (over 300 days) if you put up solar it's a great offset as we have net metering too, if you ride motorcycles there are also lots of great places to ride too and you can ride year round here if you want to.

"I'm born and raised in Pueblo, lived here for almost 30 years.

The public school system is a hot mess.  Home schoolers are mostly just conservative religious nuts.  Most social services are underfunded.  We had a massive influx of homeless/transient people around 2015.  Now there are panhandlers on every corner in busy parts of town - I'd never seen anything like that.  There are more drugs, more crime.  The community college is really nice, the university is really struggling financially and I wouldn't recommend them to anyone - but they're cheap, so there's that.  Most young people leave.  Most educated people leave.  Executives and high officials live in Colorado Springs and drive to Pueblo.

Politically I would say most people are moderate to liberal.  We used to be a big union town when the mill was running at capacity and owned by CF&I.  The old conservative white people are a minority, but they're a loud minority.  Pueblo has over half its population of Hispanic/Latino descent, the Chicano movement was big here before I was born, as were labor rights for migrant farm workers.

It's not a bad place.  But it's worse than it was 10 years ago, and much worse than it was 20 years ago.

I have only ever lived here.  I'm looking to move away.  Everyone who comes to Pueblo from out of state tells me vehemently how shitty Pueblo is.  Is the outside really that great?  I can't wait to see.

The way I see it - Pueblo really does have all the basics you need.  If you don't mind the schools and know how to be safe, it's fine.  However anyone from here can see it's going downhill.  Huge buildings near busy roads lay vacant for years, even decades.  People want to leave.  There's not a lot to do for young people.  The homeless population is getting bigger and bigger - my dad got jumped on his way out of King Soopers in the afternoon, I nearly got jumped coming out of iHop in the evening.

I recommend moving to Colorado Springs if you can afford to, even fountain.  If you really need to be around here, I recommend Pueblo West.

Pueblo people are some of the dumbest and most ignorant people you may find.  People are generally apathetic or ignorant about issues.  The median household and individual income are super low here.  1/4 Puebloans live in Poverty.

Don't drive a fancy car around.  Don't leave empty TV boxes out by the trash.

"Good synopsis.  Just wanted to chime in regarding race/ethnicity.  The majority of Pueblo is Hispanic, which makes it more similar to this region of Colorado (S and SW).  In the last census, Hispanic people (including White and non-White Hispanics) were 49.2%, while White (non-Hispanic) was 42.9%.

"I grew up in Pueblo, moved to the east coast for 6ish years and moved back to raise my kids near family. A lot of “good” neighborhoods are just a few blocks from the “bad”. 1.5 miles from me are $1M+ homes and 1mile in the opposite direction is a trailer park. For the most part Pueblo West reminds me of what it was like growing up on the southside 40 years ago. While house prices may be less than Springs they have risen significantly over the last few years. As an electrician you should be able to get in with the local IBEW fairly easily to get work or check with Black Hills, they’re also union. As far as demographics it’s predominantly white with a high percentage of Hispanic(me) but lower Black population.
And yes there are some extreme right and left voters with their flags and signs but Pueblo has always been a primarily democratic county. Trump has made public racism acceptable among his flock. If you have kids, District 70 does have better funding and happier teachers than District 60 (we’ve been in both). And there are actually a lot of things to do and restaurants that are local beyond PassKey and Burritos Betty. Some favorite places, Pueblo Zoo, Reservoir, Riverwalk(movies in the park are fun), Mess Drive in and restaurants Angelo’s, Tocayo, Rocco’s Deli, Pho50, Shamrock, and so many.

"We've lived in Pueblo for the past 28 years, and it has chanegd quite a bit since we first moved here.  Crime and homelessness have gone up, but they are nowehere near as bad as in the larger cities.  Pueblo used to be extremely affordable, but that's changing, too.  There is definitely a lot of diversity, and I don't feel unsafe at all in my neighborhood.

With that having been said, I think it's still a nice place to live.  There are some really good local (non-chain) restaurants with great food.  Outdoor options are plenty within a few hours drive, and there are a lot of nice activities in town.  The Riverwalk downtown is cool, with some nice restaurants/cafes nearby.  I personally love the Nature Center with all of the trails, and Lake Pueblo/Arkansas River provides some fun water activities.

I have to disagree with a few points someone made downthread.  The schools are good (depends on the neighborhood and the parents of the kids!) and Pueblo is not a big Republican town.  The city itself pretty much swings Democratic every election, but the surrounding county is blue.

Honestly I am trying to leave Pueblo because I don’t want to raise my daughter here. I grew up here and love the town but everyone here is just so narrow minded. There’s is no growth and will always be the way it is. Nothing ever changes. I go to other small towns and see how much growth they have had and Pueblo just never catches up.

"Grew up in the suburbs of Kansas city which are great. Lived in Memphis for a few years which is a racist, crime-ridden shithole.

Been here for 6 years. We love it. 

Pueblo doesn't have all the amenities and the schools aren't great. But as a whole Colorado has an absolutely terrible education system. Cost of living is decent and housing was affordable before the pandemic. 

I work at the Pueblo airport and live in the southwest side of town. I can't be further away from the airport and still be in city limits. Takes me 25 minutes to get to work. The traffic and roads are the reason we didn't look for a home in the springs. 

Tons of cheap and free things to do with kids. Riverwalk is nice. Farms are fun. 

To all the people above that disparaged Trump supporters, I've seen a lot more ""left loonies"" here. Politics are stupid and the people that take them seriously are usually annoying no matter which side they are on. Although that house that has a confederate flag out front located on Lincoln/thatcher near the community College is a bit out of place. 

The bad crime is mainly located on the east side of town around 4th street. 

Can't stand Pueblo West. More expensive, cookie cutter homes or no conformity, city planning is nonexistent, traffic sucks. 

Job market is a bit rough. Seems like you're minimum wage, blue collar, or one of few well paying professionals.

"Wow, I haven't had the same experience as others. I moved here a little over 5 years ago. I've lived in several towns and cities. I feel safer in Pueblo than I did in Dallas. 

I think the CSU-PUEBLO campus is nice. Their placement on the edge of town feels odd but I guess that gives them more options and a sense of safetyfor their students... we are seeing way more publicity from them so they seem to be doing a revitalization plan. PCC is located in the older but more affluent area so its campus is very pretty. The primary and secondary schools have varying reputations. But that would be true for any city this size.

I like that its a city without it being as packed as Springs or Denver and much less expensive. However the cost was shocking coming from TX. But I've seen far less racism here than in TX. I'm also in a mixed race relationship. I don't think I've even noticed anyone looking at us here but TX is a whole other story.

Yes, there are a lot of Trump flags but honestly, not enough to say this is a Republican town. But maybe my barometer is a little higher coming from the south. 

Every city has its issues. Pueblo is not perfect. But what it lacks is nearby. It makes a date night feel a bit more special when we want food thats not here but in Springs - meaning it feels like more of an event. We have enough of the basics that I don't mind a monthly trip to Springs for occasional fun. 

For safety perspective, I'm female in my 40s. I'm not stupid. I don't put myself in harms way but again, maybe my barometer is different having lived in much larger cities. Maybe if I had only leaved in a rural community that only dealt with a few ""bad"" families while overlooking the prominent white families' indiscretions, I might feel different about Pueblo.

I only hear gunshots around holidays in my neighborhood. We have a few Trump fanatics in the neighborhood but other than that, it is a very diverse and quiet area (Belmont area). I don't socialize with neighbors much but we wave and smile.

"I've spent a few years each in Pueblo, Colorado Springs, and Fountain and some more years out of state.

I can't presume which ethnicities you are (in regards to being ""mixed"") but Pueblo is like most everywhere else in Colorado in that it has a very low black population. The hispanic population is, in my experience, larger than Fountain or the Springs, but Pueblo remains predominantly white.

The affordability *is* nice, but the housing market is going just as crazy there as it is everywhere else and inflation is causing prices to rise quickly in Pueblo, just like everywhere else.

I lived in a reasonably decent part of Pueblo, not the best/most expensive neighborhood, but kinda in the middle. I heard gunshots basically every night (generally speaking, I can tell the difference between a gunshot, a car backfire, and fireworks). I rarely heard sirens, so police either responded quietly or not at all.

**THE BAD**  
Pueblo has very, very little in regards to amenities that larger cities have, and what it does have is poorly run. The fast food restaurants seemed to not taste as good as when I'd go meet family in the Springs (e.g. the best McDonald's in Pueblo is average in the Springs). Asian restaurants (Chinese, Indian, Sushi etc.) in town are mediocre at best. Even local Mexican food is not as impressive as I was lead to believe it was. The few quality restaurants in town are usually expensive and, again, don't compare to similarly expensive food in a larger city. Worse: locals don't seem to understand what I mean when I make these complaints. They seem to recommend high *value* restaurants where the food is boring but the prices are low. Every time someone asks in this subreddit about where to eat in Pueblo it's always Burritos Betty, Papa Jose's, Pass Key and so on. It's not that these restaurants are bad, its that they aren't really the best Pueblo has to offer. They are what the locals eat: cheap, filling, decent food. Not what I'd recommend to someone I want to leave Pueblo with a good impression. There is only 1 movie theater that is almost always packed and understaffed, the mall in town is dying a painful death like all malls, the big box stores are smaller than elsewhere, and the grocery stores have struggled to keep stock during the pandemic: I'd occasionally have to drive to the Springs to get groceries. Speaking of groceries, there is only 1 tiny, rundown, organic food store, if that's your thing. If you have kids, the schools in town are not great, nor is the Pueblo campus of Colorado State University, but I've heard good things about the local community college. Local drivers were some of the worst I've ever been forced to drive around, getting to the point that I avoided driving unless absolutely necessary. Had 1 person accuse me of cutting them off and then pull a gun on me when I explained my side of things. People regularly stop when they don't have to in order to wave ahead someone who was legally required to stop. People drive below the limit in both lanes and speed up if you try to get around them. All of these things happen everywhere, of course, but I swear they happen *much* more once you are in Pueblo county.

**THE GOOD**  
If you love the great outdoors but don't need to be close to the mountains and don't mind the heat, Pueblo is *awesome*. The reservoir is beautiful and well kept, there are plenty of parks and most of them are decent and have playgrounds that the kids seem to really enjoy. The Zoo is nice, small, but an impressive collection of animals and very well kept, I rather enjoyed going there. The restaurants in town that *are* good are not franchises and don't really advertise, you will need to ask around and try places in order to find what you like. The river walk is pretty and stuffed with romantic restaurants and other diversions, these restaurants are pricey, but usually good quality.

**THE POLITICS**  
Pueblo is a heavily Republican town, lots of Trump fanatics with 2 flags on their car, ""thin blue line"" propaganda everywhere, stuff like that. If this is what you're looking for, great, otherwise, be prepared to see it *constantly.* I ran into a surprising amount of racists who thought it was okay to just be openly racist. Some friends got run out of a bar by a gang who didn't take kindly to the black guy that was in the group. A woman demanded the same black guy get up and change seats when he sat next to her at the bar of Olive Garden.",t2_h5wbi,JaxFirehart,0,1648916453.0,0,t1_i34f8xu,i34f8xu,True,North0House,t3_tukncn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pueblo/comments/tukncn/honest_opinions_on_pueblo_from_some_locals_i_want/,Honest opinions on Pueblo from some locals?

"There are definitely neighborhoods that are worse for crime than others. So depending where you live, you will probably be fine.

I doubt anything will ever come of it.  I preferred chile fest in 2020 when I went super early in the morning.  It was a complete shitshow last year with how many people were there.  Not to mention there was a broad daylight shooting on the bridge by Angelo's shortly after I had left.  Grabbing your bushel of peppers from the farms is pretty solid.  The fest was .....alright.... but then again a fest is what you make of it.  They had some reasonably priced tequila shots surprisingly lol.

After that, it's a property-owner expense. Also, if you live in the site and have kids, please please please be careful about how they interact with soil - lead is a serious neurotoxin and especially affects kids' brain development.

Besides kids, another reason to have testing and a cleanup done is that it opens up the possibility to sell the property (the difficulties of non-remediated properties transacting is mentioned in the article). Without a clean letter from the EPA following remediation, or testing that shows your property was clean to begin with, you will struggle to find a bank willing to finance a buyer, so will be limited to cash buyers and lowered property values.

"Less than $20 a month for heating ur 2000’ home with today’s prices? Sounds unbelievable. 

$400/month for heating ur home with electric? Electric what? Can’t be a high efficiency heat pump…

These numbers don’t add up. 

Fossil fuel prices are skyrocketing and renewables (particularly solar) are getting cheaper every year. Just look at Evraz (the steel mill) that just switched to 100% solar. That’s not some marketing gimmic, it was the cheapest option available.

"Electrification doesn't necessarily mean resistive heating.  Heat pumps are gaining in adoption.

For example, Samsung already sells an affordable ventless heat pump dryer that uses a fraction of the electricity of a normal dryer: https://www.homedepot.com/p/Samsung-4-0-cu-ft-24-in-Stackable-Ventless-Electric-Heat-Pump-Dryer-in-White-DV22N6800HW/307685530

"From what I've heard, there's a few vocal NIMBY's among the adjacent neighbors.  

The NIMBY-ism is silly, imho, because 

1. The site had reasonable expectation of being an industrial site.  It's in an industrial area. 
2. Solar is better than the emissions from either Comanche or the steel mill.  Last I looked there's measurable, existing soil pollution from industrial activity in that area.  Solar panels don't cause those kinds of problems.  
3. It's a lot quieter than any other use.  I remember when Unit 3 first turned on how outrageously noisy it was, for months, during the night in the county.  
4. The existing site is dusty, in poor ecological condition, and fairly ugly.  
5. Pueblo is going to grow.  There's no reasonable expectation that this empty property was going to remain undeveloped forever.  The site isn't national forest. 
6. We need renewables.  This is the perfect site.   
7. Comanche is going away in the future.  We need to replace it, and its tax revenues, with something.

I looked at houses in that neighborhood in 2012 and I expected it to be developed.

"Great story!  Some quotes are provided below for a TL;DR summary.   


""An unlikely team of disparate companies, public officials, and local residents came together on a steel mill dating from the 1800s to make it the first in the world powered largely by solar.""  


""EVRAZ needed affordable energy. Xcel needed carbon-free power. Pueblo needed to keep its industry and the jobs and tax base that came with it.""  


""Xcel Energy, Colorado’s largest power provider, had been supplying electricity to the mill complex from three coal plants – Comanche 1, 2, and 3. The prices tended to be high and also inconsistent. ""  


“We had to find a way to make this work, or we stood the chance of losing the steel mill.” says Terry Hart, a county commissioner at the time.   


""Pueblo is among several winners, as are efforts to address climate change. Coal has basically been eliminated from the mill. The third Comanche coal plant still running the mill and online only since 2010 now is to be retired in 2034 – 36 years ahead of schedule. Combine those carbon savings with the solar power and savings from mined iron and coal no longer needed, and the mill will produce 1/30th the carbon it might have otherwise.""",t2_eie1ptl,MetalAlchemist303,0,1645734508.0,0,t1_hyadnmg,hyadnmg,True,HazyRay,t3_sw1ypw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pueblo/comments/sw1ypw/a_tale_of_two_steel_mills_and_yet_theyre_the_same/,"A tale of two steel mills, and yet they’re the same one",/r/pueblo/comments/sw1ypw/a_tale_of_two_steel_mills_and_yet_theyre_the_same/hyadnmg/,1,r/pueblo,0,1

"Thank you, u/jaredpolis. Your response solidified you lost my and my family's vote. 

I'll ask you again. What are you personally doing to help those Coloradans in financial ruin as a direct result of you?

For those ""good jobs,"" did the employees feel the same? Does an employee see their boss or employer as some benevolent corporate overlord when the employee is effectively chained to their desk in order to pay their mortgage and afford healthcare? How did the analysts, accountants, and staff who worked for you feel as they worked long hours preparing for the sale of your businesses or IPO, when you exploited the value of their labor to personally profit hundreds of times over anything those employees would ever recognize?

How can we trust someone like you, addicted to corporate greed and power, to represent and lead? You feel no effects of rising inflation or higher taxes. Some cut meat from their diet to save on grocery bills, some may keep a thermostat to 60 in the winter to save on utilities. 

The massive conflict of interest of your wealth and representing the people is disgusting. The people who are truly in need of a leader cannot trust you to act with urgency and common sense to pass legislation in their best interests. 

My family's vote doesn't matter. You're a rich politician in Colorado with a D after your name.

"Hello Governor Polis,

Would you be willing to work with other governors, or perhaps even initiate, a process to either create or improve free public-source textbooks for K-12 and colleges that promote fact and evidence-based learning, and teach the scientific method?  

While I do not this know for certain, I think that if multiple states were to work together, this would help fix some of the problems caused by catering to special interests seeking to revise—or even hide—important things like science education and history.

Last year, the whole cryptocurrency space (from Bitcoin all the way down to the smallest scam coin), in general, grew by 187.5%, and averages growth of 113% per year. Is it pointless and fake? Sure.

"I see some *small* solutions, but to what problem?  The US Dollar may be valuable only by community consensus, but it has the very important advantage that people actually find it valuable.  People get scammed with their credit card, but there is fraud protection there that doesn't exist in cryptoland.  Civil forfeiture is such an edge case that it's not going to send the masses over (if anything, that angle may backfire because ""it helps criminals!"")

I can only think about ordinary people like my wife, parents, boss, etc.  Nobody I know (including myself) is so unhappy with their banks that they want to change that part of the system entirely.  Maybe the politics of how wealth is distributed, but crypto doesn't change that.  I can think of Henry Ford's ""if I asked the people what they wanted, they'd say a better horse"" quote, but there just isn't anything crypto can offer that improves normal people's day to day life.

"I think 95% of crypto is useless and a waste of money and resources. But I do believe there are some great cryptocurrencies. For example, Hex is a certificate of deposit, where you can lock your investment and get a percent return. 
Etherium and PulseChain are the platforms that most all other coins are built upon. 
As for why crypto has any value at all? Lol, Because it really is fake! It is because we have all collectively agreed that it has a value. And if you think about the US dollar, which is no longer backed by gold, we have collectively agreed that it is valuable. Theoretically, we could all say that the US dollar is worthless now.
Here are some reasons why I think crypto is important:
Many coins are literally just immutable code. A block of code that is released into the internet/blockchain and will be alive forever more. No one can mess with it, not even governments. It is forever unchangeable.
Many coins/tokens will never inflate, and some are even deflationary. Imagine how valuable a US dollar would be if they never printed new ones! It’s cool to think that some coins will never have any more supply than they do now.
Crypto makes traveling with money easy. Many banks are not nationwide, and certainly not global. You don’t have to worry about getting robbed by people, or the police with Civil Asset Forfeitures.

"I had this conversation with someone on Reddit once. They claimed that crypto wasn't a currency, it was an asset (or something like that, I could easily be twisting their words only because I can't remember them!) but assets have some kind of utility to them. Food, energy, production, capital... Stuff like that. Stocks are pieces of companies producing things. The ones that are good at producing things, or have the potential to, are generally worth more. Land can be used to build things, or to grow stuff, or camp on... Whatever. The land that's better for money-making purposes are generally worth more.

I really don't see any utility with crypto as I would stocks, property, or anything else. Feel free to correct me here. But people do use it to buy things... So I guess that makes it a currency? Thing is, what problem needed to be solved for us to have a totally different currency? I hear about decentralization, getting away from government control, etc... But what will drive 99% of the population to ditch their banks and move to the world of crypto, which has an ever-fluctuating value?

"Just to expand on your question for the governor, and hopefully he does respond to these questions and not just the comments praising his tenure, I would add the following questions: 

Since there is a housing emergency, especially for those looking to purchase ""starter"" homes, which largely don't exist anywhere anymore, what are the plans to provide affordable housing for the people of Colorado?

And, to be clear, affordable housing means housing that a person making median income (~$80k/year in most areas) or less can afford. So, assuming the $80k number, that means a household has about $5k a month of income after taxes. Since 1/3rd of income towards housing is considered the standard, that would mean the maximum price of an affordable house would be a house with a maximum monthly payment of $1,600.

Also, there have been a significant investment in housing (both rental and permanent) by investors --- primarily through private equity groups. The continual cycle of flipping apartment complexes/houses has led to increased rents since new private equity buyers pay more than the previous purchaser, and therefore have to increase rents to make their targeted return on the investments.

It's gotten extremely hard to live in Colorado, rent and home prices are through the roof and it forces locals into bad situations. What is the actual plan with this to have an impact.

Renewable energy: is there any threat to meet metering in any way? We installed solar this year too but may have to get rid of it and eat a loss because we won't get the rebate back for 2 years. Yea.. any plans to help with cost and the push to renewable sources?

Internet: providers in Colorado have decided radio wireless is the way to go, it's shoddy and unreliable like starlink. Many Coloradoans are stuck with century link, many times even in cities your only stuck with a 3-5mbps connection. What is being done to provide Coloradoans with a true wired option that can support working from home, 2 adults and a child in school, etc..?  Cost isn't an issue but options are massively and century link hasn't done anything to invest in Colorado and even got sued for shady practice

Safety and roads: road clearing has become very bad. This last storm sand being dumped did nothing with freezing. In other states and countries this doesn't happen. That being said, the sand in the road creates a hazard for other drivers especially motorcyclists. The state doesn't clean up the roads that is done to and should be legally liable. On exit 108 in Pueblo at the intersection under the states jurisdiction, road signs and mirrors were removed. Since then that intersection had increased accidents and frequently people blow the stop sign coming off the highway only to almost hit people coming under the bridge. There are plans for this intersection but the removal of the mirrors to be able to see around the corners has made it stupidly unsafe. Along with this the intersection of Purcell and I-50. Again the states jurisdiction. With the work going on you have failed to alter the light or make appropriate accomodations to see. The lanes are offset at the stop sign to go to Safeway and frequently the turn lane good up to the point where you can't see oncoming traffic. In two instances DOT has made bad decisions that are putting Coloradoans at risk when risk can be mitigated. Do you have plans to address unsafe actions from the DOT? There's more than just this for instances too.

Schools: and the biggest question. Teachers are getting doxxed, teachers are getting low pay, most Colorado schools don't even rate average, the state schools are massively struggling due to poor professor quality, then you have jeffco and Dougco.. wtf?! What are the plans with education across the state? It's completely in shambles. As one entering the field I'm ashamed of our state.

"I hope you're right Governor, but I fear we're not doing enough.

I'm familiar with that Voltz podcast. Will Toor is a faithful, well spoken, and competent director of the Colorado Energy Office. And here he is posting to Twitter in November of last year:

""For folks interested in an overview of the all of government effort to meet Colorado's climate targets, this draft report from CDPHE gives a pretty complete picture: [https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1P4hNczElJHTMfrPfp705MZ-mjbwawl3Z](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1P4hNczElJHTMfrPfp705MZ-mjbwawl3Z) ""

Yet the cited report omits disclosing the progress made towards reducing GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector, responsible for 20.26 MMT CO2e of our 126 MMT of total emissions in 2019. Why?

Can you assure concerned constituents that emissions will go down from the oil and gas sector over your second term — despite an increase in overall production?  And shouldn't our State's GHG Reduction Roadmap account for the emissions of our exported oil and gas?

Advocate argue these are examples of accounting tricks used to obfuscate responsibility for curbing GHG emissions from oil and gas produced in Colorado, be they emitted inside our borders or beyond.

"Copied from a previous reply, but just to add some areas beyond your search:

Good areas with reasonable housing prices: S side (State Fair, South Central have many nice blocks and are affordable) but skip within a couple blocks N or S of Northern Ave and avoid Superfund site (E of Spruce and N of Northern - mostly within Bessemer), near Northside like E of Francisco and S of 24th and W of I-25 (North Central on the map), and The Blocks/Mesa Junction/Orman Park. Sunset and Belmont are nice, too, newer housing stock but different and less historical flavor (70s-onward instead of 1890s-1940s like the other areas mentioned). 

For a step up in expense but really nice neighborhoods within the city, look in Aberdeen or North Elizabeth, or for newer, nice neighborhoods at the edge of the city, Camino or Regency. Goodnight has lots of nice houses but kinda 'edge of town' feel to it as well. 

Use [this map](http://www.justinholman.com/2014/05/14/pueblo-neighborhoods-1-0/) to find those named areas. 

**However**, as others have mentioned, Pueblo's neighborhoods are not really monolithically one thing or another - throughout town, in all but the newest developments, there are typically a lot of mixed vibes *within* neighborhoods, and you can have shacks across from huge nice Victorian homes, or a block in a rough area with extremely well-kept homes and nice neighbors who've lived there forever. Highly variable, so do your own diligence on any property you are looking to buy. In general, if it looks like a nice street, it is, and if it doesn't, well, decide how much you want to play the odds for a good deal. 

Overall, Pueblo's a pretty decent town - not paradise, but lots to enjoy here and I've found most people are friendly. It does have a laid-back, slower pace of life like a smaller town, and does not have the density or rush of a real city (feels much slower and smaller than CO Springs, which it is, but honestly doesn't even feel like other cities of 110k pop).

"The circled area encompasses several neighborhoods in Pueblo—some of which are more desirable than others.

I’d encourage you to drive around if you’re planning to visit (or even use street view on google maps) because some of the streets/neighborhoods in the area you’ve circled can be a bit rougher—particularly the further south and East you go.

"It's not a long list but it's a daunting one.

* County landfill improvements or new landfill/environmental processing center. This ties into the overabundance of subpar waste services, which as a social service, is not meant to be ran as a for-profit organization. Studies have explored this relationship between the urbanization of municipal waste management services and their financial viability. The research supports a social service based system with environmental responsibility and community outreach as it's main goals with budget concerns second.
* More integration with state resources with regard to education policy, homeless peoples management, crisis services, cybersecurity policy and procedure, as well as infrastructure development. Pueblo has staunchly rejected or stood apart from state efforts on multiple fronts in the past. It is still an issue with Pueblo, where we recently vetoed the mayors requested mask mandate. This is a step backwards and further codifies the ""Pueblo"" stereotype,
* Ending the service monopolies. Black Hills, Excel, and Comcast all need to be fairly competed against before Pueblo can transition to the future it deserves. Municipal utility programs have time and again shown through their results and the data presented by studies on economic progress and social sciences. The steps involved would create thousands of permanent jobs, a more competitive service environment, the ability to control local tax investiture in our economy, and the transparency of being accountable to the local electorate all provide situations which improve Pueblo citizens lives.

"PW does feel very suburban sprawly. It has very low density and as a result is extremely car-dependent. Lots of commercial dev along US-50, splits PW roughly in half north/south. That said, no way to get to the airport from anywhere in town without driving, but to get to a store, restaurant, bar, library, etc from just about anywhere in PW, it means a drive. This is not true for many neighborhoods (not all) in the city of Pueblo itself - much more going on at a higher density. Pretty windy out in PW, too.

Pros of PW are the relative space and quiet and the views. Most houses are on .5ac+ lots, and plenty on an acre or more. Prices still pretty affordable. It has grown quicker than the city, def not stagnant (neither is the city, though). 
Think it's a matter of preference. I would never live out there since what it offers doesn't line up with my priorities but I know many people who love it. I also know people who left after growing up there and much prefer to live in the city.

"Congrats on your job! Lots of people do one or the other - live in Pueblo, work in Springs, or vice versa. There are plenty of reasons to do both. 

Some I have heard for living in Springs and working in Pueblo: 
 
- Better/more school options in Springs if you have kids
 
- Better/more nightlife, restaurants, cultural stuff in Springs (it's a much larger town)
- Proximity to the mountains (or at least one mt - Pikes Peak)
- Not quite as hot in summers
- That much closer to Denver and/or DIA
- Lots more professional services available
- Pueblo can have a harder time attracting skilled workers, so sometimes easier to compete for work there than in Springs
- Can be friendlier to transplants since big military churn
- Perceptions of crime (though there are areas of Springs that are just as bad as the rougher parts of Pueblo)

And some reasons I hear for the inverse, living in Pueblo and working in Springs: 
 
- Much cheaper housing/lots and somewhat cheaper cost of living (gas a bit more expensive though)
- Much less traffic
- Warmer winter weather
- Less formal, very laid back, slower pace of life
- Outdoor stuff and other things less crowded
- Community is somewhat less transient since no huge military component
- Has 'big small town' feel even though city of 110k 
- Lake Pueblo and the Arkansas River
- Easier to get involved in the community in Pueblo
- Bigger job market in Springs, more specializations, and usually pays higher for equivalent industries
- 'Hidden gem' - the crime statistics and lack of huge tourist draws like Springs' Olympic stuff, Pikes Peak, USAFA, Garden of Gods, etc make it so fewer come to Pueblo casually

Ultimately the commute is about 45 mins in normal weather and traffic from city center to city center. Less if you lived in Fountain and worked on the Northside of Pueblo (like 25-30 mins, depending). Fountain may make your commute south easier and be more affordable than living in Springs proper, but it is a suburban development and not a fun, city-kind of place. I think Pueblo has all of the things you mentioned at a cost of living that lets you get out and enjoy them, but Springs will have more of all of that since it is just a bigger town and situated a bit closer to the mountains. It comes at the cost of a commute and the added housing costs to live there. For my money, living close to downtown Pueblo (like bike/walk distance to most stuff), even though it's a much more modest town, is more fun than trying to live close to downtown Springs, or in a suburb where you have to drive to get to the offerings of the city.",t2_13iicm,HazyRay,0,1641244991.0,0,t1_hr4iibg,hr4iibg,False,Zamicol,t3_obws4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/pueblo/comments/obws4j/moving_to_pueblojobs_thread/,Moving to Pueblo/Jobs Thread,/r/pueblo/comments/obws4j/moving_to_pueblojobs_thread/hr4iibg/,3,r/pueblo,0,3

"1) Climate - weather is damn near perfect. Very little moisture. Blue skies nearly every day. Definitely a reprieve from foggy soggy Milwaukee.  
2) Cost of living - one of the least expensive places to live in Colorado. Gas is more expensive here.  
3) Proximity to a major city - 2 hours from Denver and DIA  
4) Small town but not TOO small - there's a decent selection of grocery stores, a Target, a Walmart, hardware stores, etc. All the conveniences. I miss international grocery stores and Indian food (although there is an Indian restaurant)

So we're enjoying the ""small town living"" of our youth but we're also world savvy so the high crime statistics weren't a deterrent. We've found the people to be pleasant for the most part.

"Here’s a post from my dad that explains everything in much more detail

Hello my name is Carl Falk I am reaching out  trying to get our sons story out so that we can find a law firm that would be willing to help us out. I’ll try to be as short as possible but it’s very hard with the situation￼.

I’m a Marine Corps Iraqi war veteran.

While deployed wife and mother of my kids developed a meth addiction.

I divorced her became a single dad of three kids.

We were fine kids were active in sports and rodeo, church and school but then a Greeley judge ordered me to re-introduce them to their mother.

She soon relapsed after being reunited and ended up dragging two of my kids into that lifestyle with her.

My son ended up catching some juvenile charges and spent the rest of his youth from age 13 all the way till 19 in the juvenile system 

Quickly fell back into the drug lifestyle while on parole. His parole officer would not do anything about it because of Covid this lasted for about a year before he was arrested as an adult

And that is where the story gets really chaotic as he tried to get help. I would much rather tell all this in person but it boils down to him trying to get help from hospitals from police officers from behavioral health centers and all of those places turning him away because of Covid.

I convinced him one night to call the police for help I told him to go into a gas station and call from inside so that he would not pick up any traffic charges because I knew that he was most likely under the influence of drugs and he was driving his truck. He did what I told him to. He went into a 7-Eleven in Loveland and called the police for help. They end up arresting him taking him to the Loveland Jail. At the Jail he has an anxiety attack and they call for paramedics who inject him with something to help him calm down they then take him to McKee Medical Center in Loveland where he is released and allowed to go back to his vehicle because the Loveland police department did not impound it even though they charged him with a DUI. That’s where I start to have a problem with this whole story. He gets in an accident within a few hours and ends up being arrested again For a second DUI charge within eight hours of each other. He’s taken to the Larimer county Jail and  booked there. While being booked they do a body scan and something that the officer did Made chase very paranoid and he wanted to see what they were seeing on the scan An officer pulled a Taser on Chase And Chase defended himself grabbing the Taser and taking it to the floor. That caused him to pick up a felony disarming a police officer charge. He would then spend the next six months in almost complete solitary at the Larimer county jail before having a suicide attempt and me demanding that he be moved to the state hospital. He was moved within two days of my request to his public defender.

At the state hospital he seem to make a complete 100% turnaround was doing very well was happy to be out of the Jail was making progress was understanding what was happening the main purpose of him being there was for competency restoration but they were aware of his suicide attempt at the Jail.  He was there for about a month and everything was going well he just moved up to a more privileged pod and was excited to be receiving personal clothes that I had purchased for him as that was one of the perks of the new pod. 

Then one day out of the blue  I get a phone call from the state hospital that my son attempted suicide.  They said that he had hung himself with his bed sheets and that another patient found him. They said that they performed CPR for over 17 minutes before they were able to get a pulse back, but he hadn’t regained consciousness. 

He spent about a week in the ICU at Parkview medical center in Pueblo. When I got there the doctor did not have very high hopes for Chase. He told me that they were going to try a process where they basically freeze the body they drop the temperature down very low and then they keep it there for 24 hours and then warm them back up to kind of do a reset on the brain. He pretty much gave me three options but I could tell that he wasn’t very optimistic about a good outcome. well lots of prayers for Chase went up from all my friends and family and when it was time to wake him up he woke up with no memory of anything that had happened and a loss of his short term memory.  They were going to transfer him back to the state hospital and I had already met with state hospital officials and they told me that there was going to be an outside investigation and that they would let me know what they found out because it did not make any sense to me that Chase would do this. So I told them that I was not comfortable with him going back there until I found out what the report from the investigation revealed, so he was transferred to Denver Health where he remained for a few more months until all of his charges were dismissed by the courts and he was released .  

Where I am needing help is that Chase is going to need long-term medical assistance for the rest of his life due to all this we are just trying to get his medical records and a copy of the investigation report from the Colorado mental health hospital.  They gave me medical proxy over Chase While he was at parkview and we have done power of attorney‘s guardianship papers everything that we can think of and they still refuse to give us anything. We had a law firm looking into this and the law firm receive threats of losing their license if they continue to pursue it.  I’ve only been able to get one reporter to help me out her name is Debbie Kelly she works for the gazette newspaper in Colorado Springs she has ran about four articles now that have included Chases story. We did send the hospital and intent to sue letter as our timeframe for that will be up at the end of this month. 

If you think you could help in anyway running our story we would greatly appreciate it and there’s so much more to fill in crazy stuff he was shot with pepper balls while laying in his rack at the jail.  He complained of many abusive situations there but I didn’t believe him until I saw the bruises on his arm from the pepper balls at that point I knew he wasn’t lying to me being a marine I knew how hard it would be to group 4 to 5 shots in one spot if an inmate was being combative. The grouping of bruises on his arm to me told me my son was telling me the truth that he was just laying there while they shot him.  Also with the story I am trying to reach the employee from the hospital who was fired over this incident. I know that he may be the one who didn’t perform the safety check but I also believe that he’s probably the one that did CPR for over 17 minutes to get chase back.  I have made many post on my Facebook page trying to reach anyone who could help with this if you’ve read this far thank you very much and I hope to hear from you I will attach the latest Gazette article which has me boiling because the hospital has been awarded $9.1 million over my son suicide attempt that they failed  to protect him from and we can’t even get them to cooperate with us to let us know what really happened or give us records so that we can continue to try to get my son some more help. He is currently living with my sister in Texas due to the fact that we are worried that he needs protection from the state of Colorado because of everything that is going on in this. We even have questions of whether he really did attempt suicide or if this was done to him by staff or by another inmate. If that is not the case then why not just give us the report in the records and accept their responsibility in not preventing it￼ under their care?￼￼

"When I lived in the site, our neighbors were like 50/50 on the felt need for it. Lot of misunderstanding about the potential risks of metals in the soil. 

One of them said, ""We all grew up here, nobody got cancer! I'm not gonna let them tear out my lawn for this."" His toddler grandkids played in their dirt sideyard all the time... oof. 

Also, a lot of inconsistency in communication and accessibility, and turnover at the EPA contractor. We had our lot tested, cleaned, and certified and during the time it all took, we went through 3 project managers. The contractor also lost its contract temporarily so there was a gap in time when they worked with us, where it wasn't them but it wasn't anybody else either. They also changed addresses during that time without really notifying anyone. It was actually a real hassle which required a lot of nudges and pushing from us, though ultimately it did get completed. They also took out a tree they weren't supposed to. The project was run through so many parties it was like a game of ""Who's on first?"" the whole time - EPA, Corps of Engineers, APTIM (main contractor), their testing subcontractors, machinery rental companies, City of Pueblo, Board of Waterworks and Black Hills for marking utilities, etc. 

All that to say, it hasn't necessarily been made a painless process for residents, and I understand why some would choose not to engage. However, it keeps housing values low in the area since there are very few banks/CUs which will offer a mortgage on a property without a test/cleanup, and it continues to harm residents, so I wish there was more buy-in.",t2_13iicm,HazyRay,0,1639671151.0,0,t1_hosmqym,hosmqym,True,Zamicol,t3_rhjztr,https://www.reddit.com/r/pueblo/comments/rhjztr/pueblo_mayor_urges_residents_in_superfund_site_to/,Pueblo Mayor urges residents in Superfund Site to get soil tested for levels of arsenic and lead,/r/pueblo/comments/rhjztr/pueblo_mayor_urges_residents_in_superfund_site_to/hosmqym/,2,r/pueblo,0,2

"Hey I know I'm late to the party but I figured I'd give you some input since I'm from the midwest and I've spent a lot of time in Pittsburgh over the years. I'll try to break it down for you or anyone else  interested in the area.

CLIMATE- Compared to the Midwest, Pueblo is a lot drier. This includes the humidity as well as the rainfall. We get just enough rain to not be considered a desert. One of the things I miss about Ohio was how green everything was. It's too dry for trees to grow naturally (it's really the western edge of the great plains).  It's also pretty brown for about 8 months of the year. With so much open land surrounding the city, it can get pretty windy at times; 50 mph gusts as I'm typing this. Being a (near) desert, it can get pretty hot in summer, expect a couple weeks around 100 degrees. It really doesn't bother me that much since the humidity is low. It can get cold in the winter but in general, its a lot more mild and a lot less snow than northern Colorado. We get about 300 sunny days a year so you don't have the grey winter skies that the midwest is famous for. Snow melts a lot faster because of this, which is also nice.

AMENITIES- One thing to keep in mind with Pueblo is that you don't have the amenities that a larger city like Pittsburgh has. Most of the bigger concerts and events are going to be closer to Denver, maybe in the Springs. As for shopping Pueblo, has most of the big  box stores like you would expect such as Best Buy or Home Depot. For some things, you might have to drive up to Colorado  Springs. You really don't have the trendy restaurants and stores that you would find in the Springs. (ex Trader Joes, Costco, Qdoba, In N Out). There are also some odd business's missing, like the fact that there's not a single Chase Bank in the area. As others have mentioned, there are a lot of good local restaurants and breweries. It all comes down to what you're looking for. 

ECONOMY-Probably the biggest downside with Pueblo is that it's a pretty poor city. It's been called the Detroit of Colorado and in some ways, that name is accurate. Pueblo was a steel producing town that fell on hard times as mills closed. There still is a large mill along with a few other manufacturers, but overall the economy is pretty weak. Driving through, the city, a lot of shops and neighborhoods just look rundown. I wouldn't move here without having a job lined up.  Colorado in general has a bad homeless problem but Pueblo may be even worse given it's small size. There's a pretty big drug and alcohol problem, and that's not just limited to the homeless. My girlfriend is a nurse so she sees a lot of this everyday. When she worked in Denver, the nurses wore Lululemon to work and had never had a Twinkie before. When she worked in Colorado Springs, the nurses did triathlons on the weekends. In Pueblo, the nurses mainly eat McDonalds and complain about their baby-daddies...

CRIME -When you talk to people from Denver, they make Pueblo sound like a 3rd world country. In reality, it's not that bad but there are definitely some rough areas. And that's to be expected in an economically depressed area. Statistically, its the most violent city in Colorado. I live Pueblo West which is about 20 minutes west of the city. I feel very safe here; I've left packages on my porch for days with no issue. Other people can probably recommend good neighborhoods in the city.

RECREATION- Generally speaking, there's a lot of good hiking within a 50 minute drive. Pueblo doesn't have any mountains near the city but there's a lot that you can drive to in a hour or less. Most of the ski resorts are within a 2.5 to 3 hour drive. And the Pueblo reservoir is just west of town. It's one of the largest lakes in Colorado and it has plenty of walking/biking trails as well as fishing and camping.
So overall if it were me, I would pick Pittsburgh over Pueblo. Pueblo is getting a lot better, but it still has a ways to go. However if you have a good job offer or you want to be reasonably close to the mountains without paying exorbitant prices, Pueblo might be a good choice. Either way, I recommend you spending some time here to really get feel for the place.",t2_cthtt,1875coalminer,0,1639190541.0,0,t1_ho2l97w,ho2l97w,False,Zamicol,t3_obws4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/pueblo/comments/obws4j/moving_to_pueblojobs_thread/,Moving to Pueblo/Jobs Thread,/r/pueblo/comments/obws4j/moving_to_pueblojobs_thread/ho2l97w/,3,r/pueblo,0,3
