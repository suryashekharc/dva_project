"Newcomers don't necessarily 'drive up housing' - people coming in from Cali aren't buying 'hard scrabble' housing stock, (unless they're smart and saving their payouts for other things like travel). People coming here and building new houses are hiring all sorts of local workers, giving them good jobs. They're going to the local doctors and dentists and buying local a lot of the time. Their tax dollars are going to support the local and state government. The trouble with keeping out the newcomers is, you stay stuck in your 1950s frame of mind, too. The computer you're typing on wasn't invented in some town that idolizes football and the BuyBull... that 'liberalism' you're so afraid of is where the future is coming from. The problem I see here TN is people who are afraid of change, which is inevitable. Embrace it or fight it, it's coming either way.

CityData has a subset for each state, and then by cities/towns and you can read the postings (everything with a grain of salt, there's malcontents everywhere as well as the opposite cheerleader types) and ask pertinent questions for your particular lifestyle. Don't be afraid to connect with realtors in the areas you're interested in - they can help in lots of ways with both info as well as new listings just hitting the market, and other stuff. A good realtor can save you thousands of dollars on properties you'd never otherwise hear about.  Edited to add - I'm on the Cumberland Plateau and definitely recommend being at altitude (2000 feet elevation here) if you're going to move anywhere in the south.

"It seems like you and I have a fundamental disagreement on the function of taxation in society. I believe taxation is one half of an exchange, I which I receive access to services made for the good of all, such as the road network, state parks, and many others. While I am greatly annoyed how a large part of our budget is spent on things I don't agree with, my disappointment comes from what is being done in my name, and not  that I was taxed to begin with. 

I don't believe that the so called ""original state"" is viable, and unsure whether something like that could even have existed in human society.

Let me reiterate that I don't want a check from Gates, Buffet, or any of them. I want them to be subject to the same set of rules as I am, so that they (and anyone else) can benefit from the society that we live in.

I also believe that, in the majority of cases, those with more than about $500MM used highly unethical (but not illegal) practices to obtain or maintain that wealth, and many of those practices should (IMO) become illegal, or become publically despised to a degree where they are avoided for that reason alone.

If a founder's stake in a private company is less than 2% of their assets, they've got bigger problems. The entire point of making it that small (and avoidable by deductions) is that it is not going to force anyone but the most illiquid people to sell anything. This assumes that the company actually has positive value.

If it's an incorporation, then partial sales of nonvoting shares are an option, or voting shares that are too small to win anything.

However, using holdings of a founded company as the sole source of retirement income is not considered good investment practice.",t2_d6464,KJ4IPS,0,1648934496.0,0,t1_i35iaxf,i35iaxf,False,BuroDude,t3_tsxxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/,Report: Tennessee has second-lowest overall tax burden,/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/i35iaxf/,1,r/Tennessee,0,1

"that's the backdrop under which the amendment was drafted.

> Anti-Federalists argued that the proposed Constitution would take from the states their principal means of defense against federal usurpation....

> Implicit in the debate between Federalists and Anti-Federalists were two shared assumptions. First, that the proposed new Constitution gave the federal government almost total legal authority over the army and militia. Second, that the federal government should not have any authority at all to disarm the citizenry. They disagreed only about whether an armed populace could adequately deter federal oppression.

> The Second Amendment conceded nothing to the Anti-Federalists’ desire to sharply curtail the military power of the federal government, which would have required substantial changes in the original Constitution. Yet the Amendment was easily accepted because of widespread agreement that the federal government should not have the power to infringe the right of the people to keep and bear arms, any more than it should have the power to abridge the freedom of speech or prohibit the free exercise of religion.

> Much has changed since 1791. **The traditional militia fell into desuetude, and state-based militia organizations were eventually incorporated into the federal military structure.** The nation’s military establishment has become enormously more powerful than eighteenth century armies. We still hear political rhetoric about federal tyranny, but most Americans do not fear the nation’s armed forces and virtually no one thinks that an armed populace could defeat those forces in battle.

i realize Heller and McDonald have changed and twisted interpretations through the years, but the point I'm making is that out-of-context blurbs like ""shall not be infringed"" are useless. 

> Heller tentatively suggested a list of “presumptively lawful” regulations, including bans on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, bans on carrying firearms in “sensitive places” such as schools and government buildings, laws restricting the commercial sale of arms, bans on the concealed carry of firearms, and bans on weapons “not typically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes.”

"There are multiple pieces:

First, if he is avoiding taxes, the loopholes used to avoid those need to be closed, and that tax collected with the standard penalty interest.

Second, currently the tax code heavily favors passive income (such as capital gains and dividends) much more than it favors earned income. The tax code (imo) should be adjusted such that passive income is taxed at least as much as earned income.

Third, the tax brackets currently don't have any response to extreme amounts of income, adding more and higher tax brackets allows and more equitable distribution of our tax burden. This would only affect people who are in those brackets, if you don't make enough to enter the bracket, you are unaffected.

Fourth, currently unrealized gains can be used as collateral without declaring a value or taxing them, and because a loan is actually a net zero transaction, it itself is not taxed. This is a really effective loophole if you have a huge portfolio, and some type of realization or tax in lieu would be appropriate.

Finally, the subject of an asset tax is somewhat decisive, however, because our income tax can be so easily gamed, It is likely to be appropriate at high levels of wealth, requiring 1-2% from entities above the 90% mark. Because market performance is generally greater than inflation by more than that amount, these entities can continue to grow their wealth, abet at an induced rate. It's very important that these values are tracked off of indices, to allow them to dynamically adapt to a changing economy.

Note that deductions are still likely to apply, so if you make it a point to spend enough of your assets and income on tax deductible charities, your AGI is likely to be low enough to keep you out of higher brackets or the requirement for an asset tax.",t2_d6464,KJ4IPS,0,1648908174.0,0,t1_i33xh9f,i33xh9f,False,BuroDude,t3_tsxxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/,Report: Tennessee has second-lowest overall tax burden,/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/i33xh9f/,1,r/Tennessee,0,1

"I am not sure what you mean by force. If we allowed people to pay only the tax they choose, our entire nation would collapse. The “pay what you want” system doesn’t work as a system of government anywhere in the modern world. 

You don’t get to choose everything in life. If you want to live under the umbrella of protection the United States provides, you have to hold it once in a while. 

And we “force” people to do things all the time. Yes, if you’re a business, you are “forced” to serve customers of all races, even if you’re a racist. You may not drink alcohol and drive on public roads, and if you insist, you will be stopped by force. 

The idea that no one should ever be compelled to do anything and can love however they want is ludicrous. You started your reply by attempting to call me an “intellectual type”, but then proceed to offer no real ideas other than to say everything else is a bad idea. You seem like one of these “sovereign citizen” types. That’s fine, but it’s a delusion. Those ideals haven’t been successfully implemented anywhere on earth. There is no model for it anywhere.

"While he may be well spoken and clear with his messaging the delivery method is a part of it.  This isnt written it is spoken and shown via video.  

When working on an influence operation you need to consider your target audience.  You must take into account their frame of mind and cultural norms.  You need to have a series of influencing methods that reinforce each other over a period of time.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_operations_(United_States)#Process


>In order to create a successful PSYOP the following must be established:

>1. clearly define the mission so that it aligns with national objectives
2. need a PSYOP estimate of the situation
3. prepare the plan
4. media selection
5. product development
6. pretesting - determines the probable impact of the PSYOP on the target audience
7. production and dissemination of PSYOP material
8. implementation
9. posttesting - evaluates audience responses
10. feedback

>Before these steps can occur, intelligence analysts must profile potential targets in order to determine which ones it would be most beneficial to target. In order to figure this out, analysts must determine the vulnerabilities of these groups and what they would be susceptible to. The analysts also determine the attitudes of the targets toward the current situation, their complaints, ethnic origin, frustrations, languages, problems, tensions, attitudes, motivations, and perceptions, and so on. Once the appropriate target(s) have been determined, the PSYOP can be created.

>Psychological operations should be planned carefully, in that even a tactical message, with modern news media, can spread worldwide and be treated as the policy of the United States. The U.S. Army is responsible for military psychological warfare doctrine.[7] See the World War I section for an example of how a tactical leaflet, not properly coordinated, can cause national-level harm.


>Psychological operations, at any level, must be consistent with the policies of higher levels of command
The message to be delivered can be adapted to tactical situations, but promises made must be consistent with national policy.

What I'm saying in this conversation (not our other one), is that most republicans don't think one race is superior or inferior to another and race doesn't drive their policy making.

"Sure, but even charging $45 is too much for something that costs like $3 to produce. Even if it were $10-20 it would be too much in my opinion because it’s a medicine that many people require in order to live, but at least that price is more justifiable between production, shipping, etc than charging well over 10x what it costs to produce.

From the article you linked, ""Still, having insurance doesn't mean insulin is affordable. Insured patients will often pay a copay or a percentage, rather than the list price, for their insulin. Redmond says that cost could range from $30 to $50.

In cases of high-deductible health plans, patients have to pay the list price for their insulin until their deductible is met. This could mean thousands of dollars out of pocket. “Many patients just have a problem paying that much,” says Redmond.""

"This issue is a lot more complicated than Reddit is capable of discussing.  The very first step to understanding the issue would be to recognize that the insulin cost problem has been greatly exaggerated.  You'll see posts about $1000 insulin on Reddit frequently, but they don't tell you that there are lots of different kinds of insulin.  Generic, old technology insulin is still cheap everywhere.  Newer technologies, inhalers, etc, that stuff is expensive because it's new.

EDIT: Also, Wal-Mart has $25 insulin vials.  Just FYI in case anyone actually needs insulin, but they won't see this post.

&#x200B;

""most patients need about two vials of insulin per month or one to two packs of insulin pens. Each pen pack is equivalent to about one and a half vials. As of March 2022, the price for a vial of insulin ranges from $50 to over $1,000, and a pack of pens ranges from $45 to over $600.""

So, at the low end, insulin costs $45 to $100 a month, with no insurance.

Korea — $10.30

Some of the poorer countries will have high costs as well, but once again. It is because they don't have regulations or health related social safety nets in place for their population.

"It doesn't matter if *only* 90% of the white republican population is racist. The republican party's sole purpose is to push policies explicitly meant to hurt black people more than white people. Therefore, if you vote republican, you are supporting racism.

I've asked plenty of republicans and almost all of them fully agree and understand that it's about keeping people deemed undeserving of it (who are more often poor and black) from having access to healthcare, and that's all it's about. It's quite generous of you to say that republicans are too stupid to understand the effects of the policies they support

You also seriously misunderstand what empathy is. Empathy is wishing for everyone in your country to have access to free or near free healthcare like the rest of the developed world.

"There are different types of insulin. Different types have different price points.

It sort of like amphetamines. There, you've got instant release salts that are cheap and generic, name brand extended release versions of the instant stuff, and products that interact with your body to make the drug (e.g., vyvanse). The instant release salts are < $40, but vyvanse is between $200 and $400. They do the same thing, but vyvanse is smoother, longer lasting, and builds a tolerance more slowly than the instant stuff.

"It will vary. A tax has a different effect based on the marginal effect of the $ it takes.

The following are the definitions I tend to use:

Poor is when you are just scraping by, perturbation here can have lasting impacts.

Normal is just that. You are pretty confident in meeting basic needs (Maslow: Phys and Safety). You can absorb small surprises, and afford some limited luxuries. You might have access to instruments to help absorb larger issues.

Wealthy is that you now have enough income that simply keeping it in savings/money market is no longer a wise choice. Higher risk/reward options like the stock market are no practical. You still rely on outside income, but managing your wealth is now part of your normal activities. Surprises here mostly only affect future wealth growth.

Very Wealthy means that your passive incomes now dwarf any normal job. You only work for others if you desire to. You may be an accredited investor. You have enough liquid or liquidatable assets to cover pretty much any surprise.

Ultra Wealthy individuals have such a high level of passive income, that no feasible lifestyle could ever overcome that income, the mechanics of moving money around, and choosing what to do with it become the bottleneck. At this point, even talking about amounts less than $100k seems silly.

Destitute is when you don't have enough to participate in society, and cannot meet basic needs now, or will not be able to in the near future. Surprises here have limited impact, because your fate is already determined, and another loss doesn't change the picture that much

Destitute - Probably doesn't even make the standard deductible. AGI of 0 means no income tax  
Poor - Taxing this group affects their ability to meet needs  
Wealty/VW - Taxing this group may reduce their maximum possible lifestyle, or future gains potential  
Ultra Wealthy - This groups income is so high, that even a % based tax is unlikely to affect lifestyle, but may affect future gains.",t2_d6464,KJ4IPS,0,1648831937.0,0,t1_i305dfl,i305dfl,False,BuroDude,t3_tsxxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/,Report: Tennessee has second-lowest overall tax burden,/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/i305dfl/,1,r/Tennessee,0,1

"Chattanooga IS awesome but I have to add that to get into any half decent school in Hamilton county you have to go through a lottery system and it is terrible. There are more kids on the waiting list than actually getting in and the public schools have a lower rating unless you're in a wealthy area.  A lot of people end up either homeschooling or going the private school route bc of this. I have a rising kindergartner and am beyond disappointed. I'm actually considering moving across the line and into GA just bc of the fact they have a much better school system.
Also, the current governor doesn't really seem to want to invest in fixing the public schools we already have. He's a believer in the voucher program and wants to partner with a Christian group to supply the state with more charter schools with an underlying of religion thrown in there.

"Where are the 10% lording over the 90%?  How about the Senate?  The fact that we give the same political power to a Senator from Wyoming as we do to a Senator from Texas allows the very few to wield enormous power over the many. The filibuster makes that legislative power almost absolute. Take 40 senators from the smallest 20 states - you’ve got the 10% ruling the 90%. The bottom 20 states have 33 million people in them combined (10% of total US population) and 40 total Senators which is enough for a filibuster. That 10% has the power to stop any legislation or any Supreme Court nomination. 

The more than four million people in Washington DC and Puerto Rico have no representation in the Senate at all. And yes, Puerto Ricans pay US federal taxes (Social Security tax, Medicare tax, etc). That’s taxation without representation and we fought a war over that about 250 years ago. 

And don’t forget that 5 times in history, the Presidential candidate with the most votes didn’t win the election. In all five cases, this benefitted the Republican Party. How is that fair?  

I agree that taxes are far too high for what we get. We pay too much for social security, but we don’t get the same benefit from it because health care corporations bleed that money away from people.

And speaking of social security, the Average American has spent every dime they’ve put into social security within four years. But the poorest Americans never even see a dime of that money because they die far sooner than the rich - as much as 14% sooner (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4866586/). 

If your premise is that the government takes too much money and spends it on the wrong things, then you and I are in total agreement. The overall tax burden could be lowered and we could actually increase services to people with less money. Perhaps we could survive by eliminating personal income taxes altogether, and instead taxing corporate profits. 

Since Reagan, taxes for the poor and middle class have increased. Taxes for the wealthy have gone down dramatically. And the only ones better off between then and now are the wealthy. They are richer and the poor are poorer. So let’s go back to how taxes were when Reagan was President. 

What we are currently doing isn’t working for most Americans, and certainly not for most Tennesseans. I am all for cutting taxes, but cut the taxes that affect the poor first. There is no reason to have Tennessee’s tax on unleaded gas be .27 cents a gallon, while the tax on jet fuel is only .014 cents per gallon. Yes, that’s right. Jet fuel taxes are under two cents a gallon so that the rich get taxed 95% less for a gallon of fuel to fly their Gulfstream 6 aircraft flying to the Bahamas than the poor have to pay for a gallon of unleaded to put in their 12 year old Chevy Aveo to drive to work at the Weigel’s. What’s the reasoning behind taxing jet fuel at a 95% lower rate than car fuel?

The 30% you pay is high. When my own tax returns were well over $200k a year, we paid about 22%. Warren Buffet paid only 14%. Trump paid nothing. Neither did Amazon. That doesn’t make sense, does it?

I guess I would ask you, in your opinion, what should we do (if anything) about the poor in this country?  Do they deserve better?  Should the just fend for themselves?  Do we have any moral obligation as citizens to help our poorest and most vulnerable?",t2_rii6qo3,CO_74,0,1648807120.0,0,t1_i2yqbit,i2yqbit,False,BuroDude,t3_tsxxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/,Report: Tennessee has second-lowest overall tax burden,/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/i2yqbit/,2,r/Tennessee,0,2

"You are right about a lot of that. 51% shouldn’t rule all the time, that’s tyranny of the majority. That’s why we needed the Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court to integrate schools - the majority simply was never going to protect the minority. Individual rights is what differentiates our democracy from others. That’s not a bad thing. But allowing the 10% to lord over the 90% isn’t good either. That’s oligarchy. In my own opinion, that’s what I think we are slipping towards. We are rapidly losing our middle class. That’s a bad thing. 

I completely agree with you that public education is eroding. One of the reasons is increasing class size and smaller budgets. I used to think one of the reasons it was eroding was crappy teachers, which is why I decided to become one. Then I got to see the teachers and live in their shoes. There are crappy teachers, but not NEARLY how many I thought. What I found was absolute shoestring budgets and classrooms with 35+ kids in them. Teachers in my district are split about 50/50 conservative/liberal, but none of us disagree on the basics of education. 

Spending in education hasn’t kept up with incomes or spending in other areas. Tennessee is one of the worst, spending only a little over $9,000 per pupil. 

But we don’t necessarily have to look to democrats for answers. Perhaps look to Wyoming, one fo the most staunchly conservative/Republican states in the union.  They have no state income tax, only a 4% sales tax (with up to 2% local sales tax added regionally), and yet still spends $16,500 per student on education. They also have one of the least expensive public universities (U of Wyoming), while ranking 21st nationally in education and 4th nationally in higher education. It CAN be done without charging everyone an arm and a leg, but some have to pay their fair share. In Wyoming, they decided to tax corporations. Maybe that would work in Tennessee. 

Also, if you are wealthy enough to be able to dedicate a few years to teaching, I would highly recommend doing so!  It’s a great way to serve your community and puts you in touch with all kinds of different groups. If you’re open to changing your mind, teaching will do that for you in ways you might not imagine.

"In fairness, there are plenty of intellectuals who believe exactly as you do. Some of the smartest people in the world are conservatives. And some of the dumbest are liberals. And vice versa. 

I believe we should all vote, and you should do what you believe is best for you and your family. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. People who vote do so because they think they are doing the right thing. That’s honorable, regardless of who you vote for. 

I believe we are in a democracy and we should let the people decide. Sometimes the people want democratic ideas. Sometimes Republican ideas. That’s ok. No one political party should rule forever - that’s communism. If we get rid of all the democrats or all the republicans, we become China or Russia. We switch up whose in power to keep the politicians on their toes and make sure they are doing what’s in the best interest of the people. 

Just because we disagree politically doesn’t mean we can’t still get along politically. I think we agree on lots of things. There are too many poor people in Tennessee, and most of them work extremely hard. If you work 40-60 hours a week as hard as you can, you should be able to have a place to live, food to eat, and access to a doctor and decent healthcare without having to go bankrupt. I think most people agree with that sentiment. We just disagree with how we go about accomplishing that. So we try something out. If it doesn’t work, what we should do is admit it, then try something else out - even if the other party suggests it!

Case in point (and to agree with you a bit) Sales tax CAN work - that’s how they do it in the United Kingdom. They call it a VAT, or value added tax. And they use that money to pay for things like childcare and health care, which benefit everyone equally. Getting cancer sucks equally for the rich and the poor. Getting free child care is a wonderful benefit to provide both wealthy and poor people equally because it has equal monetary value, but can really help poor people even more by giving them the ability to get out of the house and find a job!  

We can (and should) continue disagreeing with one another; that’s how a good and functional two party system works. But we should stop hating the people we disagree with. I 100% think we both want what’s best for our families and our countries, we just have different ways of trying to accomplish it. 

I see all these poor families in East Tennessee in my school district. They work so hard and struggle so much. I just think we can do better for them. Whatever we’re doing for them right now isn’t working, and however you slice it, Republicans have been in charge of the state for so long. They’ve held every local elected office in my conservative county for 30+ years. It’s getting worse, not better. And every day the headline is about some social issue that doesn’t help the poor people in my school district one bit. I just want politicians to help these people. That’s what I am here trying to do.",t2_rii6qo3,CO_74,0,1648770597.0,0,t1_i2x186s,i2x186s,False,BuroDude,t3_tsxxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/,Report: Tennessee has second-lowest overall tax burden,/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/i2x186s/,2,r/Tennessee,0,2

"""Plans are nothing; planning is everything."" ~Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Any plan should plan for wind, sure.  Things don't always go to plan.  You may think you have it somewhat contained but hot Ash ignites bush on the other side and now the fire has jumped the road.  It's also not like the normal winds we get.  It was averaging 20mph faster wind speeds than normal, excluding gusts.

Wind does two things:
1. It provides oxygen to feed the fire.  Hence why there are bellows for stoves and the phrase ""fan the flames"" exists.
2.  It pushes the flames to travel.  It can pick up hot or even burning objects and carry them, causing other spots to catch on fire.
Hot fires are dangerous due to the damage they can cause, but wind exacerbates the danger of spreading said fire.",t2_owevz6t,CheeseBurger_Jesus,0,1648767185.0,0,t1_i2wtgai,i2wtgai,False,BuroDude,t3_tsxxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/,Report: Tennessee has second-lowest overall tax burden,/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/i2wtgai/,1,r/Tennessee,0,1

"You’d be wrong. I have been wealthy, and made so much money that I was able to leave IT and become a teacher. I could afford to lose 75% of my income because I wanted to serve my community, not just with my taxes, but with my experience, insight, and labor as well. Right when the pandemic hit and people started fleeing education, that’s when I decided to get into it. My wife was a successful real estate agent and also left that to become a teacher. We intentionally chose one of the poorest rural districts in East Tennessee.  We work in rural Title 1 schools. 

About more taxes for the wealthy, well, that’s exactly what I am saying. The rich should pay a larger percentage than the poor. That’s a progressive tax system, and it’s the way it has been since the first taxation in this country. 

Why should the rich pay more?  Because they have more to lose. If our society collapses, if we are invaded, or if a pandemic sweeps through and kills 3/4 of us, life for the poor who survive doesn’t really change that much - they still eke out a living day to day. But life for the wealthy changes dramatically. They lose their BMWs and vacation time.  They lose their retirement and savings. The wealthy have a LOT to lose - therefore, they should pay the most to protect that lifestyle. 

But that’s not what wealthy conservatives want. What they really want is to pay 0 while claiming to pay more than anyone. 

It’s the reason conservative politicians no longer release their tax returns.  They have finally accomplished the goal. They are now the freeloaders, while the poor have their income taxes for FICA, social security, sales tax, and gasoline tax.  The best hoodwink they pulled is convincing a great number of the poor that this is a good deal for them and to “just trust me on my tax returns”. 

I propose we go back to the Ronald Reagan way of doing things. Trust, but verify. All elected officials release full federal tax returns. We also revert taxes to exactly what they were when Reagan was President, which would mean lower taxes for the poor and middle class, and a fair tax on the wealthy. If it was good enough for Ronald Reagan, it ought to be good enough for modern conservatives.",t2_rii6qo3,CO_74,1,1648766500.0,0,t1_i2wrv73,i2wrv73,False,BuroDude,t3_tsxxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/,Report: Tennessee has second-lowest overall tax burden,/r/Tennessee/comments/tsxxwh/report_tennessee_has_secondlowest_overall_tax/i2wrv73/,0,r/Tennessee,0,0

"I remember a massive fire near our house when I was in elementary school. We lived just below the tunnel on Huskey's Grove. I watched the ridge behind our house burn and was scared to death. We were evacuated that time and at least two other times when they thought a forest fire might spread. 

We always had fires in the mountains when I was growing up, just never as bad as these recent ones. 

I don't know that we can blame two large fires in 6 years on climate change. Especially when we know for a fact that the first fire was started on purpose. Yes, we had the bad luck to have strong winds both times, but we've had winds just as strong before. I remember having no power for a week due to a wind storm when I was in high school.

"Talking about the “overall” tax burden is a way to conceal tax breaks for the wealthy. In Tennessee, wealthy people pay far less than they would in other states because a lot of the tax burden is shifted to the poor. 

Tennessee has the highest sales taxes in the nation. Since poor people spend 100% of their money every month, they get taxed at a higher rate in Tennessee than they would ANYWHERE in the nation. They wouldn’t be paying much (if any) income tax anyway, so having a 0% personal income tax doesn’t help the poor at all. 

For example, if you had the choice between paying a 1% annual income tax on your income or an extra 3% sales tax…. What would be better?  Well, if you spend 100% of your income or have a modest savings, it would be the income tax. 

Tennessee’s tax rates for the rich are superb for them. The tax for the middle class is about the same as any other state. But the tax on the poor is enormous.

"Fuck me if they were only this thorough in anything actually productive. That third link is the most important part, someone has obviously been working on this since 2015 with the thorough nature of those findings.

This is why Obergefell needed to be a stepping stone and not an end all to the conversation. Getting rid of marriage as a state concept like they’re doing uproots the judicial interpretation. They’re effectively making the state the -recorder- of the marital contract and not the officiating body. The state will recognize the common law interpretation, so it’s not -technically- violating any rights. You can go ahead and say that you’re married, just like anyone else. The state just won’t record it for records sake. 

This bill is legitimately the reason why the fight should have been to have the federal government recognize marriage as a right between two consenting adults to avoid this issue.

I haven’t finished reading so I have no idea how this will impact issues that revolve around medical care, taxes, loan applications, etc. but my gut tells me that it won’t be for the better.

Edit, re downvotes: c’mon people. Don’t shoot the messenger. If you want to defeat your opponent you have to understand how they think.

They *think* they are really doing the best thing- just like they think taking horse dewormer will save them from covid.

Really, they are terrified that their children won’t grow up to have the same values as them, and they are perfectly happy to lie, cheat, steal, and kill to make sure their kids don’t have the opportunity to think for themselves and consider a multitude of viewpoints, because they know that their own cannot stand up to reason because they are literally founded upon claims of miracles.

"License plate readers are having real problems with seeing the new tags at night, and apparently the state has said it's not their problem. 

I don't care one way or the other about the new design, though it is rather basic. And the tags do seem less robust than they should. It was clearly the cheapest option available, and lowest possible budget item they could manage. That's right in line with my expectations of the state -- and they didn't disappoint. 

The inability of the LPR machines to see these tags is going to present constant problems, and have a negative impact on police budgets statewide. That will eventually make enough impact that something has to be done, and ultimately, the costs of that blunder will cost the taxpayers triple the savings.

"From the article:

“Mauricio Luna never had a chance.

Three Knoxville police officers were blazing down Kingston Pike after 3 a.m. last August on their way to a burglary call at speeds reaching 90 mph. None of them had their emergency lights and sirens on, which is against the law and against department policy.

Luna wouldn't have known what was approaching until it was too late. He was turning left across Kingston Pike as officer Cody Klingmann bore down on him in the darkness.”

“Even though Klingmann braked at the last instant, he slammed into Luna’s driver-side door traveling 81 mph, according to a report from the Knox County District Attorney’s office.

Luna likely died instantly, pronounced dead at the scene.”

And then this “the DA’s office declined to charge the officer who was breaking state law, saying instead Luna was partly to blame for his own death.”",t2_5qcoxim3,PluPerfectPlus,0,1648592279.0,0,t1_i2mj1cz,i2mj1cz,False,PluPerfectPlus,t3_trot4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tennessee/comments/trot4r/da_blames_driver_for_failure_to_yield_when_he_was/,DA blames driver for 'failure to yield' when he was killed by cop speeding without lights,/r/Tennessee/comments/trot4r/da_blames_driver_for_failure_to_yield_when_he_was/i2mj1cz/,19,r/Tennessee,0,19

"> Prices have shot up and native Tenneseans cannot afford to live in their state anymore.

Wages are always the last thing to shift. Tennessee household incomes will eventually move upwards, but we're still 3-5 years away, at a minimum. 

A huge part of the problem that few people want to acknowledge is that Tennessee real estate was *severely* undervalued compared to much of the country even until just a few years ago. I bought a 3 bed/2 bath on 0.5 acre in a quiet subdivision 7 years ago for $119k.

"Same story in Texas. I hear stories from friends and family in Nashville and Chattanooga, and it's the same around the major TX cities and burbs.

"My dad bought his house for 170k in like 2014. Now it's worth 300k on todays market. Theres two houses in his cul de sac that have LESS square footage, and they are being *rented* for 2k a month.

The few houses that do go to market these days are immediately scooped up by investors and turned into yet another overpriced rental, so even if you have a house and want to sell, theres really nowhere else for you to go.

I can tell you what I have done which is working for me.  I sold my house in Farragut outside Knoxville for twice what I paid for it.   I was able to use that significant profit to purchase a 9 acre horse farm and am building on it.
