"i work in the MEP industry and have worked on several rec centres. Per csa b52, the refrigerant code, there’s continuous exhaust that occurs so long as the plant is running within the refrigerant plant room. There’s also an entire leak detection system tied to a separate emergency exhaust fan. If there’s an ammonia concentration within the room that reaches a count higher than the ppm limit the fan turns on for a period of time and alerts the building owner. If the count doesn’t reach an acceptable level within a certain time period the whole plant is shut down and owner alerted again.

1. stop feeling like you're entitled to everything. no one cares if you have to eat breakfast or not, that's not the employer's fault that you had to eat and was late for your shift.

"My family recently discovered Uncle Joe's on main street Markham. It's not fancy dining and if you want casual, it's casual at its core but we have gone back multiple times since before Christmas and have found it quite enjoyable and still intend to go back. 

Imagine a 80s/90s decor restaurant/diner. Menu selection is basic but has things like burgers, hot sandwiches, pasta, soups and salads, steaks, leg of lamb, rack of lamb, fish and chips, grilled seafood. Their seafood chowder is quite good. Kids enjoyed the pasta and the burgers and fried etc. 

Their Leg of Lamb requires a 1 day-1/2 day notice and serves up to 5 people and corns with soup and garlic bread. We enjoyed that a lot. Added 4 other entrees and soup and the bill was still like $225 for 7 people. I have a family member that's quite peculiar and picky when it comes to dining and they even enjoyed it. So can't be bad I guess. Don't the the decor and atmosphere fool you. It's a decent place.

"The Symposium on Kennedy and Major Mackenzie has always been my go-to for family events. They've been accommodating with wheelchairs and strollers before.

"What do you expect? Many of our politicians are criminals themselves. Rob Ford drove drunk multiple times, not to mention the whole crack thing. Doug Ford and his brother Randy used to be drug dealers. Randy Ford was once charged with drug-related kidnapping. Doug's sister Kathy and her boyfriend were involved in multiple gun-related and violent offences including threatening to murder Rob Ford. There's more too, it's a really long article:

https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/globe-investigation-the-ford-familys-history-with-drug-dealing/article12153014/

It's always ironic to hear Ford talk about how he's 'tough on crime' given his history. Guess rich people can be criminals too. It's also ironic that he talks about improving education when he barely finished high school and dropped out of Humber College after two months.

Although to be clear, drivers are very rarely charged with criminal offences. Careless driving, careless driving causing death, stunt driving, running red lights or stop signs, etc. are all Highway Traffic Act offences not criminal ones. Hit-and-run can be either a HTA or criminal offence.

Hi! You can still come if you have a dentist and no insurance is required or tracked in any way. There is a one-time registration fee of $30 that will cover 1 year of dental cleaning and can be renewed annually If you choose to. The only additional costs are for over 4 x-rays which is determined upon dentist evaluation depending on how long ago your last X-rays were ($4 each or maximum $20 for full mouth series),t2_3r7h7d6h,jen_21,0,1648559035.0,0,t1_i2k53i0,i2k53i0,False,jen_21,t3_tqn5l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Markham/comments/tqn5l0/dental_hygiene_student_looking_for_clients/,DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENT LOOKING FOR CLIENTS INTERESTED IN DENTAL CLEANING,/r/Markham/comments/tqn5l0/dental_hygiene_student_looking_for_clients/i2k53i0/,0,r/Markham,0,0

"Given the right circumstance, I do think there's a legitimate justification for creeping red lights. If the driver and the drivers behind them can time the lights correctly then we would actually see improved traffic conditions. 

In a perfect world, all cars would immediately accelerate synchronously when lights turn green. However, that level of coordination isn't humanly possible for a myriad of reasons (e.g. people being distracted, reaction time, etc.) – not to mention that accelerating takes time. So, we can do the next best thing: begin acceleration early (i.e. creeping). This gives people a head start to coordinate their acceleration and also [saves gas](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/transportation-alternative-fuels/personal-vehicles/fuel-efficient-driving-techniques/21038) since they're not flooring the car. 

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHzzSao6ypE&ab_channel=CGPGrey) is a great explainer for traffic. For further reading, you can also search up concepts like ""phantom traffic"" which demonstrates the butterfly effect that one driver's actions can have. Obviously though, not everyone creeping a red light is doing so because they're trying to improve traffic (heck, I'd say 99% of people who do this have no real rationale), but there is certainly *some* merit to their action regardless of intention.",t2_3ym2p,Burpies,0,1648374018.0,0,t1_i2ao8bt,i2ao8bt,False,Sputr,t3_tllugq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Markham/comments/tllugq/markham_drivers/,Markham Drivers,/r/Markham/comments/tllugq/markham_drivers/i2ao8bt/,1,r/Markham,0,1

"Mandarin... but traditional Chinese for written form...
Best is to learn both spoken language, both have their own history, but mandarin will have more use, for the multi language class provided by the YRSB, there are Mandarin classes in either traditional Chinese or simplified Chinese, simplified Chinese is used in Mainland China, and they have different ""pinyin"" to Tradition Chinese Mandarin, but all in all they are mostly the same spoken wise, and grammar follow the same rules... Tradition Chinese are a bit harder to learn than Simplified Chinese simply because Tradition Chinese are more complicated to write, but they are the true Chinese language in written form(and I'm willing to die on this hill)...
Cantonese will probably be the harder one to learn between the two imo, mainly because they are not spoken as how you write/read, like most other languages, and their ""pinyin"" system is not as good as the ones with Mandarin, very hard to express the ""tone"" with alphabets...",t2_7ynix1f2,FlyinRustBucket,0,1648171330.0,0,t1_i20c7i7,i20c7i7,True,StrangeWedding770,t3_tmw7t4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Markham/comments/tmw7t4/cantonese_mandarin_speaking_residents_can_i_get/,"Cantonese & mandarin speaking residents, can I get your advice on language for baby?",/r/Markham/comments/tmw7t4/cantonese_mandarin_speaking_residents_can_i_get/i20c7i7/,1,r/Markham,0,1

"Yep, I have.

*DISCLAIMER: Before you do this, consider your neighbours. Clover will spread like crazy so if they are the type of people who are always outside working on their lawn, maybe just have a chat with them before you seed.*

So it's actually really easy. I bought my clover from [OSC Seeds](https://www.oscseeds.com/product/white-clover-6735/) \- they come in a bag. You can also order mixed wildflower seed from them if you want it. Basically this spring instead of overseeding with grass, just overseed with clover. Do it early spring once the ground has thawed and that's pretty much all you need to do. Keep the ground damp for a few days as well.

I found that the first year I didn't see too much clover action but year 2 it's everywhere. Just note that clover tends to grow in patches so you'll have to overseed again the following year. No biggie, it's super easy.

"I do and I've noticed a switch in listings recently.  Around 2 weeks ago sale prices increased overnight on homes I'm watching.  A 1.6 Million detached is now listed for 2.1 million.

Homes used to sell quick, within 2 weeks of listing but I see a trend change.  Listing agents are no longer going for lower listing and looking for biding wars.  They are pricing them high and hoping for the best.   I'm watching to see if the final sale price is below listing now.

I went on a walk last week around 3:30pm  just as school ended so quite a lot of people on the streets.

"I am out in Greensborough here (just 1 intersection away), but I guess I really got lucky with our neighbours here who are friendly. Heck, we even did a block party in 2017 (dang, that now feels like a COVID century ago) and dragged the entire street out for an afternoon of meet-the-neighbours fun. My neighbours and I will sit out on the porch and talk all evening - and we are both asians by ethnicity in case you are wondering.

I can attest - never a language barrier but a cultural issue. People are afraid you want or expect something in return when you talk. We tend to have to go above and beyond to even get a response, and this can get tiring. Suggestion - lending a hand, present homemade baked goods - the good ol' bribery tends to work. Also, animals get people talking too as long as your pets are not too naughty! (remember, everyone needs an r/aww)

In my mind - if your neighbours are respectful, mindful of personal space, and make no stink - you have already won. I won the lottery for having awesome neighbours but my brother's overly friendly neighbours (refusing to name ethnicity, but not asian) are borderline stalkers with a NIMBY attitude. He couldn't even get Rogers to repair and bury the cable line because it crossed his neighbour's PUBLIC lawn, and the neighbour petitioned the city to NOT replace his public curb during a repaving of the road.

"You assume that there's some sort of standard that people must adhere to if you live in Canada and that they MUST conform. The entire point of Canada being a diverse nation means that the country is accepting of every culture and not force them to give up theirs. 

Yes, it is illegal dumping, but the act of doing it does not suddenly warrant labeling somebody a fresh immigrant who ""hasn't integrated"". By labeling them an immigrant based on their actions is racist. Your comment also assumes that those you consider to have ""integrated"" do not do this, but in fact if you do a quick search on YouTube there are hundreds of videos of people that do this, namely white people in Canada or USA.

You yourself are a visible minority, so am I and I have lived in Markham for 25 years, so you should also understand the pressures of living in western society and having to conform to these ""norms"" you hold dear.

You missed the point completely. I wouldn’t care if it was placed in the appropriate waste bin.
