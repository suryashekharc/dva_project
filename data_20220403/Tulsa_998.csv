"Anecdotal, but I had a lot to say about Tulsa drivers up until I started regularly driving to Kansas City. I constantly get cut off up there. People will intentionally floor it to cut you off if you use your indicator. None of the posted speed limits actually matter and you'll get in deep shit with other drivers if you're not going at least 10-15 mph over. And hell, that's on the *low end* of what's acceptable. Going 10 over in the far right lane of a 60 mph zone will result in people aggressively overtaking you and/or getting road rage. 

When I have KC passengers in my car they'll constantly say stuff like ""you **have** to cut people off"", ""don't let him/her merge over"", and ""drive really aggressively"". Like, I feel like I have a pretty good balance of defensive/offensive driving skills for Tulsa. I never have (comparable) issues in traffic here. But I get absolutely shit on when I'm driving in Kansas City.

I had a dude lay on his horn because I didn't immediately go on a green at an inner-city intersection. There were pedestrians jay-walking through it. Right in front of me. I could not *conceivably* move forward without mowing people down. The guy then proceeded to follow me for several blocks, occasionally violently shaking his head and making gestures when he thought I was looking.

I had a clean cut soccer mom in a big SUV scream, honk, and make throat slitting gestures at me because I was... swatting at a bee that had made its way into my car. We were at a complete stop at a red light, and my little bee buddy who appeared *after* we had stopped was in no way affecting anything. I still have no clue as to what that was about.

Getting back into Tulsa traffic after driving over there feels like slowly wading into a jacuzzi after having been in an ice bath.

"Siegi's Sausage Factory, Restaurant & Meat Deli. I have had steaks, prime rib, pot roast and tenderloin roast cut to my specifications before. Although I will fully admit I never requested an inch and half cut steak before. I have gotten inch thick ribeyes there many times. They also make sausage there and process wild game.

Their German restaurant is very good as well, restaurant on one side, deli and meat market on the other side, wild game processing in the back.

If you are looking for some Cajun meats you can go to Hebert's/Cajun Ed's. They have Turducken, alligator, crawfish (in season) and other meats. If you are looking for seafood then White River Fish Market or Bodean's Seafood Market.

"Could not agree more. 

This style of bad driving is the absolute worst. Or it's just my personal Kryptonite, I recognize that the ranking is just an opinion. However the drivers are *objectively bad here*. Down to basic decision making even. People just do whatever they want, at any speed they want, wherever they want, in apparently just like, whatever vehicle happened to be on hand. Regardless of condition. The motivations are, I'm sure, also a spectrum of madness. Every bad driver is just like a snowflake, etc. None of them are the same. Or perhaps they're like meals for hobbits. 

You have furious and slow. Furious and fast. Slow and furious. Fast and furious. Slow fast. Illegal Lefters. Incognito Signalling. Stoned. Drunk slow *and* fast. Truck Vaders (a reference to a fantastic meme from a while back). Teenager In Duddy's Car. Motorcycle Enthusiast^TM. Drag Lifers. Salt Lifers. Extremely decadent back-in style aficionados. Blue Lives Matter G Wagon Speaker Phone Women. And last but not least and kind of hard to name cleverly, the ""I'll just come to a complete stop in 50 MPH traffic to let this guy back out of his driveway"" so polite it's dangerous, style driver - ""is that a 4 way stop? No, *you* go first Mr. Left Hand Turn. I'll wait. Now I'll hesitantly move into most of, but not the entire intersection, so we can all be as confused as possible for as long as possible!"" 

And all of those have their own fascinating and horrifying combinations. Not to mention political opinions they are eager to tell you all about via bumper stickers. Some will be surprising. Some not so much. 

Factor in the road conditions, the laughably ubiquitous and never ending road work, and the total lack of planning, and you have a truly special kind of hell that only Oklahoma could produce. It has taken all of the horrible driving techniques from the surrounding regions and through some sort of cultural blood magic, created something wholly diverse and yet instantly recognizable.

"You can't, unfortunately. You have to interview in person, and there aren't any locations in Tulsa. I did mine at DFW, but when I renewed earlier this year, I was able to do my interview remotely. Not sure if the remote option was only available for renewal, but you might want to check.

Also, the process takes several weeks. You have to apply first, then wait for conditional approval, then wait for interview, then wait for the final approval to go through. If you were hoping to walk in somewhere and get it done, you're mistaken, I'm sorry to say. If you like, I can dig through my emails later and find out how long I had to wait for each step.

Also, if you like to get credit cards for the rewards, there are several out there that cover the fee for this. The Chase Sapphire Reserve is probably the best, as you'd get $100 back for the Global entry fee plus $300 back each year on travel expenses, bringing the $550 annual fee down to a more manageable $150, which you'd easily make back in the rewards points accumulated in the first year.",t2_x74cz,redditguysays,0,1648906363.0,0,t1_i33tymj,i33tymj,True,fartsinhissleep,t3_tuio7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tuio7t/where_is_a_tsa_preglobal_entry_enrollment_center/,Where is a TSA pre/global entry enrollment center here?,/r/tulsa/comments/tuio7t/where_is_a_tsa_preglobal_entry_enrollment_center/i33tymj/,10,r/tulsa,0,10

"Tulsa has bashed the officers who serve their City worse than most cities in the USA for at least 30 years now.  You all can have the worst crime stats, gangs, and victims per capita, and I don’t think it will ever matter how much good your officers do, how many people they help, how much they suffer dealing with the absolute disgusting abuse people do to each other there, how many are killed in the line of duty or injured for life while serving for your safety, you all will continue to bash them every chance you get and in any way you can find.  It’s the makeup of your citizens, the way you were brought up, where you were.brought up, what you learned from others around you and chose to adopt.  You will continue to drive out all those you who you really want out there putting their life on the line for your safety, and it will get to the point the only ones willing to sacrifice to serve there are questionable at best.  I remember in the early 90’s the local paper printed something negative about the police every day of the week on the front page.  It would be a citizen remarking something negative about the police.  Example:  I saw two officers speeding with lights on then came upon them a couple miles down the road getting gas.  Never thinking once they had been responding to an officer screaming for help, or citizens with multiple victims and suspects like so many of the gang riots there, one of the many times gang members were looting a store, one of the astronomical armed robberies which occur there, and the officers speeding to responding to help, then enough officers arrived and no others were needed, and they were cancelled, and went back into service.  So they pulled in to gas up to continue responding to your calls for help the remainder of their shift.  When 911 is called, society has failed, the police show up to put pieces of those failures back together the best they can, split second decisions every step of the way, and for money which so few would could live on because they don’t care about the money, they have a calling to put their life on line to clean up societies failures.",t2_26ckb90h,idroveyourvette,0,1648887766.0,0,t1_i3352mk,i3352mk,True,Extension_why_am_he,t3_ttwy7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/ttwy7x/makes_me_disappointed_in_our_law_enforcement/,Makes me disappointed in our law enforcement,/r/tulsa/comments/ttwy7x/makes_me_disappointed_in_our_law_enforcement/i3352mk/,-5,r/tulsa,0,-5

Wait 40 minutes at the bar stools before they go ""Apologies, no one was actually making your lasagna"", and start making it only 40 minutes later.

Back something like 13 years ago they we bought out by the corporation that owns Buffalo Wild Wings. However previously they were owned/conceptualized by the company that owned Mazzio's and Kens Pizza.

"I just moved to Tulsa right at 6 months ago now. I moved from Pittsburg and visited Joplin often enough.

I also didn't enjoy the medical areas around the Pittsburg/Joplin area. Best around in my opinion was the PSU student facility. Just got introduced to a place this last week for my primary care and they're amazing. Would 100% recommend since they leave spots open through the day for people that need sudden availability (great for me with other issues).

There's a small handful of gaming café type places. A few friends have said they're pretty fun and decently priced, and reviews on a couple they recommended seemed to match. Pretty sure there's a couple Discord groups around for gaming communities, though I'm not in any myself as I already have a friend base that I hang out with regularly prior to me moving here. I'm sure that there's some sort of events that happen at the café places, though.

Entry level job would be easy. Almost every place I've eaten is advertising for new employees, so it shouldn't be too much trouble finding something for some secured income while you look for something better if needed.

Any questions I didn't touch on, I sadly don't have a great answer since I'm still fairly new myself.

"\>I'll be happy to either meet you for lunch one day or even out myself by sending you a copy of my LinkedIn profile as proof. Why? Because as I said, the only way to eliminate poverty is to change minds and if my story helps anyone do that, it was worth the risk, to me.

Why would I or anyone be stupid enough to meet up with someone that wants to change my mind without any apparent willingness to change theirs? I'm not taking time out of my day to be talked down to in person by someone who wants to invalidate my experiences while pretending they're somehow inviolable.

\>Lol your version of poverty is obviously very different than mine. Words like ""anxious"" and ""difficult"" aren't even close.

If you want to take home the gold so bad in the suffering olympics, go right on ahead. Making a spectacle out of your own personal challenges and pretending that it gives you the inalienable right to be unquestionably correct in anything you say reflects dimly on you. If any aspect of it is exaggerated or just plain fabricated, then it just makes the conversation worthless altogether. After all, you've already presented your alleged struggles for the purpose of validating your opinions, so why wouldn't you bend the truth or just outright lie to validate them even more?

\>Lol and it pisses me off to that your self-righteous ass thinks that addicts are that way by choice.

I don't care what facts or figures or statistics or peer-reviewed studies you can conjure about the subject. No matter the circumstances, there's always one common denominator: The substance did not come to you. You came to it. You make that selfish decision and you deserve to suffer the consequences of your actions, especially when others have to suffer along with you which always ends up happening. Instead of demanding others to pity and empathize with the addict, why aren't you asking the same for the friends and family members that get roped into that destructive spiral without their consent? Is their pain not valid at all? If so, why haven't you brought it up in conversation?

Speaking of things being brought up in conversation...

\> Are you religious? Based on your attitude, I'm assuming you consider yourself both Republican and Christian. Am I correct?

I'm going to digress for a second. I have to say that I really hate this subreddit. In the last several days, I find myself entangled in arguments with about 3-4 different people and, almost like clockwork, the conversation somehow goes on a tangent about conservatism and Christianity despite me never bringing up my political or religious affiliation. The obsessive hatred and negative bias towards anything conservative and Christian among the users of this subreddit, along with the subsequent grandstanding of atheism that inevitably follows, is so vitriolic and toxic that anytime anyone shares anything that goes against the grain, the immediate reaction is that they must one of those conservative Christian morons. How else can you explain when an argument eventually devolves  into ""What do you think Jesus would think about \*topic\*"" when no one shared what religion, if any, they believe in? The obsessive hatred and compulsive need to paint every negative thing or to rope any disagreeable thing as being affiliated with, or derived from conservatism or Christianity in this subreddit is fucking pathetic, quite frankly, and you just nonchalantly outed yourself as being just as pathetic. You'll rally against any other form of obsessive hatred and bias towards any other group of people or different concepts, but your hate gets a free pass?

As I alluded to earlier, you're not worth my time. If you think your way of helping society is so much better than mine, feel free to take your supposed $100k income and dedicate it all to non-profit social programs. As you stated, based on your ""experience,"" their problems can ""totally be solved by throwing money blindly to it,"" and you know that's what Jesus would want, seeing as you want to flex how much you know about him and the parable of the rich man despite being atheist because you're just so intelligent. By all fucking means, lead by your example and show me a fucking thing or two. Whenever I stop seeing homelessness and addiction in plain view in the streets of Tulsa, then I'll change my mind.

">I'm really not inclined to believe everything you described about yourself.  

I'll be happy to either meet you for lunch one day or even out myself by sending you a copy of my LinkedIn profile as proof. Why? Because as I said, the only way to eliminate poverty is to change minds and if my story helps anyone do that, it was worth the risk, to me.

>I've been put in difficult positions in my life before. I know what it's like to roll up pennies and then choose between food and gasoline. I know what it's like to become anxious when my car makes some new and unfamiliar noise or when a cop pulls up behind me when I damn well know I don't have any insurance.

Lol your version of poverty is obviously very different than mine. Words like ""anxious"" and ""difficult"" aren't even close. 

How many times have you been woken up from a dead sleep and immediately got into a fight because someone was trying to steal your only pair of shoes? How many times have you seen friends beaten or arrested by the police because they refused to give them a blowjob? My guess is zero to both. Unfortunately, I can't say the same.

>A major reason on how I got from there to now is because of the choices I made. Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I took initiative. 

The piece you are missing here is that you had the knowledge, skillset, and courage to actually recognize the options available. Not everyone does.

>I studied what others did, and I applied their lessons to my situation.

And here we have another clue that you have never been truly poor.  When you are truly poor, those positive lessons are hard to find. People who are truly poor are in survival mode. They are often desperately concerned with saving what they can in the hopes of making it to the next month. Their role models are often drug dealers and thieves because those are the only people around them who can consistently keep their bills paid. It's a completely different mindset.

Unfortunately, you can't ""save"" your way out of poverty. You have to actually increase your income because at best, saving is just letting you tread water. 

However, if you have 2-3 jobs and are working 60+ hours a week and still just barely scraping by, when do you have the time for school? At the end of the day, you are just so bone tired that even reading a book is a huge undertaking.

>There was a lot of time spent flinging things on the wall and seeing what stuck and what didn't,

This is yet another indicator that you don't truly understand ""poor.""  Time is a luxury one doesn't have when it takes 2-3 jobs to keep the bills paid.

>Everyone knows that excessive alcohol consumption leads to ruin even if they don't have alcoholics in their lives to reference off of like I did, and it pisses me off, quite frankly, for you to make it out like as if being tempted by the bottle is a natural expectation and not the indication of weakmindedness or ignorance.

Lol and it pisses me off to that your self-righteous ass thinks that addicts are that way by choice. 

No one ""chooses"" to be an addict. It's a physiological and psychological medical condition. It's often genetic and many people don't even realize that their social drinking has turned into alcoholism until it's far too late to go back.

>Had you ended up a hopeless alcoholic, I'd have no sympathy for you.
>... 

> All I'd expect out of anyone in those situations is that if you don't have the willpower or strength to beat your addiction, then at least have the dignity of taking responsibility for your choices and suffer in silence instead of roping others in and make them pay for your poor choices like I see others do.

You are quite the arrogant ass. Now you got me curious. Are you religious? Based on your attitude, I'm assuming you consider yourself both Republican and Christian. Am I correct?

I'm actually an atheist. However, if you are religious, I hope for your sake that Jesus didn't hear you say that because my understanding is that judging is a pretty serious sin. Whatever happened to helping those less fortunate? Whatever happened to ""easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven, etc?""

Oh right, like most ""christians"" I know, you like the idea of Christianity. You like talking the talk and thinking of yourself as a ""good person."" However, when it comes to walking the walk, you are far more concerned with your own selfish and arrogant ass than you are with actually following the teaching of your faith.

It's telling when an Atheist has more compassion for those around them than you do. I hope, for your sake, that you never end up needing someone like me to help you. 

Why? Not because I wouldn't help you. I would because it's the right thing to do. No, it's because even if I'm not a big enough prick to make it happen, the world would be a far better place if people like you weren't in it.",t2_eeplh,Sick_of_your_shit_,0,1648851208.0,0,t1_i31fnes,i31fnes,False,Midwest__Misanthrope,t3_tt3q19,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tt3q19/what_a_difference_a_five_minute_drive_down_the/,What a difference a five minute drive down the road will do.,/r/tulsa/comments/tt3q19/what_a_difference_a_five_minute_drive_down_the/i31fnes/,1,r/tulsa,0,1

"	“People are quick to place blame on authority figures for the treatment of mentally ill”

Really? People hold authority figures accountable for their own actions? Well blow me down thats just about the most ludicrous thing Ive every heard of. Why should police officers be held accountable for their own actions? Shouldnt they be immune from all consequences? They only wield an insane amount of almost unchecked power and discretion over normal citizens lives while simultaneously being automatically considered believable and credible. I cant imagine why we would want too hold those people accountable for something silly like assault and battery and perjury.

How are police supposed to keep us all safe if they arent allowed to [Checks notes] 
1) intentionally and purposefully escalate an already dangerous situation into one that is almost certain to cause violent outcomes and then falsely claim it was the citizen who was at fault, 
2) gleefully laugh with other officers about how much fun it is going to be to beat a mentally ill person up,

"> I don’t see how her family should be responsible for the choices the officers made.

Regardless of whatever decision the officers made, the reason why police were even called to her was due to her erratic and bizarre behavior in the presence of the public. She presented a liability to not only herself, but the business she was in and the people that were around her. 

Obviously, the reason why she acted so erratic and bizarre was due to her well-documented mental illness, which then begs the question of where were the people that were meant to take care of her and why was she out on her own if she was as mentally ill as described.

"Why was she by herself out in public? 

If her legal representation hired by her family is so keen to putting out press releases that describes her mental illness, then why was a mentally ill person allowed to be out by herself? 

Did her family not assume she would be such a big liability on herself, let alone others, or were they frustrated with her behavior and basically turned her loose out on the streets to be someone else's problem just like the grand majority of the mentally ill homeless on the streets right now? Are they only giving the impression that they care for and love her now that there's a potential for a big legal payout?

"It's safe, but I wouldn't wander to the west. Most of the homeless services are in the NW corner of the downtown area, so there are going to be a lot of downtrodden people hanging around, not that most of them are ""dangerous"" or anything. 

Directly to the East of the venue is Saturn Room, an awesome tiki bar. 
For dive bars, Soundpony is interesting and has all kinds of weird music come through, and Caz's is always a hoot. 

For more upscale, Valkyrie is great and Roof 66 obviously has a great view (it's more of a walk though since it's in the Blue dome district a couple miles away). 

For night life, St. Vitus is about the only proper club. There's also Club Majestic but I believe it is more of an LGBT+ hangout? 

If you want to venture out a little bit outside of downtown, some of the best eats in Tulsa are in a little district called Cherry Street which isn't far from downtown. Nola's, Kilkenny's, Smoke, ect... all amazing.

"That part of town is super safe, and a really fun place to hang out!

From the Tulsa Theater, you'll be pretty close to Welltown Brewing, which is a popular local brewery with a nice rooftop patio. If you like more upscale cocktails, Valkyrie is also pretty good. For bars with live music, The Hunt Club is really close to there, as well as Duet (if you like jazz).

There's also a ton of good restaurants near there, depending on what kind of food you like. Personally, I really like Que Gusto (empanadas), Sisserou's (Caribbean), and Laffa (medi-eastern).

You'll also be really close to the Blue Dome District, which has even more options for nightlife and restaurants. Some of my favorites here would be: McNellies, Fassler Hall, The Max, and Peacemaker. Also, the rooftop bar at the Hotel Indigo (Roof Sixty-Six) has great views of the city (you can get a drink there even without staying at the hotel).

Do you know how often someone with a mental health issue gets their head slammed into the ground by tpd? Because hitting their head seems to be a go to move. 

You do know concussions cause long term damage, right? But I bet you would only care if it was your friend, kid or mom. 

The mentally ill are people too, and when previously documented, it’s an officers responsibility to de-escalate. 

I’m not saying there are never circumstances in which a mentally ill person should end up injured. Yes, officers should put their safety first.

But even if de escalation doesn’t work, that does not give officers the right to intentionally bully people into action.

If someone inside a bathroom is having an episode and hearing voices, already has a fear of the police, and the police are banging on the door, shaking it, laughing, saying “THIS IS FUN, he’s gonna taze her!”

That wouldn’t help ANYONES state during arrest and honestly puts the officers at a higher risk than her keeping her fat lips shut.

Hold more than one thought at a time. You can care about the mentally ill and still care about an officers wellbeing too, but there is crossover of maintaining respectable interactions that creates a higher likelihood of safety for all involved.",t2_5yeupgm,OutInMyElement,0,1648828363.0,0,t1_i2zwaa3,i2zwaa3,False,OKC89ers,t3_trpshz,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/trpshz/latest_controversial_arrest_by_tpd_this_one/,"Latest controversial arrest by TPD, this one during a bipolar manic episode",/r/tulsa/comments/trpshz/latest_controversial_arrest_by_tpd_this_one/i2zwaa3/,1,r/tulsa,0,1

"Maybe you weren't around for the many substantial anti war protests in 2003. In Tulsa. At 41 and Yale there were protests for weeks with many people. Iraq happened anyway.

Russia had no legitimate concerns. NATO is strictly a defensive organization. There is zero threat to Russian sovereignty. The only way NATO would engage with Russia is if it started a choice l conflict with a NATO country.

War is bad, but defending your nation is imperative. Ukraine needs help and it's right to give them help. We cannot allow Russia to take territory. Germany was allowed to take the sudentenland. Russia was allowed to take Crimea. Germany later invaded Poland. Russia later invaded Ukraine. Germany later took control of most of Europe. Russia can't be allowed to take Ukraine out any other territory. It's not war mongering to defend free peoples against an aggressor who seeks to take territory by force.

Poverty is cyclical.  If someone grows up in poverty, that is all they know.  So unless someone comes into their life and shows them another way, chances are they will remain in poverty.  They may not see the value in finishing high school because adults in their life never did.  And if they finish HS, they may not know how to apply for college/tech school because adults in their life never did.  They may not know how to get a mortgage because adults in their life never did.  In addition, if they get that far, they may not know how to invest their money because none of the adults in their life ever did.

"You assume malice where there is none. I have no disdain for any form of spirituality that someone follows. If it grants them serenity and peace of mind while not causing any harm to the populace, then by all means, people can believe what they wish.

Your argument seems to be that there is no effect on society. Please correct me if this is incorrect and we can certainly debate about that. I do not 'blame' everything on Christianity alone, but it informs your point of view.

>People always have choices, including how to react when things get difficult. When someone loses their job and faces financial difficulty, for example, they have multitudes of choices and each with their own consequences.

Let's work from this example.

>Some take short-term positions to keep money coming in, some mope and turn to blaming others or engages in substance abuse or reacts in a way that's unproductive and destructive

This presents a binary argument. The choices presented are only ""work harder"" or ""do drugs"". Clearly, these are not the only choices available. It makes several assumptions.

1. The loss of the previous job is not because of injury or illness and the individual can continue to work.
2. That work is available. We can agree that currently this isn't much of an issue with the labor market being down.
3. That said work provides a sustainable income. This is far less certain. Much of the currently available work is only slightly better than minimum wage. If a person is single, lives with others who likewise work, and sustains themselves on cheaply available food, then there is a plausible argument to be made.
4. There are *zero* unexpected occurrences. The person does not fall ill and miss any time at work. That no accident can occur in or out of work. That no financial setbacks *can* occur to this person.
5. Finally, that it is possible to advance within this work-space. That it is not a 'dead end job'. This is often not the case for many of the described jobs above. It is only possible to sustain oneself on such a job, but there are no options for furthering oneself, to 'pull oneself up' as it is said.

Do other possibilities exist within this continuum? Certainly. Perhaps they find a well-paying job instead of sustenance-only living. But that requires a certain amount of fortune in timing, or possibly knowing the right people, or hoping that someone will give them a chance.

>And, quite frankly, I'm sick of this narrative that I have a moral obligation to feel sorry and to pity the person who made the wrong choices. I'm sick of people trying to manipulate me into giving these people attention and sympathy, or even money or resources, all because they don't want to help themselves even though they're more than capable, all because they want the easy way at the expense of others.

You're assuming, still, that circumstances are arrayed *just so.* That these nameless and faceless individuals *are* capable. But this leaves out a large swath that are not so fortunate. Someone who has suffered a severe traumatic injury may not be capable of working in the same sort of job, in the same sort of field. Does this person deserve to suffer for a quirk of happenstance?

Perhaps they have a family that depends on them, which again sets them even further back. Food still needs to be bought. Housing still needs to be paid for. Clothes still need to be provided, especially if there are children involved. They do not stop growing because it is inconvenient.

Are we supposed to tell these people 'sorry you couldn't survive, we aren't going to help' and let them suffer?

According to Jesus, no.

"I'm really not inclined to believe everything you described about yourself, but in spite of your descriptive and self-absorbed rant, you're not the only one who's risen from poverty and a difficult past. You don't own the copyright to that.  


I've been put in difficult positions in my life before. I know what it's like to roll up pennies and then choose between food and gasoline. I know what it's like to become anxious when my car makes some new and unfamiliar noise or when a cop pulls up behind me when I damn well know I don't have any insurance. I didn't have anyone to rely on and, ironically, I had others reliant on me that should have been taking care of themselves.  


A major reason on how I got from there to now is because of the choices I made. Instead of feeling sorry for myself, I took initiative. I studied what others did, and I applied their lessons to my situation. There was a lot of time spent flinging things on the wall and seeing what stuck and what didn't, and not every decision was a winner, and mistakes were made, but I wasn't out there saying to myself ""that shot of whiskey looks pretty nice right now"" like you supposedly did because, despite all that I didn't know, I knew what awaited me at the end of that road. Everyone knows that excessive alcohol consumption leads to ruin even if they don't have alcoholics in their lives to reference off of like I did, and it pisses me off, quite frankly, for you to make it out like as if being tempted by the bottle is a natural expectation and not the indication of weakmindedness or ignorance.   


Had you ended up a hopeless alcoholic, I'd have no sympathy for you. You had choices and you made poor ones.

"I know this subreddit has such an obsessive hatred with anything even remotely to do with evangelical Christianity, but to try and rope everything you disagree with as being derived of it in some way, shape, or form not only demonstrates a lack of objectivity on your part, personally, but it highlights an almost compulsive need to tie everything socially wrong as being the result of evangelism when all these problems are too complicated and nuanced to be blamed on one singular thing.  


That being said, I'm not blind to the idea that unfortunate things happen to people, but everyone has choices on how to react. Some react positively and manage to overcome whatever obstacles they face, and some react negatively and end up letting problems fester and try to deflect personal accountability by blaming other factors. This is a matter of resilience.   


People always have choices, including how to react when things get difficult. When someone loses their job and faces financial difficulty, for example, they have multitudes of choices and each with their own consequences.

"Speaking as someone who was homeless 20 years ago and is now making over $100K/year, you have obviously never been poor.

That shit is hard. It's like grind you to the bone hard. It's so hard that when you know everything is fucked and you already know you won't be able to pay this month's bills anyway, that bottle of alcohol looks really fucking good hard. You start living for the simple pleasures that those with more money take for granted.

I remember spending my last $50 on a motel room for the night because I just couldn't bear the thought of spending another night under my bridge. I couldn't resist the lure of a hot shower and a bed that I wasn't worried about getting robbed or stabbed in. It's impossible to understand if you haven't been in that situation.

You are constantly under stress. Is this the month you won't make rent? Or is this just one of those months you have to call and beg to keep your lights on. Nope, this month I managed to pay rent and electricity! All I had to do is skip a few meals myself to make sure my kids had food. 

God help you if your pos vehicle breaks down because you damn sure can't afford to fix it. This means you have to take a day off of work, which means no pay, which throws you even further behind, which makes that shot of whisky look just that much better at the end of the day...or hell, why wait until the end of the day? You might as well take that shot when you wake up since you know you're completely fucked anyway.

>People really need to move away from this notion that poverty is like some communicable disease that anyone can catch through no fault of their own.

People really need to wake the fuck up and realize that when poverty is all you have ever known, you don't have any fucking bootstraps to pull on. 

Think of it like giving someone a job as a carpenter when they have never seen wood, and then expecting them to just figure shit out. It is literally impossible to pull yourself out of poverty on your own. It can't happen and anyone who says otherwise is either lying or completely fucking delusional. Many people simply don't have the knowledge to even know where to start doing what's necessary.

>You'd be an absolute fool to think this problem can be fixed by blindly throwing money and resources at it.

Actually, no. 99% of the problems in the world could easily be solved by throwing money at it. How do I know this? Because 99% of my problems back when I was homeless went away when I started making real money. 

Rather than getting rousted in the middle of the night by the police because they were bored and didn't have shit else to do, they call me sir when we interact. Rather than being so stressed out over pretty much everything that i banged my head into the shower and gave myself a bald spot on the back of my head, I can relax and just enjoy the steam. Rather than paying stupid high interest rates on my unreliable pos car because of my shitty credit, my under-warranty vehicle has a 0% loan on it.

Yes, you will have to add in a bit of training, and not everyone will succeed, but the vast majority would be far better off overall than they are now if we simply provided a universal basic income, regardless of employment status.

Let's be honest here.  The vast majority of the world's problems right now are caused by simple human greed. The wealthy hoard while everyone else suffers. Then those who are doing ok think hmmm...better support the greed because I want my share of the hoard, not realizing that a snowball has a better chance of surviving in hell than they do of ever reaching that level of wealth. However, they continue grinding away at their job until they are too old to actually enjoy whatever wealth the managed to accumulate, assuming they are ever actually able to retire. 

The key to solving poverty is for those who aren't currently experiencing it to realize that they are lucky and that all it takes is one bad day and you can lose everything. Once they really feel that deep in their core, we can start to make changes.

The term was coined by people who use mental health services in an attempt to empower those with mental health issues, historically considered a marginalized segment of society.

"Depends on the company and their pay structure and what you haul.

Some companies pay by the mile, typically over the road. Others pay by the ton, could be over the road grain haulers or local rock hauling. And some pay by the hour.

I personally work for a local construction company and get paid by the hour. While the hourly rate isn't the best out there, there is plenty of available overtime. 6 days a week, 50-65 hours a week is pretty standard.

Obviously you'll make more if you own your own equipment, but then you have to pay for all of the fuel/repairs/insurance/fines/etc yourself.",t2_7zuinhm6,turn_er,0,1648794629.0,0,t1_i2yb6s0,i2yb6s0,True,ExtraRandom1,t3_tta0ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tta0ge/cdl_driver/,Cdl driver,/r/tulsa/comments/tta0ge/cdl_driver/i2yb6s0/,1,r/tulsa,0,1

">Poverty is seen as a nuisance while we also expect it to magically fix itself without an actual plan to diagnose the causes and it’s effects on future generations living within it.

There is a solution, it's just that many who are impoverished don't want to embrace the solution. Simple things such as not doing drugs or avoid excessive alcohol consumption or working your way up the ladder at any job and actually having goals worth striving for every day and practicing birth control so you wont be bogged down with taking care of children you weren't emotionally or economically ready to take care of.

People really need to move away from this notion that poverty is like some communicable disease that anyone can catch through no fault of their own. The fact is that staying out of poverty for most requires a level of discipline that keeps you from doing risky and potentially disastrous things and to realize that getting your rocks off through drugs, alcohol and sexual promiscuity has the potential to ruin your life and the lives of others, such as the kids that end up being the product of such risky behavior and ends up being raised by grandparents or uncles or spends all their youths in DHS custody. Being born in a rich family isn't the only way to avoid poverty like some would have you believe. You can start from the bottom and work your way out to something better.

I don't doubt that there may very well be people that are stuck in poverty because of issues they have no control or influence over, nor have they ever. People who have medical conditions or physical and mental disorders that they were either born with or came about without drug or alcohol use being a factor. However, you'd be just completely ignorant to think that the grand majority of those who live in public housing out near 61st and Peoria, or anywhere for that matter, fit in that category.

However you think the problem should be fixed or whether you agree with me or not, one thing is for certain: You'd be an absolute fool to think this problem can be fixed by blindly throwing money and resources at it.",t2_55bp18ay,RememberedOldBuddy,0,1648787747.0,0,t1_i2y0u6r,i2y0u6r,False,Midwest__Misanthrope,t3_tt3q19,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulsa/comments/tt3q19/what_a_difference_a_five_minute_drive_down_the/,What a difference a five minute drive down the road will do.,/r/tulsa/comments/tt3q19/what_a_difference_a_five_minute_drive_down_the/i2y0u6r/,-22,r/tulsa,0,-22
