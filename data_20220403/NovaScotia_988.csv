"A waste of tax payer money being spent on a man's military collection that you can see in any museum such as Citadel Hill. An innocent collector with spent shells and wall hangers. If the grenades still had there explosives intact then take them or just simply empty them. When you see these items in a museum setting I think it would be pretty easy to take them if you wanted to as most have them placed behind a rope and sometimes a person to explain the history of the items which could easily be distracted by talking to someone and another person could just grab it. I guess they better shutdown the museums or Citadel Hill as they have fun powder to shoot the noon canon daily. You can clearly see he has spent rounds that are empty. I never knew there was a law saying you can't collect brass and liable it ammunition. He doesn't have a tank to shoot the rounds.

"I see comments on here whenever this comes up about drugs/violence and all I can say is that it’s like any other place in NS and in all of Canada for that matter… if you’re involved in that kind of life then you’ll find those problems.

If you aren’t and live in a nice area (I see you mention looking over by the NSCC which is a nice family friendly area) then it’s great. Much more affordable real estate than the rest of the province and all the basic amenities you need. Is the mall a bit lame and is there a lack of restaurants? Yes - but the basics are still there.

For a young family you can’t beat it. Everything is close by and there is a slower pace of life compared to HRM.

"Less crime/drugs than Halifax but that's almost 500k people now and a lot of economic pressure being put on locals so frustrations are rising and competition for gangs is increasing for a bigger piece of the pie.

Yarmouth would probably be similar to Sydney/New Waterford/Glace Bay. It's also a port town closer to the US so alot of the drugs coming through the province would land there on fishing vessels and other boats.

"Hey there, I lived in Yarmouth from age 10 to 20, and it was a terrible place for me growing up. It was 1993, to 2003, so I admit it's been a long time and things may have changed, but from what I see from Facebook school friends, it's not any better.

As a kid, you have to drive/be driven everywhere. It's all spread out and not walkable. We lived in town (*north end*), but went to the county junior high, so no walking to school. The Prince and the Cat ferries were still running when I lived there, and that was a huge boost to the town, its been in disarray ever since they were discontinued. 

I think you said you'd be moving there for a job at the hospital? That may afford you a nicer lifestyle with good opportunities for your kids. My folks had good jobs too and it was still terrible.

It was terribly racist, I remember racial slurs were common in some households, and in schools. Again, it's been like 20 years, hopefully it has changed.

"Yarmouth is a town I hold close to my heart. I grew up there in the mid 80s to mid 90s, when my parents divorced we moved but my dad stayed there. The town used to be amazing but unfortunately what was once the richest town in North America soon became a typical have not town because of sheer political abuse and bad decisions.

The town has a lot of room to improve but is slowly making steps, and could make larger ones if the council and Mayor were replaced. Some of them milk the town dry.

The south end isn't bad like it used to be. It's ignored, but a lot of the town is unless the big influencers live there. If money were put into the roads instead of cut outs and metal structures down town it would improve the town greatly, and if a clean up project was implemented it would improve the quality look of the town. 

As it stands now I believe the area that's the center of the town is the most shady. To add to this all the murders mentioned actually happened out of town around the places mentioned that should be moved to.

I believe around the NSCC is probably a good bet though.",t2_1432ow,86Eagle,0,1648911795.0,0,t1_i3450ic,i3450ic,True,Snozaz,t3_tugnac,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaScotia/comments/tugnac/whats_it_like_living_in_yarmouth/,What's it like living in Yarmouth?,/r/NovaScotia/comments/tugnac/whats_it_like_living_in_yarmouth/i3450ic/,2,r/NovaScotia,0,2

"I think it was the elementary school. It was almost 9 yrs ago though so things could be better now.  When we were there most everything had shut down from the ferry to maine being shut down. So unemployment was a major issue unless like someone else stated you worked in certain sectors. 

To be fair also we ended up living in a not so great part of yarmouth without even realizing it until it was already to late. 

The apartment building we were in was very good at hiding the less than savory aspects initially. When the incident with the old lady yelling at me about my kid happened the landlord moved us to a different unit to smooth everything over. At the time my son and I was only visiting my husband as I was 36 weeks pregnant and was staying with my parents until I gave birth. Our kids and I officially moved down when our baby was 4 days old.  Unfortunately when he moved our units he put us beside a drug dealer. They used their balcony as a dumpster, would open the sliding door to let their dog shit and piss on the balcony on top of the literal garbage and shitty diapers from their kids. They evicted them after finding out they would leave to go party and was leaving their infant and 3 yr old home alone. We had to tape over any unused outlets to keep their pot smoke from seeping into our apartment. 

The night the 2 men tried to bust in, I actually blame myself and learned a very valuable lesson that night.  I was up feeding our new born and heard someone running down the hall knocking on door yelling something, I thought there was a fire or something and they were trying to warn people as the week before someone burnt something in their oven at like 2am  in the lower half of the building and filled the entire building with smoke and the alarms never went off.  So I woke my husband and asked him to have a look. He peaked out and seen 2 men standing at the drug neighbours door (after they were evicted) and they seen him and walked towards him. He thought they had been in an accident by the way they walked but quickly realized they were intoxicated. They asked him for a smoke, he said they he doesn't smoke. Then wanted cocaine and he again said that he doesn't do or have drugs. Then they asked what he would do if they punched him, he had the door braced with his foot and he is a very large man, they then asked ""where is your girlfriend?"" We had never met these people before... Then suddenly they were trying to shove their way in while threatening him. I had already picked up the phone and dialed 911. I screamed that I called the police and that was enough to scare them off. They ran and we watched as they almost ditched their car fleeing. The cops came and all they did was lecture us on my stupidity and said ""you don't open doors to people you don't know, especially here."" They went on to talk about the drug and violence problem. 

There was a constant turn over of tenants around us as well. The apartment below us in those 6 months had 5 different tenant move in and then move back out. The neighbour to our right changed twice. First it was the woman who screamed at her 3 yr old all day. Then it was a family of like 6 people who turned out to be hoarders. The kind of hoarders you see on tlc.  When my husband packed up everything to move home he said they came over and took anything he would let them have including the actual garbage.

I moved from a very small place in rural Newfoundland (1200 people to be exact) to Yarmouth 22 years ago and love it here. When my parents came to live with us to work they also loved it here.

"Lived there 6 months. Hated every single second. Lots of drugs. Lots of violence.

We lived near the school and routinely seen people so intoxicated they would be falling over while trying to walk down the side walks. 

It rained constantly with major thunderstorms. It was cold and dreary 90% of the time.  Never seen anyone smiling. People were rude and snobbish.

"You'll have to forgive the locals of this sub. They make a habit of taking our their frustrations on people from away. Especially when they share ideas they've not yet heard of or when discussing housing.

It's not that they're mean, they're just doing what people do when they're coping with their life's choices when things don't go so well: blaming everyone else. If it is any consolation, most of them are nice and polite in real life and would probably make great neighbours.

As far as a Barndominium goes, I know exactly what you're talking about. A client of mine, who is an artist, living in Lunenburg suggested this was the idea he was looking for when I renovated a decommissioned church for he and his partner (2016). 

A former developer and colleague of mine used this same concept when re-developing a larger mixed commercial/residential building in town on the waterfront (2015). The upstairs flats somewhat satisfy the barndominium idea. The mix of massive old beams, reclaimed wood floors with an industrial finishing turned out beautifully.

The Lunenburg - Chester area of Nova Scotia is a great place for this. 1.1 hour drive from Halifax. Lots of people from all over the world. Good mix of young and old and diverse demographics. The locals are very accustomed to people from everywhere especially the USA, UK, Lebanon, Greece and Germany.

Property is available, but sometimes you need a bit of an inside contact. I've purchased several choice lots over the years thanks to knowing the seller's families. A good place to start would be by contacting Stephanie DeVries. She knows everyone who knows everyone in real estate here. She also knows the contractors and suppliers.

Kingsburg and Petite Riviere still have quite a few places with great big barns that could be converted and I wouldn't be surprised to find a few more rural churches go up for residential purchase too over the next several years. The area outside of Lunenburg from Centre to Bridgewater has quite a bit of uninhabited land too.

I was told the company made a total of 750 million dollars in profits last year. I haven’t googled this, just heard from my higher ups. 

Speaking of which, we had a regional manager tell us that the prices go up because of shipping prices. Apparently it costs an arm and a leg to ship anything these days. That, apparently, it went from costing “300 dollars to 8000 dollars to ship certain products”. Again, I don’t know if this is true, just word of mouth. 

And the ones working the tills hate asking for charitable donations.

"I’ve used these kinds of “helps” before. Absolute. Garbage. Help. The “help” made my situation worse. Granted that  was a long time ago, hopefully things have improved. 

The website for Togetherall says both that it is free for all Nova Scotians, in two places, and later that it is accessible to Nova Scotians aged 16-29. I don’t hold out a lot of hope for this janky website and the “help” it will provide.

From the website: (all on the landing page)

“Free mental health support in minutes, available to all Nova Scotia residents aged 16 or older”

“Who can access Togetherall?
Togetherall is free to all Nova Scotia residents over the age of 16.”

“Who can access Togetherall and how much does it cost?

"Oh wow. Yeah a lot has changed on 6 years for sure. The wooden monkey, envie, heartwood, Springhouse and wild leek all have good vegan options. Personally, I like Real Fake Meats, a ton of super delicious food from burgers to fries, sometimes milkshakes, Mac and cheese, chocolate bars, etc. G street pizza has good vegan pizza and even donairs and poutine. Easy street diner has a good smoked tofu sandwich and desserts. There’s a soft serve place out in tantallon in the summer with lots of options. Wok your way (Dartmouth) has an entire vegan side menu and it’s very good. Battery park (Dartmouth) has good tacos and salad, stone pizza (Dartmouth) also has some good options, there’s also lots of little snacks here and there like at the bread lounge, they have croissants and chocolate bread and mousse, Syd delicious cookies, also that food stand at Shubie park had a ton of vegan options, most middle eastern places have options. I really like Indochine Banh Mi on spring garden, really good tofu chicken in their Banh mi, good smoothies too. I’m definitely forgetting a ton. I lived in Yarmouth and every time I go there, there’s usually only a few options: Jakes pizza, them ^, and the Shanty. I usually have to just buy groceries at Sobeys and live off that. Really not much beyond that unfortunately so once you’ve tried it, it becomes repetitive. That’s what I like about a majority of those places I mentioned in HFX, they switch up their menus all the time too.

"This was ruined by the egos of the Annapolis County council and nothing else.

For anyone not in the know the last county cao set this deal up but due to some other shady goings on he was ousted (long story made short). It was under him that this whole deal was created and the school really was coming.

Queue a few months after he was ousted and pretty well the rest of the county council was replaced. If you don't know already the area around Annapolis Royal share these people are from is chock full of egotistical, wealthy, snooty assholes and that's pretty well who was in AND who replaced them. 

And since the whole deal was set up by the previous management they saw every little part of it as evil while ignoring the fact that the deal was set up with the long haul in mind for the local communities. But this wasn't good enough so they whined so bad that the lawyers danced in and completely and utterly fucked everything up.

Also this is not the first time that similar has happened. There is a reason why New Minas has grown so fast while Annapolis Royal sits in 1764 and the Upper Clements Park ended up dying.

They squandered every option they had and picked the worst possible decisions and ran with them.

"You do understand that taxing alcohol won’t make people stop drinking alcohol right? What makes people stop drinking alcohol is having the free time and economic breathing room to do some self reflection or reach out to community supports (having literally any reason to live into the future helps as well). This “tax it so it seems less desirable” approach isn’t super effective, it’s just a tax on some of the most economically disparaged people in the province. People would still buy beer if it was $90/case. They might even brew their own.

This is a symptom of our lack of social funding, alcohol taxes would be good in theory if the money was earmarked specifically for bolstering the healthcare system but that’s not the reality of things. It’s just being used to further forestall the taxation of businesses in fear of losing middle class voters.

"This was a scam from top to bottom. The only difference between this and other scams like the Port Hawkesbury space bridge to nowhere is a few fools outside of government thought it was real.

Here is a simple set of formulas the government could use to run far better:

* If any organization comes along and needs grants of anything they are lying scam artists.  Full stop.

* If NSP is saying something they are lying. If they ask for something, think about making what they are asking for illegal. If they demand something do the exact opposite.

* If a company comes along with all the money it needs to get going and just begs for the red tape to be cut that don't involve environmental regulations then seriously think about cutting that red tape for everyone.

* If a company hires any of the top Halifax law firms as it begins to try doing business in NS then make whatever that company is doing illegal and tell all senior bureaucrats to not take their calls or those of the top law firms (lobbyists).

* If people start putting up signs all over Nova Scotia for what is a local issue then fire all bureaucrats who green lit that project.

And as a yearly exercise:

* Fire 30% of all medical administrators.
* Fire 10% of all government staff paid more than 100k.
* Fire 30% of all government staff paid more than 150k.
* Fire 100% of all staff with communications or relations in their title.
* Fire 10% of all government staff regardless of pay band.
* Cut one government department.

I wonder how long it will take until it's not moderated by anyone. Just like most things in Nova Scotia, they'll start off strong and then eventually slow down to a point when it just dies and rots away, then 15 years later they'll start it up again.

"Beer is fast, cheaper, and easier. We've collected 600 ml bottles, so the bottling isn't too bad, and the capper is a lot easier than our floor corker. It's also faster from bottling to drinkable. We don't keg it, so it's not always as sparkling as commercial brews, but YMMV.

> The Jenkins family, who had been in touch with the MacBurnies and McLeod&#039;s two daughters, had also been calling looking for information and eventually decided to drive from their home in Pictou County, arriving in Wentworth around 4:40 p.m. They returned home without answers.

">The drowning rate (per 100,000) in Ontario floats between 1.1 to 1.4 on average, whereas in NS the rate is already 1.4 for 2022  
 even though we're only three months in. On average, twice as many   
people drown in NS than in Ontario (per capita). And this year is on   
track to be extra high.

Your quoting the Ontario Drowning Report for your first point and an arbitrary google search for your NS point. This is not a good comparison.

Furthermore the Lifesaving Society's drowning reports are liberally skewed by about five years, and generally have a higher drowning rate until a medical examiner or corner report deems the cause of death was drowning. In a nut shell, picture an old man walking down the beach with his feet in the water, has a heart attack, and dies. The LS Drowning report will label that as a drowning until the medical examiner report comes back that the cause of death was a heart attack. This is why the [National Drowning Report](https://www.lifesavingsociety.com/media/330352/lifesaving_drowning-2020_can_en_2020.pdf) is current to 2017. When composing these, the Lifesaving Society bases most their findings off media reports until they get the final documentation. 

Also if anyone's wondering, it does not include homicides or suicides. So cities with bridges like Halifax, Montreal, Windsor, etc won't have skewed data for anyone jumping off the bridge.

"Hubbard's, Mahone Bay and Chester are beautiful coastal towns within an hour of Halifax. Great small town vibe with lots of retirees.

"Yeah if you are thinking of a specific area ask the locals what their wait times are like for er and other services.  It's not uncommon to have month or years waits for knee and hip surgeries, there is often only specialists in Halifax and they have multiple year wait lists.  Some hospitals don't do orthopedic surgeries so if you break a hip or bone you may be shipped across province for surgery.  If you go really rural it can be an hour + for an ambulance.  No one wants to think this can happen to them, but if you are retirement age it's important to think ahead as you are likely to need more hospital care as you age.  You don't want to discover as you have a heart attack  or stroke that the closest ambulance is an hour away and your local hospital doesn't have a specialized cardiac or stroke units.

"[Drowning trends are changing](https://www.lifesavingsociety.com/media/330352/lifesaving_drowning-2020_can_en_2020.pdf) and shifting away from the 16 - 35 year old crowed and into the 50+ crowed. That said drownings peaked in 2008 and again in 2012 but have averaged out to a decline. What tends to happen is government agencies put forward anti-drowning campaigns, drownings go down, then some one says 'Why are we investing in this with such low drownings?' then they stop the campaigns and the drownings slowly creep back up. I suspect next year or so we'll see more aggressive campaigns.   


I'm a lifeguard instructor and significantly better than average swimmer in open water, if I'm paddling the school canoe you better believe I'm wearing a PFD. But seriously, any time I'm kayaking at the cottage or anything I'll have one on. I think most recreational water actives are taken seriously by the majority of Nova Scotians. But nationally there are too many people who underestimate their swimming abilities, and PFDs are looked at as too dorky that we'd benefit from an attitude adjustment. The other problem is teaching old dogs new tricks. Older people are making up the biggest demographic of drowning so what do we do to convince dad and grandpa to use a floation device?

"Where are looking exactly? Life jackets while using seadoos, kayaking, paddle boarding etc are extremely common place and are required by businesses that rent them. Wearing life jackets vary if on a boat of course will depend on the person and their preference. 
Why would you wear a life jacket while swimming? Doesn’t that defeat the purpose??
I’m assuming you are not from NS and I say this because those of us who are born are raised here are usually taught water safety from a very young age and are taught how to swim. Nowhere in the province is more then 60km from the ocean so knowing how to stay safe and respect the water is essential. I don’t always wear a life jacket, but I know when I should and in those cases I will. Like most maritimers, I know when the tide is to strong, how to spot a rip current and how to spot an under toe that could be dangerous. Most maritimes also know when to avoid the water. So, maybe the reason you see more life jackets in other provinces is because the people in those provinces have not lived their whole lives next to ocean and they lack the knowledge and understanding that comes second nature to those that have.",t2_dw7i0el4,NecessaryAttitude987,0,1648646845.0,0,t1_i2pniif,i2pniif,True,visijared,t3_ts4k9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaScotia/comments/ts4k9g/why_do_people_in_ns_not_wear_life_jackets/,Why do people in NS not wear life jackets?,/r/NovaScotia/comments/ts4k9g/why_do_people_in_ns_not_wear_life_jackets/i2pniif/,9,r/NovaScotia,0,9

">So check your misinformation - and your bigoted opinions on immigrants.

2 things 

1: Work in the field. The CTA's will be getting that pay soon enough and they deserve it. But the province also refuses to increase compensation anywhere else. 

2. NSHA and the province are deliberately not increasing wages and using new immigrants to reduce wage pressure. New immigrants will not complain about the cost of living going up or the working conditions or the lack of resources as most of them need to work these jobs for a chance at PR or even citizenship. Indian workers and Philippines workers. 

There are sufficient local applicants but NSHA is prioritizing new immigrants in hiring. Locals cannot survive on the wage and are leaving. The province then increases the number of immigrants to offset the loss of locals.

"What an excellent idea to look at it in terms of (ballpark) cost per useable kWh of energy. Efficiency NS [publishes the following](https://www.efficiencyns.ca/tools-resources/guide/heating-comparisons/) numbers for January 1, 2022:

>Energy Rates (In effect January 1, 2022)  
>  
>Oil: 	$1.12/Litre  
>  
>Electricity: $0.1622/kWh

So if one liter of oil represents 10.35 kWh (per google) then the base price per kWH for oil is $1.12 / 10.35 = $0.1082.

My oil boiler is from 2005 so I'll go with an estimated efficiency of 75%.  To compensate for the extra energy required we'll multiply by 1/ 0.75 (this is where my calculations are slightly different). In other words, we'll need 33.33% more energy. The price per kWh of useable heat for oil thus becomes $0.1082 \* 1.33 = $0.143906.

Efficiency for electrical furnaces can be 100%. So what we pay per kWh is what we get for useable heat. As per January 1, 2022 in NS $0.1622/kWh (day rates).

Electrical being more expensive, but not hugely so. With the geopolitical instability it would probably yield another picture with the rates of February, March for oil.

Once we consider the potential for time of day rates however (with the ETS system), we can easily establish that \*if\* we can always charge the system at night, we potentially have a rate of $0.09288/ kWh per kWh of useable energy (reduced rate).

Which gives us a potential (theoretical) savings rate of about (1 - ( 0.09288/ 0.143906) or about 35.50%.

"Once, after church, we were sitting around having tea and cookies and one of the ladies mentioned that the plumber was coming by to fix her leaky sink.  Another lady said that she had called the plumber weeks earlier.  


I thought those two ladies were going to have it out, right then and there in the church, not 30 minutes after the service.  I mean, they were literally yelling at each other.  


I thought (briefly) about mentioning that I can fix a leaky faucet and offered to help, and then sanity prevailed and I decided not to inject myself into an argument between the two church ladies.  I don't trust in the Lord ALL that much!  


Anyway, the same story.  Guys who know a trade can make a living pretty much anywhere.  In the more remote areas, plumbing might be kind of slim if only because in the remote places, virtually everyone perforce has some decent skills, and a lot of people know their way around PEX, basic carpentry and circuits.  


Nova Scotia is beautiful but it's not for everyone.  Regardless of occupation or trade, I wouldn't recommend moving there simply based on the financial issues you describe.  If money is all this is about, you can certainly make more in other places.

"I can’t give a comparison but I can offer some insight as a born and raised Bluenoser:
- NS income tax does a fun thing called bracket creep, which basically means they don’t adjust income tax brackets for inflation so if you make more, but can afford less, you’re still paying more income tax and losing
- healthcare is a mess; no family doctors, ambulance shortage, long outpatient waits (think 8+ hours with a suspected burst appendix) if you’re even lucky enough to have a local hospital/ one without frequent closures
- food costs are high
- in Halifax particularly housing is around 1% vacancy and rental prices are high
- beautiful beaches, camping, etc but not worth it if you’ll have a lower quality of life by moving here

"What exactly do you mean by beaches? Just to walk along and explore? Because it’s still frigidly cold here in Nova Scotia and will be for the next several weeks. Beach season to go tan, drink and swim doesn’t typically begin until July. 

Being a Cape Breton native and resident, I would highly recommend our island. You mentioned hiking and/or cycling. There is a trail called the Ceilidh Coastal Trail which begins at the Canso Causeway (my neck of the woods) and runs for 100 km along the south and west coast of Cape Breton along an old rail bed to Inverness. The views are stunning, you will likely see some wildlife of some sort and it is an incredibly easy hike/bike ride (old rail bed, really flat). It’s a shame you weren’t a week later as it’s a favourite May activity of mine to sit on a park bench on the cliffs in Creignish and watch the lobster fisherman set their traps. From Inverness you are only an hours drive to Cheticamp and the start of the Cabot Trail, where there are countless spots to camp and hike (cycling is ambitious). For a short hike, check out the gypsum mine in Cheticamp, and for a medium sized hike the Skyline Trail about 10 mins north of Cheticamp. 

One thing I will warn you is that outside of Halifax area, most of Nova Scotia is hibernating as it’s winter and not tourist season. Shops, restaurants, campgrounds, cottages, etc that you see online MAY not be open. The rule of thumb for seasonal business in my area anyways is the long weekend in May 21-22.

"This is a nice setup. Far superior to the ""suitcase"" boilers I have seen in the past.

If you want to do a very crude cost comparison with oil vs electric, 1 litre of heating oil is about 10.35 kWh of energy, reduce by your current oil boiler efficiency and you should have a good idea comparison number.

So, 85% efficient boiler, off peak is $0.09228…

"Thanks - those are some very excellent points to consider.

I know that usually fully electric systems are considered to be very power hungry (and thus very expensive to operate). We do have a 200 amp panel already so I'm assuming the 60 or so amps it requires can still be found. I had hoped with the units as expensive as they are (e.g., [https://www.steffes.com/ets/comfort-plus-hydronic-furnace/](https://www.steffes.com/ets/comfort-plus-hydronic-furnace/)) we would still run a net savings compared to oil. This would be with thermal storage and time of day service. Of course nobody can predict future energy prices, but it seems likely oil will over time go up more than electric.

We already added one mini-split in our main space in early February which definitely takes some load off the oil furnace and will help with cooling in summer as well. But for our other spaces (mostly because of configuration) it's not as good a fit. We also have one zone with just radiant in floor heating. So we'll need a hydronic system always unless we eat a lot of costs redoing those rooms. And it would be a shame too as we really like the warmth of the hot water baseboards (heat pumps have a tendency to dry out the air I find).

Thanks for bringing up geothermal. It has been many many years since I last considered it (completely different house, completely different region) but I'll definitely evaluate it again. I had assumed with all of the bedrock especially a vertical loop would be difficult given Nova Scotia's geography but perhaps with the technology advancing it's not as big a deal as it used to be.",t2_113ryu,spcrngr,0,1648593987.0,0,t1_i2mpu1j,i2mpu1j,False,spcrngr,t3_tr06qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaScotia/comments/tr06qs/converting_oil_fired_hydronic_heating_system_to/,Converting oil fired hydronic heating system to electric hydronic + thermal storage (ETS),/r/NovaScotia/comments/tr06qs/converting_oil_fired_hydronic_heating_system_to/i2mpu1j/,2,r/NovaScotia,0,2

"If I put myself in the position of the officers, I'd have fired the shots too.  They were looking for a mass killer in a high-vis vest with a police cruiser and they pulled up on a guy in a high-vis vest standing beside a police cruiser.

I think it might have been, but working radios, geolocation of members, and better incident management might have negated the need to even make a decision.  I think that might be the most important takeaway from the whole thing.",t2_hfo63,DrunkenGolfer,0,1648587701.0,0,t1_i2m6asm,i2m6asm,False,Portalrules123,t3_tqgc5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovaScotia/comments/tqgc5s/rcmp_officers_tell_ns_mass_shooting_inquiry_they/,RCMP officers tell N.S. mass shooting inquiry they 'tried their best' amid mayhem,/r/NovaScotia/comments/tqgc5s/rcmp_officers_tell_ns_mass_shooting_inquiry_they/i2m6asm/,1,r/NovaScotia,0,1
