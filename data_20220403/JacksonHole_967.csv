I was wondering if jackson had any special regional foods we have to try? As in, here in south florida has its fresh oj and cuban food, new Orleans has gumbo and sazeracs, etc.

Second question, does wyoming have wild berries that grow in the woods? I used to live in the PNW and dearly miss eating blackberries on my hikes. Alternatively, are there any pick your own berry/produce farms in the Teton County area?

"From a recent JHNG story last summer:

“Illegal camping has especially sprung up farther south, in places like Fall Creek and Mosquito Creek roads. While making the rounds, Williams-Gomez has heard “heartbreaking” stories that have channeled her frustrations away from some individuals and toward some Jackson Hole businesses. Those businesses gave their staffers unrealistic expectations for housing when trying to lure them to Jackson Hole, and then pushed them toward the national forest when they couldn’t find anything.

“We can’t just use the national forest as the bedroom for employers to house their staff,” Merigliano said. “That’s not what the national forest is about.”

In the most deliberate of instances, staff tied to one luxury Teton Village hotel really tried to make their home on the forest. They outfitted a Fall Creek Road-area site with couches in anticipation of settling in for the summer, but were hit with a host of citations after a Red Top Meadows resident tipped off the national forest.

“Litter, food storage, fire violations,” Merigliano said.

The environmental consequence of forest residency comes in the form of human feces littering the landscape, vegetation and grasses that are worn away and burnable wood that being depleted when campfires are allowed (there’s currently a ban). But there are consequences for Jackson Hole’s human inhabitants, too. There are few places for locals left to camp when all the spots have been claimed by the record-smashing crush of tourists and people who camp to live.

“Our natural resources are suffering, but it’s also locals who want to go up Curtis Canyon with their family and run around without seeing toilet paper,” Williams-Gomez said.”

The irony of all these rich folks leaving the cities complaining about homeless people and shit everywhere, only to try to go camping and find our national forests filled with homeless people and shit everywhere. I’d move somewhere else for the summer if I were you.

"The park was established in 1929 as a national monument that only included the peaks and glacial lakes at their base. Rockefeller began buying up land across to the eastern end of the valley under the guise of the Snake River Land Co. and in 1950 the park as we know it today was established, including all of the land that he’d purchased and turned over. The private lands that remain today within the current park boundary are those who didn’t sell out to Rockefeller.

Really fascinating stuff… the park was continuing - sometimes forcefully - to dissuade development on private inholdings even into the 70s and early 80s.

Getting a 2 stroke mountain sled, and going to actually play around, learn to ride one, and get tossed off a number of times, is very fun. You can get a guide with the sled rental from togowotee mountain lodge, and they will help dig the sled out and make sure you dont kill yourself in an avalanche or lawn dart a creek at 30 mph. Granted, conditions dependent for the mountain sled, you absolutely dont want to ride those in the conditions we've had all February.",t2_4iu9qn8p,H0LD_FAST,0,1646949890.0,0,t1_i05vurr,i05vurr,False,DerpWY,t3_t980n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/JacksonHole/comments/t980n1/howdy_stranger_are_you_visiting_jackson_hole_soon/,Howdy Stranger: are you visiting Jackson Hole soon?

"woof. lot to unpack with your questions but ill actually help here. The village is teton village, where the resort is at (and a bunch of hotels and expensive houses), and where the ranch lot is at. The shuttle stops at 6pm or so, but thats probably not the one you care about because its a 5 min walk from the ranch lot to the ""ski area"". You're not stranded anywhere when the ranch lot shuttle stops.

You probably are thinking of the stilson lot? which is basically half way between the village (i.e. the ski resort) and town, where people park, instead of parking at the resort? Not that stilson lot does much good for you because its just a parking lot.

  
UNLESS youre thinking of the HOME ranch lot in downtown jackson...  
[https://www.jacksonwy.gov/203/Welcome-Center](https://www.jacksonwy.gov/203/Welcome-Center)  
(if this is what youre thinking of, see below comment on the start bus)

You say you want to have dinner in the village and you dont want to get stranded...so im assuming you are staying somewhere in the town of jackson? If you are not staying somewhere in town, how close are you to a bus stop? Either way...if you are staying in teton village...and you want to have dinner in teton village...no shuttle needed, youre already there, just walk. If you are staying anywhere NOT in teton village, look at the start bus map and schedule and figure out where the closest bus stop is to your location and then...dont miss the last one. Uber is usually an option, though thats an not a cheap ride

"Hello. Thank you for your response to my question about parking. You mention Togwatee Mountain Lodge parking. My search on Google Maps located it 59 miles from Teton Village. I'm thinking you might have another location in mind. 

We have been looking closely at the parking information on the Jackson Hole website, [https://www.jacksonhole.com/by-car](https://www.jacksonhole.com/by-car). I do see the following, ""A limited number of season parking passes are sold on a first-come, first-serve basis each season. Passes for the 2021-2022 season have sold out."", so I am wondering if that is what you mean when you say that the Ranch and Stilton lots are already booked through the year. Lower on the website's same page is the following statement, ""\*ALL parking in Teton Village parking lots is on a first-come, first-serve basis and no one is guaranteed parking.""  

I appreciate your suggestion to call the official help lines at the resort. My first call about ten days ago only allowed me to leave a message. I received a call two days later that answered my question. 

Later, to answer my parking question, I called the ""Commercial Improvement & Service District - TVA  
Contact For:  
Public Transportation  
Common Areas Maintenance  
Commercial Parking Lots & Paid Parking  
Visitor Information  
Phone: 307.733.5898""

I was only able to leave a message, and after two days without a call back, I thought I would try the JacksonHole subreddit.

"Not TT’s but I have a pretty good one. 

Par cook noodles according to package instructions 

The sauce is 1 Tbsp tamarind paste, 3 Tbsp fish sauce, 1/4 cup palm sugar and sriracha to taste. Bring to simmer and set aside. 

In a very hot wok Cook your protein half way through, add 1 Tbsp sauce.  Add noodles and toss.  Add enough sauce to coat all of your noodles and toss. Add garlic, bean sprouts, green onions on top of noodles, push everything to one side of wok. Crack an egg or two onto wok and scramble then toss into noddles and keep cooking/tossing until egg is cooked through. Serve with lime wedge extra fish sauce and extra sriracha. 

Adjust your future sauces accordingly:  if you want it saltier add more fish sauce, tangier add more tamarind paste, sweeter add more sugar.

You’ll learn the ratios that you prefer as you make it more and more.

"This isn’t probably advice you’ll want to take, but I’m pretty sure most airlines are allowing you to rebook all flights, even non-refundable tickets. They won’t refund you outright, but they will let you use the ticket as a credit for a different flight. They all started doing this when Covid happened. Not sure about AirBnB, but surely there’s enough notice to get at least a majority refund there too, I would think?

"The 'Best of' nonsense was adopted 10-15 years ago by Mary Grossman of Planet Jackson Hole for the specific purpose of driving ad sales. It was a business model that a lot of 'alternative' newspapers had adopted for the exploitation of their own communities. The idea is that you sell ads to businesses who want to lobby for votes before the contest, and then you sell self-congratulatory, gloating ads to the winners afterwards. It's really for nobody's benefit except the paper's, but it totally works because people are shameless. And you're totally allowed to stuff the ballot box (last I checked) because the editors know that the ballot box stuffers are also the ones who buy ads. At least high school popularity contests have some integrity. 

What does 'best' mean anyway? So dumb. But people do care, and they're competitive and petty. So the contest just pits small business owners and service-providers against each other. Which sucks in a small town.

"Stupid tourist here as well - just visited JHMR last weekend. Snow was solid ice almost everywhere in the morning. With full sun and mild temps (5 below freezing), the groomers started to soften up by 11 or so and off piste stayed hard as a rock. 

Assuming conditions stay the same, plan for spring riding. Take your time getting on hill in the morning, to let the snow soften up.

My best runs were mid mountain groomers off of the gondolas to looker's right. It is a big steep mountain and you can have a lot of fun just bombing.  Don't bother with the tram at least until afternoon - Rendezvous Bowl is a big steep skating rink. 

If you have the option bring a board that can handle ice. I rented a Rossignol XV one day and the magnetraction gave me noticeably more control.

Parking at Jackson Hole was pretty manageable. We parked in the Ranch lot and took the 3 minute shuttle bus to the base.

"It's been a low snow season, but Spring riding can still be very fun regardless. Might be stuck to groomers, but if you're mostly used to midwest hills, then the steeper stuff here will be fun. Start your day lookers right to run accordingly: start with AV, then move towards Teton, Casper, Bridger Gondy, Thunder, etc and hit the tram for a full top to bottom. Get a waffle. Try out the hobacks if you want a workout! Some of our double blues will probably be similar to what you think are double blacks...

Grand Targhee parking is not a problem if you arrive early.

Snow King at evening might not be great if there's freeze-thaw cycle going on, after JHMR and GT it will really pale in comparison. Snow King technically has the steepest slope but I don't think the new gondy runs at evenings anyway.

"START Bus map and schedule:

https://www.jacksonwy.gov/587/START-Bus

5min walk to the north end of Miller Park and $3 (one-way) out to the village, 30min bus ride. Definitely the preferred method, especially if you carry your ski boots and get a locker for street shoes and backpacks out at the village. Even if you had a car, you'd be looking at something like a 20min drive to the Ranch Lot, $20 parking (or free with 3+), and a short shuttle to where the START bus would have dropped you off. 

For dinner, a 5-10min walk would get you all the downtown dining options.

There are, however, a few downsides.

* There is no public transportation from the airport into town (10mi). Some hotels have a shuttle (unsure about mountain modern). Uber/Lyft/Taxi are surprisingly expensive. 

* The nearest grocery/liquor stores are a couple miles away. There is an in town START shuttle bus that is free and runs frequently. Totally doable for a grocery run or two, just a little bit of hassle. There's also a gas station across the street from your hotel. 

* If you want to spend a day going up to GTNP, you would need a car.",t2_r95v5,mdibah,0,1644959374.0,0,t1_hx33yjf,hx33yjf,True,primal001,t3_stcms2,https://www.reddit.com/r/JacksonHole/comments/stcms2/should_we_rent_a_car/,Should we rent a car?,/r/JacksonHole/comments/stcms2/should_we_rent_a_car/hx33yjf/,12,r/JacksonHole,0,12

"Solo Snowboarder in March

Greetings, all.

Potential stupid tourist here (sorry) but I'll be flying into town mid-March for 4 days of riding...and...wait for it...free of wife and little kids.

I've been riding for over 20 years but never in Wyoming. While I have been stuck in the midwest primarily I do get out to Colorado and Southern California occasionally. 

I've got a 2-day pass for Jackson Hole, 1 day at Grand Targhee, and perhaps an evening at Sun King the day I arrive if the conditions warrant it.

I'm curious if there are any specific tips for any of those spots that aren't otherwise easily searchable (like I've read parking at Grand Targhee can be a nightmare but this Dad of 2 little ones will be on the road early in the morning). 

I'm all ears for any suggestions including recommended runs (understanding not all double blacks are created equally) or good beer/music spots around town. Conversely...what not to do as well. This is a makeup trip for my week at Copper/Keystone/Breck that was shut down the week they closed in 2020. I'm just looking for some fun runs, fun crowds, and an omission of serious injury.

"This is incorrect on both counts. Tofu has much less environmental impact than beef. Even if the former is raised across the world and the latter is raised on grass in your backyard due to methane production, and obviously worse if the cows eat soy instead of grass. 

Tofu is also much healthier than beef, a book to check out around the science there is How Not to Die by Greger. One example is meat consumption causes heart disease which is the top cause of death, and has only been seen reversed on a plant based diet.

"It’s probably worth it once. Tram line can be really variable depending on the day, time, and snow conditions. On a holiday or weekend morning it’s going to be packed… 3x if it’s a pow day.

"First timer to the resort, or skiing in general. If the later… good luck. If the former… take Bridger Gondola up, then work the terrain off Thunder and Sublet lifts. Hobacks and all the other off piste terrain on the lower half of that side of the resort are excellent, but can be absolutely brutal if the snow conditions aren’t there. I don’t know your skill level, but take it easy at first until you figure out the rating system as everything is basically a step up from most other resorts. Black runs will be spicy. Double blacks might have cliffs. 

Activities… Going into GTNP during the winter is awesome. Get some snowshoes and go for a hike. Or just drive to the end of the road and take in the insane views.

"> I see no reason to make your stay here easier for you.

I'm still confused by what you're saying. Are you saying that because I didn't stay somewhere nicer, that I shouldn't get access to a microwave? Are you saying that you would've given me access to a microwave if I was staying somewhere less nice? Is traveling on a shoestring budget and cramming a bunch of people into a tiny room not acceptable to you? Do you think that nobody should come to Jackson if they can't afford to drop a grand apiece on the trip? Four of us (two of which are full time students in addition to their jobs, and me, who runs a nonprofit at my own cost in addition to my full time job) road tripped up to Jackson and packed into a tiny room and pre-made our meals so that we could afford to visit your home. And instead of you going ""best of luck, I can't help you"" you come in here and actively tell me ""I *could* help you, but I'm choosing not to."" What grown-ass adult acts like that? Didn't your parents teach you to keep your mouth shut unless you have something nice to say? If you're going to disrespect me, at least put it in a form that I can maybe learn from. But I have no idea what you think I did wrong other than having the _AUDACITY_ to ask if some generous soul would let me borrow their microwave in exchange for a delicious free homemade dinner. This has absolutely nothing to do with a fucking microwave at this point. This is just one human being to another.


I don't know what you want from me. For the record, we ate cold ziti, and I'm not in Jackson any more, so I don't have any skin in the game at this point. I'm purely responding to you personally /u/sheainthuman and the dogshit attitude you have shown me. Does it make you feel good? To see someone making a request in good faith and to shit on them? Do you think that I'm your enemy? Do you think that people like me are the reason that Jackson is so fucked up? Because if you do, you need to take an economics course. Jackson being fucked up is so much bigger than ski bums wanting to vacation on a budget. Are you mad that people want to visit? Move somewhere else, then. You live in one of the most beautiful places on earth. Either accept what comes with that and quit acting like an entitled asshole or go somewhere else. Or just spend the rest of your life waking up angry every morning. I don't give a shit.",t2_8ec6k,YourDoucheBoss,0,1643650270.0,0,t1_hv0nmn9,hv0nmn9,False,YourDoucheBoss,t3_sf2xme,https://www.reddit.com/r/JacksonHole/comments/sf2xme/got_a_microwaveoven_we_can_use_well_pay_you_in/,Got a microwave/oven we can use?
