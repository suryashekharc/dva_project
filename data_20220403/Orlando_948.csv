"Proceed with caution. “No one may sell, assign or transfer a vessel titled by the state of Florida without providing the purchaser or transferee with a valid certificate of title.

Anyone can check who owns the vehicle using the VIN (Vehicle Identification Number).

Take a photo of it then look it up [here](https://services.flhsmv.gov/mvcheckweb/).

That person can apply for a duplicate title if they’ve lost the original (see the first link for details). The process is so easy you should be very suspicious of why someone legit hasn’t done it.

"I cannot speak to the health code violations but what killed Garden Fresh Restaurant Corporation (owner of Sweet Tomatoes) was way too much debt, which put it into bankruptcy protection and ultimately Cerebus Capital Management bought the chain and did nothing to improve its bottom line.

Then the pandemic hit, an already struggling chain could not withstand the loses of being closed for a long time and it was adios Sweet Tomatoes and Soup Plantation.

A buddy of mine worked for Garden Fresh and he said that the economics just did not work when things started to open back up and there was just not way to make a buffet concept work. They tried to come up with a way to  re-open but no matter what they thought of it would have been a complete re-imagination of the chain and that was not possible.

"A lot of rental car companies here offer a flat fee per day to cover all toll charges. It seems like a rip-off, and it is, but compared to the price the rental car company will charge you if you go through a toll without paying their flat fee, it can actually be a deal, if you use tolls often.

Neon 80s colors, so it's rough on the eyes, haha. I lived in that time, so it took me back.

Owner is terrific. Service was pretty damn good; they did give my spouse a little shit for not eating a 'proper meal'.  Haha. They sponsor foster programs, and have a few ways to donate if you are interested.

"Also it is highly impractical and a giant waste of money to do both Universal and Disney World in the same day.

Both parks design it so there is not good transit between them. Both want you to spend your entire vacation at that once place.

For both parks the cost for additional days goes down the more you buy. For Disney you'd usually want to plan for 3 or 4 day passes at a minimum. For Universal you'd usually want to plan for at least 2 days. While you can buy tickets that allow you to go between different disney or universal parks in the same day this is not an efficient use of your time and isn't really worth it if you care about riding rides, it is usually very difficult to ride every ride in one day in a single park if you stay the entire time they are open much less spending an hour or more commuting.

Keep in mind the loads for all parks vary substantially by season, peak season is more than twice as busy as off season and will have upwards of 3+ hour waits for very popular rides.

If you go during a school or summer holiday you'll spend most of your day waiting in lines. The best month to go is September. Low times are September - Early November, mid Jan-Feb, or late April - mid May. If you have to work around the school schedule the best option is Spring Break.

"Five Star in Longwood like one person recommended. Sammy is the owner and he is absolutely awesome. If he doesnt have it you can ask him to order it and he will find it. You may have to buy a case but he will find it. 

Another great place is Country Discount Liquor in sorrento on 46 headed towards mt.dora. I can never remember the guys name but he is an indian dude and the owner. If you ask him to find what youre looking for, again, he will find it. Again, you may have to buy a case if its something expensive or just very off that he knows wont sell otherwise.


I have had to wait months for some stuff but they pull through. They both have been able to find me Inverroche Amber, which is an amazing South African gin, which is near impossible to find here in the states (unless you buy online and pay way more than you should)

"Sapporo was mine as well, and I did hear all the dirty details about the landlord and his scheme. His relative’s shop, which replaced it, is indeed garbage and they won’t get a dime from me. It’s a shame; the line for Sapporo used to stretch out to the road; I can’t believe they’d run out such a successful, landmark business but that’s landlords for you. They were the only ramen shop in town for ages, but they stayed number one long after the other shops began to appear.

Anyway! Ironically, Tokyo Ramen, right next door, is pretty damn good and they’re good people, as well. They don’t have Sapporo’s family recipes, of course; but they *have* added several similar bowls to their menu. I still miss the onigiri, though..

The little shop in Lotte Market also does a pretty good job; better than you’d expect from a supermarket midway. There was one other place that I got via Uber Eats; I’ll post another comment when I can recall the name. Jinya is fine, too!

There’s a gimmick shop called Naroodle that needs to be avoided at all costs—the less said, the better. And another anime-themed place called Soupa Saiyan that sorta allows people to have the impression it has ramen or Chinese dishes, but is actually just expensive Vietnamese, with a more limited menu and mediocre food.

A lot of people will recommend Domu, but I’d rather have Naroodle. Never had a good experience there. The food isn’t exactly garbage; to me, it is inauthentic and vacillates between flavorless, and over-seasoned to nuclear levels. Just average, but it’ll feel like swill once you see the price tag, and have to endure the dine-in atmosphere.",t2_84fqpkha,WoollyBulette,0,1648924226.0,0,t1_i34x20e,i34x20e,False,41aErnie,t3_tujykf,https://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/tujykf/are_all_hibachi_places_the_same/,Are all hibachi places the same?,/r/orlando/comments/tujykf/are_all_hibachi_places_the_same/i34x20e/,18,r/orlando,0,18

"They all buy from the same equipment wholesalers, and they all buy the same ingredients from the same vendors. They all have the same menu, and the staff usually rotate between locations and establishments. It’s a lot like Americanized Chinese restaurants; even though they are all independent businesses, they are still basically buying the same, pre-fabricated restaurant package when they start up.

Thankfully, we have such an amazing and diverse Asian community here in Central Florida that you are actually a bit spoiled for options these days; it wasn’t always like this, but there has been a boom over the last 20 years. Several great spots for ramen now, dim sum on weekends, so much sushi… and Korean barbecue, which might be exactly what you’re looking for.

You can actually get some really authentic cuisine around town, now; there are a lot of options and price ranges, and as long as the little, kibitzing show with the food isn’t an intrinsic part of your enjoyment of the meal, you can get a comparable dining experience elsewhere. Like I said, Korean barbecue is pretty similar to the kind of generic hibachi you see at Kobe. Of course, you are going to have a wider range of options, and all those crazy little side dishes that comes standard with Korean meals, but the flavors and the preparation are basically the same. You get to cook your own meat, as well! a great option for beef. If that sounds like a good compromise to you, then I would recommend Korea house in Longwood, or its sister location on Colonial, just down the road from the Semoran intersection, across from Ichiban (sp?).",t2_84fqpkha,WoollyBulette,0,1648913402.0,0,t1_i348j9a,i348j9a,True,41aErnie,t3_tujykf,https://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/tujykf/are_all_hibachi_places_the_same/,Are all hibachi places the same?,/r/orlando/comments/tujykf/are_all_hibachi_places_the_same/i348j9a/,42,r/orlando,1,42

"The laser tag was pretty good for elementary/middle schoolers, though older kids probably would have found the arena too small and open for a good round with big teams.  


When you did laser tag, you were given gear for the team you were on, then went through this mini ""ride"" that was a very small version of the Star Tours concept. Though it lacked the video, the room still shook when your ""space ship"" took off and landed at the arena.  


When you got into the area, you went to your respective team spawn area, where you would initialize your gun/vest and go to recharge if you got hit. I think there was a laser in the middle of the arena that would hit people from either team; I can't remember if you could hit it for points. For some reason, they \*always\* played The Final Countdown when the game was on, to the point that I thought of it as The Laser Tag song until late in middle school.  


When the game was over, you left through the 'spaceship' room without repeating the motion-sim experience into the main area.

"So these signs are actually quite literal. As someone who had to fight this in traffic court I know way more than I ever wanted to about the ""stop here on red"" (R10-6) and ""no turn on red"" (R10-11) signs.

The tl;dr is that stop here on red is basically just a reminder while no turn on red is a separate traffic requirement.

Stop here on red exists primarily as a reminder to remove any confusion that drivers have on where they should stop on red. This makes it especially useful by at railroad grade crossings and intersections where the stop bar is recessed back from the crosswalk or intersection. In order to avoid confusion, stop here on red must contain an arrow and may only be placed at the same point that the stop bar is at. It basically just duplicates the stop bar.

No turn on red may only be used at signal controlled intersections where there is high risk of collision after a traffic study by traffic engineers. The rules favor safety, but basically it can't be arbitrary. The city must show a legitimate risk such as many points of conflict, high pedestrian traffic, high collisions, etc. to justify the sign. If you turn red at a ""No Turn on Red"" intersection you can receive a ticket for failing to yield to a traffic control device.",t2_39aqo,nn123654,0,1648877506.0,0,t1_i32sm80,i32sm80,False,ThrowAway_MyDrugs,t3_ttw7s4,https://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/ttw7s4/traffic_signs_that_confuse_florida_drivers/,Traffic signs that confuse Florida drivers,/r/orlando/comments/ttw7s4/traffic_signs_that_confuse_florida_drivers/i32sm80/,3,r/orlando,0,3

"So why are turn signals a mandated feature on our vehicles if they are “100% useless” like you claim?  Why do they flash instead of just staying solid? We could go further and ask why our cars also have a hazard lights function or why cars have brake lights? Why are reverse lights white and why do they exist? Why do emergency vehicles have flashing lights and sirens? Why have red, yellow, and green traffic light colors instead of just 3 bulbs with the same color?

Maybe I’m just stupid but I think a reasonable conclusion that can be made is that they serve as indicators for a *potential* or occurring action, specifically identity that action, and to draw attention to drivers.

"Being aware of the existence of gayness is not advocacy. Creating an environment that is not inheritantly hostile to everyone is not difficult, but becomes that way when people create a satanic panic and are convincing themselves scary people are putting their kids against them.


And no. The reason why Florida public education is poor is the reasons I pointed out before. The Department of Education heads in this state is funneling money through the company he rewards government bids to- his own. And it's not a new event. This, alongside the erosion of what schools are and aren't allowed to do, and opening them up to constant interference by parents who have no education *IN* education, and implementing policies that continuously cause teachers to leave the state or go into different sectors is what is causing the reduction. The US as a whole moved to using scores as a metric to award funding, and that has caused poor scoring schools to become further underfunded, and on top of that, often ties the residential taxes into it. Richer schools can afford to keep teaching remote memorization, and poorer schools become baby sitting districts.

"I knew since I was the equivalent to American second grade. You might not have known or thought about it, and most don't think about it because being straight is considered the norm, and queer a deviation. I had crushes on other girls and found them far more appealing that boys, and was overtly aware that this was 'not normal'. This wasn't even about sex at that age. 

What is helpful is having talks that are aimed for their age. Just being aware of the existence of a different pairing of parental units can save a lot of heartache and inner turmoil.

At no point for that young of an age does it need to go into sex. This item most people agree on, and this is part of the dialogue that queer people are very upset about, because mostly straight proponents are quick to view queerness through a solely sexual lense and bring up graphic imagery because... I guess their only interaction with us is through their pornhub searches? Love isn't solely sexual, and it is alarming many people jump straight to that.

There is even an appropriate way to discuss making sure that children have the communication skills to report molestation and things of that nature, rather than stay in the dark about it.

"Well, first of all, my comment is meant to discuss the previous actions DeSantis gladly took to strengthen Disney's stronghold in the area, but if you're curious from an old Pole why the bill is unpleasant, alongside other legislative measures:

There's a heavy attempt at censorship in order to try and change the environment. There is a slow erosion in the public school system that has been going on since Jeb Bush. It makes a *huge* difference if you are in the group being targeted, because everytime it raises the hostility more and more, and the kids feel it most of all. This is an attempt at making people stay silent. I felt this under the USSR. This is the same thing. These are the same attempts. The attempt at linguistic word games, where the Republican party is targeting words used in academia and attempting to poison the well for the laymen is intentional. 

The attempt at offloading the repercussions to parents who are offended enough to sue is meant to drain public schooling while shielding themselves from any fallout. This ties into what the party here has been trying to do for a while.

"He works with the highest donators, not all theme parks, and Disney has received immunity from many bills with ammendments that he approved to free them from burdens that other local business still adheres to.

This latest bill is aligned with PR moves that, again, are meant to grant him free press at a national level. It is not a secret that he is aiming to throw his hat in for the Presidential run. Most of what his appointees and groups have been doing is assigning their own businesses the bids for government run programs and draining the coffers. Programs that are actually beneficial see plenty of bipartisan support. *However*, there is far more of the former being pushed through, especially this last legislative session.

What DeSantis was trying to do right now is purely superficial bluster at Disney. He worked against Democrats to put forward what he is now threatening to take away from Disney. He is likely relying on this incident to be forgotten in the weekly news cycle, and will go back to happily taking Disney money when he does the next PR stunt meant primarily to create a national outcry.",t2_hvgonwqd,Ok-Adagio-3418,0,1648858785.0,0,t1_i31v99a,i31v99a,False,megadave1988,t3_tu05x6,https://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/tu05x6/ron_desantis_bows_down_to_corporate_overlord/,[Ron Desantis] bows down to corporate overlord [Disney],/r/orlando/comments/tu05x6/ron_desantis_bows_down_to_corporate_overlord/i31v99a/,1,r/orlando,0,1

"He barely won against Gillum. 33k votes or about  0.4% points. Over the past 2 years there have been 73k reported covid deaths, the vast majority of which were Republicans (see age, race, antivax status, location etc you can tell by statistics). Rick Scott won his elections at roughly 1.25 points or 64k ish votes. Crist won his election by 7 points against Jim Davis (who was a shit candidate for a Democrat) in 2006. The last governor to win by double digit points was Jeb Bush in '02 and he was the first and only two term republican governor in FL history. Florida is already swinging back towards being a purple battleground state it once was. There is a very real possibility that DeSantis' covid fuckery killed off a big enough voting block to push the governorship straight into Democrat's hands. Now he's trying to pick a fight with the Mouse? Who has an entire fucking month of ""gay days"" over the summer and sells rainbow patterns on EVERYTHING? The company who now owns like half of all the big entertainment stuff being released and is the biggest draw of tourism to the state? The state who primary economic support is tourism? Disney parks have openly supported inclusion to the point that as employee you can wear whatever gender styled company issued uniform you want. Disney knows where the money is and the only reason they backed any potential candidates is because they played ball, not for any particular support of an ideology.
