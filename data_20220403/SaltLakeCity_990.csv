"In the downtown area, unless off street parking is behind a locked gate, it’s really no better than on street parking in terms of theft prevention anyways. Sometimes even worse, because it gives thieves a secluded spot away from traffic to break into your car.

"So it’s interesting… hard to say if the current high prices of used cars will start going down in the near future. So far, I’m not seeing any signs of that - if anything, the situation is getting worse.

There’s also the issue of how long EVs will last vs. ICE cars. Certain parts of any car are basically identical and subject to wear and tear, the elements, etc. but the drivetrain is fundamentally different and there’s no reason that those components won’t last for many decades.

The battery is a different story but the price per kilowatt is rapidly dropping. So by the time my Tesla’s battery needs to be replaced, the available options might be a lot better (and cheaper).

My point is this - I’ve had my Tesla since September, and I could now sell it for $6,000 more that I paid for it. Which basically means that I’ve *profited* quite a bit for each month that I’ve had this car, to the tune of $900/month or so.

So I think it’s better to look at TCO of the vehicle over the time you intend to keep it - and we may be entering a strange new world where a car is more of an investment than an expense (like a house).

So then the core issue really becomes how much you can qualify for in terms of financing, and what the interest rate is (or alternatively, how much capital you want to invest in the asset and the opportunity costs associated with doing so).",t2_e8lj2ssd,racedownhill,0,1649013352.0,0,t1_i39azim,i39azim,False,racedownhill,t3_tvf6s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tvf6s6/a_bunch_of_rivians_on_the_way_down_parleys_canyon/,A bunch of Rivians on the way down Parleys Canyon,/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tvf6s6/a_bunch_of_rivians_on_the_way_down_parleys_canyon/i39azim/,1,r/SaltLakeCity,0,1

"My personal thoughts - I don’t think the Rivian is the best choice for those that need a utilitarian “work truck” or “towing truck”. Maybe it *could* be a decent work truck if you’re not driving more than 100-200 miles a day.

I think the true market for this vehicle is the weekend warrior outdoor athletes who live in cities like Salt Lake or Denver and want to access semi-remote areas for climbing, mountain biking, etc.

For instance - this is an option that’s offered - https://rivian.com/gear-shop/p/rivian-camp-kitchen-x-snow-peak - an integrated camping cook station that folds out of the vehicle. Definitely cool from my perspective, but not all that useful for someone who works in construction or is towing a camping trailer or boat or something.

"zeroscaping is the worst. Might as well just pave everything.

The goal should be a large variety of native plants, trees, etc. Hell, have a couple of fruit trees or a garden. The problem is monolithic beaches of grass all over the place. Is grass the problem? Not really but the vast amount is the problem. You want biodiversity and you want vegetation. Last thing you want is just a mass amount of rocks. Drip lines to help support some of those plants during the most brutal parts of the year uses so much less water than lawns it might as well be no water.

Read up on urban heat islands and you'll see one of the major reasons zeroscaping is the worst. Plus, it provides zero biodiversity which is awful for insects, birds, mammals, reptiles, all the things.

Remember, trees are carbon sinks and having a tree on, say, the south side of your property can drastically lower the amount of water required for your grass due to being in the shade. In my experience I can cut water by 70%+ if the grass is in the shade for the large portion of the day.",t2_74iw7nz6,PaleontologistLanky,0,1649009775.0,0,t1_i392een,i392een,False,HomelessRodeo,t3_tv95f1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tv95f1/dnr_no_utahns_should_be_watering_lawns_this_week/,"DNR: No Utahns should be watering lawns this week, except Washington County",/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tv95f1/dnr_no_utahns_should_be_watering_lawns_this_week/i392een/,4,r/SaltLakeCity,0,4

Salt Lake City is in the middle of no where, expectations should fit that reality. We lack diversity, style and a few other categories. 

However, there are some dishes that SLC shines. Beef items for one, are pretty high quality since they're locally sourced. Finding similar quality in a costal city is difficult or impossible for the same price point. 

Which brings up the next item, food is inexpensive comparatively. Upper quality dishes here can be a fraction of what it would cost in a costal city.

I would recommend just trying different little independent places, though – there's a lot of places that aren't anything fancy to look at and maybe don't pop up on the typical ""best of"" type lists, but have great food from different areas.

"It was my first and only to date. I was reluctant to go but my roommate(and friend) at the time gave me the cruise since his boyfriend had broken up with him (long story) and I just had to pay for the airfare etc. I'm to this day a terrible flier and had an awful flight from Las Vegas (where I lived then) then to Chicago for a 2 hour layover then to Panama where the ship was. It took most of a day. But the weather was great, as was the food. Except since I lived in Las Vegas I was used to lots of places with lots of food to eat. Each port had tours we got to take and I remember in one of them we went on a tourist train through a cave which was terrific and kind of scary. Then on the way home, our flight was delayed and we spent another 3 hours in O'Hare airport.

She was already denied welfare for making too much money and they didn’t have her go to the church first and “allow them to administer welfare” as your comment says. The individual who recommended she get help from the LDS church specifically was out of line. I understand recommending she go to a nonprofit but they should not have named the LDS church specifically. Most people who apply for welfare benefits apply online and speak to someone on the phone briefly for intake. I have never had anyone ask me anything about getting help from a church and when I was denied food stamps for making too much money, no recommendation at all was made to me. I get that the church gives money to a lot of LDS people and that saves the state, and ultimately tax payers a lot of money but like I said, governments everywhere “allow welfare to be administered” in this way. Churches can give their money to who they want and if we don’t like it, Ipersonally don’t, We don’t support that church by shopping at the DI and the like.",t2_o06dw,janeusmaximus,0,1648953217.0,0,t1_i36d3h9,i36d3h9,False,[deleted],t3_tusdj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tusdj0/the_di_is_too_expensive/,The DI is too expensive,/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tusdj0/the_di_is_too_expensive/i36d3h9/,1,r/SaltLakeCity,0,1

"I get you. You can see from your little window on the world the inherent problem with many things in society. 

All of these problems can be opportunities to grow and develop. 

Perhaps if I could humbly submit a recommendation on the cultural change is to reject voting as a primary means of resistance to what you are really complaining about, the class war being waged against you by the rich and powerful, which include large religious/theocratic organizations. Whose token efforts at appearing charitable are only validating the systems of oppression against you.

The types of friendships that you create, the work you must do to create your own tribe of people, by first developing yourself into a great friend and potential ally of others, is the way to be pro social. 

Those kind of authentic trusted connections are not going to be found in a top down hierarchy of either a political party or religion IMO. So by taking care of ourselves first, we can learn to care and take care of others. The challenge is work on ourselves in a way that does not come at the expense of others so we don't fall victim into the same traps of others.",t2_du6paenk,WhyamImetoday,0,1648949461.0,0,t1_i365lux,i365lux,True,[deleted],t3_tusdj0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tusdj0/the_di_is_too_expensive/,The DI is too expensive,/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tusdj0/the_di_is_too_expensive/i365lux/,4,r/SaltLakeCity,0,4

"I grew up in Ohio and moved here a little under 2 years ago, so feel like I’m qualified to respond lol.  Long story short it’s a great place to live with some caveats.  The housing is definitely much less expensive than here, although it’s rising in the main cities like Columbus/Cincinnati/Cleveland.  Lot of good nightlife and restaurants in the aforementioned cities.  Plenty of nice suburbs as well if you don’t want to live downtown.  

The weather is stereotypically pretty unpredictable in Ohio, but generally summers are relatively hot and humid and there’s more snow in winter than here depending on where you are in the state.  Fall/spring is really nice and the whole state is much more green and lush than Utah.  

Liquor laws if you drink are more relaxed, the popular chain grocery store I used to frequent (Meijer) had open isles of liquor in the store that you could self checkout with, even on Sundays.  

As far as people are concerned they are typically friendly/welcoming, Midwest nice is a real thing.  Lot of diversity in the larger towns as well.

The primary negative in my mind about Ohio (and the reason I moved to SLC) is the lack of outdoor activities.  Sure there are some nice state parks but everything more or less looks the same, there isn’t a ton of public land, and the highest area in the state is like 1500 feet lol.  That being said you can drive to the Appalachian Mountains for a weekend trip, not very large peaks but it’s still scenic.

" I agree with most of what you have to say. At one point,  I was a single mom with 3 kids and lost my travel industry job after 911. I got church help exactly twice and they hounded me relentlessly to not only attend sacrament,  but to take on a church job. 

At that point I had picked up an (almost) minimum wage job. They didn't particularly care that between job and kids,  I  was running ragged. By God, I should be working in the young women's program and that was that.

Except soon after moving in we discovered a roach infestation and also a feral cat situation behind our shed. Plus landlords who are reluctant to fix anything (bathtub that needs refinishing, hvac system that is incredibly inefficient, non insulated attic).

"I think you're putting the cart before the horse here:

Models are human-created methods of understanding natural phenomena.  Models are not all-inclusive of **every** phenomenon(nor are they very accurate), but rather are an imperfect tool that helps our simple simian brains to understand phenomena and enable us to predict more.  However, Its important to understand that models are *mere representations* of reality.  Reality does not exist within a model's rules, models (good ones) are updated to reflect observed reality.

Consider the ""Standard Model"" of physics:  Yes, it has good explanations why physical and celestial bodies behave the way they do, but it is far from perfect.  Both ""dark matter"" (matter that appears to exist but does NOT fit the model) and ""dark energy"" (energy gain that appears to exist but does NOT fit the model) are required to keep the model from falling apart and no longer natural phenomena.  This ""darkness"" doesn't refer to the luminosity or lack of energy, but rather the fact that ""scientists don't know why, but the model is still pretty good, so let's not throw it out"".

Models are restricted by human's understanding.  Natural phenomenon are not.  As such, the employment of models to evaluate should be limited to what the model is intended for.   If models were perfect, then your point above would make sense, but if that were the case, you'd be omniscient (and probably God).  Models are not.",t2_2a3l9gh1,Gudzenheit,0,1648919526.0,0,t1_i34me24,i34me24,False,PhobosTechnologies,t3_trxlpo,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/trxlpo/seeking_other_slc_locals_to_collaborate_on_an/,Seeking other SLC locals to collaborate on an independent research project,/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/trxlpo/seeking_other_slc_locals_to_collaborate_on_an/i34me24/,1,r/SaltLakeCity,0,1

"SLC is not telling anyone that, the market is telling people that if you want to live 30 mins from ski resorts, mountain access, and have a growing city nearby then you are going to have to pay up for that quality of life. SLC is not helping though with their zoning laws.

Can’t blame the rich people for not giving lower income Americans a place to live. However, you can blame the local zoning laws in your municipality, the people that have lived there were the ones that made it so only rich people would be able to afford their properties and they would have nowhere to go once they sold because it’s nothing but million dollar single family homes because that’s all that’s allowed to be built. They weren’t a million dollars before, but Salt Lake County has been built out and as real estate agents say “location, location, location”. People who have the means will pay more money to live where they want, especially now that people can live anywhere with work from home. Just like Cali they pay up for the weather, here they pay up for access to mountains. Now that SLC County is built out, but there isn’t any upzoning occurring, people have to move further and further away to afford something because the demand to be close to the only place to do anything (SLC) and ski resorts is through the roof and there’s no intention by any city to upzone because the zoning is controlled by the locals, which as you have seen on Reddit, they don’t like people coming in from the outside, so they keep things SFH to minimize the people coming into their community, but that in turn makes housing more expensive for everyone, whether you were born here or moved. There’s obviously more that goes into it, but zoning is a main point.

"Hey I was in the same boat! I was taken there with my wife by one of my best friend's parents just last night. It was pretty good! They grew up here and it seems to be one of their regular spots since the 80s for when they want a fancier meal with a nice atmosphere. 

It's a five course English restaurant. It wasn't very busy when we got there (though we also ate at freaking 5:30pm) so by the time we left it was medium busy and I'm sure it got busier later on. Oh yeah and if you're driving by the front of it on Foothill there's like four parking spots but behind the restaurant there is more parking. Maybe that's why it seems so strange there. 

It's probably not the most helpful for the OP being that the chips were just a side with your main course during this 5 course meal. You probably can't just pop in and pick up some English chips you're craving in the moment but still it was my first time having chips quite like that and surprised me to see this post looking for them in Salt Lake so I had to respond.",t2_3y9e92m5,joeshmoe117117,0,1648911777.0,0,t1_i344z1r,i344z1r,False,jbimmer3,t3_tuidmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tuidmx/where_can_i_find_these_frieschips_in_the_valley/,Where can I find these fries/chips in the valley?,/r/SaltLakeCity/comments/tuidmx/where_can_i_find_these_frieschips_in_the_valley/i344z1r/,7,r/SaltLakeCity,0,7
