"That is absolutely not what I'm saying. Where did you get that from? It is well-documented fact that mechanics will charge women more because of an existing stereotype-- that women know nothing about cars and men know a lot. Many women are plenty knowledgeable about cars and some women are mechanics. Also, the average man knows very little about cars. I don't know much about fixing cars, so I have to put my trust in experts and I would prefer to place my trust in someone honest.

"I don't know of a rental bike place in Salinas. Maybe buy a cheap bike or second hand bike and sell/donate it when you are done visiting. Make sure to save a day or two to catch the bus line into Monterey (you can load your bike on a rack if you need). The coastal bike/walk trail is wonderful. Do be cautious of crime and terrible drivers when you ride. A bike lock is 100% needed in most of the town. While the stories are WAY over exaggerated about violent crime, but theft is not terribly uncommon here.  

I think a must is getting some good Mexican food while you are here as others have mentioned, Salinas has good stuff all over.

[https://villaazteca.com/dinner-menu](https://villaazteca.com/dinner-menu) Is the higher end of things including price. Everything I have had there is wonderful but it's more Mexican Fine Dining.  

There are fishermans wharfs in Monterey, Moss Landing, and Santa Cruz for seafood fixes and ocean view dining. Monterey and Santa Cruz are more touristy wharfs, Moss Landing is more a working wharf. 

Carmel-By-The-Sea is a neat little community just south of Monterey and a great day trip. Very tourist driven but some of the best food in the area and only a few blocks from the ocean. (Also the most expensive!) 

Big Sur is another must if you will have car access. The iconic bridge is iconic and plenty of stops along the coast to catch the sunset. 

 Another good day trip is Santa Cruz, CA. The Beach Boardwalk there has a few rides but I think it is only weekends right now.

"The weather is beautiful year round in Salinas and Monterey Bay. The best hiking areas are Toro Park south of Salinas & Fremonts Peak to the east. Fort Ord has amazing bike trails, I’m sure you could hike them as well. It used to be a military base so there is a lot of land and trails with beautiful scenery. South Salinas/ Old Town is the most walkable.
The Mexican food in Salinas is the best around. I recommend El Charrito. Alvarado Street Brewing has great beer. 
Getting to some places is possible by bus, our local service is called MST, here is a link to their service maps:

Walking/biking to some places may be possible but it might require taking farm roads and back roads.

"La Costa is very popular. My wife and I enjoy their carnitas and al pastor in particular when it comes to tacos. 

Their coctel is particularly good too. Deveined shrimp (if that matters to you), tender octopus, well balanced flavor. 

On the weekends we'll often drive down east alisal and stop at different taco trucks after having a couple beers at XL. 

El Jaliscience has a few locations around town and I've enjoyed their carnitas as well.

"Remember when the SHS athletic department got sanctioned in 2006? 

One of the major issues was student athletes using fraudulent addresses to be able to go to Salinas High, because it was a whiter school and got all the funding from the school district and clout from the community. They were basically padding their athletic department with athletes from across the district who should have gone to other schools, among other violations. The athletic department knew, and looked the other way. Student athletic careers were ruined because the adults were willing to lie to win, and because parents openly didn’t want their kids to go to school with BIPOC students in other parts of the city. 

Even though a data analysis of test scores didn’t actually place SHS at the top of the district. From an academic standpoint, it wasn’t the best school in the district at the time. 

This community has spent so much time and money putting Salinas High on a pedestal while degrading other schools in town for being more diverse and located in areas with less money. Instead of appropriately funding other schools, Salinas High got all the money and investment and the adults in charge have encouraged SHS students to mock students from the other parts of town who are less privileged than they. 

This incident is the culmination of *decades* of open and covert racist attitudes and behaviors among the parents of the white population of Salinas, particularly South Salinas, Spreckles, and Toro Park.

Own your shit, SHS.

"So many factors. High rates of poverty and broken homes increase the likelihood for crime. Also, fewer opportunities for advancement. A lack of faith in the community or government as a whole contribute to division. 

A friend of mine in Salinas was killed by a drunk driver from Carmel recently, and the DA dropped the case because the kid's DNA was on the passenger airbag ""proving"" that he wasn't the one driving. Never mind that his vehicle rolled multiple times. I'm highly suspicious that if the backgrounds were switched then the results would be different as well. 

There is a divide, and much of the monterey bay wants that divide to stay. 

On a brighter note, Salinas has been improving a lot over the last decade or so more or less. 

Downtown's undergone a very promising facelift. Crime rates are down. I think Salinas is heading in the right direction overall.

"Does the beerded bean roast their beans? I'm not trying to hate. I just grew up going to the cherrybean and I never understood why it doesn't get more love from people my age. I've grew up going there, and love when the roaster's going. 

I love Star Market too for being small, local, and having good products. They have the best cheeses in town. 

And I'm really excited for Alvarado's new location in downtown. 

Downtown overall looks really good with its new facelift and I'm looking forward to more business offerings coming in. 

Growing up in the 2000's Salinas didn't really have fuck all going on when I was a teenager and the violence seemed to be a lot worse. 

I'm really proud that Salinas seems to have put its worst years behind it, and we're all just trying to do better and have better lives. 

I hate how the rest of the county looks down on us, and I'm glad we're proving our stereotypes wrong.

"Hey, thank you so much for the encouragement. I'm glad you enjoyed my response. I hope the story was comparably as well written. 

You're the second person to mention Darren's daughter potentially being Mari. That was completely unintentional. I only wanted to illustrate that kids from Salinas like the same things as kids from Monterey. I'm sure in a longer version, they would cross paths to further highlight this point or at the very least she would go into Salinas. 

I know that sounds like a pretty obvious statement, but I think in the context of the story it is more well illustrated.

"This is an interesting take. Thank you for taking the time to respond. 

If I was explicitly trying to summarize all of Salinas in a single story I would understand the stereotyping accusation, but my points aren't meant to be as strong as you received them. Nothing in the story excludes white shooting victims or judgmental Hispanics, but I agree that a longer version would allow space for those topics to be touched on. Thank you. 

It's interesting you mention darren being a poorly drawn white person when nothing in the story explicitly states he is in fact white. or for that matter, what race/s his daughter could be. He is in fact based not on pure imagination, but real people I have run across throughout the county. He is not meant to represent the county or white people in their entirety, but those that dismiss Salinas. 

Ironically enough, I've been accused of being ""too white"" and now I'm being accused of not having enough white exposure. Combined, I think this is a good thing. 

Regardless, communication is a two way street and if that's the message you received from the story then so be it, and I appreciate your feedback. My response is not meant as a rebuttal but as an explanation of what was meant vs. what was received. 

It is a beginning. I would like to turn it into something longer that does indeed undo the stereotypes touched on in the story.",t2_v6gyo,NicAdams1989,0,1621855266.0,0,t1_gz9f6a7,gz9f6a7,False,NicAdams1989,t3_njn57c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Salinas/comments/njn57c/i_wrote_a_salinas_based_short_story_and_would/,I wrote a Salinas based short story and would like feedback.,/r/Salinas/comments/njn57c/i_wrote_a_salinas_based_short_story_and_would/gz9f6a7/,2,r/Salinas,0,2
"Some pretty heavy stereotyping going on.  Guys like White Boy Brian get killed standing in their garages too, and there are rich old Hispanics that like to look down on the less advantaged.   A little more nuance would be nice, but that might take a little longer look.  Seems like a decent first draft of an idea but seems like you were way too eager to end it.

I'd recommend writing it a couple more times or even just tell it over and over orally and record it.  More details will fill in.

"The CherryBean has been around for over twenty five years and actually roasts their own coffee unlike other coffee places in town. Buy some beans or get a brew bar of your choice. ACME coffee in Seaside also roasts but they're relatively young having started in 2004. I would recommend sticking to drip coffee at either place however. The only place I've found that has consistently well made espresso/espresso based drinks is Viva Espresso on N. Main. 

Grower's pub is a nostalgic prime rib steakhouse with origins back into the 40's. They make an effort to maintain that old school steakhouse look. Worth visiting. 

Villa Azteca is the first/only upscale-ish Mexican restaurant in Salinas. It's a little bit spendy, but you get your money's worth. They make good Mexican food that isn't offered elsewhere. I mention it because love it or hate it, Salinas is overflowing with Mexican restaurants. If you want tacos, La Costa is popular. If you want burritos for lunch on the go El Charrito is the go to. That being said, there are no Mexican restaurants worth eating at in the Monterey area itself if you're there. 

For wine tasting, McIntyre Vineyards are the oldest vineyard in the Santa Lucia Highlands AVA and have a small tasting room in Carmel-By-The-Sea. Chalone vineyards are the oldest in the county but their tasting room is a bit out of the way. If you want something not old (rebought/labeled in 2016) Folktale Winery in Carmel Valley is hugely popular. The wine is great. The pizzas are good. It's probably the nicest wine tasting venue in the county, and is very instagramable if that's something you might be into, but if you're not, it's still very nice. 

I guess the steinbeck house restaurant is closed, but is open for tours.

""Hartnell college loses money because the LatinX community mostly goes there.""

\>>Hartnell college is literally building when most other colleges are downsizing?  how do you explain that?  Also, a particular community or group going to a particular college doesn't guarantee a particular result.  Correlation does not equal causation. If it did then a great many things would be different for all cultures.

""If the Mexican can make their own business and agriculture industry then more Latinos can have a better life. But instead, all join gangs, get pregnant early, and sell drugs. Y'all get what you deserve""

\>>Again, data.  3/4 of benefits go towards the elderly and disabled. That is not a community its everyone. Its disappointing to lump a group of people because of a stereotype or your limited perception.

"I spend most of my life in school or at home, so it doesn’t really feel different from a summer vacation. Having said that, it’s tough to remember that I’m not done with school and just spend my days cleaning or watching TV.

I’m not learning anything from my online classes, can barely focus on them, and don’t particularly care given the current situation. I won’t be having a university graduation ceremony either (something I’ve worked so hard to have 4 years after high school), so it’s not like that can be dangled over my head as punishment for my poor work or something. 

Of course, all of this is really minor, petty stuff compared to being grateful that my family hasn’t caught it and is generally following the shelter in place and hasn’t stepped out (I have an essential family member, so not completely).

"I’ve honestly only had boba from Honey Berry (close to Food 4 Less on Sanborn) and it’s delicious! It’s normally empty, quick, and with nice employees. It sometimes smells strongly of cleaning products and sometimes looks a little messy (I’ve walked in and seen ripped pillows just piled on the floor for some reason and chairs pulled back from the tables), but overall it’s not too bad because of how empty it usually is. I prefer to deal with a slightly grimy place I’ll be in for 3 minutes tops than a squeaky clean place where it takes 3 minutes to walk in the door. Plus, I’ve never had a problem with placing my order or had a bad experience with a rude employee. They’re super nice and polite! 

As for the menu items, I strongly recommend a blended taro boba (divine!), a passion fruit tea, or a roti bun. I’m blanking on the exact prices, but they’re pretty good and getting a larger size is not too expensive (though you get a good amount for your price, I can never manage to finish a large lmao). Overall, delicious treats at Honey Berry! :) Still, I don’t understand why almost every time I walk in I’m the only customer.

"Alright, I got my license back in August last year and let me just say that it’s easy if you have practiced and use common sense (I’m not trying to sound condescending, it’s just the straight-up truth). I was terrified, but I still passed (even got a “Good job!!” written). Let me share my experience...

After signing in and getting tested for basic controls/car functions (like if I know the hand signals, where the defroster is, if the emergency lights work, etc.), I was told to head out of the parking lot into the nearby streets. Traffic was really bad, so much so that I couldn’t leave for a minute. When I finally got out, my proctor told me where to drive; he would say stuff like “Turn left in 100 feet”, “Change lanes”, “At the lights, turn right”, basic stuff like that. I basically just drove around nearby streets. They’re fairly decent; they’re not too narrow and not full of potholes. It was during the afternoon, so there were kids running around; I spent a lot of time waiting, yielding to jaywalkers, and looking several times to make sure kids were not around.

I was scared, but I passed by being extra careful and making a big show of following the rules. I follow them to the best of my abilities, but since the DMV is close to residential and commercial areas, you need to be extra careful. If possible, try to scope out the area before your test in order to get a sense of it and help feel more at ease. I’ve lived here my whole life and know those streets, so I could focus more on being careful than worrying where I was heading. The DMV people also take care to give you clear instructions with enough time so you can follow their directions. 

Some extra tips:

• Better safe than sorry! I felt foolish waiting so much time to leave the lot, but it would have been dangerous to leave because of how much traffic was passing. Showing you’re cautious is better than looking like a reckless, potentially dangerous driver.

• If you have issues with parking parallel to the curb, try moving your mirrors. I can more easily do so now, but I straight-up moved them to have a good look at the street.

• Make a big show of being safe! Look extra times to cross, do a full stop rather than a “rolling stop”, and don’t immediately turn off your blinker when changing lanes (turn it off after completing a lane change). It’s all good practice, but it helps make you look better.

• Make sure to be nice to your examiner. It goes without saying, but you’d be surprised at how much being nice can help set you both at ease. 

• Every time you drive, drive defensively and as though everyone else is out to get you. I know if can sound a bit paranoid, but you never know how other drivers or pedestrians are. Are they drunk? Are they reckless? You don’t know, so always assume they are dangerous. I’ve seen almost crashes because someone doesn’t know how to do a stop or pedestrians suddenly run out into traffic. It might sound tough, but try to keep your cool and focus; it’s easier to take control or be able to react in a situation like that. 

If you have never been in a behind-the-wheel exam, try to look up a video on YouTube. “CA DMV Driving Test Dash Cam -NERVOUS!-“  helped me get a sense of what to expect (my proctor sounded more soothing though lmao).

"my primary issue with the grade skipping isn't that it doesn't exist. if it universally didn't school-wide I would have been fine with it. I'm even fine with it being at other high schools, understanding how packed SHS is.

my primary issue is the favoritism. shove clubs, etc academics aside; it is absolutely infuriating when my peers are given an unfair advantage I wasn't.

and I do agree that a lot of the issues are district wide but that doesn't mean it doesn't detract from the quality of the school overall. the curriculum is ass either way

can't speak much about the culture - bit of an outsider, which probably colors my responses. but I've avoided touching upon that anyways, esp. including another thing that you and I both know ticks me off quite a bit, but is probably too confidential",t2_40vn26j,x64bit,0,1583215050.0,0,t1_fjccha6,fjccha6,False,Guinno_,t3_fax2hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Salinas/comments/fax2hq/salinas_high_celebrates_its_100_year_anniversary/,Salinas High celebrates its 100 year anniversary of being on Main Street,/r/Salinas/comments/fax2hq/salinas_high_celebrates_its_100_year_anniversary/fjccha6/,1,r/Salinas,0,1
"Majority of what you're talking about is mainly pinned on the district, though i agree that Integrated science is not good you also have to look at the broader view. The school and/or district is not necessarily trying to cater to a specific minority, they are obligated to  serve literally everyone at high school age. Though yes allowing students to take classes above their grade level is an example of catering to ones needs you shouldn't expect it to be like everyday. Not everyone is a big brain big boy, not everyone some machine, just because a small minority of people are lil jimmy neutrons doesn't mean that the school should cater to every one of their needs. 

Though i can very well guarantee that i am not very qualified to talk about this i can only speculate. A 2.0 gpa or higher is the minimum to graduate HS in the US (if i am right), so its not necessarily the schools fault. Blaming almost every problem you have on the school curriculum-wise is essentially just using them as a scapegoat. And Yes of course there can incidents where you do have the authority to blame the school because it is actually their fault. But hell not every place is the perfect Utopia of a public school. Hell, you are in a public school, if you do not like the curriculum, or you truly believe that you're knowledge should be challenged harder then you are more than free to go to a private school with such traits, the only problem with private schools are that you know, you have to play big bucks, even then you still have the ability to kick ass in public school, there is still nothing deterring you to become top of the class.

Also i would like to say even if this whole fiasco with SHS exists you still have another thing, the culture. For as long as i've also been in this school i had a fun time here, yes,  there are ups and downs but everyone goes through them at least once during High school. Being apart of Robotics during freshman year one of the best experiences i ever had in my life. Being in pep band gave me a whole lot of school spirit. And of course ive met very cool people, some of which i would say i love. Though I dont like some of the teachers or staff in SHS i still dont let it ruin my whole experience, I still have a whole other thing going for me as well.

"shs sucks ngl

edit: shs is great in a variety of areas (for instance, ROP and sports - *to a degree*), but the whole reason for the school's existence - education - is crippled by a hilariously low skill ceiling. 

any high achieving students who want an opportunity to skip their classes have to jump through extremely tight hoops. counselors are unreliable with what information they provide, and I personally was never able to take advantage of my mathcounts experience (which taught me high school math early on).

favoritism is rampant. for instance, I know several students who have attempted to skip a math class or science class with the credentials to do so, but were denied the opportunity. others said their counselors accepted the skip with no remarks. if not for this school I would have been in Calc BC during my junior year.

the curriculum is ass. understandably, this isn't entirely SHS's fault (and many math teachers are actually fighting against it!), but what the hell is Math 1, Math 2, and Math 3? Integrated Science? their goal was to provide a broader, more expository education, but what really ends up happening is that we rehash the same gen-ed science curriculum we had in middle school. I'm incredibly grateful that I escaped the NG science fiasco...

there's a variety of other issues with this school reaching outside the curriculum that makes my blood boil even more, but I won't bother going into them. I can only say that I'm confident this school did not provide an enriching experience for me, and probably even held me back from what I could have been. dropping $$$ at York might have been worth it after all...",t2_40vn26j,x64bit,0,1582923195.0,0,t1_fj1mk1z,fj1mk1z,True,Guinno_,t3_fax2hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Salinas/comments/fax2hq/salinas_high_celebrates_its_100_year_anniversary/,Salinas High celebrates its 100 year anniversary of being on Main Street,/r/Salinas/comments/fax2hq/salinas_high_celebrates_its_100_year_anniversary/fj1mk1z/,0,r/Salinas,0,0

Adjusted Vocational training
     
Conversion of existing unused space to voluntary entry supervised transitional housing with a two year limit and a monthly saving requirement third party held which is then used to pay for first and last months rent on a new place.   
     Permanent free supervised housing with required participation in social services contractual obligation enforced for those unemployable after failing the program due to circumstances beyond their control. 
Mental health facility with advocates to help people find social services to aid them in living well with their disorder, therapy, and psychiatry. Harm reduction is paramount. These people are likely to relapse so if they do they should try to reduce the harm and harm reduction should be taught in this community to well reduce harm.     
     Employ members of the community to continuously clean the community such that vagrancy in the area becomes impossible due to the constant beautification projects and the availability of state sponsored work.   
     Attract volunteers for a soup kitchen where a daily meal is provided of various beans, vegetables, starches, and of meat is desired a criminally small portion. This is to ensure the health of the community and to inspire members to pursue employment opportunities where meat is part of the lunch and the prospective employment means the ability to buy food for ones self and thereby expand your food choice. But free food should be excellent for the health and there is nothing better for the human body then majority plant based food and occasional meat. It is also good for the spirit and inspires you to strive for those wonderful feast times. Allowing stable community members the chance to work with the affected community will allow them to empathize and feel pride in being the kindness that exists in the human heart despite dark times. This is a privelege and the first people to do it should be the public servants who ignored this issue to show that they are willing to address it.    
      Construction of free public restrooms maintained by community members. Restrooms should be designed to be able to be cleaned easily and hygenically. A person should not feel demeaned to clean this restroom. Maybe slant it so you can pressure wash it and get them a standing screen plexiglass with a slate for the hose nozzle and then no matter the mess clean up washes down the drain and any person could be glad to serve the community they came from in this manner. Pride is healthy.     
     Construction of free public showers. Pressure washable behind a screen. We keep our community and our community members clean. With dignity because we deserve dignity.      
     An emergency shelter for displaced peoples who are newcomers to the community. Remember where you came from.     
     A rehab.     
     A medical clinic that uses non narcotic approaches, is familiar with addiction treatment, is familiar with health problems associated with long term homelessness, of addiction is identified refers to rehabs, meetings, SMART, AND harm reduction services hopefully center.      
     Drug use is legally a crime but humanly has been practiced by all cultures, which drug, is arbitrary. The important thing is that the community, currently using drugs despite the laws, can limit the harm to public/ individual health.  Decriminalize drug use and instead have police take these people on a tour of the community and redirect them to a safe and supervised injection site and make them aware of the various social services and the life they could make for themselves. Drug use is not permitted in the public eye.     
     Voter registration so that the community sees that their participation in the political process is desired. Solicit politicians to come to China town and speak on how they can expand programs like the above to other municipalities effected by the human health problems which effect vagrant peoples; house less ness, addiction, lack of specific tailored medical care, lack of accommodated employment, lack of adequate mental health care, lack of free healthy food for people who clearly cannot provide it for themselves and whom the current government provides no coverage for yet soup kitchens which exist clearly do, lack of free and permanent housing for the unemployable after seeking out adjusted employment within the community, express desire for community members to become citizens by making permanent voter registration a fixture in the community, and educate community members who desire education.      
    Education for members of the community who want to improve their employment prospects is a focus at the better future center. Education in Chinatown should be focused on how can I make a better life for myself through education?  No airy degrees. Effectuate or bust. Make me more money in six months to two years. Coincidentally the same amount of time as the limit on transitional housing in Chinatown. Extensions readily available and encouraged for people who have a hang nail overlap in their time frames. No more than six months through protocol.     

This is how you fix Chinatown;

Train for jobs/Create jobs whose sole purpose is to better Chinatown and employ the unemployable,

House,

Feed,

Clean,

Shelter,

Rehabilitate,

Treat,

Beautify the community,

In specific indoor medically supervised safe use sites allow drug use to sequester the problem and most importantly provide services to those effected,

Register to vote,

And

Educate the willing.

**But the one comment on that article is really intriguing:**

>I know there has to be tunnels especially along 101 in east Salinas. I hear strange noises at night like chanting and Dogs screaming. Even humans at times. . if you come out here around 3 to 4 in the morning it sounds like the gates of he'll have just opened. Bring a mic , put it on the ground and cover it with a bowl.

Someone who rented an office above a bar that's now First Awakenings said the bartender showed him a door behind/under the bar that led to the basement that was connected to a tunnel that went down main toward the Maya.

Someone believes that the tunnels were carved out to install utilities in the buildings that were built before electricity and plumbing.
