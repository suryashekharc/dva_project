The Bay is not a deepwater port, with average depth of \~25 feet. We dredge the shipping lanes to ensure they are \~50 feet deep.

Politicians look at their base, and they see voters who want to feel superior and more free because they own a car and can transit many miles on the shoulders of giants. And instead of empowering the vast majority, or looking to the future so future generations can prosper, they cater to these voters with short sighted goals and contentment.

"[Here is an article](https://readpassage.com/lesson/the-invention-of-car-culture/) with a lot of sources within that really points out what happened over the past century. I'd really encourage anyone with your mindset to read the section titled ""A century-long street fight"". I have no connection to this journalist or website, except that I googled it 10 minutes ago and made sure the author was actually a journalist.

We live in single family dwellings partly due to [zoning laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoning_in_the_United_States). Those zoning laws also have roots in racial segregation and class segregation. They didn't exist prior to the 1900s. It's also a huge reason we're currently in a housing scarcity. Myself and many others think those zoning laws should be revisited with progressively minded goals steering the decisions.

While Norfolk public transit as it currently stands may be ineffective financially and time consuming for you, many people don't have an alternative. We should strive to make it better for everyone, as it benefits everyone who transits including yourself. I'm very excited for [the redesign](https://www.norfolk.gov/4784/Transit-System-Redesign), despite not using the bus much myself. While younger cities typically have it easier, with their grid street systems, bus only lanes or lightrail priority could greatly increase the desirability of taking public transit. We simply don't have much space to work with, and pre-existing roads with long standing buildings built close to them.

If you like to live in houses because you don't like crowded places, that's cool. I'd encourage you to think about what media and social cues you've absorbed over your life that may lead to you having that preference.",t2_83xfk,tapemeasured,0,1648750042.0,0,t1_i2vlun6,i2vlun6,False,DudeFromNFK,t3_tswy38,https://www.reddit.com/r/norfolk/comments/tswy38/the_hrbt_expansion_could_engineer_more_traffic/,The HRBT Expansion Could Engineer More Traffic - NFKVA,/r/norfolk/comments/tswy38/the_hrbt_expansion_could_engineer_more_traffic/i2vlun6/,3,r/norfolk,0,3

There are definitely great dining options around, if that's something you're interested in let us know what kind of experience you're looking for and I'll have some suggestions.

I agree with every other point you have, but the traffic problem is an American problem, not just a Hampton Roads problem. We have gutted our public transportation infrastructure since auto manufacturers lobbied Congress and ran ads to boost sales and have America be a personal car first society.

We need to have better public transit options. Norfolk is working on that, but we have places like Virginia Beach (voting against extending the lightrail) sabotaging some of our efforts.

"Nothing in that article is relevant to the issues we face here in Hampton roads.

For those who live in VB and Chesapeake and the south end of Norfolk maybe a different story. 

The reason there will be congestion after the HRBT expansion is complete is because they started this project 20 years to late.

"Having a garage and the size of the garage is largely influenced by the kind of community you live in. It's that way most everywhere, not just Hampton Roads. Rural communities, upper middle class, lower middle class, townhomes, you name it. They all have different garage size options. There is also the factor of how old the houses are in the area you choose to live. Different times meant different needs and it was reflected in the architecture of said times. Curious as to where you're looking to move within the area. I live in a lower middleclass community where all the homes originally came with a single car garage, which is plenty of room to for the charger and your car.

"Handsome Biscuit for the Hella Fitzgerald - a friend chicken sammich with a sweet potato biscuit bun, bacon, cheddar, and red eye pork sausage gravy. Or any of their friend chicken dishes.

Grace O'Malley's for the fish and chips and a proper pint of Guinness. Their Irish food is all quite authentic.

LeGrand Kitchen for the burger - it's a chef level version of the Big Mac and it's just about perfect. They don't have fries, though. 

The Butcher's Son in Great Bridge for their steak (or anything really.) Easily the best steak in the area outside of a stupid expensive chophouse. Their burgers are made of steak trimmings and are also to die for.

80/20 has great burgers. Doumars is a classic drive-in that made the very first waffle cones in the US - decent little burgers and fries, but go there for an ice cream in a waffle cone.

My favorite place in the area is Toast in Norfolk. Their food is really good (I have a hard time getting anything other than the Hash'n Beans Bowl with a bunch of house made Lupo hot sauce and a side of their bread, but everything them make is completely lovely - and you can eat outside in a beautiful city garden. (the inside is basically a bar, very homey feeling.) They have great cocktails and a craft beer selection as well.

"Town Point Park is a beautiful place to go for a walk in the park. If you’re lucky you’ll spot a ship or two going by. Leone’s has great food and has rooftop seating looking over the tram. The Grain at the Hilton is a good night-life restaurant, also with a roof top view (11th floor I think?) 

Lazy day at the beach is always a great way to spend the day, but know that the water is still very cold in March. Some people are in to that though. The walk in the boardwalk is worth any poor weather you might face. 

Boush Gardens should be relatively quiet this time of year, and they just got a new rollercoaster so there’s lots to do. I recommend Apollo’s Chariot and The Griffin for rides, and the best food there is either a turkey leg or funnel cake.

"Good afternoon,

Including pay on the job listings is about as difficult as googling ""city of norfolk jobs pay schedule 2021."" From that search, a link to City of Norfolk's Open Data portal can be found, particularly every employee's salary for 2021. While it may not be exactly like-for-like, since not every salary or hourly rate will be stable for new hires, it can be informative to see the broad strokes per position, per time in the position.  I went down to Table Preview to see some of the positions, it was pretty neat! 6 of the top 8 positions for the City are lawyers and psychiatrists!

To answer your second question, yes, you have that information.

Have a great day.

"Del Vecchios is very good. I'll vouch for them.

The pizza by the slice got me through college, but what really stood out to me later was their pasta.

They put their pasta dishes into one of those circular aluminum pans and put it through the pizza oven. The chicken parm is a full chicken breast, the Italian sausage is a whole link split in half, and the meatballs are store made. Any of these meats on a bed of spaghetti with sauce and cheese and put through that pizza oven to bake is an amazing (if unhealthy) feast. And it's inexpensive too.

"Its alot easier than it looks.  Basically to start out, from a stop in 1st gear, you can jist really slowly depress the clutch, try to avoid being uphill cause your vehicle will roll backwards, after awhile youll get more familiar balancing releasing the clutch + giving a lil gas, and in some cases you can play with continue pressin the brake while slowly releasing the clutch, youll feel the vehicle start to pull and thats when you start slowly releasing the brake.

Other than getting going from a stop, 1st - 2nd is the next hardest, it wont feel smooth at first, probably a little jumpy as you may feel the engine/transmission kinda jump a bit.  Youll still want to release the clutch slow, but not too slow since you can start to burn and wear the clutch.  

Just take it slow.  Theres usually no need to give it gas when changing gears and/or releasing the clutch for the most part...Aside from being stopped on a hill.  

2nd to 3rd, 3rd to 4th, etc...Should all be pretty smooth and effortless.

"You are use to it and know only Norfolk. Live somewhere else (not a similar city) for 5-10 years and go back. It is hard to have a comparison. The healthcare, customer service, drivers and overall city is rude, selfish and uncaring. 

The healthcare system is 10+ years behind the times. I had surgery with a goddamn scalpel: this doctor had no idea he could use a laser.  He botched my surgery. Another friend had surgery here and they left a fucking piece of metal in. The billing don’t get me started. I needlessly lost a friend because ob/Gyn in this city doesn’t give a damn.

The customer service is horrendous. You have to hold their hand and if they have to do more than one thing you have to reschedule. If the employee can’t figure it out, surprise neither can their manager.  They cop an attitude when you show them regulations showing what you are asking for is permissible and company policy. 

There is little to no pride in keeping the city, buildings or streets fixed and clean either. Some of the cleaning doesn’t need to be done by the city. Peoples yards for instance. Doesn’t need to be at HOA standards just don’t have trash all over your yard. I even offered to help someone: never do that again.

Very much depends on the neighborhood your vehicle is parked in overnight. My mechanic near ODU advises customers to not drop off cars after hours since another business down the block had several cats stolen from fleet trucks in one night. You also have to consider that it's a crime of opportunity. Example being it's much easier to cut the cat off a lifted truck or Jeep compared to needing to jack up a sedan to do the same.,t2_k6vx4,Edward_Scout,0,1648307951.0,0,t1_i278ksw,i278ksw,True,time2getout,t3_tomezr,https://www.reddit.com/r/norfolk/comments/tomezr/automobile_part_theft_in_norfolk/,Automobile part theft in Norfolk?,/r/norfolk/comments/tomezr/automobile_part_theft_in_norfolk/i278ksw/,3,r/norfolk,0,3

">I honestly think this area would be better off making downtown Granby st a pedestrian only area.

So they did this in the mid-70s and called it [Granby Mall](https://library.artstor.org/#/public/SS7731161_7731161_10790310).

Norfolk settles 'Hula Hoop Lady' lawsuit for $65,000 

Attorneys for Pamela Brown filed the suit, seeking $5 million, against a police officer who used a Taser on her during an October arrest. The suit claimed Brown's civil rights were violated and that the officer used excessive force.  
  
Under the terms of the agreement, there is no finding or admission of liability on the part of the officer, Nicholas G. Parks, or the city.  
  
Federal Magistrate Judge James E. Bradberry accepted the agreement Friday and indicated he would sign an order once it has been drawn up.  
  
Brown sustained a brain injury when she was hit by a truck on the day of her high school prom. Now 50, she livesindependently and is a fixture on Granby Street, where she likes to hula-hoop in the median as motorists pass by. Even the judge told Brown on Friday that he often passed her on his way to work.  
But not everyone is a fan of the radio Brown likes to play at the median. The Taser incident grew out of Parks' response to a complaint from a resident about the radio volume on the morning of Oct. 11.  
In a deposition, the police officer said Brown would not comply with his requests that she turn down the radio. He said she pushed him and hit him repeatedly in the arm with her fist when he took the radio and tried to turn it down himself.  
During the confrontation, he drew his Taser, which had a camera that captured two minutes of the incident. Brown is seen shouting, one hand cuffed. She does not put her other hand behind her back as the officer repeatedly demands.  
Her words are difficult to understand; she referred to prior injuries and her ""medic alert."" Parks said that only by later viewing the video did he understand what Brown was saying.  
She was charged with making excessive noise and with assault, but prosecutors dropped the charges the next month.  
On Friday, C. Stewart Gill Jr., her attorney, told the judge that about $17,000 of the settlement would go toward costs incurred in the suit and $26,000 toward the lawyer's fees.",t2_tw4jd,stacey1771,0,1648088420.0,0,t1_i1vqhaw,i1vqhaw,True,fuzijo,t3_tkur2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/norfolk/comments/tkur2z/be_careful_when_calling_911_for_mental_health/,Be careful when calling 911 for mental health episodes,/r/norfolk/comments/tkur2z/be_careful_when_calling_911_for_mental_health/i1vqhaw/,2,r/norfolk,0,2

"Yo I'm 24 and just moved here last month over in Ocean View/East Beach area.

There's hella breweries. I saw somebody already mentioned The Bold Mariner, but I'll +1 for that. The game night is tonight at 6:00 P.M. There's also COVA, which is a cool spot that does other events (and has beer that you pour yourself, which is a fun novelty), but it's a little smaller venue. Great spot to sit outside and talk.

Follow @nfk.va on Instagram, they do a daily rundown of literally any and every event in Norfolk on their story. 

As far as like, actually meeting people goes, I've had mild luck (read: have made 2 friends) just walking up and going ""hey I'm new here, where's cool stuff?"" Everyone's been extremely kind.

 It seems like fitness-oriented groups are one of the big ways people make new friends around here.

I've also met a few people through climbing if you're into that. 

There's also a chess club that meets most weekends at local coffee shops (no idea how many young people are into chess, but maybe?)

"Carvana is nice, but you’ll definitely overpay. The payments will be OK but the purchase price will be rather high. Got a 2013 Fiat 500C Abarth with 30k miles. For being that old it’s like new. There are some gems on there. Unfortunately, that brought the price to nearly double, because of the chip shortage, great condition and them being discontinued in 2019. 

I wouldn’t recommend it though, for just buying a grocery getter. There are better deals out there. It just depends on what you want—whether you’re going for your dreams or just a simple vehicle.

Going for a “unicorn” means taking it to the dealer, specialty shops, or working on it yourself—and having your own parts on-hand. I do this as my daily driver, but I’d highly recommend something more practical unless you already have a car.

The advantages with CarMax and Carvana, are being able to choose from cars on a national level, not just regional or in-stock. You can plausibly find anything you want, for a price. I’m not the type to settle on a car over 50k or 100k miles. Less useful life IMO.

Avoid anything with a turbo unless you’re comfortable adding oil and coolant every two weeks. I replace about a quart of oil and pint of coolant each month. I keep extra fluids in the trunk. There is an advantage in that though. Insurance charges you by engine displacement in liters. I can beat a Mustang, but my insurance is $54/mo. It’s fast, but they charge for the small engine (1.4L), not the turbocharger. The Mustang owner would pay more to insure, having the larger engine displacement. You also see better fuel economy running a smaller engine with a turbo, vice a larger engine without. Just not in my case because I get 20MPG due to driving habits. Cheaper insurance can offset a higher payment—though its more likely to require premium fuel. 

GDI engines without turbochargers, also snack on oil. It’s not unthinkable to be down 1-2 quarts before a scheduled change. Hyundai/KIA are notorious. The front end suspension also goes if you hit a single pothole. You’ll destroy a strut and sway bar pretty easily.

You can also buy a used Prius with a dead pack. If you can safely work with high voltage, the cells can be replaced individually. It’s something you can YouTube and DIY at your own risk. People frequently sell them cheap not wanting to go through the hassle or expense of replacing or rebuilding the battery bank.",t2_iotnjhrw,bradleynanthony,0,1647808968.0,0,t1_i1g4xui,i1g4xui,True,Theoriginalkylee,t3_tipxg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/norfolk/comments/tipxg7/looking_for_a_car/,Looking for a car,/r/norfolk/comments/tipxg7/looking_for_a_car/i1g4xui/,1,r/norfolk,0,1

"The real issue are plea deals and bargains made with DAs/police. Mandatory minimum sentencing needs to be stricter with increased penalties. Committing crime is all about the risk/reward factor for criminals. To say criminals are irrational isn't really the truth. Criminals rationalize acts/behaviors based on the likely hood of consequences for their actions. If you make it a mandatory. The mandatory minimum for using a gun in the commission of a crime is 3 years. In hindsight, 3 years is absolute nothing; we've spent almost 3 years in lockdowns as it is.

"So here an interesting aside. I used to hang out with a guy who taught at the bad kids school, forgive me I can’t remember the name of it, but it’s where kids went when they had been expelled from any other viable school. He has been teaching there for probably 20 or more years at this point. 

He said “it’s really interesting teaching those kids because they don’t process future consequences.” A direct quote. He said if a kid was acting up, you can’t threaten like with “normal”kids “if you do that again you’re going to get x,y,x” because it literally has no impact. Only after the incident, when they are facing immediate punishment do they register the ramifications of their actions. 

It was really neat hearing some of his experiences there and a lot can, I think, be linked to society.

Also, how does a place that preaches so much about authentic Irish cuisine not even have colcannon on the menu? 

For this type of cuisine, the best I've tasted in the area by light years (flavor and portion size) is Park Lane Tavern in Kempsville.

They want me to meet a $75 minimum when as a party of 10 in the main dining room we wouldn’t hit that, so I’m disappointed because the catering/private dining plans feel inflated and they won’t let me just make a 10-person reservation.

To get you on the water, I'd suggest taking the [Elizabeth River Ferry](https://gohrt.com/routes/ferry/) ($2 single trip, $4.50 1-day GoPass) from Norfolk's [Waterside District](https://watersidedistrict.com/) to Portsmouth's [Olde Towne](https://oldetowneportsmouth.com/) to visit [Fish N Slips](https://fishnslips.com/) if you like seafood, or [Legend Brewing Depot](https://www.legendbrewing.com/portsmouth.asp) if you don't for views of Norfolk, food+drink and a walk along the River Front Park. [Lightship Portsmouth Museum](https://portsmouthnavalshipyardmuseum.com/lightship/) is closed but you can still view the exterior while you're there.

Not sure when they're starting back up for 2022, but [Norfolk Kayak Rentals](https://www.norfolkkayaks.fun/) could be another option for you if the timing of your trip works.

Chrysler Museum is great as well, and depending on when you're in town they might even have a glass blowing demonstration going on.

"Fear of missing out and remote working. The issue isn't so much as lack of inventory, its really a lack of move-in ready homes in super nice areas. If you look online then locally there's plenty of homes in south norfolk and portsmouth that are sitting around. People are extremely.picky however and unwilling to make sacrifices 

Work from home has been a huge culprit though. People with white collar jobs that used to live in cities would have easily been able to afford a $2k a month rent or $700k house. This meant People earning less could fill the lower cost housing or those that lived in suburbs or country could afford homes at their income lowers

The shift to digital working has meant these people with large salaries move to areas with lower housing costs, outbid each other, and increase the listing proces. This has destroyed the ability for middle class workers to buy a house that was once economically viable for them. They of course can't move to big cities and if did, wouldn't be able to afford housing there

If prices do dip as interest rates peak, the dip won’t be as sharp here as markets that are seriously overpriced. 

If you captured from gains where you are now, I think you will be fine. Give it three years and mortgage rates will dip and you can refinance…

Summer buying season does get stupid with bidding wars and then trying to use a VA loan might get you stuck on the sidelines unless you’re able to buy at appraisal plus $30K (cash) for example. That was the scenario last summer. 

Also, that’s close to a realtor’s take…so if you skip the realtors and buy from a private seller, your appraisal can put the same cash in a seller’s pocket. Just gotta get smart if you go this route.
