"I originally didn't write out any of the how but I thought maybe someone reading through this would wonder. It's just a type of desensitizing dog training and then training the dog to call off . It's not some magic trickery but just exposure and repetition.  There are lurkers who read things and I type for others as much or more than for your entertainment. 

We have had a mom and two calves plus a year old around my place all winter. The calves died in the deep snow down on the Tanana a ways. Mom and the older calf still around. 

My dog is a 40lb Alaska husky mutt.

We encountered moose more in Anchorage (moved up here a year ago). The dog parks in Anchorage have moose who just live in the parks. So I had the chance to train him to call off moose earlier and often. They are all over in Anchorage, up here they have more room away from roads to be. We saw them at least weekly but for sure less here. 

My dog has encountered deer in AZ and cows. All the same skills transfer to call him off them and to have him keep space. My dog will kill chickens though.

You don't know what my dog will do, but I do have a pretty good idea what he is gonna do and honestly if he gets kicked by a moose at this point that is his problem and fault because I have communicated to him to avoid them. My dog would bark at you in the woods before a moose.",t2_6nhv5ynb,ccnnvaweueurf,0,1648971866.0,0,t1_i376rxz,i376rxz,False,firedragonguy666,t3_tuxq2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fairbanks/comments/tuxq2h/next_gun_specifically_for_the_area/,Next gun specifically for the area?,/r/Fairbanks/comments/tuxq2h/next_gun_specifically_for_the_area/i376rxz/,1,r/Fairbanks,0,1
"Good on you. Most dogs don’t see moose every day. I’m not reading your novel btw but I’m assuming when you said “I trained my dog using the moose in my yard” that your pretty much mr Alaska and can’t be wrong. I live in the middle of nowhere and have seen two moose three times in the last 2 years here. Kinda difficult to accustom a dog with that kind of frequency. 

Thing is, you don’t know what your dog is going to do if you’re out camping/hiking.  the dog isn’t in their comfort space, the moose is. The dogs home isn’t being invaded, the mooses is.  And when dogs are nervous and away from home, their instinct is to protect, their first line is to bark. But sure, your chihuahua will know to keep quiet when a moose walks into your space. Because you trained then every day by being around a moose that it got used to.",t2_cm6fygz3,SorryTree1105,0,1648971465.0,0,t1_i3769x7,i3769x7,False,firedragonguy666,t3_tuxq2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fairbanks/comments/tuxq2h/next_gun_specifically_for_the_area/,Next gun specifically for the area?,/r/Fairbanks/comments/tuxq2h/next_gun_specifically_for_the_area/i3769x7/,-1,r/Fairbanks,0,-1
"It's not that hard to train dogs to not chase moose. Some dogs might be hard, but for many dogs not that hard. 

With moose I mostly worry if there is a calf and just give them space.

I taught my dog to avoid moose by using one laying in the front yard one time as a training tool. Get ready to go on a walk, go to front door, see moose, I panic and back us up into house. Rinse repeat all night a couple times an hour and never go on a walk, just bathroom break in back yard. This was in Anchorage, but then going forward I can easily slow him off and avoid a moose with eye contact and some verbal prompting or pointing. I think dog knows the ASL sign for moose, I think. I don't know if he gets it, but I tell him ""that thing will fuckin kill you bub"". 

My dog naturally alerts to bear scent. His body language changes, his ears get really erect and the ears vibrate while he looks at me with a hard look. If I don't go that direction then in 2 years I have seen older scat but no bears. Granted although in the woods we are not in the most wild places out there. If we find wolf or wolverine tracks in the winter he gets really tense too, but it's different with bears. The ears vibrating is subtle but with bear scent.",t2_6nhv5ynb,ccnnvaweueurf,0,1648970802.0,0,t1_i375frk,i375frk,False,firedragonguy666,t3_tuxq2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fairbanks/comments/tuxq2h/next_gun_specifically_for_the_area/,Next gun specifically for the area?,/r/Fairbanks/comments/tuxq2h/next_gun_specifically_for_the_area/i375frk/,1,r/Fairbanks,0,1

"We may buy at some point.

Long drives are nothing for us, and ice driving is not a foreign concept but we are spoiled I'm that it is usually only for three or four months that we have to deal with that. 

I think the long weeks of deep cold may be the biggest adjustment for us to get used to or perhaps the dark. Idk I personally think it'll be cool to see and I love new experiences, being prepared is important. I just hope we make this move as seamless as possible. I think the kids are young enough it won't be too much of an adjustment.

"I grew up in southcentral AK and have left some. Lived ages 9-15 in northern VA where there was like 1 million people in 400 sq miles.. Was interesting dichotomy then graduated in Wasilla. I noticed a difference with students I went to school with and racism they had that was based simply in not knowing. I went to school with kids who's families were at one point from many many places in VA. Which was cool, and many people growing up solely in Wasilla don't get. I haven't been back to VA since 15 and have no real plans to.

I have hitch hiked around and done some travel down south and west USA and I just keep coming back to AK. Will be here until I die. Leaving for some warm weather in the winter some is nice though.

I moved to Fairbanks to rent a dry cabin which has increased my quality of life being as cheap as having 3 roommates and I have my own space plus outdoor space, landlords have a greenhouse, next to a river. Much better than Anchorage, but I do miss the city trail system in Anchorage and the parks and dog parks. 

The winter time rains are far more common than they were 20 years ago. Noticeably so down in Anchorage. 

Here we got 1 rain event, whereas it's been on and off all winter in Anchorage this last year.

I'm very interested in Yak as they can be stocked at 1/3rd the density of cows. They also are cold hardy and produce wool. They require just a 2 sided shelter in Delta Junction. 

There was a program through the federal government for that yes. IDK if still.

I have a buddy in Sitka that got a federal agriculture grant to buy chicken wire for holding wood chips for his food mushroom small farm.

Anything going in Oct of Dec really has no impact on most agriculture as there is not much growing of crops going on then. 

I'm interested in algae farming and am going to aim for producing and freezing enough for me to eat like 1 cup wet per day, so 365 cups 22 gallons. Dry some, freeze some. Then figure out what it would take to scale. 

Desperation is a subdivision out old murphy dome road that burnt out in a fire a few years ago and the state sold lots in there in this last years DNR auction. It's fresh enough burn that nothing has grown back and the pictures connected with the name... look desperate. 

I'm hopeful to get something in the 20-40 acre range because then if given 5 years getting 2-10 acres cleared is doable with more work and less $ and less heavy machinery. Draft animals are very interesting to me.

 I could scrape up the payments to DNR and down payment on a 80 or 100 acre parcel (since they only want 5% down) but then would have no capital for land clearing, fencing etc. If I buy non agriculture land it'll probably be 3 to 10 acres depending on how close to town and if from state or private party.

Where did your family move from? Mine came up in the Palmer Colony in the 30's and then homesteading in the 50s. Grandfather actually came up to Fairbanks for army during WW2, much better placement than could be.. Had extended family coming up before then though. Fort Wainwright was Ladd Field back then. Now I'm curious of photos of the base from then as I have never seen any.

"> as the winters get less harsh and the growing season continues to grow longer. 

Yah, is one of the reasons I'm here among many others.(including hating ""city life""...) essentially with climate change and related changes in regional respective seasons much of what was borderline inhospitable arctic will see a lot of productivity improvements.

When my late brother got assigned here we came up with somewhat of a plan to try and get a productive ranch/farm going down the road... things didn't workout on his end, but pops and I are still here to see what we can do. 

>We already have 10-30 extra frost free days per year than 30ish years ago.

And we get weird shit like the December freezing rains, and the Halloween time warm spiel... once things equalize a bit I'm sure we will see some months worth of extra functional growing season in between it all. You know, even with some minor frost here and there we can have many crops in production that can tolerate those, but not random Crashes to 0F/-18C. 

Would love to get some of that farmland really and see about getting grants for hoop houses and such for growing stuff. If memory serves there is a program where one can get paid per sqft to construct them. 

>IDK if they are thinking about this kinda thing though.

Probably a thing really in between regional needs to come, likely future institutional needs go.(insert corruption and related conspiracy theories as needed)

"Personally  I expect over 100 years the population of the interior will grow as the winters get less harsh and the growing season continues to grow longer. We already have 10-30 extra frost free days per year than 30ish years ago.

As population grows and people leave the equator due to heat and climate change they will drift north. I expect the state will sell better land in the future with more demand. IDK if they are thinking about this kinda thing though.

The state in the 1960s to 2000s basically sold mostly the worst land. Some gems but overall difficult access. Like my aunt and uncles property in Talketna they got dirt cheap from the state in the early 1980s but it's like 12 miles of trail to access and back then there was like no development and the trail was barely a thing.

"In terms of mortality rate I just googled it.  The 7 day average last week was 889/day with a new case rate of 47k for the US.  That’s 0.02% but you have to take into account the number of people who have COVID but didn’t get tested which is likely extremely high.  Many people are asymptomatic-mildly symptomatic and don’t get tested.  That death rate is even lower if you look at the disease since it started.  And to my point about healthy lifestyle, the vast majority (not all) of people with serious reactions to the disease have numerous comorbidities (old age, obesity, etc.) not saying those deaths aren’t relevant, just a point.  But try to eat healthy and nutritious food. Get adequate sleep.  Do some exercise.  Get sunlight exposure.  It makes a word of difference

In terms of treatments - Monoclonal antibodies are effective along with some other drugs.

Empirically, over the whole 2 years of the pandemic know many people who got it and all were ok.

I live a job with quite a bit of travel all across the US.  And I can say, particularly in the southeast, life has been going on quite normally for well over a year.

Again.  Nothing you do will mitigate all associated risk. But in my humble opinion, i don’t imagine this disease is going to go away anytime soon so I along with many people have decided to figure a way to live with it

Noone wants to be talking remotely anymore. We still have to for class, and most folks are somewhat sick of it. Social meetups are happening again here.

This town, the people thrive on activities. There are always races for skiing, running, biking; sports, both winter and summer.  If you dont do those things, you won't have much to talk about to these people.

"Hi,

I am not much different from you in that I was just in college and also just focused on meeting folks from Fairbanks. I was pretty successful finding people looking at hobby groups online. Fairbanks is a hobbyists heaven. I was able to meet people looking for gear on Craigslist and Marketplace, I found ways to meet people looking at club websites (for me it was mushing and distance running because those are my hobbies) but if you're into hunting, gaming, etc there's websites stuff out there for sure. A lot of people in Alaska don't have social media, and I admit if you did it would help a lot, but my suggestion is get familiar with the businesses and figure out where people go. And tbh, take a trip up there if you can afford it! I went in February and met so many people, all amazing, and it was an amazing experience. The people are the best up there.

"Most of the time, there's little to none. We do however have two peculiar circumstances where it can get noticeably bad.

1: Forest fire smoke rolls into town during the summer. It doesn't happen every summer, since it depends on where the forest fires are that year and where the winds take smoke, but it has the potential to get quite bad for multiple weeks at a time. Also of note, when it does roll in it tends to trap heat, so sometimes we're faced with the option of using our fans to cool off, but also pumping smoky air into our houses.

2: Temperature inversion during the winter. Because our winters can get exceptionally cold, it can cause a thermal inversion where the cold air close to the ground is trapped in place by warmer air above it; pollution from buildings and cars gets trapped along with it. This is usually less of a problem because it only happens when it's really cold, and you don't want to be outside at -40 for very long anyway.",t2_56efq,secretpandalord,0,1648643835.0,0,t1_i2phdq5,i2phdq5,True,[deleted],t3_trt98x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fairbanks/comments/trt98x/how_is_pollution_in_fairbanks/,How is pollution in Fairbanks?,/r/Fairbanks/comments/trt98x/how_is_pollution_in_fairbanks/i2phdq5/,4,r/Fairbanks,0,4

The city burns coal all year, resulting in radioactive and heavy metal laden fly ash. And the ""suburbanites"" burn wood for most of the year.

The town experiences weather inversion that traps pollution, so escaping to the hills brings some relief. But then you have to deal with radon

Air alerts are common and widespread, and there are a plethora of health concerns. 

However, most residents seem to find one reason or another to overlook these risks for other quality of life improvements. That is a decision you must make

"Have two cars and neither has had any issues driving in winter. 

20 odd year old 4runner with 2wd, and a superduty dually with 4wd. Both have generic all-weather tires. Never had a need for dedicated winter tires in town. Have some chains for a backup, as well as sand/gravel, shovels and some plank alongside other supplies in both vehicles though.

Key there being that I drive carefully during winter... No speeding, no sudden moves, no cellphone use when behind the wheel.  Even with slippery conditions its still fine as long as one drives carefully. Being said every year we have a ton of new arrivals in town and more than a few will leave their vehicles in a ditch/embankment for winter storage for some time. This year had a record number of people who actually managed to flip their cars over in the process too.

I went to the home show today at the Carlson center.  There was lots of good info there.  I asked an engineer who builds engineered ""log"" houses about this.

He said there are basically 2 factors: thermal mass of the structure and length of time you are away.

The greater the thermal mass the more likely you want to keep the temp steady as it takes a lot of energy to reheat the thermal mass.  He said in general with a moderate amount of thermal mass in a typical house he would lower the temp if he was gone for the weekend but not for a normal work day.  I asked about a yurt.  He said since it would likely have so little thermal mass he would lower the temp even if he was gone for a regular work day.",t2_dbv9k,MinerDon,0,1648345218.0,0,t1_i29ie3v,i29ie3v,False,uhhhttorney,t3_tk5i58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fairbanks/comments/tk5i58/house_heating_cost/,House heating cost,/r/Fairbanks/comments/tk5i58/house_heating_cost/i29ie3v/,2,r/Fairbanks,0,2

I plan to get plain black steel wheels in 16 inch because the tires are cheaper and the sidewall is bigger giving more cushion for the bump

I run studless michillin Ipike 3's and they are good tires. I also really like firestone weather grip tires because they can be used in the shoulder seasons in slightly wintry conditions and they sipe rain and mud very very well.

I used to have a rear wheel drive (2wd) suv that I paid $500 for and and I paid $880 for tires. Then I sold the SUV running but with a nearly failed clutch and a bad slave cylinder for $300 and the tires for $360 a couple years later.

I used to have a subaru I paid $500 for and it came with winter tires that brand new were like $700.

"The GI [aurora forecast](https://www.gi.alaska.edu/monitors/aurora-forecast) is helpful, but it can be confusing because the times/dates are often presented in UST which is 9 hours off from AKST. So just be aware.

There is some predictability to the aurora strength, I can see now from the forecast for instance that April 1 and April 2nd are forecasted to be moderate strength (5 out of 10). But that doesn't actually tell you where the aurora will be visible. 

For short term you can look at the [SWPC](https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/) page which has a picture of where they think the aurora will be visible at any given time with like a 1 hour forecast. 

But the best luck I've had catching a lot of shows is to set up a network of friends where you all just agree to text each other when there's a good show.

"You're kind of asking a loaded question, but it's not your fault. I used to live in Fairbanks, but I would love to move back. However, just to illuminate for you why this is loaded, there's a mentality perpetuated that Anchorage isn't *real* Alaska or that its residents think they are better. What I have learned since moving here is that I haven't met a single person in Anchorage that doesn't have other places in Alaska that they love. No one here thinks they are better than anyone else. Other than wasilla. 😉

You have more access to things from Anchorage, but Fairbanks is a lot simpler and both offer things the other doesn't. So I would suggest that you find what you would like to do and go from there.

Do you like kayaking or canoeing? Still a split decision. You have a river in Fairbanks or a lake in eklutna.

99% of that was during the ice storm and in one block of time.

During the ice storm a ice chunk slid off the roof and knocked the wood stove chimney lopsided. Got that fixed and then another round of weather came in a few days later which is what took out the power.

"You can drive 15 mins from town up Ballaine Rd and there’s a “parking lot” on the right side of the road where people congregate to view it. Drive north and as soon as the trees clear, you pull off to a wide open sky. If you see Ballaine on the map, it’s the part that looks like a nose and past the big hill. You can’t miss the wide clearing of trees and Ballaine isn’t a long road. To check on viewing download the Aurora app. It’s purple and blue icon and it’ll give you live forecast and a visual, then cross reference with the weather app for clouds. Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday the Aurora will be strong and should be clear skies Sunday night after clouds move out and should be clear Monday and Tuesday. Be patient when waiting. Sometimes it takes an hour of waiting to get to the good stuff so 10pm-3am it could come and go at any time because it dances in and out of view. Even if the Aurora isn’t out, the stars are pretty and you can almost make out a dim Milky Way arm. Best wishes and enjoy your vacation!

PS. Also view this, it’s a webcam nearby and I use it because there’s too many trees at my place so I go to that spot I mentioned after checking.

"> Are the auroras still up?

The aurora happens when it happens, all year round, at irregular intervals. What you need to *see* it is darkness and clear skies. There isn't anything you can do about the clear skies. As for the darkness, right now, anywhere away from town and away from major highways in the middle of the night will do. I usually head north of town to the Goldstream Valley -- perhaps somewhere around [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@64.9467793,-147.8073464,1045m/data=!3m1!1e3).

"Ship nothing that doesn’t fit in your car. Tires will be more expensive but not so much for the inconvenience. Travel simply. You won’t need winter tires until Sept or later. Mostly clothes and personal outdoor gear. Buy a copy of the Milepost, usually Barnes and Noble has them. You will not need any other guide for planning your trip up or the fun when you get here. When my kids went kayaking in Prince William sound with a UAF guide it was mandated they have a 3 layer system. Light Silk, or wool first layer, middle layer like fleece or wool, or high tech fabric, then your rugged insulated outerwear. You won’t need three layers unless you’re doing outside activity from the interior or above on the coldest days, some exceptions apply. Alaska used to have 7 distinct climate regions. No one knows exactly what these are anymore. See Milepost for details. If you can afford it I highly recommend  taking you vehicle and you the Alaska Marine Hwy Ferry from Prince Rupert BC. It may even be cheaper than gas thru Canada right now  but it’s an experience like no other. It’s basically a 4 day cruise vagabond cruise with time to exit at every port. Support the local Warangal school district and buy some raw uncut gumball sized garnets as you grab a bite and stretch you legs at port in Wrangall. You can camp in a small tent on some of the decks. See milepost. Lots of people take up residence in the front lounge or even the movie lounge.  Yes you can sleep on the floors or rent a cabin. You can drive the Haines Hwy out some other time which is designated one of the works most beautiful hwys. It’s even more scenic heading south than coming north.

"It really blows conservatives minds when you're both a leftist who hates Biden and Kamala Harris for *legitimate* reasons, and you own guns.

The largest growing demographic of first-time gun-owners in 2020 were leftists *because* of the actions of far right extremists and the Overton Window dragging single-issue conservatives with them.

What bugs me was the co-opting of libertarian by expanded capitalist marketeers and ancaps who thinks that unregulated businesses would balance itself out, which obviously doesn't work out and just sharpens the divide between those who have capital compared to those who don't.

And in order to distance yourself from those people, you'd describe it as libertarian-socialism, or left libertarian. And then they get confused because they can't understand that it's not as mutually exclusive as you'd think. It's just that they don't even know the history of where 'libertarian' came from, which were anarchists in the working class that demanded many of the concepts of government we have today.

"I sold a 225k mile 97 in 2019 for $700 with good snow tires

Reconstruct title from rear end crash 15 years prior, and engine rebuild around 150k 

Then owner before me twice backed into something and blew out the rear hatch. Put a junk yard one on, then blew that out and gave up and I bought it with a plastic visqueen rear window.

I then dropped another junkyard hatch during the install and then drove it that winter with the visqueen vs get another.. I had two broken hatches on the ground, glass everywhere and a car with no rear door

It burned like 1 quart of oil every 1,000 miles and the previous owner rarely checked oil level..

I whipped some really really good shitties in that thing. Snow plumes so big it would suck in snow and shut off then I restarted it with a rev and hit er again.

Sold it because it needed an oil change, radiator flush, brakes and soonish would need CV joints and shocks.

I think today in the current market since it ran and drove I probably could get $1,500-$1,800.

"Ah ok. Well typically it's super cloudy in town, the air inversion traps a cloud/smog later. I have seen it from my house here, but it was a rare high Aurora. Creamers field is a good option if clear skies!

That same website has an all sky camera north of town. Use that to see if the Aurora is out at night; that tells me if it's worth it to go looking.

The highways are fine to drive on, just pretend your car is floating and take corners slower. There's an overlook on the parks highway ~30 mins from town that usually is clear from the clouds.

"It's still a bit early to predict well, but I wish you luck.

You can definitely just go to the Chena yourself in your rental, but be careful on the road out there. There are frost heaves in parts closer to town that need to be taken slowly or the car will bounce severely on the suspension and can be hard to control. They're marked with signs. If you take the tour there, use it to recon the road conditions; you can decide whether or not to drive back yourself. Their heated Aurora viewing room is up a short trail and you don't actually need to pay a tour company or be a guest to use it, just don't advertise the fact unduly. People also warm up in the cafe and then walk out to the airstrip.

"I was a driver\guide for a tour company in Fairbanks for some time, and did aurora tours this time of year. I honestly can't recommend it to the average tourist with a limited time frame. I spent a lot of time trying to gently let down and explain the elusive nature of aurora with perfect conditions to disappointed people who had shelled out a lot. If everything aligns, its truly amazing, but it may just as easily cloud over and snow, or be perfectly clear and not have a show. It wouldn't be special if it was easy to show up and see, and that's not just a line.

I don't feel good about sending you to good viewing spots if you've never driven where you might encounter ice or snow, but there are plenty of pull outs and viewpoints in the greater area. Check out conditions on the Elliot highway, for example. Do not, under any circumstances, attempt to go up the Dalton Highway with your level of experience, even if your rental allows it.

"Uber has something called uberx where you sign in one place and could get dispatched rides or deliveries.

I currently run uber, doordash, and instacart in fairbanks. Uber deliveries pay more but I sit waiting much longer because priority goes to drivers who also take passengers. Doordash is the busiest and gets me the most trips. Insta cart I just started and the batches can be pretty big. But I have only done a few in-between dashes.

Someone who drives for Uber and lyft told me they started as a dasher. Now he does just rides becauseof a physical reason so he can walk less. He said one paid better and the other kept him more busy so he runs both apps but that he make double what he did as a dasher and barely steps out of his car.
