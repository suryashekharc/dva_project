"My family of three were hiking the short distance to the Trilobite Site from the parking lot, when I heard voices calling out.  I dismissed them as erroneously heard bug/ambient sounds, because it was a 100¬∞ July day outside Caliente and we were alone.

We were out for about 45 minutes.  Driving away from the site I asked my husband if he enjoyed my little rock hounding excursion, and he said sure....but he kept hearing these voices call out on the way *back* to the truck (which I did not hear).

The voices, to me, sounded like there was a man uphill, perhaps directly to my right up a ~30¬∞ incline, yelling down to someone on my left, down a less steep slope towards the highway.  So, close enough so that I would expect the crunch of sand underfoot or see ATV dust.  My husband said similar.  People talking casually.

I can't explain how alone we were.  You know it when you are.  If there were hunters I don't know why they were yelling.  If there were ATV's we would have seen the trailer, or tracks, or heard engines.

He was very unsettled and sure we had encountered....something.

You really drive the last point home by implying politicians have any control over supply chain and price inflation. What state law could be passed that would fix prices? Most of the food comes from CA and oil prices are set in international markets. Prices to transport shipping containers by truck or boat have been elevated since the pandemic began-- we can't just flip a switch and magically have more transport capacity and drivers. Oil companies have no incentive to make intensive capital investments in new exploration when everyone knows these elevated oil prices will come down in the next year (already off the highs).

I couldn't agree more. We have always been independent. I think this state has been that way since Laxalt. Reid was a great Nevadan until they made him senate majority leader and he started pulling the company line. The problem I see nowadays is that no politician is an American first and a Democrat or Republican second. They don't care about America or the people. They care about the power and the wealth it generates. I truly think they look at it as a way to line their pockets. Maesto is a Pelosi puppet. Just the same as Adam Laxalt is a Trump puppet.

I noticed you didn't try to counter any of the points i made. The reason is because you can't. GOP has done some horrible shit but they aren't responsible for the current problems we have. It was not them who heavily intervened in the economy during covid (largely) which caused massive inflation. They also did not make California unlivable causing people to flee to Nevada and Arizona driving up the cost of housing.  You initially claimed those issues was the result of the GOP capitalism.

I'm working off information that compares 2016  to 2022, and that's all that particular article gave us.

If we just look at current info, with out looking back, we can't verify their claims of ""its looks bad for dems""

Analyzing the article and guessing a bit. 

> The state‚Äôs share of registered Democrats has fallen ‚Äî from 39.4 percent in 2016 to 33.6 percent in February, according to figures from the Nevada secretary of state. At the same time, more than 28 percent of registered voters are now unaffiliated with any party, an increase from 20 percent in 2016. 

so in 2016 we had 39.6 Dem, and 20 unaffiliated.  leaving 40.4 for Republicans and 3rd parties. 

In February 2022  we are at 33.5 Dem, 28 unaffiliated, leaving 38.4 for Republicans and 3rd parties. 

It could just be that republicans want to vote in the primary, and democrats don't since they have nearly all the offices.  Or it could be people switching.    If that large increase in unaffiliated was all from automatic voter registrations,  I'd expect both R and D per cents to go down about the same amount.

"I think it comes down to whether you're picturing Nevada, or Vegas. Sort of like how a cheesesteak is classic Philly cuisine and Philly is the biggest population center in PA, but if you asked someone about classic ""Pennsylvania"" cuisine, you'd probably get more Pennsylvania Dutch recommendations.

Other comments have covered Basque cuisine and steak in general, which is what feelsthe most like 'Nevada' culture to me.

But for Vegas foods, I'd say the casino buffet is a real classic. Every casino has at least one, they're usually HUGE and varied, and they tend to have high-end foods compared to regular American buffets (though not necessarily high *quality*, so read reviews)! Same for fancy cocktail bars.

I can't recommend a specific one because I haven't been to any since they've reopened after covid (assuming they even have reopened...I'm from the rurals). But definitely a dive into Las Vegas (so technically Nevadan) culture.

Edit: oh, and since you're doing many states...I'm originally from Philly, and I'd say aside from cheesesteaks, a roast pork and broccoli rabe sandwich is where it's at. For PA Dutch food, hit up a smorgasbord to try a variety of classics, and buy some soft pretzels before you leave because they're great fresh but also great in a few days as long as you keep them in a sealed container.",t2_zgpvp,stopcounting,0,1648778665.0,0,t1_i2xizqu,i2xizqu,True,thatblackman,t3_ttdy20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nevada/comments/ttdy20/what_is_the_best_cuisine_in_nevada_what_are_some/,What is the best cuisine in Nevada?

"University of Salzburg. It says it in the paragraph right before the expense allowance. You can also see it in the link ""...sbg.ac.at..."" which is the official domain of University of Salzburg (sbg = Salzburg). I am surprised you didn't see the paragraph, since you copied part of the informed consent right before and after that part. I don't know though, where the comment has gone in which you cited the consent since I'm new to reddit (as you are correctly mentioning). 

To your other questions: confidentiality can be ensured because prior to being allowed conducting, this research had to go through the equivalent of IRB (Institutional Review Board) in Salzburg. To get IRBs approval I had to sign a letter of confidentiality which makes me personally reliable for any misconduct or ethical violations.  In the informed consent there is even an official email address and link a person can contact, in case they think I violated regulations. You could btw. sign up to this study with an e-mail that does not include any information about you as a person. Additionally, when the data is collected in the following two surveys, they are anonymised by the participant generating a code. This way it is not possible for me to link any data to an e-mail address submitted.

Apart from that, I had to hand in a twelve page application form informing IRB about every detail of the planned study. Not only obvious topics like overview, ethical considerations and targeted population. But also lit review, methods and statistics. The entire process of getting the approval took me 5 months. This is actually quite fast, considering the IRB meets once a month and you have to hand in everything at least two weeks prior to their meeting. Where it gets really messed up, though, is, that IRB takes at least one week to review your application. If they have any complaint, your application gets rejected and you have to hand in a revised application. This leaves you with one week to change what ever they objected to or else you have to wait another six weeks for their next meeting. 

I hope that answers your questions. If not, please let me know.

P.S.: I realise that this isn't really something you would consider ""hard"" evidence. But I hope you understand that any ""hard"" evidence I would provide is connected to me as a person. And since we are still in the wondrous internet, I'm cautious when it comes to that.

"Reno-Tahoe Odyssey will be the best experience if you can find a group. I noticed you‚Äôre doing this for all the states and if you‚Äôre trying to do something spectacular, this is it. You will probably end up doing more mileage than you are asking but it will be worth it if you can flex your recovery schedule.

The Silver State 50/50 in Reno is also a well know course and they have options outside of the 50 miler/50k. Beautiful views and very competitive and fun running community behind this one.

Escape from Prison Hill is one of my favorites in Carson City. It‚Äôs a good amount of elevation gain so you get incredible views. It‚Äôs competitive and well know in the running community but, it‚Äôs also very fun and a lot of people dress up. 

The Red Rock 10 Mile Challenge is a good one in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also a great time of year (Mid October) since most races are very late spring/summer heavy. I also hear good things about the Rock‚ÄôN‚ÄôRoll Marathon.

"She‚Äôs not wrong. Ordinarily we would like to see competitive districts but when one half of the politicians act in good faith to create competitive districts while the other half act in bad faith to give themselves an advantage, you end up trading good faith politicians for bad faith ones who want to run the government in order to cripple it and waste everyone‚Äôs time and money. 

Our politics have become a prisoners dilemma. Cooperation would yield the best outcomes for both sides but when one side chooses to act in bad faith, they end up outcompeting the good faith politicians. What‚Äôs the solution? One side has to wipe out the other. The problem with that in our case is that the GOP doesn‚Äôt know what to do once it catches the car. We saw this under Trump. Another tax cut for the wealthiest, more dogshit and culture wars for everyone else while government is neutered and dismantled. The GOP strategy is political nihilism. Which sucks for everyone who can‚Äôt afford to buy a house or travel at will. That‚Äôs most of America an in particular, most of the GOP. But many of them don‚Äôt care about anything but culture wars and their ‚Äúsingle issues‚Äù

"I was going to be a teacher, then I moved to the Reno/Carson area and saw that they don't actually want teachers. The salary is enough to live comfortably only if you have a roommate or two.

"Totally agree that waiting till you have 20% to put down is not necessary.  For a first time home buyer, you can put something crazy like only 3% or 3.5% down.  You'll need to pay PMI in the range of $150-$300 per month until you have 20% equity, but that means (a) you get to start putting money into your mortgage instead of rent many years sooner since you don't need to save up for years to get to that insane $100k down payment, and (b) if the value of the house goes up you benefit instead of needing to pay for it when you can finally afford the 20% several years into the future.  Generally, the PMI is worth it in terms of getting into the house sooner and at a lower price.

Often new homes price the upgrades into the upfront cost, not necessarily just into the total price of the house.  So to get 50K in upgrades you may need to fork over an additional 25k or so at the time of closing.  Each developer is different but definitely look into that.  15K for closing costs is pretty reasonable.  Specifically compare the lender you choose for closing costs because that can vary a lot from lender to lender.  And, seriously consider whether you should use the lender and title company that the developer asks you to use.  It is your legal right to pick the lender and title company you want, and developers often have their own company act as the lender and title company which just means they make more off of you.

So, in sum, you could probably buy the house with $50k-$75k depending on how the upgrades get charged, up front or just tacked onto the total price tag and built into the mortgage.",t2_89nf2,existenjoy,0,1647897722.0,0,t1_i1kxy7l,i1kxy7l,True,Iscratchmybutt,t3_tizlwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nevada/comments/tizlwn/how_much_would_i_need_to_save_to_buy_a_nice_house/,How much would I need to save to buy a nice house in Henderson?,/r/Nevada/comments/tizlwn/how_much_would_i_need_to_save_to_buy_a_nice_house/i1kxy7l/,1,r/Nevada,0,1

"If having a brand new house is not important to you (as it was to my wife), then I would not get a new construction. One of the big benefits of new construction is that you can pick and choose all the upgrades you want.

But stuff that‚Äôs more important to my wife than me. If I was a single guy and looking to buy, I wouldn‚Äôt buy a new construction.

This was the source for some of the other facts mentioned: https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/590299/atomic-soldiers/

YouTube footage: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MOismCI5er4

And an excellent, excellent old government video: https://archive.org/details/ExerciseDesertRock1951

This video shows exactly what they wanted to say: soldiers should have no fear of atomic arms and should continue battle without concern - ‚Äúwith confidence.‚Äù

The text posted with that video ‚Ä¶

>In 1951, the Army, working with the Atomic Energy Commission, carried out the Desert Rock Exercises, an experiment to ""dispel much of the fear and uncertainty surrounding atomic radiation and the effects of gamma and x-rays.""

>A tent encampment was set up about 27 miles from where the atomic explosions were detonated on the Nevada Proving Grounds. The encampment housed about 5,000 Army soldiers, civilian observers and technicians. Troops spent hours in classes receiving training in radiation and nuclear weapons effects.

>The following is a recorded interview between a sergeant and a training officer prior to a blast:

>Question. ""How many of your men would volunteer to go up and be in the 
foxholes?"" (one-half mile from ground zero)

>Answer. ""I guess about half a dozen.""

>Question. ""It's quite a loud noise when that bomb goes off ... would it do 
them any harm?""

>Answer. ""No sir, not the noise, no.""

>Question. ""How about the radiation? Do you think there is much danger?""

>Answer. ""Radiation is the least of their worries that the men are thinking 
about.""

>Question. ""I think most thought radiation was the greatest danger, didn't 
they? Where did they learn differently?""

>Answer. ""They were, prior to our instructions here. We received a very 
thorough briefing.""

>For the Desert Rock I Exercise, the weapon was fired as an airburst. The majority of the troops were out in the open about seven miles away. The soldiers were told to crouch down and face away from the blast. The bomb flash blanked out the troops from view, and the flash was followed by blast winds and the noise of the explosion. Interviews with soldiers were conducted after the test.

>Following the test, the troops were trucked toward the stationary military equipment used for experiments. The experiments were set up one-half mile and also at three miles from the blast. At three miles, the gun emplacements and military vehicles were undamaged, but at on-half mile damage was moderate to heavy.

"No, that‚Äôs not voter suppression. Not any more than having to show an ID to get on a plane is suppressing someone‚Äôs right to interstate travel.
Or showing an ID to buy a gun is suppressing someone‚Äôs second amendment right. Or requiring a student to show an ID is suppressing their right to a free and appropriate education.
Your argument would not meet basic consistency comparison with a thousand other examples.
Being a person who has lawful status to cast a vote in this country necessarily means that it is lawful to verify whether someone is a person who has lawful status to cast a vote.

I know that you understand my arguments. How do I know? Because I know that if vote fraud tended to favor Republicans instead of Democrats, you would be pounding down the doors to make ID mandatory.

"We moved to Summerlin just less than 5 years ago. We specifically chose one of the most expensive subdivision due to the brand new elementary school that was just opening. The Principal was the #1 Principal for CCSD for many years and he hand picked all the teachers to bring with him to the new school. We were excited to be part of the brand new school with the best admin and teachers. Our son started kindergarten in the very first year and everything was great. Now he‚Äôs in the 4th grade and I can‚Äôt say the same. Some of the biggest issues you‚Äôll find with CCSD is the classroom sizes and lack of good teachers. My son has 34 kids in his 4th grade class. It was mostly online learning in 3rd grade, but he had 28 kids in that class. 5th graders are pushing 40 kids. That‚Äôs a lot of kids per teacher for an elementary school. 

Last year was a one off due to the pandemic and online learning. But 4th grade has been a huge challenge so far. My son isn‚Äôt learning as much as he could be due to the classroom size. I‚Äôm finding myself teaching my son the entire material because he‚Äôs not learning it in class. Luckily, I work from home, but he likes doing his homework before dinner because he loses focus after dinner and it‚Äôs hard to stop working my business for 1-2 hours to teach him math. 

My sister‚Äôs a Principal in a different state that also ranks very low in education and when I tell her about these issues, she can‚Äôt believe how bad it is here, especially for my school that‚Äôs brand new with the best of the best. 

Yes, constant budget cuts are making it extremely difficult to provide the resources for our kids, but our school can raise money like there‚Äôs no tomorrow. A few year ago, our school had announced on Friday that they have to raise $53k in less than 10 days due to budget cuts. If they couldn‚Äôt raise the full amount, he would have to cut a few teachers. He had over $100k in donations. What baffled me though was that last year when we had 100% online learning, we had 4 PE teachers. Like WTF!?!?!?

"I often find that people say they want to move to Henderson because they are looking for a small town/suburban feel. Usually they saw Henderson listed on some roundup of best small towns next to larger cities. Or they just don‚Äôt want to say they live in Las Vegas. 

While you will find that different neighborhoods and different master plans provide various lifestyle options that suit people in different ways, there is really no difference between Henderson and any other area in the Las Vegas metropolitan area.

There are for-profit private schools, nonprofit private schools,  religious schools, and charter schools in all areas across town.

"This is untrue and propaganda by the Bureau of Land Management and the local ranchers. They claim the horses cause ""destruction"" to the natural brush areas but the cows grazing on BLM land do not? It is really all about the ranchers who many have relatives working at BLM because there are many out of the way offices, wanting their cows to graze on the land and not the horses because they won't make money on the horses grazing. The BLM has been rounding up and selling horses for ""adoption"" but it has been investigated and these same ranchers are adopting the horses and sending them to Mexico for slaughter and being paid for the horse meat as well as an adoption fee from the BLM. It is a terrible situation. I agree they need to begin birth control measures on the horse and burro program but there is no mention of birth control for the cows that make money for the ranchers.

"The sun should be overhead at noon. Time should be symmetrical around the solar cycle in the sky. This seems manifestly obvious. 

It's extremely weird to move the numbers to temporarily trick people into going to work earlier.

Work hours will just move. People don't show up at 8 AM because there's something magical about the number 8. They show up because that's the earliest employers have found they can drag people into work.

Change it so 8 is now permanently 7 (by the sun) and employers will start the day at 9. Duh.

Edit:

Work hours in the US are largely determined by school bus schedules. About 70% of American workers have children under 18.

School bus schedules are based on how far before dawn parents will let their kids stand outside.

"One thing that‚Äôs very much worrying me is that nuclear power station in Ukraine, that had a fire‚Ä¶ first few days of March? Fire's out, repairs made but news reports past day or so have said that Russians have either broken the repair, or broken something else related to the plant. They‚Äôre literally playing with fire.
 
 
I could totally imagine: 
 
 
INT - DAY - PUTIN'S KREMLIN BUNKER
 
C.U. PUTIN'S rage-black face
 
                                       PUTIN
           ""If *I* can‚Äôt have you, Ukraine, nobody will!"" 
 
(Maniacal Laugh O.S.)
 
PUTIN calls the silo. He gives the order to launch missiles toward the Zaporizhzhia nuclear facility in Ukraine. 
 
EXT - MIDDAY - ZAPORIZHZHIA
 
A missile arcs in the sky, straight toward the plant. The ensuing explosion triggers the blast that instantly incinerates everyone and everything within the first few miles, blinds those farther away. The cloud rises and buildings begin to crumble. The effect is felt for hundreds of miles. Radiation begins to spread its misery. PUTIN revels. 
 
INT - NIGHT- PUTIN'S CONFERENCE ROOM
 
A feast to die for covers the long marble table. A half-dozen comrades cluster around the food. One man pumps PUTIN'S hand in congratulations, while the rest share silent glances. CONSPIRATOR 1 moves easily toward PUTIN, smiling. He nods at CONSPIRATOR 2, the man shaking PUTIN'S hand, who suddenly wrenches their leader's arm behind him. The other men quickly move in as Conspirator 1 shoves a long narrow knife between PUTIN'S ribs.
 
FADE TO BLACK
