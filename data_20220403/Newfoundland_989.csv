"Swiss Chalet isn't a bad restaurant, but it isn't special. It's very average. I eat there MAYBE once a year and I usually get the Ribs, but they are far removed from the best I have ever had. Best Ribs I ever had in this city was Fog City in the Avalon Mall. Damn they were so good.

The last few years, my favorite, go to spot has been Sun Sushi. I love that place. The complementary soup before the meal, the friendly staff and nice atmosphere make for a nice time out. The prices are right and the menu is LOADED with solid choices. I personally love the Sweet Potato Tempura to start off with, and move on to Orange Chicken as my main.

As for my worst? I'm hard pressed to recall any place I have been RECENTLY that has drawn my disdain, HOWEVER.. Roughly 8 years ago, there was a spot in Holyrood that I remember both my wife and I leaving with just utter disappointment. Been so long I had to look up the name, and it was Beach Cottage Restaurant. I'm nearly 100% certain it's gone now, but the food was just bland and unenjoyable, the dining experience amounted to just tables and chairs in a room with little flair, and the staff were nice, but seemed as if they were doing the bare minimum. The spot was in an older looking home, not far from the little pond is across from the beach. Prices were iffy but close to other places of similar offering.",t2_16cbm1,greyfoggydaynl,0,1649003189.0,0,t1_i38mazl,i38mazl,True,DhaemonX,t3_tvbhme,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/tvbhme/bestworst_restaurant_on_the_avalon_when_it_comes/,Best/Worst restaurant on the Avalon when it comes to cost/quality/quantity,/r/newfoundland/comments/tvbhme/bestworst_restaurant_on_the_avalon_when_it_comes/i38mazl/,1,r/newfoundland,0,1

"I work in insurance. From that perspective a wood stove in a home is different than a shed. Homes are usually built with some sort of fire resistant elements, less likely to be left unattended, etc. a wood stove in a shed has a higher level of risk because frankly it’s more likely it will burn down. 

Some companies may start getting more picky about them though. So if you’re not within a certain distance from a fire station, burning more than a certain amount of wood, etc. we already have these rules in place but it wouldn’t shock me if it got stricter over what is considered acceptable risk.

"I feel the province is currently better positioned to attract people and business start-ups than anywhere else in the country.

I could have moved anywhere and I moved here because the housing numbers make way more sense than anywhere else and I looked everywhere - I mean everywhere - ever heard of Manitouwadge?

Heres how I think it plays out - other Canadians flush with insane housing cash move mainly from Ontario to the St Johns area - (there was someone in here recently asking if $600k would be enough to find a nice house here?)

Prices in town will go through the roof as those in their 30s and 40s across Canada who bought houses for $250k that are now worth a million plus cash out and head this way...which then leads locals to cashing out their newfound Mount Pearl / Paradise / CBS / Torbay housing wealth and leaving town - taking the money they have made selling their place and heading to smaller cities and places outside of town / off the Avalon...

I bet that not only will the Avalon see crazy changes - but I reckon places like Clarenville and Bonavista are totally different within a decade because of this ripple effect.

Keep an eye on things - things are changing - just look at how many posts we get here on a more or less weekly basis now with people talking about moving here. Look at the recent numbers in the real estate world.

Gentrification has started and once it really gets rolling the next couple years - you aren't going to recognize many places as they are today.

There is a wave of Southern Ontario housing millionaires and so called ""investors"" on the way here - the next few years are going to be quite different than the past trends - its already started.

The country wide housing crisis is changing everything - everywhere - right now.

Did you see that other post today about buying a house in harbour grace sight unseen? I recently bought a house and my agent was telling me he was selling tons of places sight unseen these days. He was overwhelmed by where things are at. He was doing showings on his iphone.

I predict massive gentrification in a bunch of areas of the island - How many years you reckon until one cant find anything in Rabbittown for less than a million? 

Not only will gentrification will bring the housing millionaires - but it will also bring those who are creative and think outside the box - it will bring those who want office space for their startups - it will bring craftsmen, and tradespeople, and chefs and hair stylists - and self employed professionals - doctors and teachers and professors that cant afford housing anywhere else in the country - it will bring artists and creatives - entrepreneurs and those with ambition. It will bring those flush with housing cash to attempt to start a local business - some will succeed.

It will bring anyone who works at a computer making 100K plus that is sick of having a landlord - anyone who works from home can now work from starlink anywhere on the island. They will spend their money at the aformentioned newly formed local businesses.

But it will also bring those bullshit investors that New Brunswick is dealing with right now - those numbered companies based in Ontario - that own 100s of properties - just jacking everyones rent because they can - once they buy up New Brunswick - we are next - its already happening...

Im expecting life to suck in a more general social unrest / supply chain issue / geopolitical / climate change reality kind of way over the upcoming years for everyone everywhere...thankfully we are surrounded by the ocean...

"A future where there are less people who are paying a lot more to stay and live in the province.

There are three structural issues facing the people of the province - a huge debt, a declining population and an unwillingness to make the necessary changes.

You only need to look at the recent MF loan guarantee to see the political mindset is not there to make the hard fiscal decisions. The thinking that we can borrow our way out of our fiscal challenges is why the province is in such a dire fiscal mess right now and why it will inevitably face bankruptcy soon.

This is not only a political mindset, most people of the province feel the same way. We also now seeing community protests regarding health care changes for a system that is undeniably broken and providing very poor outcomes yet the people want it to continue as is. The people of the province don't want things to change and that is a huge impediment to the future.

The declining population will eventually find the province facing a situation where there will simply not be enough working people to support those who are not working.  The province must have a tax base to support its people and that tax base grows smaller every year.

Back in 2017 the Harris Centre released a report that predicted the population will decrease by 40,000 people by 2036.  It predicted that a Historical Survival Model would peg the province’s population at 522,558.  Census 2021 shows the population decreased to 510, 550 in 2021.  This leaves me believing that the population decline will be significantly higher than the estimated 40,000 and will easily surpass 50,000.

As I said, less people paying significantly more to live in the province.",t2_h4c7n75n,formerpe,0,1648918070.0,0,t1_i34izh9,i34izh9,True,Newfiejudd,t3_tu2z2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/tu2z2w/wild_nl_prediction_for_our_future_anyone_have_any/,Wild NL prediction for our future - Anyone have any?,/r/newfoundland/comments/tu2z2w/wild_nl_prediction_for_our_future_anyone_have_any/i34izh9/,2,r/newfoundland,0,2

Fuck them in particular. The goddam free market is why the price is so fucking high.

It takes 6-12 months from well to pump so any actual issue wouldn't be real until then.

Wanna lower the prices? Nationalize the O&G companies and cut strategic resources out of the stock market.

If we had nationalized our strategic resources we could make the prices stable, but at the end of the day, we do not pay the actual future damage cost of any fossil fuels period.

Some of the most popular traditional foods in Newfoundland at this point in time, I think would include:

• Jigs dinner (this meal varies from home to home but most always includes root vegetables and salt meat).

• Toutons (almost always pan fried in butter)

• Cod au Gratin

• Fisn n Chips

• Fish Cakes 

• Horderves (Tiny weiner from a can, cheese, pickle, tiny onion on a toothpick)

• Fries, dressing, gravy (modernize it by adding cheese to make it a 'Newfie Poutine'

• Fish n Brewis

• Moose meat (moose stew, moose burgers etc.)

• Tea Buns

• Homemade White Bread

• Snowballs

"Or, hear me out, there's an optimistic approach:

1. Low housing costs mean young people can actually get in on the property ladder and buy a home. 
2. Remote work means people don't necessarily have to live in the same place as their office, so it's possible to work from here for jobs anywhere.
3. The tech industry allows jobs to be created without needing to move physical output, reducing our competitive disadvantage to the rest of the North American market.
4. Geopolitical turmoil makes our boring and consistent political climate a more appealing place for living and investing.
5. Global warming makes parts of the continent increasingly uninhabitable.
6. We have abundant freshwater resources and a low population. 
7. Rest of North America scrambles to replace coal and oil infrastructure, while also expanding production to meet the demands of the coming electric car era. Meanwhile, we generate more than enough electricity for ourselves, and can accommodate energy-heavy industries.
8. Natural resources in mining and oil become more palatable for development in the face of international tensions and high demand. 
9. Perhaps pie-in-the-sky, but Ottawa needs to create more clean hydro power, assumes development of Lower Churchill to service the Maritimes via the Maritime Link.

The Gros Morne Mountain hike is actually about 16km, although you could hike to the lookout below the mountain, which is about 8km return and a lovely walk.

There are some other options too- like Green Gardens, Baker's Brook, the lookout trail above the discover center etc.

Freshwater is a shit hole. Only second behind 107 Bay Bulls Road for the low quality of tenants. We always used to put people who don't belong anywhere else into Freshwater - unfortunately, it's also the only thing many good tenants and young families could afford. 

Mice, leaky walls, horrible plumbing and shitty resident managers combine to make nasty apartments. 
Id caution against renting at Killam. I found that the turnover in staff was great which led to crappy service for the tenants. 

As well, the resident managers are like prisoners. Killam provides housing but pays them pennies. If they quit, they are out of a house.

There is also Earles riding in Carboneer (an hour and a bit outside st John's) they do not do lessons, just a half hour group trail ride lead by staff, really nice ride but on the boring side for experienced riders, and they are seasonal so may not be operating this time of year.

On the west coast outside deer lake would be Cache Rapid Stables, nice place, nice people (disclaimer: friends with the owner).  Not sure what they are doing this time of the year, but they do lessons, trail riding, and once upon a time did overnight camp rides but I'd have to confirm that with Kev, I believe they no longer do that.

"Well yes, this is probably the problem some of us have.  Yeah, I can tell you our death rate is an order of magnitude higher than Ontario.  But I don't know just what that means besides the fact that a lot of people are dying.

It feels like that statement should mean more, but in the big scheme of things?  14 people (on average) die every day in this province.  Most of them pass without anyone outside of their family and friends noticing.  But every two or three days we get treated to hearing about the five to ten people who have died of covid.  Making sense of that data is tricky, even for people who know how to make sense of data.

I guess we have to trust that our leaders are consulting people who can make sense of that data (like Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Raman) and are following their advice.

"The problem with that is that the people in those homes get MISERABLE when the homes are locked down and they don't get to see their family. At 70 and 80 years old with limited or no mobility and health conditions that have them confined in care homes a lot of them don't care if they get sick and die from covid. They're ready for it if it happens and they just want the comfort of seeing their family and friends.  It's sad but it's the reality of what's going on.

My relatives in seniors homes and the others in there living with them have expressed the sentiment ""what's the point if i'm just sitting in here and can't see anyone or do anything? I just want to see my family.""

It's more nuance than just locking down. You can't just block people from seeing each other without severely affecting the mental health and quality of life of those people.

I would agree that nearly every province and country has largely “compromised” on the science to the point where this is no longer an effectively managed situation globally. the science for covid is new and quickly changing and to alter policy based on new science would probably be called “flip flopping” in gen pop. Additionally there’s quite a powerful anti-science misinformation lobby that has a foothold in almost every level of every government in Canada and globally and this isn’t some new covid phenomenon they’ve been prepping for this for years. Russia was running anti-vax misinformation campaigns on Canadian social media long before we ever knew what covid was.,t2_fm271run,Cramblin_duvet,0,1648738013.0,0,t1_i2uqfbj,i2uqfbj,False,Spunkronaut,t3_ts488i,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/ts488i/as_covid19_hospitalizations_and_deaths_spike_nl/,"As COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths spike, N.L. health minister says health-care system will be 'managed'",/r/newfoundland/comments/ts488i/as_covid19_hospitalizations_and_deaths_spike_nl/i2uqfbj/,2,r/newfoundland,0,2

Honestly I’m leaving the province soon (work from home so I can live anywhere) because I’m just getting too scared of the state of healthcare here.

"I don’t know if I would call it interference as much as people doing things that they think their leaders would like them to do without being explicitly told. It’s kind of a less aggressive form of plausible deniability in a way. But most people who have been in government for a while definitely know when they’re being told something without being explicitly being told. There were also a lot more very knowledgeable people who could technically have been considered to be “on the side of science” (and who had the purview and mandate to push back against the political pressure) around to counteract some of this stuff when the emergency was first declared but as time has gone on (and burnout has taken hold) that base of people advocating for science informed policy has dissipated and without them not everyone might feel as though they have the power or backing to go against what they think are the wishes of the public for this all to “be declared over” even if it’s not over.

"They report new cases from PCR three times a week. The problem with the “current active cases” is it was just a guess based on the assumption that a positive case is active for ~7 days after the test. The numbers were therefore losing their value. Also with most people doing rapid tests now the total number is under reported because people who test positive with a rapid test or family members of those positive cases who are assumed to be positive themselves don’t let the government know.

Because of all of that the daily reported active cases was no longer worth reporting because it is way lower than the actual number.

Hospitalisation and death is still possible to get accurate numbers for and those are the ones being listed on the dashboard.

"The license holders own the enterprise itself. They take on a lot of risk in owning the enterprise - high risk and high reward, but also possible high losses. The fishery can be feast or famine, but they can lose tens of thousands in gas, bait, supplies, etc, if they have a bad trip or even more (possibly much more) over a bad season. The protests are generally organized by the union and anyone can show up, so I have no idea what the overall demographics of attendees look like. I don’t know the mentality behind protesting the provincial fisheries minister besides trying to show how strongly they feel about quota decisions, in hopes that the info and attendance is relayed to federal counterparts. Protests used to take place at the DFO building in White hills, or move between there, FFAW, and Confederation Building. Given that the federal fisheries minister is in Ottawa and the DFO building is mostly empty during the current COVID outbreak with non-essential staff working from home, I would think it was felt that focusing on a more heavily populated building would have higher impact. But that’s speculation on my part. Price has nothing to do with DFO so if they’re protesting price, DFO can’t help or intervene either way. If the union and Association don’t agree on pricing and it goes to adjudication, the decision is binding.

"Son of a fisherman here, so obvious bias.

This has less to do with price, and more to do with concentration of power and resources within the fishery; prices are a side-effect and major indicator of the current power shift.

For the past few decades, Newfoundland and Labrador has protected itself from the former days of merchants and fisherman-serfs by having policies that protected fishermen and enabled them to have their own enterprises in an owner-operator agreement, selling in an open market to various independent seafood processors. This permitted living wages and self-employed fishermen who could be independent of processors, competition, and market based prices.

Less than a decade ago, Newfoundland had more than 20 individual processors. Now, through a series of mergers and buyouts, there are 5. These 5 have been entering secretive agreements with the fewer number of fishing enterprises left, essentially forming their own fleets.

Currently, prices are set by a pricing panel between government, the fisherman's union, and seafood processors. This years agreed upon 'price' has a major discrepancy with market prices in other areas and especially with the prices the processors are reselling for, so the fishermen are calling 'bullshit'. The fishermen are pointing out that below-market prices here in Newfoundland as compared to Nova Scotia only a small geographical region away is proof of collusion among the five remaining producers. The seafood producers are attempting to scuttle any attempt at renegotiation by simultaneously discrediting panel members, and by pointing out the original agreement by the fishermen with a panel based 'system'. Other claims by the processors that Newfoundland crab and crab from Nova Scotia are of different quality is essentially false and a distraction, because both provinces have varying qualities of crab depending on the time of catch, area (north vs south), etc. 

For an explanation that happened several years back in New England, watch the episode of Rotten on Netflix about Codfish, and the guy they called 'The Codfather' who executed essentially the same shadow fleet acquisition.

At the end of the day - it's an arguement over what kind of system we want. Independent fishermen with their own vessels and enterprises selling in an open market; or, fishermen who are just employees making low/minimum wages for a few larger fishing companies who own the entire chain from the vessel to processing.",t2_7l9x6,CodeNewfie,0,1648681620.0,0,t1_i2s117n,i2s117n,True,MikeFromLA2,t3_tshmu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/tshmu9/eili5_why_are_fishermen_and_the_ffaw_always/,EILI5: Why are fishermen and the FFAW always complaining?,/r/newfoundland/comments/tshmu9/eili5_why_are_fishermen_and_the_ffaw_always/i2s117n/,14,r/newfoundland,0,14

"Ok, so you ask some really great questions here.

There isn't much ""to gain"" by lower prices but that is the realities of the market. Newfoundlands crab is of poorer quality than most of the Maritimes. The crabs aren't as big and aren't as red in color so the price per pound is lower. 

We harvest a significant portion of the country's landings in crab, so I guess in some sense we ""make it up"". Some 29k/71k metric tonnes in the country. There are additional costs for transportation, like most products on the island, although those statistics would be much more difficult to find. 

Corporate concentration in Newfoundland's fish processing sector has gotten much more popular in recent years. Royal Greenland, Ocean Choice International and Barry Group process 75% of fish on the island and close to 85% of shellfish. It's less of the government taking on the risk and more of the processors taking on the risk. Yes, the price guarantee acts as a price floor. 


FFAW will always aim for the highest price possible because they're selling the raw materials and the Association for Seafood Producers will always aim to buy raw materials as cheap as possible because they are the processors/retailers.

"First off, FFAW are a union, so they’re always going to advocate for their members, who vote them in, and pay dues (their salaries). Can’t fault them for playing politics and complaining, though their tactics and language are sometimes iffy. The fishermen don’t always have a collective opinion but in general want to get as much money as they can. Some are concerned with keeping the fishery healthy and actually advocate for more conservative fishing quotas, while others just want to maximize what they can take in a given year and roll the dice that there’ll still be some fish to harvest next year. Prices are set by groups like the Association of Seafood Producers (who represent the fish processors). Often the price is set in agreement with the FFAW, though sometimes they can’t come to an agreement and it goes to an adjudicator to decide. DFO has a bunch of different groups that work together on separate parts of assessing the fishery and setting quotas.  DFO Science does fishing surveys, and uses that data plus data from the fishery itself, to crunch all the numbers on different fisheries based on depth, area, variables like age classes (ex. if there are cod, are they all one age?). They compare numbers to past years, and model what things might look like in the future. This info is presented to science peers and industry partners, feedback is gathered, and a separate group at DFO called Fish Management integrate the numbers plus feedback plus socioeconomic factors into an overall decision about quotas. In general the quota should maximize how much fisherpeople can take from the environment while leaving enough of a species behind to keep the population stable. As you can imagine, it’s a very delicate balance, and DFO can’t please everyone given the factors at play. The province could place political pressure on the fisheries minister but ultimately have no official role in setting quotas. Fish harvesters can make millions depending on their quota and the fishery in question, though deckhands make significantly less than vessel/quota owners. Many folks who own their own vessel make millions every year. The fishery is a really intense subject in NL, it’s really emotional for people involved in it, and even for those who aren’t involved but have a connection to it. The cod moratorium was 30 years ago but still looms large over many things, and still often leads the conversation surrounding DFO. I work on and am connected to the science side of things, but come from and married into a fishing family. I can’t speak for anyone but myself and what I’ve seen and experienced, which is that scientists put years of their lives into trying to keep the fishery going, to stop people from removing too much so that what happened to cod doesn’t happen to any other species. It can be thankless work to be told you’re full of s**t and deliberately trying to screw honest people over. It’s become part and parcel of the work though, especially when rhetoric and politics are brought into conversations about fisheries science.",t2_5cfmxdqz,ophiopholis,0,1648677137.0,0,t1_i2rqupe,i2rqupe,True,MikeFromLA2,t3_tshmu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/tshmu9/eili5_why_are_fishermen_and_the_ffaw_always/,EILI5: Why are fishermen and the FFAW always complaining?,/r/newfoundland/comments/tshmu9/eili5_why_are_fishermen_and_the_ffaw_always/i2rqupe/,22,r/newfoundland,0,22

They seem like unicorns. It's hard now to imagine the ignorance and hatred that existed then. I mean, the AIDs stigma was still very alive and widely associated with homosexuality (in a very negative way) in the late 90s/2000s where I grew up, rural/bay community...it was scary. I didn't want to ""end up"" like *that*. You didn't want to even know anyone like that. I internalized a lot of homophobia in that way, before I even knew I was gay. It took me nearly 5 years from the time I knew my sexuality until I could actually make peace with it in my own head. It was seriously that horrifying of a concept, and largely because of how it seemed like gay = AIDS = undignified death. So I really wish I had seen this documentary as a kid. Homophobes really weaponized AIDS, and I'm sure they still do - this documentary is the antidote to that.

Ray was loved unconditionally by his society for the person he is, til the bitter end. The AIDs was irrelevant, much like being gay was irrelevant, it didn't make him any less to those around him. And Ray himself, as you'll see in the doc, is such a loveable man and role model. Its easy to see why so many tears are shed for him in the doc itself. Ray had a hugely compassionate heart, and it showed.

This documentary speaks to the power that lives in vulnerability, unconditional love and acceptance. We need this now more than ever.

And its a painfully universal experience that's documented as well, as we see Ray/his family come to terms with his failing health and mortality. We might not all die in this exact way, but we will all decline and lose our capacities to some extent before the end. We don't talk about this much in our culture openly, so it's probably healthy to see a depiction and think about it every now and then. 

Lastly, although AIDS-related homophobia is close to home, it never really ""hit"" me that AIDS was an actual thing here in NL until seeing this documentary (as a person who was born after the AIDS crisis). Its such an invisible illness, and so much media on AIDS is placed in America or some other mainland place (yes, I did also miss the timeframe for Codco and Tommy Sexton). So this documentary, with all of its local colour (the thick Southern Shore accent is unmistakable), really places AIDS here in this place in an undeniable way",t2_7vxm8,Nathanull,0,1648666974.0,0,t1_i2r1d60,i2r1d60,True,bubblesses,t3_ts3laf,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/ts3laf/the_death_of_ray_condon_a_nl_hero_who/,The Death of Ray Condon : A NL Hero who destigmatized HIV and AIDS in the '90s,/r/newfoundland/comments/ts3laf/the_death_of_ray_condon_a_nl_hero_who/i2r1d60/,17,r/newfoundland,0,17

"Well here's the thing.  He should have lied through his teeth.

The trouble with paying a ransom is that you get known as an ""easy mark"" in the future, so instead of getting swept up in some kind of scan, you get specifically targeted because they know you'll pay.

This is the rub:  If you didn't pay the ransom, you'd shout it from the rooftops because then it has the opposite effect.   The ransomware gangs know you won't capitulate and have probably put in mitigation efforts so you're not worth the trouble.

If you stonewall like that then it's tacitly admitting you paid the ransom.  The hackers aren't stupid.

Regardless, clamming up means there's no impetus to improve your environment or fix the problems.  The next time this happens they'll say ""we did everything we were told to do"" and blame it on others without actually detailing what it is they did.    These sorts of things \*should\* be scrutinized because that's how you improve.

Government (and our government in particular) is a classic example of a compliance based organization.  Nobody wants to stick their neck out, so they find some standard to comply with, check all the boxes and when bad things happen, they point at the standard and say ""we were fully compliant"".

"It's not semantics.

The difference is sufficiently important that Ontario changed from reporting them combined to creating separate categories.

They changed hospitalization reporting back in January, and changed death reporting recently.

Its not standardized between provinces, and given that it's been an issue in other provinces, it's not at all unreasonable to ask the question.

The general consensus here is the covid numbers reported publically in Newfoundland and Labrador has alway been ""from"" and they don't report the ""with"" numbers.

No one seems to have a reference one way or another, though someone mentioned it was by John Haggie verbally in a briefing that the ""with"" count was much higher.

If you don't like people discussing news and events, you may be in the wrong place.

">VOCM is reporting today that case counts per 100,000 are 5 times higher in NL & Lab than in ON. Scary stat when you consider how few people are actually being tested right now.

Respectfully, I disagree with that being a scary stat. With our high vaccination rate, one of the highest in the world, case counts no longer matter. Deaths are the important number. We also need to consider how many people in Ontario have gotten Covid in the past and have some natural immunity versus the number of people that's true for in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL).

People in NL were so well shielded from Covid for the past two years that there was a very small amount of immunity gained from people catching it, but thankfully we used that time wisely and were able to achieve one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. Those efforts are now paying off, as the vast majority of people who catch it have very mild, if any, symptoms thanks to the vaccines, and typically people who get it are able to go back to normal after several days, while also being much less at risk for long-Covid.

At a certain point we, as residents of NL, need to get to a place where we live with Covid, the same way we've learned to live with influenza and other diseases. People's mental health have suffered due to the lock-downs/restrictions, and we're only now beginning to see the effects of all the canceled/delayed medical procedures, also less importantly, there's also the economic considerations.

VOCM is reporting today that case counts per 100,000 are 5 times higher in NL & Lab than in ON.  Scary stat when you consider how few people are actually being tested right now.

"The difference between ""with"" and ""from"" isn't semantics, it's huge.

The maximum number of ""with"" cases is equal to the maximum number of people usually in the hospital.

If every case hospitalized was ""with"" then covid hospitalizations would be totally irrelevant.

""From"" cases add to the total number beyond ""normal"" and are the extra load on the system.

I have no idea how Newfoundland and Labrador reports them, but my understanding was the published number was ""from"" cases, I can't find a reference for that now though.

I know Ontario went from reporting ""covid"" cases combined to separating them into ""with"" and ""from"" back the end of December and their covid cases plummeted.

If someone is in the hospital with a broken femur and a no-symptom case of covid, covid didn't put them in the hospital.

Edit: found an article from cbc  on March 9, Dr. Fitzgerald was quoted saying she figured the health care system could handle 40-60 hospitalizations, hard to judge depending on what care each case could handle.

I have 3 kids and manage to game just fine in the evenings. Which is where my bitching comes into play. My pass time after I’ve spent and entire day taking care of my family doesn’t begin for another 3-4 hours.

So as an independent fact checker I want to take some time to bust some myths you just created about me.

1. If 30 is an old man then so be it, I accept my fate
2. Rocking a Google Pixel 3xl right now... It's done me well the past few years but the battery is starting to deplete faster than I'd like so it's soon time to upgrade to a 6 I'm thinking
3. I actually enjoy gaming somewhat myself when I have the time between working and parenting. Just finished Fallout New Vegas, casually play Diablo 2 Resurrected, starting to get in to flight simming now. You and I aren't so different, you just bitch more and can't accept your own constraints. I used to game a shitload until I finished college and I didn't have the time anymore because of life responsibilities. When you decide to have kids you have to put this stuff on the back burner.

Ahh yes. The opinion of an old man who’s only experience with the vast array of gaming is playing *wordscapes* on his iPhone SE wearing glasses off his nose 1 fingering the screen. Yes.

Pouch Cove has basically nothing when it comes to amenities. You should set your expectations at rock bottom and count on most things coming from St Johns.

There's 2 small convenience stores(3 if you count the Drug Store) no gas station, 1 restaurant, little to no organised youth programs or activities, one K-6 school.

Anything you need to buy outside of basic food commodities and snacks will be bought in St Johns/the Foodland in Torbay(15-20ish minutes one way) 

Any leagues or sports will likely be in St.Johns as well (they might still do a summer soccer league in Flatrock? When I was growing up we had a T-Ball/Softball league)

All that being said, I noticed in an earlier comment you mentioned you were coming from Cape Breton. If you're already used to the small town life, it won't be too much of a shock. 

I dearly miss home and I wouldn't trade my upbringing for the world but I was born into it. 

Lasty, I've seen people have problems with the ""clicky"" nature of back home. I obviously haven't experienced it as someone from there but I could see how its a thing. Pouch Cove is an old town with a handful of family names that have been there since the beginning. In fact, there was a genealogy project in the early 90's that surmised that everyone whos family originated from the Cove was related either by blood or marriage to the Sullivan family.

All that is to say, while people will undoubtedly be friendly towards you, it might take a long time for them to see you as someone other than ""the new people""

Phew, that went longer than I intended, but I think it'll provide from valuable insight.",t2_5b6ff,XPhazeX,0,1648511394.0,0,t1_i2i2l1e,i2i2l1e,False,Mediocre_Rhubarb97,t3_tq2mbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/comments/tq2mbg/building_in_rural_pouch_cove_area_question/,Building in rural pouch cove area question,/r/newfoundland/comments/tq2mbg/building_in_rural_pouch_cove_area_question/i2i2l1e/,1,r/newfoundland,0,1

You can call the town but as far as I know there is no inspections in pouch cove. If it’s like other small municipalities the electrician will inspect their own work if they are certified and forward it to NL power for hookup. The town will also likely need a location report from a surveyor after your footing is poured in order to get the full go ahead on construction.

"Thank you so much for this information. 

My wife and I and my in-laws live in calgary now,  but are in StJohns July 28-Aug 11 for our 10th wedding anniversary and my in-laws 50th(!) and are going crazy trying to nail down a rental . Our bad of course for not booking this in advance , but a family member has some health issues so planning this was time challenged. 

I hope I’m not this breaking rules of this subreddit  but we would be happy to pay $2500 for a 11day rental if anyone has a car available. Would need to see registration and insurance and would need my FIL included on the insurance and happy to discuss payment terms. 

We are respectable people with verifiable cred so the potential renter can have confidence that we are not scammers. 

DM me pls if interested and we can arrange a phone call
