"There are some places that only increase your property tax when a house is sold/bought by a new person. This causes other issues that are just as bad.

"thank you for the breakdown. im not a finance person but i will explain my ""idea"" the best way i can. we can have a threshold of a minimum amount for those that make 0 income based on their previous income. sort of like retirement where your best 20 yrs(im not too sure about this number but the concept is the same)are being recorded. that would cover ""older ppl"" that cant work because of age. no one older should be working because health is suddenly a huge consideration hence retirement existing. there is always a way to verify income, suppose when you buy a property you have to report income prior to buying,the same manner when renting and landlords ask for paystubs. from those paystubs we can verify income. someone made a point where it doesnt make sense to have little to no income yet buy a fancy car or spend a huge amount. the irs would have to audit and maybe a system could be developed where assets must be listed prior to buying property as well. if you have 0 income one of 3 options occur...

1. total assets you own and using a fixed equation we could calculate a tax amount for that to substitute the income based tax

2. you dont work at all because you are retired thus an equation used similarly to calculating retirement payout

3.you cant buy because you dont own assets,have no job thus negating everything

there is always a way to verify income. its just the necessary protocols must be established to pick any holes as the ones you listed. of course there are probably more optimal methods as im not a finance consultant but im sure something can be created using top tier consultants so we establish a policy that is fair for everyone and not limiting low income families from buying or staying in a certain area",t2_evbkm,romanssworld,0,1647909260.0,0,t1_i1loodj,i1loodj,False,romanssworld,t3_tje6av,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/,Property tax constantly increasing....,/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/i1loodj/,1,r/Naperville,0,1
"it already doesnt work for income tax so I can't see it working for property tax. Think if someones net worth was based off unrealized stock options, and they leveraged that for a loan (very common with wealthy). The loan is 0% income, so now you have a tax rate based on 0.

Or what if you transferred ownership of the house to a spouse that did not work, again, a tax rate of 0. But lets say you cover that and say hey, its income based on residents that list it as a primary residence. Well ok, I will list my primary residence on my vacation home in another state, not I am only being taxed flat income in IL and nothing else.

You now have to somehow pay a agency you will have to create to verify I spend a majority of my days at that house.

What would you do if people that lived in other states bought up the land as investment, because you have no idea how much they make because they dont work in IL so all that is taxed at 0, and they will just sit on the property because it costs them nothing and then sell it.

"Yes, if all the houses on your block suddenly sold for 1.25, 1.23, 1.27, 1.26 then your house would be 'worth' 1.25 now. That's assuming it's around the same size and condition as the other houses.

Any that are not efficient will then be appealed through a lawyer.

I don't agree on your income idea. Our country already does a terrible job taxing the rich, this would be another avenue for them. If we tax on their income, now you can have a hedge fund manager in downtown Naperville paying a $1 in property taxes because all of his profits are sent to reinsurers offshore to Bermuda and his income is 'only' $35K/year.

"In your hypothetical, I believe the IRS would like to have a word with them.

But in any case, the fair value is tied to the actual value of the house if it was sold.  One way to possibly reduce your taxes is to hire a property tax attorney (you actually can do this yourself, and it isn't hard, but I've never personally done it, but my cousin has).

Of course, what is ""fair"" is very subjective.  How would you feel if Mr McScrooge came in and bought all the houses around you, and then held them for 30 years?  If the fair value didn't reflect the actual value of the house, then Mr. McScrooge would be paying taxes on the price he bought the houses at 30 years ago, which would quite likely be considerably less.

"Why is the land worth $10k? Who made up the $10k number, OP? Do you think it's some national price list -> 1 acre = $10k? Because it's not. 1 acre of land in California is worth much more than an acre of the same land in Arkansas. Why?

All value is tied to market, for ALL products, not just houses. This is because America is a pseudo ""free market"" which means there is limited government regulation. (I say pseudo for reasons outside the scope of this basic economics convo).

Supply and demand dictate generally what the value is. There is no such thing as ""true"" value - who determines what true is, in a moving market? We don't live in a dictatorship where someone is setting prices for everyone, everywhere OP.

Why is an iphone worth $800? Why is a corporate stock worth $5 today and $35 tomorrow? Why is your dad's house now worth 3X what it used to be? All because of the same reason - someone is willing to pay that, so that is what it is worth.

The growth of the market value of housing is definitely an issue, partly because of - supply (governments are choosing not to subsidize building of affordable housing), partly because of - demand (not enough regulation on buyers, allowing too much foreign $ in for example), and partly because of- wages (people's incomes have not kept up with basic inflation, which means housing will ALWAYS be more and more unaffordable).

Why don't governments subsidize more affordable housing? Because usually, they directly benefit from higher taxes, higher property value, etc - it's more money for them. You can imagine that many cities would rather attract the Silicon Valley guy with $3m in his pocket to spend at the downtown shops than keep the janitor living there. And it sounds harsh and I'm sorry and I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but it's the reality. Your dad has less to offer the city of Naperville than the new guy who wants to bulldoze his house and build a new cookie-cutter $1m farmhouse on it.

Why aren't there any regulations to prevent people buying houses at ridiculous prices just as empty investment properties? Same point as above - more cash flow is almost always seen as good.

How do people like your dad make an impact? By voting differently, for governments that are aligned to their interests. And by demanding more salary for their work. Lack of government regulation in housing contributes directly to this bubble, but many people who are unfortunately in the demographic of your father seem to see ""more government regulation"" as an evil to be avoided.

Well, in the absence of government, the ""market"" gets to decide, and it decided your dad shouldn't live there anymore. The ""market"", especially the one in America, will always favor the rich.

"I agree with you for the most part. My issues to summarize are....

\-Value of house increasing depending on the market value of the houses around said house. 

\-Property tax not taking into account income

Income is a big issue but regardless of income not keeping up with inflation the value of the house increasing constantly is still a concern in the long run. I agree tax is a % and the amount paid obviously increases the more something is worth. The worth part aka fair cash value that increases everywhere DRASTICALLY is the big concern. Suppose you have a suburb with 5 houses that are worth 100k at first then after idk 30 years they are worth 600k and no renovations were done. Why would the market value increase exactly?

"The problem is wages, OP, and again not enough rules on who can buy.

Housing tax is tied to housing value. Just like sales tax is tied to sales value. It IS a fixed thing - it's a %. It ONLY goes up if the value goes up. If you buy a $50000 car, the tax is more than a $500 car. Isn't that fair? Tax brackets work the same - it's with INCOME right? More income = more tax!

It would only be unfair if your dad's house was worth the same. But it's NOT. The house is now worth more money, so your dad has to pay more tax - otherwise it becomes UNfair because he would be paying $500 worth of tax on something he owns which is actually worth $50000.

Your father should be asking to make more money. Income has not kept pace with inflation. This is the biggest issue of today which is leading to a huge disparity in income levels.

The issue isn't property tax OP. It is perfectly fair to have a flat %.

The problem is the VALUE of your father's house is gone beyond his INCOME. That is a problem with both your dad's income, and inflation of homes.

Again though, has NOTHING to do with the tax % resulting in higher taxes. That isn't the ""unfair"" part. You are looking at the wrong aspect completely.

"Thank you for your comment and maybe a better solution is for the property tax to be fixed rather than it be so flexible since it will always increase. I should have worded my description better,I did not mean NO young people but it is an issue for the average young person. For example, my brother(I know the sample size is stupid small but his case would be average according to the census) is a 28 yr old working for the state making 70k. He has his college debt which is ""normal"" but otherwise he budgets heavy. He wants to buy a house but cannot afford it in the Naperville area which is fine,Naperville isn't end all be all but the fact he is struggling to find a home in general outside of dupage county that fits his budget is worrisome since his pay is considered ""good"" by the average person. I use him as an example to say that I can imagine most people are struggling since the median income is 34,248.45 in the US. I understand owning a home  can be a Privelige but that is no reason for it to be unaffordable unless you work in silicon valley or other high end places that have crazy salaries. Denver is currently going through this scenario. A house shouldn’t increase so much depending on the value of sellers around them. I guess that is the term of market value and it is possible for other sellers to screw people over unintentionally.

But GIVEN that the land IS appreciating, is it fair for everyone to have to pay more tax to keep living there, including your elderly parents? Yes.  
 

This stands out to me,I do not think it is fair for everyone to pay more taxes to keep living in X area. I would argue and say most families work the same job for many years and their income doesn't increase at the same rate as the housing market does. The perfect example I would say is ""normal"" is that a family of 4 lives makes a combined income of 70k,basing off census medians, and suppose they lived in the area for 40 years. There is a good chance their income did not go up as quick as the value of the house if we examine housing values from now to 40 yrs ago. It would be ""more"" fair to have the value of the house go up but not the tax,the property tax should take into account income to take into considerations of the household. So now the person who makes 3m from Silicon valley can pay more but not the family thtat makes 70k a yr combined.

"This helps alot and aligns with their tool that I used. I just don't see it being reasonable that property tax keeps going up or rather that the fair cash value goes up without ""reason"". An example is my parents circle drive, one house is a old naperville house that looks like a dump and smaller than my parents place but yet worth more. The tool shows every year the cash value went up. Same with my parents,no rennovations were done but the cash value goes up without reason which in turn makes the amount paid in property tax higher. If it is going to go up in every place eventually the bubble will burst. My concern was more towards how the cash value is EXACTLY calculated.

""They determine what the house is worth if sold this year, that is your ""Fair Cash Value"". This is based on a number of factors including size of the house, the number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, and what similar houses around you have sold for in the recent past (12 months I think?)./""  


This stands out to me,I agree with more fixed variables such as size of the house and its room amount. What is sketchy to me is that the cash value is also hugely dependent on have similar houses have sold to. This means some families can be displaced out of their area if other houses have sold for alot. I thought the cash value was more fixed on a set equation that is for the house rather than having such a variable factor considered in it. I do wonder suppose you had 4 families and they all sold the house to each other for 1 dollar or a million dollars then they all bought their original house back for a dollar or million dollars, then the cash value would change drastically based on that for other families around the house. You can control the cash value if it was purely dependent on renovations or amount of rooms but the other variable makes it concerning. I do not think it is fair for many people in this country.

But GIVEN that the land IS appreciating, is it fair for everyone to have to pay more tax to keep living there, including your elderly parents? Yes. 

Your parents’ house is literally worth more today. That’s why they pay more tax. Why would it not be dependent on the value today?

The elderly are priced out of homes all the time in “popular” areas because younger people have more money to spend. 

And it’s not true either that NO young people can afford it. The issue is the reverse. There’s too many investors and people buying property now. It’s driving prices sky high because there’s not enough regulations anywhere on who is allowed to buy.

">The real issue here is the sky-rocketing of home valuations and the bubble it’s creating. But that is a far bigger and broader issue.

This is my concern. Why are values of houses going up if the house has not gone through any renovations? For example in my parents circle drive there is one house that has literally been through a fire and it was ""built"" again but its alot smaller and worth more. Another house is a dump(exaggeration but it is super old and falling apart) and the value of the house is worth more than my parents house yet being smaller and older. I looked up the house in the property tax tool and the historical prices are crazy how much its increased in past 5 years. I understand gentrification but its going to get at a point where housing wont be affordable for anyone.

&#x200B;

My main question is why is the value increasing? I assumed housing increased in value when renovations are done. I suppose there is a ""true"" value of a house and the ""market value"". The true value is lets say I have a piece of land and built a cabin that costs 10k. The market value would be different based on the fair cash value that is  created by houses that are sold for X price nearby. The fact the market value and true value are so different and increasing and stupid rates is rather worrisome. Sure for sellers such as developers that is great but for the average home buyer I do not think is is a good thing considering this is happening EVERYWHERE. I apologize for the ignorance and I appreciate the intel.",t2_evbkm,romanssworld,0,1647880456.0,0,t1_i1jqnby,i1jqnby,False,romanssworld,t3_tje6av,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/,Property tax constantly increasing....,/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/i1jqnby/,-2,r/Naperville,0,-2
"This is how property taxes work here in DuPage:

They determine what the house is worth if sold this year, that is your ""Fair Cash Value"".  This is based on a number of factors including size of the house, the number of bedrooms/bathrooms, location, and what similar houses around you have sold for in the recent past (12 months I think?).

Then you take the ""Fair Cash Value"" and divide that by 3 (with some weird rounding).  That is the ""Assessed Value"".

Then you start with your deductions.  Subtract $6000 if the house is your primary residence (and sometimes not, legal excuses here).  Subtract (up to) $5000 if you are a senior.  Some other exemptions like if you are disabled, a veteran, or a senior with low income.

This then becomes your ""Net Taxable Value"".  You multiply the tax rate (currently 8.5869%) by your net taxable value and that is the amount you owe for property taxes.

How is the tax rate determined? Oh, that's easy.  The county taxes it's budget and divides it by the total of all the taxable property value in the county.  So as the budget goes up, the tax rate goes up.

So as long as property values go up, so do property taxes.  IF your father is over 65, and has an income of less than $65,000 a year (that probably includes social security, pensions, and withdraws from IRA/401(k)s or the similar accounts for government/education workers) then he can apply for a ""Senior Freeze"".  Just don't EVER make more than $65k, because you will lose it, the property tax will get frozen next year at the newer, higher rate.

Also, Illinois does not have a cap on property taxes like many other states, and we are currently the second worst state out of all 50 US states.  Also the largest reason why I am moving this year.  Sorry, but I can move somewhere else that houses are cheaper, property taxes are much lower, income taxes are lower, cost of living is lower, no more winters, and a fiscally responsible state budget.",t2_coktpu4,kingmotley,0,1647880022.0,0,t1_i1jpip3,i1jpip3,True,romanssworld,t3_tje6av,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/,Property tax constantly increasing....,/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/i1jpip3/,1,r/Naperville,0,1
"Ok I don’t understand your question. This is how it works everywhere. Property value is going up, everywhere. It’s a national trend, even global actually as countries like Canada are hit even worse than us in the states. The demand for housing is skyrocketing, and the prices for housing is actually being met - people (and developers) are actually buying houses at those sky high prices. Which is why they don’t go down. 

This is why gentrification is a thing. Yes, people DO get priced out of their own homes they’ve lived in for years. That’s literally the “point” of gentrification - for new people to rebuild an area. I am not saying I agree or don’t agree morally with this either, but it’s what happens when areas shift demographically. And it only happens in “attractive” areas - eg Detroit is still a cheap wasteland because no one new is even wanting to go there. 

Obviously Naperville is not Oakland California or East Nashville but the concept is the same.

Home values go up. Property tax goes up to match the fact your home and land is now worth more. Some people are priced out of their homes. New people come in from other places, either as investors or as transplants from more expensive areas. 

“Why” does it increase for everyone? Because it’s even more unfair the other way around - why WOULDN’T everyone have to pay more, if the entire area has gone up in value? The neighborhood has become more attractive, so everyone needs to pay more to keep living there.  And if one person doesn’t want to pay anymore that’s fine - someone else will come in and live there, because the demand is high, again because the area is attractive to an audience that can now afford a certain higher amount. 

If your parents sold your house today, it’s worth much more than what it used to be 40 yrs ago. So they pay tax of the worth today. Otherwise they’re getting a helluva bargain for no reason except because they bought early, which also doesn’t make sense because it’s not like the neighborhood and demographics are staying the same for 40 yrs. 

The real issue here is the sky-rocketing of home valuations and the bubble it’s creating. But that is a far bigger and broader issue. 

Your parents probably do qualify for some other deductions, and they can always appeal their assessment.",t2_qxjiact,Surfercatgotnolegs,0,1647879752.0,0,t1_i1jotbq,i1jotbq,False,romanssworld,t3_tje6av,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/,Property tax constantly increasing....,/r/Naperville/comments/tje6av/property_tax_constantly_increasing/i1jotbq/,9,r/Naperville,0,9

"Thank you for details! The way I saw the breakdown in dupage county was a specific tax rate which is independent on value of the home, what concerned me is how the value of the home is even determined. The variables the link uses is building value, fair cash value,and land value.

"It's still cold out right now so the guys and girls waiting outside to ride along for the tests will be wearing several layers. This is to your advantage. You must turn the cars heat on full power, everything you can. This also means heated seats if you have them, and at max temperature. The goal here is to make the test instructor uncomfortably warm. So warm that they will need to roll down their window to cool off. Upon seeing that you know how to drive around safely in a neighborhood, the test will be cut short because the heat will have become unbearable (they won't admit that is why), and you will pass with flying colors.

The other place I went to is in downtown Wheaton, called Mai Thai and I think it's exclusively take-out right now. Also really solid. Both were highly recommended to me and didn't disappoint.

"Check out licensed in-home day care in DuPage County. Here’s a link: https://childcarecenter.us/illinois_homecare/du_page_il_county

Licensed in-home day care providers have regular visits from the overseeing county department, like corporate care centers; must provide a balanced curriculum, meal plan and activity plan, like corporate providers; and are small businesses, essentially. Someone who takes the time to get a licensed operating day care in their home is someone who wants to take good care of children. Sometimes they’ll have pets (that is allowed), if you are interested in that.

I used a licensed at-home provider for my kids, who are now in their mid-twenties, so it was a while ago. She took one sick day in five years of using her, she had a separate space from her home for the kids, she had a great curriculum, and she helped potty train my kids and worked with me to teach them to feed and dress themselves, and self-regulate (she was great with social/emotional stuff, way ahead of her time). She was incredible—they called her Nanny. It was a superb experience with child care.

"I always wondered what peoples thoughts were on ribfest moving. What’s this subs opinion on it? I actually worked at the park district during their last event and it was really bittersweet. I’m going to miss working the event and being able to see all the setup taking place. Whenever the stages starting going up it reminded me that ribfest was starting soon and it was going to be a fun time at work. 

I personally see how the move is a good thing since they said there’s more space which will allow for a “beefier” ribfest (or so they say). And will overall just be easier for people. I am a bit sad however to see that this isn’t a Naperville event anymore and it’s in Wheaton but if this will truly be better for the event and for people then That’s what matters.

"For 203 there is no formal foreign language instruction in Elementary, though as you reference some schools may partner with a local business to offer an after school Foreign Language program. This may even vary year to year depending on demand, parent involvement, and local business availability. If I remember right they did a “language ladder” program when my daughter was in Elementary, but due to lack of interest it was canceled and not offered on subsequent years.

In Middle School it is offered as an elective for 7th and 8th grade for students interested. Spanish, French, and German of offered. If your student elects to take foreign language this way in middle school, they will go straight into Level 2 in High School of whatever language they chose allowing them to potentially take the level 5 course (might be AP, not sure) as a senior.

In High School it’s offered as a standard elective. I don’t believe any foreign language classes are required to graduate, but two years is typically required for college admission.

"Just want to point out I was one of those high schoolers who taught preschool, 99% of the teens in that class love kids and want to be there with them, we played and taught quite a bit, in fact the main issue was ‘spoiling the kids’ giving them stickers or something like that because if you brought one for the kid you were responsible for, not all the kids would get one. The lesson plan was taught by the teacher of the class to the teenagers then taught from the teens to the kids. It was highly structured and everyone had fun. Also those types of preschools are usually 1 on 1 they pair each kid with a teen to help and teach. The actual class teacher was always in the room so it wasn’t just a bunch of teenagers alone with a ton of kids. I definitely recommend at least checking it out. Yeah the park district teachers are paid, but that class is an elective. So only teenagers who actually enjoy being around children sign up for it. I went to Plainfield south and that wasn’t even an option to us til junior year, plus you had to do the required child development classes for both prior years. By then it usually weeds out the teens taking it as a blow off class.

Quick edit to add: I know I said 99% of teens want to be there. The only reason I said that is because I very vividly remember one girl saying she didn’t want to be a teacher but a pediatrician and the child development class that it was, was informative and she figured would help in the long run. She wasn’t mean or anything like that. The preschool was only there 3 days a week I believe and the other days were learning the lesson plan and the ways it helped develop different areas for the children.",t2_6q07t,Montauk26,0,1645502435.0,0,t1_hxx8uxj,hxx8uxj,False,kellysaidso,t3_sy4hlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naperville/comments/sy4hlg/moving_to_naperville/,Moving to Naperville,/r/Naperville/comments/sy4hlg/moving_to_naperville/hxx8uxj/,1,r/Naperville,0,1

"This was at Seager. The teachers just stood around half the time. No lesson plans from what I could tell. I saw one push my daughter away when she asked for help putting on her coat and backpack. The parents would stand in the area by the bathrooms at pickup time and I could see the interaction. 

On one day, they said they heard my daughter say a ""naughty"" word while everyone was in line. So we had a little meeting with the director and the teachers. It felt like I was in trouble the way it was conducted. They decided to have the teacher assistant follow our daughter around with a notebook every day and report what goes on. The assistant said to us this was insane, our girl is incredible, and the notebook was full of positive things. 

On my daughter's birthday, my wife could come to class and read a book. She saw the one teacher cleaning the tables with the same dust mop that she just used to clean the floor. As if 3-5 year olds will have self-restraint to not eat food that falls onto the table. They made eye contact and the teacher went immediately to the back room to put the dust mop away. 

The pandemic hit, so we didn't even bother searching for a preschool for our second daughter. We looked around a few months ago to do half a year, and I saw a similar program at Naperville Central that had the high school kids. But my wife didn't trust teenagers to do any better than paid park district employees. Every other place was full, even the D203 preschool on Naper.

The educators and the quality of the education here in Naperville is something that I found significant by comparison. I know everyone’s experience varies, but I tip my hat to how well my kid has done this year on both his personal growth and educational goals. Same for my youngest in daycare.

Prices used to be very reasonable, but it's been a few years since I've ridden the train, so if that's changed I'm not aware. Trains usually arrive every hour, with trains arriving faster during ""peak"" hours (mornings and afternoons during what would otherwise be ""Rush Hour"" traffic) and slower on weekends.

I used to use it all the time to get in and out of the city as a bridge to the Amtrak line that took me to college, which allowed me to return home for long weekends/holidays to visit family.

Driving to Chicago can be 35 mins (rare) 50-60 mins (standard) 90+ mins (rush hours) Good luck, Naperville is great. If you use the train a lot you might want to live on the North side (N of 75th ST).",t2_4hy3w,tonyh505,0,1643948520.0,0,t1_hviq2zb,hviq2zb,True,Elegant-Quail-6461,t3_sk3h0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Naperville/comments/sk3h0y/transport_options_from_naperville_to_downtown/,Transport options from Naperville to Downtown Chicago area (potentially living in Naperville soon),/r/Naperville/comments/sk3h0y/transport_options_from_naperville_to_downtown/hviq2zb/,4,r/Naperville,0,4

If they keep student home, many families will struggle with daycare issues.  And if they bring students in, many families, like yours, will struggle to get to school on time.  Personally, I like the current approach.  School is open but absences not counted.  That way families can make their own choice on what to do.

That being said, I still think you should get involved.  Attending your school board meetings would be a great place to start, especially if you're willing to share your experience during the public comment portion of the meeting.

"They have household space heaters inside each of the greenhouse ""glasshouses"". We were mostly fine sitting out there last night. I kept my coat on, but would have been fine if I was wearing a sweater. You could feel the cold rush in when the server would open the door. The hostess told me they were cancelling outdoor reservations for today because it was going to be too cold. Also, they require a minimum of $100 per table when seated in the glasshouse. If you don't reach that, they will add the difference to a gift card.

I think this is the 4th time we've been there, and they've gotten better since they first opened. The food is really good, but pricey. The portions are generous though. I got the One Night Stand Detroit-style deep dish pizza. Very good and the right amount of toppings but it was messy to eat. [Look at this monstrosity](https://i.imgur.com/eFB5kie.png) We got some sweet wine that complimented the food, and I found the bottle on Binny's website for $10 while waiting for the food.

Congrats on the new job. Need an assistant? Joking but we have reservations for Fiamme tonight. Not celebrating anything. I just wanted to sit outside and have pizza. Lazy Dog as others recommended is always a good choice. I haven’t tried any of the others. We do Mexican at Fat Rosie’s or Uncle Julio’s more often than other genres. Hugo Frog and Rose Bud were the last two places we went to not Mexican. Or we went to Fogo de Chao steakhouse for my birthday.

"Congrats on the new job! I'm always recommending ""**Yamado**"" to people looking to eat in Naperville.

It's a sushi and ramen house with amazing food, the inside is not too big so it feels very cozy (which is great for days with weather like today), and the owners are extremely friendly but not in an obnoxious way. Whenever I've gone there with friends to celebrate something, the owner/chef chats with us for a minute, and sometimes will even bring out a free appetizer. Cannot recommend Yamado enough! The hidden gem of Naperville restaurants in my opinion.

"I have a few places, having lived here for most of my life. I can’t afford any of these places as I’m “old Naperville” (ranch style 70’s house). But! Here are my recommendations as a foodie/cook!:

Shinto Japanese Sushi and Steakhouse (hibachi and sushi! If you or anyone in your party likes Japanese cuisine)

Empire Burgers and Brews (lots of good American food and drinks to go round!)

Lazy Dog (American cuisine, something for everyone, and tons of in-house brews!)

La Sorella Di Francesca (really nice Italian restaurant! Family and I used to eat here every Christmas Eve. Great selection, food is delicious, beautiful choices in drinks and wine, white table cloth kinda place!)

White Chocolate Grill (really awesome American cuisine with a twist, something for everyone, and AMAZING desserts for sharing!!)

"1. Different. One explains specific phenomenons, the other includes many phenomenon and so is less useful for making specific points about specific phenomenon

2. No, it would account for some but not all. It's one factor out of many. For example, what is the work from home culture like, do they do that? What do they do in their cities for fun? Since it's winter are there lots of indoor events? What masking rules are in place, do they hug alot, .... . 

3. Well, yes. Vaccinations do and always have conveyed immune system response. That's not immunity. It means the immune system can respond faster to the infection than without it. With that, the body can reduce the population growth rate of virus inside the body so that the peak is reached sooner and at a lower magnitude. If that peak is still enough to be 1) detectable and 2) transmissible, you will 1) detect it and 2) transmit it, but the severity and duration will be less if the body had a head start in fighting it off. The same thing occurs with natural immunity. The strength of both relative to each other is wildly debated, especially when new variants come around. At a high level, both are good however relying natural immunity is not a successful strategy because it requires being truly infected first, and you know, there are a million Americans dead right now. Vaccines don't require that risk. And they also don't make you sterile, have better 5G, or whatever other shit that's put out there 

4. Yes. What more evidence is needed than what was gained during development, adult trials, child trials, and now months after implementation? What data are you missing? Long term risks? Ok. Sure. What are the long term risks you are afraid of and how would that come about? Are you envisioning the vaccine causing cancer? How would it do that and why would that not show up in short term trials and clinical tests? Cancers are long-term risks for alot of things, but only after chronic exposure; acute exposure doesn't cause long-term cancer, it causes short term cancer.

"1. Are you claiming local studies > real world data? 

2. Do increased tests compensate for outrageously high rates of infection in the some of the most highly vaccinated and boosted countries in the world? Surely, you need tests to get cases, but are you really going with that? 

3. Is a vaccine effective if it doesn't convey immunity? And whatever immunity is conveyed it's not as strong as natural immunity and wains after 3 months? Is that effective to you?
