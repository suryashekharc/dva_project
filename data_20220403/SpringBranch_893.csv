Personally I prefer texaspowerguide.com as it’s well worth the $10 for how much electricity we use, but it’s really only useful if you know historically how much electricity you use each month.

Either way stay away from the gimmicks (free nights, weekends, save under 1000 kWh/mo, etc.) and find the lowest fixed rate plan.

All of the EFL’s should explain, but you pay ~$0.05/kWh to the local wires CenterPoint plus your energy charge (usually another ~$0.06/kWh) to whoever you sign up with.

"There are quite a few parents who take an apartment *south* of I-10 specifically to get into the Memorial area schools. As long as your name is on the lease, your kids qualify. Some are low income and are sacrificing a lot to get their kids a better chance, as they see it.

In the long run it's good for Spring Branch to have more houses; the tax revenues, if spent wisely, will improve the schools around here over time. For now, this area is sort of affordable and naturally attracts poorer folks. The school district does what it can; free meals because starving students can't learn, etc. But the averages and therefore the stats are going to be against us for a long time yet.

If you are engaged and involved with your kid's education, you'll be fine. I personally wouldn't hesitate to put my kids in pre K or elementary here.  I'm not sure how the middle and high school culture is these days though.

"So, most people consider Wilchester to be Memorial not Spring Branch. You are correct it is SBISD, though and probably the original German settlers considered that Spring Branch, also. Now mostly it is just north of I-10 from 610 to the reservoir that is regarded as Spring Branch.  That's off topic though. The bottom line is unless you're zoned to a school you deem good enough for your kids, you need to move or find a private school. Those will run you 20k per child per year. With the influx of townhouses and apartments, you aren't getting a school transfer unless you are politically connected. Moving out of Spring Branch was a great decision though. I didn't realize how tired I was of the I-10 Memorial City traffic, constant flooding and the run down parts. I do miss the close proximity to town and a few good restaurants I liked.

While I believe that the board usually has the best intentions for the ENTIRE district, it is very difficult to hold in our minds ""how the other lives"" that goes both ways. We can read, study, visit, and try to experience ""how the other lives"" but until we spend years in their shoes, we won't get close

Exactly you hit the nail on the head. Aldine is a Single Member District scheme and still the racial make up of the board does not match the student body. It did not work as Hispanics make up 74% of the students while non-Hispanics make up 72% of the school board. If you're looking for predetermined racial outcomes then the real fix is to write a law that ISD board members will be appointed by a select small group of elites/leaders who know better than the masses (thus my reference to racial communism, the fix to your problem is to do away with democracy and have a elite committee choose our boards).

Also interesting about Aldine being a SMD, of the seven board members five were initially appointed to the board. That may seem like smoke filled back room stuff.... it really is not. Aldine is just dealing with one of the many issues of SMD which is Aldine sliced and diced its ISD into neighborhood voting districts and the board has had to appoint five members over the years because in the past there were vacancies were no one ran for the various Single Member District school board seats.

Its likely SBISD would end up in the same situation. SBISD has had a hard enough time getting people to run across the whole district, slicing the districts up will exacerbate vacant board seats having to being filled by the existing board (which no one should want save for existing board members).

If Virginia wants to win a board seat then she needs to run a compelling campaign against a weaker candidate. She did neither of those things. Chris Earnest was a juggernaut reaction to the current board's mishandling of COVID and the resulting explosive grassroot mass of people that rose up against the current incumbents. Virginia was tone deaf to miss that storm and instead sailed straight into it when she had a clear alternative. Virginia probably would have won if she had picked to run against a weakened Mindy Caesar instead of Chris Earnest. Bad choice and not a great campaign on Virginia's part.

Even you must see that the last election was a referendum on recent past board actions and had little to do with Virginia.... other than people thought Virginia, not Chris, would simply mirror the current board member and govern in line with them (not very diverse).",t2_9uaq2y6q,DeifiedTexan,0,1625361894.0,0,t1_h3z8pbi,h3z8pbi,False,No-Establishment2691,t3_o518vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringBranch/comments/o518vj/virginia_elizondo_is_a_bad_loser/,Virginia Elizondo is a bad loser,/r/SpringBranch/comments/o518vj/virginia_elizondo_is_a_bad_loser/h3z8pbi/,2,r/SpringBranch,0,2

"There is no dilution of any voters in the district. The facts are all 80k+ legal voters in SBISD can run for school board and vote on every Trustee. No one is denied the vote and any adult living in the district can run for the board.

Lets take a look at Aldine ISD, five of the Aldine board members are non-Hispanic (4 blacks, 1 white) while the district's students  are 74% Hispanics, 22% black, 1.7% white. Oh no!! lets send in VIRGINIA ELIZONDO and her lawyer to sue as 72% of the board is non-Hispanic AND clearly Aldine is racist.

Is Aldine racist? No. Do Hispanics vote less than blacks in Aldine? Probably.

What does that say about the Hispanic voters in Aldine ISD? Are their votes being suppressed by a vast conspiracy of blacks against Hispanics because of systematic racism? Nope.

My guess is Hispanics would turnout if they did not like the governance of Aldine ISD. Hispanics who don't vote in Aldine ISD elections either like Aldine ISD governance or are ambivalent. Further I speculate that Hispanic parents maybe more likely to be transient than blacks in the district. Hispanic parents may live at a higher rate in apartments and/or move more often than blacks in Aldine. We know parents who are likely to move vote less. There are lots of reasons.

Should Aldine immediately remove three of the black/white board members and replace them with Hispanics? Of course not.

In Aldine there is access to run for school board and vote for school board and its up to residents to be interested enough to do either.

"It’s a false point.  I read your research paper.  At-large districts (according to your research) benefit specific groups in specific conditions. Single member districts benefit certain groups and hurt others.  Making this change might benefit a Latino male candidate but would likely (according to your paper) hurt female representation and dramatically curtain potential black representation.

That leads me to think it’s specifically an effort to defend the ideology of the current board against people who don’t like the direction the board is going … nothing about race.  It’s a strategy to avoid being accountable for strategic mistakes.

The entire point is that at-large elections dilute the vote of minority communities. That’s what the lawsuit is about. It’s based on sound research that goes back decades. Spring Branch has chosen to not adopt Single Member elections and that has led to a people on the school board that do not represent the people of the district.,t2_117x93,modestothemouse,0,1625200228.0,0,t1_h3rny0k,h3rny0k,False,No-Establishment2691,t3_o518vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringBranch/comments/o518vj/virginia_elizondo_is_a_bad_loser/,Virginia Elizondo is a bad loser,/r/SpringBranch/comments/o518vj/virginia_elizondo_is_a_bad_loser/h3rny0k/,2,r/SpringBranch,0,2
"The eligible adults that are assumed to be in Elizondo's camp chose not vote for her in sufficient numbers for her to win.  That does not imply that the system wouldn't allow her to win.  

Eligible voters also need to be citizens.  I understand the idea that people who are raising families (but do not have the right to vote should have a voice) but lack of citizenship is not the fault of the at-large voting system nor is single district voting the answer to lack of citizenship.

The trustees of SBISD have historically done right by all the students in the district in a non-partisan and appropriate manner.  They do a thankless job with the interests of all the children at the forefront.  

Go compare Ridgecrest Elementary facilities to Memorial Drive Elementary and tell me that they have shortchanged anyone.  Additionally, note how there are extra staff at the Latino schools compared to the ""rich"" schools.

"The numbers would suggest that she didn't campaign in 2015.  I don't have the figures for the other time she ran pre-2021.

What keeps racially diverse candidates from getting elected is when they don't run for the thankless job of being a trustee.  In many of the trustee elections they run unopposed.  That doesn't portend racial anything.  It is a thankless job that is a burden to the holder.

In this case, one could argue that she is ""racially diverse"" but by virtue of her PhD is not representative of the socioeconomic group that supposedly suffers for lack of representation.  I have not seen any evidence that the Latino student population has an inferior experience to that of the white students (at least that can be attributed to anything related to the school board.)

She is divisive in a non-partisan election. Her representation is unlikely to be ideologically different in any way than that of the other trustees. The voters did not choose her.  The correlation with her being Latina and losing the election does not imply causality.

Also, the correlation with >50% of the student body being Latino also doesn't imply that >50% of the people who want to be on the board are Latino.

She lost in a fair election held in a fair system that enfranchises \~80,000 people to have their voices heard but seldom gets more than 2000 votes.  The system is not inherently biased, it suffers from a lack of interest.  For the first time in a long time there was a hotly contested election and 8758 people voted in it which means \~11% of the eligible voters bothered to cast a vote.  If Elizondo were to get 1825 more people to vote for her she would have won.

Perhaps she should have run against one of the other white people, maybe the one who ran uncontested in 2021, perhaps she would have fared better if she had not run against the candidate who is ideologically different than she.

Our children deserve better than what HISD has to offer.  Turning SBSID into an HISD clone is folly.

"Whether you think unionizing the schools is a good thing or not, be open about it.  Personally I suspect that unionizing the workforce of SBISD is unnecessary.  I could be wrong and I am willing to listen to arguments on either side.  That being said, if that is the conversation and there is demand to unionize, make that the issue instead of throwing out the election system under the guise of a sour-grapes-three-time-trustee-election loser claiming racism.

Nobody is mentioning that the **ENTIRE board of trustees endorsed Elizondo** and the voters did not choose her.

Virginia Elizondo represents HISD thinking.  People move away from HISD into the more highly taxed SBISD to get away from the underperforming HISD.  Her experience is all HISD.  The stench of HISD management and subsequent performance is not something to emulate.

In the suit, they assert that SBISD is 58% Latino and 27% white and let the reader assume that means that 58% of the eligible voters are Latino.  Whether it is a function of larger families (more kids) or parents ineligible to vote, the details of racial identity in enrollment do not determine the number of eligible voters.  **Voting is for all eligible adults who live in the district, including those who don't have kids.  The community is NOT just parents with children currently enrolled at SBISD**.

**Single voting districts would disenfranchise a large group of tax paying citizens in exchange for giving the citizens of specific geographical areas an** ***outsized voice based on racial identity***.  That is the kind of thing the voting rights act was designed to limit or eliminate.

I think there are other locations, but I think it is still a family shop. My favorite fast casual burger in Houston (next are 5Guys, Fuddruckers, and Smash for taste reference).

A little on the pricy side $15 for a cheeseburger combo but unless I am famished, my wife and I will split a burger and fries.

Friend got the Monster Burger, it was a monster, looked delicious. Another got the buffalo chicken strips- looked like he got damn near a whole chicken's worth of strips. Good buffalo sauce too!

Quesadillas were pretty good and filling too.
If I remember correctly on the weekends they were offering beans with their meals (maybe an old promo).

"I shouted out my favorite joint, [The Branch](http://www.thebranchhtx.com/) these last two threads, but I also wanted to say that their [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/thebranchhtx/?hl=en) is awesome for finding new stuff. In order to help support local, the owner (Kyle) tries to visit a new restaurant in the area every day, and posts about them. It's worth a follow if you like to find hidden gems.

That's how I found [Tacos Dona Lena](https://g.page/tacosdonalena?share), which might have the best tacos in SB. I know, that's a bold claim, but they are badass.

Worth noting also that Tornado Taco has rebranded to [7Taco](https://www.7taco.com/). The breakfast tacos remain excellent.

Also a shoutout to [Simply Greek](https://goo.gl/maps/BeWmUPXLmBthGHYQA), which also has a pretty interesting burger and superhero themed hot dog menu. Definitely not just your standard stuff. On my to-do is a ""Hawkeye"" dog- flaming hot cheetos, peanut butter, and sriracha mayo.

[Roostar Grill](http://www.myroostar.com/) is still kicking out bangin' Bahn Mis.

If you're thinking Micheladas, check out [La Pasadita Preparadas](https://goo.gl/maps/fehczwMwG6sKFDhV7). There's a drive thru ;)

I also recently tried out [Buzz N Bites Coffee Shop](https://g.page/buzznbites?share). Very quaint and clean coffee joint. A nice surprise I found that ""grilled cheese bites"" is really just a grilled cheese sandwich. Not that I was disapointed!

I've also been able to satisfy multiple asian food cravings at once with [Thai Jin](https://g.page/thaijinhoutson?share).

"I live in Spring Branch and I know parents in the Woodlands.

In terms of appearances, the Woodlands beats ""in town"" hands down. I love that you can walk down the street to the closest woodland sidewalk, hit the conveniently paved trail (nice and shady), and go as far as you like. You could send them to the store (depending on which neighborhood / how far). The Woodlands is a residential bubble surrounded by retail, all carefully managed. There is nothing notably wild or natural about it; it looks pretty but it will not stir up your kids' imaginations.

Spring Branch is more raw, more urban, and alive in a messy and unmanaged sort of way. It is not much to look at, although there is a [long term proposal to make Long Point very pedestrian/bike friendly](https://sbmd.org/longpoint/). Granted your kids may be grown up by the time this hits your area, but it could mean your property value is enhanced. Since you want the kids out and about, Hedwig Park and the County Library next to it are #1 in my book, and often busy. And yes, that means learning how to cross the I-10 feeder roads. Get a safety flag for any bicycles involved. Trini Mendenhall Community Center is fun, but a lot of its programs seem to be geared toward seniors. You'll probably vote there. I love walking to the polls. Overall Spring Branch is 50% Hispanic; H Mart and 99 Ranch are mini adventures in culture; Polonia is right up the road and the Polish festival is at the church on Blalock. Your immediate neighbors I don't know, but the area as a whole is culturally diverse while the Woodlands is still 80%+ white.

As far as commuting from the Woodlands goes, one of the parents previously mentioned leaves at 5:30 to 6:00am for work in town, and never, ever goes home before 6:00pm. In other words, go for the ""non-peak"" hours if you want to get there and back again in any normal amount of time.

"Honestly no.  There are a couple of guys I trust with basic stuff like an alternator or battery, but I've struggled to find someone I can trust with a bigger repair like a water pump or clutch or something like that.  It's really frustrating.

I know a lot about cars as I used to wrench on them when I was younger and I've stayed pretty informed with the current systems.  I get pretty upset with I get BS answers or lines from the mechanics.  Sometimes they will lie to you, sometimes they are lazy.  I've had it happen with both dealer and independent mechanics.

Right now I'm dealing with what should be a minor issue:  I can't get my &^$% radio to work.  Mazda said it was the amplifier and quoted me $1500 for a new one.  I put in a $75 known-good salvage amp from the same model year car and it didn't help.  Took it to a car stereo place; they said the head unit was bad.

"Yours is a good description so far as I'm concerned. I would agree with everything habs81 just said. Some of the schools don't get the attention they deserve, considering the reputation of the school district as a whole. That being said, from what I've experienced they are staffed with competent people who are trying their best.

My only regret, if you can call it that, is that development is continuing and various empty fields now have housing projects (Kolbe Farms, as an example). I don't see horses around here any more, although I am pretty sure some are being kept here and there. With the loss of more grasslands may come an increased chance of flooding; time will tell. Straddling the border between two watersheds has been a huge advantage here, far more important than I ever would have suspected when I moved here.

"Location, location, location... Spring Branch has a lot going for it these days with regard to its proximity to employment and cultural centers: Downtown, Galleria, Westchase, Memorial City, and Energy Corridor.  Homes built in 50s and 60s have large yards and old growth trees.  Throw in that most homes within the Spring Branch area did not flood during Hurricane Harvey and you've got safe, quality housing.  Spring Branch has an excellent offering of eating establishments from all over the world: examples of Korean, Honduran, Mexican, Vietnamese, and others can be found easily within the district. Redevelopment of the Long Point corridor as Spring Branch's ""Main Street"" is on its way - check out the recently completed [Livable Centers Study](http://sbmd.org/longpoint/) conducted by the taxpayer-funded Spring Branch Management District.  The study notes that it is important to maintain the neighborhood's eclectic restaurants and business during redevelopment, which I personally agree with - we have so many great restaurants and a unique history behind the reason they're there in Spring Branch.

Now for the tradeoffs... schools are improving but not quite up to the standards that schools south of I-10 are at.  The bar has been set high, but there is reason for optimism.  Roads are beat up in some areas, and sidewalks are missing from some neighborhoods for those who like to get out and walk.  By and large, motorists are mindful of pedestrians within neighborhoods thankfully.  Long Point Redevelopment aims for a pedestrian-friendly and bike-friendly environment.  Public safety and crime are minimal - [you can view crime on this map](https://www.crimereports.com/map?CRSearch=Houston,%20TX).  I'm less concerned of property crime and targeted assaults than I am with random violent crime.  Random violent crime can be scary because you can't do anything about it, and I'm pleased to say that random violent crime in Spring Branch does not appear to be a problem; I feel completely safe at all times of the day in our neighborhood west of Gessner between Westview and Hammerly (Nob Hill Park area).

I’m not trying to be rude. It’s just no feasible to vote on developments and still maintain a healthy economy. 

You can however make a fuss about it to your city council representative and if he or she is worth a damn then they can look into the development to make sure the developer is following all the rules. That representative could request the developer to make an extra effort to insure the development doesn’t flood but the developer could just donate to their campaign and make the representative not care and then you’re back in the same situation.

"It's hardly an architectural masterpiece, but the building at 9101 Long Point (at Campbell) that currently is ""The Post Bingo"" was built in the first wave of suburban construction in 1950. It used to be a grocery store (Wegmanns? If it matters I can ask.)

There's actually quite a few 50s survivors. Used to be a number of gas stations with triangular awnings; I think there's only one left over on Witte, and it's looking pretty rough. I don't know too many off the top of my head, though if you look around you can tell by the architectural style and confirm via HCAD's website.

For businesses, just randomly I know Forsyth Floors on Long Point has been around since 1947, though not in the same building. I imagine there's a few others like that. Even longstanding traditions like El Gallo are likely to not be quite old enough.

There are of course a lot of residential survivors still.

Finding pre-war buildings is the real tough job. Besides the St Peter's church, there's a 1939 building that I think is an old farmhouse at Bingle and I-10. It's a private residence, I think, so don't go bother them. I don't really know of any besides those. Sadly, HCAD doesn't provide a way to search by year built.

The real ""historic attraction"" is of course the Hillendahl family cemetery on Long Point and Pech.

This is actually a pretty good time to think about historic structures in the area; the wave of gentrification creeping north from the freeway will soon destroy of lot of them.

"Welcome, and congratulations! Spring Branch is laid back, practical, and doesn't take itself too seriously - three of the best things about Houston itself, IMO. It's fun to explore. There are streets that don't look too far removed from our farm and woodland heritage, many still with acre lots. I'm not going to say you're in the country, but you *did* just miss the horses that used to be in the field where Edgewood is now, but now and again cows still graze at Kempwood just inbound of the Beltway, about 3 miles west from there. I hope SB never loses this mix of old and new.

Shopping is not next door, but convenient enough if you have a car. I'm partial to Korean BBQ (numerous places on or near Long Point), banh mi shops, Aquarium World on 290, Ikea on I-10, and Becker's Books on Westview. MAM (Memorial Assistance Ministries) on Blalock has a good quality thrift store and a variety of volunteer opportunities.

For fun, there's a Dave & Busters at Marq'E; Speedy's Fast Track on Hempstead Hwy. has a more traditional video arcade and other stuff; iFly skydiving simulator on I-10; and Sky High Sports trampoline park way out Westview if you need to wear out some kids. There's an AMF bowling place up on 290 (haven't been there) and Bowlmor just south of I-10.

"Congrats on the house ! Spring branch is generally okay but even so, it's not uncommon for you to hear lots of noise. Cars with loud music or exhausts roll by at any given time. Gunshots are also somewhat common- mostly wannabe gangbangers shooting into the air for no reason. My buddy used to live right in the area where you're talking about and he said that he had people roll up to the corner of the block at night, pull out a gun and shoot in the air. I've seen it happen in my immediate area too a mile or so north west of you. Not trying to scare you, but it does happen. It's all a part of living so close to areas with poorer income households and so many apartments, in my opinion. 

The good parts outweigh the bad I think. Close to two major highways, good eating of ALL types of food, no major flooding. I'm currently renting and wouldn't mind buying a house in your area but they're just too darn expensive for my budget.

"Finally had a chance to visit last saturday (6/18). Arrived shortly before 7pm. Big mistake. Line was huge and even the line for to go orders was very busy. Waited 1/2 for a to-go order. They still have a lot of kinks to work out but the food is still good. If you call in for an order, i heard if they are not answering phones, the call will roll over to the Montrose location. They will happily take your order. Then when you show up at the Memorial location, they won't have it ready. Make sure you confirm the location when ordering over the phone. Also, i saw that they have a curbside pick up option. I'm not sure how it works or how well it works. This location has a dessert bar like the Montrose location and they added a gelato bar too. It all looked pretty good. Way more seating and a lot of great parking. I'm so happy i don't have to travel all the way out to the Montrose location anymore!

The lack of zoning is what has given Houston it's character but also it's biggest issues.  But we are trying to create some kind of guidance with the comprehensive plan which should be completed and approved early next year.  The powerpoint and other material about the plan will be on our website next week.  It looks at making the district walk-able and bike-able among other development issues.,t2_jtaa7,SpringBranchDistrict,0,1417819064.0,0,t1_cmmewo4,cmmewo4,False,SpringBranchDistrict,t3_2odz5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpringBranch/comments/2odz5j/i_am_the_director_of_services_for_the_spring/,I am the Director of Services for the Spring Branch District - Ask Me Anything,/r/SpringBranch/comments/2odz5j/i_am_the_director_of_services_for_the_spring/cmmewo4/,1,r/SpringBranch,0,1
"This right here is what makes the District different from most.  Many management districts go out of their way to cut all residential developments out of their boundaries.  And it does make sense as they do not pay the assessment and districts can not by law provide any direct benefit to the residential properties.  But we understand that unless you have a healthy and thriving residential community you will not have a healthy and thriving commercial community.  One way to have a healthy residential community, apartments included, means good schools.  

Now development is a part of this equation.  All the new development has always stopped at Long Point in previous years.  Why?  Long Point is one of the diving lines for where kids are zoned for different schools.  But now we are seeing development moving past Long Point such as Frank Lui's development as mentioned above.  That's important because his new development is being built around Edgewood Elementary.  More houses means more families which means more students which means more funds for the schools.  Will it happen over night?  No.  

Look at Pine Shadows Elementary.  Many of the students that go their are from lower income families. The principal told me many of the students there are on free lunch programs.  The ISD built a brand new campus that is one of the most beautiful and well equipped schools I have ever seen.  They even have a top notch SPARK park they just had it's ribbon cutting opening ceremony.

That leads me to the District's involvement in all this.  We work with numerous groups in the area like MAM, YMCA, Boy Scouts and Newspring to name a few.  We have helped to fund vocational programs and many other education related programs and outreach.  Why?  Economic development.  If students have good education in stable neighborhoods they will then go on to be not just upstanding citizens but also future employees, employers and entrepreneurs (One program we have helped with funding was a young entrepreneurs program).  

One thing we have done is working with the Boy Scouts we have helped in setting up Boy Scout troops in apartment complexes.  This isn't just a matter of economic development but also public safety.  If kids are in the scouts then they aren't running around causing problems or getting involved with gangs.  It gives them a stability that they might not have.

That leads to our multifamily events that we have begun having.  The first couple we did had low turnouts and we learned our lessons.  The most recent one was held in partnership with a middle school.  We had an amazing turnout, best we had ever seen.  But it wasn't just a collaboration with the school but the YMCA, Boy Scouts, New Spring, HPD, Constables, local businesses, Crime Stoppers and numerous other groups.

"Ok.  I understand you aren't happy with the direction Spring Branch is going but the District does not have regulatory authority.  Houston is a special case in city development and planning.  It has no zoning (The exception being TIRZ 1) and has had no real planning guidance from the city.  It's always been a matter of if it's your property it's your right to do with it as you please.  

You mention the flea market being demolished.  At the community meeting last night people clapped when it was brought up.  The people at the meeting were all long time residents of the area.  Houston is growing and changing fast.  Some reports are that we are growing at over two thousand people a month.  So that leads to two choices:  Urban sprawl in the outlying regions (Sugar Land, Fulshear, Katy, Pearland) which increases drive time into the city.  Or higher density and redevelopment in the city.  More and more people are choosing to live in the city.  

The pictures look like Frank Liu's development at Emnora and Hollister.  If that's the case it's funny that those were the ones that you used for your example as that is where my Father is having a house built.  He used to live in Fulshear but got tired of an hour and a half drive.  He'll be moving in there with my grandmother sometime early next year.  Small lot sizes, town homes and patio homes are the current development trend in Houston.

But the district is cognizant of the fact that that kind of development can't be the only development in the area. One thing discussed as part of the development of the comprehensive plan is preserving existing neighborhoods in the District.  

One of the major goals of the Comprehensive Plan is for understanding that change is coming and to try and guide the change in a way that benefits all as much as possible.

We have limited interaction with TIRZ 17 on an informational basis but we do not have any joint projects.  I know they are doing reconstruction of Gessner up to Long Point and then the City will be doing the reconstruction from there.
