"We haven't really had any issues.  The only small thing we had was my son turned the waterfall shutoff knob a lot hard than he should have so the waterfall  wouldn't completely turn off it kind of trickled.  Aspen spas came out and fixed the knob by I think returning it to it's original position.  It's been very reliable.  In fact they even saw my video review where I complained about the filter cover design and they came and replaced it for free without me even asking.  Pretty cool.  

They put the hot tub in the exact spot I wanted it in the backyard.  Installed the cover lifter. They filled it up with water, balanced the chemicals, and gave me a tutorial.

"Thank you for sharing your review.  We are also in the market for a hot tub and it's frustrating trying to figure out which brands are reliable and offer local repair services in case something goes wrong.  If you don't mind, I have a few questions about your experience with your Aspen hot tub:

* Aside from routine upkeep (e.g., chemicals, filters, etc), has the hot tub required any other services or repairs?  Does Aspen offer repair services?  Based on the youtube video upload date, it sounds like you've had it for at least a few years.

* Do they drop the hot tub at the driveway or actually carry it over to where the hot tub will be installed?

* Would you mind sharing what the price of your hot tub ended up being?  I've found it difficult to compare prices unless I buy from somewhere like Costco or Sam's that openly display their prices, but then the issue of serviceability arises if I buy from those stores.

"People haven't forgotten. It's just that the MM consistently breaks the Pact between gaming stores in the area.

The Pact is simple: a store does not run the same type of event as another store on the same day, with the exception of FNM and Commander so they don't undercut each other.

There are three stores who consistently broke the Pact:

1. MM
2. Mystic TCG
3. Moonbase Market - Which went out of business.

For the longest time, MM was running MTG events at a loss to draw in players from nearby gaming stores.

"They still have to have probable cause to stop a car and typically has to be a moving violation (speeding, failure to maintain a single lane etc).

I’m my experience, it usually turned into more arrests for felonies (convicted felons with firearms, felony drug possession, or felony warrants). Or the officer’s working their normal shift get calls about drunk drivers and the people doing saturation would handle it instead and take any DWIs that night, which was always helpful. 

Depending on the person and the DWI, it could take the whole night to handle one. Especially a felony DWI.

"Appreciate that, AppreciativeFuck.

What are your thoughts on the saturation/traffic grants?  On the surface it seems much more reasonable.  Yes, look to keep the streets safe from drivers under the influence, but don't stop me just to randomly check.  

The thought of check points gives me a real dystopian/ police state vibe, it just makes me uncomfortable and resentful.

But the thought of police out there looking specifically for drivers being unsafe and possibly under the influence makes me feel more safe.

The other side, I guess, is that they can use the justification to pull literally anyone over and abuse that power.  Which I'm sure happens.

She led the Children's Vaccine Clinic Cheer Squad last November at the Spencer Road Library.  
Her group is all about planning and providing cheer groups for children's vaccine events which are targeted to be attended by protesters. The goal is to provide fun and engaging environments to help draw the kids' attention away from protesters which may include messaging that is scary to young children.  
One parent commented:  
""We were nervous because we'd heard there would be protesters at this optional childern's event. And there were, but 10x's the amount of people showed up to show support, smiling ear to ear, blowing bubbles and cheer on the kids going in. Faith in humanity restored just in time for the holidays.""",t2_4haca,chiang01,0,1647748597.0,0,t1_i1d5wii,i1d5wii,True,dmxrob,t3_thvgb9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StCharlesMO/comments/thvgb9/fort_zumwalt_school_board_election/,FORT ZUMWALT school board election,/r/StCharlesMO/comments/thvgb9/fort_zumwalt_school_board_election/i1d5wii/,3,r/StCharlesMO,0,3

[FHSD Board Election Candidates 2022](https://www.fhsdschools.org/cms/One.aspx?portalId=995782&pageId=48974135)

[Christine Hyman](https://www.christine4fhsd.com/)

>My family moved to St. Charles in 2005. I have three children; Elizabeth (FHN 2010) teaches at UMKC. Corey (15), does not attend FHSD and, Elise (14) will graduate FHN in 2025. I worked ten years at the St. Charles Convention Center as the venue Accounting and HR Manager. I am active in the community as a volunteer with animal rescue and was a Girl Scout leader/co-leader for seven years. I have been involved with FHSD since 2006. I have been a room mom, building/classroom volunteer and am still involved with PTO.  
  
>At the district level I have been a member of the Strategic Academic Planning Committee, and Interview Committee for Superintendent when Dr. Sloan retired and Dr. Hendricks-Harris was hired. I've been attending School Board Meetings since 2006. I am a Board Member and National Chapter Director for TransParentUSA. I am an advocate for women, children and the LGBTQ+ Community. I am a small business owner. I enjoy reading non fiction and listening to Classic Rock. The kids and I enjoy hiking in our many St. Charles County Parks and spending time with our animal babies.

Adam Bertrand (website was unreachable)

>Adam Bertrand was raised in St. Charles County, an alumnus of the Francis Howell School District, and now a candidate for Board of Education.  After graduation he went on to get a degree from Mizzou and a MBA from Washington University in St. Louis.  He has four children in the district, and knows the importance of the educational system to district families.  
  
>Mr. Bertrand spent the last 15 years of his career helping businesses make improvements that lead to exceptional experiences for their clients and customers. His goal is to see the district make improvements within Fiscal Management, Educational Excellence, and Transparency.

[Randy Cook Jr](https://cookforfhsd.com/)

>I am a father with children in the district, a longtime resident of St. Peters, and an engineer. My focus as a board member will be on curriculum/academics, fiscal responsibility, support of our educators, and transparency to the public. The administration must be more transparent with spending so the board can properly understand the trade-offs and make fiscally responsible decisions. Prop S spending has clearly shown that we need a change on the school board if we ever expect suitable transparency and fiscal responsibility.  
  
>I will exercise prudence and limit spending to only those things that truly help students. I’ve read through teacher feedback from a recent survey and, in addition to salary increases, teachers are asking for things that do not cost money; we need to implement those we can. I believe each student deserves curriculum that appropriately challenges them, that’s why I support keeping challenge courses in our district, as well as programs for gifted students. Finally, I recognize that I will be accountable to the parents and our community—not the administration—I will never forget that.

[Justin McCoy](https://www.justinforfhsd.com/)

>I’m a father of two boys and a husband to my beautiful wife, Caitlin. I lost my mother at the age of 10 and went on to be raised by a single father. My little sister suffered from severe mental illness which created major challenges for my family growing up. Therefore, I completely understand the complications that happen on the other side of my neighbors’ front doors.  
  
>I believe all children in FHSD deserve equitable access to a quality public education. All personal politics belong outside of teachers' ability to provide opportunities for their students' futures and enhance their ability to capture those opportunities. Our teachers always need to be heard, supported, and valued as they mentor and empower the foundational skills for our children to become lifelong learners prepared for adulthood. For FHSD to provide the best stewardship in this process, I believe that the publicly elected School Board decisions directly affecting our kids' educations should be made based on facts, equity, measurable data, and supported by advice from experts in their respective fields. I want all children within our community to grow up in a school where they feel supported, encouraged, motivated, loved, heard, respected, and challenged.

[Rick Rice](https://www.rickforfhsd.com/)

>My wife and I moved to the Francis Howell School District twenty-one years ago. We have three children and three grandchildren. I’m a graduate of Pattonville High School and have a Bachelor’s Degree in Economics from the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a second Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science from Lindenwood University. For the past thirty-six years, I worked in the transportation industry managing, selling, and supervising. I’m also the founder of a software company that develops and maintains critical hazardous material software for the top shipping and logistics companies.  
  
>In the past year, I left full time work to focus on growing my business and to spend more time with my family. This school year, I started substituting part time as a paraprofessional in the Francis Howell School District and have enjoyed getting to know the students and staff members in our district. I also hold a certificate in substitute teaching from Missouri DESE. I’m running for the Francis Howell School Board because I believe the board needs a member from the business community to help care for the district’s and taxpayer’s financial interest while creating the best possible educational experience for our students.

Mike Hoehn (no website)

>I have proudly served on the BOE for twelve years. During my time on the BOE our district has achieved many great things and is one of the top districts in the state. I am honored to be on many committees as an advocate for our community, teachers and kids. I am an active community member. My priority has always been the students, not the latest political movement. My priority will continue to be the students, that they continue to get a great education. I take pride that our community gets the most value for their tax dollars.  
  
>To say that the last two years have been a challenge is an understatement. Last year, we were one of a handful of schools to offer a choice of in-person learning or virtual. The best place for kids to learn is in the classroom.  I have had to make numerous votes regarding masks. Each and every vote was made to provide students with the opportunity to stay in school or to provide additional safety.

"Last time we were there two guys got in a fight over a kid. I think the dad was trying to pick the kid up and the other guy (step dad maybe?) was saying he should stay longer. Went from yelling to shoving over tables really quick. 

Also, there was a little shit who would wait for kids to pay their money for a game then push them out of the way and start playing. When parents tried to say something to him he'd flip them off without making eye contact. I saw one mom try to move the kid and he started screaming and hitting her, it was wild.

"Oh hi! I just am in the process of getting my first and middle name changed. I’m not sure about name changes after marriage though. This is not legal advice, this is just what I did:

First, I filled out this form and got it notarized: https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=55062

Then I went to the court on 300 N 2nd Street in St. Charles and security directed me to the correct office. The nice clerks gave me a checklist for all the paper work I needed to fill out, because that one form wasn’t enough. If your husband follows this route, he can do it on the computers they have in the office. He also needs to watch this video. Also, I believe they have a notary there if he doesn’t get the form I linked notarized ahead of time. 

They handed me a green “checklist” to file the name change. Ensure he asks them for the blue form also because it has important codes on the back. I wasn’t given this and it took me forever to find the correct codes online. 

Also, be SUPER nice to the clerks because they aren’t legally allowed to tell you how to fill out the forms but they can make your life easier with where to find stuff online. 

Then, it cost $130. They set me up with a court date then and there. Also, they gave me a piece of paper with some local newspaper’s info on it because I need to send in a personal ad for like 3 weeks after my judgement. That’s… $35 I think? I also got a letter from one of the newspapers about it.

"Indifferent.  

I mean, sure, the fact that I don't personally live in the city (or even the county) plays a huge role in that. Additionally, I don't use public transport where the restrictions still apply.  

But I have NO ISSUES whatsoever with federally required mandates still applying to infrastructure with federal funding. Though, to be honest, I wish they'd loosen those restrictions sooner rather than later for the sake of the people who rely on those services.

"Could this eventually lead to large apartment projects in, say, Frenchtown? 

I don't live in St. Charles; I live in St. Louis City -- and I'm a transplant to the region -- so I don't know that much about St. Charles outside of a few visits to the Main Street area. 

My experience and feelings for St. Charles are that it is nice and charming. I myself prefer the more urban St. Louis City, but I find myself rooting for the entire region -- hence the reason I am here. 

I thought St. Charles had so much potential each of the two or three times I've visited since moving to St. Louis. 

Frenchtown seemed like it could use the pizzaz of a few new modern apartment buildings. Tastefully sneaking them into those districts would be impressive and could help create a true ""downtown"" St. Charles vibe. I'd love to see that juxtaposition of old and new -- but not on historic Main Street, of course. 

There is a historic charm to St. Charles that I respect and that I do not think should be messed with. I just wonder what St. Charles could look like if it embraced some density and modern vibrancy for those northern districts, North Town and Frenchtown, especially with the $2 billion riverfront project and that massive winery project in Augusta coming to the region.

"https://www.stlmag.com/news/what-is-the-riverpointe-project-in-st-charles/
> 
Klinghammer says that the project is referred to as a “no-rise development,” meaning that it will not affect the river upstream or downstream. Much of the project’s construction will simply consist of rearranging the dirt in the 100-year floodplain, but not removing any.
> 
Construction will also include a water quality basin, a water feature meant to catch floodwater before it reaches the riverfront and filter it. “That is going to give that water time for those pollutants to settle out of the water and basically be filtered before it goes into the river,” says Director of Engineering Brad Temme. The dirt dug from the water quality basin will also be put back onto the floodplain. “This is all in an effort to ensure that what we do here is not going to contribute to flooding upstream or downstream,” Temme says. “That's number one.”

Any project in a floodway must be reviewed to determine if the project will increase flood heights. An engineering analysis must be conducted before a permit can be issued. The community's permit file must have a record of the results of this analysis, which can be in the form of a No-rise Certification. This No-rise Certification must be supported by technical data and signed by a registered professional engineer. The supporting technical data should be based on the standard step-backwater computer model used to develop the 100-year floodway shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM).",t2_4lfib,jasonchristopher,0,1646165422.0,0,t1_hyydi6c,hyydi6c,False,jasonchristopher,t3_t4bu33,https://www.reddit.com/r/StCharlesMO/comments/t4bu33/st_charles_mayor_says_multibillion_dollar_project/,St. Charles mayor says multi-billion dollar project will redefine the city,/r/StCharlesMO/comments/t4bu33/st_charles_mayor_says_multibillion_dollar_project/hyydi6c/,3,r/StCharlesMO,0,3

St. Charles County has a rule that any new construction in the ""flood zone"" must be able to hold +80% of the water it used to hold before the new construction.  There's a bunch of ways to get exceptions, but the general rule is old buildings are grandfathered in. 

Also, nobody fucks with the flood plain without the Army Corps of Engineers blessing the project, and they're getting REALLY good at predicting the consequences.

"Without knowing the details of what’s going on, it’s entirely possible it’s the toilet itself. We had the standard contractor toilets in our house that would stop up every time we’d use more than about 4 squares of toilet paper (ok, I’m exaggerating a little bit, but not much). We’ve since replaced 2 of them, and hardly ever problems with them stopping up since. Replacing the toilet isn’t a very technical job - trust me, I’m no plumber, and I did it twice with no issues - and it’s a heck of a lot cheaper to do it yourself. Go to Home Depot or Lowes, and find the best flushing performance one you can afford. We got a couple of really good American Standard Champions for about $200-250 each. I know Kohler makes some good ones, as well. As for how to do it, if you go on YouTube and search for “replace toilet”, there’s a number of good instructional videos that come up.

I was put on 20500/yr salary so they could avoid paying OT. That salary was improperly low for an exempt employee(I think at the time the legal lower limit was 22500 or something pathetically low, but still, I was being paid less).

I had zero management responsibilities, it was clear cut wage theft and I did not actually qualify as exempt.

It was policy for employees to clock out when they hit 31.5 hours.  Besides it just being blatant wage theft, I imagine it had something to do with legal issues regarding benefits for full time employees.  It was a shitty deal but the tips paid the bills so their staff put up with it.

He died and was resuscitated only after suffering severe brain damage.  His wife eventually left, he walks with a walker, and he has severe problems with his speech.  All because insurance in this country is tied to employment, and a lot of people are hard workers that still get fucked over.

"I certainly haven't decided that I'm better at making medical decisions than a doctor generally.  I got a tetanus booster during the visit, on his recommendation.  I'm just not sufficiently convinced, for the case of a vaccine that has been through an abbreviated trial period, is for a disease that people in my condition typically recover from without incident, which I myself have recovered from without incident, and has been the subject of enormous political pressure.

I didn't initiate the conversation, I don't intend to bring up the topic with him again, and I don't doubt that he's a fine physician.  If he doesn't want me as a patient, I'll accept that without rancor.  I appreciate having a physician whose temperament offsets my own.  I just wasn't convinced by his argument in this particular case.

I've been on the other side of the coin.  I'm a mechanical engineer, and have a fairly good handle on thermodynamics.  I don't doubt that I know far more about thermodynamics and heat transfer than my old babysitter.  But I'd always been bothered by something she once said.  In the winter, she'd advised her son to refill the dogs' outside dish with cold water instead of warm water, saying cold water would freeze slower.  I thought it was crazy when I heard it as a nine year old, and I thought it was crazy all the way through engineering grad school.  It doesn't make sense thermodynamically.  Before water can freeze, it must reach 32F/0C (at atmospheric pressure).  Heat must be lost in order to cool hot water, which takes time.  The hot water first must turn into cold water before it can freeze, and the cold water starts that much closer.

Nevertheless, [the Mpemba effect](https://www.livescience.com/32128-does-hot-water-freeze-faster-than-cold-water.html) is real.  It may not be entirely consistent, and it's not entirely understood, but it exists.  My babysitter was right, and master's in mechanical engineering me was wrong.  So I try to stay open-minded about these things, whether I'm the one who ought to know the truth, or someone else is.  And I'm entirely ready to be convinced that adding a Covid vaccine to the long list of vaccines I've had is the right thing to do, but given the number of medical journal articles I've read on it, it's going to take something a little more concrete than ""trust me, I'm a doctor.""",t2_ys028,rothbard_anarchist,1,1645408860.0,0,t1_hxs3sl9,hxs3sl9,False,dagmar_sandwich,t3_svlwhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StCharlesMO/comments/svlwhm/looking_for_chill_pediatrician/,Looking for chill pediatrician,/r/StCharlesMO/comments/svlwhm/looking_for_chill_pediatrician/hxs3sl9/,0,r/StCharlesMO,0,0

"In my case, it was my doctor initiating a heated five minute argument with me during my initial visit, in front of his med student.  I'd had Covid in November of 2020 and again at the beginning of this year.  I told him I wasn't in a particular hurry to get the vaccine, and was interested in waiting for a next generation vaccine based on Omicron and delivered nasally.

I explained how I'm not in a hurry because of the strong protection that prior infection has been shown in several published studies to provide.  He countered by saying the dashboard data from the Kentucky Dept of Health was self-explanatory, and showed that there was no such protection.  I said I'd take a look at it, and asked if anyone had published anything based on that data.  He said it was just obvious looking at it, and no paper was needed.

I explained my interest in an Omicron-derived vaccine because the existing vaccines have been shown, again in published studies, to be so much less effective against Omicron, while Omicron exposure (I've seen conflicting reports on this) seems to protect well against Delta and Omicron.  He said it was silly to base vaccine decisions off of Omicron, with the implication that it could soon be replaced by another variant which was susceptible to existing vaccines.

Finally, I explained that I was interested in the nasal vaccine because of the study from a week or so ago that showed so much better protection, particularly in the upper respiratory tract, from an experimental nasally delivered vaccine over the traditional shot.  He asked how delivery method could possibly affect it, and acted like the study couldn't have validity since I personally couldn't explain the immunology behind the findings.

So... yea.  If he'd have countered the many studies showing good protection from prior exposure with any other legitimate publication from a peer-reviewed journal, I'd have felt a lot more confident in his competence.  But he really seemed to think that whatever the Kentucky department of health lists on their dashboard automatically overrode the notion of protection from exposure.  I can only speculate that fear was a driving factor in his behavior.",t2_ys028,rothbard_anarchist,0,1645226564.0,0,t1_hxif7w3,hxif7w3,False,dagmar_sandwich,t3_svlwhm,https://www.reddit.com/r/StCharlesMO/comments/svlwhm/looking_for_chill_pediatrician/,Looking for chill pediatrician,/r/StCharlesMO/comments/svlwhm/looking_for_chill_pediatrician/hxif7w3/,-13,r/StCharlesMO,0,-13

Portions of the area were listed as EPA Superfund cleanup sites in 1990. [Page 16 of this PDF](https://semspub.epa.gov/work/07/40260768.pdf) shows a map of the area. It's hard to tell, but it looks like this hole is located within the *Weldon Spring Training Area* section of the map. On the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weldon_Spring_Ordnance_Works#Weldon_Spring_Former_Army_Ordnance_Works_site) for the Superfund Site it says this:

>  
Contaminated areas are spread throughout the site, with the greatest concentration in the Training Area. Areas of concern include seven unlined lagoons where TNT wastewater was stored, TNT production lines, two DNT production lines, drainage ditches below TNT production lines, and eight areas where explosive wastes were burned.

My guess is this is one of the unlined toxic wastewater lagoons referenced.

In some of the older satellite imagery, you can see a trail branching off the main trail that leads to the hole.

Evening heading to neighbors and trying to turn them onto your “side” all over a document that the new owners are probably having reviewed by legal and may even be having trouble finding if the old owners didn’t keep great records. Fuck! This may even work out in your favor, no signed lease? Pack up and say you’re leaving. If they can’t produce your signed lease then you have no contract with them and can leave at any time, (you’d be considered month to month by the state at that point) why not just do that? Saves everyone a headache. like, bro, plows are busy, do you expect the gal you’ve been yelling at behind the desk to treck in and plow your walkway on a snow day?  I’d want to limit your interaction with my precious employees as well… last thing I need is for you to scare them off and now I d to hire someone new while dealing with you…",t2_ltkoo,RogaineWookiee,0,1644155337.0,0,t1_hvt6w3t,hvt6w3t,False,Lukage,t3_slcj8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/StCharlesMO/comments/slcj8d/renters_rights/,Renters rights,/r/StCharlesMO/comments/slcj8d/renters_rights/hvt6w3t/,2,r/StCharlesMO,0,2

"Thank you for the very sound follow-up. Seems that I'm on the right course, even if its $150 for the consultation and then a retainer is another $1500. If they suggest that small claims court would yield the difference (reduction of rent due to denied services and to me, maybe waiving repair/cleaning fees due to the lack of maintenance on this policy), I guess its worth it there.  


Either way, I'm clearly not living here a day after the end of my current lease.

"I am no lawyer but getting a proper copy of the lease would be ideal in this situation. If the lease terms guarantee you access to this clubhouse as a part of your lease because it contains certain amenities included in your lease, it's kind of hard for them to take them away from you because they don't like your attitude.

Missouri has some pretty crappy landlord tenant laws in the sense that they are pretty barren. That being said unless you're damaging the property, committing crimes in your living space, or not paying they really can't just evict you because they want to unless you signed a super shitty lease. I spent some time researching the landlord tenant law because I had a friend who refused to move out of my basement after giving them several months notice, it's not an easy process. You won't wake up one day and just be evicted. Even without a standing lease its a pain in the ass to do.

Speaking to a lawyer is probably going to be the best to help ease your mind. Generally there is an expectation of the ""quiet enjoyment of your home"" and most decent leases will govern the landlords access to your living space. I would be really surprised if they could just knock on the door and barge into your place because they feel like it. They would need a good reason such as having to perform emergency maintenance but that is a pretty clear and obvious reason. Otherwise, I'd expect a sufficient amount of written notice as well.

Talk to your lawyer get them to articulate a sort of tenants bill of rights for you and perhaps they can help you in getting a copy of your lease. In the long term, I would start looking for new places because these people sound toxic.",t2_56iniqz1,hybrid0404,0,1644101688.0,0,t1_hvr29n5,hvr29n5,False,Lukage,t3_slcj8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/StCharlesMO/comments/slcj8d/renters_rights/,Renters rights,/r/StCharlesMO/comments/slcj8d/renters_rights/hvr29n5/,3,r/StCharlesMO,0,3
"Thanks!  


So the restrictions are that all communication with the staff must be in writing and that I am to cease contact via phone or in person immediately (so this is any office personnel, maintenance, etc.). I am permitted to contact two people (the manager and assistant manager) by email.  


I am only allowed to contact them for emergency maintenance (so no questions about bills, reporting activity on the property, general maintenance, etc.)  


I am prohibited from the clubhouse other than to pay rent via the rent drop box. They reiterated the ban on verbal communication.

They then advised that ""if the verbal threats or harassment continue, it will result in termination of your lease.""

""Lastly, the St. Charles Police Department have been made aware of your behavior and informed that you are on the no trespassing list.""  


\---  


The problem is that I don't know where my printout of the lease is, right now, and the only copy they would provide was a summary document (the old property ownership company is only provided this as well). I'm trying to find it to review, but it doesn't include a lot of the ""section 50, blah blah"" stuff from the full contract and with their refusal to communicate unless it is in writing and only for emergency maintenance, they will not talk to me about it or clarify or provide the police report info. I'm otherwise at the mercy of their whim to evict me while also stuck paying full price for an explicit refusal of services.  


They came by yesterday afternoon to serve a physical copy of this letter, but tried to talk to me while I was telling a neighbor about this and they yelled out ""Oh are you harassing your neighbors too?"" I'm getting actively harassed by my property owners, threatening eviction, imposing communication restrictions that prevent me from asking questions about it or having basic amenities that other residents do.

"What sort of restrictions have they put in place? Do you have a copy of your lease? They can't trespass a tenant, you literally live there by contract. Missouri also doesn't permit self-help evictions meaning if the deny you access to your space that opens them up to be sued. The only way they can deny you access to your living quarters would be via judicial order that is later enforced by the sheriff. 

When it comes to regular maintenance, safety is the key here as well and the lease should have some mention of the landlord's responsibility. This responsibility is transferred when the property is sold whether the new landlord likes it or not.

That being said, if the relationship has really soured and you can afford a consult with an attorney that is probably your best bet.
