"> Maximizing cop safety while minimizing the public safety is the exact opposite of the ideal We the People inherited from our forebears.

What in the video makes you think the cops weren't minimizing public safety?

>Decency, humane treatment and following the law themselves isn't too much to ask.

I agree, but are we watching the same video? This guy wasn't following the law.

I would be more open to leftist viewpoints, but honestly it seems like they just take a pro-criminal/anti-victim viewpoint and pretend all criminals are just decent humane people. It's very bizarre, especially when they try to be the champion of victims.

There are times to bring out the 0.05% of cops that do bad things. This is not one of those times. When you start defending *every* piece of shit that gets what's coming to her/him, then when you bring out the actual (super rare) times of bullshit, no one cares anymore. As I said, this shit hurts the suspects way more than cops. Because now a lot of people may think they have the ""right"" to hold onto a phone while being arrested.

"Who snitched? How do they know these things? Did they call the cartel and ask them to forward a copy of their business plan? 

The laws set up to fight the cartels are crap. For some reason we can't even make spoofing illegal or prosecute the people who scam. Technology is great but why are we not using it? Are they afraid we will find out who is behind the cartels being able to supply the states? Or grow their crops? 

The war on drugs is a failure. It puts a burden on the taxpayers by having to pay for people who do drugs after they get in trouble. In 2013, according to the prison brochure, it cost $64,000 a year to take care of each inmate. It would be great if they would actually take care of people. Things are improving as far as pay to inmates and affordability of products needed while incarcerated.

The focus on people who consume illicit substances is taking away from the focus on finding out who commit heinous crimes. Like finding missing children, serial killers and squashing domestic abuse...as well as some other serious crimes in higher offices.

"one, meth is a poor person’s cocaine, so hopefully an inexpensive, better alternative, would lower the number of methamphetamine users. two, the illegality of meth has led criminal cartel producers to utilize  pre-cursor acrylate polymers which produce a higher amount of l-meth vs d-meth (see article below). this has led to the increase in mental health issues meth causes. as for safety- why produce yourself, make an inferior product, when a cheaper, safer alternative exists? if meth is sold inexpensively, but the most a person could legally acquire and utilize in 24 hrs was…a half gram? a gram? the probability of meth psychosis drops accordingly. if anyone goes above that, it’s time for rehab and/or mental/physical health intervention. the focus is harm reduction and removal of criminal elements from supply chain.

"Now hold on... he didn't ""clarify"" anything, he changed his statement from ""there is a mountain of evidence that diversity if bad"" to ""there is a mountain of evidence that diversity is good"" by adding a half dozen words that changed his initial sentence 180 degrees.

Then, after I say that *if* his original statement was true, then that would explain alot.

Then after he get's me to say something that on the surface now looks like I'm saying diversity is bad, then he completely flips his sentence to the opposite and calls that ""clarification.""

Irregardless, I said I don't agree with the school. I don't need to see this ""mountain of evidence"" to convince me their right.

And claiming to have a ""mountain of evidence"" that proves a point, and then saying that same evidence *dis*proves the same point, all while failing to produce this ""evidence"" makes the statement suspect either way.

I think the school is wrong in their actions like I said in the first place. I don't have to go back and edit that to make it say I think they are right instead and then say ""you misunderstood on purpose.""

If they have alot of evidence that diversity is bad, then I guess that would explain their position. Otherwise the explanation can only be ""because their just stupid"" which isn't a good reason. But trying to discuss what their reason is while switching the most basic discussion point just to make someone look like their position is based on a lie just means the discussion isn't even about the school anymore.

"The cost of damages done by BLM and the alt-right accelerationists who intentionally tried to cause damage so people like you would have talking points pales in comparison to the economic damages the wrongful deaths BLM was protesting cause every single year. A single human life is valued at about $10 million dollars to the economy.   


In 2021, 1139 people were killed by police, which outright is $11,390,000,000 economic damage cause by a service whose mandate is to *server* and *protect*. Now, with unexpected deaths there is further economic damages than just someone leaving the work force. They leave gaps that either take a lot of work to fill or greatly reduce what other people can contribute because they are no longer equipped with the right tools. As factual as that is there's no god way to estimate how much knock-on damage there is when police wrongfully murder someone. Courts believe that approximately $1.5 billion a year, the total amount of settlements tax payers pay out because of police actions, is sufficient though so lets use that number.  


So we're up to approximately $12,890,000,000 of damage done by police to communities every single year. A burden borne disproportionately by the parts of the community that are already the poorest and most vulnerable.  


Don't fucking talk to me about ""billions of dollars in damage"" when you are willfully ignorant of the amount of damage being suffered, every single year, by the people that protested.",t2_qhtbx,NotYetiFamous,0,1648980824.0,0,t1_i37hond,i37hond,False,DoremusJessup,t3_tu00g6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/tu00g6/ohio_couple_who_pulled_police_barricade_into/,Ohio Couple Who Pulled Police Barricade into Crowd Before Breaching the Capitol Building on Jan. 6 Sentenced to Probation,/r/Ohio/comments/tu00g6/ohio_couple_who_pulled_police_barricade_into/i37hond/,1,r/Ohio,0,1

"> This is about us and our radical dehumanization of people simply because we have abdicated our collective responsibility to police the police and those with police like powers.

It's simple: follow the cop's orders. Notice the suspect is facing *away* from the police officer. This is so the suspect can't see the police officer coming up towards him. When he holds a phone, he negates that advantage a police officer has. He can see the cop come up from behind him and execute a plan to escape.

Remember, these are dangerous felons. These aren't normal people. This guy knows he's fucked because it's a felony stop, so he's desperate. It's easy to sit on your laptop and say what you're saying, but you're not dealing with a guy who has a violent pass and a history of having illegal guns in his car, who is now facing years in prison.

He's disobeying police orders, that alone makes him dangerous. Cops aren't going to risk it.

If you want to avoid problems like this, don't commit crime but if you have an encounter with a cop **do not disobey their orders.**

Here are the charges for this guy's *first* arrest. What an outstanding citizen! 

Arrested Sep 06, 2019
• #1 aggravated menacing
• #2 obstruction of official business
• #3 resisting arrest
• #4 improper handling of firearms in a motor vehicle
• #5 driving under ovi suspension

"> Because they could safely and easily secured the suspect without tazing him. 

How? Explain. Since you're an expert on this.

1. He has a history of resisting arrest and having weapons in his vehicle and being violent.
2. He has disobeyed orders, so he is not being cooperative.
3. He can use the phone to see the officer's position, thus making the arrest unsafe.

You do realize this guy is a violent felon right? I know you guys love your violent felons, but cops aren't going to take any risks to appease some Redditors lol.

You have NO right to hold a phone while being under arrest.  

>Chemical weapons use on civilian populations is morally repugnant,

Who are you to define morality?  

>Civilized society must actually be itself civilized.

Yes, so when someone of authority tells you to put the phone down, put the phone down.

"Yes but unless they draw the conclusion to get the vaccine, their conclusions are incorrect. It’s not a matter of opinion. It’s exactly as wrong as saying 2+2=5. It can be your opinion that this is true, but it doesn’t alter reality in any way, shape or form.

Again the danger is when people who have drawn very clearly false conclusions (false as incorrect and there’s nothing else to say) and then they go and convince others of their falsehood.

You’re a farmer right? What if I spent all of my time saying that farmers are planting all crops with abortion medicine so that nobody has a baby anymore?  And I managed to convince some non-trivial amount of people that crops are bad and instead we’d eat “natural” crops like grass and weeds. Preposterous you might say. I’ll just say well buddy.

You’re thinking.. what debate? This is completely false. Well, that is exactly (I use the term very specifically here as there is no deviation) the same mental acrobatics that antivaxxers use. If you just refused vaccines and sat at home and kept your mouth shut, it’s not a huge deal. You’re pretty much only harming yourself (though in the case of COVID that’s at least partially false) and nobody else.

For comparison, 19000 people travelled across the Min street bridge per day in 2016, the most recent year a count was taken. So the First street bridge can easily take on the Monument Street traffic and not even match the amount of traffic crossing at Main, the busiest non-interstate bridge downtown…. I’m saying that with confidence because the First street bridge is actually wider than the Main Street bridge and would still handle less traffic. And the Main Street bridge was just rebuilt for its current traffic load within the past 5-10 years. So your initial concern you posted before about traffic, from what I can tell, is invalid",t2_fmjch,OHKID,0,1648940866.0,0,t1_i35vh9e,i35vh9e,False,EMTPirate,t3_tu7h03,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/tu7h03/improve_roads_and_services_no_40000000_pedestrian/,"Improve roads and services?

">in a way that posed no risk to the police, himself,

Who are you to say it posed no threat? The cop waited behind a door and waited for his partner and issued a Code 3 for a reason. Are you an expert in police techniques? Or are you just going by what you read on Reddit?

> what is necessary for the proper detention and securement of legally recognised targets. 

When you are dealing with a suspect during a **felony stop** who has been arrested for resisting arrest, having a weapon in a car, and domestic violence the second that person disobeys orders they are a danger to everyone including themselves.

How do you not understand that?

>The aim must be valid. Legal orders, etc.

In order to make an arrest, the suspect must have his hands freed. Do you really think a cop is going to let you keep holding your phone while beign arrested? Do you really think a cop is going to let you bring your phone to jail? If you do, you're more delusion than Sovereign Citizens.

>It's because he was holding what they clearly knew was a non weapon

1. It can be used as a weapon. When a cop arrests someone, they put their weapons away and are vulnerable.
2. It could be used as a mirror (the cops do not want him to know where they are at as they arrest him, that's why the cops have suspect face *away* when they cuff em).
3. As mentioned, if the suspect can't obey simple orders, then that suspect is unpredictable and desperate. You don't know what a desperate and unpredictable suspect is capable of.
4. What if the suspect put his arm out of view of the cop for a second, then when it came back in view he was still holding the phone? Do you think the cop is going to think it's a phone? Nope, he's getting *shot* (not tased) the second the cop sees that. It's not just for the cop's safety, but the suspect's as well.

> Tasing him, which is a dangerous procedure that can cause death if overused or with existing conditions, was not proportionate to his actions.

The cop had admirable restraint. Most cops would've asked him once to drop the phone, then told him to drop the phone, then force him to drop the phone. You should be praising the cop.

>He was holding the phone and not moving. 

He was ordered to drop the phone.

>without subjecting him to physical danger or extreme pain through tasing.

Or he could've dropped the phone and avoided this all together.

>I'm not willing to be pleased that he's still alive. Don't you deserve more from your law enforcement?

You need  to get off Reddit and quit letting it poison your mind. There's a weird trend in America where violent criminals are the real victims, and we shouldn't live in a civilized society because violent criminals should get away with it.

We live in a civilized society (allegedly). In a civilized society, you must obey authority. If a cop tells you to put the phone down during an arrest, **put the phone down.** We can't have a breakdown of society because you want some wife beating maniac not to get tased.",t2_mtzhc,OnlyFactsMatter,0,1648940055.0,0,t1_i35ttch,i35ttch,False,TrollyJamesTurner,t3_tt9sta,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/comments/tt9sta/this_happened_in_butler_county_any_updates_on/,This happened in Butler County.

Unfortunately for Oberlin, they weren't being sued for merely calling them racists, but stating that the bakery had a long history of racism and discrimination. They couldn't prove a long history of that, so they are liable for defamation. Also, their comments about what happened at the bakery in regards to this incident were plainly false, and they refused to walk them back or apologize after the students had pled guilty to the things the bakery accused them of.

"How is disobeying police orders (in a way that posed no risk to the police, himself, or any nearby persons) cause for physical violence by police *representing the authority of the government*?

State authorised violence needs to be purely functional - what is necessary for the proper detention and securement of legally recognised targets. The following rules of proportionality are not a legal code that this force follows, so don't bother telling me that he didn't have to adhere to them. I know that. I'm saying that morally and ethically, he should have. 

Proportionality and state violence

* The aim must be valid. Legal orders, etc. 

* The violence must be suitable for achieving that aim, and there cannot be a safer or less onerous way of achieving it. 

* Proportionality of aim - the aim sufficiently important to warrant violence

* Proportionality of response I - the violence should not be greater than the degree of resistance faced. 

* Proportionality of response II - the violence must not exceed the minimum amount of force needed to achieve the aim.


A man has outstanding warrants. That's *an* aim, and a very legitimate one. But that's not why there was violence. It's because he was holding what they clearly knew was a non weapon, for reasons that were clearly stated, and clearly a non threat.

* The aim of violence was to stop there from being a record of events independent of the police's. That's not legitimate.

* They tased him. Well, he certainly put the phone down, so I guess it's effective, but effective action for illegitimate aims is still wrong and disproportionate.

* He was hold a phone and standing still. Tasing him, which is a dangerous procedure that can cause death if overused or with existing conditions, was not proportionate to his actions.

"You're utterly projecting - as conservatives so often do. You *assume* that is how we would respond because that is how the majority of conservatives would. You expect us to be like you.

Most liberals and those who support the Dems are not like you. We have fundamentally different value systems and beliefs about what is acceptable from our politicians and how a society should work, but an innate part of that is a *fundamental belief in all having the same rights and innate worth*. We don't believe in the harsh ""social hierarchical"" model that so many conservatives do, where there are those who rise to the top - often through brutal, ""kill or be killed,"" ""survival of the fittest,"" ""winner take all"" means - who ""deserve"" most of the spoils and power and special privileges over those ""below"" them, who are seen as lesser and undeserving of a voice in how things work and who are forced to live by a different set of rules. Where real ""freedom"" comes without responsibility to others and is for those who perceive themselves to be ""worthy,"" but not those they see as ""below"" them. Which, by the way, is feudalism - not democracy. By and large, the overwhelming majority of us are not into ""power for power's sake,"" either. You see, we really do believe in democracy and in a collaborative society, even when that means that we have to compromise some with those who see the world differently, or that we even see as enemies, as long as those we are compromising with are not actively harming others in a major way. We may not like it, but we accept it as part of democracy, because it's hypocrisy not to. If we believe that each among us deserves a voice, that really does mean ***each***.

The evidence for that is in how we actively hold our politicians to a higher standard than conservatives do - not always as high a standard as we should, but higher. Dem politicians don't pull the shit that Republican ones do - like gerrymandering and voter suppression and all the unbelievable hypocrisy around refusing hearings on Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court, but then rushing to have hearings after RBG died, for just three of *innumerable* examples - because they know Dem voters would not tolerate it. Sure, we might fantasize about the kind of naked, fascistic power grabs that Republicans pull so that policies that we believe will be beneficial to society will finally get implemented, but the overwhelming majority of us would never actually go along with that because it violates our moral compass too much. So......even if Democratic politicians were to try to implement gerrymandering to protect their seats - which could easily happen because, you know....they ARE politicians - they would *quickly get checked by the majority of their voter base.*

"Not sure you want that either, by that standard you could have Columbus, Toledo, Cleveland & Cincinnati districts and the other 11 be reliably republican with each district having a lower percentage of isolated wrong party residents than you do now.

Ohio has never swung much over 60% Republican in the last 40 years.

The district level disenfranchisement has to be balanced with the state representation at the federal level on the whole.

"I agree with you, *up until the end of your statement*. Getting a few more democrats in congress won't change much in the *present moment/near future* for our personal situations, but.......it begins the slow process of shifting the Overton window back more toward the left, away from the extreme right position it's currently in. THAT, over time, WILL pay off, for the later part of your lives and for the lives of those who come after. If we don't think long-term and do the work for the future now, that window will just keep getting pulled further right - they won't stop. And if that happens, well......if we think it's bad now, we're in for an incomprehensible ass-fucking.

Just remember - younger generations are (rightfully) angry at boomers for having created/allowed the conditions that are making for such a difficult life for younger people who are left behind to deal with it. If younger folks (and older folks who are fighting for change) don't do what they can to start the process to fix this now - even if it doesn't pay off until later in life or for their kids - they are essentially doing the same to the generations who will come after them. I know it's harder now - boomers reaped the benefits of a pretty prosperous and stable time - and a lot of us won't be able to do much because of that, but we can't completely give up; we each need to do what we can. 

The wealthy/corporations have created conditions that are intended to simultaneously use up the life-force of the rest of us for their profits, and keep us so stressed and economically disadvantaged that we won't bother fighting - they're *counting* on that.

The reality of the situation is...we really cannot allow a few activists to pay attention for us anymore. And it might take some indirect and creative measures to make waves without getting DDT'd by Cop (whose getting screwed over alongside the rest of us).

Honestly, it'd probably be more effective to get all those people who would have showed up to a march to look up the donor lists for the politicians who can't draw a map and write those donors a few million letters asking them to sanction those politicians (by sanction I mean like, don't donate or attend their events) until they learn to make a map right.

This is why I’m saying that you are uneducated. It *is* figured out. There is no mystery here. If you were “educated” about it then why not get a “figured out” vaccine made by companies not using mRNA? I’ll wait.

"Realistically under the current regulations that would just draw similar legal challenges

You cannot have a district representative of it's constituents while also “prohibiting any district from primarily favoring one political party,” while requiring districts “to closely follow the statewide preferences of the voters.” without gerrymandering parts of greater Cleveland, Columbus Toledo and Cincinnati into every single district to offset the conservative voters.

The current process is also doesn't have any real deadlines for the end of legal challenges it doesn't have a real contingency for deadlock and no viable way to challenge the courts when the courts are misaligned with the voters.

There will never be a perfect answer to this but a process that is built on the assumption that everyone involved would ask in their own best interests would be more realistic instead of the idea that you could ever form a committee independent enough everyone would see them as neutral without bringing in people so uninformed as to make matters worse.

"> If your doctor told you to drink paint thinner to reduce the effects of covid, are you going to do it?

No because the doctor and I both know that the paint thinner would kill me. I know you think it’s cute, but the doctor would lose their license and go to jail for suggesting that. So it’s a really crappy comparison.

Aside from the fact that this highly transmissible disease is contagious and can cause great social harm, sure.

What exact question did I not answer? What are the exact words. Quote them.

> What's right for one person may not necessarily be right for the next. 

Which is why you ask your doctor and if you have some sort of underlying medical condition you can figure out a treatment plan from there.

Rejected. I’m not falling into this “country vs city” stuff.

Right and just know any software engineer, service professional and grocer who makes your life comfortable are probably not the backwards idiot that you are. But anyway, this is dumb because you can still make bad decisions and be an excellent plumber. Again, not getting drawn into this “us versus them” mentality that you have.

I know the business. They are someone selling a product, like any product. Roads, roundabouts, bridges. Their job is to convince the public servant to buy, some will do by hook-or-crook. Politicians need votes, they need money to get votes...

It most certainly is important for the public to know how these things come about so they can make sure there is scrutiny and their money not being wasted.

"> If your vaccinated, then why be concerned?

Because when medical professionals say go get vaccinated, morons pop into existence and start arguing against doing that. Notice how nobody outside of some fringe groups spent much time talking about things like the flu vaccine? I wouldn’t “be concerned” if people weren’t arguing against vaccines in the first place. We would all just listen to our doctors and that’s that. 

> ? I keep repeating its their choice because, people like yourself keep saying it's a dumb and irrational decision not to get the shot.

But what you’re saying isn’t a response to what I’m saying. Calling it dumb and irrational (and it is) has very little, if anything to do with making the choice. So when I say “this is dumb” and you say “it’s their choice” your response makes no sense. I didn’t say it wasn’t their choice. Of course it’s their choice. 

Calling the anti-vax perspective a “side” is giving it far more weight than what it’s worth. These aren’t like, idk, competing reasonable perspectives. It’s science and medicine, and then people who are either disingenuous, outright bad, or confused and uneducated. 

I will note also that calling someone uneducated isn’t a slur, you (or they) really are uneducated on the topic. I’m uneducated about lots of things. I have no idea how a car engine works. That’s why I hire a mechanic. You (and others) have no idea how vaccines work. That’s why you should listen to your educated doctor.

Aside from it is a least somewhat my concern, because a deadly pandemic affects me, and if someone gets sick they could get me sick, especially when they can mostly prevent it, we wouldn’t be having this conversation if people weren’t going around telling everyone that they aren’t getting vaccinated and that the vaccines are bad and scary or that COVID isn’t a big deal.

"You should look into amendments denied specifying that, for instance, discussion around something like family trees.  Teachers not allowed to comment on a student having two moms or dads while sharing that.  If a kid wants to talk about how their mom and dad got married, great!  But if a kid wants to share about their moms getting married, shut it down.  It’s completely okay for a teacher to have a picture of a heterosexual wedding day on their desk, but lgbtq+ ppl have to put theirs away now, because God forbid a child ask why there are two boys at the altar.  And why do you think we needed this bill?  Do you think early childhood teachers are out here showing porn in the classroom?  Like I’m confused.  It’s a stepping stone to build off of, to make them invisible again.  To make it abnormal to see people like them so it’s easier to convince the children later that it’s not normal to be gay.  

Teachers are taught and told what to teach.  They adhere to standards, they have more oversight from local and state bodies than most other professions, it’s not the Wild West.  Most states mandate that teachers have masters degrees to teach.  When you get that education, it’s tailored to the age ranges you are allowed to teach.

">  I'm neither for it or against the vaccine

No no. *Vaccines* plural. COVID-19 vaccine is no different than any other vaccine. Are you neither “for or against” bandaids and aspirin either? This isn’t an ideology except for people who make it out to be one. It’s just basic medicine.

> I've seen household that all but one wasn't vaccinated....and both vaccinated get fairly sick and the unvacinated hardly have a fever. 

So we call this anecdotal evidence. This is when a person has a personal experience or series of observations about a phenomenon. It’s a good data point, but it turns into a problem when you try to generalize your *own* experience to a population. For example, you may say “I’ve seen COVID cases and they aren’t that bad” or something similar. But then I could say “I’ve seen COVID cases and everyone I know who got the virus died from it”. But neither statement is equipped to generalize to a phenomenon. 

However we do have actual data and factual evidence. The facts, I.e. actual reality that’s undeniably true, show that getting a vaccine *significantly* reduces your likelihood of hospitalization or serious COVID symptoms” when compared with someone who has not been vaccinated. The reason that people are all but screaming for others to get vaccinated is because you are putting yourself at risk for no reason, and when we have a virus that’s as virulent as COVID (I.e. contagious and fast spreading) it overwhelms hospitals and medical support staff, puts people who may be more vulnerable to COVID infections, and others at risk. It’s not a big deal today. I don’t wear a mask and I go to bars and restaurants and live my life normally, but when we are/were at gigantic COVID spikes it was causing a serious problem. 

Nobody is *forcing* you to get a vaccine. What’s outrageous and irritating is that people have gotten all worked up about what amounts to just basic, everyday science. We know and understand how vaccines work. We’ve developed vaccines for decades. There isn’t *any* rational reason to not get one excluding medical circumstances which you can discuss with your doctor. The reason people don’t *respect* your decision is because it’s stupid, and childish. Neither I nor anyone else will respect this decision just as I wouldn’t respect an adult telling me that the tooth fairy is real or that they should take out high interest loans to gamble at a casino with. This whole “the media fed us this crap blah blah blah” is completely irrelevant, and it’s just a psychological defense mechanism you’ve created from being inundated with the very media you seem to be upset about except that you’re putting your health at risk. 

It is well known that American and western adversaries have run disinformation campaigns to create vaccine hesitancy and sow fear, uncertainty, and doubt. It’s not just sad but troubling that some were so ready to throw out the advice and training of medical professionals because of some bloggers and a few well-timed Facebook ads. You’re being had.

You keep repeating “it’s their choice”. Yes. Why do you keep repeating that? Nobody is suggesting that it’s not your choice. But nobody has to respect bad choices. The problem is “respect my choice” has become “respect my choice and by the way don’t get a vaccine”. If you were just sitting at home and keeping it to yourself because you’ve decided to make bad decisions that’s one thing. But when people such as yourself who do not know what they’re talking about go around and start talking, you start convincing other people to make the same dumb decision that you have. That’s a problem. Why? Because people literally die from listening to your uneducated thoughts and “opinions” on this topic. Do you go around telling cancer patients to drink orange juice and get vitamin C because of some random blog you found? Why the hell do you think this is any different?

“Wahhh why are you calling me uneducated that’s not fair!?!?” Because you *are* uneducated about this topic and it is fucking up the lives of other people. There is one person who is educated about this topic. Your doctor. That’s the only person you need to listen to. If they say get a vaccine, get a vaccine. If they say “take this pill to cure this disease you have” you never hesitate to take it so you?

"I take it that was your opinion in 2019 too? Vaccines are *scary*? Nobody is *making* anyone get vaccinated. We’re pointing out the absolutely asinine rhetoric that just popped into existence around COVID as if it’s somehow different than all the other vaccines you’ve taken. (Spoiler - it’s not. Your opinion that it is was bought and paid for buy Chinese, Iranian, and Russian troll farms) 

I don’t know what happened to Americans where all of a sudden their ability to understand risk just went out the window. Maybe it’s the lack of education in math and science. Idk.

Those who don’t get vaccinated are far more likely to get sick and die, so the gene pool just shrinks naturally.

"Depends on your definition of reasonable driving time and the level of rugged you feel like being. I personally like Archer's Fork near Marrietta. It's 2 hours from Canton and is a 14 mile loop a good deal more remote than anywhere you'll find in northeast Ohio, and feels more adventurous with the river crossings, especially during the spring when the water levels are highest.

Also in the ""worth the drive"" category but more forgiving is Mill Creek in Youngstown.

Beyond that for closer to most people in northeast Ohio is the Cuyahoga Valley. I personally like the Perkins Trail because it feels more remote than most of the others, although the Virginia-Kendall Ledges are really neat.

But for ledges the neatest is Nelson Ledges, out past to the Ravenna/Kent area (disclaimer, my orientation is I'm a little bit south of Akron).
