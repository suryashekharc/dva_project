Several kayak rental places along the river.

Several good coffee shops and new eateries…. Something new almost every month.  Elm Street has undergone redevelopment … and is still developing as a “to do”.

That, or a bookstore like Fabled. Hang out in a section Of books that interest you and strike up a convo when someone grabs a book you know and like.

"How can you end homelessness when the majority of them don't want a true home.  They want freedom of society, freedom from responsibilities.   Also the more shelters you build, the more beds you make, the more you let them make hundreds of dollars on the street corners every day......the more attractiveness the city will be to people that shun their responsibilities in society. You see this play out when cities make it easier to be homeless, people will come to that city from far away.  San Francisco is a great example...San Antonio also.  You drive around  there and you will see tents and mattress on the street, under bridges next to major intersections.

Also the government and NGOs inflates the number count as to receive more money and have a bigger issue and  platform.

"> find temporary housing

Find *permanent* housing. 

I know nobody ever wants to consider it, but *public housing* should be an option. If you want, you can restrict new entries to people currently, regularly, utilizing an available homeless shelter as their primary address and you can recoup some costs by making rent percentage-of-income based after 6 months or so. I'm concerned that the plan, as-is, is going to exist solely to funnel tax dollars into landlords' pockets.

"40-something, white, married guy with two teens, and I'm not really religious.
1) Small town but big enough to have some 'big city' perks
2) Honestly it's not a bad town to live in - can't think of much negative that most town's done have. I grew-up here and would answer this quite differently 10-15 years ago.
3) Cameron Park and zoo, lots of youth programs for kids and families to get involved with like Scouts, amazing library system and programs
4) Waco is very diverse, there are active groups from left to right of the spectrum.  
5) Far too many to name.  Fable Books, Schmaltz Sandwich, Dichotomy Coffee, Pinewood Coffee, Clay Pot, Spice, Alpha and Omega, the list goes on with local restaurants, cafes, and shops.  My family shops local every chance we get...and there are plenty of places to pick from in Waco.  Not to mention an amazing farmers market downtown on Saturdays.

For schools, I saw one of your posts that you homeschool.  Though Waco has a strong public school network it leaves lots to be desired.  If you did want to look at schools I'd suggest at least touring some of them, Waco Montessori or St. Pauls for younger, Vanguard for older, or maybe Valor which is a home school/in class mix.  Lots of options on this front, and most to all offer scholarships and assistance.  And Waco has a very strong Scouts BSA program from K to 12, many units to pick from, and the entire family can participate, even the adults!

"I lived in this complex a little over 15 years ago when I was in college. It is hands down the worst place I have ever lived.

We lived in a downstairs unit that didn't have locks on the windows. They literally jammed a spoon in the window and told us it was secure. Mice and roaches no matter how much we cleaned. We kept almost no food in the apartment, and food we did have was kept in the fridge or microwave. The roof leaked and the water went down the wall into out rooms and flooded up through the carpet, ruining clothes and textbooks. Mold everywhere.

When we moved out, we discovered the complex had returned our deposit to someone else, shrugged, and told us not their problem. Then sent a bill for hundreds of dollars of stuff they claimed we needed to pay for, but wouldn't give us an itemized bill, just a number they said we had to pay. We tried calling their corporate office, no luck. We finally had to get our parents involved to help us because we were way in over our heads. My parents threatened to get a lawyer involved and magically they had made a mistake and sent us the wrong bill when we moved out.

Ohhhhh, I almost forgot: we almost didn't get to move into the unit we had signed a lease for because someone had broken in and was using it for drugs or something. The complex barely fixed the door and just left all of the crap inside for us to deal with when we moved in. Then, after living there for a few months, I came home from work to find the police walking down the stairs in my building with a battering ram because the people upstairs were making drugs in their apartment. Police told me to go inside, lock the door, and not come out. When someone was stabbed to death in the parking lot, we decided to move, cheap rent be damned. I skipped meals so I could afford to live anywhere else.

ETA: I'm assuming they're still super shady (I think they were under DTI when I lived there, too) and just looking to kick out people on leases so they can jack up the prices for new tenants in this housing market.

My home is 2200 square feet with 2 bedrooms and bathrooms downstairs,and then my 2 sons at home have domain of the 2 upstairs bedrooms & bathroom, and I never have to look at their rooms! It seemed like such a waste blowing cold air up there when they're gone all of the time! I bought 4 window units, and we shut the 2 upstairs ones off when my sons aren't upstairs. We are on an electric plan now, where each month they average the bill from the past 12 months, so it's  very similar amount every month: around $125-150!! I have a friend who moved from SoCal less than 6 months ago to China Springs. She was my middle son's 2nd grade teacher, and she knew school wasn't challenging my son at all, and she implemented an individual teaching plan for him: people like that are few and far between! She is home schooling her 3 children now. I think 1 is middle school and 2 are primary. She is so motivated! She would be a great resource and friend for you! I think she's in a group that go on field trips together and may collaborate on other things. I know that she is inspired by Charlotte Mason.
 Also, are you going to rent or buy? I wanted to buy, but needed a short-term rental while we found our home. This realtor that mostly dealt with Baylor students really was able to help me. So they work with Baylor students who want to rent for 9 months, then have the 3 summer months with no obligation. So, if you're coming in May, you can get a 3 month rental or if apartments aren't rented by the end of September, you're in a good position to get a month by month rental. So anyway, the condos that are specifically marketed for college students can be a great deal if you are just looking for a month by month or a short-term rental.

"I disagree with this, I'm a native Wacoan and the food scene here 10 years ago was abysmal, we have a ton of great restaurants, bars, coffee shops now these days.   


For coffee, Pinewood is my number one spot, but Dichotomy also has great coffee.  


Pizza, either Moroso, but for something less fancy, I'd get Shorty's pizza. Southern roots brewery also has great pizza I hear.  


For global cuisine, I really love Curry up and Wok this way for Thai food,   
Saffron for Indian, Alpha Omega for Greek, and of course there will be seemingly endless options for Mexican food, but I personally love La Milpa and Las Trancas for street tacos.

"Sorry, I don't have time to answer all of your questions, but I'll address education.
We moved from SoCal to Waco 6 years ago. The Waco ISD is seriously worse than I could have ever, ever imagined. They do have a great charter school: Rapaport Academy (K-6) that goes by lottery for your eldest & then all of your younger children are also in.. Living in the part of Waco that is in the Midway ISD is an option. That is a good ISD. Reicher Catholic School is the equivalent of Waco ISD with a uniform.
 If you are in a position to put your kids in EXCELLENT prep schools (+/- 14,000 a year...a drop in the bucket having come from $38,000/year at Francis Parker in San Diego,)  there are 2 excellent ones. My kids didn't/don't attend Live Oak Classical School, as when we moved here, the upper & middle school grades were still growing, but were yet to have a robust experience, as the upper grades were growing as the lower ones matriculated. I hear it is an excellent school with a classical education, & they now have K-12. 
My teens/tweens who still were not yet in college attended or are attending Vanguard College Prep (7-12). It is a great school! Great STEM, great Art department, great after school clubs and activities, great sports & excellent coaches. My middle son is so into STEM, engineering, astrophysics, robotics, etc. and they let him stay an hour or two late to work on his own coding platform, as well as using their 3D printer. He got into his first choice university. It's hard to follow him as a younger sibling , but my others are also thriving.
There are a few other private schools that have been here for some time. There are a number of private schools that were not here 6 years ago. I don't know, but they seem to have popped up with the increasing population. That may be good and noble. I don't know their reputations or if they can rise to their potential, being so new.
 We should have social gatherings for all the CA transplants! We could also have a list of what we miss/don't miss since moving from CA to Waco. Mine would be that I miss the ocean and don't miss the traffic, gas prices, and utility prices. Property taxes are higher here, especially factoring in the lower wages in comparison to CA.

"Hi! I’m a Hispanic 22 yo Female, libertarian Christian raised here in Waco since birth. I grew up in the suburb of Hewitt. 

1. Best parts of Waco- we don’t feel as economically punched in the face as other places, even though it is catching up with us. Waco was a small town when I was 12 in 2013, so the growth has been quick and stability is probably not the best, but it could be worse. Waco is really easy to navigate and you can drive from one suburb in the north to another in the south within 20 min. There are lots of new store, activities, and events that pop up all the time. We have an amazing community college here and I’m a proud alumni! We also have great job opportunities for college grads in certain areas. It’s a very safe area for what most people are used to. 

2. Worst of Waco: Waco has a housing crisis bc of people buying houses not worth their value just for the Magnolia factor. Waco has a homelessness crisis, we lack effective mental health care for criminals and in turn downtown is a petting zoo of crackheads and drug dealers. Downtown is super cool during the day, but many times there are people who need genuine mental health services who have no where to go and they end up in that area to rest. We have a great PD, And our local government is decent, it’s just not prepared for the influx of problems we have at the moment. Waco can be very polarizing due to the toxic Christianity that exists, but for the most part I’ve been able to find a community of people who respect views, listen and value people for their humanity. 

3. Best family activities: I’ve worked with kids all my life and Waco is the best place to have kids! The mayborn museum is fun and educational. The Cameron park zoo has been one of Waco’s biggest brag points, they really take care of the animals and do an amazing job at creating a fun and educational environment. There are also kid gyms, laser tag, roller skating, the family YMCA, karate, gymnastics, a skate park that Tony Hawk has visited twice recently, lots of regular public parks around the city, Hawaiian falls (water park), Waco wet lands, escape rooms, the farmers market, the flea market, putt putt, urban air (jumping place), dr. Pepper museum, paintball facility and many other small business that offer dance lessons, crafting services and fine arts lessons. 

4. Cultural Climate: Waco is very friendly, conservative and welcoming. I’ve always been able to make a friend when I was out and about and I’ve felt like this City has treated me decently fairly. Now, as a POC woman, I have struggled with some jobs and life events in this city that have made me question of there isn’t some underlying racism or misogyny that’s still in the culture here, but I think that’s also a generational trait as many of those experiences were with people 40+. This city is a developing city that seems to be headed in the right direction, but it is fragile. If we are not careful with how we interact with our local government and community, we could easily push this city to be another Austin or LA or Seattle with a headache of contradicting policies. Racially, the climate is white. We do have lots of Hispanic and black representation, but for the most part it is still a predominantly white city. There are more people who are becoming aware of this representation though. 

5. Best Waco businesses: there are lots, but here are my frequently visited places. All are locally opened and operated. 

1. Saffron Indian restaurant 
2. Game closet
3. Mac House & Pops Lemonade
4. Koko Ramen
5. Waco Rage Room
6. True Love bar 
7. Waco farmers market: most businesses are small, local and offer great goods and services!

"We chose Waco for the family friendly atmosphere. The Maybourne children’s museum is on Baylor Campus next to the law school and it is GREAT for kids. Consider getting a family pass there if you decide to go often- you will save money and the pass gets you discounts to similar museums all over the country.

The Cameron Park Zoo is also terrific for kids. It’s best to go in the mornings when the animals are active. I’ve been to many zoos and this one is special. 

Consider living in Hewitt or Woodway- they are suburbs just to the south of Waco. They are a little quieter, safer, are developing, and will have lots of families with kids. 

I’m a Conservative WASP, but not everyone there is. The east side of Waco is a college town, so you have people from all over, but Baylor is a Baptist university so the student base will lean religious.

If you like burgers you have to try Captain Bill Whizbangs. Union Hall, In downtown Waco, is a food court that has a lot of local eateries with booths- the only downside is it’s hard to find parking. There’s a great small bookstore right by, but the name is escaping me. (Edit: it’s called Fabled)

Try Dirt Cheap at some point- it’s the kind of place that sells everything Marshall’s and Ross couldn’t sell, so it’s always an adventure. 

The worst part is the road construction along I-35. Try to avoid it if you can- it’s usually not bad but you could get stuck in an unexpected traffic jam.",t2_13nngf,HoodooSquad,0,1647462168.0,0,t1_i0xgoso,i0xgoso,True,shesplantobsessed,t3_tfmwf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waco/comments/tfmwf6/relocating_to_waco/,Relocating to Waco,/r/Waco/comments/tfmwf6/relocating_to_waco/i0xgoso/,3,r/Waco,0,3

"1. Definitely being in central texas! Were just a few hours from DFW, Houston, Austin, San Antonio- and in the summers you can still take trips to the beach! (but it is on the gulf of mexico lol very different from Cali beaches)
2. Ive lived here my entire life and personally, think Waco is lacking on activities and things to do around town. Maybe ive just done everything in my years here lol! To be fair Waco is on the come up with tons of new businesses and locations opening! The biggest setback for me is there are no large concert venues. As someone who loves live music, i wish we had a large venue to accommodate larger musicians. (We always end up traveling to Austin or Dallas) Of course there are a few cool local spots that will have live music but not quite my style lol- The Backyard is a pretty popular bar downtown that often has live music playing!
3. CAMERON PARK!!! Theres tons of trails and its just a beautiful park in general to spend some time outdoors! If you are considering the Hewitt/ Woodway location, Woodway Park is another great spot that sits on Lake Waco! Theres a few museums around, as well as the zoo!
4. Definitely very southern, Texas hospitality in general! I would say most people are right leaning, so probablyyy dont mention you moved here from California lol! (But good for you!! I hope you love Texas and find a home here <3)
5. Idk if these are all technically small businesses, but they feel more local i guess! 
-Food: Slow Rise, Shortys, Union Hall, La Salle Food Truck Park, Health Camp, Hey Sugar, Cafe Cappucino
-Coffee/Drinks: Common Grounds, Barnetts, Dichotomy
-Shopping: Spice Village, Fabled bookshop, tons of Antique stores on La Salle, theres also a Flea Market i think weekly, Farmers Market

"I have lived in waco my entire life other than college.
Early 40s/Caucasian/Male /Atheist 

1.  The only good part about Waco is that up until recent years was very cheap because the majority of people who live here live below poverty line.  Waco has historically been one of the poorest parts of Central Texas  

2.  The worst part of Waco is the the violence is returning in force.  The city I grew up in was wild and kids did not play outside after dark in most of the city limits and its getting back to that.  You routinely hear people how unsafe it feels around here all the sudden and that just shows people who grew up here that you did not.  Waco is the wild west and the crooks are back to take all the fool fold people think they can find here.

For the other stuff there are plenty of things to do in waco for kids.  We have the largest municipal parkin the entire nation (yes larger than Central Park in NYC) and the largest lake inside of any city limits in the state and top 5 in the nation.  For local business there are lots to choose from but almost all of them come in the form of restaurants which there are tons.

The biggest thing you will find is McClennan is one of the most conservative counties in the state.  Basically you are hard to the right or you keep your opinions to yourself unless you enjoy pissing off alot of your neighbors.  If you have good money or make good money Waco is great as long as you stick to your area.  If your religious you best chance to socialiE is find a church and become an active person in said church.

Final note, the cost of living is cheaper but if you think you will find a good paying job all i can say is good luck.  I'm extremely luck I have a job that pays over 50k a year and of my entire friend group I'm and by far and away the best paid member of it.  Most jobs in waco are considered good pay if they pay you 36k+ a year.

"I’m a mid twenties white woman, originally from a big city suburb on the east coast. I’m not very religious but have a Christian background. I relocated here a few years ago.

1 - I like the slower pace around here and small city size. There’s enough amenities to feel comfortable without all the drawbacks of truly big cities.

2 - the recent cost of living jump has been extremely painful for me, wages aren’t caught up. Also I’m annoyed by the construction and bad drivers (but that’s all of Texas haha)

3 - we have tons of stuff for families here! I feel like Waco is very kid friendly. The mayborn is a great museum and our zoo is nice. I don’t have kids, but I’m sure there’s more.

4 - culturally pretty conservative but very kind overall. I do feel like I have to fake being more religious to be accepted, but that’s probably on me for not making a better effort to meet more likeminded people.

"Maybe I can give some insight as someone who is new, and moved here in November. Late 20s, male, Atheist, Libertarian. I've lived in Texas my entire life, but in smaller towns north of here. I lived in a town where you pretty much had to commute 40 mins to an hour just to find somewhere to make decent money. I moved to the China Spring area, and I'm loving having everything you need here, but still living a little bit outside of it. My 20 minute commute has been amazing.

1. So far, the best part to me is having everything here, but still not being the size of Ft Worth or Dallas. Living where I did before, I frequented Ft Worth more than Waco, and traffic here isn't near as bad. 
2. Worst parts, I'm not sure. I moved here at what I'm guessing was a bad time due to housing. There are rough parts of town, but I've been to the worst parts of DFW, and I'd say this isn't as bad. 
3. The zoo is great, I've been bringing my daughter to this one since before we moved here. The Mayborn Museum is also an amazing place to take the kids. The various walking and bicycle trails are great as well, my daughter and I frequently ride our bikes on them. There are no shortage of parks. Restaurants have been hit and miss. Locals shit on it, but we love Buzzard Billy's; my daughter loves the gator tail. 
4. Cultural climate is more diverse than where I'm from, but being from rural areas that doesn't count for much.

">1. Best parts of living in Waco
2. Worst parts of living in Waco
3. Best family things to do (we have 3 kids)
4. Overall cultural climate
5. The best small businesses

I was born in Waco, left when I was 21 for Austin, lived in AR for a while and came back. I came back because AR is poor and only like five people are making any money there. I would describe myself as republican but I'm in my mid 40's and I'd rather discuss individual issues than anything along party lines. I make a comfortable living in Waco but live 30 min away on 10 acres where I can work on cars and do what I want without being hassled by neighbors or an HOA. Built a house for $98/sqft about 10 years ago to a good spec. It's worth quite a bit more than that now. Cars are older but paid for, I carry no debt other than the mortgage. 

Best part.. I would say the size. Traffic is not bad like Austin. Big enough to have pretty much anything my family wants. I have a good social life with a lot of real friends. 

Worst part.. the gun violence in the middle of town is getting out of hand. If you are waking around at night in Waco there is a good chance you are going to hear gunshots from people shooting randomly at stop signs or at another drug dealers house.  We have a good police force but they are getting more and more restricted every year. This is the trend in the whole country though, not just Waco. The citizens support the police. 

Best family things to do are going out to eat, movies, Cameron park, lake Waco, suspension bridge walk, biking across the Dam. There are some museums and such that are good for once or twice visits. 

Overall climate I would describe as typical southern hospitality. People generally work for a living, expect to pay taxes and expect good service. They don't want a lot of intrusion in their lives or to be told what to do. I would say most people feel that you get what you give, or you will have what you earn. Texas is more like another country than another state to me. When I visited Germany I told everyone I was from Texas not the USA.

"I’ve lived in and around Waco most of my life. I’m in my mid 20’s so maybe I can give a younger perspective of things.

All my pre-adult life I wanted to leave this city for numerous reasons. Didn’t think there was much to do, the town itself seemed very shallow (don’t go to Cameron park after dark was one I got a lot) and I just wanted something new. I became an adult went into the navy and saw the world (16 countries outside US, 5 continents, and many cities) yet when I thought where I wanted to live my life I came back to Waco with my wife.

My wife isn’t Caucasian and is from New York City. She was very scared moving here because the cultural differences are very different than she was used to. A little bit away for me is about 30 minute drive compared to her block over to name something.

People have been nothing but nice to my wife and we have never had any incident with racism. My rent is 735 a month for a 3 bedroom place with a big fenced backyard and a front yard with a porch and gazebo. We both have wonderful jobs as well. 

I’m not saying this to rub it in, but maybe you’re looking in all the wrong places? It’s possible to enjoy this city. But you have to enjoy it for what it is. It’s not Austin it’s not New York and I’m glad it isn’t. Our downtown has gained a lot of remodeling and it may not look it but it’s becoming better.

As for things to do, you got me. To be honest taking my wife to see Waco has been interesting because all the same old zoo, museums, and stuff were the same things I grew up with but that doesn’t mean we don’t have a lot. We have a farmer’s market, social clubs (something I never thought I’d see in Waco) a zoo, two museums that are big, and actually a lot more. Maybe you should ask yourself what you enjoy doing and find likeminded people that can help with your search.

"> The Caucasian residents have prejudice against the black and brown community,

I can't speak to this personally, as I'm white, but I can say that I don't treat others like this. I have no doubt that you've probably experienced this prejudice from assholes in and from around Waco. I just ask that you don't generalize entire communities when communicating your experience.

> no one wants to update the cosmetics of the city,

This depends on what part of the city you're referring to. Downtown Waco, the Silos, certain areas around Baylor, and even East Waco (across the Brazos from downtown) have been in the constant process of updating. The problem is it's mostly updates for tourists and not the local community.

> no activities

There's plenty of activities. Cameron Park and Brazos Park East for walking, hiking, biking, and disk golf. Top golf and other golf courses (Lake Waco, Cottonwood, etc). Cinemark for movies. Main Event opens next month. Various bars/breweries that host events like trivia nights. Extraco Events center hosts stuff like the HOT fair and rodeo, concerts, the margarita and salsa fest. Etc, etc..

They shouldn't have any kind of need to look through your windows. There's nothing they do that requires it when it comes to appraisals. Maybe if it's a new build or some major renovation so they can classify it properly.  They may come out to your property and eyeball it. They usually stay at the edge of the property and just look. They have aerial photos and Google earth and stuff for most of what they do. We updated our ag appraisal recently and apparently that guy just came and looked from the street.

"That assumption is probably correct, though I still wouldn't let them in. I want to say it's based more on building type, square footage, and average area values rather than what kind of fixtures, etc you have inside. So if they need to know anything about the interior itd be more along the lines of if it's finished out or just a big empty space with no walls (like a shed). They never went in the shop. Never saw anyone come out to the house. My best guess is they caught it with sattelite imagery/osm data and were fairly accurate with size and construction material as well.

I like going to read in public too because people tend to leave you be but also are still friendly and could give you an in for a conversation. Dichotomy, Barnes and Nobel, Fable, woodway park are all great places to chill out. If you’re artsy, central Texas art collective has events and they have other meetings for art shows etc. You also have lots of volunteer groups in Waco if that’s your thing!

A year or so ago, I found the best option was PODS.  You can rent a U-Haul to haul your vehicle and bring along what you want immediately, then PODS will charge you a monthly fee for whatever you have in their boxes.  

Possibly cheapest would be moving it all in a large U-Haul, unloading into a storage unit there, and then moving it again when you are ready to unload.

Another interesting option is buying a shipping container, around $3K, and storing your stuff in it.  Maybe you want something like that long term on the east coast?

You realize that there is 0% of your taxes allocated to “take care of you”, yeah? Nada, zip, zero. The government provides services to its citizens out of necessity, not altruism. Locally, citizens themselves vote on tax rate increases that are allocated for specific reasons which is literally the government asking “WOULD YOU LIKE TO PAYFOR THIS SERVICE?” So, please stop saying “take care of me”, because unless you’re talking about a Euro country, it doesn’t make sense. You pay for everything you receive. This is not a social welfare government.  “Take care of me” only happens whe. You pay really, really high taxes in another country. 

For better or worse, there has never been tax rates setup to benefit those who don’t contribute. Medicare/Medicaid could have done the trick, but there is a reason the government differentiates between those who can work but don’t, and those that can’t work and don’t.  That’s why so many people love the AOCs and Bernies, because the offer some aspects of “take care of me even though I don’t contribute”.",t2_9tr74,noexcuse4me,0,1646475142.0,0,t1_hzfqqlq,hzfqqlq,False,TTLAAJ,t3_t6ve3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waco/comments/t6ve3j/waco_working_on_plan_to_prevent_possibly_end/,"Waco working on plan to prevent, possibly end homelessness in the area",/r/Waco/comments/t6ve3j/waco_working_on_plan_to_prevent_possibly_end/hzfqqlq/,-6,r/Waco,0,-6
"We need to be PRAYING for answers on this for our city. Former homeless gal here - addiction, mental health, domestic violence. There was help (and hope) in Waco. Attended MCC - went from gas station clerk to nurse. Education means opportunity. Left the abusive marriage, but didn't fair so well on my own and ended up homeless. After rehab, it only made sense to come back to Waco. MHMR, public transportation and community (AA, sober living, outreach programs, Salvation Army) shoot even probation here was helpful.

One day is also a nice quiet vibe, and lastly Stay Classy has a relaxing atmosphere and they usually have live music and other events every week, though they are very wine-specific, so if you like wine, that's the place to go.

" > Deanie Bishop Parrish, a Waco resident born in Florida who earned her wings flying missions during World War II, died Thursday, one day before family and friends were to celebrate her 100th birthday.

No. We aren’t proud of them because it is a massively horrific and gentrifying eye sore for our town.

"Please do NOT go to Homestead Heritage. They’re awful people who hide their abusive tendencies in their religious beliefs. Magnolia isn’t worth going to. It’s overpriced and the items are just marked up Chinese bulk buy items. Local owed shops are better, fairly priced and they’re way more fun to tour. Below are my favorite things to do and places to eat as a lifetime local who cares about her small town business owners. 

Food:
The Mac House- great former Mac n cheese, grilled cheese and Pops lemonade. 

Taqueria Zacatecas- best cabeza tacos in town! But tbh, any place besides Hecho en Waco Is pretty dope. 
Waco knows how to do texmex. 

Saffron- amazing Indian food owned by a local family. Their butter chicken is amazing but their lamb bhuna is my favorite. 

HTK BBQ- local BBQ fusion with International flair. My partner worked with the guy who owns it, amazing place to support. 

Katie’s custard- great local place for some crazy delicious icecream! They also sell dope frito pies and hot dogs. 

Salty dogs- bar and grill type place with really cool former hot dog options. 

Schmaltz- is a Waco local legend! These sandwiches are unlike anything else and you HAVE to stop and get a cup of their cheese soup. 

Hey sugar- is a local retro candy store that sells ice cream and candy by the lb! They have lots of fun novelties to try. 

Activities:

Cameron park Zoo- our zoo is so special and has been a huge part of our town for decades. You will have a blast at the zoo, even if you’re two adults looking to waste some time. 

Cameron Park Disk Golf- our disk golf locations are so gorgeous and right by the river for some beautiful views. 

Waco Paddle Co- kayaking on the Brazos is a must if you’re going to be here when it’s warm enough! 

Bicycle world- located downtown close to the suspension bridge (another cool local spot) you can rent bikes and explore our downtown area! 

Axe throwing- Waco Axe Co is so fun and you can sent an hour of space to throw axes and channel your inner barbarian. They even have a bar. 

Waco Rage Room- you can pay to swing a bat at an old tv, what more should I even have to say. It’s a great stress reliever 

Waco Escape Rooms- our escape rooms are very fun and usually not too booked up. 

Waco Farmers Market- a great place to support local farmers and artisans. They also have food trucks and food stands and most places are delicious. This is open on Saturday mornings from 8-3. I would double check the times because sometimes events change the times and location. 

Waco Flea Market- sat. And Sundays from 7-4 te flea market is a great place to find antiques, Mexican goods and cool antique finds. 

Gaming locations: 
Nexus, The Game Closet And Kings Landing are all fun places to stop by and play board games and video games, hang out and grab a bite to eat. Kings landing has a cafe in it called Butter my Biscuit and it is delicious! their biscuits are some of the best in town. 

If you’re needing some bar locations or night life suggestions:

True love
melody ranch
Barnetts 
Sloanes
