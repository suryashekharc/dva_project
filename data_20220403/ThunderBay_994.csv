"Still no eSIM... And they have an arguably inferior network, likely due to over subscription sure, but inferior none the less. 

And before you come at me with ""my cousin's uncle's cat says Bell sucks at their house 3 hours down a back road has Tbaytel service but no bell"", absolutely both networks are far from perfect, but; Bell's network actually has 5G already in the city, every single tower has LTE on it, their rural LTE is 700MHz so it goes farther than Tbaytel's 850MHz, and I know quite a few places that Bell works and Tbaytel doesn't at all, talking middle of Murillo between Oliver and Highway, or Slate River just 5 minutes off the highway. 

I need to be hyper connected for work, so I have an American AT&T SIM I use for Data ($55/month for actually unlimited data, no slow downs - works on Bell and Rogers networks) but I also have a PhoneBox eSIM for my Canadian number, it runs on Rogers but has access to their extended network so roams on Bell when Tbaytel's network doesn't reach. I see the Rogers-EXT show up more than it should for ""Northwestern Ontario's Best Carrier"" or whatever their billboards say. 

They give dividends to the city, and that's great. They are delivering true Fibre to your house and that's cool too. But I get a chuckle every time I see a new announcement about how they just livened up a new tower with LTE, yet when Bell went from 3G to LTE they basically upgraded every tower in the area on the same day and didn't make an announcement over it. Or Bell recently launched 5G here, when a lot of Tbaytel's network is still 3G/HSPA still.

Bit of a rant, sorry! But everything I said is true!

"I was looking at upgrading my phone plan because I've been paying ~$55 for 3GB for a while now, as I wasn't going out much. I've heard rumours of something called ""Spring"", so I expect I will be out and about more. These unlimted plans give you high speed data for the first 20GB (or more depending on your plan), then they switch to 512kbps afterwards. Plans start at $75/month. 

I've been disappointed with the lack of decent data prices from TBayTel and the lack of an unlimited plan. This puts them in line with other major carriers.

"Thank you.

Yeah I like the idea that I can make something tangible from out of my mind. I don't own a 3D printer but the owner of Community Spokes has opened a computer gaming lab and DIY electronics space and mentioned he's wanting to invest in a good 3D printer, since I'm going back to volunteering there full time for the cycling season I figured one of these days I'll pitch the idea of helping people learn 3D modeling for art or CAD to do 3D printing and such.

It's been my dream since this winter to secure some kind of funding grant to supply all that's needed for the computer lab to have a fully operational DIY 3D space for modeling and printing, or just somewhere those who don't have the means can come do art work free of charge with assistance if needed. He's got the space, I got a reasonable understanding of the rest.

I've slowly lost full use of my hands so I lost the ability to play with clay like I used to for creative purposes. I can imagine there's plenty of people out there that may be in the same boat, can't do art like they used to. With what I've set up for myself I can again and that's something I would want to offer to anyone.

"First picture there is something I started last night, I modeled 50 unique skeletons that will be used when this is done. Here's the same image with more generous lighting, https://imgur.com/lrNRMxE

Image two was from when I was first starting out and wanted to play with transparent materials. It's a horse made of glass, wrapped in glass, with a glass skeleton inside and a light emitting heart.

Third is a project I started but still need to finish. I like Warhammer 40K and I wanted to make a large chaos terminator statue for 3D printing. Claw arm nearly done, then like 90% of the rest to go, fuckin ADHD.Fourth  was trying my hand at rigging and animation. I made a doggo, made him a helmet which I think is cool. I made an old shitty wooden bucket, he wears it upside down with a candle on the top cause he's afraid of the dark.

The BPP ring I made to bug Onur with because I was bored.

"If you're looking to do groceries on the cheap because you're broke and food is expensive then go the same route I did when I was still employed/not completely destitute.

I stopped looking at things from a product view and started looking at them from dollar per macronutrient. It's not a great way to live but when you're broke, if you're broke then it makes all the difference in the world.

Fat and protein. For my dollar I couldn't beat the store made italian sausage packs at Renco Court Street. Extremely fatty but I mean, animal fats eh? If you can handle the nitrates and such they also do their ""assorted meat ends"" packages beside the deli meats. Random assortments of stuff, sometimes you can get a big fuckin pack of pancetta for next to nothing.  Then alongside all of this they had the best damn deal on pork loins in town. Roast one of them up and you've got a ton of protein and fat for next to nothin. Prices have gone up but I'm sure on these particular fronts they're still the cheapest. Sometimes they got brussels sprouts for 50-90 cents per package too.

So yeah, had to give up the idea of pork, beef, chicken etc. Just thought of it as protein and fat. Then when I wanted to bulk up the protein amount I'd make a complete protein with beans and rice. Carbohydrates in there as well. The nice thing about changing this mindset is that you start to look at the value of food differently.

Sure, that X, Y or Z product on the shelf looks tasty, your brain wants it.. but what value is it in terms of your macronutrients? Say you look at some Pizza Pops, 4 pack not on sale. Around $3.99 and the entire box comes to 24g protein, 132g carbohydrates Of which only 12g is fiber and 24g is sugar and then 48g of fat, 10g of which is saturated. Most people eat two per serving or all four, so.. Fuck that. For a $2 more you can get around 2kg of white rice and 1kg of black beans. So for around $6 you get 321g protein, carbohydrates over 1600g, fat's only 13.5g but that's where you add in some fried up cheap meat. The best thing about beans and rice is you can add anything to it and it works. 2kg of rice and 1kg of beans goes a long way too. I regret not buying a rice cooker when I had the money. 

As for greens I've never seen anything better than Wal-Mart memorial, they've always got that display case being replenished with salad kits and other less than ideal plants. You need the greens for the micros. Brussel sprouts are cheap as fuck and if you cut them in half, tossed them in olive oil and italian seasoning they taste good as fuck roasted in the oven. 

Superstore has an app it's partnered with called Flashfood I think. I used it once and managed to score a kings ransom in food for a couple bucks. The caveat being it's about to go bad so eat up or be left with bad times.

If you're truly, truly broke and thinking about which bill to let slide for the month so you can afford food then stop doing that. I did that for a year, having nothing but sleep for dinner. It fucked my health horribly. Swallow pride and then swallow food. The burden on the healthcare system costs more to fix people who suffer malnutrition. So if you think ""Fuck I'm a leech..."" cause you ate some food then think again, not eating that food is going to tax society more. So eat that food.

If you're at that level then call 211, register with the RFDA. The regional food distribution association. Thunder Bay for all it's faults has one of the most amazing food security safety nets. It's something we should all be extremely proud of.

You register with the RFDA and then you can access all the food banks in your area, which will be fairly numerous, again owing to how amazing the safety net is. Most Food Banks you visit once per week, twice per month or once per month. You can visit them all but within their specific limitations. That alone will completely annihilate a grocery bill for the most part. The amounts given are based on household count.

To give you an idea of what a biweekly box from Gathering Table usually contains.

Canned vegetables of all different kinds, canned pasta sauce, multiple packages of pasta, lentils, flour, sugar or sweetener, powdered or fresh milk, hot or cold cereal, meat which sometimes is big packs of chicken legs or big bricks of frozen pastrami, bread, all sorts of treats like chocolate bars and granola bars, coffee or tea, and it just goes on. Then they'll have a bunch of free for all stuff. If you like natural peanut butter scoop that up because the brand the RFDA gets is amazeballs.

There's also places that do food boxes that are paid, but at a greatly reduced rate. These are usually full of locally grown produce.

So that's food banks, then there is the insane amount of daily free meals. I always rave about the Dew Drop because honestly I think those people are legendary. You can get a bagged lunch between 9:30-3:30 or a hot meal from 12:00-3:30. I like the bagged lunch because it's basically a days worth of food.

In the bagged lunch they give you two sammiches, one deli meats and cheese, the other is egg salad, fried egg, tuna, ham salad or something else. Then 2-4 slices of pizza donated by Little Caesers, desserts that are usually homemade but lots of extra if a bakery does a big donation, granola bars, fresh fruit, bottle of water, a soup, then depending on what else they got they throw it in, 1L-4L jugs of milk, stuff like that. Then they've got all sorts of random breads on the bread rack, croissants, cheese buns all that.

If you go for the hot lunch they just kind of throw stuff at you. I went the other day for spaghetti and they were like ""Hey, box of cajun chicken strips and a take and bake pizza, take this with you and also do you want 12 jars of peanut butter?""

Then nearly every local restaurant downtown has some kind of food program like In Common, where if you're hungry and counting buttons they'll make you a sandwich. Good people there too.

Call 211, check 211's website, get a pamphlet about food in Thunder Bay and prepare to have your mouth stuffed and your mind blown.

And on the pride front. Don't. The RFDA and all these ancillary places and everything that stems from it helps curb food waste drastically, helps employment greatly, and if you look into the For Good Foundation brand canned goods given out you'll see feeding the hungry is beneficial to all. From farmer, to processor, to food bank, to mouth.

Elliot Penner came up with the whole idea. Farmers with bumper crops, surpluses and such get to sell their product, discounted of course. Then processor deals are made, discounted of course, and then distribution is done, discounted of course, so the goods can be sold to food banks for 1/2-3/4 less than what they would usually spend. The more I've read about it over the past year the more I love it. It's not a method that would work for grocery shelves because who knows what's gonna be a bumper crop? So it's gotta be on the feet flexible. So food doesn't go to waste in a field, the farmer gets pay, the processors can hire on more employees, give more hours, etc etc. Then what the food banks spend to buy it gets rolled back into it and I'm having a socialismgasm right now. It's beautiful.",t2_db229vj6,stronzoinbiceletta,0,1648695696.0,0,t1_i2svlvc,i2svlvc,True,ihopesodidyaknow,t3_tskag0,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tskag0/what_is_the_cheapest_grocery_store_in_thunder_bay/,what is the cheapest grocery store in thunder bay?,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tskag0/what_is_the_cheapest_grocery_store_in_thunder_bay/i2svlvc/,58,r/ThunderBay,2,58

"To the lot? Agreed. But finding a place with good off street parking was hard enough that I wasn't going to be picky. 

We looked at a ton of spaces before we moved - parking was a major issue (we were offered a space in the Eaton's building that was being renovated, but the only parking was the parkade - not practical for a business that is a destination space).

"The bad news: That’s not how it works; I wish it were! You’re not going to find “one place” that’s got the lowest prices on everything.

The good news: Renco Foods is *pretty good* for basics. …Those little pork tenderloins are often well-priced, as are their (famous?) giant bags of chicken tenders. I hit the Court St. Renco all the time, but I definitely don’t do ALL of my shopping there.

It all depends on the particulars you’re shopping for. You get used to “which place has the best standard price on what” with experience— if you’re the type of person who’s both willing and interested to keep on such stuff.

John K. Samson - Post Doc Blues lyrics

So your presentation went terrible

All wrong dongles, sweat stains and stares

Leave the TV on with the sound down low in your underwear

Don't despair you'll get it right tomorrow night
In Thunder Bay, maybe

Don't delay, your day is short
You can't afford to wait

I believe in you and your PowerPoints

I know why you can't stay away

Out on Highway 1 with the rental car and a lot to say

Don't despair you'll get it right tomorrow night
In Nipigon, maybe

Don't delay, our day is short

You can't afford to wait

So take that laminate out of your wallet and read it

And recommit yourself to the healing of the world

And to the welfare of all creatures upon it

Pursue of practice

That will strengthen your heart

There's a [new crew program](http://www.tbyc.on.ca/new-crew-program) class running at the end of May.  The class will give you confidence and four afternoons of on-the-water experience, but plenty of people start out cold and do great anyway.  Most skippers are pretty good at giving instruction and whatever responsibility you're ready for.  At the simplest level, just sitting on the high side of the boat as living ballast can really help with the speed of the boat.  

There's also a Thunder Bay Yacht Club Crew Bench Facebook group.  But otherwise, there's a bench at the marina with a sign on it; if you sit there at 5 looking hopeful, someone will probably pick you up.

If you can get a place near boulevard that area is pretty low crime because there's not many services around.

"I think the idea sounds as every bit as attractive as you probably do, but I don't think they work at reducing any inequality issues that they likely originally intended to.

They often make things worse, namely because forcing any, and all, markets to pay this base rate is often above what the market can handle  So rather than some miracle happening, a lot of types of work are simply going to disappear because they can't possibly be worth what minimum wage pays.  That's how you get things like forced automation, but more typically these minimum wage base-rate employees being forced to do significantly more duties during the course of their daily work routine.  Which is not only shitty, it makes a lot of people completely
unemployable; and forces them to crime, or welfare, and nobody should be forced to choose between the two.

To add to this, most of the time the only employers who can afford to pay these rates are the contemptable mega-corportations who have economies of scale.  However, these aren't typically the types of companies who do business in, or near, disadvantaged neighbourhoods, resulting in poorer neighbourhoods having few expensive options for convenient commerce, further driving inequality.

I think the biggest issue within the whole concept of a minimum wage is that if an employer can offer a job at whatever wage they want, the market is ultimately going to decide whether someone is going to voluntarily apply for that work in the first place.",t2_bv1j,hafetysazard,0,1648282755.0,0,t1_i265zgs,i265zgs,False,WereRobert,t3_tmz640,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tmz640/parklane_townhomes_property_management_paying/,Parklane Townhomes property management paying minimum wage for do-everything,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tmz640/parklane_townhomes_property_management_paying/i265zgs/,3,r/ThunderBay,0,3

"Yeah, that's one use!  When each atom explodes, it produces its own particular mix of radiation.  Since the radioactive isotopes are chemically *almost* the same as the regular non-explodey isotopes, you can make molecules out of them and they'll get drawn into certain types of tissue.  You can treat cancer with it, or do special kinds of imaging- if you're interested in a certain kind of cell, the radiation can light it up and make it a lot more visible than it would be otherwise.  Since the isotopes are made here instead of being shipped in from elsewhere, there's a lot of useful isotopes that can do great things that would just expire in the mail on the way here.",t2_a2d0t,tjernobyl,0,1648254518.0,0,t1_i24wmmu,i24wmmu,False,Who_am_I_yesterday,t3_tnv3vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tnv3vv/locally_produced_isotopes_now_in_use_in_cancer/,Locally produced isotopes now in use in cancer diagnosis,/r/ThunderBay/comments/tnv3vv/locally_produced_isotopes_now_in_use_in_cancer/i24wmmu/,2,r/ThunderBay,0,2

"So, every atom is a tiny lump of protons and neutrons.  The number of protons determines what it is.  If there's one proton, it's hydrogen, if there's 6 it's carbon, etc.  Now, there's a number of neutrons in there as well.  If there's 6 protons and 12 neutrons in an atom, it's plain ol' carbon.  If there's 13, it's plain ol' carbon.  If it's 14, it's gonna eventually explode.  Like, if you leave a pound of carbon-14 on your shelf and wandered off for 5,000 years, you'd find that half the atoms have exploded and turned into other atoms.  Carbon-12, carbon-13, and carbon-14 are all isotopes of carbon.  Some isotopes explode quicker than others.

"Business people will always say they can’t pay more, increasing the minimum wage will bankrupt them. They have this on AutoPlay and parrot it at every opportunity. It doesn’t matter what the facts are.  
Many businesses that hire people with limited education, limited skills and limited future prospects are perfectly fine with paying people the lowest amount possible and with treating their employees like dirt. They are fine with this because they are confident that if these people quit there will be other losers to take their place. You can call this the Greater Fool Theory of Employment. A lot of the time they are not wrong.  
The Pandemic yielded a huge insight: There are millions of Canadians who have limited education, limited skills and limited futures who are absolutely ESSENTIAL to the functioning of the Canadian economy. While some of us were lucky to work from home or even quit our jobs, these people took on huge risks working in grocery stores, health settings, slaughterhouses, nursing homes, driving trucks, and many other places so that society could function.   
What do they get for their efforts? Nothing.  
Canada is already deep into a massive demographic crisis that will last for decades. There are already shortages of workers in all types of occupations and that will only get worse. Immigration can only partly address this problem.  
Employers will have to increase their employees’ wages, or they will go out of business.  
Driving around Thunder Bay, I have to wonder how many coffee shops, convenience stores, restaurants, grocery stores, and many other types of businesses do we really need, and how many are really economically viable. I think the real answer is a lot less than we think.  
Do we really want a society in which a significant chunk of our populations are condemned to living in poverty or barely able to survive? I know I don’t.

"Depending on the level of play you're looking for, there are a few leagues in town that I'm aware of. Some are ""slo-pitch"" which I think just refers to it being an underhand pitch but it can get rather fast. There is also lob-ball where the pitch has to land on a mat behind the batter - this one seems a little more for people just going out to have some beers and have a good time.

I was part of the Thunder Bay Mixed Slo-pitch league a few years ago and it wasn't a great experience. Some people take it very seriously. On top of that, you have to Ump games either before or after your own which was never fun. Especially when some of the hardos disagree with your calls. It's fun when you're playing a team that is also just out there to have fun, but that's maybe only half the time. The season also kind of dragged on. I think we played twice a week, from mid May to early October with like 3 or 4 tournaments on weekends.

"I applied to work for them a couple of years ago.  The phone interview went something like this:  After a long explanation of my skills and experience, including pictures of my work, and the guy said ""Do you have any questions?""  I told him that the ad said that pay was $16 per hour but could be negotiated on the basis of experience and skill, and that we hadn't discussed that.  He said ""Well you seem to have some experience (I have more than 20), so we'll give you an extra $1"".  Honestly, I couldn't stop laughing on the phone.  I then realized he was serious.  Supply my own gear, on call, and be able to rebuild a destroyed unit in time for a new tenant for $17 per hour.  I explained what I thought was fair and he just said ""I don't think we're going to be able to close that gap.""  The only gap was the one between his ears.

"I agree with your point. I think how you worded it is dumb. Let me get the exact quote from you that I’ve been having an issue with. And that I already commented about.


“The issue is that the logic of “masks should be required in schools because covid spreads easily in school settings” although correct, leads only to masks being required forever… “

Which is why I said “the argument isn’t keep masks in school forever” it’s “keep them in schools for like another week or two” 

Maybe I didn’t make that clear enough originally. 

But you worded it like it’s mask off now or never. Which isn’t the case, and that’s the point I was making.

Then my point about public transit... just to clear it up now. Is why are people getting pissy about masks in schools maybe being kept for a bit longer. But not city busses and cabs n shit.

"And we still see cases of the bubonic plague. Do we still have plague doctors running around? 

Sure it’s an extreme example. But things end, is it too early for covid, probably. But if your worried about it, then keep your mask on. I do at work because I’m seeing 200+ people in a day. And my sister wears one at school, because there will be hundreds of kids without. There will also be an uptick next Christmas, this Easter, and probably every single other holiday this year. Should we just shut the world down every holiday?

It’s a shitty situation. But it’s at the point where we can start leaving it behind. Key word being can.

"It depends on how much you're going to do yourself. I know we renovated a small house recently here, and poured a concrete floor but got a family member to do the concrete and to pour a floor in a 7x10 slab was about 1000$ worth of concrete. All in all repairing the space cost 6000$ just for material. The only thing we did was repair one wall, put in new insulation and replace the floor with concrete and rig it for I floor heating. 

I feel like from that, just the materials could easily cost 20-30 000 dollars to build a house, and most contractors make 30-60$/hour.

If you have land that requires permits you should probably also factor that in, because you will need it to build.

If you want to build a whole house, I would put aside at least 50 000$ and that might be on the lower end. Because it's not considering electricians to wire the house, and plumbers to put in your toilets, and bathtubs.

Finishing a bathroom can be pretty expensive too. It's probably a good idea to put in the electrical and plumbing when you build the house if you intend to have it one day. You would have to redo all the drywall to put the electrical in later and it can be logicaticallt complicated to put in plumbing after you build especially if you're gonna have a concrete slab.

To be on the safe side, if you want a house built and you're not doing the labor yourself, it would be wise to set aside at least 100 000$. It's not nice to run out of money half way through building so getting real quotes from some contractors would be a good idea.",t2_4e6lsxw9,shiddytclown,0,1648020121.0,0,t1_i1rnczt,i1rnczt,False,aguwritsuko,t3_tkcii6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThunderBay/comments/tkcii6/cost_to_build_a_1storey_rural_farmhouse_prepost/,Cost to build a 1-storey rural farmhouse?

"-You can either make your life here or waste it while getting a side of crippling student debt on the side. 
-From day one email your prof, look up a paper they wrote and sound interested about it. You will get on their good student list. There is no harm in being a teachers pet. Ask questions but not stupid ones. Don’t be philosophical too.
-Your program Chair is your Goto for course registration related issues. But he is not your guidance councillor. There is a difference. I do not know what your back ground is but if you are out of high school, this is different system all together. When you ask for help in here, they expect you too already have a solution and all they want to do is give their okay on the matter. This goes for everything. 
-Treat your assignments as your final exam. If your assignments are worth more than 10 % they will make a huge difference in your mark. If you do good on midterm and assignments. You will pass the course no issues even if you bomb the final as you would be eligible for special exam. It’s an exam you do twice in your university lifetime to get a 50 to pass a course. Basically redoing your final exam. 
-Be approachable and also approach people when you need help. You will be surprised how many people would want to talk to you after you start the conversation. 
-If you want to have fun, good luck. We have like two night clubs and all the bars in town are frozen in a time capsule. 
-it’s better if you drive, bus service is okay but the convenience in -30 weather is priceless. Also do install a block heater. With out that you will be asking for trouble. The kind that will cost thousands.
-There will be good days and bad days. There will be days when you would think this the best thing ever, there will also be days when you think this is the worst decision in your life. If you want to make it till the end, make sure you put in enough work to stay in between. That is a healthy balance between studying and fun.

Healthcare, schools and prisons should never be about making a profit.
