"Uhhh… I think I have read this carefully enough to understand your direction, though it was admittedly difficult.  

People confuse freedom of speech. Freedom of speech does not mean freedom from judgement, consequences, or opinion due to your speech. It simply means you can’t be litigated against for things you say, barring they don’t impede someone else’s rights. That is the key, you, as an American citizen, are free to do whatever the fuck you want, as long as those actions don’t impede on the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness of another. That is why laws exist, and why you can’t go 120 on the highway (you are threatening those things for others.) This, however, does not mean that private sector entities can’t take action against you if they don’t agree with your stance.

"I have lived in the York Chester Historical District for around 5 and a half years, and I haven't had many problems with the area.  In general, this section of town (West Gastonia) isn't great, but I've never experienced any major issues here.  Honestly, the biggest complaint I have is that my street is 321, which is a major highway, and so there's a constant stream of traffic coming down the road.  It very rarely gets backed up too far, and it's only reached my house once, but it's just extremely loud.  If you don't like the sound of cars driving down the road at way past the speed limit, don't move here.  But overall, the community is nice enough, it's got some pretty nice houses and yards to see, and it's only like 5 minutes away from all the places you would normally go to, like grocery stores, gas stations, restaurants, and other things like that.  I wouldn't say that this would be my first choice to live in the satellite cities west of Charlotte, but I definitely wouldn't tell someone not to move here.",t2_2xybuf2j,TriPulsar,0,1624383288.0,0,t1_h2o9rmb,h2o9rmb,True,jj9534,t3_o53rpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastonia/comments/o53rpq/york_chester_historic_district/,York Chester Historic District,/r/Gastonia/comments/o53rpq/york_chester_historic_district/h2o9rmb/,2,r/Gastonia,0,2

"Realtors in Gaston County tend to not pay much attention to renters as the rent commission is ridiculously low. Usually $100 or so.

Cramerton, Belmont, and McAdenville and the immediately-nearby surrounding parts of Gaston County are definitely your best bet for safety and family stuff, but you’ll be fine pretty much anywhere.

I know this is a very late reply but the Trump rally messed up our plans that week.

I had no idea that people could be blocked from leaving. What if there was an emergency or something that she had to get too? Is that a normal thing to happen during Rally's?

"Unfortunately theres a lot of people trying to take advantage of the chaos and riot and steal shit and commit other crimes which like you said lessens the effect of peaceful protests and also gives those bad cops what they want!

There also seems to be anarchist instigators in large cities who are trying to rile up the crowds and create more chaos. Theres a video on r/publicfreakout (iirc) right now that shows a man breaking up a curb in front of a cop line and the peaceful protesters grab him up and bring him to the police line to take into custody. For context he was breaking up the curb with a hammer to have projectiles to throw at police or throw through plate glass windows of shops but more likely to throw at police and incite a response to make more headlines of police crackdowns. The sad part is they really dont need to make shit happen as theres enough unprovoked shit happening already. That one video of people on their porch recording a line of police in riot gear walking down the street at night before curfew and firing rubber bullets at them on their porch is a fucked up video in itself showing that theres police taking things too far!

"There are a few community colleges. Gaston college being the closest is affordable and offers a lot, granted it isn't top tier but it's good for what it is. CPCC is in Charlotte and is a bit bigger, the plus here is a great theatre arts program. CPCC invests a lot into the arts. Just to add, locally there are some good community arts such as Little Theatre of Gastonia, Gaston Dance Theatre, and a handful of others off the top of my head. Production value is is excellent for a less than $20 ticket. Now in Charlotte you have a range of arts from Actor's Theatre which is community theatre to Broadway tours, art exhibits, museums, shows, dance, festivals, etc. Just Google arts in Charlotte. I live in Gastonia but work in Charlotte and we enjoy the arts a lot in both places. If you don't want to pay for parking in uptown Charlotte just drive to a Lynx station and park and take the transit into the city, it's nice and cheap. If the Charlotte 2040 plan goes through there will be a transit train that travels west from Uptown Charlotte following Hwy 74 to Gaston county. I know the current Gastonia City Council is trying to make it work out with the state to have the train extended into downtown Gastonia which would make commuting to Charlotte airport/uptown way easier. Look up the Charlotte 2040 plan for more so you'll know what to expect in the future because regardless of what people say Charlotte is such a regional powerhouse that what they do has an impact on the region. In my opinion the best thing Gastonia can do is make themselves into a more affordable Charlotte to attract people that like the diversity, arts, and experience in Charlotte but don't like the higher cost of living.

Yes and no.  While its true that we only have one brewery (Cavendish) there are tons of places that have great beer from both the NC region and beyond.  The wife and I definitely prefer [Brixx](https://brixxpizza.com/menu/beer/) out of all of them. They have around 30 on tap at a time and a weekly trivia night that lines up with $2.50 draft night.  It also helps that [Cavendish](https://www.cavendishbrewing.com/) is one of the newer breed of craft brewers that doesn't think being a craft beer maker means you sell 5 different kinds of IPA. They're a bit smaller but have a good range of what they actually make.

"Yeah see, that's on all the locals. I moved out here cause, well I love rednecks. They are real people, don't play games, you pretty much know in 30 seconds how they feel about ya. They can have a good time with a case of beer and a tire swing...just real folks. Though, I could have done without the Klan rally they had in Bessemer the year I moved here. That was a bit much, all them folks in white robes and pointy hats riding past Franklin Square...ick. 

Now, most of Charlotte has refused to come out here because they are convinced we are all angry, evil 'Deliverance' type people. It was awesome. When I wanted to go to Charlotte, easy trip down I-85 or Wilkerson and I was there. South Point launch, not crowded. I could go to the store without Muffy and Buffy getting in the way. Now, folks realize we ain't all  crazy and they can survive out here. 

&#x200B;

Now they are cutting all the trees down, home values are going berserk, and all the old time places are getting replaced with Yuppie stores. I85 is busy as hell and Franklin is too.

"Did you take the dog to be scanned for a microchip?  Is he/she wearing any sort of tag that might be able to be traced for ID?  Did you report the dog to county animal control as found so that they can run it against lost animal reports?  

There are several lost dog facebook groups that you can post to, as well - the ""Lost and Found Pets - Lincoln County NC area"" one is very active.  There is also a general NC one.  It's usually recommended to not disclose the gender of the dog and remove or obscure the collar from the photo so that anyone claiming that the dog is theirs has to know the gender of the dog (but they have a 50/50 shot at this) and ID the collar as proof that they know the dog.  Keep the area vague as you've done here.  Lots of people will try to claim a cute little dog like this, so ask for proof of ownership like photos of them with the dog or vet records with a description of the dog.  Areas and date/time lost needs to match up, as well.  

My dog got out a few months ago and I had her back within 4 hours thanks to that facebook group (don't crucify me, yes, she was wearing tags *and* is microchipped, the finder just kept calling the wrong number).  Apparently several other people had tried to claim her before I came for her and she's not even a cute little fuzzy dog - she's an awesome dog, but ""just"" a brown shepherd mix.

"Your gastonia neighborhoods to live around would be off of

South union rd from Robinwood elementary to forest view high school. 
Also the area of chapel Grove is very nice and not far from I-85 and 25 min to clt.
Stay away from airline (where I live)
Myrtle school rd. South 321 past clemmers gas and laundry. Or 321 north past the courthouse
If you like older houses the 321 historic district offers beautiful renovated mill houses.
I'm 24 lived here 24 years. There ain't a rock I have left unturned in gaston county.

"Gastonia isn't that bad. Belmont has a nicer small town feel, and a shorter commute. Shelby's commute would be hell. 

Edit: I have lived in Gastonia or Belmont my entire life. I also do IT, and am 31 (and formerly was a mechanic). So take that as you will. 

Edit 2: Homes/property in Belmont is more expensive than Gastonia, on average. I don't know much about property value in Shelby, but I can bet it is lower than Belmont, it is also a different county. If you have kids or plan on having kids, Belmont schools have historically been good, but have been a little less so lately. Gastonia is a mix of good and bad schools. A lot of the schools that were really good, are less so (Belmont included) in recent years, and I think it is NC's attempt to adopt Common Core.

"If you're a drinker, look into something like the breweries or Muddy River Distillery. The distillery does tours on the weekends and is actually on Groupon. I think their current deal on their own website is the same as the Groupon deal anyhow. 
As to the breweries, there are plenty of great Charlotte area brewers to choose from. Most of them are dog friendly too which is a huge plus for us. If you're specifically looking to stay in Gaston County, River Men is the only option I know of. They are about to expand and another brewery (York Chester Brewing Company) is moving into their space.
