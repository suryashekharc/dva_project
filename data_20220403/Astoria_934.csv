"Not sure where you found that statistic. I usually start with city-data.com, since they populate their crime statistics from public record. They have a lot of other data that's either crowdsourced or pulled from private sources, but their crime data comes from public record.  

If you check their [Astoria](http://www.city-data.com/city/Astoria-Oregon.html) and [Vancouver](http://www.city-data.com/city/Vancouver-Washington.html) pages, it looks like in 2019 (the last year for which they have data), Astoria had 9 and Vancouver had 206 rapes.  

Given that Vancouver has about 19x the population of Astoria, it seems like Vancouver's numbers are just slightly higher. Even if you look at the average across all types of crime, the rate per capita looks about the same.

Don't think there are many breed restrictions in Astoria or Clatsop County; the problem is finding decent affordable places that accept animals in general. In my experience it's a very anti-pet area that already has an extreme lack of housing.

"TBH I don't know exactly, we assumed it was either to advertise what a unit would look like furnished, (we kept it pretty neat/tidy,) or for insurance/damages reasons, although the second one makes less sense because wouldn't they just do that before/after move-ins?  Another option could have been maybe they wanted photos of the (relatively new-ish) unit for their own reference on upgrades.  I didn't ask, because I wasn't really worried about anything.  Can't remember if it was written in the pre-inspection notice, or if the guy just sort of asked if I minded if he take a few photos of the apt. when he arrived.

"Funny you ask, I tell everyone who will listen not to ever get involved with Sowin's if they have ANY other options. As in, I was ready to live in my car rather than continue renting from them.

They have properties that are I would literally describe as squalor. They rented me an apartment that turned out to be heavily infested with fleas, which I promptly let them know about, but they dragged their feet and didn't do any kind of treatment to the apartment for several months until out of frustration I threatened them with legal action over my right for my landlord to provide a vermin-free space and I sent my 30 days move-out notice. Flea infestations have to get REALLY bad before you start actually seeing fleas, and they had even replaced the carpet before I moved in so I can't even imagine the state of the place before then. I'm talking waking up with my legs COVERED in flea bites and I was having panic attacks from how flea-bitten I was. I have a phobia of biting insects now from that experience. 

Other fun things about that property was the fire escapes in the hallways were painted shut and they didn't have a cleaning company to clean the building and there was literal dog feces in the hallways. When I included these details in my move-out notice, the lady I was talking to told me it was ""ludicrous"" to make a legal complaint or to leave a poor review. I have actual photo evidence of these things. Oh and they kept my entire security deposit despite me only living there for 3 months and spending very little time in the apartment (you know, because of the flea issue).

"If you love the outdoors, you will be fine. If you are used to city life, it will get incredibly boring. We have very limited services around town and most things are closed by 8:00. I moved from a medium sized city, and it still blows my mind how slow paced it is here. 

Rentals are way over priced and, as others have said, near impossible to get. Don’t move here until you have a place to live. Tons of people are living in RV parks because they cannot find a place to rent. 

If you need someone to work on your house, you might be waiting months. Many businesses can barely find employees. Our fast food places sometimes have to limit hours or close for the day because of this.

With all that said, the people are remarkably kind, and it is the most gorgeous place I have ever lived. It will never get old having elk in my yard and listening to the ocean at night from my backyard (I live in Warrenton). We have incredible bodies of water around us.

"Sweet Relief.

I can't recommend Mr. Nice Guy for several reasons. I keep hearing from people they overcharge them at the register. Though just rumors the stories I have heard are pretty consistent about  when they get caught and they always claim it was just a mistake,  and I kept hearing they make that mistake a lot lol. I also think they undercut how much they sale because when I used to go there, they had it all pre packed in jars. They don't weight it in front of you. I buy the same amount every time, and I know my tolerance level and after feeling like I was going through my stash too fast, I switched to sweet relief. I immediately noticed how much I was saving for the same amount and strains, they weigh it every time, and it lasted me way longer like it did before so I knew at that point they were not putting the right amount in their pre packed jars at nice guy and still selling them for the full price. From my experience, Nice Guy will scam you. It's a shame because they do have a nice looking shop on the inside and out, and it's conveniently placed too, but their business is shady and it sucks.

Astoria sits on a penninsula and most of it is already built up. There's only 1 main route through town and everyone going through there from Seattle or Portland or wherever makes it very congested.

The only question remaining about vaccination and prior COVID illness is whether *both* doses are needed in the previously sick.  It appears there is a diminished return from the second dose in this population.

The CDC agrees with this study as well.

"Nurse here.  They are ALL hiring.  Folks simply aren't staying.  There are many, many reasons for nurses quitting bedside care for non-front facing work, that began long before Covid slammed into an already broken system (that most resisted talking about publicly).  I'd go into details, but I'm not sure the 12 page wall of text belongs here. 

&#x200B;

Back to staff issues.  I'm traveling.  I just finished a job an a mid-sized Oregon hospital.  Nice facility.  Had all the tech and tools you'd need.  Good, cooperative staff.  And Oregon has much safer ratios and nurse care (at the state-mandated level) than most states.  I thought it was great, granted, I'm never there long enough to see the internal politics, I just do the work and leave.  I love the work, which is why travel is ideal...no internal facility politics to contend with.

&#x200B;

During 3 months (night shift), I watched 5 night nurses quit med/surg (your basic, standard level care hospital bed unit).  In addition, one transferred to another unit.  In addition, I heard whispers that one was fired.  So.  In the breadth of 3 months, 7 nurses are no longer working the night shift.   

&#x200B;

That is a massive hole in serviced beds, and in the capacity for progressive care and ICU to transfer more stable patients down to regular care.  In addition, this backs up ED, causing them to turn their ED beds into hospital bed to ""board"" patients instead of seeing regular ED customers, creating 10hr ED wait times, because there are no appropriate beds available to admit their patients to.  Enter covid.  I believe this is what anyone would call a clusterfuck.

&#x200B;

Travelers.  Well, I can sign a contract, but if I cannot find a short term, furnished rental (with basics of living, like an actual kitchen to prepare daily meals for 3 months straight) within the price range of normal rent, then I have to cancel the contract I sign before arrival, with apologies.  AirBNB is for wealthy people, these days (not sure why this happened in the last 2-3 years, but it has).  Most regular apartments won't rent short term, to a travel nurse, even with an 800+ credit score, a contract proving income for those 3 months, and good references.  And the average airbnb monthly rate is over $3k.  I've seen airbnbs as high as $14k/mo.  Travelers duplicate expenses, which means paying BOTH rent and mortgage for your actual house at the same time.  No one's turning the electricity off for those 3 months either.  So the assumption that we can afford $3k/mo is absurd.  Some travelers absolutely will not travel without their dog, so they'll pick/choose locations with accommodations that allow for pets.

&#x200B;

My point is, staffing is not so simple.  It's a spider's web of dominoes.  Those dominoes include your area's available rental housing.",t2_p8hut,whitepawn23,0,1630019098.0,0,t1_hahj7gd,hahj7gd,False,Dranwyn,t3_pc1j89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/pc1j89/people_without_covid_are_dying_because_of/,People without COVID are dying because of unvaccinated people are taking up the beds.,/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/pc1j89/people_without_covid_are_dying_because_of/hahj7gd/,16,r/Astoria_Oregon,0,16

"Yes, I know quite a bit about it. BTW, I had CenturyLink in Knappa for 3 years, while working from home, and it was both slow and unreliable. It would go down frequently, and there was even a period of 2 weeks in which we had no connection at all (but still had to pay for it). Newer built-houses with newer cabling work better, but the older neighborhoods have terrible infrastructure with no improvement in sight.  


Althea is a community network system, using line of sight antennas (it is not satellite, that's different). So basically it is a system for sharing internet among neighbors/community, with all the financial and security aspects of that handled by the platform in the background. It is managed by Clatskanie Co-op, which is a legal co-op, meaning that all users of the system are members of the co-op, and all profits are redistributed among the community. So it is the only internet service to my knowledge where costs consistently decrease over time, instead of increase. Most people pay between $40 and $60 per month, and heavy data users generally pay around $70 - $100 per month. I consider myself a pretty heavy user and I've been averaging about $60 per month. I've got retired neighbors who use much less data and are paying under $20 per month.  


At my house I get between 35 and 60 Mbps symmetrical (so both upload and download speed) depending on time of day, latency is generally around 20 ms or less. The fastest speed I ever got with CenturyLink was about 12 Mbps down and 0.8 Mbps up, with latency around 30 - 40 ms, in the middle of the night. In the evening, CenturyLink was unusable, streaming video was impossible, even basic web browsing was frustrating. So it is a huge difference, with Althea streaming video never buffers, gaming is smooth, etc. There has been some downtime recently, but overall I would say the connection is much more reliable than CenturyLink (case in point, since switching to Althea I've used my 4G hotspot so much less that I never have to pay for data overages there anymore, so that's extra money saved).",t2_2n2asdq8,minimal-camera,0,1629829382.0,0,t1_ha6x5ni,ha6x5ni,False,adam_shaleen,t3_m7fd73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/m7fd73/internet_providers/,Internet providers?,/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/m7fd73/internet_providers/ha6x5ni/,2,r/Astoria_Oregon,0,2

"It isn't the tourists- they mostly drive drunk.

Most of the crime here is DUII and simple theft (car prowls, some burglary, and a bunch of shoplifting). 

As such, there is a shockingly high number of child abuse cases, a number of sexual assaults, and a lot of domestic violence.  These stack up in the winter when the tourists aren't here.  The vast majority of this violent crime is not random, and tends to target certain social groups. The worst offenders typically know their victims, and know them well.  

All that said, it is a pretty safe place to live and walk around, even after dark.  There aren't any really ""bad"" areas, but bad people do bad things to the folks in their circles all over the place.

So, yes, there is a lot of crime here.   No, I don't lose sleep over it.

"If you're looking for a retailer that carries ""dress clothes"", then the answer is yes; Fred Meyer's or Portland.  

How badly do you need clothes and how much are you willing to spend? If you're willing to spend about double what you'd spend at a Men's Wearhouse, you can get custom-tailored clothes without leaving home.  

[Tom James Clothing](https://www.tomjames.com/) will come to you for an initial consultation and measurement, then come back for the fitting when your clothes are done. It takes about 6 weeks (depends on how many items you order) and it will fit perfectly. You can pick the cloth, the cut, and the details (collar, buttons, cuffs, etc.), or you can just go with their recommendations.

"Since nobody has responded, I just wanted to say this sort of thing can be a hard task to accomplish in Astoria. At least it was for me. I tried to hire young adults from the high school for a similar project last year and got zero takers for what was easy money. Admittedly, the pandemic was much more rage-y at the time and the vax wasn't available yet. But the ""2 Men & A Truck"" business model for labor and moving help is very slim here. As a general rule of thumb, expect long delays for services in Astoria. It's not unusual to have long waiting periods for services unless it's a real emergency. Contractors and legit service providers are regularly booked many many months in advance!

Hi there! Same situation for me and my partner. I recently got a job at the community college in town and we moved from Nebraska. The town is super nice and welcoming. The housing situation was really hard for us as well. It took a solid 2 months to find a place and we had to get emotional support letters for our animals. We worked with Sowins Realty and they were super helpful in finding a rental in town. I’m not as familiar with the area since we moved to town about a month ago but commuting into town seems rough even from places like Seaside that aren’t that far away. I would definitely recommend trying to live in Astoria if at all possible.

"Hey there!

My fiancée and I BOTH recently accepted teaching positions at Astoria High and will be moving there in August. I would highly recommend taking the offer! Everyone in the building has been so welcoming to us so far. And from what we can tell Astoria is a great school to work for, is growing, and is strongly supported by a thriving, growing, and progressive community. The admin and everyone in our respective departments have been soooo welcoming and helpful so far.

We are also moving so had to search for housing. While we tried the traditional route of looking for housing using sites like Zillow and searching for property management companies we had a really hard time. If you do accept I have the name of a woman who owns several units that was going to save one for us until we ended up finding something for ourselves, she also referred us to other landlords. We eventually found housing by looking on AirBnb and contacting rentals that offered long-term stays and seeing if they would be comfortable with something more permanent and we got INSANELY lucky and found a 3 bdrm across the bay in Warrenton/Hammond. I know we had some other leads as well before we went with this one. \*\*They key to finding housing in Astoria seems to be a dash of luck and a ton of resilience, persistence, and ingenuity.\*\*

Go ahead and PM me back if you're interested or want more information or to talk more. We can exchange contact info. I would be happy to give you all the help I can from one teacher new to the district to another!

"Oh- wrong answer.

She bought a rundown old house on the hill that a movie happened to be filmed in.  She fixed it up, paid taxes, and made it her home.  For a long time, provided people walked up the driveway (it is expensive to pave) she let them use her property for pictures.  For years she even invited  people in.  There weren't many visitors for a lot of those years, as it was just an 80's movie.

Then a whole bunch of entitled pricks decided that because it was in a movie they watched a a kid, her home was somehow now public property.

Her yard was trashed, people stole the donation box.  Folks would walk up to her house and look in the windows.  People would open the door, walk in, and steal from her.  She found used condoms and human waste in her yard.

At the same time, her neighbors had to deal with douchebags blocking driveways, parking in their yards, and generally being assholes.

Get the fuck over yourselves.  It is (and has been for a long time) her home.  You saw a movie, and nobody owes you shit for it.  It isn't even all movies- just the damn Goonies.  Nobody goes messing with the houses from Ring 2 or Kindergarten Cop.

"...but wait, there's more!

**Beer**   

* [Bridge & Tunnel Bottleshop](https://www.facebook.com/beers4all/) - If you’re in town for the beer, where should you start? Start here. Dwayne, the owner, will guide you. He always has great regional selections on tap, as well as a great selection of cans and bottles from all around. Ask him what you shouldn't miss while you’re in town. He’ll steer you right!
* [Fort George](http://www.fortgeorgebrewery.com/) – Best beer in town, IMHO. Three different bars with multiple taps in each. The upstairs has a wood-fired pizza oven and the best view. There's also a downstairs solarium and the Taproom across the courtyard. Food and beer choices are different at each bar, so if you don’t find what you like when you walk in, try wandering around!
* [Reach Break](https://twitter.com/reachbreakbrew?lang=en) - Second best beer in town with a big outside courtyard as well. These folks don't have food, but there are three food carts out front and there's a cider place next door.
* [Reveille Ciderworks](https://www.astoriacider.com) - OK, it’s not beer, but it’s really close to the other great beer spots and it’s the best (only) cider in town. Lots of options here!
* [Buoy Beer](https://www.buoybeer.com/) – These folks make beer in classic German/Czech style. Excellent view! They sit right on the water and have a wall of windows looking out on the river. There’s even a glass panel in the floor where you’re likely to see a sea lion basking below. The food is ok, but most folks come for the beer and the view anyway.  

**Wine**  

* [Brut Wine Bar](https://www.brutwineastoria.com/) - For such a tiny spot, this place manages to cram in a great selection of really good wine. Obviously tradeoffs must be made in order to fit such a small space, but the owner does a wonderful job of not only keeping the selections fresh, but offering something for all tastes. There's a nifty outside ""parklet"" where you can sit and enjoy your wine. You can also pick up food from any one of the carts or restaurants and bring it here to enjoy along with your wine. 

**Cocktails**  

* [Voodoo Room](https://columbianvoodoo.com/voodoo/) - One of the best bar scenes in town. They also have a pizza oven. The bar is great, but pizza is hit or miss because it all depends on who's cooking. On the plus side, the pizza oven works well and they always use fresh ingredients. You just have to hope you get there when the right person is working the oven.  
* [Blaylock’s Whiskey Bar](https://www.facebook.com/Blaylockswhiskeybar/) - This place has a *proper* whiskey selection, but they also do great craft cocktails and have a very nice menu of small plates; cheese and charcuterie of course, but also smoked salmon, roasted veggies, and other tasty bites.  
* [Labor Temple Diner & Bar](https://labortempleastoria.com/) - Wild and weird, the Labor Temple is an eclectic mix of old and new Astoria. In the mornings, they serve a proper diner-style breakfast that’ll stick to your ribs. In the pre-COVID days, they hosted fun events like Family Feud (competing bar staff from local bars), karaoke, bingo, and open mic night.   
* [Inferno Lounge](https://www.facebook.com/Inferno-Lounge-1565865660367480/) - Right on the water, the view simply cannot be beat! The drinks are good and the crowd is fun. I’m not a huge fan of their house infusions, but the bartenders make a mean cocktail.

**Places to stay**  

There’s really no shortage of places to stay in town, so instead of making this a comprehensive list, I’ll just give you the places that are representative of the Astoria experience. You can find the Holiday Inn Express, Hampton Inn, or other big-name chain hotels via Google. The spots that follow are something different, each in its own way...  

* [Cannery Pier Hotel and Spa](https://www.cannerypierhotel.com/) - OK, let's get this out of the way first: Cannery Pier is an experience. An *expensive* experience. It sits out over the water and all of the rooms have epic views with spa tubs.  
* [Hotel Elliott](https://hotelelliott.com/) - Another one in the middle of town. The Elliott was renovated not long ago and they did a lovely job. The rooms are nicely appointed and packed with modern features like heated floors, in-room fireplaces, and great beds.
* [Commodore Hotel](http://www.commodoreastoria.com/) - A cute spot in the heart of downtown. It’s actually the same building as Street 14 Coffee, where you can pick up a coffee to start your day.  
* [Crest Motel](https://astoriacrestmotel.com/) - A classic American roadside motel with epic views. Don’t expect much from the rooms, but the view more than makes up for it. On the outskirts of town, so it’s the only hotel in the list that’s not within easy walking distance of downtown.  
* [Norblad Hotel](https://www.norbladhotel.com/) - If you’d like to save a few pennies, but still stay in the heart of town, the Norblad is your spot. It’s closer to a hostel than a hotel, so expect to see cyclists, backpackers, and other folks on a budget. It’s a fun spot, but be sure to check your expectations first because you might have to share a bathroom.  


**Final thoughts...**  
This is *not* a comprehensive list and it's only my opinion. Find your own Astoria adventure, but hopefully you can use some of this as a starting point.",t2_9wriq,w00gle,0,1623949438.0,0,t1_h23yolq,h23yolq,False,Cjr126,t3_o1o2iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/o1o2iu/hello_astoria_redditors/,Hello Astoria redditors!,/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/o1o2iu/hello_astoria_redditors/h23yolq/,8,r/Astoria_Oregon,0,8
"OK, deep breath... Here we go!

**Scenic**  
The view from the [Astoria Column](https://astoriacolumn.org/) is spectacular. That’s probably the best way to either begin or end your visit to town. Start from anywhere and go uphill. At some point, you’ll see painted “column” icons on the street with arrows pointing the way. You can’t miss them. Once you get there, even if you decide not to climb to the top of the column itself, the view is still spectacular. You owe it to yourself to take a look around.

If you’re just looking for the best view, start at the Column, but be sure to take a trip down the Astoria Riverwalk. The trip down the Riverwalk will take you past Buoy Beer, Inferno Lounge, Frite & Scoop, the Columbia River Maritime Museum and the Hanthorn Cannery Museum. A stroll from the West mooring basin at the West end of town to Pier 39 at the East end usually takes about an hour and a half.

If walking isn’t your thing, rent a bike - by the hour or for the day! [Bikes and Beyond](http://www.bikesandbeyond.com/), the local bike shop, can help you with friendly, skilled service - whether you’re renting one of their bikes or you need help with yours.

**Cultural**  

* Museums  
If you like museums, we have some world-class options: the [Columbia River Maritime Museum](http://www.crmm.org/) is truly exceptional. There’s also the [Oregon Film Museum](http://www.oregonfilmmuseum.org/), [Flavel House](http://www.cumtux.org/default.asp?pageid=35&deptid=1), [Clatsop Heritage Museum](http://www.cumtux.org/default.asp?pageid=8&deptid=1), [Hanthorn Cannery Museum](http://www.canneryworker.org/), and [Uppertown Firefighter’s Museum](http://www.cumtux.org/default.asp?pageid=9&deptid=1).  
The [Garden of Surging Waves](http://www.astoriachineseheritage.org/) isn’t a museum as such, but it is a memorial to the Chinese people who made up such an amazing part of Astoria’s history. Astoria’s international cultural ties run deep. If you take the time, you can learn the history of Astorian [Sikhs](https://oregonencyclopedia.org/articles/east_indians_of_oregon_and_the_ghadar_party/), [Finns](https://oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/historical-records/finnish-socialist-club-picnic-astoria-1922/), [Swedes](https://astoriascanfest.com/history/), [Norwegians](http://www.astoriascanpark.org/heritage.html), and of course, the [native American people](http://nativeamericannetroots.net/diary/1540) who were here long before Astoria was conceived of.

The links above are only starting points. If you’re interested in the various people who came together in this place that we call Astoria, be sure to visit the Clatsop Heritage Museum or do a little Googling of your own. There are tons of surprises scattered all over town - memorials to cultures, individuals, and events.

* Art galleries  
Just thinking about building a list of galleries makes me sweat a little, because there are so many great art galleries in Astoria that I just don’t have time to write them all up. Sorry. For now I’ll just add this link to a solid set of [Google search results](https://www.google.com/search?sxsrf=ACYBGNQ8UljGI7dfpUOie0TQp1E49sEn_g%3A1572039283173&ei=c2qzXcWUCtTQ9APX4LjYBw&q=astoria+oregon+art+galleries&oq=astoria+oregon+art+galleries&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0.14096.15018..15286...0.2..0.94.577.7......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j35i304i39j0i7i30j0i8i13i30j0i13i30j0i13.JXSHtGWB4KA&ved=0ahUKEwiFmq_YrrjlAhVUKH0KHVcwDnsQ4dUDCAs&uact=5). If you happen to be in town on the second Saturday of any given month, we have [Art Walk](http://www.astoriadowntown.com/2nd_Saturday_Art_Walk.aspx), where all of the galleries in town host special shows and are open to everyone. It includes a map!

Finally, no discussion of culture in Astoria would be complete without a mention of the [Liberty Theater](https://libertyastoria.org/), a Renaissance-style theater built in the 1920’s, following the Great Fire of 1922. The Liberty was the symbol of Astoria’s rebirth after the fire, but it fell into disrepair in later years, to be reborn yet again as the result of a major restoration effort in the mid-2000’s. 


**Shopping**  
So many nifty options. 

* [SHIFT+Wheeler](https://shiftwheeler.com/): A combined store with nifty creative options for clothes and bags. [SHIFT](https://www.instagram.com/shiftastoria/) makes body-positive clothes and gear. If you find something that’s almost what you want, Becky will customize it for you. Nick at [Wheeler Bag Co.](https://www.instagram.com/wheelerbagco/?hl=en) has a similar esthetic for tough, reliable bags and aprons. These bags and aprons will hold up to the toughest environments!  
* [Munktiki](https://www.munktiki.com/). It was inevitable that a couple of guys making hand-crafted Tiki mugs would end up in Astoria. Seriously.  
* [Astoria Makers](https://www.astoriamakers.com/) makes all SORTS of things. This is a hub for so many creative people to come together, so there’s no telling what they’ll make next. In the same building, you’ll find [Audrey Long Ceramics](https://www.audreylongceramics.com/) and the [Astoria Visual Arts](https://www.astoriavisualarts.org/) gallery.  
* [Gulley’s Butcher Shop](https://www.facebook.com/pg/gulleysbutchershop). Our local butcher will cut you a steak to order or sell you farm-fresh eggs. Don’t forget the smoked pepperoni sticks.  
* [Pat’s Pantry](https://patspantryastoria.com/). Spices galore, teas, mixers and more. They're always adding to the portfolio, expanding what you’d think is possible in a spice shop.  
* [Godfather’s Books](https://booksgodfathers.wixsite.com/godfathers-books) and [Lucy’s Books](http://www.lucys-books.com/) are both uniquely Astorian book stores. How many towns these days can say they have ***two*** locally-owned bookstores that are still thriving.  
* [Gimre’s Shoes](http://www.gimresshoesastoria.com/) is over 125 years old and has been run by the same family that entire time. It’s an incredible slice of history as well as a great little shoe store!

**Things to eat & drink**  
It’s worth noting that almost everything here is in the downtown core, which runs from 9th Street to 16th Street and from Duane Street to the river; that’s 7 blocks long by three blocks wide. You really can’t go wrong. 

**Food**   

* [Busu](https://www.instagram.com/busu_astoria/?hl=en) - It's walk-up Japanese food. The menu changes often, and the place is tiny, but the food is always made fresh to order and exceptional. Just be sure you have a place to go sit down out of the rain where you can eat it.  
* [South Bay Wild Fish House](http://www.southbaywild.com/) - So happy to have a fishing family who serve fresh fish. Also, smoked and pickled fish. Order the fry bread. Don't even wonder if you should or not. Just have the fry bread. You'll thank me.  
* [The Bowpicker](https://bowpicker.com/) - An iconic local fish and chips spot. They make only two things; fish, and chips, from an old boat. In summertime, the line for fish and chips will extend a city block or more. The fish is albacore tuna, and it’s cooked perfectly. It’s very different from classic English fish and chips (cod or haddock), but it’s sooo good.  
* [Drina Daisy](http://www.drinadaisy.com/) – Astoria has a Bosnian restaurant. And it’s so good! Lamb is their specialty, but you’ll have to show up early because they run out. We’ve never had a meal that was less than excellent, but the service is definitely “on coast time,” which means they’ll get to you when they get to you…  
* [Frite & Scoop](https://www.friteandscoop.com/) - French fries (Belgian, actually) and ice cream are a surprisingly good combo. They’re both good, but if I had to pick just one, it’d be the ice cream. Bonus points for the fact that it’s all made on site! You’ll find new flavors all the time.  
* [Himani Indian Cuisine](http://www.himaniic.com/home.html) - Vegetarians and carnivores alike will find something to love here. These folks are so friendly and helpful. If you’re familiar with the cuisine, you’ll find something you like. If you’re not familiar, they’ll help you along. Daily specials are always standouts!  
* [Sasquatch Sandwich](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sasquatch+Sandwich+Shop/@46.1884018,-123.8340877,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54937ba3da8ddf03:0x730cd83e8769b75f!8m2!3d46.1883981!4d-123.831899) - No website, but Sasquatch is yet another food truck with seriously good sandwiches! The first time I tried them, I thought they were a little pricey for a sandwich, but totally worth it!  
* [Surf2Soul](https://www.instagram.com/surf2souloregon/) - Another local food truck without a web presence, but you can find ‘em on the socials. Great southern influenced belly-warmers like shrimp and grits or chicken and waffles (sooo good!). Truly the nicest truck in the area.  

*Bonus food*:  

* Best burgers in town: [The Portway](https://www.facebook.com/Astorias-Portway-48385185777/)  
* Best Thai: [Nisa’s](https://www.facebook.com/nisasthaifood/) (in Warrenton, just across the bridge)  

**Coffee**  

* [Coffee Girl](http://www.thecoffeegirl.com/) – The best view in town. It's at the end of the 39th Street Pier, so the ambiance is quite special. They also have very good pastries and small bites if you just want a snack or light breakfast.

Astoria is also one of the only places I've seen with a more difficult housing situation than Corvallis. There are surrounding areas that are cheaper with more places to choose from in the Corvallis area though.

"Can't speak to the schools or kids' activities, but there are multiple farmers' markets - the Astoria Downtown Sunday Market is just one of them. Many local farmers offer CSA's as well. The art scene is amazing for the size of town we live in. It seems as though everyone has a contribution and there are plenty of outlets for showing/selling art as well as for creating art with others.  

Overall, we love it here. We got here at a good time, though... 10 years ago. Right now, housing is ridiculous whether you want to buy or rent. It seems like it's pretty bad everywhere but Astoria doesn't have any land for new development.

"If you are a single mom, with no family in the area. I don’t know that I would suggest it. We live in a childcare desert. The waiting list to get childcare is over a year. Housing is very difficult to find, you basically need to buy into the area, if you can. Houses range from 375k-600k. Work is very limited. There are trades, hospital, and hospitality. 

The good. It’s a very inclusive and welcoming community. People are very proud of the towns Scandinavian heritage, so if you’re from Nordic decent you will love it. There are big hills, but the town is super walkable, we have lots of parks, and activities for little ones. We also have lots of bars, shops, and art like another poster said. Grocery options are limited to Fred Meyers, Costco, Safeway, and the Co-op (best IMO). If you love the outdoors, you couldn’t ask for a better place to live. There are ample opportunities for hiking, bird watching, fishing, etc. Nature is at our back door, literally. 

As for therapy, I see a CPTSD specialist via telehealth as there is not a local specialist. My son has development delays and we sometimes have to drive 2-4 hours to see someone. 

Hope this helps! I went through your post history and I see you are going through a lot of mental healing and looking for a fresh start. I wish you and your little one the best on your journey.

"Wow.  A bunch of comments that make it hard to think they live here.

I do.

Here is what you do:

Stay at a hotel.  Get up early, and go for a walk.  Have breakfast somewhere that smells good.  Maybe even your hotel.   After breakfast, just walk.

Go uphill, or go to the riverwalk.  Look at the sunrise.  If it rains, let it hit your face.

But keep walking.  Explore the shops.  Watch the ships.  We have things for you to discover.  Old homes, hidden landmarks, places where you can see the Pacific trying hard to take Oregon back.

Before you know it, it will be lunch time.  Look around.  Pick two places to get food from.  Share.

Walk a little more, then go to your room.  Take a nap and read something.  Relax.

Get up when you are hungry again.  Go explore.  Find food.  Eat outside and watch the river.

If you take the time to BE in Astoria, it will be romantic.  

This is a wonderful place, but it is still just a place.  A backdrop to the story YOU make.  All it does it make what you do a little better.

You do, however, have to give the backdrop something to enhance.

Walk, explore, talk to people, try new things.  That will make it romantic.",t2_b3ruuokc,JustSomeGuyInOregon,0,1623390719.0,0,t1_h1dflha,h1dflha,True,[deleted],t3_nx3524,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/nx3524/romantic_things_to_do_in_or_around_astoria_or/,"Romantic Things to do in or around Astoria, Or",/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/nx3524/romantic_things_to_do_in_or_around_astoria_or/h1dflha/,18,r/Astoria_Oregon,0,18
"It's supposed to rain pretty hard this weekend, I would suggest a car ride from Astoria east along highway 30, then taking the ferry across the Columbia and exploring Cathlamet. It's a cute little town with a pioneer church. Then you can drive back to Astoria along the Washington side and come across the Megler. There's shops, parks, and things to see along the way. 

Cape Disappointment has lots of places to hold hands and see beautiful vistas. Cannon Beach is worth a visit. You can drive on the beach in between Seaside and Astoria.

"Walking the riverwalk is nice if that's your kind of thing. It's about a 5 mile walk. If you start at the West end, you'll walk past a Maritime Memorial underneath the Megler Bridge, followed by some buildings that will - eventually - be a new Fort George brewery location, then Buoy Beer, then a bunch of shops at 10th and 11th streets. By the time you get to 14th street, you might be a little hungry, so stop at Frite & Scoop for an ice cream cone. Then continue to the Maritime Museum, then on past the Mill Pond neighborhood and end up at Pier 39. If you want to keep going, the Alderbrook neighborhood is cute too.

If walking's not your thing, I believe the most romantic dinner spot in town is Drina Daisy, a Bosnian restaurant on Commercial St.  But even if you don't want to walk the whole riverwalk, there are benches all along where you can just sit and watch the river.

"I grew up in astoria. Its great for smaller kids. Tapiola and Peterpan park are both nice playgrounds. There are some nice places to go for walks and bike rides, including the Riverwalk, Fort clatsop, and Fort stevens. The aquatic center is awesome, the town has a decent library,  easy access to the beaches over in Warrenton/Hammond and Gearhart. 
For older kids its good if they are involved in sports. The schools have well run teams and I believe there are some well run city teams. 
There is definitely room for older kids to start getting in trouble. Loads of underage drinking, and recreational drug use. But there is also lots of room to raise a kid who is too busy or too smart to get involved with that stuff. If I had the opportunity to move my family back to town I would take it in a heartbeat.

"I tried to look this up for you last night. I lived a little south of that Denny's at that time and don't remember hearing about this. That being said, if it did happen you have a few options:

1. Contact the Daily Astorian. They will have someone who is good at navigating their archives. Just be friendly. People with obscure jobs love a challenge and will probably be more than happy to help.

2. Go to the Clatsop Community College library. If I remember correctly they have a newspaper archive. It may have been transferred to a digital format and they will be able to help. 

3. Contact the Astoria Police department and ask to speak to a high ranking officer who would have been employed in 2014. They may be able to provide you with a first hand account of the event. You might want to try the Warrenton PD because I believe Denny's is actually in their jurisdiction.

"In short, you may want to postpone your trip.  

We've had a steady increase in cases now that the tourists have decided to come back.  As a result, we're moving back up the risk chart.  Naturally, they all ""intend to abide by COVID regulations,"" but locals keep getting sick.

This is concerning for some folks because our local hospital ships the serious COVID cases off to Portland if they get too ill.  This costs a fortune.

Additionally, the higher risk category means that restaurants, shops, and museums will all be limiting head count.

Finally, some locals are getting grumpy.  Tired of opening and closing.  Fed up with following the rules, getting things under control (and kind of back to normal) only to have a bunch of tourists come in and screw it up.

Yes, we are a tourist town, but we are also a lumber town, a mill town, and a retail hub for the surrounding area.

A couple notes

1. The Astoria Column mural got refreshed a couple years back and it looks great!
2. Clatsop is pronounced a bit different than it's spelled.

"I am a network engineer that lives in Astoria near Ft. George Brewery.  


I have the ""Gig-Internet"" Internet-only package from Spectrum (Charter). Max [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) tests I see are about 650Mbps, 35Mbps up. It is the uplink speed that I'm quite annoyed at but otherwise I have been happy with the reliability and speed for a small town.  


The tech installed new coax from the distribution node to the house. It used to land in the upstairs bedroom but I asked if he could run it to the basement wall and he gave me 30ft additional coax to land it where I wanted.  


I see 29-35ms rount-trip-times to the major service and content providers and the traffic in this region is routed through Seattle. No issues with Netflix or video conferencing. Again, it's bulk upload that isn't great (backups).  


\---  


I use GoogleFi LTE as a backup and am able to get 2-6Mbps to an LTE tower on the other side of the Astoria bridge in Washington. GoogleFi is a mix of T-Mobile and Sprint, which are now the same company. Other providers may have faster towers in Astoria-proper.  


I was on the Starlink Beta and was approved in February for Astoria but eventually declined. That would be $500 one-time for equipment and $100/mo for 40-60Mbps. I wasn't able to test reality.  


\---

"So I'm not OP or even live in Astoria, but I've been visiting for my entire life (extended family on the coast) and it's one of my top places to visit for quick trips from Portland.

It has a small town feel for sure, even as a visitor it seems like people know each other. Hell I recognize people from my favorite places. The ""downtown"" area of town is pretty compact, but you'd need a car for sure as the more residential areas spread up and over the hill, across the river into Warrenton, etc.

It does rain a lot during the winter, but there is plenty of good weather throughout the year, even in winter. Get some good rain gear.

As far as things to do:

* Hiking and urban walks. Lots of opportunity for nature hikes around Astoria or within an hour drive up/down the coast. Astoria itself is also beautiful, and a great town to walk around it if you get a block of the main drag of Marine drive. Lots of great hills, cool old houses, and little hidden corners to find.
* Food scene was good before COVID. I haven't been down since Jan 2020 so I don't exactly know what the fallout is like, but there was pretty much everything from cheap bar food to ""nicer"" meals is available. I don't know if Astoria is really ""foodie"" if your coming from a big city, but its way, way better than some of the small coastal towns that I've been to, and I've never wanted for good food while there. All the breweries are great.
* The Long Beach peninsula is just over the Astoria bridge and worth exploring as well. Some small towns and good hiking in the state parks, like Cape Disappointment (which also has a USCG facility).
* There used to be a somewhat active art and gallery scene. Not sure how COVID has impacted that.",t2_9msmi,warm_sweater,0,1617042386.0,0,t1_gspqhaa,gspqhaa,False,domdomdom7768,t3_ma2w4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/ma2w4v/considering_moving_to_astoria_for_husbands_job/,Considering Moving to Astoria for Husbands Job - USGC,/r/Astoria_Oregon/comments/ma2w4v/considering_moving_to_astoria_for_husbands_job/gspqhaa/,2,r/Astoria_Oregon,0,2
