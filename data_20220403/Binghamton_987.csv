"I was in there last year and there were some areas that were dangerous, which I avoided. Other than that, it's alright in most areas.

"It's the lack of hustle. If you grew up in Binghamton or near the area you would never know what hustling means. Out in the southern tier there is no hustle. It almost seems like local businesses in Binghamton want to setup for failure and not think of ways to make customers happier and make outsiders feel welcomed to bring more business. If you live in different cities or different states you will realize what I mean by local businesses here in Binghamton. Mom pop businesses are becoming outdated but mostly in Binghamton. Even the well established local businesses here are struggling and they have the excuse of oh it's the economy, or it's the pandemic, but the real problem is the owner. It's the lack of their hustle along with everyone's hustle in the city. I know states and cities that got hit harder than Binghamton and personally know small business owners from there and they are already back to normal and here it looks like everything is going backwards. Just think of why Chik FIL A or Firehouse subs despite numerous years and attempts to open in Binghamton or even the Vestal area have not opened along with other well known chains. Not to mention not a single Krispy Kreme in the state, yet we have to cross 1 hour to PA and there is literally EVERYTHING thriving. Hmm. Makes you wonder if it's the local businesses here in Binghamton that are the ones to blame for not attracting Chik FIL A.

"If they were heavily drugged, as the charges imply, then they cannot give consent. If they went to the hospital not long (or a certain time) after, then they can see what drugs and the amount that was in their system. Additionally you have the phones of the accused, text messages to each other, + any texts to anyone else, plus any witnesses + statements to those that were told anything. The prosecution may also have character witnesses from the accused's past coming forward to be on the stand to discuss their behavior/actions.

Additionally since they're seeking DNA from only Leor then the DA likely has DNA from the others to link them having intercourse (rather rape) with the girls. 

Based upon the accused being hit with those much harsher charges suddenly on arraignment, it tells me that the DA's office feels that thry have a strong case, and/or were previously awaiting significant results of some kind, or possibly more witnesses coming forward.

Long pants, tuck them in or cinch at the ankles. Stay on trail, avoid crashing thru tall grass and brush- that's where they get on you.

My main addition - if you take a shower when you get  home, you minimize your risk significantly.  It does take some time for them to get to work, so shampoo before they have a chance.

The Broome County IDA on Tuesday approved a lease-leaseback agreement with a Rochester-area development team to facilitate financing for the demolition of the Country Club and construction of a new 75-unit apartment complex at the site at 4301 Watson Blvd. in the Town of Union.  
  
Conifer Realty, in partnership with LeChase Construction, agreed to purchase the 9-10-acre parcel for $300,000 in January. The action by the IDA will allow the developers to hit a looming deadline to apply for low-income housing tax credits through the New York State Office of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR).

The project will create apartments for mixed-income families earning between 30-90% of area median income, around $52,200. Rents are expected to range between $700 and $1,000.  
  
Stacey Duncan, executive director of the Agency, expects an ‚Äúexpeditious timeline‚Äù to learn if Conifer's HCR application is successful. The determination could be made as soon as mid to late summer, but the final plan might not be finalized until the end of 2023.  
  
‚ÄúThey (HCR) speak very highly of Conifer Realty. They like the location of this project in a high-performing school district,‚Äù said Duncan.

The tax credits would offset some costs associated with the project, which is estimated to total approximately $40 million. The agreement with the Agency, the county's industrial development arm, includes tax exemptions of about $2.7 million.  
  
The Agency‚Äôs cost-benefit analysis of the project found over $33.1 million in public benefit over the life of the 30-year PILOT agreement. A public hearing on the proposed benefits will be held at a future date.  
  
The purchase contract agreement is expected to be finalized by the end of 2023. The agreement includes the potential for an extension into 2024, if necessary.  
  
A clawback provision will also be included in the agreement. The provision will allow The Agency to reacquire the property if the project does not materialize in a ‚Äúreasonable timeframe.‚Äù Board chairman John Bernardo said the provision was ‚Äúabsolutely critical‚Äù for the high-profile project, which has been a focus of the IDA for several years.  
  
The Agency took a $5,000 option of first refusal on the site in 2019, hoping to redevelop the location through a public/private partnership. It issued an RFP in July 2021 and the Conifer-LeChase proposal was the lone response to focus directly on housing, which the county preferred.

**What to know about the new building**  
  
The building will stand three stories and about 35 feet tall. The 75 units include 18 one-bedroom apartments, 38 two-bedrooms and 19 three-bedrooms. Some units will be set aside for residents with mobility, hearing, vision or other impairments.  
  
The wood-framed structure will hold all 75 apartments as well as communal amenities such as a fitness center, a community room with a kitchenette, laundry facilities, an outdoor patio and a playground. Management and maintenance of the facility will create three to four jobs with a yearly payroll of $286,000. Construction is expected to create 130 temporary jobs at over $10.9 million.

Vehicular access will be provided off Watson Boulevard with parking lots at both ends of the building.  
  
Conifer is planning to utilize the southwest corner of the site, near the intersection of Watson Boulevard and Barton Avenue, as a public greenspace available to the public. The plan would keep a pocket of the former country club open to public recreation.  
  
The Agency is currently performing some property maintenance at the site per the town‚Äôs request.

**Say goodbye to the IBM Country Club**

The IBM Country Club‚Äôs days are numbered. The Agency has received a condemnation recommendation from Delta Engineers, and officials will soon meet to discuss a timeline for demolition.  
  
‚ÄúThe question is how quickly we can get the building down,‚Äù said Duncan. ‚ÄúThe property is deteriorating quickly.‚Äù  
  
In July 2021 Broome County allocated $2 million in American Rescue Plan funding to spur site development. Those dollars are now expected to fund demolition efforts, though whether the Agency or the developers oversee the demolition is yet to be decided.

Once a fixture in IBM's heyday, the property has deteriorated while sitting vacant for years, with parts of the site condemned by the Town of Union.  
  
Duncan said an upcoming meeting will help determine if the building can come down ‚Äúsooner rather than later‚Äù to make way for the 75 new apartments.",t2_17796su2,Kliegz,0,1648485705.0,0,t1_i2gfm0q,i2gfm0q,True,Kliegz,t3_tqdeqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tqdeqg/ibm_country_club_to_be_demolished_replaced_with/,"IBM Country Club to be Demolished, Replaced with Apartment Building (75 Units, $700 - $1000/month)",/r/Binghamton/comments/tqdeqg/ibm_country_club_to_be_demolished_replaced_with/i2gfm0q/,14,r/Binghamton,0,14

I should also add that you can NOT buy a yearly membership. It's monthly only. At least for now.,t2_cc6wlatx,AgreeableKey8093,0,1648416751.0,0,t1_i2d1jbh,i2d1jbh,False,AgreeableKey8093,t3_tpqirq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tpqirq/whose_joining_that_gym_in_the_mall/,Whose joining that gym in the mall?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tpqirq/whose_joining_that_gym_in_the_mall/i2d1jbh/,0,r/Binghamton,0,0
"First thing, the membership pays for access to everything, pool, classes, and machines and such.  It includes 1 session with a personal trainer every 6-8 weeks.  Additional sessions cost extra and they have different types of sessions with personal trainers.  There is a one on one session for an hour or half an hour and also small group sessions for an hour or half hour.  I don't have the paperwork handy, but I think their are also 2 hour sessions or maybe 90 minute sessions.   Anyway when you sign up they do a physical assessment and they have a machine similar to a scale with these rods you hold onto that will scan your body to measure your muscle mass, bone mass and fat mass in each individual limb and torso.  Water weight (intracellular and extracellular) is also measured. 

The machine measures other things I can't recall, but basically it will tell them where you have disproportionately (uneven) muscle growth among other things so they can plan a personalized workout plan for you to address any problems and more or less make an optimal work out plan for you.  I'm assuming they'll update your workout plan every time you meet with a trainer.

They also have on site medical help in case anyone has a problem and they have a cleaning crew there all day to keep everything clean covid wise and overall. 

Lockers are day use, so it's bring your own lock and empty your locker before leaving. They have half lockers and full size lockers.

Okay, the price.

The rate may vary depending on if they accept Lourdes PFAP (income based financial aid the hospital offers).  That was still in the works last I heard, but at the moment there is a one time fee of $100 which they take $25 of the day you sign up and the other $75 either the day the gym opens or after the 3 trial days people who signed up get, I don't recall exactly.   Anyway after the one time fee the monthly membership is about $60-$65 a month and every 10 or maybe 6 months of membership there is a $32 upkeep charge that goes towards fixing, cleaning, and upgrading machines as needed.  

So $720-$780 for membership for the year and add on $32 for the maintenance fee for $752-$812 a year.  First year of membership is $852-$912, because of the 1 time $100 fee I mentioned earlier.


For what you get, it's worth it if you're serious about getting in shape/staying healthy.  Also, some insurances may reimburse you for gym memberships every 3 or maybe 6 months (it used to be yearly) provided you show up to the gym a pre set number of times throughout the year. The gym can track your visits and forward it to the insurance companies of people who's insurance have a program like that.

While you're here in the Buffalo area, a few important notes:

* Buffalo drivers are the absolute worst in New York State (yes, including NYC and Long Island). Like, really really really really bad. Worse than Boston. So stay on high alert while you're here and be careful merging off of exits as people will speed up to block you from merging. Really. Every time.

* Visit Duff's for wings and Paula's for donuts. Seriously good!

* Skip the pizza here.

This is a tough time since a lot of sports had been shut down, but hopefully we‚Äôll see more returning this year.

"We wear the same size shirt.  JC Penney's in the Oakdale Male has up to 5XLT.  They don't have many of the 5XLTs or the 4XLTs, but I can usually find a few Polo shirts when I need them they almost always have plenty of 4XLT T-Shirts.  Their Foundry brand shirts do not shrink after the 1st wash, but I can't speak for the other brands they have.  Also their big and tall department is at the section before the registers at the back of the store if you go in to the store from the mall. If coming in from the parking lot, just turn right and make the first left. You will see an alcove of clothes and some plates and dishes on the left and across from that on your right is the big and tall selection.   They have big and tall button upshifts as well. 

 When it comes to pants I do NOT recommend JC Penney's, because they're pricey, but unless you luck out at Walmart JC Penney's is the only place I have found that sells 4XL underwear regularly. 

For pants I recommend Burlington. They are at the opposite end of the mall from JC Penney's,  but if you park on the back end of the mall you can walk into JC Penney's from the parking lot, walk back out with your stuff and walk or drive closer to the malls main entrance near JC Penney's and from their yoy should see the parking lot entrance for Burlington to you left if your face the main doors with the JC Penney's parking lot doors to your right. Using the Burlington parking lot door take your right into their big and tall section.  They have shirts also, quite a few in the larger sizes, but I rarely find professional looking shirts there, but they're a reliable source for pants.

We used to have a Casual MaleXL across from the mall, just off of Reynolds Road (the big hill by the mall), but they went out of business here.

"This happened in December. She was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor, can't remember the specific charge, and don't know the current status of the case. I have no idea if she kept her job. I knew her in a past life. Can confirm that she is bat shit  crazy. 
The victim is her daughter.  She has 3 children. The 8 or 9 yr old daughter she assaulted and twin toddler boys she has with the man filming the video.  The daughter had gone to NYC  with her father and his new partner, she is a person of color. Apparently mom saw photos on the girls phone and became enraged and it led to her vicious attack. The man filming, who in my eyes let it go too far, is her  current partner. He finally pushed her off the child yelled ""Alexa call 911"" and pushed the mother to the floor. She can be heard shouting to her daughter ""look what #### did to me! "". I was told she tried to have charges brought up on him.
She has worked as a caregiver and nurse with children and adults with intellectual and other mental disabilities for over 10 years. My hope is the she no longer be permitted to do so.
As for the daughter's status, I hope that she is living with her father in a safe and functional environment, getting the mental health care she needs. That child will be scarred for life as a result of the incident, and I'm sure that wasn't an isolated incident.  She may have been the victim of mental abuse living in that home.  As for the evil bitch, she can fucking burn in hell for all I care, but ideally she should face the legal and professional consequences for her actions, and get the mental help she needs.",t2_4dckb21r,CorporalAgarnsHat,0,1648253004.0,0,t1_i24thfl,i24thfl,True,Thanks_Shallot,t3_tnjv0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tnjv0a/disturbing_video_shows_a_nurse_assaulting_a_small/,Disturbing video shows a nurse assaulting a small child at Binghamton Psychiatric Center.,/r/Binghamton/comments/tnjv0a/disturbing_video_shows_a_nurse_assaulting_a_small/i24thfl/,10,r/Binghamton,0,10

It just should have never gotten this far, both in terms of the incident itself and the ensuing legal battle. The best he stands to win is the original jury judgment, and as cool as it sounds to be the underdog in court, it's stressful and shitty to have years of your life go by having to think about this kind of crap. I've known people who contemplated suicide over lengthy legal fights, even (maybe especially) when they're 100% in the right. It absolutely bleeds the soul out of people to find out how hard it can be to get justice.

They should have just done the right thing and compensated him from the outset, and then learned a lesson from the costs.

"Antipsychotics have been used as an add-on for clinical depression for a while now. I'm surprised you weren't aware. Abilify was the first to be FDA-approved specifially for unipolar depression. There are several others, some available as a generic, some not. Most do carry the risk of weight gain. Latuda is not officially used for unipolar depression, but it can be prescribed off-label. It is weight-neutral and it worked great for a family member. Another thing to know is that antipsychotics take 2-3 weeks to try out, less time than antidepressants.

The only thing that worked for me was clozapine. It's officially only for schizophrenia, but it is sometimes used off-label as a last resort for serious depression. Speaking personally, it's particularly effective at attacking suicidal ideation. After an 18-month episode and 4 hospitalizations, my suicidal ideations vanished within 2 weeks of starting it and depression went from severe to mild. It is hard to find someone to prescribe it, because it carries some risks that require you to get blood tested every week for the first 6 months of taking it. Also I gradually stopped taking it because it was causing serious fatigue that made me quit my job and I gained a lot of weight on it. But it saved my life and my symptoms haven't been more than mild since.

It's unfortunate this information isn't easily accessible and that more medical professionals aren't aware of the full spectrum of stuff to try, considering how common MDD is and how a third of people with it are treatment-resistant. I was fortunate enough to have out-of-network coverage as most competent psychiatrists downstate do not take insurance.",t2_6pr1gh5,hfoqywaaoy,0,1647943731.0,0,t1_i1n69mx,i1n69mx,False,Bleumoon_Selene,t3_thr0mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/thr0mf/has_anyone_had_any_luck_with_fidelis_covering/,Has anyone had any luck with Fidelis covering antidepressant alternatives?,/r/Binghamton/comments/thr0mf/has_anyone_had_any_luck_with_fidelis_covering/i1n69mx/,2,r/Binghamton,0,2
"Thank you for the info and guidance. You seem very knowledgeable.

I am a bit scared of ECT because a friend of mine got it when she was young and it made her worse in so many ways. But she's in another country so I don't know how much different their administration of the procedure is compared to the US. 

As far as medicines go I have tried the following:

Zoloft, which worked ok but some of the side effects were messing with my every day life)

Wellbutrin, which didn't work too much but I took it separately and alongside Zoloft

Trazadone, which I only took for about a week because it made me sleep all the time. When I wasn't sleeping I just felt groggy and cranky because of it. 

Lexapro, which actually made me feel more depressed. 

Now I'm on Venlafaxine/Effexor. It's barely working. 

But I haven't tried any antipsychotics or anything. I didn't know you could use an antipsychotic if you're not experiencing psychosis.

"Spravato is FDA-approved for depression so it should be covered. For TMS ask [this practice](https://tms-ny.com/) and double check with Fidelis. 

Having personally recently recovered from severe treatment-resistant depression, I'm curious to know what you have tried. Have you tried adding Wellbutrin/bupropion and/or an antipsychotic like Abilify/aripiprazole? It's possible to take an SSRI/SNRI plus Wellbutrin plus an antipsychotic all at the same time. Or even older but more powerful drugs like MAOIs? If you can, seek out a good specialist even if it means travelling once in a while. I can recommend someone in Towanda who takes insurance.

Also consider ECT. I tried it and it's really no big deal. Don't get scared. Obviously try other things first though.

"I‚Äôm not questioning the data. More so the conclusions drawn from it and what types of economic incentives are created by reassessment for corporate real estate investors. Imposing an additional cost on landlords via increased taxes likely feels good in the short term. Especially from a political standpoint. That additional cost would be passed on to others. Changes to the cost structure of student housing ripples through the rental market in general. Higher housing costs for all with the exception possibly of existing homeowners. I‚Äôve seen advocacy for affordable housing dominate this sub via this account and the Mrs Binghamton alt account. Not that I‚Äôm an expert in this but raising the cost to landlords and renters and lowering tax rates for homeowners (thus increasing asking costs for existing homes due to lower monthly tax cost) doesn‚Äôt seem to be consistent messaging. Landlording is a business just like any other. The existing tax structure makes the Binghamton market attractive for those developing and maintaining properties. Decreasing their incentive to do so doesn‚Äôt wise based on the housing conditions I see walking around town.

I agree the tax system needs some sort of overhaul. But would amicus and Stonebridge have bought those properties if their tax bills were 800k higher? Would the purchase price be lower to adjust to those higher taxes?   Would local people be priced out of the market anyway by higher taxes instead of higher prices?

Science fiction It is already happening to some extent in our own society. Instead of removing the conditions that make people depressed modern society gives them antidepressant drugs.

"I left a growing city out in the Desert SW to come here, and I don't see much development happening here at all. Plenty of potential with all the decay, but it seems the area is trapped by its past. IBM and EJ are not coming back. Dick's Sporting Goods gave Bing the middle finger and headed off to SW PA. Maybe we could try and leverage the area's history as a sort of ""birthplace of tech"" (IBM) to get a microchip foundry? But do we have the skilled workforce for it? Does BU have relevant programs for employment in such industries? Do the students want to stay here if there were jobs? 

There's push at the federal level to on-shore that sort of manufacturing as China keeps eyeing Taiwan the way Putin sees Ukraine and the Baltics. 

As for ""project after project"" -- it struck me with the news coverage at the outset of the war, all the cranes seen on the Kyiv skyline. Reminded me of just about any major western Canadian city in the pre-COVID late 2010s (haven't been back since!). Satellite cities around Vancouver, and downtowns of Edmonton, Calgary, even Winnipeg -- new highways, cranes all over the place, high rise residential towers, etc. Even the strip malls looked new and less ugly.  

Minor note regarding aesthetics, but how is it that a ""conservative"" (i.e., cheapskate) state like Texas or Arizona with low taxes can make something like a highway overpass a canvas for public art, while in the ""liberal"" northeast, we're stuck with the plain old ugly green paint, rust, and pigeon droppings at every overpass?",t2_1x05i1fx,Borderlandia1,0,1647753124.0,0,t1_i1dd7c6,i1dd7c6,False,WhydeClaw,t3_tg0z8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/,Do you guys expect Binghamton to experience a growth/decline in the next decade and in what ways?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/i1dd7c6/,2,r/Binghamton,0,2

"As others have pointed out, Lupo's and Spiedie & Rib Pit are the quintessential.  Start with these and try all the meats.  I have had the lamb at Lupo's and that was really good.

Come next summer, go to Spiedie Fest and also try others, including Salameda's State Fair sauce.

After all that, make them yourself.  Get some skewers, a loaf of Italian bread, and a bag of Lupo's chicken spiedies from the supermarket.  Skewer the chicken, grill over charcoal, then pull off the chicken using a slice of Italian bread and eat it as a sandwich.  In my mind, much better because you control not overcooking the chicken.

Good luck and enjoy.  After this, travel around and find other signature dishes in nearby cities, like a garbage plate in Rochester from Nick Tahou's.

"If Binghamton/NYS lowered taxes, Binghamton would become a place people would flock to. Simple as that.

During covid, people fled high cost of living cities in high tax states such as cities in California and New York City and moved to smaller cities in lower tax states. Many businesses did the same. Remote work opened the door for high earners to move to Binghamton just like they did to other places....but they didn't.

The whole notion that people wouldn't move to Binghamton because of the weather gets thrown out after you look at what happened to Spokane, Washington. A once undesirable place to live with even less daylight and harsher winters than Binghamton but saw a massive population surge during covid. The city was not prepared for this surge, so lack of housing caused home prices and rental prices to become unaffordable for the people who originally lived there. [https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/economy/spokane-housing-expensive-cities.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/20/business/economy/spokane-housing-expensive-cities.html) . Spokane is closer to national parks sure...but it also experiences many climate related issues that Binghamton doesn't such as unbearable wildfire smoke in the summer.

So what's the main difference? Taxes. Washington doesn't tax income while sales tax in Spokane is only 1% higher than Binghamton (9% vs 8%). Property tax rates are significantly cheaper and business taxes in Washington are also much cheaper than New York. 

Binghamton gets very few if any of the industry benefits of New York City, but gets taxed the same as places like Long Island and Westchester where people commute into the city every day.

If New York created a different income tax zone and business tax zone for areas of the state whose economies operated independent of New York City (i.e. ""upstate""), people and businesses would move here in a heartbeat. Until that happens, I can't blame people for fleeing if they ever manage to generate wealth while here and for businesses laughing at the idea of moving here.",t2_kvdnrmwq,bingice,0,1647649986.0,0,t1_i183bk5,i183bk5,True,WhydeClaw,t3_tg0z8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/,Do you guys expect Binghamton to experience a growth/decline in the next decade and in what ways?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/i183bk5/,3,r/Binghamton,0,3

Binghamton is not a normal rental market about 1/4 of the population are students from downstate where $1200 a month is monopoly money.

Also binghamton is unique in its small and rules don‚Äôt really applly depending on who you know and have connections with.  Its not right but its kind of how things work.

There's also the question of if Cuomo's plans for the region being the central hub of legalized marijuana for NY and eventually parts of PA come to fruition.  That would be massive.

The big concerns for me though are a rise in gentrification and decline in affordable housing around here.

"I expect Binghamton to grow.

We moved here because of the cost of living coming from Colorado. The West is still desirable, but some towns are running out of water, forest fires and climate change will make some places simply uninhabitable. We knew about the flooding potential here, so we purposely looked for housing that was out of major flood zones. 

I made a map of locations that were cooler and wetter, had a lower cost of living but still had a decent economy so that we could find employment. Another advantage for us was that this area had lower numbers of higher education attainment than where we came from, and that means that my spouse would have a better chance of a decent job since he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. We also liked that this area had a mix of political affiliations, class, and more diversity in general because we didn't want to live in a bubble. 

Our biggest drawback was definitely the taxes. We don't mind paying higher taxes, as Colorado's lower taxes are evident in the services that the state provides, but New York property taxes are about six times what we paid there. It works out to a similar amount just because the property is cheaper, but still, I think that might hold back growth a bit if that is what the state or city wants.",t2_ihck3,amandazzle,0,1647530659.0,0,t1_i111byk,i111byk,False,WhydeClaw,t3_tg0z8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/,Do you guys expect Binghamton to experience a growth/decline in the next decade and in what ways?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tg0z8o/do_you_guys_expect_binghamton_to_experience_a/i111byk/,12,r/Binghamton,0,12

">jobs vanishing and--more importantly--the unions that supported them vanishing,

Ironically, the two largest employers in the area that disappeared?  IBM and EJ's were decidedly not union, and many would argue they didn't need to be.  I'd argue that there was no way unions or anyone else would have saved those jobs.

EJ's made a critical error in business model, and ignored the athletic shoe revolution.  IBM-Endicott was heavily focused on Mainframe systems and IBM of the late 80's early 90's was at a crossroads and missed several market trends.  No unionization would have saved doomed business models.

I'd say the area leadership got drunk with the tax and associated revenues that came from those jobs and failed to plan for a future without them.

"Interesting question. The larger area (the Northeast) has had a population decline in the last two decades, driven by the Rust Belt's collapse (Binghamton is on the very eastern edge of that). So, industrial jobs vanishing and--more importantly--the unions that supported them vanishing, which has impoverished the area somewhat. The other thing is elderly white flight out of the state to places like Florida. But that is just one strand. The other big thing with Binghamton is education and some other industrial stuff (engineering, health care, warehousing). The housing market right now is super hot, which is some indication of future growth: some of that (anecdotally) seems to be people decamping to a low cost of living area from big cities. Some of it is big developers betting on the students. These two things are happening to the extent it has created a housing shortage that is bad for the poor (bad). I dunno. I'm bullish.

"Just FYI, look into dental discount plans. [DentalPlans.com](https://DentalPlans.com) is an aggregator website that you can use to help find individual dental insurance plans and dental discount plans. Though, I'd recommend purchasing the plan on the plan's official website and not on dentalplans.com.

A discount plan starts immediately as soon as you receive it in the mail. It's not insurance (which might not be a problem since dental insurance kind of sucks anyway with tons of exclusions and tiny amounts they're willing to pay out). Discount plans not only start immediately, but they'll give discounts on a lot more things (even cosmetic dentistry for example). The discount plan has already pre-negotiated rates for in-network providers - though your discount % may vary depending on where you go.

I've heard good things about Aetna Vital Savings in particular. From from what I've read, dentists that accept any Aetna dental insurance by contract have to also accept Aetna Vital Savings, so the network is much larger than competitors.

Before you purchase it though, call up various dentists to see if they accept it or see if they offer their own discount plan. I know that Lalor Family Dental has their own in-house discount plan, but I'm not sure how it compares to the Aetna Vital Savings. I think they accept that one too.

Also, for the future, the best dental insurance is good dental hygiene  (brush, floss, limit sugar, don't smoke, etc.) and get consistent professional cleanings (2-3 times a year). Apart from injuries to your mouth (which are often covered by medical insurance), expensive dental work is most often only necessary for people who don't take care of their teeth.",t2_ksgddqnz,bingandham,0,1647464705.0,0,t1_i0xn820,i0xn820,True,carolpie,t3_tf2ohq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tf2ohq/dental_work_suggestions/,Dental work suggestions,/r/Binghamton/comments/tf2ohq/dental_work_suggestions/i0xn820/,0,r/Binghamton,0,0

"I moved here about 6 years ago and I‚Äôve also spent time in Hamilton and the GTA.

Don‚Äôt expect this place to be either of them.

That said between Lockheed, BAE, L3 and all the other smaller firms there‚Äôs a solid corps of young engineers in the area. Binghamton University has a group of young professionals as well who are good people.

Entertainment: honestly depends on what you‚Äôre into. Music scene isn‚Äôt great but there are signs of life to it. Restaurants are pretty solid. 

Clubs: there are many community organizations around. Just a matter of what fits you.

Dating: no comment.

Winter: no worse than what you get in Hamilton.

This area has most of what you will need. Syracuse is an hour, Scranton is an hour, Albany is 2, NYC is 3.5 and Philly is the same. We may be the middle of nowhere but surrounding by lots of things.

"I've been doing business in Toronto for over 12 years, so maybe I can offer you a little perspective about some of the differences, or similarities.

Our area is akin to areas like Brantford ON.  We had a history of Industry that has since moved out, and we are now moving on to other economic segments and industries, such as BAE/Lockheed/Binghamton University.  So we have some bright spots, but still a little grit from that transition to overcome.

Our traffic is much better than Toronto and the QEW/401.  Our airport is not.  Public transit is not like it is in Toronto, no trains, etc.  But we have a decent bus system; I'd still recommend a car.  Housing is magnitudes cheaper here.

There is one Timmy's in Great Bend PA, about a 30 minute drive if you're homesick for a Maple glazzed.

If you will be traveling back and forth, get a Nexus card, as it will make your life easy going across the border.

Our area is fantastic for activities if you know where to look.  Skiing 45 minutes to an hour.  Lake's and waterfalls.  A strangely good amount of bowling.  We still have a roller rink.   
 Hiking galore.  Fishing and hunting if you wish.  Some small museums.  An emerging art scene.  Good food and brew pubs (although lacking at the high end).  My sons friends play in local hockey leagues, all though I don't know much beyond that.  We have a local minor league hockey team.

NY City is 3 hours, and Buffalo is 3 hours.  Syracuse is just over an hour, and Ithaca is also about an hour.

As someone who moved to somewhere else right out of college, my advice is simple.  Life is what you make of it.  If you stay in your apartment now in Toronto, don't expect it to be much different here.  If you look for adventure, you'll find it.",t2_3qyin9e5,AllswellinEndwell,0,1647444121.0,0,t1_i0w7kix,i0w7kix,True,IBSurviver,t3_tf9hup,https://www.reddit.com/r/Binghamton/comments/tf9hup/what_is_the_city_like_for_young_people_moving/,What is the city like for young people moving here alone?,/r/Binghamton/comments/tf9hup/what_is_the_city_like_for_young_people_moving/i0w7kix/,12,r/Binghamton,0,12
