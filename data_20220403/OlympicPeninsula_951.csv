"I've had a place here for 2 years now. Went solar in the first year and this year I hope to start growing my own food. The moisture here is insane. Roof on the place I bought was only 10 years oid but already infiltrated by moss.

Solar breaks even or better from March through October or so, but we provisioned 24 kW to get that to work\*.  People leave you alone up here unless you're making an ass of yourself so don't do that and you'll be fine. Also, the restaurant scene is not great so get ready to cook for yourself (I do) and gather provisions from the fantastic farmer's markets and the occasionally Costco run to fill in the gaps. Not quite full time here yet, but slowly building up to it.  


Finding competent general contractors/plumbers/electricians is hard. Get to know people by word of mouth. My roofer exploited our winter departure to leave a job unfinished (and kept the unfinished bits outside the view of the security cameras we put in). Much jumping up and down upon returning got that fixed in a week, but yeesh. In contrast, our solar installer was excellent as were the people who replaced our dying heat pump and water heater.

"Mostly related to building:

If you plan on building, you might want to hire a wetland biologist for a simple wetlands presence/absence survey before pulling the trigger on land. There are a lot of patches of forest considered woodland wetlands even though you don't see surface water. If you have these, they will need to be delineated and classified, and they all have development setbacks up to 300 ft. 

It's worth checking the county plat viewer to see if there are any other complications such as elevated landslide risk, critical aquifer recharge zone, water rules, or mapped endangered species habitat on the land. These can affect your ability to get development permits.

Also, depending on the county, there's a good chance you won't be allowed to change the zoning on a property.

You're probably looking at 2-3 years from start to finish to build a house around here currently.

">I have never been able to get my head around how inconvenient and costly (time and money) that would be.

In a lot of ways, living in Clallam Co is like living on an island, no doubt. 

SeaTac is basically the same amount of time (2.5hrs) to ferry or drive around. I often ferry one way ($13.20) and then drive the other (Tacoma Narrows $6.25 toll is only on the Eastbound trip). For a lot of Seattle visits we can take the Strait Shot bus for $10 to the Bainbridge Is ferry terminal and then ride across for free (Eastbound walk-ons). The return trip is the $9.25 ferry ticket + $10 bus ticket again. It's really not bad expense-wise.  Scheduling can be a pain, but ride a motorcycle and you'll always get boarded onto the first ferry. 

It's not like we're doing it every day and unlike living 2.5hrs East of SEA (Yakima for instance) we have resonable public trans options and nice (if cool) weather. 

Also, regarding ferries, we have 3 to choose from (Port Townsend-Coupeville, Kingston-Edmunds, Bainbridge Is-Seattle) depending on where we're going, so it's not like we're all stuck driving to the same ferry terminal. I don't count the Fauntleroy-Southworth ferry or Bremerton-Seattle ferry because they're a complete waste of time for us. 

The biggest hindrance is weekend traffic on 101 & 104 in the summer (fortunately we're often going the opposite direction from the worst of it) and the opening of the Hood Canal bridge which compounds the traffic issue on 104.

  1. Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability?
  2. What work or task has the dog been trained to perform?

One of the trainers we spoke with said she'd seen a few ""predator presence"" trainings done in order to get the service dog used to such a presence.

The road along Lake Crescent is frequently closed by slides, fallen trees, extensive summertime repairs, etc. So that cuts off access to the rest of the park from PA. The Makah reservation has been closed to the public throughout COVID, and slides have blocked many of the west end roads since fall.

Deer Park Road is only open a few months a year.

La Push is rez country and there are loose, aggressive dogs all around, especially on the beach.

All of these places are crazy crowded six months of the year. Desolate beaches? Try Alaska.

"I am in general a recluse. I’ve been in AZ for about 3 years and with the exception of a female friend I know no one, and I am 100% okay with that. The isolation is actually a large factor in my decision as well. I’m okay with rain having spent a decade in SF and a year in Portland. I know it rains more that far north but I’m pretty sure I can cope. I’ve found out that desert heat makes me more miserable than any other weather I’ve lived in. Top reason there is that even at night it’s 95° + here and I still have to be conscious about my pup overheating while we play fetch and whatnot. I miss the snow a bunch but don’t want to live where there’s feet of it every winter. Weather and location wise I feel pretty confident I have made the right choice. I am currently taking another certification for rehabilitating dogs, and as soon as I am done I’m moving to Fresno CA to live with with a friend and save the $$ for the move north. I am definitely going to come up there for a week or two and see what it’s actually like. But I feel certain that the location fits almost all my needs. Thank you for the heads up though.

"Test is the wrong word perhaps. But I’m fairly certain there is a “public access test” she would need to pass. And therein is the problem. As much progress as we’ve made, she still gets a little strange if there’s too many people. Never aggressive, but her body language makes it clear that she needs to get out of the situation. That alone would disqualify her. She’s tasking just fine and learns fast. My issues are psych related, and she’s picked up almost intuitively what needs to happen. 

That being said, the pacific North West beaches are really the main draw for me to move out there. I looked at forks for a bit and tried to convince myself that would work out. But I’m guessing that establishing a client base out there would be challenging at best. I was going to move to the Eureka area in CA, but for reasons I’d rather not get into (they’re not legal fwiw) it’s just not an option any more. I lived in Portland for a year and spent a lot of time driving around coastal OR and CA. Trinidad CA was my jam. La Push is really what I want to be near. The beach is the best free therapy I’ve ever had. I’m currently in AZ and loathe it. It’s beautiful but not my thing. I’ve spent the last year researching a place to move. And Port Angeles looks like it offers the best of most of my requirements. But providing my pup with the same quality of life she brings to mine, is in the top three qualifiers for my decision.

"While it’s not the only deciding factor, it is a large part the the equation. There’s no way I could go hiking and leave her home. The only insight I’ve had to how things work there dog wise is the internet, and beyond the NP info, which is pretty much “no dogs unless they’re a service dog” I’ve been unsuccessful in getting a clear picture. Other insights would be things like, are people good about their dogs being on leash where they’re supposed to be? Is there a large homeless or stray dog issue there. I’ve been able to see (at least from the internet) that there’s a homeless problem there (like most of the country at this point) and I know from working with dogs since 1999 that there is often a direct link between homeless people and abandoned pets. There are many factors that play into that, but mostly it’s that subsidized housing often doesn’t allow pets and the state (where I’ve lived at least) doesn’t do much to help re-home the dogs. 

Thanks for the info!

"If by recently you mean in the past few weeks, no.  I don't know what the snow levels are now.  But in the past couple of years I've parked there and hiked many times.

"indoor growing is energy intensive and really not necessary most of the time. how many people are you trying to feed? 1 acre of prime full sun arable land can easily feed an entire family. 2-3 acres is more ideal though. indoor is only needed for starting seeds, or if you want to do a glass enclosed grow room, so you can do high temperature plants. but, what would you be growing inside? most of your bang for your buck crops need to be outside. and then how did you settle on 10 acres? that is a LOT of land for just a few people.

solar will not work on the coast, or south of the olympics. Sequim is your best bet for solar due to the rain shadow effect.

1 million all in--are you planning on building a property? If so, that will not be enough. It is definitely enough to get a property with a house already on it, though the state of that house could be widely variable. there are lots of 5 acre properties out there with a run-down house on it for 800k-1.5m. but building from scratch? not even close, unless you are willing to build a very simple/small home. if you are trying to do anything custom, you will be cutting it extremely close, verging on too risky to even try.

meeting needs is what everyone else is doing too. don't worry, if you manage to pull this off, people here are friendly.

leaving your property in a trust is a great thing to do, however, that may not be an option depending on where you go. you can't just ""make"" your property a ""trust"". its a lot more complicated than that, and highly dependent on county officials. there's a good chance they just say ""nope, you can sell your property, or we can, you choose"". turning it into a county park facility, is something that occasionally happens, but, not often. lots that are developed for single family residence often stay that way, for a reason. public lands often become dumping grounds, white trash campgrounds, etc. its often best for land preservation to have a responsible owner who lives on the property, and counties know that. in the interest of preserving property values they often keep some amount of control over this type of thing.

good luck. it sounds like you guys are pretty early on in this process. its a long road. i recommend coming out and spending some time in a few places on the peninsula, namely, grays harbor, aberdeen, port angeles, sequim, and then the inner kitsap part. get a feel for the area and look at some actual properties in person.

my quick take is that your eyes are bigger than your stomach. i recommend adjusting your expectations a bit. think, 2-3 acres, and be flexible. with the amount of capital you have, you don't have enough to be choosy. would you be willing to live in an old tear-down for a while if it was a great property? these are the type of questions you'll have to be able to answer before moving forward.",t2_t70cr,protovack,0,1643081640.0,0,t1_hu3vzol,hu3vzol,False,AccordingClassroom58,t3_sbxaqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/sbxaqv/my_husband_and_i_are_planning_to_relocate_to_the/,My husband and I are planning to relocate to the Peninsula.

"Completely fair. I left post vague becauseI wanted to get a feel for how to pose more specifics. 

We are hoping for a property that will allow for a decent growing season (3-4 months) as we plan to cultivate a hydroponic indoor system built-in to our primary residence to supplement for leafy greens, herbs, and mushrooms (not necessarily hydroponic but there it is). 

We are researching necessary permits, zoning, and easements to narrow down our search. 

Solar is a consideration as we plan to be as off-grid as possible. 

As far as budget goes - we plan on $1 million all in but there a little bit of wiggle room for the “ideal” property. 

The definition of “honoring” to us is to become a part of the local community while remaining respectful of the land and the existing culture as much as possible, while still meeting our own needs. 

Our ultimate goal is to leave our property in a trust that becomes a conservation once we pass.

"what are you looking for? there are a ton of different versions of a homestead out there. also, very wide range of price. a 10 acre estate in the wynoochee valley on the river can easily run into the multiple millions and that's to start. the prime estates with good fertile soil, in good locations, are highly desirable.

it would help if we knew roughly how much you wanted to spend, what you plan on doing with your property, and roughly where on the peninsula you want to be. the weather can be widely variable, but unless you're on the inner Kitsap side or up north around sequim and port Angeles, it can be brutally dark and rainy with a short growing season. many areas are not good for solar. grays harbor, for example, has some of the lowest solar radiance of anywhere in the continental united states. 

not really sure what you mean by ""honoring"" the communities out here. would you be planning on doing something disrespectful? sorry, just not sure what that means. if you did have neighbors, they'd be doing exactly the same thing as you, more or less. if you mean, are people hostile to out of staters coming in... not really. i mean, it's not like youd be the first. i do think a lot of people have a very rosy impression of what it takes to run a homestead on the peninsula, and there are many people that try it, then pack up and leave in a couple years.",t2_t70cr,protovack,0,1643074336.0,0,t1_hu3fc0z,hu3fc0z,True,AccordingClassroom58,t3_sbxaqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/sbxaqv/my_husband_and_i_are_planning_to_relocate_to_the/,My husband and I are planning to relocate to the Peninsula.

- if you can work remotely do it.

"Looks like I am bit late but wanted to add a couple thoughts on PT that differ from some of the other comments:

Kids: It is true, PT has a lot of the older generation, but with that said, I have two young children with another on the way. My neighbor has a two-year-old, and next to them, they have young twins. Maybe just the luck of the draw but almost every house on my street is a young family. Also, when you have a young family, you find other young families, so our kids have plenty of playmates.

WFH/Internet: Wave is our only good, broadly available service. I am a WFH employee for a big tech company (not HQ in Seattle), and I need quality Internet. I am currently getting 250/10 from Wave on a very consistent basis. They do offer up to 1Gbps/30Mbps. Do keep in mind that not all houses are hooked up, and if the place you find is not already connected, you could be looking at a very large bill to get set up. The PUD is also rolling out their own Fiber to the home, but that is still early days unless you get really lucky on getting a house that is already in one of their service areas. Finally, there is always StarLink, but last I checked PT is looking at Late 2022/Early 2023 for new StarLink hookups.

Community: Anywhere you go, as others have said you are going to need to make an effort, by joining groups in town. However, with COVID, a lot of groups are still virtual, and it is hard to make friends over Zoom. On the flip side, when you do get to meet people in person, they will be super excited to have a ""young"" person.

Housing: Finding a place to live here is no joke. Whether you want to buy or rent, the key is to know people (or get an agent that knows people). The only reason we live where we do is because our network knew people selling a house and we were able to buy it without it going on the market. You will find a bunch of houses sell without ever being listed.

Hospital: Jefferson is a tiny hospital, a pack and ship type place. With that said, I have gotten services there and have received good care. There is still plenty of times I need to travel into Seattle. Regardless of where you decide to go, I would recommend signing up as a member of AirLift NW. It is $60/year for a family, and should you need their services, they will wave any amount your insurance doesn't cover.

"Port Townsend is sort of charming and seems like a decent place to live, but it does not seem like a great place to raise kids to me.

Port Angeles feels much more like a ""real"" city to me, more child care options, more things for kids to do. And you can easily take the ferry to victoria for even more opportunities (lots of museums there). 

Not sure what you mean by ""occult"" but, its western washington, you are going to find all kinds of people. Especially out on the peninsula. when you are moving to a new place, you have to be friendly and be open to making friends/neighbors with all sorts of people. well, you don't have to be, but it would greatly benefit you to consider doing so.

"I grew up in Port Angeles, now live in Port Townsend.

With small kid(s) on the way I'd almost certainly encourage Port Angeles. PT has very few child-care options. I moved to PT when my kids were in 1st and 3rd grade and was shocked at how few options we had for after-school care. Most of the activities in PT are geared for retirees, a constant frustration of mine when community art classes are on a Tuesday at 2pm for instance.

PA has a bigger/better hospital
PA is going to have a more active social scene due to its bigger size (nearly 3x bigger).
PA has better internet options. Residential fiber is available in PA. The best I can do in PT is Wave Cable which gets me about 30mb on a good day. 10-20mb on most days. And that's in the middle of town.

PT is in Jefferson County, the ""oldest"" county in WA state having the greatest percentage of retirees+. Housing is really tight in PT and you'd likely be paying Seattle rates to buy or rent. PA has more private and public-school options with more funding and better busing. A bigger library in PA with regular events for littles (pre-COVID). 

I wouldn't worry about the progressive/liberal aspect in PA, it's actually a pretty healthy mix in my experience. WRT being shy/introverted it won't matter if you're in PA or PT, you've got to make the effort to build community by getting active in the community. I will also add that you'll encounter people who aren't happy to see remote workers who typically make 2-3x local wages swallowing up all the housing aka gentrification. We're not in a ""shun the outsiders"" mood, but as a local I hear plenty of grumbling from my blue collar friends - and in a way they're right. Getting priced out of your community sucks.

Most of the families I know are migrating to South of Port Townsend into Port Hadlock/Chimacum areas. The services of child options are even worse, and you're pretty much ""in the sticks"" at that point but it's an area they can afford. So I'd almost say the Port Hadlock/Irondale/Chimacum areas are ""up and coming"". However the school there is in even worse shape than in Port Townsend due to lack of funds and kids.

https://www.peninsuladailynews.com/news/data-clallam-hit-opioid-peak-highest-in-state/

>PORT ANGELES — Prescription pain pills that fueled the opioid epidemic poured into Clallam County at a greater rate per person than they did in almost any other county in the Pacific Northwest from 2006 through 2012, but prescription rates have decreased significantly in recent years.

The article goes in to describe the difference between the two towns ( PA : Clallam :: PT : Jefferson )

>Clallam vs. Jefferson

>The data shows vastly different prescribing habits between doctors in Clallam County and its neighbor, Jefferson County.

>While Clallam County received 76.6 pills per person per year, Jefferson County received 28.2 pills per person per year, well below the state average of 45 pills per person per year.

>Pharmacies in Sequim distributed 13.8 million pills, more than twice as many than all of Jefferson County, where pharmacies distributed 5.8 million pills.

>In 2012 Jefferson County had a high-dose prescription rate of about 10 prescriptions per 1,000 people. That has now dropped to slightly to 7.9 prescriptions per 1,000 people, or about 1.5 times the state average.

>“When we look at the numbers for Clallam, most of our prescribers were prescribing poorly,” Unthank said. “A large majority of our providers were prescribing in dangerous ways, so we had to do a concerted effort at the county and clinic level to change that, which luckily has worked.”

Best access to the Olympic National Park is going to be in Port Angeles. PA is also the biggest town on the Peninsula and has the best internet access options including fiber in some places. The ONP HQ is in PA, and you're either driving directly south to get into the mountains or 30-minutes east or west to access the Eastern side of ONP or Lake Cresecent. Another hour or so and you're at the coast. PA also hosts the Black Ball ferry for a 2-hour boat ride to Victoria, B.C. Kind of a shitshow these days due to COVID, but in normal times it's a great weekend get-away. Cool factoid at PA - it ""picked"" the last several presidents of the US. IOW, PA is a very moderate town with fairly split liberal/conservative representation (more conservative on the outskirts)

Sequim. I hate Sequim. It's a farming community that slowly turned retirement community, then all the farmers sold their land and the big box stores slurped it all up and emptied what soul the town had. Ha :P Sequim is alright, a little closer to Seattle, very flat in most parts, and access to the Upper Dungeness and more eastern section of the Olympics.

Port Townsend. Where I'm currently at now. Internet is so-so, access to the Olympics is meh compared to PA. But what it lacks in access it makes up in culture. PT has a very strong arts/hippie/sailing vibe. It's not for everyone - if you're die-hard Trump voter, you're not going to feel comfortable in PT. If you love boats and getting on the water, PT is the place to be if you can find a place to live. PT is on a peninsula on a peninsula and there are a variety of pressures squeezing the housing market here.

Access to city life, airport, etc. Kinda like being an Islander, you don't move here if you want those things in your life regularly. You move to the Peninsula b/c you either don't care so much or don't enjoy the aspects of city life. It's an hour and a half drive from Port Angeles to the Bainbridge Ferry which takes you to downtown Seattle. It's an hour from PT.

What I love about living on the Peninsula is the smaller communities means it's easier to build community and make friends. People who talk about the ""Seattle Freeze"" - I don't know what they're talking about. Join some clubs, volunteer, get engaged and you'll find friends and community.

Another option is the Olympic Hot Springs, an easy and free alt to Sol Duc. Warm, natural pools even if the weather turns chilly.

"Consider the pool of available singles to be dwindlingly small, exodus after adulthood is quite common.

Also the ""Seattle Freeze"" is nothing compared to how city outsiders are welcomed, probably not unique to the area. The natives tend to have a different political viewpoint than urbanites so best to play along...until your viewpoint eventually flips one day. 

Depending on where you end up the availability of fancy groceries/restaurants may be nonexistent. This can be very difficult until one day you see taco bell as a rare treat and whole foods as a ridiculous display of excess.

The transition will probably be easier on the eastern side of the 
Olympics. The ferry ride to Seattle is a convenient escape, especially as your city driving skills fade and I-5 begins to feel like a death trap.

Consider buying a firearm and becoming proficient. It is the country after all and cougar attacks are real thing. As for human vermin, aside from the high violent/property crime rates in many ""cities"" tweakers *love* to live in the shadow of the woods. They look and act like desperate insects, many from out of town (on the lamb or recently discharged from one of the correction facilities) and others leftover from that exodus train they missed at adulthood. Just outside the more populated areas it is not uncommon to see torched stolen vehicles - or torched trailers from cooks gone bad for that matter.

"Located in Port Townsend - 

This is Andy. He is 2 years old, about 70lbs, and in desperate need of a loving, quiet home. My partner and I have been trying to rehome him for awhile now with no success. He is not our dog and we are doing this as a favor. The home he is in now is just not a good fit for his temperament. He is quite reactive and needs someone who is patient and has a very big heart. He cannot be with small dogs or cats (no exceptions). He is a nipper and therefore not the best option for someone with kids. 
My partner and I have received nothing but love, kisses, and positive affection from this dog, but his current owners can't seem to figure out how to care for him and have planned to have him put down on Monday. We are devastated. You can bet that if our intact male would allow it, we would have adopted Andy in a heartbeat. He is so sweet to us but does not seem happy in his current home (and we can't quite pinpoint why). 
Please help us find a home for him. He deserves so much better than he is getting now. He has NEVER tried to bite, nip, lunge, growl, or do anything aggressive at my partner and I, which tells us that he is just so unhappy at his home.

"I'm just saying you might be able to do it, including at least the start of sunset, but you'd need to arrive late at the Westport campground. You might have to skip the hike to Hole-in-the-Wall.

You are trying to squeeze a lot into one day. Forks to the Hoh is around a two-hour drive round-trip, and Forks to Rialto an hour round-trip. Rialto in the morning and the Hoh in the afternoon would be more time-efficient, in that there is less of a back-track. Add in meal and bathroom breaks. The earlier you start the better.

And that doesn't include actually doing something once you're there. Figure two to three hours to hike to Hole-in-the-Wall and explore the tide-pools, and an hour and a half to two hours to hike the Hoh trails.

Alternative itineraries that could save time:

1. Visit Rialto in the morning and the Quinault Rain Forest in the afternoon.
2. Visit the Hoh Rainforest in the morning and Ruby Beach in the afternoon.

### This is not a legitimate reddit user!

This is a **scammer** trying to rip you off.  Do not buy from any links in comments or messages!

* *Scammer:* **BenChapman88**
* *This Post:* [Magic Olympic Mana](https://old.reddit.com/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/nubqms/magic_olympic_mana/)

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

---

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE & AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

---
## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

"Unlikely. 

Just like everywhere else there is a very vocal minority of fringe ideology (on both sides too, especially with the anti-vaxxers). You're just as likely to run into a hardcore leftist nutjob as a hardcore right wing nutjob.  But most people are just plain normal. It's not that hard to avoid the nutjobs, but unlike an urban area where there is a ton of them, but also a ton of people so you become more desensitized to it, they do stick out more and you are more likely to notice them. 

I wouldn't put too much stock in the Armacost kerfuffle. He's been on the City Council of sequim for more than a decade, and this was his third stint as mayor. He's always run on a pro-development, anti-taxes, platform that the elderly population of sequim liked. Also a mayor in a charter city isn't like it is in other cities, it's a ceremonial role with pretty much no executive power (basically like the difference between prom king and a real king).

"Wife and I moved to WA a few years ago, and we've been on the peninsula for 2 of those years (originally from the SE). I def felt the freeze more in the Seattle area when we lived closer to it, but you still kinda get it up here too.

"The Washington Transplants group, which is still around in a facebook incarnation at least, was confined to Bellingham. Covid has kept me home mostly, too, since moving here unfortunately. I still have friends from the group I'm in touch with but even though you can almost see it from here, Bellingham's a hell of a trip away haha.

It's hard to ever be sure I'm right about my conclusions regarding the social culture here. Making academically true statements about it is difficult, as most of my experience is relative to me. I found that when discussing it with other transplants though, at least some of it is the universal case for east coast transplants and it just gets slightly less so as you proceed west. There's also a north and south component to it as well, which is probably why you didn't experience this in California as much and why it's not called the West Coast freeze haha, though many of the source issues can be found anywhere on the west coast in my experience.

I read this once https://www.seattletimes.com/life/lifestyle/seattle-freeze-forget-making-friends-half-of-washington-residents-dont-even-want-to-talk-to-you/

It's an interesting way of thinking of it. I think that people here are happy with their existing social networks. With that in mind, I began to think of the communication style here as a way of maintaining the equilibrium of their existing group while interacting with outsiders, as opposed to the NY-area style of just being super outgoing and (in my outlook) assuming that the people who get you will continue to get you and thus not go anywhere, even if you introduce new people into the equation.

I'm also of the opinion that the climate/weather here contributes. Vitamin D is a precursor of many hormones and neutransmitters and I personally have to supplement huge doses of it to keep from being deeply depressed for a good chunk of the year. This causes me to wonder what kind of interpersonal social culture would develop in a region where vitamin D deficiency was/is more widespread than elsewhere? I'd assume it would be lower energy as a start. I know how I feel when I haven't been taking vitamin D and it's been cloudy for two months, or the sun hasn't gotten barely above the horizon in three months. Imagining a large group of people all suffering that reality together goes a way to informing my way of thinking of the people here.

Also, that article mentions the Scandinavian thing. Many of the original white settlers here were from that region -- I have to imagine that they brought their culture with them and it, at the very least, informs upon the current culture somehow. Which means personal distance is the norm, whereas elsewhere in my experience it isn't. Combine that with lower energy levels and vague depression due to the darkness for half the year and it really starts to snowball.

Not to mention the passive thing. It's an entire other language, really. When you start having to assume lots of things based on context because people aren't saying anything directly, it just re-sorts what you're doing socially from the ground up. When I first moved here I was downright puzzled by people's reaction to me and my presence. In NJ I was not the most assertive person around by a long shot most of the time and I was considered very ""nice"", forgiving, understanding, etc.

Here, though, sometimes when I'd speak to strangers they'd nearly immediately get this tense look on their face and attempt to exit the conversation as rapidly as they politely could. I always got everything I wanted at work or in interactions with others (works great for REI returns), though it often came with a vague sense that I was resented somehow which made me feel uneasy. I was just expressing what I wanted and it was taken as a demand, though in my mind I was quite prepared to be told no I rarely was. It's quite alienating because no one would explain what I was doing wrong and when asked about it, even among people I seemed to get along with okay, it would be expressed in such vague terms that I couldn't really get how to do anything different.

Also, I think the age of the culture is a factor. In NY there's been many different (white) cultures present for a very long time -- 400 years or so. We've developed many formal methods of address and have deeply standardized some behaviors. I mean, this is largely unconscious for most people and I don't mean to say that everyone's going around just executing standardized forms consciously, heh. 

Here, though, there's only been white people (and thus the current culture) for about 150 years and not nearly so diverse as the east. It's very homogenous. Things tend to be unstructured socially.


Also, in the east it's crowded so things have been reduced to their simplest version to save time.  Here, people seem to be willing to linger in conversation and let things emerge slowly instead of getting right to the point -- combined with a culture that doesn't have many widely standard ""forms"" of communication that would allow you to anticipate any needed communication, this can lead to miscommunication or one party becoming uncomfortable with the rapidity of exchange, etc.

Don't even get me started about the ""talking to the room"" behaviors I've observed in certain group social contexts, either. That's one I haven't completely cracked and have only begun to notice in the last few years.

I think I've begun to ramble. Really you could fill a small book with observations, many of them that might likely not end up being the source of this perceived ""Seattle freeze"" (which is a term too simple for me to like -- I don't really think they're intentionally freezing out outsiders, they're just not a culture that values the influx very highly unless it aligns with their existing network and goals).",t2_c8urn,meta474,0,1617557610.0,0,t1_gtd702u,gtd702u,False,AlphaBetaParkingLot,t3_mjpnv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/mjpnv9/does_the_seattle_freeze_extend_out_to_the/,"Does the ""Seattle Freeze"" extend out to the Peninsula?",/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/mjpnv9/does_the_seattle_freeze_extend_out_to_the/gtd702u/,4,r/olympicpeninsula,1,4

"I lived in Bellingham for 12 years before moving here in October. I'm also originally mostly from the NY area (Though actually more NJ).

Seattle freeze is very real in Bellingham. I've seen signs of it here too, at least in people's style of communication and mannerisms. I have analyzed this phenomenon pretty closely haha. I even started a social group for transplants in order to work around it. 

I definitely have friends that are from Washington, outgoing people definitely do exist here, it's just a fundamentally different culture when it comes to communication and socialization. It also seems far more common to be less outgoing or ""friendly"" in the eastern sense in people with a Scandinavian background, but I've hardly conducted an academic study about that so my conclusions as regards that may be suspect. People are indirect here and will avoid saying ""no"" to things even that's the actual answer. It really is a top to bottom difference, though slight, so even that is kind of a paraphrasing of the different way of thinking. I could go on and on.

The best way I found to make friends from the region was to find a repeating hobby group or social location that didn't require planning to encounter people. I used to hang out at a bike shop in Bellingham that had regular hang outs. Also, certain breweries / pubs were a good bet. I also used to go to a weekly social run organized by a local group. Others have said hobby groups and that's certainly true.

Good luck.

If you want local chicken, rabbit, or duck Springrain Farm is also delicious and located in Hadlock. The Chimacum store sells both. I know Bentgate farm in sequim does a farm share where you can go purchase a whole cow or pig. As for veggies Chi’s in Sequim is awesome and so is Nash’s! Midori farm in Quilcene is another great place to get veggies! Also Red Dog farm in Chimacum is delicious! Bring cash since a lot of those farms use the honor system.

"I have no direct involvement in Clallam County, but I have been in many meetings as it relates to hospital preparedness on the peninsula, so I've spent a decent amount of time looking at reports like this.

Roughly 1/3 of the population lives in Port Angeles and Sequim. Lookup a soil liquefaction map for the county (I looked after I wrote this, they are in the presentation). Sequim is basically all high risk with PA somewhat less so. So with the initial earthquake, a majority of roads and structures could fail.  They are both well within tsunami zones and could see a majority of the population trapped and unable to move inland. Clallam County is divided into distinct areas east/west with multiple bridge failure points that will impair the delivery of aid and evacuation. Total loss of power will kill medically fragile individuals, Oly Medical Center is basically on the waterfront - I'd expect it to be out of commission, if not gone. Moving south into higher land could be impaired by falling trees. While roads like Hurricane Ridge and 101 may be intact, they may not be passable, trapping people in the lower elevations.

The earthquake and tsumani will get a lot of people, but it will be the devestation for weeks and months afterward that will drive the numbers up. It won't be helped by the fact that if Cascadia moves, communities down the west coast will all be suffering similiar problems. You should see the liquifaction maps for my town.",t2_gxikt,Zartanio,0,1604275497.0,0,t1_gauh5oz,gauh5oz,True,MidnightExtension496,t3_jmbe2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/jmbe2k/cascadia_earthquake_impact_on_clallam_county/,Cascadia Earthquake Impact on Clallam County,/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/jmbe2k/cascadia_earthquake_impact_on_clallam_county/gauh5oz/,3,r/olympicpeninsula,0,3

National park roads are usually paved, while forest ones aren't. Forest is mainly on east side of OP, park is west.

If you're moving to Sequim or points west you will be closer to park than forest.

Snows once or twice a year, if you've driven on snow anywhere else you can deal with it, never too bad or lasting for more than 2-3 days.

"Again, it depends on your intended use. Campgrounds with facilities tend to be connected to main roads. Primitive camping tends to be off main roads.

Do you really want to go camping in the winter? It's not a good time unless you have a very specific goal like scoping out a surf spot (which does not require 4x4) or backcountry skiing. No matter the car you get, you will also need to purchase a set of tire chains for any winter mountain travel (it is required by law to carry them), which will get the FWD Fit through just about any highway that hasn't been closed.

It's hard to go wrong with either vehicle. They both hold their value extremely well, slight edge to the Honda there.

">OBVIOUSLY the Forester is far better suited for bad weather and bumpy back country roads... but realistically, how often will I need that?

Why are you asking internet strangers about things that only you could possibly know? 

The answer is that it depends on your needs. If you never imagine yourself going off road, the Fit will be perfectly adequate. It is truly an amazing car on the road. Reliability second to none, and best in class cargo capacity--you can even camp comfortably with two people inside. It gets by fine on mildly rutted roads as well.

If you do like to camp, hike, ski, etc., the Subaru would be the better choice.

"Thanks for the reply! Sounds like there's some options, although I am not sure about hitting up restaurants, bars, and gyms right now. Not sure what the situation is like up there - but while people are in general ""going out"", there's not much in the way of meeting people in bars in SF these days, hah.

Job wise, the plan is to apply for jobs doing remote work. I am currently unemployed and paying rent, amd CA unemployment stopped working, so living with my uncle would be a help financially while I look for work. That way I can also keep the job even if I move around, as I don't want to live with my uncle forever. I also have various personal projects and stuff I've been working on.

TBH, I am expecting it likely I'll come back to SF in \~6 months or so, but who knows - I am open minded about it! It would be a bit of a pain to move back, but not terrible. I'll probably leave 75% of my stuff in storage near SF, at least to start. Also from a Driver's License/voter registration perspective, I am unsure the degree to which I want to find the balance between ""CA resident staying with my Uncle"" to ""WA resident living with my Uncle"".

But one of the things that will determine that is how well I adjust to having less social opportunities, making friends, dating, etc...

"Now that I'm rereading my comment, I'm noticing that I made a mistake in my wording. Let me rephrase that, ""I don't believe that remembering a person solely by the mistakes they made is valid.""

I hope this makes more sense, I don't know much about the life of John Wayne, but for the location to be named ""John Wayne Marina"" should imply that he did something worthy of being remembered that isn't racism. Thus, I believe that invalidating everything that he did in his life because he was racist (what I meant when I said ""mistakes"") is, for lack of a better word, unfair.

I generalized it to ""mistakes"" instead of outright ""because he was racist"" because I tried, likely in vain, to make my viewpoint apply to not just the John Wayne Marina, but to any statue or place that people are trying to rename and/or destroy because the person on question is racist.

"If you're in the mood for Mexican, try Fast Burrito on 1st street. It sounds like a crummy mexamerican joint, but it is the best authentic Mexican in Port Angeles, and the best burritos on the peninsula imo.     


If you're wanting Chinese, Tendies Garden is right next to Fast Burrito on 1st street and is very, very good; I've been eating there for over a decade. Alternatively, Fresh Wok is over on Front street and is just as good, some think it may be better. I prefer Tendies, but I like fresh wok too.  


If you are wanting Italian, go to Bella Italian downtown. It is so, so good. Anyone from the peninsula can attest to their amazingness. 


As someone else commented, Gastro Pub rocks. Best burgers ever, great poutine and appetizers in general.    


There's also a Thai place on 8th street. I've heard good things, but I've never been. I have, however, been to the 8th street bridges grill, and it is amazing. Awesome burgers, GREAT milkshakes. Also, if you wanna just go pick up a burger and a milkshake but want a cheaper alternative than bridges grill, you can go to Frugals. Still great, just not on the same level as 8th street.

> #Forks teen charged with murder
> Prosecuting attorney: Phillip Z. Cowles had been in counseling for expressing homicidal ideations

> *By Jesse Major*

> Wednesday, December 4, 2019 3:50pm

> PORT ANGELES — A 17-year-old, who investigators said admitted to taking a handgun from his mother’s closet before shooting and killing Tristen LeeShawn James Pisani after a party in Forks, has been charged with first-degree murder with a firearm.

> Phillip Z. Cowles, who remains in the Clallam County juvenile detention facility on $1 million bail, appeared in court at Juvenile and Family Services on Wednesday, where he was formally charged with the murder of Pisani, 19.

> Arraignment is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Dec. 13 in Clallam County Superior Court at the Clallam County Courthouse.

> Michele Devlin, chief criminal deputy prosecuting attorney, attempted to persuade Superior Court Judge Brent Basden that Cowles should be shackled before entering the courtroom, citing concerns about his rage.

> She said Cowles had been in counseling for expressing homicidal ideations.

> Devlin said Cowles had expressed in August that he was “going to cut up his dog and leave it on the football field,” and that the state had concerns for the safety of those in the courtroom.

> Cowles’ attorney, Harry Gasnick, argued that since Cowles’ arrest Sunday he has been a “model inmate” and that the circumstances that led to his rage Sunday — alcohol and bullying — were not present in the courtroom.

> What was present, he said, were plenty of law enforcement officers.

> “Given those considerations and the presence of law enforcement,” Basden allowed Cowles to enter the courtroom unshackled.

> “I’m not finding in this setting at this time, given the presence of law enforcement, that there’s a risk,” Basden said.

> According to court papers, Cowles admitted to paramedics, doctors and law enforcement officers that he shot and killed Pisani after being called a “tweek” and a series of antagonizing texts that “pushed him too far.”

> Witnesses told investigators that Cowles showed up to a party at Pisani’s home on the 1300 block of Big Burn Place in Forks and was acting strange. When Pisani asked Cowles why he was “tweaking,” Cowles said not to call him a tweaker, according to court records.

> Cowles left the party with a friend and was dropped off at his home, court papers say.

> Cowles told investigators he took a knife, a revolver and .44 caliber ammunition from the closet in his mother’s bedroom before walking 1.7 miles back to the party.

> “I knew what I was going to do,” Cowles said during an interview with investigators, according to court records.

> Witnesses said Cowles went back to the house after the party had ended, aimed the gun at Pisani’s head and said “don’t call me a tweaker,” before firing the gun.

> Cowles told investigators that Pisani told him to “go ahead, do it.”

> “I remember the rage overtook me,” Cowles said, according to court records. “As soon as I pulled that trigger. I didn’t even have to hear that sound. I knew what I did.”

> That’s when witnesses detained Cowles. They struggled for the firearm and one person held Cowles at gunpoint while kicking him in the head.

> “When they bully a guy to no extent eventually he going to do something,” Cowles said, according to court papers. “They bullied me. I shouldn’t have done what I did. I had to do something.”",t2_6re60,JustNilt,0,1575536678.0,0,t1_f9phrdk,f9phrdk,False,PeninsulaDailyNews,t3_e68a9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/e68a9h/forks_teen_charged_with_murder_peninsula_daily/,Forks teen charged with murder | Peninsula Daily News,/r/olympicpeninsula/comments/e68a9h/forks_teen_charged_with_murder_peninsula_daily/f9phrdk/,2,r/olympicpeninsula,0,2

"His point is this: anyone that spent quite a bit of time in the Forks / Hoh area would understand the job situation in Forks.  

To claim that you spend a lot of time in and around Forks but not be aware of the employment situation is, in the poster's opinion, something strange to brag about.  

You have a single grocery / general store, a pizza place, a few other restaurants, a seasonal tourist industry, fishing gear, guides, a prison, a rock quarry, a couple motels, a post office, and a couple gas stations along with a few watering holes.  

Looking for something in the IT Security Industry? Forks is a far cry from Seattle, Austin, San Jose, and even Des Moines... if you told someone from Forks you were in IT Security, they would suggest that the prison would hire former security guards.

"Everyone recommends Nextdoor Gastropub, and it’s really good, but there are equally good options - often with less of a wait and less expensive.

Also in PA: Midtown (lunch/dinner/drinks), Spruce (lunch/dinner/drinks), Granny’s (old style cafe which will be right on the highway, def the closest to Sutherland - not sure what it’s like under the new owner but if it’s anything like it used to be it’s a great burger and their soft serve is awesome after a day at the lake), Lake Crescent Lodge (nice dinner), First Street Haven (breakfast/lunch), Bella Italia (niceish dinner/wine), New Day Cafe (breakfast/lunch), Fast Burrito (sounds like cheap Tex mex fare, but it’s actually really good), Coyote BBQ (only been once so I can’t speak to consistently, but it was good brisket).

As for your itinerary, it all sounds very doable and fun to me.  It’ll be busy, but I’m pretty sure I’ve done similar stints which included bigger hikes, so you guys oughta be fine.  

And the last commenter who said it was the middle of nowhere is being a little hyperbolic.  I don’t know if that dude is from around here, but I grew up in PA and your plan seems very reasonable to me.  You’ll be a 25 minute drive from Port Angeles proper (on a flat highway with little traffic) while out at Sutherland.  You won’t have a ton of shops or restaurants in your immediate vicinity (besides Lake Crescent Lodge and Granny’s), but you won’t be stranded.  Forks will be the longest drive, and it should be an hour or so from where you’re staying.

"Hike to Marymere falls is moderately traveled, goes along lake Crescent for a little bit, and is a well maintained and fairly flat trail. Probably 3 miles round trip. Add that in to whatever you plan. Park at the Lake Crescent / Storm King ranger station and hike from the parking lot. Nearly every other lake aside from Crescent and Lena are somewhat short but a lot of elevation change.  

PJ Lake is close but may have June snow problems. It's around 1000 feet down over a few miles - pretty steep.  

Lake Ozette loop is 9  miles of boardwalk and only has about 100 foot of elevation change. It's basically 3 miles from Lake Ozette to the Pacific, three miles along the Pacific and three miles back to where you started. The route to and from the Pacific is all boardwalk and a leisurely stroll pace would get it done.  Even if you went from the lake to the ocean and then back it would be six miles.

"Hate to put this on the internet but the word is out on TripAdvisor anyway, but AFAIC, Kalaloch Lodge on the coast near forks is where it’s at. On site restaurant that’s good, close enough to the rainforest, coast (obviously), lake crescent, etc. Hurricane Ridge is great and all, but if you stay in that area you’re about 3-4 hours away from everything else. Well, to be fair you’re kind of always 3-4 hours away from the next thing anyway in Olympic.  But I was more interested in the coast and rainforest so Kalaloch was an ideal location for me. 

Assuming you want the full Olympic experience and not just the beautiful mountain views. Plus then you don’t have to stay in Port Angeles. 

My favorites were 2nd Beach, Ruby Beach, Quinault, and of course the Hoh River, which took my breath away. Loved the ridge hike at hurricane ridge, too.

"A lot of good ideas here. There is still a good amount of snow in the back country. Go to the visitor center in port angeles and ask about some route feasibility. I live in Port Angeles and just did this yesterday.

High divide is 17 miles and easily doable outside of too much snowpack. Sun up to sun down. Crazy views of hoh and blue glacier on Olympus.

The bogachiel is a sister river to the Hoh and has no people at all on it. Massive massive trees and moss for days. The trail connects to high divide after 20+ miles so you can hike out and back as far as you please. I don’t know the status of this trail though. The hoh trail will be in fantastic condition. 

If you hit a beach (which is essential: alpine, old growth, coast) go to rialto and head past hole in the wall. The people dwindle off to nothing north of the chilean monument and thats only 4 miles in. Mind the tides, there are impassible points that you can avoid with a topo map and tide chart.You can get pretty deep north. I did the whole north coast last year and its amazing how every beach is so different.

You should also do ODT, but skip past hurricane ridge and drive to obstruction point. Its the furthest you can go in the park driving-8 miles past hurricane ridge. 16 mile out and back to grand pass is crazy beautiful, lots of elevation change.

Basically, stay on the north peninsula. There is the most access to each ecosystem and the interior alpine. And take a lazy day up storm king and have a drink at lake crescent lodge. See a few waterfalls. Have a beer at the lazy moon craft tavern, maybe I’ll cheers you.
