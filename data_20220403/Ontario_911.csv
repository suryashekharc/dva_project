"The NDP are.

That's a common misconception that the NDP are bad with money.  If we actually look at times they formed provincial gov'ts we can see that are pretty [fiscally responsible](https://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/toby-sanger/2015/09/ndp-far-have-most-fiscally-responsible-record-any-federal-party).

* NDP governments have balanced their budgets 40 per cent (or 22 of the 55) years they've been in office, compared to just 33 per cent for Conservatives and 23 per cent for Liberal governments.
* Deficits under NDP governments have averaged 0.5 per cent of GDP compared to 1.1 per cent for Conservative governments and 1.3 per cent for Liberals.
* Average debt-to-GDP ratios are similar for NDP and Conservative governments at 24 per cent, lower than the average under Liberal governments at 35 per cent, but Conservative governments have increased debt/GDP ratios at a higher rate than either Liberal or NDP governments.
* Far from being big spenders, NDP governments have actually averaged slightly lower spending as a share of their economies than either Liberal or Conservative governments at 21.6 per cent compared to 22.2 per cent for Conservative and 24.6 per cent for Liberal governments.
* NDP governments have also not been big taxers: their revenues as a share of their economies have averaged 21 per cent , similar to Conservatives and lower than the average under Liberal governments at 23.4 per cent.

The science doesn't back this up. An N95 mask will, even without fit-testing, reduce inhaled virus particles by \~80%. If you're vaccinated, this allows far more activities to fall into a ""reasonably low risk"" exposure range.

I wouldn't recommend going to the gym, or choir practice, or any other indoor activity where people are breathing heavily, but I see very low risk going shopping for groceries if you're vaccinated and masked.

"It would encourage people to vote their interests at least and be more representative of the actual population when forming government. I forgot to mention in my original post that that one vote for party would go into a seperate pool of seats specifically for that vote for regional representation. There's a lot of PPC voters who vote Conservative to keep Liberals out, Conservatives who vote Liberal to stop NDP or NDP who vote Liberal to stop Conservatives. Then there's the green party that gets millions of votes and A system like this would provide more representation along how people vote. It would be essentially be a more fair system for all and stop allowing majority governments where the minority of the population gets to call the shots like with what we have in Ontario right now.

Here's a short video from fairvote.ca from a few years back on how it works

https://youtu.be/D3guVBhKmDc

I missed your part on ranked ballots. That actually would make things worse. 

Fair vote has a great article talking about that too. Australia's politics are a disaster because of it. The ranked ballot that the Liberals at both the federal and provincial levels keep pushing for sets up a system where they are more likely to win and creates a more divided government. I don't know about you but I want to see a government where NDP, Conservatives, Liberals, Greens, and whoever else at whatever level all have to work together to pass legislation.

No, Ford created those particular messes.

There's no basis for ""Trudeau pulling the strings"".  If someone bases their voting decisions off of baseless conspiracy theories, then there isn't much of a point to having a rational conversation.

And my point isn't about whether Ford would be better or worse or whatever regarding lockdowns, but that he was responsible for them.  Some people believe it was Trudeau, and Ford played no part because he's Conservative and Trudeau is Liberal.  But that's not the case.

"If you're asking in general for Ontario then the slang is really only sort-of accurate for Listowel and surrounding counties in south-west Ontario, and fairly exaggerated at that. The Hockey players are probably the most accurate Canada-wide but the specifics of the terminology vary according to region.  The biggest difference between Listowel and the rest of Ontario is that there is way more German immigrant influence down there both  both generally and with the specific religious/farming groups like the Mennonites. One reason why Oktoberfest is so big down there is the large German heritage around Kitchener-Waterloo and into the farming country.  The cultural mix is sort of United Empire Loyalist and German and Mohawk indigenous. The rest of Ontario is pretty different. Northern-East Ontario from Sudbury north has a lot of French influence, Eastern Ontario is far more Scottish with some French, the Ottawa Valley in Ontario and Quebec west of Ottawa has a very large percentage of protestant northern Irish around Ottawa and catholic Irish further up.  The rural accents and culture in the Valley are way closer to something you'd hear in the Maritimes than Southern Ontario, particularly on the Quebec side west of Ottawa where the English-speaking Irish have been fairly insular since the 1800's. Not exactly Trailer Park Boys, but much closer than Letterkenny. If you're looking for cultural accuracy Corner Gas is way closer to a Canadian-standard small-town life/accent than Letterkenny for most of Ontario and the Western provinces. Tailer Park Boys is truer for the Eastern provinces (minus most of Quebec). I'd say English Canada is 75% Corner Gas, 20% Trailer Park Boys and 5% Letterkenny. With the recent FUBAR/TPB crossover it probably ups the TPB percentage a bit as FUBAR is far more true-to-life across Canada than Letterkenny. For that matter, Strange Brew/Bob and Doug MacKenzie are way more accurate for typical rural Ontario/Candian hosers, even though it was made almost 40 years ago.",t2_d7ne0fzu,ZookeepergamePure586,0,1648998634.0,0,t1_i38bl3l,i38bl3l,True,heyasfuck,t3_tv06xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/tv06xk/hey_bros_i_wanted_to_ask_how_accurate_is/,Hey bros i wanted to ask how accurate is Letterkenny?

>Prior to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the efficacy of community mask wearing to reduce the spread of respiratory infections was controversial because there were no solid relevant data to support their use. During the pandemic, the scientific evidence has increased. Compelling data now demonstrate that community mask wearing is an effective nonpharmacologic intervention to reduce the spread of this infection, especially as source control to prevent spread from infected persons, but also as protection to reduce wearers‚Äô exposure to infection.

"> Anti-democracy: Notwithstanding clause and overruling municipalities, including how they vote for their mayors

That's politics, that's what they all do. Hasn't affected me none.

Lockdowns would have been even worse with the other parties in charge, Trudeau was probably pulling the strings anyway.

"It is absolutely nimbyism, but that also doesn't remove blame from government about being complicit in planning this nightmare. 

Environmental rules are a convoluted mix and a headache to sort through, though not at all a waste of time. They are the only thing keeping every block of trees between Toronto and Barrie from being demolished for houses. 

The biggest problem there is the government has made vague, multi-layered sets of environmental rules for every new landowner to ""figure out"" for development. Almost every new project with naturey things on the property needs an environmental consulting firm to do surveys and make them a report (a long process) discussing which of the province's and minicipality's prioritized natural features are present, and if the development will or won't impact them. Not only is this an opaque process before you get into it, it's also something that people aren't aware of when they buy new land. And a property may be well-known to be filled with things that prevent development, but the municipality will not flag it as undevelopable.  In fact, the real estate industry makes a pretty penny off of selling undevelopable tracts of land to ever-changing new owners who are either completely oblivious to the restrictions on the property, or think they have the 'special sauce' to make this development work. Because instead of the province or municipality providing clear, set, top-down yes-or-no mapping , it's left to some environmental firm to produce another report and waste someone else's time.

The rules themselves are (sometimes) actually important, and in some cases they are aligned with homeowner protection (preventing developers from building int wetlands watercourse and floodplains also prevents flooded basements, property damage and in some cases risk to safety). In other cases they are the only thing keeping a mirrorworld suburb monstrosity from removing literally every forest block. Some of the endangered species legislation is extremely squirrely though, with outrageous protections for some species that make no sense, which overshadows other species that are extremely rare and definitely worth protecting. 

Butternut is a great example - strongly protected, expensive to remove; it may be declining rapidly as a species but at the moment it is still common on the landscape. It causes landowners huge headaches but most of the trees you end up saving will end up dying from canker disease. The rules around it are onerous and give a bad reputation to endangered species legislation that protects other extremely rare species that better deserve protection.",t2_moel9,foxmetropolis,0,1648995670.0,0,t1_i3851rn,i3851rn,False,nimobo,t3_tukae3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ontario/comments/tukae3/adam_zivo_singlefamily_zoning_remains_untouchable/,"Adam Zivo: Single-family zoning remains untouchable in Ontario, so house prices will keep soaring",/r/ontario/comments/tukae3/adam_zivo_singlefamily_zoning_remains_untouchable/i3851rn/,1,r/ontario,0,1

"No, only that the decision to extend cloth mask mandates is mostly catering to the anxious and isn't overly based on science.

Those who are actually concerned were already wearing at least medical masks or KN95 masks, and will probably continue to do so in the absence of mask mandates.

Those who are just doing it for the sake of following the rules were wearing cloth masks with varying degrees of care about fit.  The efficacy of these masks is probably not enough to make much of a difference.  When HWDSB decided to extend the mandate they also directed people to the form to request an exemption.

"Ok so JT needs to provide more money. Makes sense no? 

Monetary policy dictates that a nation with a sovereign currency can, in real terms, literally print money that matches the nations productive output without damaging inflation. A province can not do that. 

I have no issue with federal government deficits. Federal deficits literally equate to more money in our pockets. But provincial deficits do not. Ford can only spend what he is given. Either he adds a levy to the cost of child, which in turn would not allow for 10$ and he would lose support of the federal government to implement this plan, or he spends what he has been given which allows for the wages to be paid that can be afforded with in the plan. 

This sub is so reactive to anything anti Ford. I‚Äôm not a conservative, I don‚Äôt vote for Ford. I‚Äôm a liberal, and I vote for Trudeau. But the plan is Trudeaus. He literally ran on this plan in the last election. 

Voters have to hold those accountable that are responsible for the outcomes we see. We can not allow division distract us from that and point our outrage in the wrong places.
