" I mentioned this in another comment, but between Cedar Rapids, Marion and Hiawatha there is about 180k people. There is about 11k people in that facebook group, which a large portion are probably just lurkers, bots, or dead accounts. The remaining active users are in 2 categories, they care about his shit, they don‚Äôt care, or they hate his shit. 

He‚Äôd need to influence at least 16% of the entire group to even have an influence on 0.01% of the amount of people in the Cedar Rapids area, which I highly doubt, maybe a few % but not 16%. The minority is just loud.

"As a Cedar Rapids lurker but Iowa City citizen, there are real costs to keeping Mann open. It is in a neighborhood that is mostly college students and few single family homes. The results of this is a much [larger attendance area](https://www.iowacityschools.org/cms/lib/IA01903939/Centricity/Domain/69/Elementary%20Boundaries%202019-2020%20V1-8.pdf) for very few students. Class sizes there can be extremely small, because of the large areas it covers. By small, it isn't uncommon for class sizes under 15 students in the building and no more than two teachers per grade level. The net result of this ends up being larger class sizes for the rest of the district and duplicative costs. The district could have easily built a very large elementary school on Longfellow's land that would have been much more cost efficient in the long run.

At the end of the day, consolidation is a necessary cost control because of the legislature. It allows for greater economies of scale on staffing and class sizes along with low-emissions buildings. These savings are then applied in allowing for more staffing through lower costs. Given the nature of the Iowa legislature and the lack of funding to meet inflation, building consolidation and new buildings are one of the few ways of controlling costs and lowering class sizes. As a parent, I for one would rather have my child in a small class as opposed to a pretty old building.",t2_ik9uzl3z,dingliscious,0,1648932101.0,0,t1_i35d8m9,i35d8m9,True,agreatfartar,t3_tqiseb,https://www.reddit.com/r/cedarrapids/comments/tqiseb/iowa_city_upgrades_schools_at_less_than_half_the/,Iowa City upgrades schools at less than half the cost of Cedar Rapids plan,/r/cedarrapids/comments/tqiseb/iowa_city_upgrades_schools_at_less_than_half_the/i35d8m9/,1,r/cedarrapids,0,1

While the city can recoup its money through hotel - motel taxes, the small, local businesses who did work for NewBo Evolve and never got paid are out of options. Go Cedar Rapids still owes $800,000

"Still I completely agree with you. Actually the part of San Diego I‚Äôm from is out in the desert so it wasn‚Äôt the city area.

I say all of this to simply say that unless you‚Äôre a superstore your business in this area probably kind of sucks. I don‚Äôt say that just to be critical or insulting but because this area just feels like crap.

I was able to assimilate to the seasons fairly well, and I‚Äôm actually not even that hard up for not having things like Nordstrom‚Äòs Macy‚Äôs and other normal retailers.

"Gonna be a bit of a rant but also a glowing review.  My kiddo is in Linn-Mar's Pre-K program and it's great.  The teachers do an amazing job and are very communicative over the app and in person about how each day goes, and what they worked on.  He's always excited when he gets home to tell us what they worked on that day.  I will say, my kiddo does not have an IEP at Pre-K age.  He'll have one eventually due to signs of what may turn out to be ADHD (like me) but not yet.  

Unfortunately, my daughter was going to get shafted on enrollment this coming year because of the change to the Open Enrollment ""Lottery"" rather than preferential to those in the area.  We ended up finding a house in a different state that we're moving to (unrelated) and it has more problems in that area than we had here, but open enrollment impacting the ability of in-district kids to get spots in Pre-K programs is problematic.  

Only reason I say all that is I'd love for you to please get involved with your district's meetings to try to make the district be one you want to be in, rather than just moving your kid to the one that is better.

"During the Facilities Planning sessions in 2017/18, Superintendent  
Brad Buck and the administration fell under the spell of Rob Schwarz (RSP Associates) from Johnson County Kansas.¬†  
Mr. Schwarz promotes the Suburban school model.¬† Large Schools, Bussed Students.¬† Large land use.¬† The model works great in a rapidly expanding suburban area with a wealthy tax base.¬†  
Members of the Facilities Task force toured schools in Johnson County Kansas and were transfixed by what they saw.¬† The schools toured were in the richest school districts in the richest county in Kansas.  
So where is Brad Buck now?¬†

expanding west end fits the suburban model very well.¬† Most of the students are bussed anyway, right?¬† There‚Äôs plenty of land.¬† On top of that, Coolidge and Jackson were poorly constructed and not widely loved.¬†  
This plan is not going to play out well when some of the healthy  
established neighborhood schools are officially slated for removal.¬† To make way for that day, the Administration has throttled funding for repair of cosmetic issues in the neighborhood schools.¬† Johnson, Hoover, Kenwood, Grant Wood, Erskine, Cleveland, Taylor, Wright.¬†  (Go look at them!)  
They all look tatty and it‚Äôs on purpose.¬†  
It‚Äôs called Demolition By Neglect and it is shameful!

"I understand that other school districts have gone through different scenarios of renovations and consolidations.  There are examples of schools consolidating and leaving behind defunct schools that deteriorate further, and there are examples of consolidations where poorer students and families are worse off.

I stayed informed and involved in the facility planning process several years ago and have stayed informed this time around.  I'm not sure how, in any way, the school district has considered the health of neighborhoods.  ""Maybe"" vacated schools will turn into something else.  I've heard that.  Some years ago when I was asking the CFO about neighborhoods, impacts on kids and families, etc., I was only told that the district has the money to bus kids.  Based on discussions a few years ago and recently, I am also aware that the district is not choosing to consolidate / rebuild / remove schools based on safe routes to schools.  

You and others also seem to imply that what I'm advocating for is for run-down, outdate schools to not be improved--to be places where the ""physical health"" of students and teachers deteriorates.  I'm not sure why you are making this point.  Of course I want schools to be updated and renovated and safe and healthy.  All of my points are basically about family and neighborhood health.

Other comments said other districts may be different.  They don't know if they are different.  It's been rightly suggested that renovations in previous years would be more expensive today; that goes without saying.  

I understand the district is attempting to make a complex decision.  I am arguing here that they have not considered many variables, and they have also not presented their case in a way that should be taken seriously.  They have not reasonably addressed concerns and provided evidence to ally peoples' concerns.  Because they have not--and this is similar to comments in this thread--they respond to reasonable concerns and requests for more information by presenting total misdirections.  

Knowing that consolidations will likely continue, the least that the school district can do is offer a serious plan for what will happen to vacant schools.  They have not yet, likely because, as usual, they don't have a grasp on schools and impacts to neighborhoods.  Amid all this and their confidence for going forward, literally making a plan for what to do with vacant schools should be a priority.",t2_39st563l,agreatfartar,0,1648605530.0,0,t1_i2nvusc,i2nvusc,False,agreatfartar,t3_tqiseb,https://www.reddit.com/r/cedarrapids/comments/tqiseb/iowa_city_upgrades_schools_at_less_than_half_the/,Iowa City upgrades schools at less than half the cost of Cedar Rapids plan,/r/cedarrapids/comments/tqiseb/iowa_city_upgrades_schools_at_less_than_half_the/i2nvusc/,1,r/cedarrapids,0,1

"Others in this thread have pointed out differences between the two districts, so hopefully that has helped your understanding of different views on the issue. I think the district has considered the health of neighborhoods in their decision-making process. But, the physical health of people in these old buildings, and all of the other problems with them (again, as others have pointed out) have outweighed that.

Another district I lived in several years ago also went through the process of consolidating elementary schools. There was an uproar there, too, about how neighborhoods would be affected, parents upset that their kids would have to ride a school bus instead of walking, etc. The district went through with the plan...and everything turned out to be fine. The neighborhoods are still good. The kids have survived getting to school in ways other than walking. It's basically a non-issue there now.

I think a big part of this is that change is hard, especially when it involves places that have been around for a long time and hold a lot of meaning for people. The district is trying to make a decision that will impact a lot of people for a long time, and there are definitely pros and cons to different plans.

One of the schools that I believe is going to be closed it Grant Wood Elementary.  GW is about a mile from Erskine.  So kids who currently walk to GW and live less than a mile west of GW will now be walking two+ miles to Erskine.  They won't be bussing them unless they are further than 2 miles unless they change their current policy. 

Currently, we take an elementary kid and a HS kid to school because we don't qualify for the bus.  I think there are going to be a LOT more people driving kids to school if they're consolidated.  It's also usually a major PITA to take them in/pick them up because there are already cars lined up around the block (blocking traffic).  Erskine is not set up to deal with the number of cars there now.

"Interesting insight on the cost of Mann.  One of my biggest issues is that the article (and the OP's post headline) implies that renovations would be half the cost of building new, yet they fail to provide two critical pieces of information: 1) year the projects were built to compare construction escalation, 2) sizes of the two projects.

I did some digging and West Willow, per the CR assessor website, is 97,000 SF.  Horace Mann, according to the contractor website, is 51,000 SF.  So while this article implies that one can save half the cost by renovating, the reality is not true.  Horace Mann is half the size, so it is not an apples to apples comparison.  And if it would be $20 million today, that means you are getting less building for more money vs. a significantly larger West Willow Elementary at $24 million that is brand new and doesn't have all the deferred maintenance issues.

"In the time I spent learning about the facility master planning process several years ago, the district's information was very slanted in my experience.  They did point to one school district in KC that consolidated and liked it.  Not sure who liked it, but CR school district liked it.  They didn't point to any other examples of renovations that have worked and provided modern, adequate services.  It's not cherry picking to look at your closest comparable neighbor; it'd be cherry picking not to.  

CR schools says small schools cannot work; IC says they can.  CR schools could renovate schools and previously provided those cost estimates.  The cost estimates were totally opaque, and from a CR school staff, they included installing geothermal in the renovations, which is a great way to make the renovation cost higher, even though geothermal is not required. Their projections for new school costs were low, and their first rebuilt school already went over budget.

I don't want students learning in terrible environments.  That should go without saying. I want schools to be in excellent conditions, and a renovation can accomplish that.  And a renovation can support the neighborhood, kids, and families with the fewest resources more.  If CR schools disagrees, they should at least study the issues and come to that conclusion transparently, but they don't have the awareness or ability to do that.  This article here is coming 5 years late, and it shows how little CR schools attempted to research and/or share publicly.

If the school district is going to build new schools and abandon old ones, they should have a much more serious and actual plan in place that says what can or will happen to the schools--at least have partners committed and the school district committed to making sure their abandoned property doesn't harm the neighborhoods their in and hurt families and kids.

"I think that people don't want their schools to be closed down, and I don't think the CR school district has been honest about the need to close schools.  They have said is that it's impossible to operate small schools, and this is a nearby example that shows that it is possible.  How do they do it and get the resources to students who need it in small schools?  I'm not sure, but IC seems to have an idea.

CR school district hasn't ever made a serious effort to research, discuss, or plan for neighborhood impacts.  They could do this, and they have not.  What is the impact to students' physical activity in the morning if there's a large reduction in kids walking and biking?  Physical activity in the morning is really important to student learning.  What is the impact to home values and neighborhood vitality?  CR schools doesn't know, but there's plenty of research on this topic.  Why can IC renovate a 1914 school on a small urban lot, and CR cannot?  If CR must abandon a school, why don't they make concrete plans first on what will happen to the school rather than just giving it a few wishes (maybe a senior center, maybe multi-family, maybe a non-profit makers space, etc.)?  

Neighborhoods should be worried, because an abandoned school will harm the neighborhood, families, kids, and those with the least.  The CR school district could take this seriously and make a serious plan--and they have chosen not to.  I don't now why this is, but it seems like they either lack the awareness to appreciate this and find partners who can address it, or it is negligence.  They do talk about it with wishful ""maybes"" or the condescending ""supposals"" and apparently think this should allay peoples' justified worries.

"Good points on that.  What seems different between the two is that Iowa City says their 100+ year old schools have another 100 years in them, and they also say small schools can work.  CR says neither of those are true. 

When the facility master planning came up several years ago, I saw the costs for renovations. They were in the ballpark of the Horace Mann renovation in Iowa City.  Knowing a few people in the school's facility team here, I also learned that they included geothermal by default in every renovation cost estimation.  That pushed the cost higher and helped make the case to build new.  

It was all pretty opaque to the public.  The school district also didn't even appear to have the vocabulary to address impacts on the community.  Many school districts across the country have consolidated, and many have done so at a major cost to the community--home values decrease, far fewer kids can walk (physical activity before school is hugely important to learning), discussions about the abandoned school buildings were completely whimsical (maybe it could be x or y, as if it didn't matter to actually find out and they could just be hopeful).

You could be right that IC school district has buildings that have had more renovations over 100 years, though we don't have that evidence here, and previous CR school district cost estimations for renovations were similar to Horace Mann (from what I remember, apologies for lack of citation).  There is evidence here that IC school district somehow knows how to operate small schools into the future, and CR says that is not possible.  That to me shows a lack of transparent research and creativity.  

CR school district says there are teachers running to each small school right now providing specialized attention/education/therapy for small numbers of students.  Rather than demolishing 8 schools to build huge schools that require the bussing of tons of students, why not bus a small number of students needing higher aid to schools with the resources?

"This article feels very slanted and doesn't objectively look at whether the current buildings in Cedar Rapids function as intended and if it would be cost effective to renovate.  They went out of their way to visit an Iowa City school--yet it seems like they did little to no research on the condition of the Cedar Rapids schools in question.  They talked with a retired facilities director for the Iowa City district; did they interview anyone from CRCSD to draw these conclusions that renovating is the cheaper route to go?

I went to middle school in a 1912 three story building.  It was bad enough as a middle schooler trying to get between classes on three different floors--I can't imagine an elementary school student doing it.  We had plaster falling down from the ceiling in study hall, asbestos material everywhere, and there were even gaps forming between the floors and walls where you could slip a pencil through and it would fall to the room below.  In the dead of winter you still had to open windows because the antique steam heating system would fry one half of the room, yet if you were sitting near the windows you froze.  There was no sprinkler system, so if there was a fire there would have been no way to control the blaze (and goes back to the issue of trying to get smaller children out of a multi-story building safely).  The building was historic and did have a cool factor...but it was simply not functional as a space for educating kids.

My rural hometown figured out *back in the 90's* that it was more cost-effective to consolidate three elementary buildings into one large elementary.  It was sad to see the old ones go, but the new building was such a better learning environment.  Better lighting, better temperature control, better technology.

With that said, I am for saving historic buildings, and if the district can figure out a way to sell these historic properties to a private developer to be converted into housing, it would probably be a win-win for all sides.",t2_eluek5t,bluehorseshoe87,0,1648521989.0,0,t1_i2io2s9,i2io2s9,False,agreatfartar,t3_tqiseb,https://www.reddit.com/r/cedarrapids/comments/tqiseb/iowa_city_upgrades_schools_at_less_than_half_the/,Iowa City upgrades schools at less than half the cost of Cedar Rapids plan,/r/cedarrapids/comments/tqiseb/iowa_city_upgrades_schools_at_less_than_half_the/i2io2s9/,8,r/cedarrapids,0,8

"It is not clear to me if this is truly an apples to apples comparison.

If Iowa City had proactively done asbestos abatement years ago those things are now not dragging on renovation costs anymore and allow for future work to be done far more cheaply and safely.

"So, for what it's worth, CR teacher pay is published yearly in The Gazette. CR's teacher pay is not bad by any stretch of the imagination. Check it out. I think we *are* putting pay toward good teachers. You could debate all day whether we're getting quality teachers from the amount of $ spent on them, but again, if CRCSD's getting 'bad' teachers, it's certainly not because the pay is bad.


As for the buildings, it costs about the same amount of $ to heat/electric/cool/etc. a building that serves 600 students as one that serves 200 students. Most of CRCSD's Elementary schools are similar in size. It is not a good use of resources (both $$ and personnel) to be maintaining a building of less than 200 students.


As for restaurants, which has little to do with how a school district spends its money, there was recently a story on KCRG about this: https://www.kcrg.com/video/2022/03/15/local-restaurants-outnumber-chains-cedar-rapids/. 62% of restaurants in CR are locally owned / non-chain, and 60% of those opened in the last 10 years.

That person knows what that flag stands for, that person knows what they are doing. It's not anyone else's job to teach others. If they think the flag isn't a issue to wear in a public park and in a company vehicle then they sure wont care about a photo.

I sure am grateful that now I know that there is at least one person at this company that has no problem parading themselves in a flag that was fighting to the death to enslave people of color.

There‚Äôs a transmit frequency and a receive frequency. Everybody talks to the repeater on the transmit freq and the repeater repeats what it hears on the receive frequency. These can sometimes be the same frequency. Some repeaters require tones to be played before they accept a transmission to repeat. These are called CTCSS tones. Menu 11 is R-CTS to set receive CTCSS tone but generally you can leave this set to none. Menu 13 is T-CTS which is the important one to access the repeater. At least for the Baofeng UV-5R.

"I asked an officer about this once and learned they never turn their vehicles off if they park them and are sitting there or go inside for a meeting/event/misc.  They have a load of equipment inside that would kill the vehicle battery if the vehicle turns off.

It's very unfortunate, and I think if you haven't noticed this before, you'll start noticing that empty cop cars are always running (I'll assume it's when the cop is on-duty rather than off).

There is [Idle Reduction Technology](https://afdc.energy.gov/case/3076) available that's effectively a large battery pack that can keep equipment running when the engine is turned off.  ROI is 0.5-2 years from what I've read.  This should no doubt be standard.
