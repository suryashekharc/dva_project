"Just a warning, stay away from adopting from a local business called “the daily stroll.” The owner Bryn rescues dogs from Georgia and brings them up here to be adopted. A very noble act, but she doesn’t care about the dogs at all only about the money; She’s illegally adopting them out so she can’t put them on petfinder and only adopts out to local people no matter the fit. I tried to adopt from her and when it didn’t work out she screamed at me on the phone that I was traumatizing the dog for doing a trial and tried to guilt me into keeping him. She’s a horrible person. Adopting is really hard right now but it’s worth waiting and going through an actual rescue/agency.

"Hi, neighbor — welcome to Brookline! 

This subreddit is pretty quiet, so you might not find very many active points of connection here — the Brookline Townwide Discussion group on Facebook is more active but also…it’s Facebook, so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ 

In the past, I’ve found that Meetup.com is pretty good for finding local people who like things that you like. For example, I don’t know if you’re musical at all, but ukulele groups are generally extremely welcoming and usually pretty goofy/fun, and open to all levels of playing (I joined one years back when I had only been playing for 2 weeks)! Many uke groups are still virtual, but some of them are doing occasional in-person meetups: https://www.meetup.com/BostonUke/

There’s also a non-‘scene’ LGBTQ+ group that seems like it’s geared towards making friends:
https://www.meetup.com/GayBoston/
And of course, there are plenty of other specific-interest local Meetup groups that might work better for you.

"Wait, they are racist because your partner made a bunch of disingenuous charts?

Here are several things that have not been taken into account in the utter abuse of ""stats"" these charts present:

1. It takes into account 3 months of an institution that has existed for almost 100 years. 
2. The institutional issue of minority led movies in Hollywood. What percentage of first run films that came out during this time actually had a BIPOC lead? Especially during ""Oscar Season,"" which has been historically over representing of white male voices.
3. The fact that he is using a metric that he decided upon for his charts. It seems an awful lot like he is walking backwards into a conclusion as opposed to unbiased look at data. It would help to be provided with the entire data set and for a clear and concise list of parameters that are being used and why.
4. ""uplift the voices of **all** races,   
**ethnicities**, **gender identities**, **economic statuses**, and **abilities**; and   
envision the changes we wish to see in our society."" Way are the films that focus on other gender identities, sexual orientations, etc being ignored in these ""racist"" charts. What about non-english language films from around the world, or movies that may have a white cast but have a director/writer/etc who is a person of color, or other minority? But I guess that doesn't fit the narrative that is trying to be created.
5. What about the availability of films? A lot of movies shown at both theaters are second run films dating back a 100+ years. There are only a limited number of prints available at certain times across the the country.
6. How do either of these theaters compare to other theaters of the same mission statement, and/or to ALL theaters in the area?

But none of that is addressed, just like it isn't addressed why they were blocked by the Coolidge online? I have to believe that an appropriate questioning of the institution would not lead to a blocking. And seeing as how you're so quick to immediately call everyone a racist says a whole lot about how those interactions with the Coolidge probably actually went down.

Anyone can cherry pick stats. Looking at today's showings at the Coolidge there are 5 movies. Drive My Car - a Japanese language; Licorice Pizza - white male director/white lead but a woman; Tragedy of MacBeth - white male director/black male lead; Parallel Mothers - Spanish language film/Spanish male director/the top 4 roles played by Spanish women; and The Piano - directed by a Kiwi woman/the top 2 stars are women. But according to these ""charts"" diversity would only be counted for Denzel Washington?

There are real issues in this world that need to be addressed, this does not appear to be high on the list or even possibly an issue at all due to flawed and biased stats. You two could spend you time and efforts on an actual problem that needs addressing. But looking at your prior immature responses I am sure that I will just be called racist. Maybe some self reflection on how you both interact with people would be a good thing for not only yourselves, but also the causes that you seem to have; and those causes are honorable. I myself am an advocate and ally for all equality, justice, and the lifting of all marginalized groups - but these ""charts"" ain't it.

There are many movies starring POC that they could have shown. Boogie, Emyiofe, and Prisoners of a Ghostland are three examples of recent releases that other independent films showed that the Coolidge did not. If you'd like more examples, I suggest looking at what other indie theaters are showing.

Even if that were true, that is not what the Coolidge is supposed to do. The Coolidge is supposed to **uplift underrepresented voices.** They claim that they do and request donations for this purpose, but then do not follow through on their obligations. 

This is the Coolidge's standard:

The Coolidge screened 119 movies in Q4. Here are the movies that I classified as BIPOC-led for Q4: 
* Candy Man
* Green Knight 
* Civil War (or Who Do We Think We Are?)
* Blue Bayou
* The Rescue
* Blacula
* Night of the Living Dead

Where did I say that? You're just digging yourself deeper.

You're focusing on a theatre that has a movie selection that represents the population of its neighborhood (or if it doesn't, you haven't shown us it doesn't...you don't even include the second largest racial group in Brookline in your graphs), instead of real issues of income inequality and racism that exist in our society.

Edit: I see elsewhere in this thread that you include Asian in BIPOC (not sure why you assumed we would know this).

"There are a ton of posts on here about parking so def check those out. But overall, parking here is a pain in the ass. Brookline doesn’t allow overnight parking. One option is getting a pass from the town to park in one of their lots and then you have to move your car to the street by like 7/8 am I think? I’m not sure of the rates but it’s fairly affordable. 

The easiest bet if your apartment doesn’t offer parking is wait for a spot to open up, or find a spot on Craigslist to rent out (stay away from any lot owned by Hamilton Company— they falsely towed me and refused to refund it & they charged me for two months of parking after I left their lot). 

Expect to pay minimum $150-$175 per month. 

The good news is most of Brookline is super accessible to walk and to the green line which will take you to just about anywhere you want.

"Like the other commenter said Hamilton company is good to avoid. 

I’ve always used a realtor to find a place, usually you have to pay one months rent but I’ve found it hard finding landlords who will rent without a realtor involved in Brookline. Dm me if you want recommendations for a couple good ones.

"1.) if you can, stay far away from Hamilton Company! Sadly they’re the biggest in the area so it’s difficult to not live in an apartment owned by them, but they’re a horrible company and super greedy— they have falsely towed me and refused to refund me and charged me for two months worth of parking at a location I didn’t sign up for. 
2.) apartments.com is a good place to start
3.) a lot of places will sign an 8 month lease (Jan-sept) right now. There are less places to choose from, but less competition. I would start looking now if you’re interested in signing a 8 month lease.

"Money is everyone's concern. Job responsibilities are what burn people out. It's why half of all teachers quit before 5 years, and burnout continues past that.

The 24/7 nature of availability can help teachers. I can rewrite lessons or do stuff on the fly without having to worry about carrying around a USB stick or even a computer. It's great, though there's still a discussion to be had about school systems using platforms like Google and so on.

The problem is that when new responsibilities are created, old ones don't go away. If a classroom is expected to use Google Classrooms - which updates and changes constantly, so it's not like you can really get great with it - you're still expected to have paper copies and so on. Kids are expected to have Chromebooks but if they don't then you're expected to somehow teach them.

If I have a lesson I need to upload online, then the district expects kids to be able to do it. That's why they make them take out Chromebooks. Only some families don't take them out. They're built like shit and they're financially responsible for it. So what can teachers do? Just fail the student? Somehow that falls on teachers to fix, which means our job just became more work *and* impossible. It's the equivalent of a kid who just doesn't bring a textbook or loses one and won't replace it, but with online stuff somehow it's treated like it's more possible so failure isn't an option.

Failure is *way* more common with electronics.

I'll go on if I don't stop myself but in the end, teachers can't be psychologists, social workers, daycare workers, and so on. The last thing any district will help new teachers with is planning lessons. Even the other day there was some vote about the state telling teachers to teach a lesson on something. I can't remember. Maybe on Indigenous people. Everyone praised it but everyone was against my idea that the state should make the materials and pass them out. Suddenly they didn't trust the state but they wanted teachers to have ""freedom"". AKA the obligation to do more work that'll either be acceptable or be scored against you.

Teaching is being gutted from every angle but the state likes that. They like people cycling in an out more than keeping teachers around. So I don't know what'll happen.",t2_htiik,pillbinge,0,1636225458.0,0,t1_hjl0wp5,hjl0wp5,False,anurodhp,t3_qo2ak5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brookline/comments/qo2ak5/teachers_protesting_at_coolidge_right_now/,Teachers protesting at Coolidge right now,/r/Brookline/comments/qo2ak5/teachers_protesting_at_coolidge_right_now/hjl0wp5/,2,r/Brookline,0,2

"Back to in-person classes from remote classes has been stressful for a lot of students. I understand that a trend of increased negative behavior in one school doesn’t mean there will be similar behavior in another. On the off chance, that there is however, I posted this thread. To gain more information and discuss. Though they are two separate schools, they share the theme of reopening after a mentally stressful pandemic. Nearly all schools in around the world do. It’s naive to think the past year hasn’t had some effect on our students. Again, there may be nothing here and that is completely fine (and ideal) as well. Please keep the reactionary language to a minimum and I’m truly sorry if my postings offended you.

"*Mods please remove if this isn't allowed* 

In the evening on Feb. 10th  of 2019 my brother (spoiler alert: who is fine and well today) was riding his bike when he got ran over by a truck. It Broke his pelvis and he was stuck in bed for over a month. These are the pictures of the truck that hit him. Back in 2019 I did get an possible ID on the truck type from another subreddit but not the company it was from. The previous post said it was probably a frozen goods (maybe even flowers) delivery truck that may make weekly rounds and to go back to the location of the collision at the same time. I do not live in Brookline (in fact I'm a couple hundred miles away) so i could not force my brother to do this and he never got around to it. Now he lives somewhere else and is doing a lot better. 

The reasons I am posting this is 1. For my brother because he doesn't do reddit. Ans 2. Because now he is offering a reward to find the culprit. 
So if anyone knows of a person or a company that uses this kind of truck and tends to drive down these roads in Brookline (located at the top of each image)  before heading onto the highway at around *10pm* on Sundays then please contact the Brookline police department or post on this thread. I will take any kind of useful information you may have. If anyone needs it I can update with the police report number for easier reporting/verification and any other information I can give. 

* Please note as I said I do not leave anywhere near Brookline so I doubt the pictures are in the order. Forgive me.*

Edit: I double checked with my brother and realized I got the time wrong. When I was called about his condition it was closer to 3 am but he actually got hit at around 10 pm on the 10th of February. My apologies! He also said it was on the corner of Harvard and School st.

I went out of my way to find the paper and read it and you’re calling me a sheep? How? Seriously explain to me how reading an academic paper (that you sent me btw) to draw my own conclusions is a sheep? Did you even read it? 

At a minimum they reduce the spread of droplets when you’re near someone by almost 50% (just above 40% for cloth). In what way does that mean masks don’t work? 

The only way I can see the mask don’t work is if you’re in an unventilated room that has been filled with people for hours.  Then I agree a mask may do very little from preventing a person from breathing in the virus. 

However since ventilation seems very good in most Brookline establishments the only worry you have is if someone breaths near you in which case just like the paper you sent me shows even cloth masks are providing a benefit.

"There are two components: delivery and supply.

Everyone has to use Eversource for the delivery aspect - they handle wires, meters, etc to get electricity to customers.

For supply, you have a choice of where your electricity comes from. You could just use what Eversource gives you by default if you want, or you could shop around and tell Eversource which alternative supplier you want to use. Once it’s set up, it’s just one bill to pay through Eversource.

Brookline Green is one of those supply programs. The town negotiated competitive rates for more sustainable electricity. I signed up for 100% Brookline All Green (the most expensive option) a few years ago, and didn’t notice a significant change in my bill.

"For those who don’t want to read that garabage webpage.

The 10% figure is based on a particle dispersion tests in an unventilated room for 10 hours as compared to the no mask case. They note that if there is at least some ventilation (air change rate of 1.7 is the lowest they tested) then you can have dramatic long term decrease in particular concentrations in a room. 

I’ve noticed that most places in Brookline have purifiers in the stores and it’s ridiculously easy to hit 1.7 ach. 

So the long term average of the particular concentration in most places should be okay. So does that mean you shouldn’t wear a mask? 

Well what if we look at the data from a single breath? In the study I point you to both Figure 3 and table 2 to see the benefit from single breath and they are estimating about 47% filtration efficiency over not wearing a mask for the surgical mask. 

Next we look at the dispersion characteristics with and without a mask which I will point you to figure 4 and 5 and the snippet from the paper.

>	In fitting the manikin with a mask, both KN95 and surgical masks are successful in arresting nearly all forward momentum and exhaled jet. As noted across a literature this is the primary protective mechanism of a mask for direct exposure to aerosols as it serves to reduce and redirect the forward momentum of the exhaled breath

is the school OVERLY racist? i think Brookline tries and does pretty well when it comes to racial justice (I am white, my family (wife, two children) are black.

I've had one child (previous marriage - he was white) go through high school here. My two youngest are in grade school.

There are issues... like I find a lot of brookline residents don't live their values when it comes to racial issues -- this is more of a Massachusetts/North East ideal of espousing a love for diversity but not liking anyone with a different value system

Although overt racism is not generally seen and I'm sure would never be tolerated anywhere.

My older kid reported an instance of a brookline police officer clearly singling out a black passenger in a car otherwise full of white kids... There have been lawsuits between police/fire and the city on discrimination.

Pierce School (K-8) has had a black Principal and before her, another black principal.

Brookline was famous for bussing in minority students when that was a thing

If your child is older brookline has public preschool (BEEP)  in some of the public schools its hard to get into but is a very very well regarded program and you should apply as soon as you can.

[https://www.brookline.k12.ma.us/BEEP](https://www.brookline.k12.ma.us/BEEP)

BEEP is school for 2.9 and up. Its more like school in the school buildings so its not all day like day care is. You do have the option to get extended day after school is over if you need child care.

Ive looked at the cost of all of these things generally cost about 20-24k a year. BEEP is 10k but is half the day. If you got for the extended day its another 10k a year and comes to be the same price.

Should add though that BEEP has fin aid options if you need it

"Brookline gains a family-focused noodle bar and an ice cream shop with ‘Far Out’ flavors

Looking for new ice cream options to keep you cool this summer? Lucky for you, Brookline officials just greenlit Far Out Ice Cream, which is opening soon on Harvard Street.

Far Out previously operated a pop-up stand in Hull near Nantasket Beach, but the 419 Harvard St. shop – opening this summer – will be the business’ first brick and mortar location.

“We’re very happy to be part of the community, serving ice cream to the wonderful people of Brookline,” founder August Radbill told the Select Board this week.

Far Out’s fare is “a specific style of ice cream from New Zealand,” Radbill said, adding that he and his business partner have both spent time in the country.

“So you take vanilla ice cream – either dairy or non-dairy – and your favorite fruit, and you blend it together,” he explained. “It comes out creamy and delicious.”

The ice cream bases come in vanilla and chocolate, and fruit flavors include ""Kookaberry"" (mixed berry), as well as strawberry, mango, blueberry, banana and raspberry. 

Far Out will be open Sunday through Saturday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., with 12 seats inside and 16 outside.

Old favorite, new owners

Mandarin Gourmet has changed hands, but beyond the new ownership, customers likely won’t see many changes at 1020 West Roxbury Parkway, attorney Jennifer Allen told the Select Board.

After more than 26 years in business, the Chinese restaurant’s previous owner recently decided to sell.

“Since COVID, many small business owners have struggled, including the prior owner there,” Allen said, speaking on behalf of the new owners.

Aside from some renovations, the new owners aim to keep much of the restaurant the same, including the menu and hours of operation, according to Allen.

A new beer garden

After temporarily shutting down for renovations in April, Prairie Fire is back with big plans.

Located at 242 Harvard St., the restaurant received permission this week to open an outdoor dining section in the nearby Webster Street parking lot. The outdoor section will take up about half the parking lot and will feature a beer garden setup with tables and benches, as well as Adirondack chairs.

“We will treat this space as an extension of Prairie Fire, with the same level of technique and flavors expressed in our food, but focusing more on classic New England seafood tradition (i.e. lobster rolls, fried clams, oysters, shareable smoked fish boards, etc.),” read a description provided in the Select Board meeting packet.

Owner Dan Kerrigan said his vision for the space is community-focused, and that the restaurant has reached out to other Coolidge Corner area businesses about hosting potential pop-ups there.

“We want it to be an open space that people can gather in and anyone from the community can come in and see and access,” Kerrigan told the Select Board.

Connecticut noodle bar chain coming to town

In addition to Far Out Ice Cream, Harvard Street will also be getting a new noodle bar, where the menu has a little something for everyone, according to the owners.

Mecha Noodle Bar, which has five locations in Connecticut, will be breaking into the Massachusetts culinary scene with a new shop at 285 Harvard St., a former Peet’s Coffee.

Co-owners Richard Reyes and Tony Pham are “excited to have Brookline be their first foray into Massachusetts. It is a Southeast Asian comfort food concept, specializing in Japanese ramen and Vietnamese pho,” attorney Kristen Scanlon explained on their behalf.

Reyes added, “The story of Mecha Noodle Bar is really a story of friendship. Tony and I have been best friends since third grade.”

Reyes opened his first restaurant in 2011, and Pham followed suit in 2013. They later partnered and expanded Mecha around Connecticut.

“We were looking for a place where community roots run really deep,” Reyes said of the expansion into Massachusetts. “We felt like Brookline was a really great example of that, in terms of the density of its community, the population and the families that are there, and we think that it will be a great fit for Mecha Noodle Bar.”

The menu includes various pho and ramen selections, as well as items such as the pork belly bao and seasonal spicy chicken banh mi special. Mecha also boasts a robust beverage menu, with a variety of cocktails, sake, beer and spiked teas – included spiked Thai tea and spiked boba. The menu comes in under $20 per dish before add-ons.

Reyes described the business as family-driven.

“It’s one of those few restaurants where a five-year-old, a 12-year-old, mom and dad can all be happy with their dishes and their beverage selection,” he said.

Mecha will have seating for 61 and expects to open by the end of the year, pending construction, according to Scanlon.

She described the incoming restaurant as “Brookline’s next not-so-hidden gem.”",t2_9abp4,anurodhp,0,1624317165.0,0,t1_h2lc4j4,h2lc4j4,False,anurodhp,t3_o4vdyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brookline/comments/o4vdyc/brookline_gains_a_familyfocused_noodle_bar_and_an/,Brookline gains a family-focused noodle bar and an ice cream shop with ‘Far Out’ flavors,/r/Brookline/comments/o4vdyc/brookline_gains_a_familyfocused_noodle_bar_and_an/h2lc4j4/,5,r/Brookline,0,5

"I imagine it's called Far Out because

(1) their previous location was along Nantasket Beach in Hull (on a little peninsula and near the World's End park for context)

"I'm coming from SF and severely missing just a basic ass ""mission style"" burrito.  Haven't had anything close.  I've tried Chilacates, Anna's, Boca Grande, and even Chipotle (it's own category).  Amelia's is the best out of all of them, but it's barely holding a C- in my book :(.

I most recently tried Lone Star.  Menu items look good.  Salsa was bland AF.  I asked for some hot sauce, tapatilo or el yucateco and the waiter seemed to catch my drift.  She brought me 3 salsas, a green, a red, and an orange.  Orange is usually habanero, but it was also bland :(.  Red had some tapatilo in it.  I'm bringing my own tapatilo next time.

I don't think quality mexican has made it here yet.  Best I've had was at a farmers market in VT where they were pressing their own tortillas (always a good sign).

"The route via Allston has bike lanes for a majority of the way, but I can't say they're the best designed to make you actually feel protected from cars. 

If the confidence and safety from cars is your main goal, then definitely go the bike path route! 

I made a map of the bike path routes I mentioned. For the river path, you'll see that I loop through some small streets instead of taking St. Paul and Commonwealth. While the smaller streets don't have bike paths, they're much calmer and friendlier than taking those main streets.

"Lived in Brookline for 10 years, year round biker. It's a beautiful and safe area with great access to restaurants, diverse grocery stores, and things to do. Absolutely couldn't recommend it more.

Biking to Harvard doesn't take very long, but there are some things to note if you choose to take the path along the river: if you're riding on the Cambridge side, it's not a smooth ride (lots of upheave from tree roots) and often crowded with pedestrians. This can mean a pretty slow crawl during summer days. The Brookline side is smoothly paved and there's significantly less pedestrians, but you'll have to carry your bike across the pedestrian walkway by BU Central to get to it (it crosses Storrow). Bonus to biking on the Brookline side is that its got great views. (By BU's Boat House, the path becomes a wood bridge, with train tracks above.)

An alternative is to bike through Allston, which I usually preferred because it's faster than fighting with pedestrians and the bumpy ride. The bike path on Harvard Ave is actually pretty good and you'll cruise. It's the same route as the 66, which is a fine option to take outside of rush hour, which is when you will wish you were walking instead. Taking the t is the slowest option by far.

"Getting to Harvard sucks from Brookline
 
Looking at the mbta map you can see Boston has spokes leading out from the center of the city 

Getting from Boston to/from anywhere on the spokes is easy

There are no concentric wheels in the mbta though — that makes getting from Brookline to Harvard a task of getting to Boston then getting to Harvard — that is two sides of an equilateral triangle instead of taking the straight route — 1 hour

There are busses and Uber but the BU bridge is a bear during rush hours

If you can travel outside of rush hour you’ll be good — if not you will pull your hair out

"Harvard itself runs a bus from the med school to Harvard campus in Cambridge, I believe. I've heard it can be a huge pain, but it's another option for you. The train is a little annoying because you have to go into the city to the hub and then back out to Cambridge, but it's doable.

Some of the duties (overseeing elections) would be hurt by making the town clerk an elected position, because there would be no insulation from partisan politics. I'd rather have the select board appoint a candidate who they know is up for the job, rather than some neophyte who's good at campaigning. 

Also, most other towns have appointed town clerks for the reasons mentioned above.",t2_18cgvcej,Johnsmith226,0,1620220085.0,0,t1_gx0stxg,gx0stxg,False,Johnsmith226,t3_n54rx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brookline/comments/n54rx3/town_election_results_bernard_greene_miriam/,"TOWN ELECTION RESULTS: Bernard Greene, Miriam Aschkenasy win Select Board.

"it’s called an analogy. it’s a figurative comparison and not a literal comparison.

i’m the kind of person who has always lived my life with a bit of padding around me. it’s not because i’m fearful; it’s because i know that most other people don’t and i have to account for that in order not to get caught up in their bullshit. the pandemic has given me more confidence than ever that doing so has been the right play.

so, go ahead and “live your life”. you may have rationalized a change in your behavior, but there has been little change in the circumstances. meanwhile, i want to see a higher vaccination rate and a sustained drop in national cases — a quantifiable change in the circumstances — before we “get back to normal”. that means keeping the low-cost, easy-to-follow restrictions that we are used to in place until further notice just to be on the safe side.
