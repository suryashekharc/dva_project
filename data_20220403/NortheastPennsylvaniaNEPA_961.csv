"I hate to burst your bubble, but Dems may keep the House.

Nate Silver's Fiverthirtyeight says new Congressional maps will give Dems a net increase of 11 seats...

[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-house-maps-republican-bias-will-plummet-in-2022-because-of-gerrymandering/)

Over in the Senate, the Dems will likely see their margin increase. Mark Kelly, John Fetterman win in AZ and PA, and the 2 GA seats will stay Blue. In PA, Shapiro wins the Governors race.

Again Silver agrees.

"My immediate impression when reading the post was that it was someone lacking practical sense. Reddit isn't the Yellow Pages. Yet, that seems to be all OP was looking for and that's all the first two commenters provided. In more technical forums, it's considered selfish for someone to ask a question with no useful context especially when that question can be answered by google search.

It disadvantages those who take time out of their day to answer the question and also disadvantages those who ask the question in the future. I agree: this is not an invalid optimization problem and OP is not the first person to encounter it.

I assisted with the issue while being bemused by the premise. I enjoyed the challenge of figuring out the context. As I got a more concrete idea of the problem actually being solved, I provided what was likely the best solution: connecting through ORD. Notice that after flaming me, OP disappeared. Is that someone who wants to help build resources for locals, or someone who was being selfish and silly? I'd love to hear why OP can't transfer through ORD.

"There are a lot of pot holes here, true. 

It's weird that you mentioned ticks. Do you think that ticks get to the PA border and say ""Oops, don't want to set foot outside of PA. We are Pennsylvania ticks. We stay in-state.""

There are ticks EVERYWHERE. If he moves to the Southwest to stay away from ticks, guess what? Fire ants and scorpions and black widow spiders and rattlesnakes. If he goes to the coasts to stay away from the snakes and scorpions, there will be sharks and jellyfish. And some of those other states have potholes too. Illinois doesn't have a ton of potholes, just $1.50 toll every 12 miles  and .75 every exit. Used to cost me about $8.00 in tolls every day to get to and from work, and it was a 2 hour commute for the delightful privilege due to the endless construction at all the toll plazas. But hey - no potholes OR roadkill!

"Congrats on running for office!

I tried to get on the ballot this year. While I am trying to take responsibility for my oversight, I got false information (more than once) from the Wayne County Democratic office and because of that I was not able to get my signatures in in time. I am very bitter about it, and I have had issues with the Wayne Co. Democrats to the point where I almost wonder if they are staffed by Republicans deliberately keeping Democrats off the ballot (most Republicans run unopposed here). I'm angry. But I AM using this as a lesson to rely on myself because I KNEW the Wayne County Democrats were useless and I never should have reached out to them anyway, I did so as a courtesy and I got burned hard.

"1.  Plenty of land that is NOT in an HOA. Definitely do not buy in an HOA or any other kind of planned development. Look around for ""for sale by owner"" or just bare land. 

2.  the land you buy won't be in an HOA, because that would be stupid. I worked in that industry for almost a decade, and I am telling you that buying in an HOA only makes sense if you want an investment property (and even then I still personally would not do it. They are lawsuit magnets.) If you buy land in an HOA, no, you cannot camp. You will be bound by bylaws and rules and regulations that protect the liability of the association. Your rights as an individual owner  don't matter. I could go ON AND ON. Don't make this mistake. 

3.  Septic is tricky. You'll need to have a rep from the Twp come out to evaluate and do a perc test. Chances are you'll need a raised sand mound system, they really don't do septics in NEPA anymore. Waste removal systems can run you between $15,000 - $25,000 depending on what you get (those prices are from 6 years ago when we were looking). We had to have a soil scientist come to our property and evaluate. The person from the Township almost didn't pass us because thy disagreed with the soil scientist, and the scientist explained (to me) that the Twp. guy didn't know what he was doing and explained why, and it was upsetting because it was clear the scientist was right. In the end we got our permit though. 

I looked for land for a year, maybe more, before finding the property we moved to. So keep looking. We paid just under $10,000 an acre for bare land and that was over 6 years ago.

"What part of NE PA is ""mostly HOA""? the vast majority of NEPA isn't HOA land. Only a few of the major developments are, if you are buying vacant land it almost certainly isn't in an HOA.

the HOA will almost certainly not allow something like this.. but you'd have to be a dumbass to buy in one anyway if you are getting vacant land

&#x200B;

that said - if you buy vacant land with cash that isn't in HOA or small municipality you can camp on it as long at its not your permanent residence. ie: in most areas you can't put a camper on your property and live in it full time.

Other options:

\- Unlimited budget, time constrained, and larger group? Fly private directly to your actual destination from Avoca

One thing to note is that my connection now is gig up AND down, so if you work from home and are constantly transferring files or have Zoom meetings, etc, this is awesome.

"Okay! It will be a 3 card reading, past, present and future. Regarding the present card it can be slightly in the past, right now, or slightly in the future. I will try to do a general reading with no specific question and give you what I find!  


Past: Something law related and its in a negative sense. Legal troubles, bias against you, something that seems rather excessive in its severity, probably related to legal related thing, or something that got close to being a legal issue.   


Present: Things are rarely consistent. I'm getting a lot of chaos in your life. Something that has happened, is happening or will happen will be drenched with trickery by someones making. I see fraud, could be related to finances but I feel its more focused on relationship (romantic or otherwise). Basically someone is doing you dirty or you're doing someone dirty.  


Future: This one is a bit bittersweet, and also a little more oddly specific. I'm getting that a younger man who you are/will be connected to in some manner (hinting at business wise, so perhaps someone you work with or will work with) will reveal they are interested in you, and it will cause some issues depending on how its handled.

"Yes.

But as someone who ran a successful, licensed, and certified pet sitting business for over a decade, I would not trust the key to my home and my furry family members to someone who just posted ""Need a pet sitter?"" and left it at that. 

When you ask someone to trust you with the lives of their pets, my suggestion would be to develop your marketing, express what you plan to deliver, the areas you serve, your rates, what that includes, and how you plan to delight someone's pets and give them peace of mind while they are away.

"Alright, for starters I'll do a very general 3 card reading with no direct question being asked. Just a basic summary (that a single card can give) of 1) your past, 2) your present, and 3) your future. With that said, here's the reading;

Past: You've had some major luck in your past. I don't know you so I can't pretend to know what about, but perhaps in money, job success, born into something above poverty and you acknowledge so. It's mostly focused on money or career, but can be tied to other things touching them. Overall it seems you've had a decent hand at life atleast ""in the past"".

Present: That ""decent hand"" is or was or already has come into jeopardy. Or so you may perceive it as such. I'm getting more of a health related problem, personally, that may make you feel unlucky. It's something that is... I want to say passed down through genes. Now, the present card is a little tricky in that it can be a little in the past, right now, or a little in the future.

Future: Gonna get rough. Obstacles of all kinds are coming your way, I can't say for sure but it also feels like relationship related problems. Done to or by you. I'm getting seduction, attachment and deception. 

Final thoughts: I don't need to know if anything is accurate, I just appreciate you being willing for a reading. I hope my reading is wrong, anyway, sounds like things may start to get or have already begun to get rough compared to where you were.",t2_1401e4,Kavril91,0,1648352251.0,0,t1_i29vmtl,i29vmtl,False,Kavril91,t3_tpaf8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEPA/comments/tpaf8q/local_witch_looking_to_do_a_few_free_tarot/,Local Witch Looking To Do a Few Free Tarot Readings.,/r/NEPA/comments/tpaf8q/local_witch_looking_to_do_a_few_free_tarot/i29vmtl/,1,r/NEPA,0,1

"Well Let's correct your lies one at a time again.

1. Biden took office in 2021..  I stated it 4 times in my comments.  The various dates from 2017 to 2020 I posted are Items Biden Revoked in his Executive Order.  If you took the time to read it,  you wouldn't look silly right now...
2. The Decline in oil production in 2020 was from the Pandemic.  Remember that virus that locked down the world? Hmmm.   Called ""Supply and Demand""  Everyone was locked down...
3. Did you miss math from when growing up?  Using your ""figures""   YOU stated that  Biden 21,000 more barrels of oil in his first year... then stated he produced  Biden produced 58% more oil in  Biden's first year.  You might want to ask a kid in your neighborhood to help you with your math.  Because the Government experts only see an 8% increase.   I sent them your figures.  They might need to get a few Princeton professors together and check the government numbers against yours.
4. Copy and Pasted only Biden's Executive order.... Something you haven't read or comprehended.  Bro.
5. You got the part of Keystone Pipeline 99% correct.... But forgot on point.  The Keystone pipeline XL  that was canceled by Obama then Biden  would have delivered an additional 800,000 daily to America.....  Funny how Biden approves Nord 2 pipeline for Germany..... Yet cancels a pipeline here

You stated  people didn't know the first phase was built....  People also don't know why phase 4 was killed.   Do you?  Hint .... Warren Buffet.   Berkshire Hathaway.   BNSF railroad oil trains.   Google the time line and see for yourself.  Also, feel free to Google how many oil trains  derail, spill oil, or catch on fire.

One more thing..... Nord 2 pipeline supplying Germany with Russian natural gas was dead.   The Biden, Trump and Obama all disapproved of it.  Yet Warren Buffet $$$$ gets involed.... ""Presto""   Biden approves Nord 2.  Funny how that works... BNSF  railroad moves Canada's oil..  OK.  Keystone XL Bad ...     Nord 2 ok...,   The Yamal port Bad.

Crude Oil during Biden's first year is higher than crude oil produced during Trumps first year. By 21,000 barrels. 

And the first year of his administration the country produced more crude oil than Trump's last year 58% of the year.

"Well not in the short term no. Unless we significantly ramp up nuclear or there are several break throughs in battery technologies. 

“Renewables” are much more fickle than traditional power generation methods, when there is cloud cover solar doesn’t produce power, if the wind isn’t blowing wind turbines don’t produce power, tidal really Isn’t a tech that’s anywhere close to ready yet. So how do you handle this an a 100% renewable power grid? Well you get have incredibly large banks of batteries so that you can produce more energy during the day with vast solar arrays and then use it at night. However with current battery technology that would be an insanely expensive, impractical, and environmentally devastating proposition (go look up a lithium mine). So then how do you handle this? Well there’s hoping for a break through with fusion or bio energy but that’s not something you can plan for. The other option is to use traditional fission reactors, one of the greatest scientific achievements of mankind, and produce massive amounts of cheap sustainable energy. That’s scary however and we are shutting down these plants instead of making more.

Obviously there is a decent size of the population that are feeling unheard and the dog whistle trump sounded resonated with them. To fix a problem you go to the root.

Nationalism and fascism only grow when left unchecked. You can make the argument that outside players played a part but the embers were already lit in our country. They just stoked them a bit.

Not to mention if you’re in pain at work or having a bad day, 8 hours of physical labor is more manageable than 10 hours. 
Also we’ve been getting offered voluntary time off a lot recently, which is nice if you need a break. But then we’ll be super busy because a lot of people went home. Why pay two people when you can pay one person to do two jobs? 
Not to mention, depending on where you work, you’ll be lifting heavy stuff all day. No matter how strong & fit you are, lifting 50 pound bags of dog food (which don’t fit in the box) and 40 pound boxes of cat litter for 40 hours a week is gonna take a toll on you.

"I see people mentioning UFO incidents and I have a family story that's been passed down about one of them, not sure which one it's about, though. 

My grandfather was a general and commanded a local field artillery regiment in the 60s and 70s. The story I have is that someone high up in the federal government called him in the middle of the night asking if he could coordinate the delivery of two massive industrial size cranes to a pond somewhere close to NEPA.

The story I got was that something crashed into that pond and they didn't know what it was but it was of the utmost importance that they get it out. My grandfather was a skeptical by the book soldier so his view was that it was some sort of Russian satellite or experimental craft.

He coordinated the crane delivery and got another call later looking for more powerful cranes as the original two broke trying to get whatever it was out of the pond. He couldn't believe they couldn't get it out with two cranes as the ones he sent were the most powerful ones available in the area since that's what the original call asked for.

Not a huge one but my late grams dad (great grandfather) went missing in I think the 60s with suspicious circumstances. It was in the Lily Lake area. He owed money to a bar or something and after he went missing there was a odd fresh pour of  concrete in the basement of said bar. A few years before she passed away (2019) she paid a sonar company (or something of the like) to see if her father was buried beneath that block of concrete.

"**[Sheppton Mine disaster and rescue](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheppton_Mine_disaster_and_rescue)** 
 
 >The Sheppton Mine disaster and rescue in Sheppton, Pennsylvania, United States, was one of the first rescues of trapped miners accomplished by raising them through holes bored through solid rock, an event that gripped the world's attention during August 1963. The roof of the Sheppton anthracite coal mine collapsed on August 13 and three miners were trapped 300 feet below ground. A small borehole was drilled from the surface in an attempt to contact the miners. After several days a borehole successfully reached a mine, and revealed that two of the miners, Henry Throne and David Fellin, had survived in a small, narrow chamber.

I know of an incident that occurred on March 5, 1965, at Benton Air Force Station, Red Rock, Pennsylvania. Benton was part of the Air Defense Command Interior Radar Defense Zone. Two radar technicians (one being my brother) were repairing the height finder radar antenna located northeast of the 648th Radar Squadron site. An ""object"" described by my brother as being a small saucer shaped object landed nearby. The two technicians decided to investigate. As they approached the saucer, a beam of light came out and struck both technicians. That was the last they could remember, and they failed to report to their command post. Air Policeman went to search for the two technicians, but they could not be found. All their tools and equipment were located near the antenna they were fixing. The Pennsylvania State Police were alerted and a search of the area began. Sixteen hours later, a state trooper found the two technicians walking on Route 487 about 10 miles from the site south of Lopez. The two technicians seemed dazed and were transported to a hospital in Williamsport.",t2_cfgu82r5,Legitimate-Aside-543,0,1643582455.0,0,t1_huwx2n8,huwx2n8,False,theeloglady,t3_sgi2j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEPA/comments/sgi2j6/what_are_some_good_nepa_mysteries_either_solved/,What are some good NEPA mysteries (either solved or unsolved)?,/r/NEPA/comments/sgi2j6/what_are_some_good_nepa_mysteries_either_solved/huwx2n8/,14,r/NEPA,0,14

"In this job market, you're better off.   

If you're going to school, its not the worst idea. Night shift, especially, no one's around so you're kinda free for studying and homework.   

I literally watched DVDs and streamed movies most of the night. Which wasn't terrible on its own, but there's only so long you can accomplish nothing in a professional setting before you need a purpose.   

Apparently the guy I replaced used to bring in a TV and PlayStation, would game all night. Only reason I replaced him was because he got caught sleeping.   

He didn't get fired. They just moved him to another site. So it's very difficult to lose your job, and that was long before any kind of employee shortage.

"Worked for them a decade ago, in NJ.  

Pay was low, and based on contract with location. So whether you worked that site for 15 minutes or 15 years, you made the same rate. No shift differential. Site supervisor made a buck extra.   

Job was miserable. Did nothing. Had no real function. Literally existed as an insurance coupon for the site. Did a few tours throughout shift, otherwise sat in a box trying to stay awake.   

Couldn't leave until next shift arrived. Power and heat out? Still stuck there.   

Uniform was made of garbage. Uncomfortable, unflattering, and falls apart. Once had to staple the crotch of my trousers closed, in the middle of my shift, after the whole seam just let go.   

Position had zero authority or capability. Unarmed. Not allowed anything, including taser or pepper spray. Only powers were:   
1) write down happenings in report.   
2) call supervisor.     
3) call 911.   
It was stressed that even saying, ""Stop right there!"" counted as illegal detainment.

"Ok like you have probably seen already in these responses the entire region of NEPA is in a huge battle to repurpose itself post coal and post industry. Hazleton is smack in the middle of the Anthracite coal fields of PA and is one of the harder hit areas economically. Scranton is probably doing the best, Wilkes-Barre is next but all are fighting a steady state of decline economically. The people are seriously some of the hardest working people you'll ever meet, blue collar to the bone and their identity is based on their labor so it's not surprising there's a sense of learned helplessness and overall malaise in an era of post industry. The people are straight shooters and are at a level 14 of 10 in terms of sarcasm. People are tough, like way past insensitive in a lot of respects. Drinking and drinking a lot is the major past time. I warn you now because it wasn't until I moved out West that I met college kids that didn't drink every night, or who would forgo drinking to do something better like skiing or hiking the next day without a hangover.

NEPA really is a beautiful area geographically, the people however might suck the life out of you if you don't find a good group to be around. Beautiful hiking, fishing, cliff diving, hunting, tons of old mines and abandoned buildings to explore, mountain biking etc. There's a lot to do if you like being outdoors. I grew up in WB and can tell you there's an overall attitude of there's nothing to do let's drink and it could drive you nuts. So if you hear that from people there tell them they suck and do one of the various activities I listed above.

If you want a rural setting mountain top, nuangola, Berwick and Bloomsburg are nice. Bloomsburg is a true small college town. Berwick is another tiny small town that's really nice. Wilkes-Barre is about the same travel time as these areas to Hazleton. In each case you'll be commuting on I-81 or I-80 which are continuously under construction when it's not snowing so be aware of that because your commute might suck in the summer when they are doing road work, when there's an accident or during snow in the winter. 

You might be better off getting a short term lease 3-6 months in Hazleton or drums (if you can find one) to start so you can get your bearings and then explore the areas to see what's most palatable in terms of a commute and living area. The beauty of the East Coast are the towns are so close. You can visit all of these areas in one day drive easily. You're on also in what I consider the geometric center of the major metropolitan areas in the eastern seaboard. Baltimore, Philly, Pittsburgh, NYC and Boston are within driving range. It'll be exciting. Anyone that was a lot of rambling but good luck and enjoy the adventure!

"This is a solid summary of the area. I would add that Kingston/Forty Fort are definitely nicer than the city itself, and you can still be downtown or at the main shopping area by the mall fairly quickly from both.

"I can give you my impressions of WB as an outsider.  Im originally from NYC but have lived in NEPA for the past 10 years.  I've spent quite a bit of time in Scranton and the surrounding areas. I love near Milford, PA.

 Love Scranton.... Really not a huge fan of WB.  It's got loads of potential and history.  I've spent hours walking around the place when my kids were competing in district swim. It's just not the safest place.  For instance, you know those areas you've been where the cops always have to go to the McDonald's to remove ppl... Or places where you have ppl coming up to you asking for money at the local gas stations.... Or cars regularly racing each other down a highway. That's WB.  That's also very unusual for NEPA.  NEPA is generally a very safe scenic part of Pennsylvania.  Mostly rural, forest, mountains and farmland.

WB is not NYC dangerous (not by a long shot), but it's just uncomfortable compared to nearby communities.

"If you are outdoorsy type, NEPA is for you. Huge tracts of land to explore with trails. Hazleton was strip mined in the last century and there has been a ton of reclamation. West of there in White Haven (i grew up there) there is a state park and river trail thats beautiful all year, especially in fall. Just wear blaze orange during hunting season and enjoy the forest.  

One of the issues with Hazleton/Wilkes Barre is access. There are 4 major interstates (80,81,84 and 276 or NE Turnpike) i am talking about air travel. WB has an airport but it is only a connector to Newark, Philly, Pittsburgh and a few others, very few if any direct flights. Hazleton does not have a commercial air port any more. Its there, just GA. You will need to travel to Harrisburg, philly or Allentown to get point to point flights such as to Portland. Even then only Philly has direct flights.

"Op, I’ve read the comments and I have some input.

I moved here from Alabama and I grew up in KY. I believe that I have a better view of the weather. Also comparing to all the other places I have lived.   Birmingham and Huntsville AL, Lexington, KY

First believe it or not, Huntsville AL is booming lots of stuff like fine dining and entertainment. Whatever Huntsville didn’t have I went to Nashville TN or Birmingham for.

After moving here I noticed that food and culture is a bit bland but I have my job which pays ok, and I have my family. What else do I need? I absolutely love PA for the hills and hiking(obviously not as dramatic as western mountains).  As far as the dull culture, just go to NYC or Philly every now and again and it satisfies me. As far as the people everyone I have met is awesome. Obviously not everyone is awesome but again it’s all about the type of people you associate with, true of anywhere.

I live in a rural area but I have a short commute to work.  

If you have this awesome job in Hazleton then I wouldn’t hesitate to take it. I would hesitate to buy in Hazleton without really checking things out. I work with a few folks who live in Hazleton and they haven’t moved out of the area and they certainly can afford to, so there are some good neighborhoods there.  It’s all about what you want, small town, big town, suburbs… 

I moved here and rented a while before I figured out where to live. 

Weather. It will get cold. There will be snow. Some bigger cities and more populated areas have more trouble removing snow because of the congestion. My po dunk mountain road gets cleared fast because it’s a small township. Keep that in mind. 

Summers are beautiful and not too hot with the exception of a few days. Once that is over fall becomes chilly fast before a real winter. On average the snow isn’t that much but enough to enjoy and cause some small inconveniences.

Feel free to ask me anything you want. I know more about the Bloomsburg and Berwick PA.

Hazelton is a mess but Wilkes-Barre has some nice areas. There's also plenty of small towns and rural areas you can live.

Multiple movie theaters, multiple drive in theaters, lots of restaurants, a casino, plenty of shopping, an aquarium, minor league baseball, minor league hockey, multiple concert venues, etc etc etc. 

There's also lots of stuff for weekend day trips. Two big things are NYC and Philly are both within driving distance. Though if you go to NYC you're better off going to Hoboken in NJ and taking the PATH train in. Driving into the city is awful. There's also a bunch of Amusement Parks Hershey Park, Dorney Park, Knoebels, Dutch Wonderland, and for the kids Sesame Place. There's also Nickelodeon Universe in NJ.

"I’m born and raised in Wilkes-Barre but currently a Junior at University of Pittsburgh. 

Being my hometown, I do deeply love the city of Wilkes-Barre and look back fondly on my years spent in the area but have really grown to love Pittsburgh as my new home. I still spend my vacations and summers in NEPA but I’m silently wishing I was back on campus the entire time

I really do think Pennsylvania is widely underrated as a state, there’s a lot of polish influence, so be prepared for pierogis, haluski, and kielbasa, and if you’re living in the NEPA area, trips to knoebels grove.

NEPA offers a few attractions, you could watch a minor league baseball game in Moosic, a minor league hockey game in Wilkes-Barre (at the Mohegan sun arena, which features many other touring acts as well) and the Mohegan sun casino, which, while admittedly small and unimpressive is still a nice spot to spend an evening. There are football fans a-plenty, Eagles probably have a majority of the region (go birds!) but you’ll have your mix of Steelers, Giants, Jets, Patriots, and yes, even cowboys fans.

"Drums and Mountain Top are both comfortable, more rural development-style communities which are easily commutable to Hazleton. 

Wilkes-barre is city-lite and has a thriving shopping district, Wilkes-Barre Township, but the bulk of the residential areas are run down. The ""revitalized"" downtown is lackluster, and many downtown businesses are struggling since the onset of the pandemic.

"I live in Wilkes-Barre.

It's a rough around the edges rust belt city. Used to be known for coal mining but isnt anywhere near as bad as West Virginia with a much more diversified economy. A lot of blight and not many white collar jobs though. Crime has gone drastically down over the years. Most people who tell you it's dangerous left the city years ago or live the suburbs.

Rent is pretty affordable, I pay 600 for a downtown studio. Buying a house is usually pretty reasonable too.


The main industries are healthcare and warehousing, with dozens of warehouses all over the county, and a large Geisinger Medical Center. There is a large Hispanic community in both Hazelton and Wilkes-Barre, mostly from the Dominican Republic and Mexico.

There's also two small liberal arts schools downtown around the historic district. A few insurance/telecom companies and small marketing firms too have offices.

Water quality is very good. A filter if you want a better taste still does the trick.

Overall it's not a lively and bustling city. It's pretty quiet, but there's still a lot of good restaurants and good carribbean food. Scranton is also not far for a bit more nightlife.

Kingston/Fort Forty are on the western side of the city and are a bit wealthier but still working class, but with a few hipster bars and dog treat shops and stuff. It's not blighted like much of Wilkes-Barre is.

Hiking is great in the area, its near Ricketts Glen, Tobyhanna, and 7 Tubs as far as state parks go.

Out of the 3 areas Hazelton is the worst. A mix of racist rednecks and working class immigrants.

The weather is cold and snowy in the winter, and pretty rainy, hot, and humid in the summer. The weather can be erratic in the Spring and Fall but overall pretty standard 4 seasons.",t2_9b9wf79,spicynuggies,0,1643039449.0,0,t1_hu14ion,hu14ion,True,LooseleafT_929,t3_sboudo,https://www.reddit.com/r/NEPA/comments/sboudo/thinking_of_moving_to_pennsylvania_from_oregon/,Thinking of moving to Pennsylvania from Oregon,/r/NEPA/comments/sboudo/thinking_of_moving_to_pennsylvania_from_oregon/hu14ion/,48,r/NEPA,0,48

Here are some free tips:

Do you have a resume? 
If yes who did you pay to create it and edit for you? 
What were their credentials? 
Did you get a second opinion? A third?
Did you include a proof read cover sheet describing why you are the perfect fit for that job?
Even if they say its not required, submit resume and cover sheet anyway. Call them , drive there with paper copies, hand deliver them. Takes 20 minutes. Can you spare that?
What skills have you developed to market yourself? 
What do you do in your free time to improve yourself compared to others that are also applying ?
When you fill out applications who proof reads them before you submit? What are their credentials?
How were your grades in school? 
What level of education did you strive to attain? 
What degree do you have, was it aligned to job needs?

If they don't answer leave a message ( exactly what i wrote above )  and try calling again later , its best when you get to talk to the HR person because they will look at your file and possibly give you further instructions
