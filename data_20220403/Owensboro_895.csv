"Best bars in Owensboro (in my 30 year old opinion):

Pub on 2nd - great beer selection, large list of fairly priced bourbon, creative cocktails, good atmosphere and clean

Brew Bridge - great local brewed beer, inside portion is ehhhhh… but the patio/outside is great (weather permitting)

Sip - a laid back wine bar with a fair amount of beer and bourbon, great for a low key date night

Brashers - the only place for live music, but can get a little “local” after midnight

Legends - best sports bar with good prices on food and beer, lots of TVs

Goodwood - not open yet, but coming this summer, Louisville brewer and distillery, I have high hopes for this

Par 3 - indoor golf similator if that’s your thing, cheapest beer in town and bring your own food

Rest In Peace Milewide. The beer was so good but they opened right as COVID hit and couldn’t make it

Bonus: best margarita and tacos in town at Ernesto’s!",t2_fn5dn,DinoNation24,0,1648844034.0,0,t1_i30z99v,i30z99v,True,Major_Audience,t3_ttrum5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Owensboro/comments/ttrum5/best_bar_in_owensboro/,Best Bar in Owensboro?,/r/Owensboro/comments/ttrum5/best_bar_in_owensboro/i30z99v/,5,r/Owensboro,0,5

"Until I recently started my own hvac company, my job as an oem rep had me traveling all across the state of Ky. As I am extremely left leaning in my politics and my little bit of the holler is fairly leftist as well, I try to make it a point to talk to people at gas stations and restaurants and whatnot as much as possible to see what they actually think - not what they identify as. 

Now I understand that I have a limited sample size and this isn't any kind of study, but it's generally been my opinion that Kentuckians are broadly in favor of some kind of gun control (usually limits to the number of guns that people can own,) generally in favor of some kind of path to legal status or citizenship for illegal immigrants, more often than not think that rich people have too much money and almost without exclusion think that the minimum wage is way too low and should be pegged to the rate of inflation. It isn't infrequently felt that some of the excess stuff that the wealthy have should be redistributed. I'm also pleased to report that most Kentuckians are aghast at the pollution that is around them and very aware that climate change is occurring. Most of those I have spoken to either think that climate change is manmade or at least exacerbated by human activity, while a small minority think that the climate is about the same as it has always been. Most Kentuckians think that there should be access to abortion in some sense or other - a common opinion that I hear is that it should be legal until somewhere around six months. Almost everyone wants better healthcare and legalized weed.

I could go on but I'm in a hurry. What I have gathered is that Kentuckians are totally ok with leftist concepts as long as they're explained without using trigger words. Where I have said ""redistribution"" in this thread, I have said something like ""should some of the excess stuff that rich people have that they could _never really use,_ such as dozens of cars or multiple yachts or whatnot, go to benefit people who don't have shit"" in real life. Where I could say 
""medicare for all"" here I would say irl something like ""should the government do something about the bullshit ass way that insurance companies operate?

"Well ramen is really good, but it's also regional... So sometimes it can be pretty different, I like some of it that comes out of Hokkaido. You understand that ramen is Japanese by the way, yes? Bubble tea is not that great... 

Also as far as things becoming Americanized, I get you wanting to try more authentic Chinese dishes but remember China is a really big place with lots of different cultural food elements and various regions, a lot of Chinese natives have not had a lot of Chinese food. Szechuan, Hunan, and Cantonese have traditionally been the primary regional styles to fuse with, Americanized as you say, influences. But you have to understand that one this doesn't change the cultural significance of Chinese American food as it is the traditional economic means and later food dishes of many Chinese immigrants and their descendants.

 Basically they were influenced by the new place and catered towards their new customers but consequently were changed by these new tastes as well. 

But things being Americanized does not necessarily mean it doesn't work the other way. An example would be sweet and sour lemon chicken. A lot of people thought that this was something they served in Hong Kong to tourist, consequently it's become harder to find but that's for other reasons, primarily generational preferences. In reality though it was a Chinese dish with American influences. It was a very popular soul food in Hong Kong for people in the 70s and 80s and often early 90s. It took on American influences from both the zesting of the lemon and other elements you're at the same time was actually made for a Chinese market.

"I want to believe it’s more than just that choice.  The American people have been lied to pretty directly by higher ups within our government regularly.  It’s reaching a point where most people just believe the opposite of what is said to them.  

It’s a “boy who cried” wolf situation.  Too many times elected officials have made outlandish claims which turned out to be false.  As a result, they could come out tomorrow and say, truthfully and earnestly, almost anything… and it would be met with doubt, skepticism, or flat out denial. 

What’s worse, is that the nuance of the situation is being lost behind the screaming masses on either side.  In the same way that a bad guy isn’t entirely bad, or a good person morally pure, the elected officials aren’t flatly in one category.  

The difference with the vaccine is now people are being told to Trust a science they don’t understand, while not believing the science that is being presented to them.  At the same time, being asked to trust that the State has their best interest at heart, when history has shown this to be far from the norm.

You don’t have to flip very far back in the history books to find the American people have been unwittingly used as human experiments.  You need to flip even fewer pages to find the last time they have been lied to directly.

And YOU are one of those screaming masses. Insisting your moral purity while insulting the human beings on the other side. It's more complicated than your giving the situation credit for.

"Well it's not only reactionary people... If it were only that our rate of vaccination would be higher. However it also poor people, but it's not just poor people, but also poor people of color. ***Why?*** It all comes down to trust. They don't trust their government, Democrat or Republican. They don't trust their sociopolitical structures and establishments; local health department, FDA, hospitals, so on. Trust has to be earned, and yes the unvaccinated include many people of color across much of the country have a long history of not trusting their sociopolitical structures and establishments, and with good reason. Failures to vaccinate now stem from the failures of 100 years ago, and far less time too. 
I don't think it's just a matter of convincing people to get vaccinated but rather convincing people to trust the institutions bitten them so many times.

"I am no longer living in the Owensboro area, but I have a lot family there still. My cousin/ her husband / their kids haven't gotten vaccinated. My read on it is that they didn't think COVID was a big deal to begin with (liberal media lies, etc.), and so why would they get a vaccine for something that's not a big deal? One of them is a nurse. Before the vaccine was available, I was absolutely seething about it because they get out all the time willy nilly, zero precautions, then go visit my \~85 y/o aunt, etc. Now I'm just ordinarily mad about it.

"This is my counter: 
1. the loop as described assumes the number of things first of all population growth this population growth is based on a projection by a state organization, which takes a lot of data from a census projection based on population trends. However both these studies fail to take into account more scientific approaches based on economic development, slowing birth rate globally, and macro level market sacrifice zones. So essentially both these studies projects growth that a lot of scientific data suggest will not happen. The reasons include what I said but essentially the developing market countries as they develops sees their population growth began to stagnate. Women marry later as do men, they pursue post-secondary education and careers. It's also noteworthy that within the developed market countries, such as the United States, there are sacrifice zones. Places where economic development does not take place, consequently development stagnates or consist of for archaic economic and urban development methods. So you have a developing world which is developing and a developed world which is stagnating because of its short-term goals. Essentially there won't be any people to use this thing, I mean there will be people, but the projections are way off. Yes it's true that in 2008 they were calling for 12 billion by the end of the century, now they're calling for 5 or 6, That's what the data suggest. So within the next 20 years population will begin to decline, the data that the government collects is primarily based on immigration and current trends, that that is important it just doesn't take more into account.

2. Development does not necessarily attract more development, and when it does it does not necessarily attract the development you want. Owensboro desperately needs more white collar jobs. Hollowing out is still a major problem here. However we also need to stop focusing on bringing in businesses and start work on developing businesses. Because local businesses don't move away. 

3. The proposed development of the loop suggest that Owensboro intends on suburban 20th century design going well into the 21st century. This is expensive, and is ultimately not sustainable in terms of tax. You can't afford to keep the roads up after 20 years, technically between 15 and 23 (climate, topography, geography, general use I'll play a factor). The reason for this is because the collected amount of taxes would have to be exorbitant in order to support suburban sprawl. It's popular because it enables developers to produce quick ready-made development. Governments accept this because they get quick tax revenue, essentially people move in quickly and suddenly you have more taxpayers. How after at the end of this period 15 to 23 years begin to see the desperate need for more development.... I know you're asking why do we need more of development? Because you need those quick new taxpayers, because your infrastructure is failing from the previous development and you can't afford to pay for it on tax alone because the people themselves cannot afford to pay that kind of tax. It's kind of like trying to mow a 150 acre pasture with a lawn mower... It's just too much to keep up. However then the government has to continue on, because it's either continue this development or fail... Or is it? Euclidean zoning, suburban or not, deals these problems. Euclidean zoning is essentially just single-family dwellings can't mix with small business areas. It also usually discourages the kind of buildings you see downtown, the old buildings, apartments on top, businesses on the bottom, offices scattered amongst. But there are alternatives, essentially get away from euclidean zoning which either creates or exacerbates urban development and suburban tax and efficiency which in turn effects the roads and livability of an area. It affects livability because your roads are not, walkable they're drivable.

"This assumes many things. First of all that a larger city is what they want. You do not get to decide for another people want for their existence. 

However let's dig deeper. Please read all of this, perhaps it will help you to understand, and I think that's very important

 Ultimately this is not about population, well it's true that they are showing some State evidence that we will continue to grow... Much of the academic evidence collected both in this country and abroad suggest population decline. Heres why; as developing world develops so does the number of children decrease, US population growth over the last 30 years has been nearly entirely due to immigration. Remember there are more baby boomers than there are Gen z and millennial put together. So the population projections for the county provided by the state are based on trends and not true science.

 I would encourage you to examine that data. Noteworthy that you'll likely stumble upon a Pew research study, 2008, says they'll be 12 billion more or less by 2050. I would encourage you to go and look and see if you can find any more current data suggesting that, it doesn't exist. That research was based on trends as well, you see lots of you in studies supporting population decline. Well it's true that population will continue to grow in the next couple years, population shift will happen. Remember humans don't live very long, and new generations are only about 20 years. Very quickly does a population affect its own self, one person replacing two can dwindle population very quickly. Most modern science backed estimates put us at 5 to 7 billion by 2050... 5 likely being closer by most research. Yes you're right that's fewer people than there are now. 

However let's go even deeper, step out of the international worldview, or rather let's zoom in. America post war, urban sprawl. The Eisenhower administration believe there to be a need for large highways, the reason the Cold war, civil defense. The Autobahn of Germany allowed Nazi troops to move quickly, Eisenhower hope to reconstruct this. Never mind that the country was considerably larger than Germany and thus as in Russia with Napoleon and china under Japanese occupation invasions must happen differently.  However it would appear that Eisenhower didn't really understand this, talk to any military tactician, big holes in Eisenhower's concept of invasion defense. After all that though, technology continued to advance troop movements, soon they would take considerably different methods all together. 

What this highway structure created by Eisenhower did was create sprawl, the compact walkable cities laid out very much as those in Europe though with architectural differences was the thing of the past. However with this new development came massive problems. These roads had to go places, where did they go? They went through communities, farmland, homes. They also created cities which you couldn't walk in, created cities that became car dependent.

 This car dependence meant that they had to become even larger, after all cars are considerably larger than people. This also created new infrastructure, rather a new type of infrastructure with also new challenges. Fact of the matter is roads last very well, for a very short time. In fact many roads did not require much of any maintenance for the first 10 to 15 years, roads in neighborhoods often 20. However after this time they require a great amount of maintenance or complete and total replacement. Replacement is expensive, patch and repair, that's cheaper. To replace every new road every 10 to 20 years is economic destruction for a community, yet at the same time constant repair is as well. 

The answer, not the good answer, but the answer that was given... Expand, keep expanding. As the community grows these new tax dollars are used to supplement the leaking barrel, essentially new tax dollars care for old infrastructure. However this is only sustainable as long as the New roads don't need to be repaired or replaced. So this is only sustainable for 10 to 20 years, and then you need more growth, inadequate levels to pay for the older infrastructure and the newer old infrastructure. And then you repeat over and over and over again. The fact of the matter is you can't continue to expand, one populations won't support it, to the farther you expand the more old infrastructure lies between, three Tennessee won't like it if you build Owensboro in downtown Nashville.

 But now it's delve into what I said was number two, the old infrastructure in between the new infrastructure. Eventually as expansion continues, there's too much space between the city center and the new better infrastructure, the new tax dollars won't support it everything in between. Now we get into sacrifice zones. And yes there are sacrifice sounds, there are in the very beginning, the people in the communities that the New roads cut through, the communities that grow into suburban sprawl losing their cultural identity forever, but also there is the slum. The slum becomes the area that the new tax dollars can't afford to keep up. Traditionally these areas were occupied by minorities and the poor, these individuals post list of a political reaction threat. They're voting numbers were not enough to significantly change power, their economic resources the same. And so the slums become the ghettos. And expansion continues, and infrastructure demands continue, and sacrifice zones continue. 

And I know what you're thinking, you're thinking ""well this doesn't have to be that way we can develop differently"". To this I respond  ""Not with the loop"". Here's why: this Loop is laid out in such a way, placed in such a place so as to assume growth, again growth I say to you science does not support, but to assume growth based on car centric sprawl and not compact walkable cities. If it assumed anything else it would not be placed where it is. It also probably wouldn't exist, because let's assume for a moment that they're right and that the population doesn't increase. If they were truly intending upon these new form of a development, but that I mean the old form of development that is a small compact walkable city. Why on Earth would they need the loop to change traffic, the traffic wouldn't exist, not enough to justify any segment of the loop. The fact of the matter is this is a projection of business as usual, developers make money by development, and only development. Pursuing short-term gains at the expense of the communities they develop. Politicians are either ignorant or pursuing their own short-term gains such a staying in power or the collection of election funds and future personal prospects. So the system goes unchallenged.

It's also drawing a hard line when something runs counter to human rights, because when one human has their rights violated we all do. If something looks strange you look into it, you don't take any of bureaucrats or any politicians word for anything. The stakes are too high to take their word for it you look and see.

"I can definitely see this happening for the sake of city expansion/future and preparing for businesses elsewhere in the county but this for sure is a long term project like the mayor mentioned. This won’t be done tomorrow and I think someone said this has been in the works for quite some time. 

Don’t get me wrong, I am all for expanding Owensboro and for the exploration of a project like this but I doubt this will be completed for sometime. If they complete parts of it in different segments over time that might be helpful overtime. If they plan or foresee Owensboro expanding then this will be a needed project so there isn’t anything wrong with exploring it presently. They probably have more data than I do and know more so I trust them. 

I’m also curious on the scale of this too. Are they planning to build an interstate or what exactly? Something small scale that can then grow in the future when needed would be nice to save money. Big trucks can use this without going into the city and I know more commercial opportunities will become available with something like this because ease of transportation.

"I would also have to agree 6,000 is not particularly much for a 20-year. It's also very likely that populations will go down over the next 20 years according to recent statistics we might drop as low as 6-5 billion worldwide by 2050. This is counter to the view, primarily pushed until recently that world population would increase to close to 12 billion by the end of the century. That are now suggests that this is not possible, and it likely will see a decrease in population. This stems from a variety of reasons primarily the development of the developing world and the decrease in children. China has recently begun trying to combat this increasing the number of allowed children by Han Chinese citizens to 3, with incentives to fulfill this, and there's talk of 5 as 3 will likely not be enough to sustain their workforce and make up for those who still choose not to have 3. I know what you're thinking this is the world not Owensboro, but Owensboro exist within the world both in terms of market effects and population trends. and yes it's true that in 2008 the Pew research center projected an 85% increase in population from 2005 to 2050... That's in the United States... however recent data suggest that this is completely inaccurate and failed to take into account a number of different trends. Population the United States is expected to fall, by some estimates rather steeply. 2 people creating 1 can drastically alter population very quickly, even within a decade. Add to that a number of individuals not reproducing, primarily due to poverty and/or long working hours.

it's also increasingly unlikely that as the world continues to digitize, that there will not be an influx of people to the Owensboro area. They will work from home. The population increase over the last 20 years has primarily been from people surrounding counties coming to Owensboro for jobs, not to mention an increase in immigrants. it's not worthy that the American population has increased over the last 40 years solely because of immigration. Without immigration the labor market would have dwindled to no longer stable. 

Ultimately Owensboro is still building itself as the 20th century post war City. This is not sustainable, it also contributes to economic disparity and lower quality of life.

The woman was mining information from birth records and the Social Security database, primarily selling them for the purpose of filing fraudulent tax returns. Changes were made and now only Social Security numbers of persons who have been deceased ten years or more are accessible on the site.

"Before I moved away a couple of years ago, a dog park was *this* close to being built. Are you telling me it never happened? Boo! If you scroll down to when this sub was created many years ago, I tried to get some like-minded folks interested in helping me get one going, but there wasn't a response. A few years prior to that, way back in 2008, I went around to several vets' offices and pet stores and posted fliers trying to garner some interest as well. I had high hopes of also trying to get it to work when I ran for city commissioner in 2016, but I lost. Boo again! It just never got off the ground. You ought to get some friends together and try again; attend a few city commissioner meetings, get a dialogue going. Although if that crooked board of commissioners can't make a buck off it, they wouldn't be interested. Honestly, I can't say that's the case now as I've lost track of who's on the board, but when I left in 2018 there were some real scummy land developers and real estate mogul shitheels sitting on the board.

"Mr Gibson playing the role as an aspiring Joel Olsteen. We've been actively on his social media getting him to release his church's financials (as a non-profit, they must be made to the public). We also got loud and started sharing pics of him hanging with and praising Roger Stone. Pretty certain that is what got his article in the local paper removed where he claimed to be receiving death threats.

As someone part of the group that spread this information and constantly questioned his motives, the only attack on him was his character. He's excommunicated parishioners for being trans, denied access to handicapped individuals because he didn't want to spend money on wheelchair accessibility, and preaches Trump before Christ.

"Restaurants: Owensboro is known for BBQ, and Moonlite is the common tourist spot, but Old Hickory is my favorite. The regional dish is burgoo and Old Hickory makes some of the best in town. My other recommendation is Wonder Whip on E 4th Street. Greasy burgers and fries done right. There are also a couple of international places - Owensboro Karen Restaurant and Thai Food Owensboro but I'm not particularly a fan of either one. Wasabi on 54 has half-priced sushi, it's ok but it's half-price in a rural land-locked area so what can you expect?

Coffee shops: The Creme downtown. Other than that it's just Starbucks.

Hiking: Yellow Creek Park has a nice 1-mile trail. Rudy Mines trails are longer but I tend to get lost there between all the bike and hiking trails. Audubon Park in Henderson has some really nice trails, as does Hoosier National Forest.

Breweries: None in town.

"I wouldn't, I think it's critically important that it come down in the legal way. Maybe more so in this county more than anywhere else.

"Well I'm not really sure, I'm not one. 

What I can tell you is that there is a black police chief, and a number of officers. He recently came out against the threat of violence directed against Owensboro protesters online.

 There is a Confederate statue on the county courthouse  also. Which never really made any sense as Kentucky was a Union state, and much of the county with Union it's allegiance. and the courthouse that stood before it was actually destroyed by Confederate rebel guerrillas... And it's kind of common knowledge as there's a big plaque about it.
Some of the poorest neighborhoods are black, some are White too. Personally I feel like it's still there because so many of the young college age people, really I guess what I'm saying is so many of the millennials move away... And the ones that don't usually financially struggle here. If you don't have a degree in medicine, it's very difficult to succeed. so basically they go out into the harder larger world, and do much better than they could do here. I should say that political movement steps are being made toward the statue, mostly by younger people 30 and under. There are two universities in the town; Wesleyan and Brescia, both are private religious colleges.

Oh the security guards at the hospital have a bad reputation, so I hear anyway... But if you're working there they won't dare bother you... I've actually heard it's only a couple of them, they used to be cops and still expect to use that same amount of power.

Completely corrupt! They are in league with city leaders in a racket using public funds to further their business interests. There is no doubt in my mind that they will be involved in a major investigation some day in which we will find that government employees were taking kickbacks from that company. Check out the deal that went down with the TIF area where the city bought land for the new schools for millions of dollars in an area that was publicly funded to be an economic center for the community. They could have bought that land years ago for pennies on the dollar to what they paid for it from Gulfstream. They shoveled public money into the area to raise the property values to obscene levels and then overpaid by many times.

"If you want to live in the nicest part of town, anything off 54 but it will probably be more expensive and that's where traffic is the worst in the city. Everything out that way is relativelt new development, including the hospital. Don't move to the west end, which is immediately west of the downtown area.
I live in the Apollo Heights area in a home. There are lots of cheap apartments and it's a safe area, but on the other end of town from the hospital. Probably a 15 minute drive. I can't speak to the quality of any apartments except Royal Arms, which is where my boyfriend lived before he bought this house. It's a decent complex with good management and in one of the safest areas of town but it's overpriced for Owensboro given the age and size of the apartment.
