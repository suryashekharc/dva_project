"Having a place to return to when the time is right does sound appealing! We're not in a financial position for that right now, though.

Oh man, I do not get the appeal of the river valley. Maybe I've been spoiled by BC beauty, but the 4 months of the year it's not too snowy/icy/muddy to go in, there are so many mosquitoes swarming in the valley you don't want to be there. If you stick it out you have views of... the brown river. And willows. And that's it. I guess it's better than nothing? Within my first few days here I was directed to Mill Creek as one of the gems of the city. It smelled so much like sewer I gagged (this is not a rare thing) and was just brown, brown, brown...

Have you heard they're going to be stopping development of any new mtb trails in the river valley and potentially blocking off existing ones? One of the few perks – single track within the city – is now going to be greatly diminished.

Yeah, Calgary crosses my mind as better for outdoor pursuits. But I'm getting older and I've really only got one more big move left in me: I want it to be to a place I know I love (the Island).

"That's so crazy!  I mean, I have a great career in Edmonton (hint: I work for a utility lol).  I actually did the same, I grew up in Northern BC and I thought, I could do Edmonton...  

I was lucky where I was permitted to work in Nanaimo remotely for the summer.  At the end of the summer, I made the decision to purchase a property.  I've been thinking about doing it for the past 5 years and kept sitting on it...  anyways, I've done it now, didn't really want to do the landlord thing but I wanted somewhat of a chance of getting back at some point.  I'm actually in Nanaimo right now but have to fly back on the weekend :(.  

On the flip side and more positive, I've just recently met someone who grew up in the greater Vancouver area, moved to Olds and so far is loving it.  They're close enough to the mountains, can actually afford a house, etc...  but that's why I recommend more the Calgary area if people move from the coast and are into the outdoors.  One of my friends joked and said ""but you have the river valley"" lol...  I said, that gets old FAST hahaha.  There's definitely some beauty to Edmonton, I have friends who are totally content with it, but it's not for me.  It has done me well though but I struggle with it.  And awkwardly, I have everything I want...  any tool I could imagine, quad, motorcycle, etc...  but I just struggle there.

"Rocky Mountain House actually is quite nice!  When I was more into ATVing, we usually went to that area.  I've actually been there quite a few times and I like it.  It's also that small town which can be good or bad.  I grew up in a town in BC just a bit larger than that, I didn't like that everyone knew each other's business and were nosy but I don't think it's that bad in Rocky (I can't say for sure) and maybe it doesn't matter.  But if you want an acreage, it is pretty appealing!  I've always really liked it there and again, you're close enough to the mountains and outdoors there.  

Sadly, I think most winter cities you're going to be stuck with bad roads.  Even Prince George is just awful haha.  Kelowna seems ok with snow but there's a lot of money in that city.

"Health Care Assistant Program? 

If that is what you mean, then my experience would be run the fuck away from it lol.

To be fair I took the program 10 years ago, and left that industry not long after, so my experience is somewhat dated. However I still communicate regularly with many care aides and they would agree with my assessment. 


One of the most degrading, underpaid, understaffed, disgusting, health risk jobs I have ever had. 

Would never do it again. 
Hours suck. Colleagues often suck. Hierarchy sucks. Changing huge adult diapers full of feces and urine for hours/day is backbreaking, disgusting, and thankless. 

My back has never recovered. Every single care aide I know or knew has back and/or shoulder injuries.

Physical assault was common on dementia wards as well, as well as many other hellish scenarios I will not describe here.  

Hated it. Course was both boring and grueling.

"I own a house in Nanaimo although I'm not currently living there as I'm living/working overseas for a bit and I rent out my house.

What I like... the city. It's small enough to be easy to get around in without stressing you out. The traffic isn't bad. You don't have to go far for most things. The schools (at least the one my kids go to when we're home) is really good. There are some awesome preschools as well. There are services to get things like Ikea furniture delivered to your door at a reasonable cost. It's not overcrowded... yet... and there's a bazillion parks and outdoorsy things to do.

What I don't like... Housing is expensive and there's next to nothing on the market for rental or sale... there are both, but in small numbers. BC Ferries is expensive. There's few other affordable options if you need to get off the island. Tourist season sucks. There are some noticeable missing services (Costco is often overwhelmed/packed). And OH MY GOD the medical system. There's ONE walk-in clinic in Nanaimo and it's just... so insufficient for the population. If there was one thing I would want to fix in Nanaimo... it'd be the medical clinics and family doctor situation. Dire isn't a strong enough word for it.

"I moved here about 10 years ago from the mainland. Things I like are the traffic is so much nicer, it's really close to the ocean so if you're into scuba diving or boating it's great. Close to some good hiking and mountain biking. Much safer than the mainland, regardless of what you hear about downtown or harewood: it's always people who have grown up here complaining about that stuff. Houses are cheaper, still not cheap but nowhere in Canada is anymore.   

Things I don't like is there is quite a bit of closeted racism and hatred towards homeless and drug users. You'll probably have to hear the phrase ""nobody wants to work anymore"" several times a day. People will be mad that you moved here from off island because they think they own the place.  

Oh, and healthcare is terrible here. There's only one walk in clinic and you won't find a gp, seems like all the doctors are shutting down and no one's opening.

"Interesting, lol, I feel my history shows as if I badly hate AB lol.  I've been there for about 12-13 years now.  I'm not sure what activities you like.  If you move to AB and like the outdoors, I recommend the Calgary area as you're closer to the mountains.  I moved to Edmonton and it just kills me.  It's very family friendly, lots of activities in the city to do (which are great), financially I'm way ahead however I miss the outdoors.  I feel I have to drive 3-4 hours minimum for anything I like so I just jump on a plane to Nanaimo instead.  If I went back though, I would choose Calgary for that reason.  And the Kananaskis area is beautiful!  I think many people are though as it seems to be picking back up there.  Anyways, you never asked my thoughts but I thought I'd share hahaha :).  If not having the outdoors super close to you isn't a big deal, Edmonton isn't a bad city.  Tired of the potholes but that's inevitable in most winter cities hahaha.

Night life is herded downtown while most people who can afford to go out live 20 km north of the nightclub district. If you have kids prepare for a $$$ nite out.

"VANCOUVER ISLAND  CAUTION:

In regards to all the people wanting to move here from Alberta and Ontario as well as many other heavily populated cities across the country, as well as those wanting to visit...

Before you come to Vancouver Island  to visit you must be aware of what is happening here.  Especially, around the mid island and all of south island! There's a housing shortage, rent has tripled, and folks are vacationing here in record numbers...

So if you plan on moving here, or just plan on vacationing on our beaches, river bottoms, or lakes this summer, I think you should know that wolf spiders, fire ants and bedbugs have infested hotels and motels across the area due to dryer than usual weather. The woods will eat you alive with ticks and chiggers. 

Our lakes are full of gators, fresh water sharks, and creepy old guys wearing speedos. 

Our rivers are full of drunks in tubes peeing themselves while the banjo players lay waiting in the bushes. 

Cougars have eaten many domesticated animals and possibly some small children.

The local bear and elk population are all 'in heat' and think your wife/girlfriend is hot.

Snakes... don’t even get me started on the water headed copper moccasins here, and the Diamond Back Rattler Cobras. 

The poison ivy has overtaken all other vegetation.

We have had bear sightings at every park and town they are after your picnic baskets….and some cougars have been spotted in motel rooms and bars.

Watch out for the jackalopes, they have been extremely aggressive this season. 

We have the sasquatch invading our parks and it’s their mating season. Porcupines are ""stabbing"" small children should they dare to utilize the local playground equipment. 

Skunks have made their way over and multiplied at unprecedented rates and wander the local campgrounds in packs looking for beer.

Murder hornets!?! We’ve got great black clouds of murder hornets, and swarms of giant crickets and even some American bullfrogs. 

Scorpions have been congregating in massive quantities under rocks, logs, wooden steps, automobiles, and tarantulas are now stealing peoples food and biting like crazy.

I’m pretty sure all private tiger owners (we had a jump in them after Tiger King) have released their cats into the streets of our cities and towns. 

Head lice now fly and we have vampire bats. 

Oh, and no one is vaccinated.

"I’m going through the contractor thing myself right now, and honestly, if you have the time and half a brain, you’re better off doing it in your own. Contractors make their money off sourcing material and workers, then charging 5-30% on top of each line item. Not too mention additional fees for managing each trade etc and project planning. Find an engineer for structural - get a referral for drawings - submit for application. Then find a plumber, and ask for reference for framer/carpenter, and electrician.

"The amount of plastic waste in everyday packaging is the problem but instead of tackle that problem they banned the one bit of plastic that was reused by most households.

Due to pandemic no one was or is letting you hand them a reusable cup yet one can still eat at a restaurant and the server take away your used plates and cups. 

On another note as regional governments try to reduce plastics by banning them in a rather spotty manner the feds have legalized cannabis with packaging requirements that pretty much eliminate any gains made in reducing plastic waste/use.

The only way I can see to ""grandfather"" you current front yard fence would be to slowly replace it in sections. You could maybe get away with it by saying you didn't replace the old fence but instead just ""fixed"" the existing 6' fence.   


Side note....I read a story about a family in victoria who had an ocean front house with an old pool built out into the tide line.

It’s completely outrageous that we can’t get health care! 

I’m not an expert but a lot of posts on r/Vancouver talking about low pay is per patient for GPs compared to specialists and even NPs (!) and the insane bureaucracy (relative to other provinces and definitely to US) being the cause. 

I wrote my MLA ( Malcolmson) in 2020 to ask why the other walk in clinics were shut “because of Covid” (which seems like a ruse since other drs offices were open) and why there was such a shortage in GPs—and she told me the solution was coming because there was going to be a new med school opening .
No clue how that’s going to fix our retention problem (even after 10 years or whatever it takes for the first to graduate from this new school). They’ll just graduate and move to ON AB, US, or become dermatologists.

"I experienced same thing out in errington in 2017. My woman felt vibrations then  the sound i heard sound and 10 months later felt the vibration. If you can in the dead of night when you can hear sound clearly record the sound with your phoneusing a spectrum analyzer. Learn how to filter the graph so you tecognize thesound on agraph and google the Mhz range you sus the sound to be. Wanna prove vibrations? Depending on strength i had black dinnerplates sprinkled with salt left on the floor and dont interfere with the vibes. So no laundry music kids running around and see if the salt formsor groupstwardsthe center of theplates. I also had necklaces suspended from the ceiling and watch them moveslightly or just dangle dead. Or in a weird experiment for myself i places my bobleheads collection arounnd the place and using spare older phonesi timlapse recorded them over a 1 hour period.. They all worked and the sound was narrowed down to abad bearing from agravel pit rock crusher 2km away but not the vibration. The vibes fell smack dap into a toronto news story where a cul de sac was experiencing similar phenomena. I figured out what was going on andpromptly dropped all experimenting. Lets just say that if you have need for alarge amount of power generators but you forgot to not only bolt them to the floor, but also to the wall , they will harmonically cause a sympathetic vibration that can be felt for quiet aways even if they are .....underground?.......ya..the sound was from who knows how many genies all running.together. thats my adventure in spectrum analysis vibes and sounds continuously running 24/7.

"IMO:

Quarterway is a vibe on Karaoke nights. More of a neighbourhood bar/pub; ie., more of a lowkey “grab a cold one with the crew” vibe rather than a “night on the town vibe.”

Old City was the pre-clubbing spot before Covid… but is now the end game clubbing spot. Basically, the same people you would’ve seen at Level 2. Lots of VIU students to be found here. Drunk, loud, and wild is the vibe.

Terminal is everything you want in a classic bar - cool building, pool table, darts, etc. but for some reason no one goes there… so it’s not a ‘bumpin’ place, but you are bound to meet cool people and have more interesting and meaningful connections.

Carlos is for birthdays, ponchos, and what used to be a really great appy hour special... It’s alright for a bite & drink and dip before going to where you actually wanna go. More social house vibes than bar vibes. Actually, pretty nice in the summer with the outdoor seating and ocean views. 

Milton St. Has after work drinks with colleagues vibes. Not much else to say.

"In my opinion the best bang for your buck education wise is Tech schools. BCIT, SAIT, NAIT etc. Lots of 1-3 year programs that actually lead to accreditation and a real career. Often their programs are based on industry demand and lead to a job that actually pays enough to live on. Most people would take student loans to support themselves while they study.

"A bit ironic that RCMP spokesperson O'Brien qualifies the crime as ""brazen"", when his colleague Josh Grafton, who had been deemed ""fit for duty"" by the RCMP in 2020 (after getting charged criminally 3 times), recently had a report published about him, declaring him definitely unfit for duty:

[https://www.crcc-ccetp.gc.ca/en/final-report-following-public-interest-investigation-arrest-b?=undefined&wbdisable=true](https://www.crcc-ccetp.gc.ca/en/final-report-following-public-interest-investigation-arrest-b?=undefined&wbdisable=true)

The RCMP knew that Grafton was unfit for duty, since 2015 at least.  Grafton is a repeat offender sociopath, on trial for 3 criminal charges against him, and 3 civil suits.

Is it not ""brazen"" for Nanaimo RCMP command to have lied about Grafton being fit for duty, for 2 years? - placing our community at risk in the process?

For more information about the Josh Grafton scandal, you can see my post from 2 years ago:

"I just know what the RCMP told me.  I saw a male in a black hood approach my vehicle twice.  When I came out there were multiple boys in black hoodies and wet spray paint on my van. I tried to talk to you and two immediately left (not a very strong sign of innocence), one was very rude and the other well mannered.  You're right I don't know you or what you're going through but you don't know me either. I care less that you're criminally charged but more that you're now on the police's radar and your parents are hopefully more aware of what you're up to or the people you're hanging out with.  Vandalizing people's property may seem like innocent fun but it does hurt people.",t2_fuojqdww,AdventureAwaits5,0,1647313833.0,0,t1_i0pddnj,i0pddnj,False,AdventureAwaits5,t3_tbg7pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanaimo/comments/tbg7pc/teenagers_tagging_my_fence_and_vehicles_today/,Teenagers tagging my fence and vehicles today.

"Maybe in an ideal world this works but in reality it doesn't. This comes across as soft and weak to them which makes you food. They aren't interested in a therapy session or a lecture, (even though that's exactly what they need) they want to rebel because they feel oppressed, usually from their home and/or school life.",t2_9cvxe,hotdogohyeah,0,1647304684.0,0,t1_i0otaiz,i0otaiz,False,AdventureAwaits5,t3_tbg7pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanaimo/comments/tbg7pc/teenagers_tagging_my_fence_and_vehicles_today/,Teenagers tagging my fence and vehicles today.
