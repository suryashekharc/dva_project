I am currently seeking participants for my research study looking at the effects of a caregiver training program for caregivers of  recovering Covid-19 survivors on caregiver burden. The aim of this study is to give caregiver's tools to reduce stress and burden.

The participant could even be an informal care giver such as a spouse or child.   
The study will run for 6 weeks, for 45 minutes once a week and will be held on Zoom. Please contact me if you or a loved one is interested in participating in this study.

  
Thank you in advanced!

Hannah Patterson

"I am a graduate of the Southern Lehigh SD, early 1970s. The district (Coopersburg and Center Valley zip codes) was in transition from a farming  to a suburban commuter (Mack, Steel, Western Electric) economy. It was conservative and was not very welcoming to outsiders. Good school district, dedicated teachers, bikes, front lawns, septic systems, etc. 

Today farming is gone, sewer system prevents septic issues, the “unnamed tributary to Saucon Creek” is clean, and Main Street in Coopersburg is charming. It is still a fundamentally conservative area, though the flavor of conservatism has been refined by a high level of education. The proof, as noted by an earlier post, is in the composition of the school board. My sense is that the area is as conservative as the townships north of the three cities. The difference is that the level of education of voters and property owners in Coopersburg is quite high. It’s a great place to Iive if you fit in.

"""Coopersburg"" can refer to Coopersburg borough, parts of Upper Saucon Township, parts of Lower Milford Township, and parts of Springfield township. Coopersburg borough is like a small town area and has older homes mostly on smaller lots. The Townships will have both suburban and rural settings depending on where exactly you are looking at. I think you need to see specifically where the houses are at. In the Townships you will find varying levels of walkability (some areas have no sidewalks and you will be walking in the street itself), varying levels of property upkeep, etc. depending on whether you are on a main road not in a large subdivision, within an older/newer/lower end/high end subdivision, etc. You will find everything from townhouses packed in like sardines to multi-million dollar mansions on acreage.

Not because you're right, but because you just made me realize I left my headlights on! They have an auto setting, but didn't automatically come on this morning because it was too bright. So I had to manually turn them on because it was so foggy. I rarely have to change it from ""Auto"", so it's easy to forget when I manually turn them on.

"I think ABE is about the same. I don't fly much, but always try to use the airport so they don't drop any more carriers or flights. I live real close, too, so get a ride and that saves money on parking. We used to take TransBridge to Newark but since Covid their trips are less frequent and MUCH more expensive. It's often cheaper to take the ""United Bus"" out of ABE to Newark. I have to agree that almost all the time you breeze right through everything at ABE. That one time you get behind some people flying international with 300lbs of bags is when you're running late (happened to me at ABE). Also, TSA used to be super fast with almost nobody in line. Now there are lines most of the time, but pretty short. I avoid Philly. It is the WORST airport for delays. Fact, due to flight pattern. Any weather of any kind and ATC increases spacing on planes and everything slows down a half hour almost instantly. This was explained to me when I sat next to a pilot once. Newark is...well...Newark. Lots of flights but we've nearly missed the United Bus connection while sitting on the runway waiting for our gate to clear for almost 90 minutes.

"It's all in person for the moving permit.

If you're moving into the city from outside the city, you don't need one. I got one for moving out of the city last year since it's technically required for it, but nobody checked it. I wanted to get one in case the police department wanted to see it when I requested a parking meter bag for parking the Uhaul I rented for moving out. I do highly recommend getting a parking meter bag if you're moving into/out of downtown to get a spot in front of where you're moving into. This you can get at the police station on 4th St for $15/day and you just need the park mobile ID of the parking meter. 

If you want to do it by the book to get a moving permit, fill out [this form](https://www.easton-pa.com/sites/g/files/vyhlif3076/f/uploads/movingpermitfillable.pdf#:~:text=Moving%20Permits%20are%20required%20to,the%20issuing%20of%20this%20permit.) out, then go to the Finance Department in the 2nd floor of city hall at 123 S 3rd St and they'll take care of it there and charge you.",t2_6u6dz,thetonyk123,0,1646927387.0,0,t1_i04a5v6,i04a5v6,True,[deleted],t3_t8zq1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/lehighvalley/comments/t8zq1g/does_easton_enforce_the_movingpermit_theres_a/,does Easton enforce the ‘moving-permit’ ? there’s a form but it says no paper after 2/28. there’s no option to submit electronically. and calling them is a nightmare. endless transfers and attitude problems.,/r/lehighvalley/comments/t8zq1g/does_easton_enforce_the_movingpermit_theres_a/i04a5v6/,1,r/lehighvalley,0,1

"Good safe area. I remember the first homes were built around 2006 and were pretty decent in terms of features/finishes, then when the market crashed they made them cheaper/junkier looking, like the vinyl siding was wavy looking when new and instead of decks they just nailed a piece of railing over the back sliding door. There was a builder called TH Properties that also built a lot of homes in that development and ended up going bankrupt in the wake of the market crash.


The development was open farm fields before it was built, so even though probably 14-15 years have passed since the first homes were built, there isn't much of anything in terms of shade or privacy between the homes. If you buy a house that backs up to open land owned by Jaindl, expect that something is going to be built there at some point.",t2_bthn9e0a,Glendale0839,0,1646712735.0,0,t1_hzsq624,hzsq624,True,kickedRock,t3_t976u5,https://www.reddit.com/r/lehighvalley/comments/t976u5/is_breinigsville_a_decent_place_to_live_anything/,Is Breinigsville a decent place to live?

"I know what you mean on the lack of wild nature spaces, that is a huge issue in Lancaster because the region is so heavily developed either with city, suburb, or farmland. I'm from Lancaster, so I know that area much better.

Lancaster city is quite wonderful in a lot of ways, although it has become more expensive lately with the influx of people moving out from NYC, telecommuting, etc. I very much like the west end of the city. There are places you can live where there are a lot of trees, and you can walk to lots of cafes, restaurants, bars, drug stores, and you can also walk downtown to the central market and various shops in the downtown. The area around Franklin and Marshall college is pretty nice but close enough to the downtown to walk there.

In terms of nature, there is the county park which is kinda southeast of the downtown and there are a few smaller, rather fragmented and degraded pieces of wild forest kinda on the west end of the city, but besides that you need to drive to find nature areas. There are some really beautiful and striking ravines and rugged terrain along the Susquehanna river, Chickies Rock between Marietta and Columbia, and then a lot of stuff farther south in southern Lancaster county along the river. The northern part of the county also has this huge ridge with large unbroken tracks of forest, good hiking. And there are a few pockets of hilly, wooded areas in the kinda south-central to eastern parts of the county, but that's pretty much it, most of the rest of the county is all farm with an (unhealthy) dose of suburb.

As for the Lehigh Valley area, if you decide to go more up that way, so far my favorite part of it is Bethlehem. A lot of people in this thread recommended me to look at the west end of Allentown, but I found it lacked the sort of organic distribution of businesses that was necessary to make it walkable, like it was too much 100% residential stuff spreading out for miles, and the businesses were too concentrated in a small area in/near the theater district. I can't do that. Bethlehem though has both a nice downtown and south Bethlehem was kinda cool, and both had more of the sort of mix of businesses and residential in neighborhoods with walkable, tree-lined streets that I like. South Bethlehem has that ridge right there too, and then there is that small trail along the river, so it seemed to offer more nature stuff nearby. Plus there was a sichuan restaurant that was not bad, and that is always a plus for me!!!

This all may be a moot point because it's going to depend on what happens with my girlfriend's job offers which we are still hearing back from, we were just doing some preliminary looking and the big part of it was to see ""Do we like this area?"" to guide whether or not she wanted to apply to / accept certain positions over others.

> Philly was not it for me. The townships around are maybes but not particularly thrilling ideas as a single 30s woman. 

I also have lived in Philly. I lived in West Philly which was I think the best match for me in the city limits but it still was a bit much for me. Outside of Philly there were some areas that I liked, but nothing really felt ideal to me. I like the area around Ardmore but much of the main line bit too upscale / old money for me. I like Jenkintown and Cheltenham township, but much of the nothern suburbs are very generic suburban. Jenkintown had a nice small town vibe and was super walkable, but it lacked much racial / ethnic diversity, and especially as you go north of there into Abington township, there is palpable racism and I just didn't like the general attitude people have, like I felt like they liked cars and box stores.

The only other place I really like in the Philly metro area is on the NJ side, Collingswood, which I love and would live in if I ever needed to live over on the NJ side like if I had a job over that way or something.

"Welcome to Lehigh Valley!  

Huh, we moved from Texas to Allentown a couple of years ago.  We miss Texas.  We cried the first time we had Mexican food here—we lived in El Paso (UT, awesome city) so you can’t really beat it.  Then again pizza and cheese steaks were mostly terrible there.

I’m native to New England (we met in NC but she’s from here) but lived all over the country, so this is my POV: 

West End of Allentown might be good, Rodale tracks and hiking paths are on the west side.  Check out Rodale track, buts it’s just a big over loop.

Bethlehem is in the news quite a bit but there’s also nice parts.  Not bad if you don’t mind the drive into Allentown.  Steel Stacks has stuff going on often.  Temple University has some sort of medical school in Bethlehem, might be good place to meet others if like mindedness.

"Allentown isn't the worst city in the state; but no, it's not great. It has the higher crime rate in the area, and is pretty run down. Covid made it worse. On top of that it's a city of narrower one-way roads, and for whatever reason people in the city love to double-park. Bethlehem is next to Allentown and is significantly better. Southside Bethlehem used to be a little rough, but the city has done a really good job at cleaning it up. There's a historic district, solid bars, and a sweet local venue (look up the steel stacks). Also Easton is pretty nice as well. It's down Route 22 from Allentwon (about 30-45 minute depending on traffic), and if you've gotten a job with LVHN (one of the two main health networks in the area) 22 will bring you to most of their facilities. 

Otherwise there are a patchwork of smaller towns throughout the area that are fine. They're pretty much what you would expect for a small town, but if you're trying to meet folks B-town or Easton would be the better bet.
