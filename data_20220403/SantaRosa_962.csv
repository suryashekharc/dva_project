"Spoken like someone that has never worked in the industry. Quit thinking like a doo gooder, capn save ho for a minute. Lets say that you are the one looking for work at a restaurant. You have the choice of 2 different restaurants both very similar in the type of cuisine and business model. Restaurant A has a no tip policy. They are offering $25 an hour. Restaurant B allows tipping and is offering around minimum wage $16 an hour plus tips.                                                                                                                                                  
At restaurant (A) you will make a guaranteed amount of money based on the hours you work. No more no less. The effort you put in to the quality of service you provide will be directly effected by the fact that you do get tips.                                                                  At restaurant (B)    The amount of potential earnings are based on your performance. You still will make a guaranteed amount of money based on the hours you work. $9 less and hour but you get to keep your tips. If you do not put forth a great effort into proving excellent service you here, you might as well quit before you get fired. The quality of service you provide here determines the amount of money you take home. This motivates you to provide the best possible service that you can provide. A decent bartender at a decent bar can easily make anywhere from $10 an hour to over $100+ an hour based on the day of the week and shifts worked.                                       
 A waiter or waitress can make even more money working less hours than the bartender. You are on the wrong side of this by trying to take away their performance based pay ""TIPS"" To Insure Proper Service.  If someone is crying about not making enough money working at a restaurant then they need to up their service effort or find another job. The only employees that should be paid more is the kitchen staff. Most businesses have a policy in place to have their wait staff and bartenders tip out the kitchen staff. However in my experience the kitchen staff ends up not getting tipped out as much as they  should. They are the ones that are making the wait staff look good so in turn the customers are happy and tipping the server. You start this non tipping nonsense, its not over fair wages. It is because you have no clue about the industry and you are cheap.",t2_dtymz5g8,EmotionalClub3511,0,1648984156.0,0,t1_i37lrz8,i37lrz8,True,Adorable-Ad-3223,t3_tqpkp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/tqpkp3/tip_free_food_joints_in_santa_rosa/,Tip Free Food Joints in Santa Rosa?,/r/santarosa/comments/tqpkp3/tip_free_food_joints_in_santa_rosa/i37lrz8/,-1,r/santarosa,0,-1

A lot of people are saying drinking is the whole social scene here. I can't comment on that because I actually moved here to get into sober living haha. I've lived here ever since, 6 years later!

But even if you're not sober because you have to be, there are plenty of things to do that don't involve drinking.

"No. Doordash alone is not worth it. You have to be very careful about what you accept.

Don't pick up from the mall you have to pay for parking and if takes forever.

Wing stop? Lol just don't. Ever. They take 40 minutes 10 minutes after the order is ""ready""

Mary's? They can be very very rude

Don't ever take an order if it's not $1.50/mile.

People who put ""will tip in cash"" generally don't.

Pot heads are the best tippers *ever*

Crumble is amazing and pays pretty good too.

You'll need a cooler in the trunk and a hot /cold bag. Use a cleaning caddy(holds the cleaning sprays?) for the large drinks (6 large ice coffees fits nicely and no cardboard to rip and drop the drinks!)

Since you do not have a food handlers certificate you literally cannot look in the bags to ensure items are present but it's all your fault anyway.

Memorize the support number. You're going to need it.

Restaurants where YOU place the order are absolutely not worth it.

Supermarket grocery orders (looking at you Safeway!) are usually not worth it. They will try to get you to carry the groceries into the house like old times.

If the store is closed you are now about to waste 45 minutes of your time to get paid half of the promised money.

Acceptance rating means nothing.

Dasher and completion rating will get you kicked off if too low (I got a 1 because the witch didn't give any directions. She lived behind a huge fence with no driveway or walkway and no lights. You literally couldn't see the house in the dark but that was clearly my fault dropping my rating to 4.6 from 4.9!)

"> Amazing you were downvoted for telling people you have homeless living next to you. Wtf. 

Doubt it has anything to do with that. It’s probably the fact he keeps referring to them as bums which is a derogatory term for homeless individuals. Before anyone argues about bum being a derogatory term, the definition of a bum in the dictionary is also a lazy or shiftless person. And let’s just remember that a lot of people lost their homes or housing, due to covid. A lot of homeless people are veterans or even still hold jobs.

"Even if you're not drinking, the Coppola winery has a world class restaurant, classy film memorabilia, a classy pool and grounds.

Check ahead on the swimming thing and get reservations for the restaurant. Save room for dessert.

"aye am way morre than surprised that nobody even mention the sonoma development center. my mother and father were janitors at the sonoma development center. they were never allowed in the tallest oldest building there that was last used in 1905 because it's been locked since then. when you walk by oh man you feel the energy coming from the windows. it's where they would burn the dead mental peoples bodies at the very bottom. I once had the balls to walk up to the front two door which mind you were like 15 feet tall huge and bulky straight from the early 1900s and prior to that all of the 1800s. i couldn't see much but the first thing in front of you was a stair case going straight up into pure darkness. fuck that shit blood on everything I know there's something demonic in there. anyways everyone lost there jobs due to it being shut down In the 80s because many many many and many reports of the actual doctors or nurses or whatever it's called that takes care of the mental people, walk them, and what not would abuse them and throughout it's usage there were many cases of the mental people dying. everything there was built in the 1800s and is abandoned. but there's beautiful trails but it starts to get creepy in the woods all by yourself especially when the sun's going down. it's trails connect to jack london state park. sonoma development center is in Glen ellen CA. I'm telling you the whole place is haunted there was even a documentary on YouTube search up the name and then put haunted and you'll see. there all abandoned as I was saying but it's that brick made tall old black windowed building that has something worse than the others. mark my words.... oh and to make matters worse it has that carnival horses thing that spins in a circle I forget the name sorry I'm working on my English but it's the thing where kids go on the horses that move up and down while the whole structure is going in circles playing music. well of you know what I mean there's also one of those just dead. abandoned.  black mold straight horror film looking. it's super scary..",t2_f7twa5y4,Fantastic-Mud2054,0,1648416333.0,0,t1_i2d0o5e,i2d0o5e,True,MGTS,t3_h0ocs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/h0ocs4/does_santa_rosasonoma_county_have_any_good_ghost/,Does Santa Rosa/Sonoma County have any good ghost stories?,/r/santarosa/comments/h0ocs4/does_santa_rosasonoma_county_have_any_good_ghost/i2d0o5e/,1,r/santarosa,0,1

"Hey! I'm a local Orthodox Chrisitan with a bunch of friends and people I know at Saint Peter and Paul's, but I go to [Saint Seraphim's](https://saintseraphim.com/our-parish/) down on Santa Rosa Avenue. We are part of the OCA which is the Orthodox Church of America. St. Peter & Paul's is part of a jurisdiction called [ROCOR, or the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church_Outside_of_Russia). 

When the Russian revolution happened, a lot of people fled as refugees from the new USSR, and the people over here already made their own churches while many of the refugees founded ROCOR to specifically not be tied to the administration in the old country. Their founding hierarch was actually from Kyiv, and there are a lot of Belorussian, Georgian, Ukrainian, Carpatho-Russian, etc people who helped found it who were not ethnically Russian at all.  It wasn't until 2007 that Moscow and ROCOR reached an agreement to unite again, and ROCOR still is functionally autonomous.  Similarly, the ""russian"" side of the schism in Ukraine is semi-autonomous, is lead by a native Ukrainian from western Ukraine, and since the war has begun has now moved pretty drastically to being fully separate from the Moscow patriarchate. [Here is a statement about how Putin is committing the sin of Cain and is fully at fault, which is about as strong and direct as you can get. It is not in English, but google translate can help you.](https://news.church.ua/2022/02/24/video-zvernennya-blazhennishogo-mitropolita-onufriya-ukrajinskoji-pastvi/)ROCOR[has made statements like the one here about the war](https://www.synod.com/synod/eng2022/20220303_enmhbmo.html) and[here where it is more strongly condemmed](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-orthodox-clerics-stop-war-ukrane/31730667.html)

All that said, the vast majority of the people here, at Saint Peter and Paul's don't have that strong of ties to Russia. There's some for sure, but mostly of the ""grandpa was born there and fled. We visit once every few years."" There's also plenty of  Ukrainians, Georgians, Armenians, Eritreans, Serbs, Greeks and at least 50% American born converts.  At my church, the[press democrat did an article about our prayers for the end of the war](https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/a-day-of-prayer-for-sonoma-county-residents-with-ukraine-ties/) , but it was actually kind hard for me as an usher to find people who actually have ties to the old country in our 200+ member congregation.

I was a year zero freshman and the first half of the first year (1995?) we only had printed manuals for the camera they intended to buy. We got equipment by Q3. Gave us time to learn foundations and concepts I suppose.

I can only imagine that program got better once the community TV station was built.


Even though it didn't become my profession, I benefited from it. Years later I apply basic principals of videography that I learned in the program. Especially since the pandemic took everything over to remote video meetings. I cringe at some of the camera placement, lighting choices and background framing that people make with their webcams.

"As many other have said, ""are you tolerant of Christians"" is a different question from ""will I be easily accepted if I'm a conservative who wears a cross around my neck and bases his choice of living situation around religion and politics.""

Santa Rosa voted mostly for Bernie in the Democratic primaries, it's pretty liberal. We celebrate our LGBT neighbors and hate it when our police shoot citizens for no good reason or people from out of town come in with lifted trucks and giant flags and cause chaos. But it's also not Berkeley. In fact, nearly every city in the country is 60-80% Democrat and nearly every suburb and rural area is 60-80% Republican: no matter where you're at, getting along with your neighbors is going to require some tolerance and people who make waves will see some resistance.

This all has less to do with how you personally feel about your religion or politics, and more about whether you're nice to people who are different from you. If so, then we can probably get along. As you've hinted at, publicly displaying religious or political symbols invites questions about whether you ascribe to the stereotype you're portraying or not. If you don't like those questions or think your answers might invite conflict, maybe keeping those symbols to yourself might be more wise.

"The UC extension has some resources that can be helpful.

Are you looking to fill the entire thing? 11 acres without equipment or infrastructure is a lot. As I understand it you only need to prep the field once, so you could probably rent equipment for that. Harvesting is going to be the real trick.

You need to look at pest control, gophers being a big one, and irrigation. Young plants of this type need irrigation, and these days even mature plants can't be trusted to the weather. The drought is a bit much to say the least and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. You need drip lines running the whole thing and obviously a water source. Between probably composting, renting equipment, irrigation and the actual plants you're looking at a lot of up front cost. And you're going to be out of time in about a month if you want to establish plants this season.

Farming, as I was just talking to my father about, is a book keeping business. Thinking of it as a business is important. So - do you have a pipeline for selling? Do you know who's buying, and their current prices? How well do you know the market? Are you interested in secondary products, or just selling as a commodity? Do you have a source for starts lined up (I'd avoid seeds)? 

Secondary, value added products are a great choice for direct to consumer sales. But you'll need to have pretty serious expertise to do it right.

There's a lot to it, most of it coming from the business side. There's a big question of how much you want to invest in infrastructure.

Since lavender is a flowering plant with good nectar availability I'd also look into integrating bees. You could probably partner with a bee keeper and get a secondary market out of it.

There's a pretty huge number of variables that really depend on you, your goals and your current knowledge. You can hire a farm manager, but you'll need to understand what you're hiring them to do. And you'll have to be able to predict costs and revenue enough to cover payroll.

If you're not in a position to invest in that kind of equipment, you can start small. Depends on your financial situation with the land and what it cost to hold. But if you want to ease into it, start slow and develop a good farm system before you buy 11 acres worth of starts.

A quick search tells me we have at least one successful farm here, so you should research what they do and how they make it work.

If you don't want to learn farming and just want an investment, lease the land and forget about all of this.",t2_4a0m75no,shredinger137,0,1647845231.0,0,t1_i1i3eby,i1i3eby,True,thirdeyefrozen,t3_tj40c3,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/tj40c3/need_help_with_planting_lavender_on_a_few_acres/,Need help with planting lavender on a few acres,/r/santarosa/comments/tj40c3/need_help_with_planting_lavender_on_a_few_acres/i1i3eby/,16,r/santarosa,0,16

"The trick is to keep your faith personal. Express your faith in church, or in your home, or in places where it's already established to be a religious gathering. If you're out in the greater public and announcing that you're Christian and using it as a defining characteristic of yourself, people are going to be put off by it. Some of them because of the very real damage that the church has done in this world, and some because that behavior is approaching ""crazy doomsayer ranting on the street corner"" levels and many people aren't prepared to deal with declarations like that.

You sound to me like your concern is less, ""will I be tolerated for being Christian"" and more ""I'm going to be loud and obnoxious about my faith, and I want to live somewhere where being performative like that won't be shunned"". Whether or not you think that way, it's what I'm gathering from this post.

I don't know you, I've never met you, and I don't have ill will towards you. You sound like you're looking for a place to live that is exclusively your flavor of Christian and one that will accept you entirely. This kind of place doesn't exist though, not outside of a religious compound. There are hundreds of thousands of people in Sonoma County, 40 million+ in California, and not every one of them is going to like and accept you uncritically.

If you want to move to Sonoma County, do it! It's an incredible land and the people are kind, both the secular people and the religious.

Those links have not been updated since 2009 but they show population percents of various religions sufficiently represented in these counties. I do not know how the numbers are derived but they appear to be republishing data from *Religious Congregations and Membership in the United States: 2000*, from the Glenmary Research Center. It's probably data voluntarily submitted by congregation leaders and likely incomplete.

Sonoma County is secular, in public. Expect to treat and be treated by others in as secular manner: polite, friendly, but not in any religious or anti-religious way. I don't encounter anyone expecting a moment of prayer before a non-religious meeting or saying grace before a shared meal in mixed company.

There are a lot of religious assemblies of both Christian and non-Christian faiths so there is a significant percent of faithful but it's a diverse percent which co-exists without any problems that I'm aware of. I have had the occasional co-worker who will talk a little about faith but it never becomes a negative; it's discussed in friendly, respectful ways.

We're also a tolerant community, in general; those on the LGBT spectrum and non-Christian faiths exist comfortably here. People living *non-traditional lifestyles* are accepted members of the community. ""Live and let live"" is a good descriptor.

Signals of personal faith are common and unremarkable. No one will care if you wear a cross or have a sticker on your car.

I'm going to refrain from commenting on politics because politics =/= religion. You can check out the county's voting patterns if you think it will inform your personal concerns.

You will almost certainly find a congregation or group which speaks to your beliefs. The community outside of that group really won't care what your faith is, provided you aren't trying to harm others with it.",t2_414zo0js,Reference_Freak,0,1647772520.0,0,t1_i1e0q2c,i1e0q2c,True,LoveJesus101,t3_tie29c,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/tie29c/is_sonoma_county_friendly_to_christians/,Is Sonoma county friendly to Christians?,/r/santarosa/comments/tie29c/is_sonoma_county_friendly_to_christians/i1e0q2c/,7,r/santarosa,0,7

I began checking out weather apps and still lost all UNTIL I found Wunderground, by far the most accurate. All weather is taken from two places in Santa Rosa, downtown on third Street and at the airport. Wunderground (short for Weather Underground) takes their reports provided by individuals throughout Santa Rosa, over 300 of them. I can be watching the radar showing where the clouds are in real time and have predicted when it will start raining over our home in East Santa Rosa, accurate within 30 seconds! Never have another false report again with Wunderground, a free app in the App Store. This app is available for everyone else too, no matter where you live. CHECK IT OUT! 👍🏻 😊

"So we are from San Mateo county and are considering Sonoma county because it is much more affordable and has great weather(compared to the cheaper areas eastward). But we are wondering how friendly Sonoma is to Christians and ppl with more traditional views? Here in San Mateo it is live and let live but there is still some negative feelings towards Christians from liberals. People in general are more secular and the area has a more secular vibe to it(with the exception of certain ethnic catholic communities). Now we know that no where in the Bay Area is going to be all that Christian or conservative, but we are wondering where Sonoma falls on the scale? It is just north of Marin, which is even more liberal than the peninsula. Is it as leftist as places like SF or Berkeley or is it more moderately liberal? How are Christians viewed there? How are ppl with more conservative views viewed there? It is a more rural county but it’s proximity to SF and Marin makes us feel it’s not going to be all that different.

"A little bit of rain about 7am on the coast. Big disappointment as I was hoping to awaken with the rain falling, but it was dry when I got up at 6am.

I think the weather people always over-predict rain, because its better to say it's going to rain but then it doesn't, than to say it's not going to rain, and then it does!

If you watch the hourly weather prediction you'll often see the rain predicted for a certain block of time get pushed out later and later.

If you can afford to buy now and want to buy, buy. If you can't afford to buy now, it's unlikely prices will shift enough such that you can. You're gonna have to change something about your ability to afford a home (or choose to -- if you can -- start with a less expensive property).

basic supply and demand has ""ceteris paribus"" as a pre-requisite and does not always describe the complexity that exists in real world economies.  

i'll give you that it certainly seems like we're headed for some shit, but if we get to the point where folks who have mortgages now are defaulting, well, I suspect being able to buy a home will be the least of our concerns.",t2_4kmow0hm,wolffartz,0,1647642398.0,0,t1_i17mxwk,i17mxwk,False,SeanCingh,t3_tgs7jr,https://www.reddit.com/r/santarosa/comments/tgs7jr/rich_ppl_moving_in/,Rich ppl moving in?,/r/santarosa/comments/tgs7jr/rich_ppl_moving_in/i17mxwk/,0,r/santarosa,0,0

"I can safely tell you this as a 50 year old who had the ironically good fortune to have completely destroyed his credit in college and shortly thereafter when he moved to Sonoma county in 1996, and didn't take my credit seriously for another 10 years. That easy buyer situation absolutely devastated the vast majority of my friend's finances. Seriously, crushed them. Yes, they bought homes. Over 2/3rds lost them. It was easy to finance but the shit collapsed like a house of cards. It's one thing to have an admittedly dog shit rent situation in present day. It's an entirely different thing to have a multi six-digit foreclosure on your credit report for the following 7 years. I know it sucks now but I can't tell you how much worse it was for the typical 30-year-old back in 2002 or 2010 who bought in a hyperinflated market a couple years earlier.

Fed announces a planned 7 rate hikes. This is going to put definite downward pressure on home prices around here as mortgages rise and leveraging homes starts to look dangerous.

"SUPPORT THE TEACHERS! FIX THE EDUCATION SYSTEM!

This is so sad to see.

So much for ""leadership"", and what a disappointing situation.

The administration has failed so completely and utterly in managing the economic needs of the district that they should all be fired in shame. 

Being a teacher shouldn't be synonymous with living in poverty. Nor should the administrators of public schools be driving luxury vehicles and taking their outrageously exorbitant salaries while they suck so bad at their job. Make administrator pay be based on the results they deliver for governing and supporting the education system.

How about a salary cut for the admins? They seem to be fine with cutting salaries and denying people a living wage and not funding the classrooms, so lets switch it up and cut salaries of administrators.

Replace the criminally incompetent admins with people who don't take the lion's share of funding for themselves and then squeeze the teachers dry and cancel programs instead of creating growth opportunities, forging creative partnerships with industry, fighting for change in Sacramento, and most importantly, putting the needs of the students first.

It's clear the current group of admins are incapable of performing their due diligence, and our students and teachers deserve better than to have their future and livelihood stolen by incompetent admins who can't even come up with a good excuse for their inability to be effective.

Shame on the admins, glory to the teachers, save the students, and heaven help us all as the people who will be taking over the world get less and less prepared for the challenge.

Dark times ahead for Santa Rosa, and we all get to suffer the rising tide of ignorant and incapable people who are passing through the school system with a certificate of attendance instead of a meaningful diploma.

"Full disclosure, my fiance is a teacher and I've had this exact conversation with her.  If you factor out the total hours worked over the year they actually do fairly well when looking at an hourly wage of 8 hours per day.  On average, a teacher makes about 45 an hour @ 65,000 per year.

Here's where your argument stops making sense though.  1) My fiance spends a ton of her own money on the students for activities, good behavior banks. etc.  2) Teachers spend a ton of time outside the 8 hour work day grading papers, preparing lesson plans, texting or calling parents, etc.  3) The big pensions you speak of are pretty non existent.  The board has removed several of those benefits.  I read further down you knew a teacher who was older and was well off.  Most teaching jobs today don't have anywhere near the benefits they did 20+ years ago when older teachers started.

The biggest issue the teachers are mentioning specifically in Rohnert Park/Cotati is they are 15% below the average pay scale of Sonoma County while admin are at or higher than the average pay scale and have great benefits.  Rohnert Park/Cotati teachers applied to earn higher pay to match the county average and the district replied with a 1 time 6% raise and that doesn't count as their highest pay when they do retire.  It's worth mentioning I'm not 100% sure about the last part but the gist of it is teachers need more money to survive in the county.
