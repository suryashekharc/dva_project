"Canton, Massillon, Navarre, North Canton, Canton South, East Canton...  It's all the same place; The ""Canton Metro.""  These areas are minutes away from each other.  You'll be driving in, out and through them on a weekly basis.  
  
Sure, North Canton is probably the ""nicest"" of them, but the second best -- whatever that city may be -- is just mediocre anyways.  And that right there is the thing about living in the Canton Metro.  Aside from the Hall of Fame, it's not *that* special of a place.

"I love Canton. I’ve lived here since 2009 and while I was born in Alliance, I’ve lived as far away as Honolulu, Hawaii. I’ve been around in my life. I’ve never found Canton to be a pretentious place if you know what I mean.  I find that people tend to be laid back. I remember I was at Bar one night with a bocci court and I there are people of different races and backgrounds and age groups all enjoying themselves playing bocci. The City is diverse and open in its own way. As has already been pointed out the Downtown is just wonderful. Great people and local businesses there that you can’t help but love and enjoy. The city has an excellent parks system with 60 parks in the City.  There is an excellent abs growing County trail network for biking and walking that is well integrated into the City with numerous access points. Some awesome neighborhoods and distinctive architecture. City services are overall pretty good. I think good old C-town is a great place to be. Once you’re here, I think it would sort of hard not to like the place.

They also have a farmers market there during nice weather. The Hall of Fame area will have a water park I believe built over the next years. There is also the village and a hotel being built there. Belden area has a large indoor golf and Dave and Busters now. It is still considered an upscale area there with houses near or on the lakes from mid 6 figures to 7 figures. Summertime there are tons of Farmers Markets to visit for fresh produce and the like. Being in Canton also gives you the option of further drives to large destination points. There's the zoo's in Akron and Cleveland, Cedar Point, attractions leading to Columbus.

"Downtown has developed as a close community and I like to promote it just to combat everyone defaulting to the Belden area. Just received a massive overhaul to the public square to support even more events and concerts, so check it out if you're in town. There's some hip places for younger audiences like a board game bar, two music-oriented bars, a bunch of art venues, two breweries, a theatre troupe, etc. There's also a number of quality restaurants and bars downtown that cater to more sophisticated tastes. The Palace Theatre is a community mainstay for movies and art films, and the Art Museum, Players Guild, Ballet, Choir, and Symphony all put on regular shows (pandemic relative). Monthly First Fridays continue to have big turnouts for shopping and entertainment. The Belden has continued to develop and has lots of opportunities for shopping, entertainment, and nearly every restaurant you could ask for. Other notable recent attractions in Stark are the lovely Gervasi Vineyards restaurants resort, Maize Valley Winery & Brewery, Hartville Marketplace & Flea Market, and the ever-expanding Stark Parks trail and park network. Overall, I've found the city to be a decent mix of entertainment and culture options with affordable prices and without having to travel forever or get stuck in traffic, but close enough to Cleveland for particularly large events. Things to watch for would be choosing the right neighborhood and school system for your needs if you're going to raise children.

Yes.

No. But, when I pulled into the parking lot, my fiance asked what he was doing. He said ""catching a ride"" and then walked away.

I would assume so. But I didn't notice. His head was lined up almost perfectly with the middle seat of my 3rd row. I don't think I would have noticed at all if not for his hair blowing in the wind.

"How big of a city are we talking here?

Cleveland or Akron might be a better bet (or Columbus)?

If you're moving back for friends a support system (family or whatever), that makes a bit more sense but it'll probably still be tough.

That said, lots of cool things have happened with Canton's nightlife in the past 15 years. First Fridays and night life (at least prior to COVID) isn't too shabby. The arts district is cool and fun to walk through. THE HOF development seems to be coming along decently well. Belden/The Strip seems to keep growing.

And personally, despite the fact that I've lived in big cities (SF/NY/LA), the thing I always miss the most is the food (and sweets) in Canton. It's always fun to return to that.

"Hello fellow Ohioans, I'm not from Canton but I was doing some research and stumbled across this neat little piece of history.

 from the article:


> Not long after the Stock Market crash of 1929, Dueber-Hampden, a watchmaker based in Canton, Ohio, went bankrupt. Slow sales and the tumultuous financial state of the world no doubt played a factor. But according to some historians, the operation was using outdated technology while other watchmaking outfits in the U.S. were the envy of the world. In 1930, Dueber-Hampden’s tooling and equipment were loaded into boxcars. Their destination, along with 21 former Dueber-Hampden employees? Moscow. This equipment and the know-how of these employees — along with additional gear from Ansonia Clock Company (another failed U.S. clockmaker) — would help form the basis of the First State Watch Factory, and subsequently the beginnings of the entire Russian watch industry, which would become one of the most successful in the world. Up to this point, watches in were in short supply in Russia and were either imported or cobbled together in small workshops from Swiss-made movements and parts. In either case, watches were not an of the people kind of good. Within the next decade, Russia was producing hundreds of thousands of watches. Many were based on old Dueber-Hampden pocket watch designs...",t2_5ysj4,eskimoexplosion,0,1643555213.0,0,t1_huuxsne,huuxsne,True,eskimoexplosion,t3_sgb1i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/sgb1i0/almost_the_entire_russian_watchmaking_industry/,"Almost the entire Russian Watchmaking industry started in Canton, OH",/r/canton/comments/sgb1i0/almost_the_entire_russian_watchmaking_industry/huuxsne/,10,r/canton,0,10

"Soooo the plan has been to convert the top two floors into condos and turn the bottom floor into a nice retail space.  These are plans that have been in the works for at least a decade.  The project started to pick up speed a couple of years ago, but fell apart because the funds that North Canton provided were reallocated to different projects, including the HoF village.  North Canton sued.

Recently, the project started up again and the company running it applied for a Historical Site grant.  They were rejected (I think probably because of reallocating the funds years earlier).

Honestly, that building means A LOT to the city.  It was the central hub of North Canton.  During the 20th century, the Hoover Family pretty much *made* North Canton what it is.  Price Park, the YCMA Community Building, Hoover Farm, the schools, even City Hall -- they all benefited from the Hoovers generosity.  Hell, probably a third of the homes in North Canton were commissioned by the Hoovers during the Baby Boom.

"No, you're in a great location! Directly between Akron and Canton. I feel like everyone thinks where they live has nothing to do unless they're in a big city or something. But I disagree!

Idk what all you're into, so send me a message if you want any more suggestions, but here's a list to start you out:

Canton/North Canton: The Auricle (closed for January right now, but bar/live music/dance nights/karaoke/trivia/etc). Milestone (board game bar). Buzzbin (bar/live music). Muggswigz (coffee shop. Occasionally open mics/live music). First Fridays (downtown Canton - live music, art galleries, small shops, local vendors with booths, etc etc). Light Up Downtown (at Christmastime, similar to First Friday). Outrage Rage Room (in Hartville. You can go in and smash stuff). Canton Charge (basketball). Palace Theater (movies, live music and entertainment, etc). Tinseltown (movie theater). Cinemark movie bistro(Dine-in movie theater). Player's Guild (live theatre). North Canton playhouse (also live theatre).  Other bars: Shale, Canton Brewing company, Town tavern, jerzees, George's, etc. Belden Village Mall, The Strip, etc for shopping. 

Akron: Musica (live music/bar). EJ Thomas Hall (live music, theatre, symphonies, etc). Other live music: Goodyear theatre, Akron Civic theater, Annabell's, Jilly's music room, etc. Akron Roller derby. Akron rubberducks (baseball). In the summer, there's a one-day festival in Highland Square, where local artists perform on people's front porches (called Porchrokr).

It's tragic any time a life is taken needlessly, and I'd like to know why the officer didn't identify himself until after the fact, but this is hardly on par with a hate crime.  When the best argument they have is ""The neighborhood where Williams lived has a long-standing tradition of celebratory gunfire to ring in the new year,"" that's pretty much no argument at all. Just ask any junkie who has a long-standing tradition of shooting up every day and now finds his/her self in jail. 

They make sure to mention that the AR-15 belonged to the wife. Wondering if perhaps the husband had a record and was legally prohibited from owning a firearm. And that the cop watched him go inside, then come back outside to fire a 2nd time ... that's more than a little sketchy right there. (It also makes me suspicious that the victim didn't know the cop was there, which would kind of negate the need for the cop to ID himself before he started shooting.)

I was also a little taken aback by the gofundme goal of $50k ""for funeral and living expenses."" Not even funeral and legal expenses? That sounds a little sketch to me, too.

"Yeah people are downvoting you but I'm going to bump it too. I don't like police brutality/racism, but this is not what that is. People were shooting, police were called, he was there when more shots rang out which would be very easy to get jumpy at, which isn't great, either. I don't live in a great neighborhood either and thought some of the 'fireworks' were guns by the sounds, heard one too many gunshots in this neighborhood as it is, hell, had a 5-10 man shootout behind my house one evening a few years ago it was fucking terrifying.

I understand this guy didn't seem like someone trying to be a criminal or trouble maker, and I feel bad for his family, the whole situation sucks ass. This whole thing was a tragedy either way. But it doesn't matter what ""other people"" in the neighborhood might be doing, it's still illegal, and it's still a deadly weapon that's going to cause damage if it hits anything, and also of equal importance, is it's not something to be teaching your kids is 'ok', go get some regular celebratory things and stop using weapons to do it, hurting people accidentally, potentially, when firing these as a toy, whether you see where the bullet lands or not, is not 'cool' and 'fun' it's it's irresponsible, and breeds a culture of irresponsibility where we have even more gun toting nuts everywhere that want to play around like this is the wild west and they're Yosemite Sam, and I dunno about you, but I don't want to live like it's an unstable area of the middle east where I feel like I have to carry a rifle everywhere I go.

It's not driving a car where you might have accidentally hit someone and killed them. It's a deadly weapon meant to kill, that is it's primary purpose, it's not meant to be a toy, end of discussion. Every bullet fired from that doesn't disappear, it will come back down, and you can't control where it's going to hit, it could kill someone in the next town over, or put a hole in someone's roof, or a hole through their car. It's a weapon designed to kill, it's not a toy, and in case discharging firearms in the city outside of self defense is not lawful here.

If they wanted to celebrate more legitimately they should have got some fireworks, which technically, are not actually supposed to be blown off in the city proper, either, but their primary usage is not ""deadly weapon"" and chances someone is going to show up, nervous, with a gun out, ready to defend their own life and others, is far, far, smaller.

The TL;DR of it is: This was a tragedy, but it's a weapon not a toy, if you play with a weapon, the police are going to think you're trying to kill someone, and they're going to show up in a defensive posture before they even know what's going on.",t2_7c93n,GimpyGeek,0,1642820133.0,0,t1_htowseu,htowseu,False,PrincipallyMaoism,t3_s9o2k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/s9o2k1/canton_police_murder_man_in_his_backyard_as_new/,"Canton: Police Murder Man in His Backyard as New Year Begins, Community Demands Justice",/r/canton/comments/s9o2k1/canton_police_murder_man_in_his_backyard_as_new/htowseu/,7,r/canton,0,7

"There isn’t much retail until you head south to New Philadelphia (which still doesn’t have all that much), or North into Fairlawn/Cuyahoga Falls. Green definitely has its fair share of businesses but it doesn’t have some of the businesses a “major” retail trade area would have. Best Buy at the Strip for example is the only one until you get to Chapel Hill / Cuyahoga Falls. Also, surrounding cities like Green, Hartville, North Canton, Jackson Township etc are all affluent and are growing. 

One problem with Belden Village though is that it sucks up all the opportunity for Stark County, thus Canton City has a hard time attracting businesses due to Belden Village being so close. A good example of this is the US 62 stretch on the East side of canton. 

As an Akronite, a similar example is how Cuyahoga Falls (Howe rd, portage crossing areas) all border Akron, and pretty much poach a lot of businesses formerly residing in North Akron.",t2_1ibal8pw,JishtheMish7,0,1642635331.0,0,t1_htdyeei,htdyeei,True,Mattntracy44,t3_s7fqh2,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/s7fqh2/belden_village/,Belden Village,/r/canton/comments/s7fqh2/belden_village/htdyeei/,7,r/canton,0,7

My class started the GO50 which is where you still got 50% of the credit even if you did absolutely no work so they could start sliding kids through.

Heritage Christian which is private and a Montessori school which is technically public but has a lottery to get in. In city/plain? Too many students per classroom, not enough teachers to even attempt, funding for the schools was there but only for new buildings and sports teams not for school equipment or teacher salaries. Superintendents get paid, school boards don't care, policies make zero sense. We can keep jacking up property taxes through levees but where does that money go? Not to the kids, not to the teachers.

Speaking of property taxes, most home owners here are elderly on pensions or social security that are being priced out of their already paid for homes.

"That's what I just posted in my comment! Rent around here everywhere is ridiculous. We're a family a 6 and thankfully my husband recently fell into a good paying job but before then there was absolutely no way we could afford hardly anything. $1200/month for rent? WHO?!? All the business professionals live in North Canton, Green, Jackson, Hartville...all of them are commuting from other areas. You couldn't catch a lawyer living downtown in one of those no matter how ""luxury"" you try to make it. Unless you happen to know someone who knows someone the likelihood of falling into a job around here high paying enough to afford anywhere around here anymore especially downtown is zero. My husband worked at Republic until a generator blew and they laid off like 150 people. Even those jobs don't last. As soon as you get close to getting union or something happens to their profits boom gone. McDonald's and Walmart aren't going to cut it. We were one of the hardest hit areas during the 08 recession with 9.8% unemployment and even now nothing recovered to where it was before. You can't take what was the blood of the city cut it off and expect it to still thrive.

"As someone with a family, I don't feel like the area is very family friendly. I have 4 kids and there isn't a ton to do. There's first Friday and third Thursday but that's more for adults than anything.

Jobs. We have no real job sector here. Most of my peer group joined the military to get out of here because the opportunities were so slim. The jobs here are so fleeting.

No help for anyone who needs it. Do we have section 8 yes but it's a 3-4 year wait. Do we have Catholic charities? Yes but you have to call at the exact time and day and even then they might not have enough or can help you with what you need. Homeless? Not very many shelters, especially family friendly ones and not anything really consistent but one.

Crime. We have so much crime whether it be petty theft to murder. We have several unsolved hit and runs, murders etc. Break INS unless it's for insurance purposes may as well not even be bothered to be reported because even if you have the person clear as day on camera it doesn't matter. They have to actually catch them in the act of doing it or else it just goes into a drawer and forgotten about.

No representation. Honestly I can't even remember ever meeting any of our congressional or local reps. Congressional guy for our area is fantastic and helpful but even still I don't ever remember other than a sign seeing or hearing about any events. Nothing seems to get done because the politicians in our area seem to be completely out of sight/mind unless it's an election year and all we get are radio/tv ads and signs.

Trash. So. Much. Trash. Other than community service servers and myself and a few random people I see more people throw trash down than clean it up.

Buildings/homes. Even though getting people help who are homeless especially those with substance issues/mental issues should be #1, keeping up with the general cleanliness and beautification of the city should be up there. I mean downtown LOOKS nice but go 3 streets in either direction and it instantly turns into abandoned, falling down, run down homes and buildings that not only don't help the look or feel of the city but also give more opportunities for crime.

Landlords..well slumlords. Over the last 7ish years, cities around us have cracked down on slumlords. Canton seems to be filled to the brim with them and courts seem to back them even though generally speaking what they do is illegal and they don't care. There's also no recourse for bad landlords. It's not like there's a bunch of rent opportunity here and a lot of the homes are owned by the same few companies so if something happens to you at one place it's not easy to run and find another.

Canton needs people who care about it's citizens first and HOF money second. We can spend years on BS projects out of Towner's usually only see 1 week a year. We can pour millions twice over to build, then rebuild a stadium but as for the people who live here all year.. NAH you get nothing. No pride as a city. We've become so desensitized especially in my age range (I'm 29 husband is 36.) We were born into opportunity then became adults when it was all stripped from us with no hope for a future here. You used to be able to make just enough to live here but not enough to leave but that isn't even true anymore. You can't even make it here because rent on Cherry is $925/month for a crap apartment surrounded by no opportunities.

"I had typed out a huge comment but I realized it can be summed up a lot shorter.

We grew on the rust belt, industrial jobs. A lot of those are obsolete. We need more modern, well paying jobs to truly help. Not with 25 years of experience either. That may never be fixed but it would create a significant change. That being said,  we need someone to focus on creating a safe space for low income kids. Making sure they have food, basic clothing, medication, & toiletries. Kids will always be the future, and ours need to be championed. 

Also we need rich people to STOP making the apartments in downtown so FREAKING expensive. There’s no reason we should have $1k rent in downtown Canton (Onesto, Hercules).

"You're already off to a better start than the current attempts because you're asking for the public's opinion. The best way to improve a place is a bottom-up approach that takes the opinions and experiences of the general population instead of a top-down approach in which leadership determines what's best for the community.

The current Strengthening Stark initiative is a great example of what not to do. It's economic development snake oil. I'll give an example. Part of Strengthening Stark is trying to bring in more manufacturing jobs. If those jobs materialize, great. They'll give some people some work for a few years. But 19 of the 20 sectors that have experienced the greatest decline in recent decades all come from manufacturing. Leadership typically plans for the near future, not for the long-term. Manufacturing is a bad deal long term and the more reliance the county has on it, the more downturn we will experience once those jobs go away.

"I’ve been an assistant prosecutor for Stark County since 2012. For the majority of my time with the office I’ve worked in our felony criminal division. 

I was raised in North Canton but have grown to really love Canton and want to see it continue to improve. 

As others have said, downtown is very safe. And is downright deserted on weekends. There is crime, but it’s kept within pockets. 

Recently, the city has taken a lot of steps to “comeback”.  There’s pretty upscale apartments at the Onesto and Bliss Tower and Centennial Plaza provides an awesome public space for events. There’s also a really healthy amount of unique bars and restaurants. 

I’ve never not felt safe working downtown during the week. 

As for actually living, before I got married I lived on the NE side (5 years at 19th and Market and 3 years at 17th and Market and just outside of a lovely historic neighborhood called Ridgewood) and never had any issues. 

As for shopping you won’t do most of it in Canton anyway and certainly not in any of the bad areas.

"In case anyone finds this thread searching for the same thing.  Rainbow International of Canton was a complete scam.  The owner came out with his partner, who handles the reconstruction.  They talked a big game, but failed to deliver on anything.  A week after they came out, the reconstruction partner texted me that he was quitting because he couldn't stand to watch the owner keep scamming people.  I did some digging and found that sure enough, there lots of complaints (even for other branches of RI) about them using up all the insurance money for unnecessary things and then leaving people with no money left to do the actual repairs.  I also verified that this reconstruction dude did indeed only recently pair up with the owner, everything about his story checked out.  And sure enough, a little bit later, I got a text from the owner that he lost his reconstruction partner and promised to still help make me whole.  He kept trying to put me in touch with random contractors to do things bit by bit (instead of the 1 company does it all approach that they were originally supposed to do).  None of those people ever ended up responding to me anyways though.  He'd said he'd help me communicate with insurance, but in practice, he just was silent until I would poke and prod with questions and then get vague answers.  I think he realized he wasn't going to be able to scam me because I wasn't totally clueless and then just stopped putting any effort in, so I just let that communication fade.

Ended up getting a recommendation from a friend for a company called Paul Davis, who, as a whole, were pretty good.  But omg the project manager they sent out was pretty scummy.  He was very pushy about things, trying to push me on styles that aligned with his tastes instead of just giving me space to choose on my own.  Every concern that I brought up about anything, he'd respond very flippantly/dismissively and just brush me off, but then surprise, it would end up being an issue.  He straight up lied to me about a few things and I ended up in a payment dispute over a service that I was being billed for that was not provided.  He was terrible at scheduling stuff and inflexible in trying to work with our schedule, instead just having us wait for weeks on things and then suddenly have to drop everything when he said a painter would be showing up the very next day.  Didn't even communicate that the painter was also doing the bathroom floor.  Acted like we were being a huge annoying inconvenience to him when we'd want to price out different options for things instead of just letting him do whatever he wanted to *our* house.  Questioned all of our design choices, then turned around and said we made great choices at the end lol.  But, the biggest issue I have with him, is that he was planning to do something I believe would have been insurance fraud on our behalf and was telling us it was totally fine.  Thankfully, due to the payment dispute, he was removed from all of the closing process and the main office confirmed for me that what he'd been planning to send to insurance was not right and they would not do that.  So, bullet dodged there.  Oh, he was also a total dick about the payment dispute, and wouldn't accept my offer of just knocking a small amount off for the hassle it caused us instead of taking the entire line item off.  In the end because he made a stink about it and I fought it, the company ended up taking the whole line item off anyways.

I will say though, that Paul Davis as a whole did manage to get everything done in the end and having all the estimates in the right format for insurance and them communicating with insurance was a big plus.  I do wish they'd have let us review things before sending to insurance though, because we ended up having a lot of back n forth that could've been avoided.  It just seems that one project manager was terrible, despite his attempts to mask it with confidence and energetic demeanor.  The contents manager was pretty nice though, although ultimately overpriced imo for just moving shit we'd already boxed up out of the house for 2 days while carpets were installed, but all that expense was approved by insurance so whatever.",t2_s79r4,NetworkingJesus,0,1634832476.0,0,t1_hhi79la,hhi79la,False,NetworkingJesus,t3_mrjgnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/mrjgnl/contractor_recommendations_for_insurance_repairs/,Contractor recommendations for insurance repairs?,/r/canton/comments/mrjgnl/contractor_recommendations_for_insurance_repairs/hhi79la/,1,r/canton,0,1

That's why they accuse anyone who's not a terminal TDS case of being in a Trump cult. Their cult of hate told them that everyone must be just as obsessed with that dude as they are. It's why they lump central moderates in with the right anymore. Anyone who's not *with* their hair-brained extreme agenda, is automatically *against* them. Gives them more people to feel justified in arbitrarily hating. The radicalized left doesn't care *how* miserable they make life for all our children. So long as they get to ""own"" the conservatives and moderates.

"That's the really odd bit: liberty dictates that anyone living in fear, would still be free to do so. It just wouldn't force everyone else to accommodate them, or to be responsible for their fears. 

Which makes it hard not to conclude that they either don't believe in the effectiveness of any of their precautions like, at all. *Or* that it's more about flexing on folks they don't see eye to eye with, and forcing them to bend the proverbial knee. Which only comes across as petty and tyrannical. 

It's kinda like that saying ""it's easy to be a communist in a free country. Try being free in a communist country"". Yet for some reason, those types always wanna drag everyone else down with them.

"Many formerly rational folk, have been completely broken by TDS. No longer able to have objective discussions about legitimate concerns, without shoehorning in the dreaded orange man that haunts their dreams. 

It's crazy how aggressively they project their obsession onto everyone else, too. As though him living rent free in their minds, must mean everyone else is equally obsessed. Like; ""If you don't irrationally hate the man, and make excuses for an objectively worse potus, then you must be in the Trump cult, hurr durr."" As though their inability to assess his pros and cons rationally, must mean the only options for *every*one are to either love him or hate him. 

It's just really sad how effectively the establishment was able to use his bombastic personality and buffoonish demeanour to fool so many tenuously engaged voters into voting against their supposed values. 
Even now that we're living through the greatest authoritarian threat to America in our lifetimes, there are still some simple dullards out there who believe *Trump* was the fascist  🙄

I just hope those poor souls can find their way back to sanity, and stop unwittingly shilling for the machine. Though I worry that Trump was exactly what said machine needed, to fool those who don't dig deeper than deliberately framed sensationalist headlines, into basically begging for the government to infringe on their personal liberties. Anything but the orange man, I guess. Even licking the boot, and condemning our children to tyranny  :(

Edit: one thing they are absolutely correct about, though, is that we are headed full speed for economic collapse. Largely due to the Biden administration's extended shutdowns and exorbitant spending. Though I wouldn't hold your breath for the TDS cult to ever admit any of Biden's clearly evident shortcomings. They kinda have to keep pretending he's a better option. Otherwise they'd have to admit they got played, and I just dunno if that crowd has the strength of character to ever acknowledge that.",t2_254mkett,DalekForeal,0,1633694417.0,0,t1_hfuemjg,hfuemjg,False,[deleted],t3_pfh6uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/pfh6uf/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/canton/comments/pfh6uf/deleted_by_user/hfuemjg/,1,r/canton,0,1

Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a homemade mask should only be considered as a last resort to prevent droplet transmission from infected individuals, but it would be better than no protection.


“Droplet” transmission happens when we sneeze or cough. 

Covering your mouth with your inner elbow when you sneeze and covering your face with your hands when you cough will prevent those droplets just as well. Plus, sneezing and coughing into a mask is obviously not good for ones health.

"I applaud that you agree vaccines are effective, especially after they pass full FDA approval like other historic and mandated vaccines such as smallpox, MMR, influenza, etc. 

[Here's a study from 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24229526/) that proves even home-made masks reduce transmission of airborne diseases. It predates Covid-19 era so it can't possibly be related to 'nutjob conspiracies' *some* people seem hyper focused on.

Your fear of ""psychological retardation"" is not as severe as your news outlets have made it seem to be. Studies on [Development of social cues](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/11/health/masks-child-development-effects-covid-pandemic-wellness/index.html) indicate children prefer reading context clues from the eyes, also body language, tone of voice, or GASP: verbally expressing your emotions. Seeing a mouth smile/frown is not necessary when children, humans in general, have so many other social cues to use. In fact: it might help them learn to be **more aware** of those other methods to communicate non-verbally!

Regarding ""rebound"" speed for children who ""missed out"" -- consider for example a child born with defective hearing who develop speech impediments: within a few years of having their hearing corrected they adapt and correct their speech naturally. One simple method to counteract this ""retardation"" of social skills you're worried about is by talking to your children face to face at home!

"Vaccines are like seatbelts. They work best to keep people safe when everyone in the car is wearing it. If you're wearing your seatbelt, it'll stop you from flying around inside the car but it won't stop you from getting walloped in a crash by your passenger when they go flying if they aren't wearing their own seatbelt. Vaccines require a community effort to be most effective. That's all vaccines. That's how they work.

Plus, hospital staff, particularly ER staff might disagree with your whole ""my decision not to get vaccinated only affects me"" ​attitude. I mean, Good lord pray to God that you don't need to visit the ER anytime soon or that you've got 6 hours to spare before you can be seen. There have been patients this month who sat all night in a certain area hospital ER waiting room with very serious conditions, like passing kidney stones or internal bleeding, that were never seen by a physician before they gave up and left.

Also, an anecdote to push back on your anecdote, the only people I've seen saying they want to get back to normal life are not vaccinated, almost always refuse to wear masks, and didn't have to lose a loved one to Covid. Losing a year and a half is not insignificant and I don't blame anyone for their anger and frustration and for wishing for life to go back.

"This guy is a quack.

Nuremburg Code of 1947 - had to do with EXPERIMENTAL medical *research*. Specifically: Nazi's would cut your eye-lids off to see how long it took you to go blind. THAT is what this code is written about, not about accepting a *scientifically proven medicine.*

The way he phrases the ""risk was manageable for my condition"" ... ""so I got the vaccine"" HOLD UP: There is something to say for for someone who has ""looked at significant amount of data"" vs someone who ""understands that data"". This guy obviously has a position of ""vaccine is more dangerous than COVID"".

""Now that the initial surge has passed"" presumes it cannot happen again. Even a cursory glance at COVID rates shows there has been at least 4 separate surges in Ohio (april 2020, july 2020, flu seasons 2020, unmasking in apr 2021, and OH YEAH: the current spike that is RISING with the same severity as FLU season!

"I'm no scientist but a vaccine that was developed 10x faster than normal and got FDA approval 10x-20x faster than normal AND hasn't proven it's ability to provide immunization from the delta variant seems like something a rational person would view as a risk maybe not worth taking. I'm more than happy to continue wearing a mask in public and continuing social distancing (sans business shutdowns) as a means to reduce the spread. Perhaps you didn't notice but the spread is rising not too long after everybody started taking off their masks because of the vaccine availability and the surge in cases indicates to me that the vaccine is not a one and done solution. If you are 100% onboard with getting the vaccine then just get it. If you believe it will protect you then you should also believe everybody that wants that protection can get it and the only people increasing their risk of covid related health issues are doing so of their own free will. I haven't gotten the vaccine yet. I'm sticking to masks where appropriate and as a homebody  find it easy to socially distance. What's ludacris to me in all of this is that all of the pro vax or die enthusiasts out there have no problem with ""super spreader"" events like concerts or sporting events becoming commonplace again because they just want ""back to normal"" in their social lives. Although this is clearly not the apocalypse that many believed it would be a year or a year and a half ago, there is not one easy ticket to get back to 100% normal just yet.",t2_54kne0qr,Th3PwnyExpress,0,1630457354.0,0,t1_hb4npt9,hb4npt9,True,[deleted],t3_pfh6uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/pfh6uf/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/canton/comments/pfh6uf/deleted_by_user/hb4npt9/,-15,r/canton,0,-15
"I think that a mandate would kill all discussion on the matter, and, especially in an academic setting, we want to set the example and standard that the better arguments and evidences win the day.  

There are people on the anti-side that, not because they don't believe the science behind vaccines is sound, and not because they believe the pandemic is media sensationalism, but because they wanted to wait it out, watch for how the rollout affected adverse reactions and immunity responses, and then make an informed decision based upon the evidence they had.  That's admirable, and I know a few people like this that have moved forward with getting vaccinated.  That's great!  We want that!

"*TL:DR - I'd suggest North Canton over Canton proper if it's in your budget.*

Well, that would depend a great deal on where you were thinking. I own my home located a few blocks from downtown Canton near Fulton/12th ST NW. I'd recommend avoiding this area at all costs. The noise, crime, traffic, and plummeting property values should scare off any potential home owner. That being said, there are some really nice areas in North Canton and places like the Avondale neighborhood that are really pleasant if you can afford them. That happens to be closer to Belden Village as well, which is the main shopping / restaurant district around here. 

Canton City Pros (IMO) Relatively cheap cost of living, downtown action (a few bars/clubs/music venues), first friday and community festivities, property tax is low-ish (I guess?), standard Ohio weather (expect the unexpected).

But to think that only “poor money” circulates displays a lack of economic knowledge on your part.",t2_c8fca516,MickMickelson,0,1626879765.0,0,t1_h60dlmm,h60dlmm,False,yo-dude-,t3_oocoiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/oocoiv/senate_leadership_just_released_a_huge_federal/,"Senate leadership just released a HUGE federal legalization proposal, but Portman is against it.

"Flat tax would be a tax hike for the poor and a huge tax break for the rich. I love the ""pit the poor against the rich"" argument too. The rich have been winning that war consistently since the Reagan era, period. 

Here's the thing about income and wealth. When you're poor or middle class, a very high percentage of your income cycles back into the economy in the form of commerce. Very little of that becomes ""wealth."" Once you make enough money that all of your basic needs and luxury wants are met, the excess gets invested in things and becomes wealth. At that point, the capital is indeed stagnant until the assets are sold. So someone making $500K/year isn't dumping $500K/year into the retail economy - most of it is being converted to wealth.

As for employment, except in specific circumstances, a person's personal income is not being used to employ people. Rich folks derive their high incomes through the operation of businesses that convert raw goods and the labor of employees into finished products and services that they sell for more than they cost to produce. The excess is net income, which is sometimes reinvested in the business and sometimes distributed to owners. Companies don't employ people out of charity - they do it so they can generate income for the company.

Look, I understand that none of this is going to change your mind, but I hope you can understand that there are structural problems in our system of taxation that have consistently benefitted the rich for at least the last 40 years and generated a wealth gap that continues to grow. No system of taxation is perfect, but the message that taxing very high levels of personal income a few percent more is going to tank the economy is downright greed.",t2_37645,cinch123,0,1626872082.0,0,t1_h5zxaec,h5zxaec,False,yo-dude-,t3_oocoiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/canton/comments/oocoiv/senate_leadership_just_released_a_huge_federal/,"Senate leadership just released a HUGE federal legalization proposal, but Portman is against it.

I just don’t think the house will carry any higher value than what it has now. But yes alliance is actually gross besides that immensely updated area near the get go on the main drag.

So if you look here... nicest areas are: plain (north canton), lake (hartville), nim (louisville), jackson (probably highest end, most doctors over at glenmore area and around hills and dales), & lawrence (canal fulton).

Downtown has gotten a LOT better.  Its pretty safe during day and during events.  Avoid night time, unlit areas, etc.  You'll survive.

I'd probably goto hartville or louisville personally if i was staying in area long term, but i like being on at least acre of ground... No close neighbors.

"Happy to help! And I can attest that It was circulated far and wide. I happened upon it on my city’s local fb group feed and i am from Ottawa, KS! Your friends’ search for Tyler’s jeep hit close to home for me because a close friend of mine lost her 17 year old daughter in a car accident in March. After the accident it was all hands on deck to try and find one of her daughter’s shoes that was misplaced during the crash. Family and friends made so many trips to the wreck site and sifted through weeds and mud and broken glass to look for that shoe, but to no avail. They had all but given up hope until the truck was released from impound, and they found it tucked under a seat! Her mom went on to wear that pair of shoes to receive her daughter’s honorary high school diploma at graduation the very next week. She didn’t get to walk at graduation, but her shoes did! ❤️ I am beyond glad to hear that Tyler’s mom found the Jeep and that the owner was happy to sell it back to her. I hope and pray that finding it brought her some peace and comfort. Please send some love to #teamTyler from #teamMaddie in Kansas for me.
