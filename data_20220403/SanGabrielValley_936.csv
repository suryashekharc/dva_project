"Good recs in this thread. My personal fav is Fiore Market Cafe in South Pasadena. Never disappoints me with their housemade bread and sweet pork belly.

I‚Äôll also give an honorable mention to Tartine‚Äôs newest location in Pasadena. I‚Äôd still place it squarely below some of the other recs here, if only because Tartine is more focused on bread than sandwiches, but taste is so subjective and I don‚Äôt want to let a good SGV newcomer go unnoticed.",t2_12ppofmw,CRT_SUNSET,0,1649005645.0,0,t1_i38s8bz,i38s8bz,True,deezy55,t3_tutjc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgv/comments/tutjc9/best_sandos_in_sgv/,Best Sandos in SGV?,/r/sgv/comments/tutjc9/best_sandos_in_sgv/i38s8bz/,1,r/sgv,0,1

"Cantonese style dim sum :
New Capital seafood in Rowland Heights. South of Fwy 60 at Fullerton Rd exit.
Happy harbor, on the other side of the freeway, but closer to Nogales exit.  This one is higher end than new capital and more expensive.  For me it's quite good but yelp ratings are not too high.

For the Western side of SGV, there's another New Capital but with different name, which is ""five star"" in San Gabriel.  Chinese names are the same for both locations but English names are different.

Or NBC seafood and Atlantic seafood in Monterey Park.

And also Lunasia dim sum in Alhambra, I think it has another branch in Pasadena, but I have only been to the one in Alhambra.  This one should be slightly higher end than New Capital.

Top Island in Alhambra, this one is similar to New Capital.  Food is OK but not fancy.

Please remind dim sum is only for lunch (and breakfast)  but not offered for dinner at all dim sum restaurants.  If you go there for dinner, you can order regular Cantonese dishes but not dim sum.

Hong Kong style cafes:
Actually Hong Kong style cafes are a mix of Chinese (especially Cantonese) food and Western food, where you can have coffee and noodles/rice together.

In the eastern side of SGV, there are 2 ""Delicious Food Corner"", one in Diamond Bar and one in Hacienda Heights, however, they are under different owners and with different menus.  Both are OK but the one in Diamond Bar is slightly more expensive.  If you go to the one in Hacienda Heights, you have to check out the crispy German style pork knuckle.

There are also 2 or 3 ""Delicious Food Corner"" in the Western side of SGV.  I think the one in Monterey Park is the same as the one in Diamond Bar.

Besides ""Delicious Food Corner"", there are still lots of choices.  There are Garden Caf√©, in Rowland Heights, Alhambra and Arcadia.  This chain has been in Los Angeles for more than 20 or even 30 years.

Or JJ Cafe in Monterey Park, opened in late 90s and still here, and food quality is stable.

Or EAT Bistro in Rosemead, I was there just last week.

Or U2 Caf√© in Alhambra.  

Or Bay Island Caf√© in Rosemead.  I have been there few months ago, the ""crystal chicken"" was delicious.

Or Tasty Choice in San Gabriel.

All of them have similar style of food, and usually have free refills for the drinks.

Northern Chinese food:
I really recommend ""Happy Duck"" in City of Industry for Peking Duck.  It's Taiwanese style Peking Duck, slightly different from those from ""real"" northern China, but I like it more.  I just been there for my last birthday.  Please make reservations before you go there.  The Duck must be reserved at least few hours ahead.

Besides this one, you can check out ""Bistro Na's"" in Rosemead .  It's Michelin rated!  Make sure to make a reservation before you go there.  I was there few months ago, food was very good and prices were very reasonable.

Taiwanese food.
I am not as familiar as Cantonese or Hong Kong style food,  but I have been to some.  First one is ""Mimi's 5 Bobee"" , there are branches in both Diamond Bar and Rowland Heights, but I have only been to the one in Diamond Bar for a few times.

Or Monja in City of Industry.

And there is a chain of Taiwanese style hotpot, the name of the chain is ""Boiling Point"", it has branches all over Greater LA, especially SGV.

Southwestern Chinese food.
Actually it's known as Sichuan or Chongqing style food, most are spicy, but we are from Hong Kong, we usually don't like too spicy food.  However, there are quite a lot of southwestern Chinese food in a mall called ""Hong Kong plaza"" (what an irony!).  The mall is on Colima Road in Rowland Heights, between Fullerton and Nogales and closer to Fullerton.  There are 4 or 5 restaurants offer southwestern Chinese food.

On the other side of the freeway, you can find some in the same strip mall of ""Happy Duck"", just opposite to Home Depot.

Besides Chinese food, I have a friend in San Fernando Valley also from El Salvador.  He took me to a place around North Hollywood, but I don't remember the name of the restaurant.

"Hello,
Wow! Thank you so much for taking the time to write me such a thorough response! Your recommendations are really helpful!

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know about the culinary nuances of the different regions in China. I just remember that I had a friend who invited me to eat dinner with his family at home. He had come from China not too long ago. They ate ‚Äòfamily style‚Äô where they had everything laid out on a big circle thing in the middle of the table that they could move around. Man, that was like the best meal that I‚Äôve ever had! There were all of these vegetables that I didn‚Äôt know even existed! I remember this one mushroom that really impressed me. My mouth is watering just thinking about it, hehe.

I guess I‚Äôm looking for authentic Chinese food places like that.

I‚Äôm Salvadoran, so our food & culture is different, but as an immigrant myself, I like learning from other ethnic groups.

I grew up in the SGV, but I was living in the Inland Empire for the past 14 years. I just moved back to the SGV; though, since I work here.

Maybe we could be friends & you can show me some legit food spots here? : )",t2_7oh8xnvx,David112587,0,1645928817.0,0,t1_hyleeei,hyleeei,False,David112587,t3_t1um98,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgv/comments/t1um98/food_place_recommendations/,Food Place Recommendations?,/r/sgv/comments/t1um98/food_place_recommendations/hyleeei/,3,r/sgv,0,3

"SGV is the Chinese Food mecca of LA, but not in Glendora.  The largest Chinese community is  Alhambra/Monterey Park/San Gabriel.  Second largest Chinese community is Rowland Heights/Diamond Bar/Walnut/Hacienda Heights.

What kind of Chinese food are you looking for ?  There are lots of different kinds of Chinese food.  Cantonese style, Hong Kong style western cafe, Northern style, Taiwanese style, Southwestern style (which is spicy Sichuan style) ....etc...   There are lots and lots of choices.  Please let me know what exactly that you are looking for so that I can make recommendations.  I am ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong, so I have been to lots of different Chinese restaurants in SGV.

&#x200B;

For Korean, there are also quite a lot of Koreans in SGV, especially Rowland Heights/Diamond Bar/Walnut/Hacienda Heights.  I used to go to ""BBQ Stop"" AYCE on Golden Springs of Diamond Bar.  Usually lots of people there.  In addition, there are quite a lot of Korean restaurant at that strip mall, just at the intersection of Golden Springs and Lemon Ave.  And there are quite a lot of Korean (and also Chinese) restaurants on Colima, especially between Azusa and Nogales.   


Besides BBQ Stop, you can try ""Baekjeong"" (on Gale Ave, near Fwy 60 Nogales exit) and ""Mister Bossam"" (On Colima Rd, near Fwy 60 Fullerton exit).  I have been to these places a few times before pandemic.  Very good.

&#x200B;

For Japanese food, I used to go to ""Man Sun Sushi"" in Diamond Bar (just few blocks from BBQ Stop), it is actually owned by Korean.  The set dinner was very good, just $100 can feed 3 to 4 people with lots of sashimi and sushi.  However, I have not been there since pandemic.  Some say the quality is lower and prices are higher now.

&#x200B;

For Vietnamese food, not very outstanding here in SGV.  Westminster/Garden Grove in OC have far better choices.  Actually not too far, just around 30 min of driving.  And Asian groceries there are cheaper than SGV in general.  Sometimes we go there on the weekend to have lunch and shopping for groceries.

&#x200B;

For Indian buffets, I have been to 3 different places in Diamond Bar.  Peacock, has been here for more than 20 years.  The other is Diamond Place, the third one is Curry India Bistro.  For me, all of them are very similar.

For Thai food, I have been to ""President Thai"" in Arcadia, I think that is quite famous there.  Maybe you can search from Yelp or Google.

For ramen, there was ""Foo Foo Tei"" in Hacienda Heights.  Close to ""7th Ave"" exit of Fwy 60.  I checked Yelp and still quite good ratings, but I have not been there for more than 10 years.

&#x200B;

2) Tony's Tacos (in Azusa) for standard tacos/burritos, or La Poblanita (in San Dimas) for breakfast burritos

3) Red Lantern (on Grand in Glendora) is solid but not like groundbreaking. There are a ton of really great asian food places in the SGV, especially in and around San Gabriel. I haven't tried a ton of them, but I really loved One One Dumplings.

"There is a paywall on the article, so here it is:

> What is currently an empty lot on Mission Boulevard in downtown Pomona is expected to give way to a four-story housing complex with 75 lofts, each of them subsidized to help renters with lower wages, according to developers of the project.
> 
> The Prisma Artist‚Äôs Lofts, located on 1.45 acres at 501 E. Mission Blvd., and featuring apartment homes in one-, two- and three-bedroom designs, will include 14 live/work units with ground-level storefronts. SVA Architects, along with development partners National CORE and Arteco Partners, are behind the project.
> 
> The development, in the final stages of planning and expected to be presented at a public hearing in February, will be geared toward local artists, similar to the Pomona Arts Colony located less than a mile away.
> 
> Rents are expected to be between $625 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and $1,784 for a three-bedroom unit.
> 
> Exact rental payments will be determined by the income level and number of persons per household, according to Anita Gutierrez, the city‚Äôs development services director. The project sets aside 15 units for those with extremely low incomes, 44 for those with very low incomes, and 15 for those with low incomes, as well as one unit for a manager, as required.
> 
> As one of the first developments to take shape in the area included in the Pomona Corridors Specific Plan, the Prisma complex has the potential to jumpstart similar projects, said Ernesto M. Vasquez, CEO of SVA Architects. The plan, which was adopted in 2014, covers areas along Garey and Holt avenues and Foothill and Mission boulevards.
> 
> ‚ÄúThis is kind of a corner gateway, like an entry to a district that the city sees as an opportunity to revive, especially pedestrian-wise, and activate this intersection,‚Äù Vasquez said. ‚ÄúThis is just the start.‚Äù
> 
> After more than three years of planning, Vasquez said, SVA Architects submitted a design to the city this month. The project‚Äôs vibrant design, exterior mural boards and open spaces reflect future tenants that will occupy the space, he said.
> 
> The Prisma building will offer public art, a courtyard with an outdoor barbecue, dining tables, landscaping, children‚Äôs play equipment and diagonal parking along South Palomares Street. There also will be potential space for a ground-level gallery for local artists to showcase work and other artist opportunities.
> 
> The project has a 24-month construction phase, with a tentative opening date of December 2024, according to Gutierrez.
> 
> The development is one of a handful in the city‚Äôs pipeline that look to bring more affordable housing and living spaces to the downtown area. This includes a 125-unit affordable housing project located at 1321 E. Holt Ave., a 57-unit development by Jamboree Housing at 508 W.

"I used to go to Dr. Jerry Johnson on Washington Blvd in Pasadena (maybe Altadena?).

He was very conservative about leaving teeth be unless they actually needed work (I had a dentist in DC quote me thousands of dollars of work and Dr Johnson basically told me ""I've been watching those teeth for years, you're fine""), reasonable quotes and AFAIK accepts most insurances.

2. Probably Pasadena/La Ca√±ada Flintridge is your best bet. There are lots of work from home jobs tho. Set your status and keywords correctly on LinkedIn and other job sites and headhunters will light you up. 

3. Not particularly. There are good and bad areas in practically every city. I would avoid most unincorperated areas. I also wouldn't choose to live in El Monty or Temple City but that's preference more than safety.

"Thanks for covering this! It's a very interesting story and I haven't had one since the pandemic started but now I'm craving one.

I enjoy your style of content! If I may offer one piece of constructive feedback, I do some work in audio engineering and it sounds like both of you are overmodulating on your microphones. I'm not sure what mics you're using or how they're hooked up, but when the amplitude of your voice passes a certain loudness threshold it's ""too loud"" for the mic to handle and it gets clipped, resulting in a very harsh sound.

Try reducing your mic gain and adding some dynamics processing/compression to smooth out the variance in volumes and then bring the whole level up to an acceptable loudness which should help alleviate that.

"From the article (emphasis THEIRS....wtf):

> Many Asian-Americans in the area voiced their outrage by pointing out they go out of their way to stay away from black people and now black people have brought their **‚Äúghetto culture‚Äù** upon Asians in the heart of the San Gabriel Valley.
> 
> One Monterey Park resident told Asian Dawn via phone interview, **‚ÄúI just mailed in my CCW application. We live in dangerous times. Biden‚Äôs America is a lawless America and we need to arm ourselves against the tyrannical horde. I fear for my parent‚Äôs safety as well. Every Asian needs to be strapped right now.‚Äù**

My friend is looking for a roommate! This sounds like something you might be interested in.

Edit: just realized that you have to be inside the Facebook group to see the listing so here‚Äôs the text:

Hi I am looking to rent out a one bedroom and one bathroom by July 1, 2021 or earlier to March 1, 2022.  After that we can discuss for a longer lease option. I prefer a Female roommate however, I am open to a male roommate as long as everyone is courteous and respectful of the space.  I do have a 45lb hound mix so all applicant needs to be dog friendly. My dog is house trained and very well behaved but I would prefer it that my roommates are comfortable with a medium size dog in the home since sometimes she will be at home while I‚Äôm at work. Because I am a busy person, I would also prefer someone who is busy with work or school and no longer in the partying stage, at least not at home. Company is welcomed, but please no parties at the apartment. 

This apartment is a 2-bedroom 2 bathroom apartment with 2 balconies. You will have balcony, living room and kitchen access as well as your own bathroom. There is an unit laundry and dryer so no more having carry your laundry down the stairs and or have strangers touching your laundry. Dishwasher and central AC is also included. Your room and bathroom will be unfurnished. The rest of the  apartment is already furnished. Utilities are not included in the rent and will be shared 50/50. The apartment comes with an assigned subterranean parking space, not tandem. It is gated and very secure.  

Area:
Great area close to everything! It is less than a 2 min walk to Cal Tech and PCC. And less than a 10 min drive to old town. Lake street is very close by and it is where you have all the shops and dinning that you could want. Nearby grocery stores include: Trader Joe‚Äôs, Pavilion, Ralph‚Äôs, Whole Foods. 

Neighbors:  The complex‚Äôs has great diversity. There is a mix of older as well as younger people living there. All the neighbors are very friendly  and respectful with one another so please do so as well. Pasadena is also a very safe and quiet place to be in while still having all the bars and up and coming restaurants nearby. You get the best of both worlds!

You will need to fill out an application so serious inquiries only.

"I would say, in general, that all the areas you list are safe.  If you last lived here in the 1980's or 1990's, a lot of areas that were 'bad' back then are actually solid now.

1. Monterey Park is dominantly Chinese, with other Asian populations.  Significant new development.  The area is clean.  Atlantic Blvd. has a lot of new development.
2. El Monte has a similar story.  The ""Valley Mall"" is still dominantly Latino, but the crime has steadily dropped for three decades, and Valley Blvd. is nicer.
3. Arcadia is dominantly Chinese, and very expensive.  School district is perfect.  It's ""Not Quite San Marino""
4. Monrovia has been on an upswing since at least 2000, when I moved there.  Myrtle Street is a model downtown area, and combines 'cute' with 'hip, slick, and cool'.  They are pursuing multiple-use buildings to keep the housing prices realistic.  The new developments are slick apartments that are cheap compared to living on the Westside.
5. Duarte is almost an upscale area, even those areas that 'are near El Monte'.  Without really knowing anything, I sense that they are trying to 'stay small', and don't have a lot of commercial development like Monrovia or San Gabriel.  Next-door Bradbury is a somewhat expensive 'secret little town' that is mostly more expensive foothill residences.
6. San Gabriel is great - I've lived there for almost five years now.  Lots of newer development, also very Chinese and Asian.  

Pasadena has small pockets of areas that are 'bad'.  The one I know best is West of Lake, north of the 210, I guess called 'Olive Heights'.  My experience in Washington Square isn't as bad, but you want to explore that area carefully before buying there - I would recommend a few late-night visits driving around.",t2_ghxga,CatOfGrey,0,1621366411.0,0,t1_gylv8kd,gylv8kd,True,smolbrowngirl_,t3_nfgp44,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgv/comments/nfgp44/safe_sgv_neighborhoods/,Safe SGV Neighborhoods?,/r/sgv/comments/nfgp44/safe_sgv_neighborhoods/gylv8kd/,23,r/sgv,0,23

"Most Chinese-American customers in SGV still aren‚Äôt returning to their pre-pandemic ways because they don‚Äôt feel safe. These huge restaurants that had sometimes hundreds of customers per day now only have very few customers. If there‚Äôs not a large population of Chinese people going back to dine-in, why should Chinese restaurant owners spend money to pay dishwashers, bussers, and food ‚Äúpresenters‚Äù to serve a very small customer base? A lot of customers prefer the disposable plates right now anyway. Of course, everyone will return to normal cutlery and plates very soon when more people feel comfortable. Unfortunately, a lot of menus have had to be adjusted too because of lack of demand. It costs a lot to buy those foods and have them prepared. It‚Äôs a waste of food and money if no one is actually ordering those items.

We‚Äôre not in normal times right now. Sure, maybe the quality or variety isn‚Äôt completely there yet for some restaurants, but we‚Äôre still in a literal pandemic. Chinese restaurants will do what they feel most comfortable with and reimplement more menu items and workers once they have the demand for it. I‚Äôll be happy to support the restaurants until then.

"This is kind of a silly question and title. Chinese food will never ‚Äúfall off‚Äù in the SGV. I know a lot of Chinese restaurants that are now open for dine-in.

Of course those kinds of restaurants will be more eager to open for dine-in than Chinese restaurants, who are known for amazing takeout systems established decades before this whole pandemic even happened.

"Hey all!

I posted a few weeks about my good friend's business. They're doing something really cool and I thought I'd share again (as there was a lot of interest last time).

In light of recent events of increased Asian hate and violence, Do House is [donating 50% of their proceeds](https://www.instagram.com/p/CM0Yhk9hl89/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) from all sales made from **now** until the **end of April** to AAPI organizations. First & foremost, their cookie do is awesome. But now you'll get to support the AAPI community with every pint purchased!

Do House is an Asian-American women-owned business that specializes in freshly made Cookie Do by the pint ready for you to take and bake. This provides convenience and ease without having to sacrifice freshness, quality, or taste. Each pint makes 12-16 cookies. They pride themselves on only using high-quality, real ingredients. They offer weekly pickups in Culver City & San Gabriel Valley area. They also do deliveries so feel free to DM/message them! The owner is super chill.

Please follow their IG to support below:

"I really like oinkmoo, for both milk and fruit teas! It's on the pricier side, but the quality of the teas is worth it imo. Same with bopomofo and motto tea! I would say both aren't really your classic tea spots though. I like that they have non-dairy milk alternatives (because I'm sensitive to dairy). 

I also like tastea for their fruit teas, but their QC is lacking haha. I always order my teas from there 25% sweet now because a lot of the times even at 25% sweet, it's still really/too sweet. And if it's not sweet enough, I'll just add sugar.

"Old post but in case you're looking for an answer, this sounds like a pretty old scam. 

They will approach you saying they found this jewelry on the floor and asks if its yours. Whether you say its yours or not they will insist they take it. They will let you take it, and they might even  walk away a little bit and let it sink in that you are now the owner of this jewelry. But then they return they will ask you if can give them some money for finding it. If you try to give you back they will just say they can't take it, but insist on getting a little cash instead. Some people might feel compelled to give them some decent money, after all its valuable gold jewelry that this finder was decent enough not to just pocket themselves right away right?

In reality they didn't find it but they have a bag full of it, and of course its not real gold.",t2_6w7ns,Jagermeister4,0,1614995003.0,0,t1_gpufv61,gpufv61,True,money_saver22,t3_lbuvpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgv/comments/lbuvpl/person_driving_in_parking_lot_waving_a_gold_ring/,Person driving in parking lot waving a gold ring.

"To Plug a Pension Gap, This City Rented Its Streets. To Itself.

Cities and states issued at least $6.1 billion in pension bonds last year. Novel ways to do so include renting property they already own under dummy corporations.

Facing a $1.2 million monthly bill from California‚Äôs retirement system, West Covina issued bonds through an entity that held the city‚Äôs streets as an asset.


The City of Tucson, Ariz., decided last year to pay rent on five golf courses and a zoo ‚Äî to itself. In California, West Covina agreed to pay rent on its own streets. And in Flagstaff, Ariz., a new lease agreement covers libraries, fire stations and even City Hall.

They are risky financial arrangements born of desperation, adopted to fulfill ballooning pension payments that the cities can no longer afford. Starved of cash by the pandemic, cities are essentially using their own property as collateral of sorts to raise money to pay for their workers‚Äô pensions.

It works like this: The city creates a dummy corporation to hold assets and then rents them. The corporation then issues bonds and sends the proceeds back to the city, which sends the cash to its pension fund to cover its shortfall. These bonds attract investors ‚Äî who are desperate for yield in a world of near-zero interest rates ‚Äî by offering a rate of return that‚Äôs slightly higher than similar financial assets. In turn, the pension fund invests the money raised by those bonds in other assets that are expected to generate a higher return over time.

If they can pull off the strategy, cities issuing these bonds can reduce their pension bills by an amount that‚Äôs the difference between what they earn and what they pay out. But as with any strategy based on long-term assumptions, there is risk.

Taxpayers can still owe the pension fund money if the investments don‚Äôt get the return they expect. And although most municipal debt is considered bulletproof because a government pledges to make its creditors whole in the event of a default, bonds like the ones West Covina issued don‚Äôt have that guarantee.

‚ÄúIt boggles my mind that anyone would buy these bonds,‚Äù said Jessica Shewmaker, who was a member of West Covina‚Äôs City Council when an investment banker pitched the idea last year as a way to cover a $1.2 million monthly bill from the California Public Employees‚Äô Retirement System, or CalPERS. ‚ÄúThese are streets that haven‚Äôt been paved in 20 years.‚Äù

Around the country, towns and cities are increasingly embracing more aggressive investment strategies as they struggle to cover funding gaps in their pension programs. The total public pension shortfall nationwide is about $4.7 trillion, according to Pension Tracker, a project of the Public Policy Program at Stanford University.

Many states have been trying to beef up their pension systems, which often means telling local governments to send in a lot more money. Few towns have cash just sitting around these days, but they can borrow it long term from investors, with maturities so far in the future that it feels like free cash. West Covina‚Äôs bonds, for instance, don‚Äôt need to be repaid for 24 years.

When a municipality borrows money for a public project, like a new road or bridge, it typically issues a general obligation bond, often after getting voter approval. These are the backbone of municipal finance, and come with robust guarantees ‚Äî courts can force borrowers to pay, even if it means raising taxes.

But it‚Äôs different when a municipality borrows to cover a pension shortfall. Usually, this is done with a pension obligation bond. These also require voter approval in some states, but typically come with fewer guarantees to their buyers.

It gets murkier when municipalities use West Covina‚Äôs approach. Because the bond is issued by the dummy corporation, it‚Äôs often called something else ‚Äî a ‚Äúlease revenue bond,‚Äù in West Covina‚Äôs case ‚Äî and doesn‚Äôt necessarily need voter approval.

The consequences of this approach became clear after Detroit declared bankruptcy in 2013 and couldn‚Äôt pay its creditors in full.

Like West Covina, Detroit had used dummy corporations to borrow money after it had been ordered to fund its pension. A few years later, in bankruptcy, Detroit tried to repudiate the $1.4 billion pension borrowing, calling it a sham transaction that used the dummy corporations to get around a legal debt limit. When the dust settled, the bondholders got about 14 cents on the dollar. The city‚Äôs retirees took haircuts, too.

The website of the 20,000-member Government Finance Officers Association, whose stated mission is to ‚Äúadvance excellence in public finance,‚Äù fairly screams: ‚ÄúState and local governments should not issue P.O.B.s.‚Äù

That hasn‚Äôt deterred governments. Nationwide, cities and states issued $6.1 billion in pension obligation bonds in 2020, more than in any year since 2008, according to data compiled by Municipal Market Analytics, a research firm. States with significant new pension borrowings last year included Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Michigan and Texas. In California, cities borrowed more than $3.7 billion to squirrel away at various public pension funds, breaking the old state record of $3.5 billion, set in 1994.

It‚Äôs a major comeback for this type of debt, said Matt Fabian, a partner at Municipal Market Analytics who has been writing about the deals for years. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre borrowing money and basically putting it into the market and gambling,‚Äù he said.

Mr. Fabian said his firm‚Äôs tally almost certainly missed the borrowing by municipalities that took West Covina‚Äôs approach, because those bonds used different names. Flagstaff rented its City Hall, libraries and fire stations last year to back a pension deal marketed as ‚Äúcertificates of participation.‚Äù In January, Tucson did the same, leasing two police helicopters, a zoo conservation center, five golf courses and the bleachers at its rodeo grounds, among other things. And a Chicago suburb, Berwyn, used ‚Äúconveyed tax securitization bonds‚Äù to help fund police pensions.

The street rent that West Covina, a onetime outpost of citrus growers some 20 miles east of Los Angeles now engulfed in sprawl, pays the dummy corporation is essentially the money to service the debt. By issuing that debt, the city was able to make a lump-sum payment of about $200 million to CalPERS.

Like many city pension plans that CalPERS manages, West Covina‚Äôs is only partly funded. CalPERS treats the shortfall of roughly $200 million as a loan it has made to West Covina, charging 7 percent interest. That‚Äôs an extraordinary rate in today‚Äôs environment, but CalPERS uses it because that‚Äôs the return that the pension system projects it will, on average, earn on its investments.

By paying off most of its ‚Äúloan‚Äù from CalPERS, West Covina doesn‚Äôt have to worry about the 7 percent interest, at least for now. The risk: If CalPERS misses its investment target, West Covina‚Äôs plan will be underfunded again, CalPERS will treat the shortfall as a new loan and the whole process will start over.

When West Covina considered its deal, the city‚Äôs investment banker, Brian Whitworth of Hilltop Securities, estimated that the city would pay 4 percent to borrow. Because CalPERS was shooting for 7 percent returns, he said, the city would save an estimated $45 million.

‚ÄúOn a bond around $200 million, it‚Äôs a pretty good savings,‚Äù he said.

No one demanded a projection of what might happen if CalPERS did not achieve 7 percent. Instead, Mayor Tony Wu grilled Mr. Whitworth on why he thought West Covina would have to pay 4 percent when El Monte, next door, was paying just 3.8 percent.

The proposal passed, 4 to 1, with Ms. Shewmaker voting against it because she considered the plan a gimmick to avoid putting the matter before voters, who she believed weren‚Äôt likely to approve a deal that would increase West Covina‚Äôs debt sixfold.

Mr. Wu, now a city councilman, said the city had to borrow, because it was locked into unsustainable pension plans and CalPERS refused to negotiate easier terms. The longtime owner of a mortgage-lending business, he said it was ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù for CalPERS to base everything on 7 percent when real interest rates were much lower. But he said challenging CalPERS would be a waste of time.

‚ÄúIt sounds very logical, but it‚Äôs not going to happen, because the ones who have power don‚Äôt want to lose it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre going to fight us big time. They‚Äôre going to sue us to hell. Their attorneys will go laughing to the bank.‚Äù",t2_bm2yx,The_Cat_Detector_Van,0,1613630447.0,0,t1_gnuzq7o,gnuzq7o,True,FrozenDrPepperBottle,t3_lma63k,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgv/comments/lma63k/west_covina_made_a_fake_company_that_rents_out/,"West Covina made a fake company, that rents out its streets, to pay for pensions.",/r/sgv/comments/lma63k/west_covina_made_a_fake_company_that_rents_out/gnuzq7o/,8,r/sgv,0,8

"I‚Äôm 46 and lived in El Monte in 84-85 and that summer I remember vividly. I remember the heat and that this was during the malathion spraying at night so everyone was told to shut their windows - if you didn‚Äôt have a/c that was extremely problematic. I remember a story on the news about ways to rig your house to alert you to invaders, and one suggestion was to put empty ice trays (they were still metal back then) along the window sill so if they fell on the floor due to someone trying to come in through an open window the noise would wake you up. I remember sweating in bed staring at the ice tray by my open window and not sleeping a wink for many nights that summer. Later in life I learned I had lived in many of the cities he murdered in. Watching him getting caught on tv and being beaten up by the neighborhood was enjoyable. I will never forget any of it. Oh, one more thing, I moved to Sierra Madre in 87 and my best friend had a story - she was home alone and the doorbell rang. She didn‚Äôt answer the door but looked through the peephole. She swears it was Richard Ramirez casing the area as her neighbor‚Äôs house was 666 Sierra Madre Blvd. That house now has a new address and has been rebuilt.

Realisically you're going to pay at least 325k for the lower end home in the lower end city you mentioned, which would be a 65k for a 20% downpayment.  Of course you'll need a little more saved than that. The bank is not going to let you use all your savings, they want to see that you have some extra money on top of that to be safe. And you also want to have room on haggling (for example you might be able to buy a home for 325k, but might need to afford to make that 330k initial offer before trying to haggling it down during the loan phase period)  

And that's for the lower end home.

"Disclaimer: I do think the r/personalfinance people have it right: buying a home is not an asset. Treat it like you're ""throwing away the money"", and paying for housing. If you like owning your own place, being able to paint it and remodel the way you like, taking responsibility for your own repairs, etc., it can be really rewarding. If you stay long enough, it can even be a good money move. But don't discount the upsides to renting: limited liability for repairs, making repairs and common spaces someone else's problem, and flexiblity of being able to pack up and move wherever you need to on short notice.

Once you're sure you want to buy, you should do some planning based on how long you're going to stay in the property. The longer you can commit to staying, the more long-term moves you can make to bring down your total cost of ownership. 

On the other hand, if it's reasonably likely that your career will take you somewhere else, or you're going to get tired of commuting, the more you want to optimize for short-term cost savings. (ARM loan, giving points in the loan to help with closing, etc.)

A safe rule of thumb is that you'll need your downpayment plus 2-3% of the cost of the home for closing costs and pre-payment of various things like insurance and property tax plus whatever you estimate you'll need in relocation costs. (movers, moving van rental, inspection fees, wire fees, escrow fees, major or minor renovation like carpet or paint) When we last moved,  we were in the luxurious position of putting 20% down, plus spending 3% in various renovations on top of what we got back in credits from the seller during the escrow process. We spent an additional 2 months paying for both our rental and the new place while we got the reno/repairs done. 

Set aside 1% of the house's price/year for repairs and maintenance. You won't spend it all every year, but it's a really nice cushion when you need to replace the roof or the HVAC system in year 3. 

We bought a condo as our first home. It worked out well. Do your due diligence on the HOA (google ""buying a condo"" and ""HOA reserves""), but some of the rules of thumb nationally (""condos appreciate less than single family homes"") don't really seem to apply here in Los Angeles. It was a very good way for us to build equity.

Some of the obvious levers:

* put less down. 10% is fine for a first home. You may need to submit a higher bid to be competitive. I got a lot of pressure from my realtor to put more than 20% down.
* shop around for a mortgage. Rates are still pretty close to all-time historic lows, but that also means there's more room to get a more or less competitive rate. As a first-time buyer, you may want to consider how easy the lender is to to work with. For me, having someone who did document submission electronically was a big win, so I took about 1/8th % hit in quoted mortgage rate for a broker who could Internet. YMMV.
* Sell points. Paying a higher interest rate means a higher monthly nut, but $80k means $60k take home, which might mean you could put up to $2.5k/month into your house payment, but you can save a lot on closing costs and get more equity into the house up-front.
* Pricing is all about where you're shopping. School districts matter a ton, so you may find a nice property in West Covina is much less than a run-down 800 sq footer in Diamond Bar just based on school district. You can get more house in a worse school district. This has an impact on your appreciation, too, of course, but if you're planning on staying a long time, appreciation is more of a roll of the dice-- these bedroom communities can get hot for reasons entirely out of your control.
* Realtors and mortgage brokers will approve you for way more than you can realistically afford. In Southern California, many people stretch their target to 4x or 5x their annual income, rather than the 3x that's typically recommended by /r/personalfinance and conservative financial planners. 
* Buy less house than you can afford. If you're going to live by yourself, don't take it upon yourself to furnish and air condition a 3-BR. 
* You could consider getting a 2- or 3-bedroom property and taking on roommates if you want to commit to more house. You'll need more financial reserves if you do this.
* Take the thirty year loan. 

Some other resources:

* try /r/FirstTimeHomeBuyer . Lots of great motivational stories and important gotchas.
* Pricing is available on Zillow or Redfin. Set the filters to what has sold recently in your desired feature set (square footage, property type), and compare that way. No one here is going to be enough of an expert on those specific towns to tell you what to buy without knowing your means.
* https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/how-much-house-can-i-afford/calculate-affordability I like this one, but they're all aggressive, in my opinion. The main thing I'm willing to compromise on is size of downpayment. Sure, PMI stinks, but saving 20% for a California-priced home just takes so long when you're also paying rent.

"Hong Kong Cafe-Alices Kitchen. Hong Kong Cafe on Garvey for the rice rolls and HK milk tea. 

Vietnamese Deli- Saigon Bakery. 

Dumplings-Umm right next door to 101 is You Kitchen.  For some You Kitchen might be too ‚Äúlight‚Äù. Qing Dao Bread Food has the best in the SGV imo. I also like the dumplings at Cindy‚Äôs Kitchen in Hacienda. Also Hui Tou Xiang and One One

Chinese BBQ ( change it to Cantonese BBQ)- I agree Ruby BBQ for roast pork and roast duck (if your timing is right the skin is still crisp). For char siu go outside of SGV and go to Needle and Pearl River Deli. 

Can‚Äôt comment on Indo, but it‚Äôs growing. 

Taiwanese- Dai Ho, Corner Beef Noodle House, Cindy‚Äôs Kitchen. Lu‚Äôs Garden and Huge Tree Pastry deserves a shout out. Ahgoo‚Äôs Kitchen if it‚Äôs still good. 

Vietnamese Noodle Soup-Pho Bo, Pho Ga, Hu Tieu, Bun Rieu, Bun Bo Hue, Vietnamese are the Kings of Noodle Soups so it‚Äôs hard to pick but since they pick Bun Bo Hue, suck it up and drive to Ngu Binh in Little Saigon. SGV Vietnamese noodle soups is more known for Northern style Pho, some pretty good Pho Ga and a good handful of Hu Tieu places. 

Dim Sum- a takeout spot? I guess that works in a pinch and will satisfy a itch. I would pick Sea Harbour as the best dim sum in SGV (SF is better for dim sum than the SGV)

Bakery- I agree I freakin love Jim‚Äôs Bakery. The egg tarts are the very best and better than any dim sum place. 

For XLB it depends on how thicc you like the skin to be. For DTF I actually like the non-XLB stuff! I like Shanghai Dumpling House and Little Shanghai for XLB.
