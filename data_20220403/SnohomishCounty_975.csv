"""The following is from the CWA:

EVERETT, Wash. (March 31, 2022) — After facing years of retaliation by senior management and poor working conditions including understaffing and unlivable wages, Verizon Wireless retail store workers near Seattle, Washington are voting on union representation in an official National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election. Voting officially began on Friday, March 25 when ballots were sent out to workers, and the votes will be counted on Friday, April 15. If Verizon Wireless workers vote in favor of forming a union, they will join hundreds of thousands of other telecommunications and customer service employees as members of the Communications Workers of America (CWA).

    Good morning, union kin! Our ballots are trickling in, and we are voting YES to joining with other @CWAUnion workers.

    Voting is open for a few weeks. Check back soon for updates on when the final count will be!

    — VZWUnion (@VzwUnion) March 29, 2022

Employed across two Verizon stores in Everett and Lynnwood, Wash., these workers are going up against labor laws that favor employers and aggressive anti-union tactics by the company. In fact, Verizon flew their in-house union-busting team to Seattle the day after workers publicly announced their organizing efforts and asked for voluntary recognition from Verizon on March 7.

Last week, 90% of Google Fiber retail workers in Kansas City voted to join CWA, resisting a similar union-busting campaign. As Verizon workers add to the growing labor momentum nationwide, especially amongst retail and hourly workers, and stand up against one of the most notorious anti-union U.S. companies, all eyes will be on this election and the sheer determination of these workers to organize.""",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1648824055.0,0,t1_i2zll4o,i2zll4o,True,EverettLeftist,t3_ttsa40,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/ttsa40/local_verizon_workers_fight_for_union_in_nlrb/,Local Verizon workers fight for union in NLRB election,/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/ttsa40/local_verizon_workers_fight_for_union_in_nlrb/i2zll4o/,3,r/SnohomishCounty,0,3

"I live In Everett, right up the street from your office, near Value Village and only a few days before the Covid diagnosis was announced too.

I was diagnosed w Multiple Myloma Cancers myself, (mine is bone cancer tagging up and down my entire vertebrae). It hurts and alters my emotions a lot.

I took it in stride. Two years down the road and I’ve taken hit after hit. Im feeling scared and have lost primal mobility. But I still walk around w my walker.

I have a Caregiver who has Chronic Social Anxiety which I have in spades as well.

We both work well together now. My Memory has taken a dive and so has my hearing. Yet, we laugh at the end of each day… I wouldn’t change her, for the world. 🌿

Altogether we laugh we cry and we learn so much about who is really paying attention and keeping their priorities; like not dying. 

Things like them “not wearing masks and we will talk at the doorway”- just escape me and send me into worry; even after discussions have been made often.

When we go out to my Oncology appointments, I look like a bug, I wear 
Proper masks (plural) eye protection and bring ample sanitary hygiene when needed.

I forget the looks from people- good and weird. But I will juggle this all w my sense of humor and my sense of progress as I push through these two issues.

I am not sure if there is anything in Marysville but Everett has a adult rec league and Underdog (mostly based in Seattle) I think had a league up in Everett too. I have had luck registering as a free agent and had some random team reach out to play with them in a league in Lynnwood. They were good but clicky so I didn’t play again. I did it again with Underdog and that was a lot more competitive and fun. It was based in Seattle and they will build teams of entirely free agents if they can too.

"See, generally, RCW 16.08 - Dogs  
  
It shall be lawful for any person who shall see any dog or dogs chasing, biting, injuring or killing any sheep, swine or other domestic animal, including poultry, belonging to such person, on any real property owned or leased by, or under the control of, such person, or on any public highway, to kill such dog or dogs, and it shall be the duty of the owner or keeper of any dog or dogs so found chasing, biting or injuring any domestic animal, including poultry, upon being notified of that fact by the owner of such domestic animals or poultry, to thereafter keep such dog or dogs in leash or confined upon the premises of the owner or keeper thereof, and in case any such owner or keeper of a dog or dogs shall fail or neglect to comply with the provisions of this section, it shall be lawful for the owner of such domestic animals or poultry to kill such dog or dogs found running at large. RCW 16.08.020.  
  
One may kill a vicious animal in the necessary defense of himself or the members of his household, or under circumstances which indicate danger that property will be injured or destroyed unless the aggressor is killed, but it seems that such killing is justified only when the animal is actually doing injury. . . . Every person has a natural right to defend and protect his animate property--as cattle, stock and fowls -- from injury or destruction by dogs, and in pursuance of that object may kill dogs engaged in doing injury to such animals owned by him; but there must exist an apparent necessity for such a course, and the destruction of the dog must be reasonably necessary under the circumstances. . . . The right to kill dogs, in order to protect inanimate property, is based upon the same considerations. Drolet v. Armstrong, 141 Wash. 654, 657 (Wash. 1927).  


**If one was to be taking their pet for a walk under your control and a dog/s attacks your domestic animal then this is covered as well in RCW 16.08.020 under ""other domestic animal"" includes your pet dog, cat, rabbit and so on.**

This PAWS post says if you have a problematic bat to call a wildlife refuge center (and has a list):

Certainly they are not going to do anything about deer; it is part of the wonder of living in the PNW and in more rural areas.

"If this is the first-ever reported incident for this dog then no animal control in the state would euthanize the dog.   Seriously.  Your expectation that AC would “kill it” is unrealistic, and it is never going to happen over this one incident.

You should confirm that AC has designated this dog as dangerous under this statue, which it sounds like they may have if AC ordered them to keep a muzzle on it and to keep it behind a fence:

https://snohomish.county.codes/SCC/9.10.030

If they have designated the dog as dangerous AND the dog is loose and without a muzzle, AC can confiscate the dog, charge the owners with a misdemeanor, and yes - potentially could euthanize the dog in the future.   But they cannot unless the dog is designated as dangerous AND the owners violate the terms of that statute.    So check to see if AC designated the dog as “dangerous” per that statute.  

If you feel the need for satisfaction and closure, take the dog’s owners to small claims court to recover all of the vet bills for your lost pup, and any injuries your husband sustained.

This country is at 60% vaxxed, and more people have died this year than last year.  The government and Fauci told you it would greatly reduce the spread, and you believed it. Still believe it. I hoped it would, it hasn’t. What it does do is mitigate the symptoms so if you have it and you are vaccinated you are less likely to end up in the hospital and overwhelm the medical community. 

Now think about this for a minute: A whole bunch of vaccinated people that we know can still spread it, but now don’t have hardly any of the symptoms that they would have before.

"If you believe that you are protected by the vaccine, then you should not be scared of unvaccinated people.  

If you are in the presence of someone that's unvaccinated, and the vaccine protects you, then there should be no level of concern at all, right?

Or...maybe you don't trust in the efficacy enough to think you're safe?

But it's really more than that.  

See, the worse that could happen for unvaccinated people is that they die.  The vaccinated people don't want a vaccinated people to die, they want them to comply.  Get in line, step and fetch, because there's only one way to live, right?  The vaccinated way or the highway.

I mean, you're not concerned that all the companies that offer vaccines have an indemnity clause that prevents them from being sued, obviously.  

For reference, I where an N95 mask on the advice of top industrial hygienists who's very job is to create safe workplace and factory environments.  I do this because I spend all day going in and out of stores and restaurants, making deliveries.  I don't wear silly fashionable masks that do nothing to protect you, or flimsy surgical masks.  If I'm going to be forced to wear a mask, at least I'm going to wear one that is recommended.

On top of that, there are government hypocrites that tell others to wear masks, yet do not wear ones that they would ascribe others to wear.  Gavin Newsom, Lori Lightfoot, and others who follow the ""do as I say, not as I do""  principle of governance.  Those that lead, should lead by example,. 

But what do I know, other than I've been working the entire pandemic, bringing goods and supplies to those that stayed home.  

If it wasn't for people like me, your online orders would never be shipped, your restaurant orders would not be brought to you, your groceries would still be at the grocery store, and your prescriptions would still be at the pharmacy.

"Hello!  We moved from Loveland to Snohomish about 5 years ago...  (My side of the family is still in CO.)

As others have mentioned, both Mukilteo & Edmonds have very good schools and a nice feel to them.  The problem for you will be even with $800k it's going to be hard to find a house that's surrounded by trees or with a larger yard.  They are fairly pricey for Snohomish County.  And they are suburbia (but nice suburbia).  You're likely still going to be dealing with the neighbor's yippy dog.

We love Snohomish and I'd recommend it, but with your specific situation I'd actually focus on Arlington.  

* Solid schools.  I find it hard to wade through opinions and get a really good, subjective measures on schools, but Arlington's state report card is generally higher than neighboring Marysville or Mt Vernon to the north.
* Easier access to Camano than Everett, Snohomish, Lake Stevens or just about anywhere else.  Stanwood would be the easiest access but you're probably going to be disappointed with your restaurant selection there....  It's a relatively small town compared to your other choices.
* $800k will have a better chance of getting you the house you want in Arlington compared to other choices as well - large lot, next to some sort of greenspace, big enough for your family.

"Northwest Everett Neighborhood checks most of your boxes. While you're not going to get a major lot of land covered by privacy trees, the neighborhood is great. A lot of younger Millennial Families have been moving into the area. The elementary school is one of the better ones in Everett and the PTA is so involved they are able to raise funds to pay for additional staff members.

You'll have easy access to North I-5 to Camano and easy access off I-5 south to Everett via the Marysville flats. Honestly, that's ideal, because you avoid the HWY 2 congestion.

The neighborhood ends at the North at Legion Park, which has awesome views, play grounds, and is home to the Everett Arboretum. The south part of the Neighborhood (19th street), is where Grand Avenue Park is. A stunning strip a long a bluff overlooking the Sound, Navy Base, and the Everett Waterfront Development, which there is a brand new foot bridge that takes pedestrians down the marina. The Marina/Waterfront is $550M development that already has a new Hotel, Apartments, and much more retail on it's way. Woods Coffee has signed a lease, and Lazy Boy Brewery is moving from South Everett to this location. There's a Distillery, Scuttlebutts' restaurant,  Lombardi's, Anthony's, and more to come. This is all walkable from the neighborhood.

For internet, most of us have access to Ziply Fiber, so 1 gig is easy to come by for a great price.

While it is still considered ""suburbia"", the homes range from the 1910's to the 1970s, so the cookie cutter thing won't happen. The area is flat, which makes walking, jogging, or biking really great. The nice part too, is we're only 2 miles from Downtown Everett, which has been going through a lot of clean up. Great restaurants, coffee houses, tap rooms, farmers market, and a fantastic Children's Museum that's undergoing a massive addition.

I always thought little of Everett, because of its reputation. There's still some areas that are a little rough, but there is huge potential, and great value. I personally moved from Downtown Edmonds to NW Everett, because I saw soooo much value and potential. I don't regret it, it's a great neighborhood.",t2_5rj4cg8t,FrontButtPunt,0,1637339979.0,0,t1_hl9tfe4,hl9tfe4,True,scienceizfake,t3_qxhxy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/qxhxy7/if_you_could_live_anywhere_in_snohomish_county/,If you could live anywhere in Snohomish County…,/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/qxhxy7/if_you_could_live_anywhere_in_snohomish_county/hl9tfe4/,4,r/SnohomishCounty,0,4

"Personally I would give them at least a week and then kindly ask them what's up.  They are probably pretty shaken up and deciding the best course.  The insurance company might want to pick it up, or they are trying to figure out another solution to get some money out of it since this whole situation might cost them some.

Since you have a retention pond I am assuming you have an HOA and while parking in front of it is an HOA violation, I don't think it's anything the city will care too much about unless it's a fire lane.  I have seen abandoned cars ticketed in Everett that it took months before they towed it away and they where on the street.

I wouldn't go to the HOA either unless it's been there for months.  Thing is if you go to the HOA they will know it was you.  I got a complaint from a neighbor that we had gravel on our driveway for more than 72 hours(she complained at hour 73).  Despite the fact that we where out there moving the gravel to the backyard every day and the pile was almost gone.  So I went to the next meeting and mentioned all of their violations.  They had to take down their basketball hoop, repaint their trim AND remove their whole fence because the HOA said no chain-link fencing.  Their petty complaint cost them thousands of dollars.

"If you expect to work from home and your husband streams, then you need to have adequate upload speed.

Comcast aka Xfinity hides the upload speed of their 1200 Mbps plan which is their advertised download speed.

The 1200 Mbps plan has a ""up to"" 35 Mbps upload speed which is going to be a struggle if you plan to video conference and have your husband stream at the same time.

Edit: my recommendation

I haven't had Xfinity since I moved onto fiber. But I previously used a CM1000 with Xfinity and didn't have any issues.

For their 1200 Mbps service, it seems you need to stronger CM2000

"Short version:  mold from leaks is the landlord's responsibility.   Mold from condensation is the tenant's responsibility.   Regardless . . if you have already exhausted the AG's office and the DOH mold guidance stuff and the Landlord/Tenant association resources for this ...  WHY ARE YOU STAYING??  


Because the answer is:  yes, you likely need to hire an attorney to represent your family's interests, which should be:  getting the landlord to compensate you for the costs of moving to a new, safer, mold-free residence.   


The landlord does not care about the health of you or your family, period.  They have said as much.   They want you out and they don't care about the mold.       


You can spend your time and energy trying to get a lawyer (and the law) to force the landlord to fix the mold problem which will take a LOT of time and money during which you'll all be suffering, at the end of which you'll likely have a very shoddily addressed mold remediation AND a landlord who hates you and cannot wait to evict you or raise your rent exorbitantly the moment they legally can, OR:   


You can spend SOME time, money,  and energy getting a lawyer to negotiate with the landlord for some amount of money to compensate you for the costs of moving somewhere else so you never have to deal with them or their mold again.   


OR you can just bail as quickly as you can find other housing, which is most definitely the cheapest and fastest option.   


You might try posting this on /legaladvice, for reference.

"I had a similar situation happen in an apartment and I can sympathize with the nightmare you and your family are going through. There aren't any real laws in regards to mold. During our situation, I called the public health department, the EPA, and many other organizations and went in circles without getting much help. The only thing I could do was hire a private mold company to show proof and find that there was serious water damage. You will have to see if you can find the source of the mold like a leak or something. If you can locate that, then the landlord will be forced to make a repair. If they don't do it in a timely manner (30 days) you can move out without penalties. You can call a building inspector to help assess the situation to determine how the mold is happening. Look up your tenant rights in regards to repairs and habitable living situations. There are tenant lawyers who can help you if your landlord continues to refuse to do the right thing.

"\\\* Edit - I just realized this post is a few weeks old. Sorry. I'm leaving my response up just in case it is still helpful.

State law limits the documentation fee that dealers charge to $150. Most charge the maximum.

Sales tax varies by location, and there is an additional 0.3% tax as part of the state DOT funding. Generally it will be 9-10%.  If you buy at a dealer, you will pay the local rate at the dealer location. If you buy private party, you will typically pay the local rate at your home address. You can look up local rates here:

[https://webgis.dor.wa.gov/taxratelookup/SalesTax.aspx](https://webgis.dor.wa.gov/taxratelookup/SalesTax.aspx)

Registration also varies by location. The areas served by bus or planned to be served in the future by light rail have transit fees incorporated into car registrations that are often hundreds of dollars per year.

The dealer is required by law to show you the final price (I think broken down by category) before insisting you sign the sales contract.",t2_zy16m,iamlucky13,0,1627082203.0,0,t1_h6b1qw0,h6b1qw0,True,in_iam,t3_ob7o8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/ob7o8n/how_much_is_the_car_registration_documentation/,How much is the car registration + documentation fee in Snohomish County?,/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/ob7o8n/how_much_is_the_car_registration_documentation/h6b1qw0/,1,r/SnohomishCounty,0,1

"Reading through the county pet laws, it looks like you have to register all dogs with the county, have enclosed spaces for any livestock, and not commit animal abuse/neglect/have a dangerous dog (further restrictions apply to dangerous dogs).

I will note that animal hoarding can be considered a form of animal neglect/abuse. This only comes up if the animals don’t have enough space for their number (40 cats in a small apartment or house, even if indoor/outdoor, for example) or are not being properly cared for (lack of clean/poop free places to poop, inconsistent feeding, lack of medical care despite a clear need, etc.)

If there’s something in particular you want to do, please double check state law. There also may be distinctions between “agriculture/registered” and “private/personal use” (certain reptiles can only be owned by a zoo/someone with keeper licenses, for example).

"Mukilteo is definitely the best option of the two. It is an extremely safe area, you are 10-15 min away from I-5 and I-405. It’s quiet and very suburban. Contrary to what the commented above states, mukilteo has a QFC grocery store, and a Safeway. And ferry traffic is not horrible, large line on the weekends but really doesn’t add much traffic to the speedway. My favorite part of mukilteo is the central location it sits in, with no traffic, you are half an hour from the big cities south (Seattle and bellevue). And you are a half hour from the big cities north (Marysville) it makes things very accessible both north and south. The Paine field airport is close, but they are infrequent and not as intrusive as SeaTac. And the Elliot is not directly under the flight path so you would not hear much. 

Silver lake has a lot more traffic and is much grittier. If you want a city vibe, silver lake is that.

"I-405 north of ~ Bothell is a huge bottleneck for traffic; there’s a wetland so it drops from ~5 lanes to 2 despite still being heavily used and there’s no plans (or space) to expand it. 

I’d suggest going east or south (though Bellevue would also create some sticker shock). Issaquah, Carnation/Fall City are all fairly nice. Issaquah is a bigger city, while Monroe, Duvall, Carnation, etc are very much small towns. The metropolitan sprawl is starting to crash into them though, as commuting from further out is the only option a lot of people have to the housing rates here.

There’s also historic bias toward the northern cities because of redlining... and I-5 has express lanes that switch to meet commute patterns if you live north of Seattle (like Lynnwood). Trying to go east/west during rush hour is pretty horrific here though. Bridges over water and other bottlenecks (like the trestle on highway 2 into Snohomish) are major pains too.

Today the traffic especially on the trestle is getting to its old “glory” in which you quickly can lose lots of time, I’m lucky in both ways I do turn of in the lesser traffic after the Trestle, mornings West heading north on I5, east I turn of on to Snohomish. But i pass the left lane traffic at half point, because it’s usually at standstill. Also the hill from Frontier Village as well as to it is a big slow down. my Emphasis was on the give or take, if traffic flows, you might make it in 50 mins to an hour, but you’ve to many  parts in which traffic can and will be very slow, that can cost you lots of time. Traffic in “locked down” COVID country for sure was a breeze, I’m an essential worker, so I never was on lock down, but man traffic is slowly but surely coming back to it’s pretty COVID ”glory”. The trestle so far has cost me 10 mins on travel time, because of people’s inability to either merge into traffic or maintain/ reach posted speed. Especially those right lane clowns, who have to come almost to a stand still, in order to merge at the very last moment on to the left lane to continue their travel, where they’ve should been to begin with.",t2_86i412l8,RedPorscheKilla,0,1618737507.0,0,t1_guyaw9m,guyaw9m,False,OffGridVenture,t3_mrq2au,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/mrq2au/commute_time_estimate_help_for_a_teacher_in/,"Commute time estimate help for a teacher in Everett looking to buy a house in Granite Falls, thanks in advance!",/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/mrq2au/commute_time_estimate_help_for_a_teacher_in/guyaw9m/,1,r/SnohomishCounty,0,1

"""""EVERETT— After weeks of passionate discussion, the Everett City Council has approved a law that will criminalize sitting or lying on streets and sidewalks in a 10-block area east of Broadway near downtown.

The council passed the “no-sit, no-lie” ordinance by a 5-1 vote Wednesday night. Enforcement will not begin until alternative housing is available at a “pallet shelter” village approved by the council last month.

The no-sit, no-lie boundary will stretch from 41st Street to Pacific Avenue near I-5, including Everett Station and the Everett Gospel Mission. Dozens of people live on the sidewalks and in alleys adjacent to Smith Avenue, an area business owners and officials said has borne the brunt of Everett’s homelessness crisis.

The ordinance also requires a permit from the city to provide food, goods, supplies or services in the zone.""""",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1616203862.0,0,t1_grjp81c,grjp81c,True,EverettLeftist,t3_m8wdym,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/m8wdym/everett_city_council_passes_no_sit_no_lie_law_in/,"Everett City Council passes ‘no sit, no lie’ law in 5-1 vote",/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/m8wdym/everett_city_council_passes_no_sit_no_lie_law_in/grjp81c/,5,r/SnohomishCounty,0,5

"Upvote for the recommendations for anywhere in the Bothell or Mill Creek area. Mill Creek downtown in particular will have some people in your demographic, and is in a good spot for commuting into Everett, whether by highway or by back roads. Downtown Bothell is a bit farther South, but is seeing some great growth, and will have a nice mix of social and natural environment.

I'd not recommend going any farther South than Bothell/Kenmore. While Redmond, Kirkland, and Woodinville are nice areas, you are paying a huge premium for proximity to the big tech employers in Redmond, Kirkland, and Bellevue. Their downtowns are nice enough, but they're basically just a couple city block worth of restaurants. Given you're not commuting into Redmond, you can do better for less money.

$120k is plenty to live comfortably as a single person in this area. It helps that we have no state income tax, so you get to keep a lot of that money.

"I'm for the legalization of drugs, but this article and others I've seen don't really make it clear what Marysville or the state did.

Previously, most jurisdiction had strict liability possession laws, which means ""those aren't my drugs, I don't know how they got there"" is not a valid defense to the crime.

The state supreme court said that was unconstitutional and that inadvertent possession has to be an allowable defense.

Marysville made their own law, but it says you are guilty only if you ""knowingly"" possess drugs. I'm not a legal expert, but I would guess this is likely constitutional. Furthermore, I am expecting most jurisdictions will be getting similar kinds of laws if the state doesn't pass something similar first.

The articles I've read are really unclear and make it seem like Marysville is acting against the State Supreme Court, which they likely aren't, or that this wasn't inevitable in the current drug-hostile climate, which it likely was.

"""MARYSVILLE — Drug possession is illegal once again, at least in Marysville.

The City Council voted on Monday to adopt an ordinance that makes it a gross misdemeanor to possess a controlled substance without a prescription.

The council passed the ordinance because there currently is no state law regarding simple drug possession. In February, five state Supreme Court justices ruled the state statute was unconstitutional because it didn’t require prosecutors to prove someone knowingly, intentionally possessed drugs.

As a result, local authorities can no longer arrest someone on a felony charge solely because the person has a few grams of heroin, meth, cocaine or other illicit drugs — unless there is suspicion that the individual intended to deliver the drugs, according to the Snohomish County Prosecutor’s Office.

The decision left attorneys and law enforcement officers scrambling to deal with the fallout. The Legislature could create a new law, but that appears unlikely during the session that is underway through April 25. Two bills have been introduced into the state Senate’s Law and Justice Committee. Both say that a person must knowingly possess drugs to be considered a felony. And one adds that unknowing possession would be a civil infraction with a fine up to $3,000.

At least one Snohomish County leader is exploring whether the county could establish an ordinance similar to the one passed in Marysville.

County Councilman Nate Nehring said he’s waiting for further information from staff about whether it’s an option for the County Council and what the process would entail.

"How can local businesses refuse service if there's no mask mandate? Same goes for ""no shirt, no shoes, no service."" That's not unconstitutional, so why is a mask mandate? 

I agree that in an ideal world, we as individuals shouldn't be compelled to do anything, but I don't think we should live in a world without consequences. If you don't wear a mask, you run the risk of infecting someone else - because masks don't protect you, they protect me from you. Why shouldn't there be enforced consequences for you, then, if you hurt or kill someone by not wearing a mask?

"""UPDATE, 2:30 p.m. Monday: A recall petition against Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney is dead. The campaign needed to turn in 45,000 signatures by the end of business Tuesday. They filed a motion for reconsideration of the deadline, citing the challenges of collecting signatures during the pandemic. That request was denied by Snohomish County Judge Jennifer Langbehn. She said the campaign should have filed their request with the governor or the state of Washington.  The group says they do not have enough signatures to put the measure before voters. The two main issues were Fortney’s refusal to enforce the governor’s stay-at-home orders and his reinstatement of three deputies who were fired by his predecessor.""

Edit 3/9/21:

A lot of people are making a big deal about the mask mandate which is a very small part of why Fortney was being recalled. He is a deeply corrupt 
sheriff who does not believe in accountability for officers who lie to cover their asses or who shoot people that are surrendering. The Sheriff office.under Fortney is a gang that protects its own:

He rehired two Brady deputies who were fired for illegal search of a vehicle who lied to the previous SnoCo Sheriff to cover it up:

He rehired another deputy who was fired for shooting a man who was surrendering after a car chase:

Fortney is deeply corrupt and does not believe in police accountability.

Using local fish helps maintain the genetic diversity of steelhead in the Skykomish, state Department of Fish and Wildlife project coordinator Jim Scott said.

A draft environmental assessment for the hatchery is available for public comment through March 8.

“A lot of times the local people have more knowledge about an area,” National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fish biologist Emi Melton said. “We do a public comment period to make sure we didn’t miss anything.”

The hatchery is intended to boost numbers for steelhead in the Skykomish.

"""EVERETT — Snohomish County Councilman Sam Low on Wednesday voted against an Everett activists’ appointment to a local law and justice advisory group, citing her “anti-police” posts to social media.

During a virtual council meeting, Low questioned Luisana Hernandez about whether she was referring to Everett police officers when she used the words “oppressors” and “ignorant racists” in comments published on her Facebook page last fall.

His four colleagues voted in favor of Hernandez’ appointment to the county’s Regional Law and Justice Council, an advisory body that helps address problems related to the justice system.

“I am not here today to attack Ms. Hernandez’ character, but I do have a right as a council member to do my due diligence in this appointment process,” said Low, who has been a vocal supporter of local law enforcement as activists have raised concerns about police brutality and misconduct. “Placing someone on this commission that might feel like abolishing police is the answer — that wouldn’t be fair to the candidate or to the Law and Justice Council.”

Specifically, he asked her about a September post, in which she criticized Everett Mayor Cassie Franklin for supporting the city’s police officers.

In a subsequent comment on the post, Hernandez said she “will not be thankful for a woman in office that tows the line for oppressors.”""",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1614307601.0,0,t1_gosbm9x,gosbm9x,True,EverettLeftist,t3_lsnwy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/lsnwy2/low_opposes_activists_appointment_to_justice/,Low opposes activist’s appointment to justice advisory group,/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/lsnwy2/low_opposes_activists_appointment_to_justice/gosbm9x/,7,r/SnohomishCounty,0,7

"""Large-scale public works projects rarely come in on schedule and under budget, thanks to unexpected costs and complications.

So, no, few were likely shocked by the news, first reported by The Herald in January, that the expected price tag for ST3 — Sound Transit’s extension of its light rail system to connect Snohomish, King and Pierce counties — had grown by an estimated $11.5 billion, forcing the system’s three-county board of public officials to begin considering ways to economize, delay projects, find additional sources of funding or devise a mix of all three options.

Events don’t come much more unforeseen than pandemics, and covid-19’s impacts on the region’s economy and its hit to tax revenue for the project account for a little more than half of the shortfall. The rest is the result of rising property values making land acquisition for the line and stations more expensive, in addition to construction site challenges and requests for project upgrades.

What that means for Snohomish County and Everett — the farthest point north on the “spine” originally envisioned to connect it with Seattle and Tacoma — is that Link light rail’s arrival here could be pushed out even further than the expected date of 2036.

And that could be the least of the sacrifices.

Sound Transit is hiring a consultant to review cost and revenue projections and other factors as its staff and officials begin work to address the shortfall, with public review expected in April and board decisions by July on how ST3 plans will change.

Snohomish County’s Sound Transit board members, three of the 18 on the panel, in a recent conversation with The Herald Editorial Board, said they recognize the need to adapt to current budget constraints, yet there remains concern — fed by past struggles to recognize Everett’s place in completing the regional system first proposed in the mid-1990s — that the county and Everett could again be left to shoulder most of the burden in accepting changes.

Finishing that spine for a regional system has to be the priority, said Snohomish Count Executive Dave Somers, who represents the county alongside Everett City Council member Paul Roberts and Lynnwood Mayor Nicola Smith.

“One of my concerns is that parts of the system that are farther out on the schedule could get short-changed again,” Somers said. “We don’t need a King County-centric system; we need to tie the region together.”

Smith, who is watching with the rest of Lynnwood as columns for elevated sections of the line are now rising near her city, agrees. Lynnwood’s City Center, part of ST2’s slate of projects, is on schedule to see light rail service by 2024. More than the promise of clean and efficient transit, the project also has been part of what has spurred transit-oriented residential and commercial development in Lynnwood.

“We’ve had 1,000 (residential units) built in the last two years,” she said.

But the connection to Lynnwood isn’t enough on its own.

“That’s going to bring a lot of positive changes; we know that. But it won’t be complete for the whole system if we can’t get to Everett and Paine Field,” Smith said.

Two possible cuts to ST3 are major concerns for Somers, Smith and Roberts. One would eliminate Everett’s Sounder rail service, which connects Everett Station to Seattle. The other proposal would eliminate Link’s connection to the manufacturing jobs center at Paine Field, instead skipping it and its thousands of workers as it makes its way north.

The Sounder rail service is necessary for serving commuters between now and 2036, Somers said. “And not going out to our job center, to me, is a no-go,” Somers said.

Instead, Somers and Roberts have said previously, they are open to phasing in parts of the line, completing the line near Paine Field before its arrival at Everett Station. Previously, when local officials backed the 2016 vote on ST3, they insisted on reaching all of Everett at the same time.

“We’re going to be open to looking at how to rearrange things,” Somers said. “But I’m not interested in chopping out our projects to pay for somebody else’s bells and whistles.”

The “bells and whistles” include projects proposed in Seattle to build portions of lines and stations underground and capping a landfill near Kent for construction of a maintenance center.

Service to and from Paine Field, Roberts said, the largest manufacturing base in the state, must be preserved. Again, it’s about the jobs — and the commuters — there.

“Paine Field makes sense for the very reasons we decided to build the Sound Transit system,” Roberts said. “Once you get north of 128th, there isn’t much in the way of population on the east side of I-5; there’s a ravine and a river.”

In addition to the common sense of sending a transit system where the commuters are, there are issues of climate change and socio-economic equity that Sound Transit’s board must consider.

“We need to ensure that ST3’s investments are spread equitably along the line and not merely benefiting only the wealthiest parts of our region,” Smith said. “Equity has to be a key part of any realignment decisions.”

Along with reducing traffic congestion on I-5, I-405 and other regional highways, the intention of building light rail, Roberts said, has been to get people out of their single-occupancy vehicles and into a clean and efficient transit system.

“The way to de-carbonize your transportation system is to build a system that goes where people are,” Roberts said. “It’s not more complicated than that.”

Snohomish County’s local representatives on the Sound Transit board say their fellow board members are receptive to their concerns, even as they work on their own communities’ needs. Supporters of Seattle-oriented add-ons to the Link system may now be more open to finding separate funding for certain projects. One group, calling itself Seattle Subway is proposing new tax revenue sources — affecting Seattle’s residents only — that could offset the costs of some Seattle upgrades.

Communities within the Sound Transit district — which connects the three counties’ population centers — and the 18 elected officials they represent will need to focus their attention again on why the system is being built: a spine that connects the three counties, north to south, and moves commuters from their homes to jobs, schools and their everyday lives. That spine will deliver that service equitably and with the best opportunity to limit greenhouse gases from our region’s transportation system.

And ensuring that spine gets built will mean Sound Transit’s board members may need to show some backbone.

">I’m not sure you actually want to have an honest conversation after that but here goes.

Way to poison the well. Of course the conversation is now tainted because *you* implied, with no evidence, that I didn't want to have an honest conversation. If I didnt want to have a conversation then why am I wasting my time replying to you? Or is it that I said something you didnt like so its easier to dismiss as being ""not honest"" than actually confront the idea and do some critical thinking. Sorry, but your mind reading abilities suck.

> I fall in the camp that more housing if any kind is good even if it is icky McMansions.

Excuse me? How do 1.5 mil mcmansions count as ""more housing"" in anything but the strictest definition? You cannot be saying that a completely inaccesible property to most people is more housing. Maybe more housing to the 1%? 

>but many it is lack of knowledge that they can. Yes, mind blowing.

This is just proving what Im trying to tell you, that landlords and the practice of realty investment as a whole have so distorted our society that many people do not even see a path to a housing system that is anything but exploitative.

>Now to your idiot point that landlords basically shouldn’t exist.

Perjorative and ad-hom. Very cool.

>If less didn’t exist at the extreme all tenants would become homeless.

I legitimately don't know what you're trying to say here. Are you saying without landlords then the people that rent would all be homeless? How would that work? They wouldn't just, have the homes that they already have been paying for? You said it yourself,

>""30 years from now you own the home and the tenant bought it.""

How about instead of giving the home to the landlord we just say, I dont know, gave the home to the tenant? Theres already homes around, do you think I just want people to own empty homes because renting them out is bad? No, people should own their own home because renting out other people's homes is bad.

>Presumably your reply will be “okay fine they can have apartment buildings but not houses.” To which I would say then only homeowners can live in houses? Seems pretty classist to me.

That is spectacular. Really. As if people don't *ALREADY* own their apartments? This goes back to your point of people not understanding that they can really own their own home instead of renting. How do you not know that its an option for people to own their apartments? 

And if your position is that landlords provide convenience Id argue that the convenience is only there because we're used to it being this way. Without landlords we'd be more flexible around home ownership, first time buyers wouldn't be competing with some rich ass buying up his 10th rental.

What I was trying to reference with ""land speculation"" was the entire practice of real estate investment and owning large amounts of land to profit off those that reside there. Generally making something that people can't go without into an artificially high priced commodity in service of financial conquest, is bad actually.

>30 years from now you own the home and the tenant bought it. 

Jesus you just give up the game there, huh? Mask off.

Maybe the tenant should just, oh I dont know, *own* the home? This is why home prices are so god damn high, people are trying to get others to buy them a home theyre not going to live in. The entire profession is immoral and abhorrent to any feeling human.

"I feel compelled to ask since you have ""seattle"" in your name - do you mostly work around urban areas? 

Snohomish county has TONS of land that is bought and developed into multi-million dollar mcmansions. That is a prime example of land speculation driving up housing prices. You can certainly speculate on land by simply buying and holding but its a waste if you have the capital to develop it. 

Buying a residential property to rent out is similarly a land speculation - but used to not only speculate on the land itself but to take advantage of whoever needs to live on the land.

"Regarding “it’s mostly investors,” can you cite a source? 

My anecdotal experience has been the opposite: that the vast majority of buyers and closed sales after escalation clauses are occupants, and even more so in cities/neighborhoods where the average price is below 2x the county median.

(The stereotypical Asian investor or empty-occupant is looking at $2+ million houses in West Bellevue, not $800k houses in Lynnwood. Moreover, they’re rare. As far as I’ve seen, the housing demand and appreciation is from local tech employees, recent tech transplants, and long-term Seattle residents whose equity market investments have appreciated. There’s a ton of all 3 categories.)

"OLYMPIA — An effort began Tuesday to let Arlington and Marysville continue offering new manufacturing businesses a tax break if they create high-paying jobs in the Cascade Industrial Center.

“It is critical now more than ever,” Marysville Mayor Jon Nehring told lawmakers at a hearing on a bill to extend and expand the tax break set to expire next year. “This is where the job growth in Snohomish County will be coming.”

Nehring appeared virtually in front of the House Finance Committee which is considering House Bill 1386 sponsored by Rep. Emily Wicks, D-Everett. Arlington Mayor Barb Tolbert and Snohomish County Council Chairwoman Stephanie Wright also testified in support of the legislation.

No one testified against the bill which is scheduled to be voted on by the panel Thursday.",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1613680524.0,0,t1_gnxf0y9,gnxf0y9,True,EverettLeftist,t3_lmwibm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/lmwibm/arlington_marysville_push_state_to_extend_key_tax/,"Arlington, Marysville push state to extend key tax break",/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/lmwibm/arlington_marysville_push_state_to_extend_key_tax/gnxf0y9/,2,r/SnohomishCounty,0,2

here's what I meant to also share with the image\~\~

If you'd like to share YOUR perspective...  
I'm gathering input on what you consider your most important concerns with respect to WA wildlife and the climate.

I developed a survey to help inform our local nonprofits of where their focus should be. When I reached out, they promised to take the issues that you all deem most important to the Capitol and advocate on them. Kinda blew me away, but here we are.

Please share with family and friends. The survey is 18 questions. Shouldn't take 7 minutes -max. Well, YOU might. Who's to say? Prove me wrong.

Jokes aside, if you take the time to share, I'll make sure the local nonprofits listen.

"From the FAQ:



1.) Why are we working to recall Snohomish County Sheriff Adam Fortney?


       
 A.) He has refused to enforce the “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” mandate issued by Governor Inslee

        
B.) He has encouraged the public to defy the “Stay Home, Stay Healthy” mandate

        
C.) He reinstated 3 deputies who were previously fired for cause, including killing an unarmed citizen, costing the taxpayers over $1M in restitution to the family. Two of the rehired deputies were found guilty of lying and can therefore not fulfill their duties to testify in court as a credible witness. Since being rehired, all 3 deputies have engaged in more unacceptable conduct:

   
D.) One lawsuit involved Fortney, Wallin, Boice and others for tasing and having a police dog bite a handcuffed man, 

  
E.) Another lawsuit involves Wallin violating the department's use-of-force policy by releasing a police dog on (and seriously injuring) a man without sufficient cause.



2.) Why were the deputies he reinstated fired?


       
 A.) Deputy Art Wallin was fired in October 2019 for shooting and killing an unarmed 24-year-old man. Taxpayers paid $1million to the family of the victim.

       
 B.) Deputies Boice and Twedt were fired for lying while on the job, and also for conducting an improper and illegal search (because they were fired for lying while serving as deputies they are not considered reliable witnesses in court).",t2_4xy2n3eq,EverettLeftist,0,1612215634.0,0,t1_glnjf0q,glnjf0q,True,EverettLeftist,t3_la9aeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/la9aeg/lets_recall_sheriff_adam_fortney/,Let's Recall Sheriff Adam Fortney,/r/SnohomishCounty/comments/la9aeg/lets_recall_sheriff_adam_fortney/glnjf0q/,9,r/SnohomishCounty,0,9
