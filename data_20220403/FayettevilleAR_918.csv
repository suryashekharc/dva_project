"**Top Picks in Dickson Street Area**

Vetro 1925 - I like the pork chop.

Leveret Lounge - Haven't been there but I've heard good things

Hugo's - I get some kind of specialty burger, apple pie is good, mom gets crepes cannelloni

Doe's - Good steak house

Atlas - A family friend bought a condo right next to this place and couldn't stop talking about it (before they moved there). Haven't been there before but the people who were obsessed with it have likely been to many nice places. I think Atlas might be expensive...

**Dickson St. Honorable  Mentions**: Theo's is pretty good. Emelia's & Prelude are popular for brunch. Both are dece but not mind blowing.

**Not Dickson Street Area**: Meiji (sushi), Bocca (Italian), Joe's (Italian), Shogun (Hibachi with a nice view of the town on the patio), Wright's BBQ - Not a big BBQ guy myself but their brisket is amazing. Be prepared to wait.

Most of these are on the $40ish+ end except for Hugo's and maybe Wright's. Guess it depends on what you get though.

Skip Bordino's.

"Due to unforeseen limitations with how Google Sheets handles large quantities of data, I will no longer be tracking/posting county-specific data for Arkansas. I have been combatting separate issues for months with repeated changes to ADH data reporting structure, but this new issue would basically require me to redesign the way I log data and how the website interfaces with it from scratch (again). Now that we are at the point where the CDC is beginning to guide people into the transition from living in a pandemic to living with an endemic COVID, I feel that it is an appropriate time to stop collecting and publishing county-level data.

I don't feel that we're quite at the point where it is appropriate to stop tracking/posting altogether, so I will continue to post on r/Arkansas for the time being, as well as on Facebook (ARCOVID19info) and Twitter (ARCOVID19info). I will also continue updating the state-level info and graphs, as well as sending daily email updates.

Stay safe!

They didn't have a webcam option for us but are very active on social media and were very kind and welcoming at pick up and drop off. The building is nice and clean.

They are fairly particular about shots though so you need to be up to date. They require canine influenza vaccine, which I'd never heard (and I am pretty good about keeping my dog up to speed).

"Bee Vee's in West Fork is excellent. There is also a flea market on the way from Springdale toward Tontitown that has cool stuff, the name escapes me though.

Recently one called ""Pirate's Cove"" opened in Springdale and it was enormous but pretty fun to prowl around. They even have a little cafe, I didn't try it though.

"Hi! I'm excited for you. I currently live in South Fayetteville and work in Bentonville. I live closer to Mount Kessler which I love for biking/hiking but I would love to be living in the Southeast part of Fayetteville if not right in the middle of downtown. I'm in my early 30's with no kids, btw. 

It sounds like your ideal location might be East of College, South of North Street, and North of MLK. Walkable, young professionals, young families, adjacent to the nightlife of Dickson Street, without all the noise. 

West Fayetteville is full of suburban sprawl, strip malls, college students & apartment buildings. South Fayetteville has plenty of charming attributes but isn't as walkable as any of us would like and has a few factories that give it more of an industrial feel than I'd prefer to look at as often as I do. North Fayetteville is where I go to shop and fight through busy traffic. South Central & South East are where it's at.

"Bridgeport. There are lots of great neighborhoods around town (the only ones you’d want to avoid are the college-age rental areas) but I do think the Wilson Park area would be a perfect place to look at. 

Just so you can get a vibe: north and west Fayetteville are newer developments with bigger houses, that’s where you’ll find more chain/franchise places. South Fayetteville is the less desirable area but which is rapidly gentrifying. East Fayetteville has some super nice cozy neighborhoods but it’s not very walkable. Central Fayetteville is walkable and has a mix of super expensive (think $1M+) houses, older mid-level houses, and fairly affordable apartments and student housing.",t2_5cbimd11,ggildner,0,1642787593.0,0,t1_htmk3p4,htmk3p4,False,Unlucky_Wolverine_44,t3_s9fftu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FayettevilleAr/comments/s9fftu/neighborhoods_in_fayetteville/,Neighborhoods in Fayetteville,/r/FayettevilleAr/comments/s9fftu/neighborhoods_in_fayetteville/htmk3p4/,2,r/FayettevilleAr,0,2

"You’ll likely be happiest in downtown Fayetteville, especially in the Wilson Park area (or really anywhere close to Ozark Natural Foods, Dickson St, and Block St). Even not considering the nightlife, there are plenty of great local restaurants, coffeeshops, groceries, and retail shops that are walkable.

My wife and I live on the edge of Fayetteville in a very nice neighborhood that we love, but you won’t really be able to walk to everywhere you need unless you’re downtown.

Welcome to Fayetteville, it’s a great place. We lived abroad for several years before ending up here, and it was a great decision for us. Fayetteville is the perfect blend of small town and cool vibes.",t2_5cbimd11,ggildner,0,1642786532.0,0,t1_htmh678,htmh678,True,Unlucky_Wolverine_44,t3_s9fftu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FayettevilleAr/comments/s9fftu/neighborhoods_in_fayetteville/,Neighborhoods in Fayetteville,/r/FayettevilleAr/comments/s9fftu/neighborhoods_in_fayetteville/htmh678/,3,r/FayettevilleAr,0,3

"There are a lot of flavors of nerd so I'll hit a couple of my favorites. You mentioned some of your areas of interest but just in case.

On the off chance that you're a book nerd may I recommend the Dickson Street Bookstore and Rock Bottom Books.  The former makes national list of amazing hole in the wall bookstores and the latter is a great hole in the wall comic book store. I've been going to both places since I was a kid and they are still owned and operated by the same people.

If you're an anime nerd I can't promise they always have the best sales or the most complete selection but The Geek Realms as another locally owned and operated joint that has everything from anime to board games.

 If you're a video game nerd you cannot go wrong with Arcadia because it's a flat rate pay to play and again locally owned and operated.

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

"Unfortunately /u/PeaceLoveSmithWesson is part of the problem that plagues Reddit. Powerful mods who push their own agenda and routinely ban those that disagree with them. I've also seen numerous occurrences Mr. Peace insulting others before banning them. Which is certainly odd considering his [stance here](https://www.reddit.com/r/EatCheapAndHealthy/comments/pbrbv4/we_call_upon_reddit_to_take_action_against_the/hafba46/?context=3). It's frustrating to see a mod with such a fragile ego take it out on other users. I believe part of Reddit's content policy is to ""Remember the human"". I just don't see him doing that day-to-day.

On one hand, stopping COVID misinformation is important. I'm double vaxxed and currently doing my best to keep others save during this COVID wave. But making a small city sub go private isn't exactly impactful. His comments here have also taken a holier-than-thou approach to them. Which tracks given his record on the food subs he dominates.

Left is communism, government control of policies and resources, etc. If you’re running into lots of people begging to have the government control all resources and hand them out evenly, point me that direction. What you’re thinking is more politically central, while half of America leans heavily to the right. In fact, the most left leaning people you can find here still want most aspects of capitalism, but with a few checks to rein it in. That makes them still right of center, politically.

His personality was very cat like. Didn’t really give a shit if you were around. If he was hungry would go kill more chickens. We tried so many different dog food types and styles but did not care. Very apathetic dog. I think a farmer eventually got him because we could not keep him contained or stimulated enough.

There are also about 8 (maybe more) private schools in the area, including Montessori, Catholic, and non-denominational Christian, and a fairly active homeschool community.  

If your home is within Washington County, you can get a library card for the Fayetteville public library.  (We’ve has cards for both Springdale and Fayetteville at the same time.).

"Lindsey and Associates is the biggest local realtor. We’ve worked with them before and been happy with them.  ReMax also has a presence in Northwest Arkansas. Despite Covid, the housing market is quite robust here, so there seems to be no shortage of real estate agents. 

For entertainment in the area (in non-virus years), the Walton Arts Center usually brings in a variety of plays, musicals, the symphony and smaller-venue concerts and the like.  We’ve taken our kids to see a screening of ET, the Blue Man Group has appeared, and they’ve done Elf and A Christmas Story musicals.  In Rogers they have the Arkansas Music Pavilion for outdoor concerts.  Since you have kids, there is a children’s museum in Bentonville.  It’s worth getting a membership.  I like to take my kids there to burn off energy, and if I go at least twice a year, that more than covers the price of a family membership. 

Food-wise I recommend Marley’s Pizza in Fayetteville off campus (off Dickson street) and Mj’s Pizza off Elm Springs Road in Springdale.  Springdale is kind of known for Taquerias.  I like El Cuñado, personally.  If you like Froed Chicken, AQ chicken is the local favorite (the lemon pepper over the coals is good there).  For Catfish I like Catfish Hole.

Fayetteville is nice, but so are the cities along the bypass to the north. I've lived in Fayetteville for 15 years, and have kids. it's a nice city, but I'm sure we'd be equally happy elsewhere in NWA. 

as for where to say that isn't a hotel, I haven't tried any, but there are airbnb options, many of which are under $100/night. as for things to do, Arkansas is the natural state, and there are lots of places to hike, camp, and fish. there is also a nice bike trail that runs through six towns: https://www.nwatrails.org/trail/razorback-regional-greenway/

There was a study done at the university of Harvard saying that the removal of cops would add 900 more black deaths per year with a margin of error of 30. I think that those 9 deaths are a problem I just don’t think that multiplying the death rate by 100 is the solution. Studies show when there are more cops less crime is committed particularly in majority black neighborhoods. This saves more black lives. I think breaking up police unions making it easier to fire bad cops which is literally a republican stance,t2_5nmfwatq,tprice61,0,1593095408.0,0,t1_fvyh3t4,fvyh3t4,False,[deleted],t3_guxr3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FayettevilleAr/comments/guxr3s/new_graffiti_on_college_ave_hell_yeah/,New graffiti on College ave.

Well congratulations you managed to say a lot while also saying absolutely nothing. Red lining has nothing to do with what pipes were allowed by the city. The city of flint has also been run by primarily black people for even before the allowance of led pipes so again I’m not seeing.  how that’s a race thing. To clarify my earlier statement according to the WSJ 9 ya armed black people were killed last year. Only 3 of those 9 were not resisting. I’m a big fan of blood chokes considering they have no long term damage and can easily take control of someone and make them comply bc they’re unconscious. So that being said I have a problem with all 9. But since there a 375 million interactions a year and only 9 unarmed deaths were looking at a 0.0000024% problem. To suggest that all the police precincts across the country are targeting black people is based on nothing. So far nothing major has changed so don’t get your hopes up. All we’ve gotten so far is Democrats kneeling in racist kinte cloths rather than actually proposing policies. I think the solution is more police. I think a situation is much less likely to go south when there are more guys there. Examples we have on record is the fact that more cops equals less resistance while simultaneously having less force being applied. And the reason I say there is no systemic racism is because nothing in the system is targeting black people. Therefore by definition the system can not be racist unless you point out where the system is doing something like that @wu-dao,t2_5nmfwatq,tprice61,0,1593092122.0,0,t1_fvybadc,fvybadc,True,[deleted],t3_guxr3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FayettevilleAr/comments/guxr3s/new_graffiti_on_college_ave_hell_yeah/,New graffiti on College ave.

Red lining has been outlawed for decades in 2019 there were 9 unarmed black people killed only 3 of which who were not actively fighting the police. You can also look up and see that white people are killed more often by police per interaction.

"this would have been a good topic for mod mail, but since it's here, why not discuss it openly. your original post was very light on details, but that is understandable. [I commented on it](https://old.reddit.com/r/FayettevilleAr/comments/bycqzk/some_people_in_fayetteville_arent_even_human/eqh5m6k/), and noted that it wasn't a very useful post (but I did not ask you to remove it, nor did I remove it). it boiled down to, bad things sometimes happen to good people who do nothing wrong. Not a super useful post, and not really topical, beyond the fact of where the alleged incident occurred. 

I say alleged incident, because we only have one side of the story, and it's not even your story, it is your friend's story. While I feel awful for anyone who is assaulted, including your friend, having a third party post about it probably isn't helpful for anyone but you. You are willing to name the the people who (allegedly) assaulted your friend, but will you name your friend as well? Is there a reason your friend isn't posting this information in a far more public place?  Is there a reason the police dropped the investigation? 

looking at your scant reddit presence, this account is either an alt, or you are mostly a lurker or light reddit-user. I don't doubt people are drugged and assaulted in Fayetteville. I don't doubt some victims are denied justice. but a random month-old account with virtually no substantive participation isn't going to do much to help.
