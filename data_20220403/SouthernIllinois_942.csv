"Robert Davenport at ReMax/Realty Central is a good realtor in Carbondale. But I think maybe you should pick a city first, or work with a different agent in each place. I doubt you’ll find someone who could effectively cover both places as crazy as the market is right now.

"I recommend considering Murphysboro! I lived in Carbondale for the last seven years, since moving back to the region, and gun violence had become a regular occurrence in the neighborhood I was living in (Forest x W. Walnut.)   


I bought a house in Murphysboro, and got it for a steal. I love walking my dogs all around town and looking at all the old architecture. Many Murphysboro neighborhoods still have character, compared to the neighborhoods in Carbondale that I could afford living in, that have become shells of their former selves due to slum lords.   


Murphy has a nice specialty coffee shop, and super cool plant/home goods boutique. The downtown is being revitalized, so it will continue to improve with amenities. Also, Murphysboro is walkable, while Carbondale is much less so.   


Another benefit is Murphy is the last ""larger"" town on the way to St. Louis/Cape/Missouri, so it's quicker to get to those places.   


If not Murphysboro, I'd recommend south of Carbondale (Makanda area,) north of Carbondale (Desoto,) and if you're considering east of Carbondale, I wouldn't recommend anything further than Cambria. If you venture further that way, it's gonna get whiter, more conservative, and more expensive.",t2_chdv3wz,girlgangvocals_,0,1648391312.0,0,t1_i2bes3w,i2bes3w,True,HellStandsStill,t3_sxuwjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernillinois/comments/sxuwjn/moving_in_june_looking_for_advice/,"Moving in June, Looking for Advice",/r/southernillinois/comments/sxuwjn/moving_in_june_looking_for_advice/i2bes3w/,2,r/southernillinois,0,2

"Carbondale has really gone downhill in the past 5 years. Many of the stores are closing, the demographics are shifting there and covid really seems to have hit Carbondale's economy hard I think. Marion is nicer in general and better for shopping. I travel all over Southern Illinois for work and live near Vandalia. I'd stay away from Mt Vernon, Centralia, or even Danville due to crime and gang issues in those towns. Most people are moving out of Illinois but Marion seems pretty stable right now and would be near the top of my list. Taxes are very high in Illinois so across the border in KY or MO is a good idea. You also won't want to consider Cairo, it hasn't gotten better since 2000. I think Nashville and Pinckneyville are nice for smaller towns. Carmi and Salem aren't too bad overall. I live out in the country away from town so that might be a good choice if you like privacy. Property prices are less in smaller towns but farm and is really going up in Illinois. Edwardsville and Glen Carbon near St Louis are nice but you might as well live in Missouri at that point.

"When I grew up in Harrisburg in the 1970s during elementary school I didn’t feel it so much. But then my family moved us to Eldorado and I could feel such tension. In Harrisburg my best friends were black. 

I couldn’t handle it and moved out of the area. I was afraid to bring home my 2 husbands because they were not white.

"I grew up in Harrisburg and Eldorado. 2 of my brothers and myself went I to the Navy. I felt suffocated living in the area growing up. Mind you my friends were black in Harrisburg and Eldorado is a Sundown town. This was the 1980s and not sure if that law changed. Even though SoIL is in Illinois there are many to this day hung up on civil war shot and hang out rebel flags. Which piss me off. I was in the Navy and rebels or Civil war were traitors against our army and country. There are many racists that live in the area. Carbondale is a school town so it is a bit different. Just keep this in mind. Oh and if you lan on having kids…just know the public school system from k-12th is at the bottom for the state. I didn’t learn how to write a paper till I went to college.

I’m a second year student at a CC in OC and I just got accepted into CSUN for a bachelors in rad science: radiography. But today I also just got accepted to Southern Illinois University - SIU for a bachelors in rad science: rad therapy. 

I love where I live right now. My family is here and the farthest I have to travel is 25 miles 1 way to Pomona for my volunteer work. There’s lots of food in OC and everything I need, it’s right here. 

If I go to CSUN and move to the valley, I can still have all that OC offers on weekends when I visit home, yet I get to explore the valley and LA when I want to, and that’s the more exciting part. I know it’ll be a bit expensive living in Northridge but I know it’ll be worth it for being so near to LA and all the fun things there. If anything, I’ll be on Pell grant and Cal grant so those help too. However, it’s gonna take me another 3.5 years before I graduate and work as an Xray tech. 

If I go to SIU, I’ll be like a fish out of water. Southern Illinois is a rural place so there won’t be much happening there. And when I did my research, the crime rate around SIU is super high and I’m just scared for my safety. I will still have to pay a lot as an out of state student, Pell yes but no Cal grant. However, their bachelors is 3 years and when I work as a rad therapist, I make more than just an Xray tech. Google Xray tech salary vs radiation therapist salary in Ca and you’ll see the difference.

I still can do radiation therapy in Ca but with 1 additional schooling with City of Hope - the only rad therapy school in SoCal. So if my end goal is to work as a rad therapist, Csun + City of Hope will take me 4.5 years (bachelors + cert), or SIU for 3 years (bachelors). But SoCal is home and it’s safer (I believe) than southern Illinois.

So what do you think I should do? I’m already 30 and this will be my first time having this college experience (for the past 2 years I’ve been doing school Covid-style so I never left the comfort of my room, let alone house for school)

“It could be a difficult crossing. The Mississippi River spanned more than a mile between the French village at Kaskaskia, in present-day Illinois, and St. Genevieve, now part of Missouri. For much of the 1750s, the Reverend Father Alexandre Xavier de Guyenne, curé of Kaskaskia, frequently traveled between Catholic parishes on opposite banks of the Mississippi. Four parishes operated on the east bank of the river, and a new one had just opened on the west bank. But the parish in St. Genevieve had no priest, and so the Jesuit superior of the Kaskaskia mission tended to its members, instructing residents in the pillars of the faith, as well as ""visiting the sick and in relieving the poor."" As he went to and fro, he trusted his fate to a ""slave, who alone guided the canoe."" The crossing was no simple undertaking. The current would challenge even seasoned rowers, and the wind gusts brought ""danger of perishing, if in the middle of the river"" the canoe ""had been overtaken by a violent storm."" Despite the challenges, a sense of mission brought Father Guyenne back and forth across the Mississippi. But what motivated the unnamed slave to keep returning time and again between the banks of the river and not trying to head off to freedom?”",t2_7nthltu8,Substantial-Welder51,0,1645158275.0,0,t1_hxemyaf,hxemyaf,True,DylonNotNylon,t3_ssiw0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernillinois/comments/ssiw0s/books_about_our_area/,Books about our area,/r/southernillinois/comments/ssiw0s/books_about_our_area/hxemyaf/,1,r/southernillinois,0,1

This was incredibly helpful and thanks for the detailed explanation. I only asked because I’ve always thought of the Illinois regions in more of a “black and white” type of way. I don’t know why but in my mind southern Illinois always started just south of I-70 and continued to get stronger the further south while northern Illinois always started at some arbitrary line around the Bloomington/Peoria area.

"Roads and area codes can sometimes be useful to help sketch out the dividing lines of what might be considered historically ""ethno-graphic"" (for want of a better term) regions which existed in the past and persist in some forms in certain areas, but you are correct there is an awful lot of blending that has been going on during the ~350 years Europeans and others have been coming to Illinois (obviously, the Shawnee and other native tribes were always here first). 

The more useful guide would be to think in geographic terms because the limits of both travel and communication were dictated by geography much more than today when we can blast tunnels through rock for roads (or just fly) and call each other on phones over the air. 

When the country was being settled geography dictated to a very great extent where people could travel and settle and conduct some form of commerce to build up and develop an actual functioning community connected to the rest of the country. 

Mainly, rivers provided the easiest form of movement and communication, and so people basically followed the rivers and their tributaries, founding communities along their banks. And to find out where the people who settled Southern Illinois came from the simplest way is to follow the rivers that lead here back upstream, as these were the main arteries pumping people from the East to Southern Illinois. The Ohio River brought people from the Alleghenies in Pennsylvania and the Shenandoah/Blue Ridge in Virginia, while the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers brought people from the Carolinas across Kentucky and Tennessee. It is this pattern of settlement that makes Southern Illinois more culturally similar to Kentucky or Tennessee than the rest of Illinois, which the user above me outlined as well: they came by the Great Lakes. 

Speaking of which, the earliest settlement of the Illinois country was in Southern Illinois but not from migrations coming up rivers from the East, but rather down from Canada through the Great Lakes, portaging to the Illinois River and sailing to the Mississippi. The oldest town in Illinois is [Prairie du Rocher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prairie_du_Rocher,_Illinois) which was founded by the French coming down the Mississippi. And even today there are still families from that early settlement living here, one gentleman with the exquisitely stereotypical French surname *Du Clos* was kind enough to share with me a family bible passed down from the 1700s.

Anyway, if you were to use the main rivers and their tributaries as guides for where these settlers went I would not be surprised if you found people descended from Appalachian settlers all the way up the Little Wabash River as far north as Effingham, certainly all the way up the Big Muddy River to it's headwaters near Mt. Vernon. 

To put it in visual terms, if you were to imagine the South as a heat-map, with rivers bringing that ""Southern heat"" (hehehe) to southern Illinois, the heat would start to dissipate north of an area between Rt.13 and Rt. 14., weaken significantly near the I-64 corridor, and peter out completely by the time you get north of I-70.

"A lot of it has to do with the Civil War. This area was really divided from the rest of Illinois bc, as was mentioned,  most of our people came up from Kentucky and Tennessee,  etc . A lot of those folks sided with the Confederacy. Families were split down the middle, one brother joining the Confederacy,  another brother choosing the Union. It was a wild time back then. 

I know from my point of view, (41F, born and bread here), we were taught we were technically south of the Mason-Dixon line. My dad's side of the family grew up dirt poor coal miners in Creal Springs. Shot squirrels out of necessity to eat, grew HUGE gardens, canned and ate fresh food they grew themselves. We have some of the best soil in SO ILL to grow anything in.  And my Grandmother was a terrific shot with her shotgun, she said words like ""warsh"" for ""wash"", ""tumped over"" instead of "" turned, or dumped over), used Southern colloquial sayings and phrases,  made the best cornbread and fried chicken you'd ever eat, and ended up with 11 kids. My dad moved to Chicago when I was five and thru visiting him was when I learned I had a southern accents. 😱 I was shocked, bc I didn't consider mine to be as pronounced as those in the very very isolated communities here. I agree with the person who said Mt Vernon is VERY different culturally than the rest of SO ILL. I'd definitely say anywhere south of there that's still in Illinois,  you can find a person with a twang in their cadence, who probably loves to two-step, smokes Marlboro Reds, tells you he's gonna ""warsh the dishes "", and looooves 17th Street Bbq!",t2_o74i4,SherlockLady,0,1644988576.0,0,t1_hx4y5f3,hx4y5f3,True,lilbizzness36,t3_sterta,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernillinois/comments/sterta/why_do_the_people_in_southern_illinois_act_and/,Why do the people in southern Illinois act and talk like they are from the South?,/r/southernillinois/comments/sterta/why_do_the_people_in_southern_illinois_act_and/hx4y5f3/,2,r/southernillinois,0,2

"Parts of Southern Illinois are just as rural and poor as Arkansas, West Virginia, and so many other places you associate with ""rural"" and ""poor."" The area over on the Ohio River, Rosiclaire, Elizabethtown, Cave in Rock, the Garden of the Gods area--I've been in that area a few times, you can't even get cell phone service half the time, they are that far off the grid. Areas like Grand Tower and Ware on the Mississippi River side. Cairo where the rivers meet. These places don't even feel like Illinois, because they have more in common with Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas. Why do they talk that way? Isolation, poverty, and poor school systems. Places with no significant industry. These places still have a substantial number of people doing subsistence farming. Many of then are living on welfare. For generations they've lived on the same plot of land, and they either have no desire, or no means, to move to somewhere with better fortunes. And many times they idolize the South. These are the people who take tremendous pride in being called ""rednecks,"" the more redneck, the better, so they make no effort to correct their speech; drawling is a matter of pride to them.",t2_ajtss,BrundleBee,1,1644964625.0,0,t1_hx3hwxs,hx3hwxs,True,lilbizzness36,t3_sterta,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernillinois/comments/sterta/why_do_the_people_in_southern_illinois_act_and/,Why do the people in southern Illinois act and talk like they are from the South?,/r/southernillinois/comments/sterta/why_do_the_people_in_southern_illinois_act_and/hx3hwxs/,3,r/southernillinois,0,3
"I'm not a historian but I have read a fair amount of Illinois history and my understanding is it has a lot to do with the manner in which Illinois was settled. Southern Illinois was settled far earlier than northern Illinois/Chicago, and the people that settled here came largely from either the east - Kentucky and Tennessee, who in turn came from Virginia and the Carolinas, which are largely ""southern"" in culture - and the south by way of the Mississippi - Arkansas, Mississippi  and Louisiana. The northern portions of Illinois were also settled from the east, but mostly via the Great Lakes and trade thereon, meaning early residents would have come to Chicago from New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio.

St. Louis was a larger town than Chicago until after 1870, and southern Illinois was very influential in the state until well after 1900. The Dixie-south influences in southern Illinois are due to the region being historically populated by people who were culturally more similar to Southerners than to the people who eventually populated northern Illinois, and I think that similarity and subsequent affinity continue to this day.",t2_7b7na,unclefes,0,1644964106.0,0,t1_hx3gm12,hx3gm12,True,lilbizzness36,t3_sterta,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernillinois/comments/sterta/why_do_the_people_in_southern_illinois_act_and/,Why do the people in southern Illinois act and talk like they are from the South?,/r/southernillinois/comments/sterta/why_do_the_people_in_southern_illinois_act_and/hx3gm12/,58,r/southernillinois,0,58
"Because historically we are. My family has lived in Pope County for generations. They migrated from eastern KY prior to that. We’ve all lived on basically the same road since. Why shouldn’t my accent reflect that? Why would I talk any different?

It also depends on what you call SoIL. Mt Vernon is culturally different than Harrisburg. My point really only applies to areas south of Rt13.

"As someone who does gig work after my full time job, I agree with this. The only thing I can argue is if you do it right and follow hotspots, event traffic, plane arrivals,  and work within the busy times - you can make a good chunk. $150 for 5 hours is what I’d call a good night of doordashing. But with that 5 hours there’s an hour break inbetween when it slows down, I spend just shy of $10 in gas usually, and you gotta think of the ware and tear in the vehicle.

"I returned the area for a visit this past May and I cannot express how confused I was with how legalization was handled. I expected that crossing the border to Illinois would be like what I remember crossing into Missouri was like when I was a kid. Everyone knew fireworks were illegal in Illinois and legal in Missouri. If you didn't know, the huge signs made it clear. I foolishly expected something similar. I'm in Tennessee now. It's about as illegal here as it could be, but every gas station has a sign saying that they sell Delta 8. Buying felt like getting a mammogram in an airport security line.

"My information isn't all that current. and I know some of it can't still be the case.

The Old Brick sewer system under salem at one time allowed you to travel from the bottom of the hill on north broadway to the Brown shoe factory, and there were larger square ...rooms..near AND under brown shoe. Hey, parts of it still might be there. City water used to have maps.

South of Centralia lake and north of raccoon school there was a weird as hell burn-off flare. it didn't always burn, and apparently did not always release gas. So they rigged a propane pilot light for it. and every random day or 9, a HUGE burp of gas would ignite...I think maybe 70 feet was the biggest one I saw. I don't THINK it is still there, but...if you know where ""hangmans tree"" was, it was about a mile south.

hmm. There a bunch of high end motorcycles buried off of the salem reservoir...

I know this isn't still there, but wamac had a kinda sink hole, mine collapse or something, that had a entire, intact one bedroom house in it, the top of the roof was below ground level.

Either weird petroglyphs, or a damn good fake, in the middle of a woods that is still there according to google earth. about a mile south-east of the coolest old barn - it had a monorail! - I've ever heard of.

this HAS to be a false memory....but there was a incredible flipping railroad bridge, like with amazing arches, something you would expect to see in Italy... in the area that would have to be south of 50, and maybe brubaker creek...and that is just not possible.

"Anna. Sundown town. Which meant colour had to leave town by sundown, back in the day. 
A n n a though nominally named for wife of an early official has colloquially stood for “ain’t no n’s allowed” and folks still echo that viewpoint. 
Some mention it in sheepish shame but others reiterate it as still their own currents statement of bias. 

While some townsfolk were eager to erase this heritage and embrace visitors of colour, others took perverse pride in the race barrier’s legend. 
The town seems almost evenly divided on this. 
Ye never know which group may happen to be present or predominate when ye venture into such a town    So gan canny If broaching Anna. 

Frankly neighboring towns are only a trace better  Fifty to a eighty years y-go we would caution against trips through nearby Cairo, but with recent collapse of its size and the sharp shift of balance after 1980 to majority of colour, this is not likely to be so much danger there any longer. It was deathly dangerous in the 1960s however.  There were shootouts nightly for months in the 1970s, and flagrant baiting in the open streets ten years after the rest of the USA made peace at least in principle with integration. For folks our age touring from far away this town’s regressive drag and some of its lynch legends were a shock to our sensibilities at least when we were made aware 45 to 55 years y-go. 

Southern IL is very much like Kentucky or Missouri was in the interwar years 1914-45 in terms of racial attitudes. The region of S IL is hardly the beacon of freedom one would expect from a conspicuous tendril of legal freedom extending into the border state US south. Many nearby cities and Communities bore an odd pride in being mock-Southern rather than staunch Northern, so occupants went out of their way to own those of colour and favour those who identified as all white. This led to bad air pockets in civil rights compliance in the integration years 1950-80. Most of that is dispelled since. But since that era is just two generations ago and well within our own lives, attitudes are still very sticky and quite imperfectly respectful. As a result the sore points and hard feelings remain widespread under the surface in a way unseen elsewhere . This was about the worst flashpoint region in the USA until 40 years ago or so.  That conflict has faded but is not totally eliminated even today. 

Just gan canny and know that many, if not most in the region do now well appreciate the value of persons of all races.  Laggards must be keenly detected and thereafter tactfully sidestepped.

It is always a surprise how such differences are so much more muted in the UK and commonwealth nations where no legacy of slavery looms over peoples’ preconceptions.

"For the labor thing, they're being sued by the feds for labor violations vis-a-vis wages improperly withheld (or something - you'll have to Google that for the real skinny). I don't think the feds usually get involved unless there's some teeth behind their fight.

As for the cult thing: they are owned by ""The Dayemi Group"" (probably, in actuality, the leader of said group and maybe one or two other individuals are the owners, but Mr. Dayemi and the Dayemi group are quasi-inseparable; nevertheless, I'm sure it's not a cooperative or anything).  

They're a religious sect known as Sufis (the mystical branch of Islam, I believe), and they (he) own(s) a **lot** of stuff around town.  Recently, at least one person has very vocally left and made allegations of, well, cult-like behavior.  I'm sure you can find it if you search for ""carbondale dayemi cult"".

 I can't speak to the veracity of these claims one way or another (though I do know former members who have, with hindsight, called it ""a cult"", though I didn't gather it was so much the ""here, drink this koolaid"" kind of cult as the (still not harmless but much less so, surely) ""our spiritual leader knows all, listen to him, obey him in all things but we won't make you kill yourself or harm others"" kind of cult).

"I'm from the Marion/Carbondale area, but moved in 2018. I know from studies about a year ago that since covid STD cases have spiked massively. I also know that Carbondale is a party campus, which means it can be either fun or dangerous depending on the tempo of the night. 

Beyond that, the city/college leadership is lackluster at best. In 2014-2015 there was an uptick in rape cases. The college was granted 1 MILLION dollars. That was spent on street lights. Yeah. You can look up more, and there is more.

I grew up in the area and lived in Marion a good portion of that too. The police force there is corrupt and has been since the mob was driven out in the 90s. Not much else needs to be said there. Again, just look stuff up and you'll see. 

The top jobs in the area are generally at the super-max or the car factory, Aisin. Both are tough and unforgiving jobs where the employees are clearly underpaid but make more than the average person due to the overtime.

"They say returning to Cairo after 60 years is like remembering a misty dream of wafting along a romantic moonlit river in a small private rowboat, seated next to a breathtakingly beautiful old fashioned model resembling a classic film star like Mary Pickford or Betty Grable, and then traveling through a tunnel of love which turns oot to have have been a tunnel of time, and emerging, looking fondly over to your sweet companion and realising she has devolved into a stooped, pale blue-grey leathery corpse with sunken glassy eyes that stare right through you, sporting a stiff rictus of a skeletal, twisted smile that gapes at you in a ghastly mockery of the beautiful lips you’d planned to kiss so tenderly just moments ago, whilst still gliding through that dark tunnel. The shock and dismay of seeing the reality are instant and unspeakable, and yield to primal terror reminiscent of the old painting by Edvard Munch (“The Scream”)  - look that up on your YouTube and feel the vibe. 

Like strange sad magic the beauty and sweetness you recall is eerily, abruptly dispelled and what remains is today’s haunted, devastated ruin.

We should pray for the folk who have endured this sort of heartbreak for their town, and help them rebuild what ought to be a fine port city. 

Chas Dickens was embittered by his own bad investment there, which was the fault of shady London promoters and not folk of Cairo.  This was what irked him when he made Cairo his model for the sad town “Eden” in his 1843 novel “Martin Chuzzlewit”. And it’s what had stuck in his craw when he condemned Cairo in writings. But just because Dickens’ own tainted fortunes led him to pen his epic personal long-past dissatisfaction with this Cairo,  it need not translate into timeless curse from, or for, everyone else. 

Its only prerequisite now is a spiritual cleansing from its chilling century of race wars, borne of a misguided wannaBe ambition to be “Gateway (or perhaps ‘Hateway’) to the South” instead of what it was intended to be, “the Gateway to the North”.  If the town only took pride in its station as a beacon of northern freedom at the border instead of looking backward in time and geography to pose as a “quaint” (biased) old time southern plantation town, it would have thrived and once it embraces its northern inner soul it can be liberated of its sinister side.

"He says ""Carmangale"".

However, while we're on the subject: Along with MikeStidham's comment, there's a few references to Southern Illinois out there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn3gq-MRAIs

> Well out of southern Illinois, come a down home country boy

> He's gonna make it in the city playin guitar in the studio

> Well he hadn't been there an hour, when he met a Broadway flower

> You know she took him for his money and she left him in a cheap hotel   

This one doesn't reference Carbondale, but here's a video of Jason Isbell performing ""Decoration Day"" on the Strip in Carbondale.  Playing it in Carbondale is notable because he wrote it on Joe Swank's porch.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JLOy32SIFA

Bonus, here's a story about the Rickenbacher that George Harrison bought in Mt. Vernon.  This is the one he played on ""I Want to Hold Your Hand"".

"I like your plan on hitting LGC first. 

From there you could then go to Giant City (a little more touristy but could grab some food on your way, lots of trails in there)

Then make your way to Panthers Den

Rocky Bluff trail by Devils Kitchen lake is also pretty good.

Then i'd go to Bell Smith springs and camp there for the night (cash only). Make sure to check out and swim in the spring but BSS has quite a bit of hiking. You will also be very close to Jackson Falls, but if it hasnt rained in a few weeks it wont be the coolest but still some nice hiking. 

Then head to Garden on the Gods. great overlook and some great trails. 

You will also be near quite a bit of wineries while in the national forest so if that's you're thing stop at some.

Try taking the air filter off and starting it.  If that doesn't work, check your fuel lines to make sure there's not a clog or any debris or air bubbles going through.

">Wait, what do you mean by ""contractor""?

He calls himself a contractor, and he does home repair work. Roofing, guttering, siding, construction, etc. No electrical or plumbing work, maybe some pest control; I'm unsure.

>Why would they ""invite friends at all hours""?

We don't know, that's part of the problem. We don't know what they're doing; the homeowner is quite elderly and afraid to look into any of it herself and only just raised this topic with me. I don't live there, I don't have all the details.

He was given access to do home repair work on her behalf, and has since apparently pushed his way further and further into her life.

"“This Land Is” was completed by the Film Production Unit of Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1969.  University film catalogs describe it as: “This film traces the history and character of the southern Illinois region from its pre-history to the present, utilizing many folk stories and contemporary witticisms as related by southern Illinoisans themselves.  In its prologue, the film defines the area and the purpose of the film which is to promote southern Illinois, especially as it relates to the proposed George Rogers Clark Scenic Drive.”  Additionally: “Here is a motion picture about a region – that southern portion of Illinois called Egypt by its natives.  The film recreates images from the area’s past – of Paleo man who hunted this land, of Marquette and Joliet who explored it, and of George Rogers Clark who captured it.  It re-tells tales by Dickens and Mark Twain who knew this land; and it relates the anecdotes of those who know it now – area miners, farmers and riverboat men.  “This Land Is” reflects the personality of a region – the philosophy of a people.”",t2_7r2mbz8f,ImNot6Four,0,1630779585.0,0,t1_hblgl2j,hblgl2j,True,ImNot6Four,t3_phwqug,https://www.reddit.com/r/southernillinois/comments/phwqug/documentary_about_southern_illinois_this_land_is/,"Documentary about Southern Illinois ""This Land Is"" (1969)",/r/southernillinois/comments/phwqug/documentary_about_southern_illinois_this_land_is/hblgl2j/,12,r/southernillinois,0,12

A dismal swamp, on which the half-built houses rot away: cleared here and there for the space of a few yards; and teeming, then, with rank unwholesome vegetation, in whose baleful shade the wretched wanderers who are tempted hither, droop, and die, and lay their bones; the hateful Mississippi circling and eddying before it, and turning off upon its southern course a slimy monster hideous to behold; a hotbed of disease, an ugly sepulchre, a grave uncheered by any gleam of promise: a place without one single quality, in earth or air or water, to commend it: such is this dismal Cairo.""

when our country used Rail more for shipping goods, Cairo's location made it the natural obvious place for both north-south rail shipping, and cross-loading rail to and from river shipping; I believe smaller ocean going freighters could navigate up the mississippi to cairo at one point.

"Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra) is well known for its edible nuts and beautiful dark, tight-grained wood used for flooring, instruments, and cabinetry. These trees are in high demand, making them a prime target to timber poachers. But you can help protect them!  
  
Join our team of volunteer Timber Trackers to explore hardwood forests throughout central and eastern US and collect leaf, twig, and tree core samples from eastern black walnut trees. Collection is happening now!  
  
Samples are sent to our partners at the US Forest Service who use genetic analysis and DART (Direct Analysis in Real Time), a tool that vaporizes tiny pieces of the sample and catalogs its unique chemical makeup. This information is creating a library of black walnut's chemical and genetic diversity across the entire species range. Land managers will be able to use the library to pinpoint the origin of suspected illegal lumber and prosecute the timber thieves responsible.

>These ""mobilizing passions,"" mostly taken for granted and not always overtly argued as intellectual propositions, form the emotional lava that set fascism's foundations:

-- a sense of overwhelming crisis beyond the reach of any traditional solutions;

-- the primacy of the group, toward which one has duties superior to every right, whether universal or individual, and the subordination of the individual to it;

-- the belief that one's group is a victim, a sentiment which justifies any action, without legal or moral limits, against the group's enemies, both internal and external;

-- dread of the group's decline under the corrosive effect of individualistic liberalism, class conflict, and alien influences;

-- the need for closer integration of a purer community, by consent if possible, or by exclusionary violence if necessary;

-- the need for authority by natural leaders (always male), culminating in a national chief who alone is capable of incarnating the group's destiny;

-- the superiority of the leader's instincts over abstract and universal reason;

-- the beauty of violence and the efficacy of will, when they are devoted to the group's success;

-- the right of the chosen people to dominate others without restraint from any kind of human or divine law, right being decided by the sole criterion of the group's prowess in a Darwinian struggle.

Well, I say people's value depends on what they have to offer the greater whole.

"I think alot of it is the fact I don't use morality or ethics to determine my decisions. I see means of execution as a quotient of desired end result. I've always been noted by my friends to be a fairly emotionless and cold individual, and I really don't care about much beyond advancing American citizens (because lets be honest 90 percent of the human race isn't worth advancing, at least here most people reliably read and write. I can't say that about *Insert 3rd world shithole* and its not our problem to fix that. We have enough waste breathers here we need to throw overboard as it is)

Right wing:

* Illegal immigration needs to be cracked down on. I had ZERO problem with what Trump was doing, We've tried being nice but its time to get real we need to use fear to keep them out. Brutality like separating families gets results. Any illegal we find is thrown in a cage and dumped in the middle of the desert. Second time they get caught is 10 years in prison. I believe we need to switch to stringent merit based immigration. Why do you DESERVE to be let into this country? We don't need 100k more unskilled farmers. We need scientists, engineers, etc. Smart people with educations. People worth allowing to take up resources because they will move us forward. I'm very isolationist and believe the US should withdraw from most foreign deals that are more of a drain than a benefit to us and focus on fixing issues within and making us actually the best country on earth and eventually on other planets 100 to 200 years from now. Shitholes like half the unstable dictators ships in Europe aren't worth our effort. Think of what we could have done with all the money from the wars in the Middle East? Outside the US and people from outside the US aren't our fucking problem. We have zero obligations to them. Zero.
* I believe that people have a right to self defense. The fact that Kyle Rittenhouse is in jail for the clearly justified killings of two convicted criminals, both of which were actively comitting felonies against him (including the illegal possession of a firearm by a felon) even as he retreated towards the police line. I also think its BS that in so many states you can't defend your property with legal force. If I see someone stealing something from my yard, and they resist, I should be able shoot and kill them. Its that simple. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
* BLM is a criminal organization. They support cancel culture which is just the removal of due process to punish people who have done nothing illegal or in many cases nothing wrong. You don't get to bypass our system. If you want change you have to get enough supporters to vote those people in to make those changes the right way through legislation across the country. BLM knows that not enough people support them to do this, the same as the January 6th insurrectionists so they seek to use violence, intimidation, and an array of other fascistic tactics to get the job done. I want minimum 10 year sentences for anyone found to even be associated with BLM, the same as I want for people that are members of all these fucking far right militias that have popped up everywhere and came together to invade the capitol. Their claims of racial discrimination are highly exaggerated, black people are treated the same as everyone else in this country. If you don't want shot, obey the fucking police. Its not difficult.
* I fully support the police, I believe that 99 percent of police are good people (though I'm notably not a supporter of Marion PD, because they appear to all be thugs. Long story) and that there is zero evidence of systemic racism in policing. There are laws, they enforce them. You determine the level of force they used by how much you resist. You are fully responsible for that. They are the ones making an issue of race, most people I know didn't give a damn before BLM.

Left wing:

* I support Universal Healthcare, a sick citizen is a non productive citizen and a non productive citizen is a life without value. There is zero reason we should be running a for profit healthcare system, it in no way benefits the whole. 
* I support Universal Basic Income because allowing people to fall into destitution prevents them from becoming productive citizens again. 
* I support K16 colleges because in order to advance the country and keep up with nations like China in the future we need a well educated, modern work force. The reason China makes all our electronics at this point is because they have the trained workforce to do so. What harm is there in making our citizens more productive? We have way too many people trained in something obsolete. We need to repurpose those individuals before its too late for them and we need to make sure new workers are being produced regularly. Once we rebuild our workforce to be trained in cutting edge technology we can start moving our manufacturing back state side and cut our dependence on China, which is rapidly becoming the greatest threat to global economics in terms of how much disruption they could cause for someone they don't like.
* I believe for profit prisons need to be eliminated, and that drug addiction is a medical problem. There is zero reason to maintain our current system which is designed to create permanent prisoners. The ideal goal is to rehabilitate and turn these people back into productive citizens. Our current system just doesn't do that. Sending a drug addict to prison won't help either, that person needs medical treatment and accessible resources to overcome their addiction and become a productive part of the collective again.
* I fully support LGBTQ and women's rights. The fact of the matter is who someone is or isn't fucking really isn't relevant to if they are a productive member of society or not. On the same line what genitals they have, what they do with their body, or what bathroom they use isn't either. We need people to be comfortable with themselves, happy individuals are generally speaking productive individuals. I also don't see the issue with abortion, its a clump of cells. If the otherwise productive women forced to carry it doesn't want it than just zap it and suck it out and be done with it.
* I believe their should be a hard cap on personal wealth. If we distribute the wealth evenly there is plunty enough for everyone to be comfortable. I also believe companies should be controlled by their employees and operate to the benefit of the nation, not to the benefit of their shareholders.

I really hate Nazis for what they did to the term national socialism. Because if they didn't exist national socialism would be the term I would use because it would mean ""Socialism, for our citizens and our citizens only"" and not ""Cover up for fascism"" and I genuinely have no desire to become expansionist or exterminate any population already within the US. I just want us to reach our peak performance as humans and as a country. So basically what I support is Advancement Oriented Socialism.

My hope is that by the end of my life, slowly slipping away into the void of unconsciousness while looking back at Earth from another planet is a option.

"My car isn't even particularly inefficient though. Also generally speaking newer more efficient cars are out of the reach of lower class people, meaning they have to choose either fuel economy or a safe vehicle when choosing one. The idea that they did this to protect the enviroment is a myth, as with the same fell swoop the governors administration did away with the $37 2 year registration for electric vehicles that would heavily incentivize their purchase and brought the fees up to match their more polluting brethren. It was a cash grab to send more money into the infinite void that is the IL budget. I actually wouldn't mind an (robust, full size, body on frame) electric car given the performance even fairly basic ones have, but I cannot afford the current premium of one, not by a long shot and that's BEFORE factoring in stuff like charging station installation. When I say his taxes were regressive, the people hit hardest are those that are so close to the edge they are living in a single wide trailer eating ramen, and they drive a $500 beater to their shitty job every day. Increases like what Pritzker did is what will drive people like these off the edge into homelessness at which point they are no longer productive citizens and are in fact a burden.

Law and Order is the law being enforced. Equally. I'm sick of rich men and their relatives getting slaps on the wrist while working people get fucked six ways to Sunday. On the same note I'm sick of gangbangers and cholos being let out over and over again on ROI after committing multiple violent crimes until they finally kill someone or hurt someone who matters. You commit a crime, you get the prescribed punishment. If you resist in order to evade that punishment you are dealt with accordingly.

American? That's pretty simple: A citizen of the United States, either born here or who has earned citizenship via the legal route. I believe if you want into this great land you need to come to the front door and tell us why you deserve to be here, what are you bringing to the table. We don't need most of the kinds of people flooding the border who do not have modern skills. We need the most brilliant scientists, engineers, biologists, doctors, etc so we can reserve them for American interests. A lot of immigrants currently are more of a burden than an asset.

Two examples I know of are the fact that a visa worker who barely speaks english drives the semi that delivers cargo to my work each week, and I personally know American Citizens that have prior experience as truck drivers who would love to have his job and they should have priority. Or (back when I was in I.T.) the visa worker with a fake degree mill degree that was taking a valued mid level tech job despite the fact that he was always multiple hours late to the job site and did not know the difference between an HDMI and VGA cable. Those are jobs that should be offered to Americans, even if it means the company has to pay a little more.

I am aware their are gaps in the supply of workers needed, which is why we must implement an K16 college program to produce more Americans trained in skilled labor to combat that shortage. In particular we need to be looking to retrain workers that have fallen out of skilled labor roles as their old industries became obsolete.

I want America to pull out of all the cash wastes like foreign wars abroad that serve very little to the average American, and focus on building a better America. I want to make this the strongest, most advanced, cutting edge nation on Earth. We need to be the shining example of innovation to the rest of humanity. Think about what we could have done with what's been spent on the Middle East alone. We could have fibre to EVERY home in America even in places like Southern IL. We could have launched many different types of social programs.

"Just because you have some egalitarian and some progressive views doesn’t mean you can label yourself as a progressive; especially so since it seems you have quite a few strings attached without you supporting anti-progressive movements... 

Your argument about your car is just proof of why you’re paying more. As I said before, it’s meant to penalize environmentally harmful vehicles so if you don’t want to pay more then you should get a more effective car. You’re choosing to pay more so you really shouldn’t complain about it. You want to show me any US models built and designed in China? Those don’t exist…. Most US cars are produced in the US and Mexico and foreign brands are produced in both The US and Mexico as well as areas such as Germany, S. Korea, and Japan… China has never been known for producing Cars for the US market and Chinese produced cars are even are viewed negatively within China compared to the higher quality vehicles of world.

I'm not driving some overpriced, over complicated piece of shit car built and designed in china. I burn 20 gallons of gas a week just going back and forth from wok 12 miles each way and I don't drive a pickup or an ancient vehicle (05 Grand Marquis). Do you think a Civic would last a year the way our roads are built? No, I need something robust like a Crown Vic or a Grand Marquis. I've literally ripped the rear axle part on this thing and it was like $500 to COMPLETELY rebuild. On most cars I would have been looking at closer to $1200

"I’m a downstate democrat who supports gun regulation, I know quite a few people who do and even republicans who agree if you don’t say it’s an argument coming from a democrat… 

To say you’re progressive and against dealing with race issues is tied into progressive politics and always has been. Progressives care about the issues from regular citizens and considering many minority communities are suffering from a slew of problems then dealing with those issues are helping regular citizens as well as all communities regardless of race. 

Your issues that would lead to voting for a “moderate Republican” come off pretty conservative as well. I’ve never seen a moderate upset over a foid card because it’s literally just a license and a fee for a background check. Not even a large fee at that! Any moderate I’ve heard talk about issues with a foid card are the waiting period. Not the card itself. Your argument about the gas tax seems a to be a bit of a bad take too… the gas tax isn’t much more if you have an efficient vehicle. I drive a bit less than 70 miles to and back for my work and it’s only about $8 (because gas prices increased due to supply issues) more in a given month (~2 a week). If you don’t use effective transportation it’s meant to be a method at disincentivizing driving inefficient vehicles (like trucks) over long distances. If you want to use a truck feel free to, but you will pay the price for choosing the least effective method in most situations. 

Your argument of two different tax zones isn’t a great one either. Like the article mentioned, removing the higher taxes in the Chicago area from downstate has a very negative impact. Two different zones would make things worse unless you’re argument is that the Chicago should further subsidize downstate Illinois without having a say in what they do. Economic unity is literally one of the cornerstones of any state.
