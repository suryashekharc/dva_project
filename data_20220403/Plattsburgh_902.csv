"As someone who spent the majority of 60 years in plattsburgh, I have to say it is not the same small city it was In the 70s. Especially in the past ten years or so it has become much more urbanized, some days with the traffic one might think it's a lot bigger than it is. In general I agree with your observations. 

 Every mayor has tried to revitalize downtown , and failed. Downtown is generally much better now than it was 35 or 40 years ago. City Hall place was always referred to as skid row with the seedy bars . Problem always seems to be that there's just not enough there to warrant being there. 

 Back before the first mall was built, the city had the chance to have it built inside city limits but declined I imagine due to the short sidedness of city leadership then.

"I assume you also aren't very into firearms either; I emplore everyone who is legally able to exercise their right and the gun community is always very welcoming to newcommers and rapidly growing :) check out r/NYguns for people in this state supporting eachother and informing each other and new gun owners how to stay out of prison and enjoy the hobby safely! The safe act is very flawed and most people who support it dont really know what it actually does or they wouldn't. If you ever have tried to handle a ""safe"" firearm then you will quicky realize they are far less safe for everyone involved as the shooter has less ergonomical control of the firearm using most conventional complient grips; they each also come with different trade offs that shouldnt have to be made (Spur, thordsen, fin grips etc are a few of the major examples used for most featureless builds in NY). Do some digging on it and you will see how skewed the system is against you as a citizen. If they catch you with a non-compliant rifle or a pistol without a permit its a felony. Used to be before the safe act unlawful posession of a pistol was just a misdemeanor; cant put minorities in prison for just a simple misdemeanor though lol also if you're in the area and would like to go to the range sometime feel free to message me and this goes for anyone new or experienced! I always enjoy introducing and teaching basic range safety/ettiquitte to others, getting them into the sport and making friends with people into the same things :)

"Grew up here for 25 years, moved to Albany for 2, and then southeast to a major city about 5 years ago. You are so spot on with these observations. I don’t mind visiting but would never want to live there permanently again. Mostly due to the lack of availability for products and good jobs. I’ve considered building a camp on the lake since we are now both working from home, but that poses the problem of having to have someone maintain it during the colder than hell winters.

I think the isolation and depression in the area are not talked about nearly enough. That’s something that I think Stiller actually nailed when he did the Dannemora series.

You forgot Wiggletown. They need to know not to wander down there without a proper chaperone lol

" I like many of the people in this town come from a lower-lower middle class family and have lived in plattsburgh and the sorrounding towns for my entire life. Most people around here dont really trust the government of new york simply because they believe that the city has far too much power in what we can do as ""free"" americans upstate. Most people in this town and in upstate in general are just doing their best to get by and support their familys; there not a fan people prying in their personal lives and forcing them to comply with rediculous laws that have no basis for even existing; one of the biggest being the ""safe"" act (idk if you have any knowlege of what restrictions I'm referring to when I bring this up, from some of your previous posts though I take it you may not be the biggest supporter of the 2nd so maybe not) and also the mask mandates which is a losing proposition to try to enforce here (I know you cant do anything about the high state taxes either so not gonna touch on that one lol). Anthing you can to to lessen the effects of SAFE and some of the other nonsensical laws of the big city being pushed on the rural area and giving people the ability to live the smalltown/rural lifestyle without big brother stepping on their toes and threating to make them felons for posessing a rifle in the wrong configuration/even simply touching a pistol without a permit  would give you some major bonus points in the eyes of your more conservative population and the rest of upstate NY who feels that they lack representation on the issues they believe in. (even from the crazy wiggletown type folks who I can tell don't seem to like you very much currently would start to like you a bit more lol) I believe that some county's mayors sent a public memo to the sheriffs stating they should not be enforcing safe act violations if that is the only crime that has been commited, is that possible for you? Another major issue in the same catagory that should be addressed is the permit system. I personally gave up because I plan on leaving within a year so I likely wouldn't even recieve it on time (Idk how long the wait times are usually in this county but if its like anywhere else its most likely a year or two +) and be forced to pay over $500 just for the paperwork to be processed; if you could just have the county set up an online process, expidite the time it takes down to a few months or less and get rid of the over the top fees making anyone who can legaly own a firearm able to have access to the permits not just people with a lot of cash and time to burn then conservative people would really appreciate that gesture! If you did that and made it clear to folks that we are a more gun friendly county like orange currently is then you would have people from all NY looking at this place while also capitalizing on people moving into NY for the first time from less restrictive states looking to make NY a home; it really is a beautiful area to live if you dont look at the policies of living in this state! Across the lake just looks a little bit nicer to the 2a folks just because of that reason alone (VT is a constitutional carry state) along with he last major issue affecting everyone, not just the conservative base, and it's what I also said in this post; we need to do more for recreation. Currently there is a serious lack of things do as a family or with friends as a teenager or an adult; adults just seem to have bars and kids dont have anything besides bowling, the movies or walking around aimlessly on the beach or at the mall which is slowly loosing all of its best stores sadly; during the winter if you dont ski then there's even less to do. Vermont, albany and canada all have us beat in the tourism/entertainment aspect.  Also why are there so many damn resteraunts and car dealerships!

"""just a reminder that most of the states that pride themselves on lower taxes want to put people in prison for smoking joints"" True; both extremes are actual shit imo but here you become a violent felon for having a scary evil feature on a rifle or even touch a pistol without a permit; neither are good. Also once the weed issue is solved federaly then theres nothing to really worry about with your arguement. It would be a crime for me regardless however because federaly you canno't own a firearm if you smoke weed so it's one or the other currently so that arguement is moot to me to address in the first place. the abortion thing in texas is the more logical extreme arguement to use but I also dont agree with that, that's more a harder conservative stance than i'm willing to go as I value personal freedom and smaller government intervention.

"The only reason people caught wind of what happened was because the person they denied services took a screenshot of their conversation with the shop on Facebook Messenger and posted it, tagging the business. As the post began to pick up steam, the business also posted a status update. It said something like “We don’t do fake nails for male customers, but we’ll do gel manicures and pedicures”.  The business got raked over the coals in the comments because 1) It was kind of obvious that they didn’t want to give the person fake nails because of their gender and 2) A lot of nail techs chimed in and confirmed that their reasoning for not giving men acrylics was a load of codswallop. 

I guess Facebook has a mechanism for detecting when a business page receives a BUNCH of reviews at once.

"It always blows my mind how many people in the North Country never bother to visit one of the most amazing cities in North America, which is a little over an hour away. Back in 2016, Donald Trump did a rally in Plattsburgh. Though I wasn’t there, I am told he made a comment, paraphrased “I bet most of you have never even been to New York City.” While I personally would find this offensive, for many in the North Country this is actually a source of pride. Overall, residents of the North Country are poorer and less educated than our neighbors across the lake. There are significant numbers of people in this region that have never traveled more than 150 miles from where they live. Many people who are from Plattsburgh and surrounding communities simply don’t value culture and travel- their disposable income is spent on guns, ammo and snowmobiles. Following 9/11, the passport requirement presented another barrier to cross-border travel. Many people simply do not have a passport or Enhanced ID. Prior to 9/11, schools in this area would take field trips to Parc Safari and even Montreal. Border communities had a much more intimate connection and many a time at the smaller borders we would simply be waved through without a single question asked. All that said, there are a significant number of people here who LOVE your amazing city. I for one hope we can move past the pandemic and corresponding border restrictions so I can once again travel to Montreal frequently as I did in the past.

"I don't believe it's a question of we don't like baseball as the city has a rich baseball tradition dating back to 1897 with the Montreal Royals. During the early 80's, Expos attendance at the cavernous non-baseball friendly Olympic stadium was among the highest in the major leagues. As a former Expos fan, the biggest reason why the Expos left to Washington DC is because ownership systematically killed the support from the fans.  It started in 1989 when original owner Charles Bronfman sold the team to a group of 20 investors, who then proceeded to go through several player fire sales every time the team became remotely competitive (1994 being the worst).  By the time the team was acquired by New York art dealer Jeffrey Loria as majority owner in 2001, he then played his cards right in which he would move the team if the bilding of a new downtown baseball stadium would be rejected by local and provincial governments.

For the hockey is god argument, I think due to immigration of the past 30 years, the present and future of the sports culture has changed quite a bit in this city.  Soccer and basketball have become much more popular among younger people under 30, since hockey is still an overwhelmingly ""white sport"".  Esports is another reason why younger people may not be into pro sports as they used to be. So because of hockey's relatively waning popularity, I think there can be room for baseball in Montreal under the right conditions (solid ownership, a downtown outdoor ballpark), but I'm not overly optimistic just because MLB player payrolls are insane even with revenue sharing.  We would be like the Oakland A's of the north.",t2_sgrkm,Greysky01,0,1641438682.0,0,t1_hrfwtca,hrfwtca,False,Greysky01,t3_rwyh0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/plattsburgh/comments/rwyh0c/why_montreal_gets_few_visitors_from_plattsburgh/,Why Montreal gets few visitors from Plattsburgh area.

Edit, hell.. if you don't know someone die hard on these beliefs even in the city let me into your friends group so I can cut the ones off who I need to interact with..

The teacher of my daughter, the guy running the gas station we don't go to anymore, the owner of the place we got our car fixed before we got the new one, the postman, our old plow guy, in-laws and their extended family (all of them), etc..

I've heard all of them say something ridiculously xenophobic here or there and now I just don't go to them if I can help it.

The best was the plow guy saying he wanted to plow down illegals coming from Canada when I asked if he had any issues with his plow hitting anything below snow on the road edge when he did work for the town road crew where he lived. Because he thought we all hated commie Canada and he'd rather share fantasy stories about one of them dying by him hitting them with his truck ""before one of them take his paycheck"". I was curiously asking about stumps or hidden rocks. Thats it. And because it was a town directly on the border we were talking about border patrol there so we were talking about immigration.

"Let's be honest, it certainly isn't everyone but there's some obvious xenophobia. I've heard random people mocking French Canadian culture, cuisine, mocking their ability to not always speak two languages perfectly when they are functionally illiterate in their own language themselves,  not even knowing 3 words of any other language...

I know some people around here, college educated even, that are afraid of the commies up north and their socialized health care and want to build a wall on that border too. (I believe this came up as a political joke by the last Presidential Administration but it went over their head, pr not even sure if they weren't kidding in that fictional world).

It isn't the majority but we're kidding ourselves and just play pretending holding a ""welcome tourists"" sign if we don't acknowledge that a notable percentage of people living 20 minutes to the Canadian border haven't even ever crossed it and that this is certainly the reason for some of them. 

I knew one lady who said ""they can keep their communism, I'll take their cash after they turn it into real money, though. As long as they leave.""

Another person I met refused to visit Montreal or Canada as a whole because he heard from a buddy of a friend that ""there's people from other countries there and you don't know how they all think about America.""

He had two DWIs, so he wouldn't be allowed if he wanted... not that I expect he left his rural hometown except to go to Plattsburgh's Walmart or Lowes with his cousin driving for the previous five years anyways.

"The guy currently doing the job doesn't have the required hours in his current position as a lieutenant to be eligible for the position of chief. The other lieutenant has just slightly more time on the job but still not enough.  No officer on the Plattsburgh force does.

There has also been a huge amount of corruption and wrongdoing on the force (the video of the cops attacking a guy in a cell, an officers ""forgetting"" that his firearm was loaded while cleaning it and shooting through a computer, and the many, many, many, accidents officers have gotten into with citizens that have been swept under the rug) and they are just the scummy surface of the whole mess that it the Plattsburgh City Police Force. It is so bad and there has been so much so that their own union lawyer is on record as saying that it is some of the worst they had seen in their career.

The Plattsburgh City Police force is not good, nor is the mayor as he has no ability to think for himself, but getting someone from the outside is what needs to happen to try and start to clean things up. You don't wash you dishes in water that you know to be used and already dirty.

">PLATTSBURGH — Four school districts have scheduled COVID-19 vaccination clinics for students ages 5 to 11 with the Clinton County Health Department.

>The agency will go to the Chazy, Northern Adirondack, Saranac and Peru school districts over the next few months to offer the jabs to this younger population.

>“Our school partners have been very eager to get these clinics scheduled to serve their families,” Clinton County Director of Public Health John Kanoza said in a statement. “CCHD will work with each district and their medical officers directly on their plans.”

>SUPPLIES SECURED

>Kanoza said CCHD has been working with local districts to get these clinics set up since approval of pediatric vaccines came down, and that supplies have been secured.

>Saranac Central School District Superintendent of School Javier Perez said his district is looking to hold a clinic some time in January, though some details need to be worked out.

> He added that it is hard to assess current demand among Saranac’s families, but noted that some had secured vaccinations through their pediatricians and had asked whether the district will be hosting a clinic.

>“Our hope is to provide another opportunity for those who are looking to get their children vaccinated to do so as we did for our 12- to 18-year-olds,” Perez said.

>According to a press release, other districts will host clinics as schedules are finalized. Participating districts will communicate directly with their school communities about the dates and times of the clinics, and how families can register their students.

>A parent or guardian must be present when their child receives a vaccine, the health department said.

>LESS DISRUPTED LEARNING

>This school year alone, Kanoza said, CCHD has seen upwards of 500 COVID cases among K-12 students, faculty and staff.

>“Getting these kids vaccinated will help to protect them, the community and reduce the disruptions in learning due to exposures within the schools,” he added.

>Perez explained that fully vaccinated students would no longer need to quarantine when exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 unless they were symptomatic.

>“Decreasing the number of students being quarantined would be a big step forward towards regaining the normalcy we are all looking for in school and our daily lives,” he said.

>“This would help our students’ education become more consistent and less disrupted.”

>Chazy Central Rural School District Superintendent Scott Osborne previously told the Press-Republican that his district sees COVID vaccinations as one of the best ways to combat the pandemic and allow students to receive in-school instruction.

>He said Thursday that he was pleased CCHD is collaborating with school districts. Chazy’s clinic is scheduled for Dec. 15 and more specific information will be issued to families.

"There's a disproportionate amount of LEO in the North Country for a number of reasons. To start, the entrance requirements in other states, and particularly other countries, are MUCH more stringent.

So a salary of 50/60K or much higher with overtime and a government pension is incredibly attractive. It doesn't help that this is an area that has a suspiciously high amount of prisons that larger urban areas like NYC or Albany ship much of its incarcerated population off to.

"My partner is in their second year of working at SUNY Plattsburgh. We moved from Maine in Summer 2020, but are both originally from upstate/central NY. 

So far, here are my favorite things: taking walks at the city beach with its gorgeous lake and mountain views of Vermont, getting dinner from Irises Cafe and Twisted Carrot, pizza from New York Pizza, coffee from Koffee Kat and Chapter One cafes, the summer farmer's market, poking around little downtown shops and the North Country Co-op grocery, live music and good beer at Ausable Brewing Company and Oval Brewing, being ~20 minutes from trailheads of great hikes of varying intensities (e.g., Silver Lake Mountain, Rattlesnake Mountain, Poke-O-Moonshine Mountain, and Jay are some of our favs), learning to snowshoe and going almost every weekend at different trails, and being ~1-1.5 hours from great towns like Burlington, VT and Saranac Lake, NY. Oh, and we're 60 miles from Montreal. 

Not liking so far: tough to find pet-friendly rentals, high property taxes in nice parts of the city (we just bought a home this summer), and a sense that the city invests in starting projects but not maintaining them (the new mayor seems great though, and committed to raising quality of life with parks and the arts).",t2_42tki,WingsOfTin,0,1636428919.0,0,t1_hjw5m4g,hjw5m4g,True,royalblue86,t3_qnyrth,https://www.reddit.com/r/plattsburgh/comments/qnyrth/whats_living_in_plattsburgh_like/,What's living in Plattsburgh like?,/r/plattsburgh/comments/qnyrth/whats_living_in_plattsburgh_like/hjw5m4g/,2,r/plattsburgh,0,2
"Love the username but you’re wrong. What you are offering here is anecdotal evidence that is not rooted in data. It might appear this way because Trump supporters are loud and vocal (not to mention moronic). Simply stated, they are more visible. You don’t see many Biden flags despite the fact that he carried the City of Plattsburgh and Clinton County by significant margins. As of February 2021, Democrats outnumber Republicans in Clinton County by nearly 2000 registered voters.

"I’m from pburgh and currently live right outside Boston. It’s a different culture for sure. Biggest differences from metro Boston are: 1) housing prices. Like I live in a modest $700k house… I’d be living in a palace in pburgh for that. 2) traffic/parking - you can just drive wherever and not worry about traffic it’s awesome 3) pretty quiet downtown - there are some good bars/restaurants but nowhere near what we have out near Boston 4) access to outdoorsy stuff is WAY easier 5) the winters are no joke - regularly around 0 and negative temps and there’s prob an extra month or so of real winter 

I honestly love it and it’d feel a little small for me at this point in my life (I’m late 30s) but Burlington and Montreal are close enough if you wanna go to stuff.

"So, let me start with the bad. It can be hard to find affordable living in Plattsburgh. A lot of apartments are jacked up in price because of the college (since landlords just have to be cheaper than living on campus), and so it can be hard to find a  good place that isn't run down. While Plattsburgh is the biggest city in the area, there's not much to really do there, unless you like bars/ clubs and such. There's a movie theater which is cool, and some places to walk around, but other than that, not too much. Depending on your political views, this could be a positive or negative, but it's a very republican area. Outside of the college students, most people are republican which, can get annoying at times for me personally.

But now onto the good

* Michigans/ Red Hots- It's basically a hot dog with meat sauce on it but they're absolutely amazing. I personally love the ones at McSweeny's and usually get a milkshake with it and absolutely love it
* 100% Renewable Energy- Plattsburgh runs on 100% renewable energy meaning that electricity is really cheap there compared to almost anywhere else. Especially if you live within the city itself of Plattsburgh. Because it's so cheap, sometimes you'll find landlords that just include it with rent. I lived in Morrisville, next town up, with a roommate and I think the most expensive bill we saw was $100. And that was with an AC running constantly. On average, was like, $60
* Quick Access to the Adirondacks- The Adirondack Park is one of the biggest state parks I believe in the US. I saw somewhere that it's almost the size of Vermont (though idk how true that is). One thing I will say is Adirondack hiking is a lot harder than other places. I grew up in the Hudson Valley and liked to hike, and what people would consider an easy hike in the Adirondacks would be a medium ish hike in the Hudson Valley. That said, it is beautiful and there's a lot of places to go. There's the 46er challenge (Hike the 46 high peaks), as well as the Fire Tower Challenge (hike a certain amount of fire towers in the region). One of my friends hiked the 46 high peaks and made videos on it. Really good quality, and if you're interested this is his youtube: [https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanZaharek/featured](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonathanZaharek/featured) .  A book on the fire towers that's great is by an author called Martin Podskoch. He wrote one for the southern towers and one for the Northern. I had the pleasure to interview him not too long ago, and he mentioned one thing he loves is when new forest rangers are starting, the state gives them copies of his books so they can read up on the history. One of his books here: [https://martinpodskoch.com/Southern-Fire-Towers/](https://martinpodskoch.com/Southern-Fire-Towers/)
* Proximity to Small Towns- There's a lot of small towns in the Adirondacks that are absolutely beautiful. One in particular that I highly recommend is Wilmington. Santa's Workshop is there (though that's more of a kids thing), as well as a road to drive up to the top of Whiteface Mountain. There's a great restaurant called Pourman's Taphouse too that's really good. Less of a small town, but you also have places like Lake Placid or Saranac Lake which are great tourist-y towns and one of them hosted the winter Olympics and has a whole museum or something there (I forget which one)
* Proximity to other Large Towns- You're about 45 minutes away from Montreal, and about 2 hours away from Burlington. Burlington is a much nicer city and has a lot of shops and stuff that Plattsburgh simply doesn't have (ex. Best Buy in Plattsburgh is shutting down).
* X-Country Skiing and Mountain Biking- I would highly recommend checking out [Paul Smith's VIC](https://www.paulsmiths.edu/vic/) as they usually maintain cross country skiing trails I believe. OH also, if you go to the VIC, try to talk with Scott van Laer. He just retired as a Forest Ranger (and the head of the Forest Ranger Union), and is now the director at the VIC. He's very personable and loves talking about his career. He's also pretty active on twitter: [https://twitter.com/ScottvanLaer](https://twitter.com/ScottvanLaer) .As for mountain biking, Wilmington is also a great spot for it- If i'm remembering correctly, they've quickly become the Mountain Biking destination (Well, according to locals at least lmao). A thirteen year old kid started up a whole club for him and his friends to do trails a couple of years ago and it's just sort of exploded since then
* Kid Stuff- I'm not sure if you have kids or are looking to have them, but there's some cool stuff about Plattsburgh for kids. Plattsburgh Central School District made it so meals are free for every student I believe. Also, there's a PBS station in Plattsburgh that, during non COVID years, usually holds a couple of kids events throughout the year, and gives out books and stuff.
* Some trails/ parks- There are also some nice paths and park in Plattsburgh. They're kinda spaced out, but nice to have as an option. Also, you're about a half hour away from places like Point Au Roche which has some really nice trails and stuff. Bit of a self plug, but I did some videos on some of the trails in Plattsburgh for PBS if you're interested: [https://youtu.be/8ttPxBmdzRQ](https://youtu.be/8ttPxBmdzRQ) [https://youtu.be/izUnzbAEt8E](https://youtu.be/izUnzbAEt8E) [https://youtu.be/tu0n2BtHWxs](https://youtu.be/tu0n2BtHWxs) . Also places like The Oval are really nice to just like, hang out in

If you have any more questions, feel free to ask! I lived in Plattsburgh the last 3.5-4 years as a college student, currently living in VT. To summarize, a lot of what's great to me about Plattsburgh is it's proximity to other areas, rather than Plattsburgh itself. It's not a bad place to live, especially with electricity being so cheap, but I've always preferred more rural areas so Plattsburgh just wasn't my sort of scene. Though, if you're coming from Boston, Plattsburgh will probably seem like barely a city to you at all. I had a friend come up from NYC and he referred to Plattsburgh as a small town which... yeah killed me a little on the inside since I grew up in an actual small town lmao",t2_bcqn5,wolfpackalpha,0,1636203002.0,0,t1_hjjm56m,hjjm56m,True,royalblue86,t3_qnyrth,https://www.reddit.com/r/plattsburgh/comments/qnyrth/whats_living_in_plattsburgh_like/,What's living in Plattsburgh like?,/r/plattsburgh/comments/qnyrth/whats_living_in_plattsburgh_like/hjjm56m/,13,r/plattsburgh,0,13

"This looks really unique, I love how personalized it is to the area.

> PLATTSBURGH | A new exhibit called Rum Across the Border Revisited is opening Nov. 10 at the Clinton County Historical Association Museum, bringing visitors into a real-life speakeasy with walls of photos and other documents depicting the North Country’s illegal bootlegging activities.

> Museum officials said visitors will experience a speakeasy complete with a Jazz band and can try their skills on the player piano. The speakeasy is based on a Line House where booze could be moved to the Canadian side of the border when Customs Agents entered from the U.S. side.

>A diorama depicts a bootlegger’s trail complete with the Gulf in Mooers, a famous Rt. 9 trail, a still operation and a miniature county speakeasy. 

>A wall of headlines connects to a map telling of the many events that took place in the County from 1920 to 1933. A series of photos tells more of the story.

"Yeah — I’m still wrapping my head around it but I’m leaning toward this way as well. 

And I have personal experience with this— during the first few months of covid, my insurance randomly stopped my automated payments (I swear to god, and it was so infuriating), and I had no clue my car was no longer registered. I got pulled over 20 yards from my front door, nicely said as much, and the cops were adamant — if your car is unregistered it’s essentially as if you’re driving a stolen vehicle. Like, who the hell’s car is this? How are they supposed to know? They couldn’t let me drive it another inch, had to get towed. I didn’t need to go to the station, not sure if that’s a Mass vs NY thing. But I got my crap out of the car and watched as it got towed away, called Progressive to bitch at them, a friend drove me to the DMV the next day, then went to tow yard to pay my $150. 

Like, you just suck it up. And on top of that, she had a fake sticker? Cops and judges don’t like being lied to, a fake sticker implies she knew full well her car was unregistered.

"I certainly didn't mean they meant it to be Nazi, just its a bold image and the person making it may have seen it online and thought eagle and didn't know the history.

I suggested they use the one on the monument because it looks different.

"So I'm also in WNY, also moving to Plattsburgh (next week!), and also found apartment hunting the biggest hurdle to accepting a job there.  I'm originally from the area though, so that helped a bit with knowing which places may or may not be worth my time.

There's a few reasons why there's a complete lack of apartments available... not the least of which being that school just started up... but the common thing I heard from folks was that the rent has gotten so insane in Burlington that folks are just working in VT, living in NY, and taking the ferry over when needed.  The fact that many office jobs are still partially or fully remote added to this.  I've gone up the last few weekends to view apartments, and talked to several tenants at different complexes who were living that situation.

The best advice I have to check Craigslist often, multiple times per day.   I was between two options that were not to my liking, like at ALL, when finally a listing appeared on Craigslist that suited all my needs.  I managed to catch it within 30 minutes of it posting, emailed back and forth with the landlord, and had the paperwork signed within two days of it being posted.

My daily search was this:
Craigslist
Facebook Marketplace
Usual suspect apartment websites (apartments.com/apartmentfinder.com...)
Meron Properties website (they usually have vacancies, but have very mixed reviews online).

Oh, and just from growing up and going to college in the area... open concept apartments aren't really a thing there.  Not saying they don't exist... but I've never seen one.

Dim lighting, arcade separated the club side from the skate area. The arcade had a 'Feed Big Bertha"" ball toss game, pool tables, and some NeoGeo arcade cabinets which i spent the most time on playing King of Fighters.

The skate area had aged murals painted on the walls and they would do random 'events' every night such as a skate limbo, or slow dance where the 'DJ' would lower the disco ball and turn off brighter lights.

they had a roller-hockey league there, and adult only hours which young me thought only the 'cool' adults knew about.

maybe rose tinted glasses due to nostalgia but i have mostly positive memories of the place. thinking back on it now, it was unique to have a place that offered a feeling of 'night-life' for children.

If you are super COVID crazy… One place to avoid then is Margaret St. or downtown.

During the fall it gets to 65 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Winter is even colder, 25 to -5 degrees Fahrenheit.

Now, you can take the public buses or taxes. The price varies from place to place. You could also do an Uber.

"Don't go to Wiggle Town.

Seriously though, it depends on why you're headed to the 'burgh. If you're a college student, there are rougher student living areas I never liked even while studying there. There are A LOT of scummy landlords who will skirt the rules at the expense of your life. I knew someone whose landlord put them in a ""room"" the size of a narrow walk-in closet (you had to squeeze through a crack in the door and crawl over the bed to access anything) and dismantled the fire alarm in an apartment you could only access through a super-sketchy fire escape. I knew someone else whose apartment was the second floor of a dilapidated looking house downtown with floors that sloped toward the front (you could race bottles going downhill on that floor) and had some kind of infestation long with--yet again--broken fire alarms. 

Overall though, the area is generally safe and people tend to be friendly. Downtown is beautiful and there is a strong community spirit, especially during festivals such as the Battle of Plattsburgh in September or during the Mayor's Cup in July. Koffee Kat is cozy and attracts interesting characters you can easily talk to, little local shops have charm, and you can integrate yourself in the community pretty easily if you so desired.

Fall is beautiful and you get some really good foliage. Usually at least one snow flurry by Halloween. Winter is extreme and if you're from NYC then invest in some Under Armor. It can get -30 with wind chill and I have had my care cartoonishly encased in a block of ice I had to chip away for three days straight (thanks snow plow!) after I had left it parallel parked when I left town for a few days. The snow is glorious if you like the aesthetic, right up until late February/March when it turns a lovely shade of brown and slush season begins. Hope you like shades of mud. 

Public transport is essentially non-existent unless you count taxis. City Taxi was my go-to and fairly reliable. I never rode a bus because in my 7+ years of living there I never figured out the local bus system and discovered I could easily get most places with a bike within Plattsburgh itself. There is a Greyhound service but only use it if you enjoy hellish experiences of inept service, no guarantee of a seat DESPITE BUYING A TICKET FOR A SPECIFIC TIME, an inability to consistently keep to their own schedule, and a lengthy rest at the depressing Albany bus station, home to the grossest public toilets you can find.

**If you want to travel in and out of NYC, the train is 100% the way to go but** **I say this with caution** because it runs one time a day and infamously gets jammed up at the Canadian border, so you may end up running late. Buy your ticket in advanced. You can get a fairly cheap one if you buy early enough and it takes you straight through to Penn Station. Comfortable enough and I **THINK** there are sockets on board but I can't remember. If you take the train back to Plattsburgh, it leaves fairly early in the morning. 

The Plattsburgh airport almost exclusively runs to Boston and Florida and is in the middle of nowhere, so you would also need to arrange for a taxi to collect you. It is not a realistic options. Should you need to fly, Burlington Airport in Vermont is the best option but you would need to drive there. You can get there in about 45 minutes - 1 hour if I recall correctly, but only if you use the ferry.

"Public transportation is ROUGH. I've never taken Uber or anything like that around here, but I have used taxis and the bus system.  


Many taxis only take cash, but a few individual drivers will accept cards via their phone. I've had several instances where a taxi that I called drove past me and never returned. I've also had a few instances where the taxi service just wouldn't pick up the phone.  


As for the busses, they run smoothly, but there no marked bus stops. You have to know the route and just kinda figure out the stops.   


Back around 2013 I would take the bus to go uptown for work. There's one very obvious spot downtown where the busses all line up. I got on, asked for a schedule. They charged me a quarter for it, it looked as if the driver had printed it themselves on their home computer. I had to take the bus most of the up to where I worked, get dropped off at a Kinney Drugs, and then walk another quarter mile or so. Then, to take the bus back downtown, I had to stand on the side of the road a bit of way up from the Kinney, and literally wave down the bus to get picked up. They said that if I wasn't there to flag them down they would not stop. That meant that I had to always be sure to get there quickly enough to be ahead of them passing that area, otherwise I'd be stuck!

Nothing super wild on either side. During the day pretty much everywhere is safe. There are a few sketchy places at night, but nothing bad at all compared to NYC. I'll let others chime in on their thoughts.
>
>How cold does it get during the fall- winter? (Comparing to nyc, that is)

Very. The wind chill is what really gets you. Be prepared to have something to cover your face if you're going to be out in January for an extended period of time.  Will you be a student? Walking between the buildings can be very frigid in the morning.

Wikipedia has some climate data (again, the wind chill on top can bring temperatures down to -20 at times)

There is bus service and a few taxi companies (plus Uber and Lyft). I've never used our busses, so I'll let someone else comment. As far as I'm aware, they take either cash or prepurchasen tokens. Even compared to other small cities, Plattsburgh's public transport isn't great.

So do the people on a low budget wanting a cheap meal. You honestly believe they are getting paid so little they cannot eat?

Raises go up, food prices for the restaurant go up, truckers want a raise because lunch is now double/triple, so transport cost increase, then food and supplies increase....and the cycle continues.

This isn't about wages, people scream ""living wage"" cannot even explain what that means. The focus is not about getting paid more, **its about fixing where their income is going in the first place.**
