"I went there just once, about a year ago, to buy bikes for the family so we could get into the hobby.  Tried Assenmacher first because they were close and had been around forever so I assumed it’d be the place to go.  Stock was minimal, which was par for the time, but the guys there weren’t helpful, the few bikes they did have they didn’t seem interested in selling, they didn’t offer anything like back ordering something.  The whole interaction felt like ‘eh, I gues you can buy one of these if you want.  You figure out if they work for you’. 

Ended up buying from Terry’s Cycle in Alma, which was a crazy long drive for some bikes but they were at least helpful and, as a bonus, had inventory.",t2_3w1s6,havoc3d,0,1648641701.0,0,t1_i2pdibk,i2pdibk,False,AxlCobainVedder,t3_tr3de0,https://www.reddit.com/r/flint/comments/tr3de0/1986_assenmacher_bicycles_nationally_famous_flint/,"1986 Assenmacher Bicycles ""Nationally famous"" Flint Local TV Commercial",/r/flint/comments/tr3de0/1986_assenmacher_bicycles_nationally_famous_flint/i2pdibk/,1,r/flint,0,1

>...President Danielle Green allegedly assaulted member Laura MacIntyre during an afternoon finance meeting. ... MacIntyre said that the incident occurred during a finance subcommittee meeting. She said she was ""brutally attacked"" and that the assault came suddenly and was so severe that she sustained a concussion requiring medical attention. ... MacIntyre told The Flint Journal that Green approached her, grabbed her by the hair, slammed her head against the table and began to punch her in the head. MacIntyre said she wants charges pressed. ""There was blood, there were bruises,"" Chris Del Morone, another board member, said Wednesday night at the meeting.

>“Danielle stood up and took offense at something in particular that I said and have no idea about and walked around our staff secretary and towered over me and started threatening me with her finger. I stood up to back away at which point she grabbed my throat and then grabbed my hair and slammed my head into the table and started punching me in the head,” MacIntyre said. “... It was not warranted, uncalled for and completely inappropriate. It will not be tolerated and we are taking action tonight. ... In the moment I was shocked and surprised. It had never crossed my mind that anything like this would ever escalate like this.” MacIntyre said she is filing charges against Green. Green and MacIntyre have quarreled during public meetings in the past, but altercations never became physical before this alleged incident. Green did not respond to a request for comment. Superintendent Kevelin Jones said the two board members had disagreed about the topic of building new schools and the conversation escalated.",t2_8kfoyigr,Chad_Tardigrade,0,1648142108.0,0,t1_i1yczc0,i1yczc0,True,Chad_Tardigrade,t3_tmorg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/flint/comments/tmorg3/education_beat_flint_school_board_president_green/,Education Beat: Flint School Board President Green removed after alleged assault on Board Treasurer MacIntyre,/r/flint/comments/tmorg3/education_beat_flint_school_board_president_green/i1yczc0/,3,r/flint,0,3

Why is this man our council president?

Eric Mays needs to go.

The city can’t get anything done. He is literally mentally ill and combative. The new council members thought that they could placate him by making him president.

"History: In 1937 The Workers of GM in Flint Michigan organized a sit-down strike where they occupied the plants for 44 days. The UAW Women's Auxillary organized food to be delivered from next door twice a day, as they didn't leave the factory. They established a government for the few thousands men staying there, and enforced rules to protect the factory. After some run in's with local police, and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt rejecting GM's plea for the military, they were allowed to create a union. Allow all GM plants to be unionized with the UAW.

&#x200B;

**Here are nine officials charged in Flint water crisis**  
A total of nine people — many of whom are connected to the state's 2014-15 response to a Legionnaires' disease outbreak — were charged Thursday by Attorney General Dana Nessel's office in relation to the Flint water crisis.

&#x200B;

  
For three former state of Michigan officials, the charges are new. For the six others, charges have been resurrected after Nessel's office in 2019 dismissed all pending cases authorized by her predecessor, Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette, and started the investigation anew.

&#x200B;

  
Those charged range from a former two-term governor to a Flint public works director, from emergency managers to top state officials. Even a maternal infant health specialist was arraigned.

&#x200B;

  
All of the nine defendants pleaded not guilty Thursday and have maintained their innocence throughout the almost seven years since the state-managed city of nearly 100,000 people switched its water source from a Detroit-area system to the Flint River.

&#x200B;

  
The switch resulted in lead contamination of residents' drinking water when the river water wasn't properly treated with corrosion controls. It has also been suspected to have been involved in 2014-15 outbreaks of Legionnaires' disease in the region that sickened more than 90 people and killed at least 12.",t2_ag2bf3jz,HipHop_Local_Legends,0,1646676637.0,0,t1_hzqcmom,hzqcmom,True,HipHop_Local_Legends,t3_t8veiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/flint/comments/t8veiy/here_are_nine_officials_charged_in_flint_water/,Here are nine officials charged in Flint water crisis,/r/flint/comments/t8veiy/here_are_nine_officials_charged_in_flint_water/hzqcmom/,3,r/flint,0,3

"Golden Gate for the West Side.  They only served breakfast before Covid; now they do lunch too to get more business and I think now stay open until 5 or 6PM. I dunno, I go for breakfast. Best flapjacks in town imo. The front room is typically empty early and affords some privacy as well, which is nice. ($)

East Side, Starlite. ($$)

Honorable mention: West Side Diner ($), Capitol ($$).  French Laundry in Fenton if you want to take a ride ($$$). 

Venus used to be the place, haven't been there since they changed the name.

Farmer's Market is interesting as well as deelish early in the day, too ($).

Edit: and you have to go to Dawn's Donuts and get some Nutty's while they are still warm at least once in your lifetime, earl-lie.

Edit 2: After several years of searching the county for a decent fresh bagel done right, the Farmer's Market now has a bagel guy and his bagels and schmear are legit. Einstein's is a joke if you happen to find them actually open on any random morning. Big Apple Bagel in Grand Blanc is *okay* but a far cry from a NYC bagel and they use frozen dough.

Use the funds to do whatever needs to be done to reduce these ridiculous rates. If we have to directly subsidize residents' bills then do that. If we can use it to improve the administration of the water dept then do that too. Negotiate better rates with Detroit, just get it the fuck done.

I've emailed both the mayor and the ward 9 city council member Eva Worthing. I received no response from the mayor, while Eva said she doesn't support water assistance for residents. Apparently she wants to see her neighbors' water cut off.

I would also suggest Burton. You are technically out of Flint but still can find cheaper living. Burton is huge, though, and can border the not so safe areas of Flint (as can Mt. Morris). This is probably the best option if you want cheap but not in the city border. Might make your family happy. 

Flint Twp can be possible to find cheaper places but its a smaller area and not a lot of rentals.

"I lived there when I was in my early twenties,  which wasn't very long ago considering I'm in my late twenties now. There are some real characters there. But I also met some really good people there. It's definitely got some Confederate flag Vibes going on tho. 

I lived in an apartment downtown across from the old white Courthouse for a few years. I had a ginormous window looking out on downtown that I liked to people watch from. 

During Lapeer days I would sit on the ledge and just kind of like check out what everybody was doing, that was always fun. I always seen some wild shit out of that window, even when it wasn't Lapeer days. 

There were literal Confederate flags during Lapeer Days in like 2016. As I sat on my ledge,  people watching, two dudes started arguing over the flag. I distinctly remember one of them saying ""you don't know what that means!!""

One time when I was coming home from work,  at the intersection where Fat Boys is, two guys were fighting on the sidewalk. This quickly moved to the crosswalk, in front of my car. Their friends were trying to break it up, it was a green light but I found it amusing. So I put my shit in park and just clapped, because free entertainment. Their friends laughed.

"""jobs"" cannot be the only factor for escaping poverty. 

Even credible libertarian economists would not argue this. You argued differently, stating there has to be an ""environment to create jobs"".

So, jobs are actually a symptom of that environment, not the cause itself. 

There are myriad ways and things to be done to foster an environment that would attract economic growth. Do I think Flint has been perfectly managed? No, I don't. And I doubt Danny would make an argument that it has. I don't think they are. 

But, reductionist statements, especially when it comes to urban management, *especially* in a city that has been through what Flint has, are beyond ignorant. Especially when the evidence is stacked against those reductionist statements, and they are nothing more than talking points for heads on tv.

What does foster economic advancement? Lowering taxes might, but so could raising them and investing well in infrastructure. The simple and plain fact of the matter is that conditions for jobs *require* infrastructure to be built. This money must come from somewhere. The policies which create that infrastructure must come from somewhere. *None* of the corporations that made Flint great invested in roads, education, safety nets, in long lasting ways that put Flint in a position to weather its storms.

"“Local control bankrupted city.” False, I’ve already provided a link that explains Flint’s population loss as a product of county and state policies. I really recommend you read it. 

“The emergency manager came in to get them out of a financial crisis that was caused by the local officials.” The Emergency Manager was unilaterally appointed by the Republican Governor, authorized under state law passed by the Republican controlled legislature, and was only applied to majority black cities in Michigan. The same GOP controlled legislature eliminated state revenue sharing with Michigan’s municipalities, which actually created the “financial crisis” in Flint in the first place. The city was managing its finances and getting back on track, leveling out after experiencing population loss, and the state essentially fabricated the crisis as a means to manage a historically blue community. They came in with policies of austerity, which cut services only further exacerbating the systemic issues in Flint. This idea that the EFM saved Flint from its financial troubles is so fundamentally flawed.

“The problem with the water was the lead pipes. Not the water.”

Once again, you’re wrong, there’s a reason lead wasn’t leeching into peoples’ homes prior to the Flint river switch. It’s because river water is treated differently than lake water. River water sees higher amounts of phosphates, chlorides, and nitrates, due to the nature of how water flows. They failed to adequately treat the river with anti-corrosives, and the layer that protected the lead solders pipes from leeching into the water was corroded. It WAS the water source that created the issue.

“The lead pipes should have been replaced.” Gee, now you’re saying the city should have spent resources it didn’t have on replacing an entire network of service lines that were functioning fine, until the switch to the river. So which is it, the City should have spent resources on more cops or replaced aging infrastructure? You never answered my question about the largest expenditure in the city budget, what do you think the City spends its resources on? You seem to think that it’s been mismanaged, but have yet to point to a single example of mismanagement in the form of policies passed by our council or executive actions of our mayor. WEIRD. I’ll help you out, public safety is BY FAR the largest annual expense the city incurs, moreso than any other budget priority. Do you think the city could simultaneously cut public safety to replace every service line at once? Come on, man. Use your brain.


“The people of flint were still drinking water that had lead in it.”

No they weren’t, lead exposure was happening in other forms like old homes with lead paint, etc. and it wasn’t happening on the scale that it happened following the Flint river switch.

“I don’t hate the government. I believe the government is inefficient and people are better off with as little government as possible.”

Illegal dog fights were held outside my kitchen window.  I’ve seen drive-by’s.  I couldn’t even own a bike, because the one I had was destroyed by a guy pissed my chain stopped him from stealing it.  My friends and I got cut playing, because of broken beer bottles everywhere.  This wasn’t in MI, but West Columbia, SC.

"I would not buy a house in Flint. Come take a look and drive through the neighborhood.

But in  near future they will be almost worthless because the plague spreads. One area  gets tore up ppl move and destroy another area. Mt.Morris Michigan, right next to Flint is starting to turn into a crap hole now because Beecher which is just north of mt morris was destroyed.  Hardly any business in Beecher except  liquor stores. Bars on windows. Even ppl have bars on their home windows. I grew up in Mt.Morris. Now that Beecher is destroyed all the slum is moving more south. I pray it dont reach Clio in my lifetime. 
I dont go into Flint unless I HAVE TO. The East side is dangerous. Almost every other street you drive down there is burnt  houses boarded up houses with graffiti spray painted,garbage  in yards. Most of the ppl that do take care of their homes are the ones that cant afford to sell because  they will only get pennies on a dollar for them. Flint is a very nasty place.

"Now isn't a great time if you're thinking of fixing a house up. Materials are more expensive than ever (though lumber has come down from pandemic peak levels), contractors are hard to get and expensive. Housing is still cheap in the city, but much higher than it was just a couple of years ago. If cheap housing is the only reason to move, I'd think twice about it. You purchase a house once, but you have to live in the area forever. I'll agree it's not the worst place to live, and the surrounding areas are even nicer (if more expensive).

But if you're really convinced you want to do it, Flint isn't nearly as bad as people think. Just like any bigger city, there's good areas and bad areas.

"Brendan’s mother went public about the case recently.  Basically stated stated Brendan was starting to suffer from some mental issues, and the family were trying to keep an eye on him.  That day, mom was away shopping when he had a meltdown, and the family called the police after he left the house with a gun.  From there, the officers were just trying to stop him from harming someone, and ended up being harmed.  From the tone of what she said, seems to be blaming herself more than anyone else.

"Housing: Almost all of the housing in Swartz Creek are low density single family units, usually the closer to the town center (which is at Morrish/Miller Roads) the closer together and more densely populated the town is. 

Restaurants: Now there are not many restaurants in Swartz Creek proper, though there are 4 places that do come to mind: J T's Country Kitchen, El Potrero Mexican Resturant, Jamison's Irish Pub and Jan's Bar and Grill. Now Swartz Creek does have plenty of fast food and pizzerias, and just outside of the boarders to Swartz Creek we have Pestos plus many other places eastbound on Miller Road

Shopping: There are only 2 stores within Swartz Creek proper, that would be Kroger and Fortino's Food Market. though once again, you don't have to travel far outside of Swartz Creek to find Meijer, and just east on Miller Road you'll find plenty of places to shop

Parks: Inside of Swartz Creek there is basically 1 large park, Elms Road Park, on you guessed it, Elms Road just north of Miller Road. It also includes a Dog Park and kiddie sled hill for the winter time

There is 1 Pre-K/Head Start, 5 Elementary Schools, 1 Middle School and 1 High School. There is also a Virtual/Online school option provided by Swartz Creek Community Schools. There is also a Tech Center/Skill Center operated by the Genesee ISD

Transportation: getting around Swartz Creek can be done a few ways, Walking, Biking, Via Car or Via MTA's Your Ride service. The nearest fixed route service, which is operated by the Flint MTA is the Miller-Linden bus run, which its closest stop would be at the Genesee Valley Mall

Kevscraps14 - Flint native that is just killing it locally and all around the country 

Sebacener - paints realistic large scale upside murals and is from Argentina

Paulymeverertt - another Flint local that you’ll find deep in alleyways with vibrant colors

Enjoy the gallery it’s amazing. Last year 25 of them were turned into plays that you can interact with. New things are being planned for this year that are just as exciting.

Age and interests always help these posts but I'll assume you're a twenty-something that likes to have a drink. 

Downtown is the place to be for all of the above, it's nearing the end of a re-birth period, you wouldn't believe what it was like 20 years ago. But a rebirth: so many newer restaurants and pubs/bars. 

You've been to the Farmer's Market (which has won national awards FYI), good stuff.  

The Torch is one of the oldest bars downtown, known for The Torchburger,  arguably the best burger in town and they always have interesting brews on tap. Great for late-night noshing. 

Across the alley is The Loft, a straight-up no-nonsense bar frequented by a diverse crowd of folks from all walks of life, I always meet interesting people when I go. 

Churchill's: the place for live music (normally/pre-pandemic- all live entertainment is sporadic everywhere right now). They have an amazing selection of Bourbons, a lot of stuff on tap, good food (kitchen open late-ish) and a live music room. They pretty much had bands or a DJ 5-6 nights a week pre-Covid. Another diverse bar. 

Soggy Bottom: the hipster bar. Hipster food, occasional hipster band (jazz or neo-folk), younger hipster crowd. The food is good but it's always packed and bar service can be wanting at times. 

Flint Cider Company: cider bar. No booze, no beer, just cider. But verrrry good cider cocktails. Live music on the weekends, a younger crowd, different type of place but always fun.

Tenacity Brewing: microbrew that makes beer and cider. There is always a food truck parked outside serving something tasty or other. They have live music, typically neo-folk or whatever, acoustic. Monday night trivia. 

The Eberson: old-school type bar with about 35 vintage coin-op games scattered throughout. I think they have game nights too, as in role playing though don't quote me on that. 

White Horse Tavern- it's the community pub, good food, pizza is half-off in weekends dine-in only. They make a great pie. 

Restaurants downtown are all decent if not very good. I think the 501 is overpriced and not that good but pretty much everything else downtown is good though there are a few new places I have yet to try. Blackstone's does great weekend brunches. 

The Hilton is new, I haven't been yet but they have a rooftop bar and everyone says the restaurant downstairs is amazing, they specialize in Italian. 

For entertainment, there is Local 432, an all-ages community oriented music venue. Next door is Jack's Records, the record store. 

Thee is the Capital Theater that hosts the occasional concert and shows old movies. 

Elsewhere:

There is Corunna Road Bar, a dive bar that has live music but more metal/rock/punk. 

Dort Highway is where the strip clubs are. 

The head shop is in the Dort Mall, Paradise Express for all your drug paraphernalia, skull rings, band t-shirts, body jewelry, etc. 

Google ""Flint Cultural Center"" for info on the FIA, The Whiting Auditorium, the library, the FIM and the Planetarium.



Capital Coney Island, the last of the old school Coney Island restaurants, they were a Flint thing. Get two Coneys face up with extra onions, a side of fries and a shake. My death row meal.  

Pizza- a few good places around the area, they're all different in their own way, there isn't a regional Flint-style pizza so to speak so there is diversity,
Latina's, Ruggeros, Luigi's, Fenton House all good in their own way.

Italia Gardens has *amazing* Italian cuisine. 

For my taco fix I like El Azteca at 5 Points. 

There is also an amazing bike trail system throughout the county. You can rent a kayak and kayak the Flint River. There is a disc golf course in Mott Park (it's free). Outdoor activities could be a whole other thread. 

Sports- Flint has hockey and  rugby teams with regular live games. Street racing is also a popular pastime. 

I'm sure others will chime in with stuff as well.

Edit- other stuff I remembered:

The Golden Leaf: jazz club downtown that's been open for over 100 years. 

Chinese food- for takeout everyone is either a fan of Ten Fu or Cantonese Gourmet South, both on Saginaw and both equally good imo. For sit-down, there are the buffets, yes and they are all a decent value if not all that great. 
I think Golden Moon by the mall is freaking amazing, it's my favorite, run by the same family for three generations, a place I would take a date, nice, quiet dining. Empress of China used to be the place but Covid got 'em. 

There is a Woman's Roller Derby team, too but I can't recall their name.

Edit 2- you're on the Westside, between the mall and Flushing. (I'm in Mott Park, near Flushing and Chevrolet). The Westside is sort of a food desert aside from Flushing and around the mall. But here are some Westside faves...

Bongiornio's pizza- I should have included it on the first list. It's always hella busy and you'll wait in line out the door for your takeout but it is worth every bite. 

Mancino's- their pizza is ""okay"" (it's too heavy imo) but their grinders/subs and everything else are dee-lish. By the mall. 

Liberty Diner- casual dining, good breakfast, next to Dalton airport. 

Golden Gate- on Flushing near Ballenger- diner food, my go-to for breakfast- huge portions, cheap. They're only open until 4 or 5 so strictly breakfast/lunch.

On Flushing Road next door to Paradise Mini Mart is a greasy hole in the wall taco joint El Sabo(?). They are the bomb, I always forget about them. 

Places I avoid- Coty's, the Little Caesars on Flushing by the post office (the others are fine), Coney Connexion, Hong Da, Da Red Wagon Express, Pestos. Most all the places by the mall and down Miller Road are chains and speak for themselves. 


Oh, and you can get cheap haircuts at The Flint Institute Of Barbering on Flushing. 

And be sure to check out the creepy assed statues at Sunset Hills Cemetery.

And for the best plate of BBQ in the city, there is a guy that has a smoker/grill trailer who sets up next to K&J's liquor on Flushing next to the post office and serves food all afternoon/evening. Even during winter, he has a motor home with a big window he serves out of. You can get a plate of rib tips, a brat/sausage, mac and cheese, cornbread, greens and beans for $7 and it warms your soul. Or a rack of ribs. Or a pork tenderloin sandwich.",t2_yxxre,MichiganBrolitia,0,1641661876.0,0,t1_hrsq0y4,hrsq0y4,True,Ryn1276,t3_rz3dw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/flint/comments/rz3dw7/newbie_to_the_arealooking_for_suggestions/,Newbie to the Area....Looking for suggestions!,/r/flint/comments/rz3dw7/newbie_to_the_arealooking_for_suggestions/hrsq0y4/,26,r/flint,2,26
