">Language was slipped into the back of the budget bill during the last week of the session, transferring $100 million from Sadowski into the Hometown Hero Housing Program, for down payment assistance and closing costs, to be established and run by the Florida Housing Finance Corporation.
>The bill creating the program was sponsored by Sen. Ed Hooper, R-Palm Harbor, who also co-chaired the Transportation, Tourism and Economic Development appropriations conference committee that made the change.
>Hooper did not return a call or email seeking comment.
The budget doesn‚Äôt provide any guidance on how to set up the program, criteria for who can qualify for assistance or even how much money each individual or family can receive. That‚Äôs because the bill (SB 788) that would have created the program died in committee, said Jaimie Ross, president and CEO of the Florida Housing Coalition, a training and advocacy group on affordable housing issues.
Where the Senate came up with $100 million is a mystery, Ross said, because the original bill had no funding at all, basically leaving it up to the Florida Housing Finance >Corporation to figure out where the funds would come from.
That this broken promise is occurring in the midst of an affordable housing crisis where people have seen rent going up 14% in the Orlando market alone makes the betrayal feel that much worse, Ross said.
>The loss of that funding is especially sad, Ross said, because for every dollar spent on that program, the government can leverage another six dollars. The money is used to provide gap financing for housing projects that developers otherwise couldn‚Äôt afford to build.

"If you want major appliances then you might be better off with multiple separate solar systems. Mini split air conditioners exist that are made to run only on solar (while the sun is out or otherwise grid as backup). Then for the water heater, you could also run a separate solar system to it (the hot water acts as the battery; heating while the sun is out and otherwise slowly cools off over a few days). With the fridge, you might want to look as a chest freezer as they are more efficient.

If saving money is your main goal, then just get a regular grid tie system. 

If you want pretty much everything (lights and fans use little power) with battery power backup, then get a big Tesla solar system.

">Downtown Fort Myers is getting too big for its britches, it's completely innavigable during any event.

Not to mention increasingly full of high-rise condos and hotels, even though the local residents opposed the building of the Luminary Hotel, and that Hotel ""leasing"" (or, in other words, taking over) Centennial Park. More recently, the Luminary Hotel built an amphitheater for its own use; took over the Harborside Event Center, and re-modeled it into ""Caloosa Sound Convention Center and Amphitheater""; and destroyed a previously idyllic park by tearing out several old-growth oak trees. The area reeks of gentrification now, as they kicked out the homeless.

The City and County commissioners have sold out to developers, even in spite of native Floridian residents holding protests, as also seen in the case of the City trying to sell the Lee County Civic Center, which sits on public land, [under-the-table to private developers to develop ""a new mega-hotel, resort, and convention center""](https://www.fox4now.com/news/local-news/babcock-ranch-developer-has-eye-on-lee-civic-center-property). Buckingham Preserve has been a constant residents vs. developers battle for years as Fort Myers continuously expands outwards. The Preserve requires a bare minimum of ""1 house per acre"", but as the surrounding land is turned into miles and miles of suburbs, [developers have been pushing for 2-3 homes per acre](https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/2021/04/08/fort-myers-shores-development-approved-lee-county-commission/7089153002/) to make more money.

Matt Caldwell, Lee County's Republican property appraiser, [is also pro-development](https://www.gulfshorebusiness.com/a-growing-concern-the-diminishing-base-uncertain-future-of-agriculture-in-swfl/):

>These shifts required changing politics, as the Lee County government voted to relax housing density standards in 2015 in that area. But overall, Lee County is filling in as it has been planned since 1987, said Matt Caldwell, who has a unique perspective on agriculture in the region, having lost the statewide election for Florida‚Äôs secretary of agriculture to Nikki Fried in 2018.

>‚ÄúThere are a couple of perspectives,‚Äù Caldwell says. ‚ÄúThe first is that almost everything that gets developed in Lee County in our lifetime was designated for development from the very beginning.

If you look at the areas that were designated then to remain agricultural, Alva is still a rural community. Bayshore is still a rural community.‚Äù

"Coral springs FL here. The population has grown and there's been a ton of development. I remember when the Target plaza went up. More recently Costco was built and I remember there being a ton of conflict with the neighboring homes as they were worried about noise. The giant Barnes & Noble downsized, and Trader Joe's went in. Next door, Parkland has built out a ton. I was already at college so I'm not aware of all of the ways it's changed things but the shooting deeply rocked the community.

Orlando has changed a lot too in the few years I've been in the area. Too many people. Most recently I-4 has express lanes now. I saw UCF's downtown grow from 1 building to an actual small campus, and there's offices being built there. EA will (if they haven't already, not sure) move from Maitland to downtown.

"Ok so the black kid was a cross country runner and not in the race being held. Appearantely he was standing on the track (something that shouldnt have been allowed and a official should removed him immediately or restart the race) during the first lap the kid that gets hit yelled for the attacker to get off the track. After a lap was completed the kid was still on the track and blocking the runners lane. Something to understand here when your running a event like a 1600m you are assigned a lane and if you step out of your lane you will be disqualified. This lead to the kid that got attacked to shove past the attacker to maintain his lane. Its beyond insane to say the kid that was attacked assaulted the attacker because that guy wasnt in the race and was attempting to interfere. The attacker should have been removed from the track before he was able to interfere period. When i was in track if you got anywhere near a lane during a race you got ejected from the event. Where was the officials? Coaches? Why was this guy not only allow to attempt to intimidate a runner but interfere in the match, then attacks a participant and isnt arrested? Thats insane. Sorry the runner did nothing wrong. He attempted to maintain his lane and was interfered with. That should have stopped the race right there and forced a restart.

"I was born and raised in a little town in the mangroves on the gulf coast. I was gone ten years, then came back to check on my family and have been visiting regularly for the past decade.

All the pastures, orchards, and swampland has been replaced with manor homes that literally nobody who was living in town when I left could ever hope to afford. They‚Äôre mostly empty. All the tiny stores‚Äî the butcher shop on the corner that was a block from my home, the old pharmacy we all used, the pleasant little movie theater‚Äî all gone. There‚Äôs a Walmart and a Publix, but all the plazas are dead and empty, and the stand-alone shops are empty lots. The historical stuff is still there, but everything older than 1998 is getting flattened for purchase by speculators.

There‚Äôs a couple nice beaches, so it there were always snowbirds, but like‚Ä¶ I walk around and the median age looks like it‚Äôs about 65, now.  The only people I see in their 30s are contractors, landscapers, and municipal folks‚Äî if you don‚Äôt become a cop, EMT, or firefighter when you grow up, then you‚Äôll be a drink so you‚Äôd better GTFO before you‚Äôre on one side of a jail cell or the other. I don‚Äôt see many kids, even at the beach. The local highschool looks amazing now, but I dunno how they fill it. 

To be clear, this was not a pleasant, prosperous town when I was a kid. It had taken a hit when the local fishing industry fell apart; they were grotesquely overfishing, and subsequently over-regulated, way too late in the game to bounce back. We had canals that were about 8 feet deep on either side of every road in town, that did not get replaced with buried drainage systems until I was in high school. Meth was a problem, alcoholism was a problem, prostitution was a problem. The local pizza place got raided back in the day‚Äî they were somehow running an escort service through it. It felt like there were more auto shops than running cars. It needed a lot of help, but whatever happened in the intervening years was not a sustainable solution to the ills of this place.. 

You know those photos you see online, where a landlord took a paint sprayer to the interior of a shitty rental property, and paint-welded all the cabinets shut, and glued all the roaches down, and filled all the electrical sockets‚Ä¶ everything is still broken and moldy, but now the place is bright white and clean-looking? And the rent is 10x higher? It feels like developers rode into my hometown and did the exact same thing to the entire area. It is still a horribly defective mess, only now all the townies are shacking up with their parents, or five or six people deep in a single apartment‚Ä¶ or just sleeping in the woods, and there is this veneer of ‚Äúluxury retirement living, by the seaside.‚Äù The only people who can afford the homes now are the sexagenarians that show up for the summer, get blind drunk at the tiki bars, then vanish when the season is over, and they sober up, and actually managed to get a look around their surroundings. The whole place shuts off at like 9pm; somebody goes around at 8pm and starts shutting off all the alligators, basically. Not even the slutty pizza place is open and I swear the ocean breeze stops. Nighttime is‚Ä¶ stuffy, now, somehow; if sleep paralysis was an aesthetic, then that‚Äôs what it feels like. 

The smoked mullet is still fucking amazing.

"Born in and raised in Pinellas county (late 70s).

The traffic has gotten worse and construction is everywhere, that's a given. 

There used to be many older apartment complexes and mobile home parks all over the county that were well-maintained and made it possible for lower income people to live comfortably. 

There were a bunch of tiny bungalows on the corner of Missouri and Rosery Rd across from Ted's Luncheonette (claim to fame: John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson shot some footage here for the MTV Movie Awards where they reprised their Pulp Fiction characters) that were built in the 50s or 60s where retirees lived. All of those are gone now. 

Sunshine Mall is gone. Clearwater Mall is gone. Rainbow Roller Rink was the place to be as a kid/teen in the 80s. That's gone. 

My husband and I had our wedding reception/honeymoon at the Clearwater Beach Hotel. It was nearly 100 years old when we got married. Now it's condominiums.

"I feel privileged to live in a State as full of natural beauty as Florida.

SoFla has a tropical climate and cosmopolitan vibe. I grew up in Miami Metro and I would find it difficult to live anywhere else. Even so, CenFla and NorFla are good for those who prefer less crowded places that feel more rural. I had thought of living in either Gainesville or Jacksonville. Orlando has a very large Puerto Rican community, so those who miss the Cuban culture in Miami might like it or Ybor City, which has had a Cuban presence for over 100 years. Though, I find Orlando to be one of those cities in which having a car definitely makes life easier.

I guess the main difference between Miami and the rest of Florida is that in the former one can get away with using just Spanish or Haitian Creole, while in the latter English is a definite must.",t2_15w406p5,Guayabo786,0,1648944565.0,0,t1_i362xi6,i362xi6,True,Triepicsourus,t3_ttrump,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/ttrump/i_love_this_beautiful_place/,i love this beautiful place.,/r/florida/comments/ttrump/i_love_this_beautiful_place/i362xi6/,1,r/florida,0,1

"Ronnie is too young to know why Disney governs itself.  In the 60s going to Florida was like going to Australia.  Most tourists came to see the snakes, crocodiles, huge swamps full of wildlife,  places like Silver Springs, Cypress Gardens and the Everglades were the big draws.

Disney wanted to expand into the Eastern US and wanted a place with warm weather year round (like LA) and dirt-cheap real estate.  They liked the Kissimmee area, but Florida had a problem--their small population and mainly agricultural economy wouldn't support the development or upkeep of such a large project.  So Disney threw a bone into the deal:  we will build and maintain the roads, power, water, sewer, garbage... Even hire and pay and equip our own police, ambulance, etc.  Disney took the burden off of the state, county and city because they would make enough money to cover those expenses and the tax base wouldn't.  Now Ron wants to ""punish"" Disney by making Orange and Osceola Counties pay for all the public services which Disney provides for themselves by being their own development district.  It would break the counties.  Disney would make much more profit not having to pay for its own services or would just have to shutter the park if the counties couldn't provide them. 

Ron can't be so stupid.  I'm sure another state would gladly take the same deal to have the tourist dollars, jobs and rising home values Disney provides.  And it wouldn't stop there.  The other big theme parks benefit a lot from their proximity to Disney.  Who's to say they wouldn't follow.

"And there's some pushback among the left generally and the LGBT community especially for editing of movies and shows to remove explicitly LGBT content when those movies and shows are exported, especially to China.

You could swim out and then be back in waist deep water tossing a football or whatever.  Another thing that makes this specific spot awesome is that one has two nice cities with Tampa and St. Petersburg not too far away.  Makes a great non-beach day when one needs  break from the sun.

All the other beaches were great as well.  St. George Island more remote.  Anastasia SP had a great concession building with reasonably priced umbrella and chair rentals as well as good food.

Like even when I was in high school many high school kids even farther than Tampa work at Disney and make that daily afternoon drive or spend their whole weekend their because they think it will advance/open doors to their theatre/acting careers. 

So on top of many of their employees being young and of the LGBTQ+ community and directly affected by it, yes Disney in general has influence on Ed at the state level. This goes as far as adjusting when schools starts and ends to best benefit Disney‚Äôs summer tourism schedule. When I first started teaching I was due back in the fall around mid August, like 11th-19thor something. Now I‚Äôm sue back 8/1

"The Mackel Brothers were the developers of the town that I grew up in.  They also had other developments in the Tampa and Southwestern part of Florida. Most of these developments were in the 1960's.   My grandmother moved to this town in 1968. After my mother divorced, my mom, older brother and I moved in with her, the following year.  I grew up in the second development of the town or second area.

I live in a Mackel Home which is a rarity now in Florida.  Back in the day or the first 8-9 years that the town I lived in was developed, all or nearly all the homes were Mackel Homes.   Now it's mostly in the older two sections of the town.  There are a few in the 3rd area but not many. Most of the development in the third area was from other developers or home building companies as the Mackel Brothers back in the the early to mid 1970's had sold their company to others.  I can tell by looking at a house in the town if it's a Mackel home.

The town that I lived in was within 30 miles of Orlando and Daytona Beach.  When I was a kid, it was a small town and there was a lot of wooded areas.  In the early 1970's the town had a population of about 5,000 people.  Today it has a population of over 90,000.  It still is primarily a residential area, although you do have shopping centers.

Originally the town was divided up into areas.  The first area was the original development, two area second development and the third area was the third development.  You would ask someone what area they lived in.  Now if I asked someone this, they would look at me and asked me what I'm talking about.  Only the old timers like me know what that means. There aren't many of us left and most people I grew up with moved to other areas in Central Florida.

The first area had a shopping center with a Winn Dixie, a couple of gas stations and a couple of convenience stores.  You had a couple of doctor's office  No post office, no Publix (the nearest one was 13 miles away), no schools, no hospitals (nearest one was 15 miles away).

The second area had opened up a couple of years earlier.  The third area had a few homes and was still under development.  There was a lot of woods out in that area.  Very wooded area.

This was how it was in 1969.  We were an unincorporated area (not a city until 1995).  Fast forward to 2022 (fifty three years later).  Over the years, a post office, more doctor's offices, a hospital and two other shopping centers were built (one in 1984 in the second area With a Winn Dixie) and 1992 in the third area (Winn Dixie). In the early 1990's Publix was added.

You would hardly recognize the town now as there are houses where their used to be wooded areas.  The residential areas in the older sections have seen much better days.  Everyone back in the day kept up their lawns and there was an active Garden Club.  Now so much today. Some of the older homes have been neglected and have had to be torn down.  I've seen this in the area where I lived.

Another major difference  was everyone owned their home.  Buying homes was the main focus. Lots of people moving in and few moving out. There were very few if any rental properties in the town that I grew up in during the early days.  No Apartments (and today there aren't many apartments).  Now many of the homes in the older section of town are rental properties and a sizeable percentage of these are corporate owned.  You have a few mom and pop type rental or where one person rents out a home and usually they live in town.  Not the case for the corporate ownership.  There are some people who live in other countries who own houses here. People come and go all the time.

When I moved here, the demographics was mostly retired people, some of whom had grandchildren.  There weren't a lot of kids and some of the kids were related to the retirees.  Most were not related. You had no schools until the 1980's.  A high school was finally built and in 1988 the school was open.

The population boom was from the late 1970's to 1990. The third area is where the bulk of this grown came from. Wooded areas are now shopping centers or homes.  It was slower in the earlier years but boomed in the late 1980's.",t2_b7mr0px,baronesslucy,0,1648933791.0,0,t1_i35gtrl,i35gtrl,True,undead_opossum,t3_tunl3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tunl3r/people_born_and_raised_in_florida_how_has_your/,"People born and raised in Florida, how has your hometown changed?",/r/florida/comments/tunl3r/people_born_and_raised_in_florida_how_has_your/i35gtrl/,6,r/florida,0,6

"Born in St Pete in 1980. I mostly miss the wildlife and the weather. The city used to be teeming with a hundred different kinds of birds and all the bugs that fed them. The lovebug swarm was awesome to see every year and our swimming pool was always full of beetles.

The city feels so barren of wildlife now. Actually the insect situation is downright creepy. The mosquitos are doing fine but I haven't seen a scarab beetle in years, and the smaller black beetles are just gone.

The weather's gone to shit too, of course. It used to regularly frost every winter, and there was an actual lengthy spring period with gorgeous cool weather. The heat doesn't bother me, I grew up with it, but it was nice to get that wintry break every year, with your breath visible.

I don't really understand the point you are making to be completely honest so I don't know how to respond. Yes there is a few months from when a bill like anti riot or this don't say gay bill is passed until it's deemed unconstitutional. That's the way the system works. Sure Disney could have done more to stop the bill in it's infancy but they didn't and now we must deal with the current state of it.

"Originally from Clermont.

It used to be a sleepy little town full of orange groves and rolling hills in most every direction you looked.  50 was two lanes and there was hardly any traffic even in the middle of the day. Step out side and it was so dark you could look up and see the rim of the galaxy with the unaided eye on a clear night .

Then the developers discovered the place.  Greater Hills set the stage for what was to come. The orange groves, the hills started to disappear, cookie cutter housing developments, strip malls went up, and the stars vanished as the light pollution increased.

Traffic shot up with crime right along side it. Now it is just another suburb of Orlando and another piece of rural small town Florida is gone forever.

"There are four different objectives this bill helps accomplish at once:  
1) The least important to DeSantis, but it's another 'win' for him for his base.  
2) The subject of the bill was chosen specifically to keep the 'culture war' going. That is, keeping the population angry about things that are more about culture than about actual governing. So long as the GOP continues to fight the culture war no one is going to bring them to task properly over the actual issues that are harder to address, such as the current housing crisis.  
3) It gets DeSantis national coverage. This is part of a long term plan to eventually elevate himself into federal politics with an eventual run on the white house. It gets his name into the ears of GOP members in far reaches of the country, so that when he is ready to run those people who live in Idaho or where ever will know his name and have heard of his work. That goes a long way towards building national name recognition which is important for a presidential run.  
4) Lastly, and this is to me the most insidious and dangerous one, it's a bill whose actual *legal* goal is to be a method of removing funding from the public school system *without* having to do the political suicide step of cutting the school systems budget.

Let me explain a bit more on number 4:  
A major goal of the modern GOP is the abolishment of the public school system in favor of a charter school system. To make the general public amenable to the idea they need to turn public opinion against it.

Republicans like to use a method called 'starve the beast' for this. It means you attack popular programs by cutting funding and resources from them until they can't function properly. The public gets irritated at them being incompetent, and then it's easier to get public opinion on the side of reforming or eliminating that system.

DeSantis can't directly remove funding from schools without backlash, but he has devised numerous ways to do it 'backhandedly'.

Look at how breaches in this law are handled:  
* The person who violated the law isn't punished or fired directly.  
* Instead, parents may sue the school and the schoolboard must pay damages out of their own budget.  
* What can and can't be sued over is made intentionally vague in order to increase the chance parents decide to roll the dice and sue, because even if they lose it still costs the school system money.  
* There is no one stated in the bill that should give specific guidelines for how to follow this law because the GOP *wants* it open to interpretation.  
* Since the funding loss of public schools will have been started by a teacher 'stepping out of line and breaking the law', the public won't blame DeSantis for this but will blame it on 'incompetent public officials'.  
* Lastly, ***charter and private schools are exempt from this law.***

Taken all this together and you can see the purpose is to use this to drain funding from the public school system to make it unable to function properly while disguised as a culture war issue to distract the general public from real problems.",t2_5qoec,Kepabar,0,1648931204.0,0,t1_i35bbkw,i35bbkw,False,Noahdg83,t3_tuithc,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tuithc/why_do_people_care_about_disneys_position_on/,"Why do people care about Disney's position on Florida's ""Don't say gay"" law?

"Realtor here and Tampa Bay native.

The one thing you learn getting older is that things will change.  Nothing is permanant.

I grew up in Dover, exit where Dinasaur World is (was Alligator Jungle back then but I digress).

Was surrounded by orange groves and Parksdale Farms strawberry fields, and acres upon acres of pastureland.  Could drive gokarts and motorcycles all over the place, ride bikes through the woods, all sorts of stuff.

Nowadays the strawberry fields are still there, and the streth where I grew up is very similar, but the main change is the orange groves and other land has been bulldozed and turned into home developments.

Plant City's downtown growing up in the 1980s-1990s was mostly shuttered with a department store hanging on.  Antique shops started opening in the 1990s.  Got robbed at gunpoint at the park there around 1997.  Main change is Walden Lake.. was very sad when the golf course there closed, and what was once an extremely nice community now has some really rough patches.

In my 20s I lived in Tampa.  Suitcase City is, to quote Talking Heads... ""Same as it Ever Was.""  Seminole and Tampa Heights where I lived from 1999-2006 is like a whole different world.  When I lived Nicko's was the only place to eat.  Also got broken into there as well.  What's odd is that residential renovations there has seemingly stopped since and moved on to Tampa / Riverside Heights.  But still has that weird 'car lots behind chain link' aesthetic in parts of Florida Ave still.

St Pete has gone from sleepy backwater retirement home in the early 2000s to now a hustling bustling young and vibrant city, and it's been a hellacious transformation to behold.  It's a little gratifying to see a place I've chosen to call home be confirmed as ""with it"" but at the same time makes me sad as prices and home supply has literally vanished the last year or so.

Main thing to realize, especially with real estate, is that there is a 30-50 year cycle.  Seminole Heights in the 1970s-1990s was the area people would use to scare people away from.  Nowadays it's a vibrant section of the city.  Before then Hyde Park was dilapidated and falling to pieces.  St Pete side Old Northeast was a place no one wanted to live, and there were literal mansions construction on 22nd Ave S that for the last 20-30 years have been woefully neglected.  

Change is always happening.  Part of becoming an adult to me is realizing that and learning to be ok with it.",t2_16nkgp,GreatThingsTB,0,1648928955.0,0,t1_i356lej,i356lej,True,undead_opossum,t3_tunl3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/florida/comments/tunl3r/people_born_and_raised_in_florida_how_has_your/,"People born and raised in Florida, how has your hometown changed?",/r/florida/comments/tunl3r/people_born_and_raised_in_florida_how_has_your/i356lej/,16,r/florida,0,16

"Honestly, as a product of the 80s and 90s Florida education system I really wish we had sex education. My father died when I was young so it was just me and my mother, she worked all the time for us to scrape by. I learned the hard way, having a kid at 14. The only education I got about sex from anyone was ""don't do it."" Not even ""hey, you could have a kid and screw up your life"". Florida bible south was very don't talk about it under any circumstances or your going to hell. The one time I did ask someone, a teacher I thought I trusted, Child Protective Services got involved and it was a painful 6 months watching them treat my mother like she's a worthless parent. Never asked as question about that stuff again, boom suddenly I get someone pregnant. Funny how lack of education can lead to bad decisions.

I ran into a lot of people with similar experiences. It's almost like it's some sort of creepy citizen building project by the government. Let kids have kids early so there's this group of young workers or young people ready to go to war at a moment's notice. Don't allow abortion, contraception or even the talk that you could get a kid out of it. The whole system is screwed up and broken for a large segment of people. Telling people they should be parents are all nice and well but what are the kids supposed to do when the parents don't give a shit anyways. I had to be the parent many times in my situation and my mom did actually care. It still amazes me to this day that I'm not much more screwed up than I am. I'm able to lead a successful life despite the absolute shitstorm childhood through my early twenties were.

Just my experience though. As much as I'm unconformable about talking these topics with my kids (now much older) I felt I always had to be open so I didn't end up a grandfather in my 30s because my kids weren't educated.

Desantis has horrible policies that will hurt Floridians.

"A. I don't trust parents to have these conversations. We live in a world  where people still deny basic science like evolution and believe that abstinence only sex education works. Where the average parents waits until their children are sexually active to have ""the talk."" If we leave things to parents it goes wrong, more often than not. And that's ignoring the reality that many parents will choose bigotry.

B. Children don't need to be taught about sexual orientation or gender identity. They come to an understanding on their own eventually.  However, as acceptance has increased and we've gotten more books that  have explored these concepts, the suicide rate for gay/trans kids and teens has dropped dramatically. As they realize they're ok and there are others  like them, they have less thoughts of suicide and are less likely to attempt. And that's important. 

C. Kids are thinking about these topics already at these ages. Kids have a basic understanding of gender at 4 and it is pretty well cemented by 6, 7 at the absolute latest. They know these things and can understand the concepts. We're also ignoring the reality that children start to experience attractions and crushes at this time. I know I had my first crush in 3rd grade, but I didn't know how to process it at the time because nobody told me being gay was a thing I could be.

"Kinda made some sense. If I look up Bill that affects black voters will it pop up the bill number for me to read? 

Also I read the bill they wrote and I understand the viewpoint of teachers not being able to explain why they have a female partner if they are for example. But the point is that they don‚Äôt need to bring up their partner at all. Straight or gay. Let‚Äôs say a student asks you what they did for the week. (K-3) instead of saying I went kayaking with my partner‚Ä¶ A teacher can easily say I went kayaking. When it comes to young children (again K-3) it‚Äôs very easy to dodge those topics. 
I have heard people bring up or whatever another student asks why someone else has 2 moms/dads. That can easily be skirted around as well with a simple ask your parents and Direct the student to the task that supposed to be happening in the classroom. 

It‚Äôs supposed to essentially protect the parents right to Bring those topics up to their children how they want. Kinda like how we don‚Äôt talk about religion in school right? That way the parent chooses how they want religion to be talked about to the child. 

After reading the bill that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting out of it. Which is why I‚Äôm having a hard time understanding how it‚Äôs against LGBTQ. 
You brought up a really good point that they brought up this bill when LGBTQ is the rise.

No shit. It's not trying to. But it DOES capture the general attitudes and mindsets of a population. Because your individual ""heart and mind"" is completely irrelevant. This is like saying ""America isn't majority white because Black people exist."" Or ""there are air bubbles in the ocean, so you can't say that it's wet."" 

I'm trying to remain at least somewhat civil here, but it's difficult to express just how absolutely ignorant you sound without resorting to calling you names.

"I'm a former Cast Member and have a lot of friends and family there. Disney was one of the first companies in the country to recognize same sex marriages for health insurance. They  have also updated their Disney look to be pretty progressive. Disney has a huge amount of people in the LGBTQ+ community. You can't work any job and not be around people in that community. So it's shocking that they say they care about the LGBTQ+ community then donate money to people who are trying to oppress that community.

Disney donates a ton of money to amendments they like. They donated a lot to the gambling bill a few years ago. They also donate a ton to Republicans since they are anti workers. However, inclusion is one of their core values. They teach people how to be inclusive during their first day of training.

"They also like to bring up Sodom and Gomorrah a lot, which is absurd if you've actually read the damn Bible (as so many atheists have and so many ""Christians"" have not) and have any knowledge of the history and customs of the time. I wrote a few papers on this in college, so I'll try not to get too longwinded. Basically, ""Angel"" in this context doesn't mean one of the rings within rings with a thousand eyes, obviously. These are men. Angel, here, means a messenger or representative of the lord. They entered the city and Lot, as is custom and was Jewish law, offered them sanctuary. The city was at war at the time, and the locals were very suspicious. They demanded Lot send the angels out into the crowd ""so that we might know them."" Without getting too into language, know in this case can mean sex, rape, or questioning (likely under torture). Lot, a godly man, refused. Then there was the thing with his daughters that would take way too long to explain, THEN God brought down his wrath.  
  
So S&G was never about ""gay sex."" It was about following God's laws of hospitality and protection of strangers, and possibly about rape. Consensual homosexual sex isn't a theme *at all.*

"What does being the majority have to do with anything? Oh wait, I get it. Life should only work for those in the majority, right? How Boomer of you. I'm willing to go out on a limb here and say that you are white and heterosexual so since the system works for you who cares about anyone else, right? And again, you just proved the entire point of why this Bill/ Law has been given the name ""Don't Say Gay."" That's what it's about. That's why it was constructed. That's why it was put into law. For homophobes. For religious zealots. For narrow minded folks. For a hateful base that thinks they are the only ones entitled to live their lives. For the self-righteous. 

I'm not sure where the whole viruses on lunch meat is going in all of this. I can only infer that your reasons for supporting this law really has no basis besides hate and you have to now go off on some tangent to try to substantiate your reasoning. To use ""spraying viruses"" as a parallel to being homosexual tells me all I need to know about your bigotry. And again, you just proved the point of why this law has been dubbed ""Don't Say Gay."" 

Now to get to your ignorant statement of ""buying children"".... One has to wonder if you hold the same disdain for heterosexual couples that cannot conceive children and find alternate ways of starting a family. Or, like the rest of your argument, is your intolerance of the lack of being able to biologically have children reserved for the LGBTQ Community only? 

You have really shown your true colors here. And the fact that you want to argue that the Dems calling this law ""Don't Say Gay"" is disingenuous would be laughable if it weren't so obtuse. You know exactly why this law was written. You know exactly why it's called ""Don't Say Gay"". Thank you for proving our point.

"A lot of ppl seem to be focusing on the k-3 part of the bill which is part of the culture war red meat for the GOP base.

FYI Gay conversion therapy is legal again in Fl since the Fall of 2020. Some of these children will be ""treated"" with this harmful therapy and further traumatized.
