"I've been there a bunch of times to visit my brother, it's a nice city with some great parks and a very specific kind of strange local culture.  Although, that is probably dying as more people in tech move in and gentrify old areas.  His experience with housing has been frustrating there too though, it's expensive and competitive to live in the city and what you get will be something you really hardly like.  We just talked and he said that it is actually one of the most moved out of, if not thee most moved out of cities right now.  Like I said though, it has a lot to do with tech jobs bringing in younger people with big salaries and native Pittsburgh people cashing out and leaving. He makes over six figures and cannot find a place to buy that is a good deal for his price range, this is the going trend though, sadly.  Frick Park is amazing and there is a big community of people who do everything from mountain bike and trail build right in the middle of the city in the park, it also has old herb gardens, 6 red clay tennis courts and lots of other amazing perks.

"Sure! Sorry about the long story…

I used to go there for my cat, and it was totally fine for basic checkups. I just got frustrated because my cat kept having problems with his ears and they have two doctors who were giving me inconsistent information/different diagnoses. 

Due to covid they still make you wait outside (which is fine by me), but they are really brief on the phone, theres bad reception in their parking lot, and they don’t really welcome follow up by phone/email. Plus they would do a bunch of tests/services without checking with me first so that was expensive.

The final straw for me was when they casually suggested I change my cats entire diet due to repeat ear infections, and then would not respond to questions about what brands/foods would be better. 

I tried cornerstone and it was less expensive, the doctor actually comes out to speak to you instead of calling you on the phone, theyre super pleasant, and they confirmed that briar patch had misdiagnosed the ear infection (3 times!!!). Since going to cornerstone and getting them to treat his ears once correctly, my cat has been all good..

so in short, bad customer service + overpriced + inability to treat a really basic problem.",t2_72o3ns60,bonediggerbeerbelly,0,1648489005.0,0,t1_i2gntnw,i2gntnw,False,ulyses8,t3_tpwt70,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tpwt70/recomendations_for_dog_vet/,Recomendations for dog vet?,/r/ithaca/comments/tpwt70/recomendations_for_dog_vet/i2gntnw/,3,r/ithaca,0,3

"I’m not trying to shit on Bing. I just know my own experience. Midday, I got catcalled for wearing high heeled boots, and I was very objectified/treated very sexually by some men while waiting for the bus back at night. I was also accused of stealing by some clerks at Salvation Army, and I honestly think I was being profiled. My friends went to Bing a few weeks later, and they were harassed by racists. That’s my experience with Bing as of right now, first and second hand. I know a dude who has a friend out there, and my boss is from there, too. They’ve had good experiences, from what I can tell. I don’t want to sound accusatory, but they’re both white men, whereas I and my friends who got harassed are POC and women (or in my case, AFAB).

"Yeah, the central isolation thing is definitely a part of the equation.  Ithaca is basically surrounded by nothing, but it also has had an incredibly stagnant population for over 100 years.

"I’ve lived in both Chambana and Ithaca, and they’re just nothing alike. Urbana is kind of cute with the state streets neighborhood and decent farmer’s market, but Champaign is an oddly conservative McMansion-y nightmare. The airport is smaller than the Ithaca airport, which hardly seems possible (American is the only airline there). Others have mentioned this, but it’s not really a “college town”, it’s a town that happens to have a college. A lot of the students come from the Chicago suburbs, and seem to go back constantly. Maybe because of that the town didn’t really have much of what I’m used to in college towns (certainly not all of the fun festivals and traditions that Ithaca has, like porchfest, streets alive, grassroots, chili/apple/Ithaca-fest, etc.).

"College town also gets pretty bad especially on weekends. And having the most central part of downtown where we all gotta drive through to go anywhere be congested so frequently and with roads in need of constant repair it’s just a bit of a nuisance. Add the “Disneyland traffic” 4 times a year, and roads destroyed by winter and semis on cheaply built roads and your bound to get complaints. I lived in California and went to LA a lot and nothing compares to that level of traffic, but for as small as Ithaca is, there’s a lot of people on the road and not a lot of road for them to drive on. I’m a delivery driver year round so I spend a lot of time out there and while it’s certainly not *terrible*, it doesn’t compare to places in the Midwest where cities were built around rounds and not the other way around. I think Cortland is a great example of we could follow, their roads are very nice and spacious despite having less people on them. Unfortunately Ithaca just doesn’t have a lot of room to expand the roads without closing businesses, so we’re just kinda stuck with things as the city continues to grow and expand.",t2_32partq2,_xxxtemptation_,0,1648181645.0,0,t1_i20xrkb,i20xrkb,False,names12345678901234,t3_tm527k,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tm527k/ithaca_vs_champaign_illinois/,"Ithaca vs. Champaign, Illinois?",/r/ithaca/comments/tm527k/ithaca_vs_champaign_illinois/i20xrkb/,3,r/ithaca,0,3

I think Ithaca/Tompkins County is best suited for people who like the outdoors and like learning. That is what most of the community activities around here are geared towards.

"Thanks for the long post. I guess the main reason for China's racism is more on broad-scope socio- economic discriminations, whereas in textbooks/news little is mentioned about the historic exploitation of ethnic minorities' properties/lands etc (for the sake of the party's credibility). Not only elder-generations, but more often people in 40s/50s, openly discriminate people who hailed from the rural areas, don't speak proper mandarin - the inherent reasons I'd say is ""economic foundation lays the base for the superstructure"" in Marxist education is one, another is the wide-spread notion of social-darwinism. People pay little attention to the traumas of any minority groups as a consequence, and those who wanna help or speak out are typically silenced, which makes the voice in favor of social-darwinism louder. (professors wanna speak for immigrant workers from ethnic minority background are censored) Also, Han ethnicity is the super super majority in China, and conformity is nurtured since pre-school, so people don't treat the ethnic-based exploitations very seriously, which is very sad. Though the younger generations are getting better in understanding inclusive, deliberative democracy there, the majority still holds social darwinist thoughts, and I was personally openly discriminated on socio-economic grounds when I was a student at Cornell.      When a nation blinds so many and then forces the rest conscious ones to buy the propoganda, I don't see any change coming soon.

"I grew up in and have lived in several midwestern states, mostly in college towns between 10,000-70,000 people. While I never lived in Champaign, I have visited a lot to see friends/attend conferences/go to the gay bar when the place I was living didn't have one/etc. I found it to be a perfectly acceptable place: it is bigger than most of the other places I lived and had lots to see & do with enough social opportunities for me (admittedly more introverted than not). 

That said, a lot of the social life revolves around the the university (i.e. tailgating for big sporting events, touring broadway shows at the UIUC theater, etc.), and it has the town/gown divide that so many college towns experience. As someone said already, Urbana-Champaign is bigger -- both in population and geographical size -- than Ithaca. There is certainly life there beyond the campus.

I mostly shrug at the alleged conservative-ness of the midwest, you'll have that across the entire US. In my experience there are thriving counter-cultural scenes everywhere, you just have to find them. It depends on what you are looking for. 

Finally, the ""great outdoors"" is definitely different there, but I don't necessarily think of that as a bad thing. Again, it all depends on what you like. The waterfalls and hiking here are great, but I do also get nostalgic for the big, gridded corn & soybean fields.

"So only Chicago is ""blue"" the rest of the state is VERY conservative and most midwestern states are. If you are in anyway upset by the mask guidelines here, or think Ithaca doesn't do enough against COVID - I am here to tell you what is done here is SO MUCH MORE than rural midwestern states do. In much of southern IL and in MO (I'm from STL, but have lived all over the state) there was no mask mandate except at the universities and in government buildings and only for a few months. I worked as a server while in grad school and would get straight up harassed by some tables for wearing a mask during the summer of 2020. I remember moving here and being in awe that so many people cared and followed the COVID rules. I just tell you this as a question to ask locals if it is something that matters to you.

Personally, I find the stretch North of Springfield IL to Chicago to be immensely boring. It's flat and rural, and reminds me of Kansas. But you are a few hours away from some pretty spots (a few hours = a short distance for middle USA). The cost of living can't be beat though. I paid 900/mo in rent for an entire house with a giant fenced yard. I pay 1,100/mo here for a tiny apartment on the top floor of a building. Even with housing going up everywhere, IL housing is still more achievable than here, and they have beautifully preserved historical houses as well.

It's fucking sickening. I am in the same position and apartments that I literally looked at last year that are fucking studios were 750 and are now 850. Studios are sometimes misleadingly called 1 bedrooms to justify listing $1500 for a 200 sq ft apt. And guess what they are all making the choice to. All of these scumbags could at least keep the rent consistent but nah making money is more important than people being able to afford to live. So now I'm forced to look for a roommate which is it's own shitshow... rant over... dm if you're looking to room with someone for roughly 600 - 750 per person,t2_ak8om,Literallyhitler101,0,1648083186.0,0,t1_i1vew8h,i1vew8h,True,Memento_Viveri,t3_tiz0z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tiz0z7/ithaca_home_rental_and_home_sale_market_both_seem/,Ithaca home rental and home sale market both seem crazy.

"Hi sorry just saw this. Personally I think white folks over the course of history have done some of the most abhorrent acts of racism of any race. 

However, I would readily argue that in modern times, America has come a long way and is much less racist place on average than China. Certainly there’s a lot of baked in systemic issues that didn’t get resolved during the civil rights era, and we definitely have some backward minded individuals scattered through out. But compared to the widely held and openly practiced beliefs held by a majority of the population in China, especially older generations in less urban areas, the United States seems like a cake walk. 

The best way I can describe it is people in America are racist but know it’s wrong, whereas in China some of the awful stereotypes we did away with in the 60s and 70s are still considered truth. This is partly how they get away with the genocides of entire ethnic groups for the last 2 decades with almost no real backlash from the population. 

Obviously the structure of their government which the population doesn’t get a lot of say over is another important factor, but I think you’d be surprised how little awareness a lot of these students have about diversity when compared to a Chinese person who actually lives US. They’re not beyond learning, but Chinas entire society has been extremely isolationist and is only just now beginning to diversify so they have a lot of catching up to do to bring them on par with the US. 

This is part of the reason I think it’s really important for Cornell to have a larger conversation with their students about what happened when they walked out. They may truly just be ignorant, but it’s extremely important their behavior isn’t ignored because what their country is doing is fundamentally immoral and there is no reasonable defense to excuse it. This sort of unfettered nationalism by foreigners, especially ones with access to billions of dollars of intellectual property from one of our top universities (which their government routinely recruits students and professors to steal) shouldn’t be taken lightly. I have a lot of respect for China as a nation and as a people, but I can’t fathom a reason why a top tier university would blow this off as an act of reasonable protest. It’s the most blatant example of hate speech I’ve come across since the Charlottesville march, and the scariest part is that they’re defending something that’s ongoing and happening as we speak, instead of over a monument of something that happened during a time not a single person today was alive for.",t2_32partq2,_xxxtemptation_,0,1648073324.0,0,t1_i1urv42,i1urv42,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tg7ds4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/,"Cornell students from China jeer, walk out on Uyghur student who asked lawmaker about Uyghur genocide",/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/i1urv42/,1,r/ithaca,0,1

"Main thing is to keep your eye out. There’s lots of events that are always going on. So many are even annual, I forget so many until I see the reminder ad for it. 

If you’re willing to travel a little bit, Watkins Glen can be fun to explore. When you’re done exploring,  Inner Peace Floats (like hydrotherapy) can be amazing if you want to kinda relax. Speaking of: Deeply Devoted in Ithaca is right on State St, and amazing right after finals.

I don’t usually recommend Candor, but around this time of year, we have the Daffodil Festival. It’s only 17 minutes away on 96B There are a bunch of vendors (over 100), a beer or wine tent usually, performers, food, and I think there’s a shuttle that takes you to the local family’s HUGE field of Daffodils, and back to the festival. That’s on April 30. 

Boat Show usually has food and stuff.  (Cliff St). I think it’s happening throughout the month 

I’m sure you know about the farmers market. Soon enough we will be back to summer market at Steamboat Landing! 

If you like art, Gallery Night is always fun— April 1st.

This one is expensive but— Balloon Tours are amazing, and I’ve been here for like 10 years. Haha! 

There are multiple antique stores in Ithaca alone that are super fun if you like that sort of thing. The one in Owego is two levels. 

I know you’re at Cornell, so I’m def. assuming you’ve visited the A.D. White Library? One of my favorites. So much history, and just gorgeous. I used to spend way too much time there. If you like history, Cornell has a great Witchcraft Collection, speaking of their libraries. 

The local towns can definitely be fun to get lost in. Some are very eccentric.

"*DO NOT* go to Aspen Dental, despite the fact that they are one of the few providers who take insurance. **story below 

Marina Manunts at Northeast up by the mall does not directly take cornell insurance, but they are absolutely fantastic and its worth asking them whether they can do an out of network reimbursement or something.  They'll be upfront about all costs.  

Tip: If you only ever need cleaning, cornells insurance won't save you money.  I did the math and for me, paying out of pocket was actually cheaper.  

** tl;dr: they waste your time and double bill you for it. I had heard a few reviews about them refusing to do teeth cleaning at the first appointment, so when I called about a cleaning, I asked and they assured me that as long as there were no problems they'd do the cleaning that day.  I sat waiting in the chair for OVER AN HOUR AND A HALF to see a dentist.  They had a TV with movies set up to keep you entertained so clearly this was normal for them.  Dentist finally comes in, spends 5 minutes looking my teeth,  says I'm healthy and good to go for cleaning.  That's when the staff tell me I will need to book another appointment for the cleaning... with another copay, of course.  It was the same staff member who assured me of the same day cleaning - she pretended not to remember our conversation.   Their whole model is a bait and switch and I wasted a whole afternoon.

"In town, Mimi’s, Found, and Significant Elements are my fave second hand stops for furniture and household items. I found Mimi’s more reasonably priced before they moved, but, life. At Found, if you simply ask, they will give you 10% off. Based on my experience, they encourage it. Even if you aren’t in the market for households items, just looking at everything is an enjoyable way to kill some time, especially at Found and SE.

If you haven’t done Watkins Glen State Park, it is beautiful, and walking through the village afterwards can be fun. Havana Glen is also nearby (though probably a drive) and a short, easy hike. And usually very empty. If you take the longer way home through Hector and Trumansburg, you could hit Two Goats for a beer and a roast beef sandwich, or Lucky Hare for a beer and lunch from Babe’s. Both have nice porches and great views. 

The Corning Museum of Glass is worth a visit. If you want to make your own glass, book ahead. May be fun to watch a couple of the episodes of the show, Blown Away prior, so you can have a better idea of the intricacies of their work, if you go their live demonstrations. Corning Market St. is cute with shops and restaurants. For a more budget friendly meal, you can get a slice at Aniello’s. For a more special meal, I recommend Hand and Foot.

Further drives, that may require more planning: 
Letchworth Park - maybe combine with a trip to Rochester (garbage plates, fun breweries).
Bike a portion of the Erie Canal - fairly easy, safe, and beautiful.
Herkimer Diamond Mine - if you go up and over maybe stop by Utica and visit Florentine bakery, share a tomato pie with friends, try riggies, or Utica greens. If you go over and up, hit Oneonta for a cold cheese slice (purportedly where it was invented) and maybe Ommegang. Cooperstown is also very quaint, or it was, haven’t been in a while.

If you aren’t from NY and don’t see yourself in the Northeast post grad, I would try to schedule a short trip to Niagara Falls (maybe even Toronto) and or Montreal (we went through Burlington and stayed a night there). This was really important to a lot of my CA/international friends who didn’t see themselves ever coming back for that kind of trip. We had a blast.

"> Space is very limited

Right, which is why increasing housing stock (especially through high-density housing) is the most effective solution. 

>We already have higher rents, comparing to adjacent communities, and the quality of a significant number of our rental properties are middling or worse.

Implementing rent control would make rents even higher, and make the quality even worse.

>IDK if rent control or rent stabilization is the right solution or not.

It emphatically is not, as decades of research and real world examples have conclusively proven. 

>We've had new apartment complexes and new buildings added and rents do not go down, overall.

Because we are still way behind. It's like antibiotics. If you need ten days of pills and you take three days worth and stop, you don't get better. 

>so long as landlords believe they can get $X in rents for an apartment, there is little incentive to build an apartment that would rent for < $X. This market lacks elasticity.

When you build enough new units, even higher priced units, the cost of older units goes down.

>This doesn't even address the housing availability, let alone pricing.

"I say that demand is unbounded because we have 2 higher ed universities that are also the biggest employers, and the students are often _able_ to pay higher rents -- whether with their own money, or with loans / grants / stipends -- a short-term commitment of 2-3 years isn't unreasonable, but there is no end to this. Space is very limited, Cornell uses up a lot of it, and our occupancy rate is, as of a few years ago, over 90% (I want to say it's around 95%). Many people are doubled or tripled up. 

We _already have_ higher rents, comparing to adjacent communities, and the quality of a significant number of our rental properties are middling or worse. 

When you look at rental listings, many of them list the rent price as the ""per-room"" rent price, despite listing the dwelling in its full-size. So a 3BR / 1.5BA apartment or townhome might be listed at ""$800 monthly"" in the heading, but in actuality it is $2400 monthly. This matters when you have young children who are old enough to need their own bedrooms but not old enough to work.

Ithaca's housing market is a bit anomalous and I wouldn't be surprised if we have outlier behaviors here. 

IDK if rent control or rent stabilization is the right solution or not. We've had new apartment complexes and new buildings added and rents do not go down, overall. There are insufficient units available. Many people are displaced outside of Ithaca, even if they work here, due to rents. It is a _problem_. Long ago, I went to a DIA meeting downtown and asked someone (Gary? I forget; it was several years ago) about this, and basically the issue is that, so long as landlords believe they can get $X in rents for an apartment, there is little incentive to build an apartment that would rent for < $X. This market lacks elasticity.

Many Ithacan landlords don't maintain their properties very well. eg. the Pizza Aroma building is condemned because the landlord, though advised _well_ in advance, declined to do the repairs necessary to keep the building habitable, so the business + tenants that were living there are now displaced.

This doesn't even address the housing availability, let alone pricing.

"Disclaimer: I am a China national and Han ethnicity. I live in Ithaca but don't affiliate with Cornell.

Just trying to explaining what is background where the students coming from with my prospective. Most of your guys probably don't know what happened in 2009 at Urumqi. Civilian Han people was indiscriminately attacked and killed by rioters on the street they lived in their daily life. People believed that the riot was driven by extremists trying to divide the country. After that day, the surveillance has been increased. The detention camp is real. People are force to be taken there to ""learn"" stuff (I would say it's a jail indeed) if you said something bad about the government or practiced religion despite your ethnicity. It is one of the examples that CCP extends their power into people's daily life and violates basic human rights in recent years. Chinese people knows there is a camp. They somewhat support it and think it can prevent similar tragedy in 2009 happening again.  But they don't believe on genocide. They think the genocide is a propaganda from western to divide China. And Uyghurs who talked about seeing genocide in the media are seen as relates to the extremist behind the 2009 riot and try to divide China.  For Chinese people, the unity of the national territory is really the bottom line because we have learned our humiliating history of losing territory before PRC. 

My view may also be brainwashed. But i really hate to see politicians divide and hurt people to achieve whatever goals.  Han and Uyghur people used to be friends and neighbors, but with the extremists committed riot and what CCP does recently, there are invisible barrier psychologically and things just can't go back.",t2_2nz7fllz,MudWarriors,0,1647544592.0,0,t1_i121non,i121non,True,Geek-Haven888,t3_tg7ds4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/,"Cornell students from China jeer, walk out on Uyghur student who asked lawmaker about Uyghur genocide",/r/ithaca/comments/tg7ds4/cornell_students_from_china_jeer_walk_out_on/i121non/,29,r/ithaca,0,29

"The WORST dentist I have ever been to. went for years as a kid and have had;

The wrong fillings put in.

Fillings drilled out to be re-filled because they claimed they never actually did it.

Had chunks of healthy teeth broken off during aggressive and careless cleanings,

Injected with SIX doses of novacaine total as a child (3 in each side) because they didn't want to wait for it to kick in. I ended up having to lay with my face down as to not choke on spit because my whole face was numb for hours.

Waited a year and a half for a mouth guard after it was already made.

And many many occasions of malpractice that have lead to further complications from minor procedures that have kept me coming back expecting to be treated like a person, rather than a dollar sign.

I cannot recommend against this place strongly enough but I am unfortunately in a very similar predicament as OP and can't find a different place to take insurance. I talked to a dentist downtown (can't remember which one from the amount I have called) and got told I need to pay $450+ for a cleaning before I can be looked at and treated for the fairly severe holes I have in my gums, which I'm sure will cost me more than I can afford.",t2_98pqvvgf,Ashamed_Astronaut664,0,1647536141.0,0,t1_i11fkzt,i11fkzt,False,TunaCroutons,t3_tgdh4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ithaca/comments/tgdh4g/emergency_treatment_for_dental_abscess_does/,Emergency treatment for dental abscess - does ANYONE accept Medicaid?,/r/ithaca/comments/tgdh4g/emergency_treatment_for_dental_abscess_does/i11fkzt/,3,r/ithaca,0,3

"The missing context from this (pretty surface-level) article: These students were part the Master of Public Administration degree, and that group of people is at least partially preparing for work in public life in China. They're certainly not generalizable to all PRC students at Cornell. Similarly, the administration of *this specific program* might be swayed by questions about money (it is a tuition-charging advanced degree that costs almost $40K a year in tuition), where other programs (for example Ph. D. programs, where the university pays the student, or the undergraduate program, where there's an almost infinite supply of candidates that can pay) are less motivated by finances.

Everybody in the media pictures Cornell as one thing, when it's actually a big conglomeration of littler things, sometimes extremely specific ones.
