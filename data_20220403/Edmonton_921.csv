"For years and years I've watched the box malls turn into identical garbage holes. They sell nothing but clothes and edge out anything actually interesting because margins on non clothes items are small. Fact is anything sold in Wem can be gotten somewhere close by for way way less. The only people I know who go there anymore are people looking to waste an afternoon or people who have more money then sense.

Tbf there's a lot to do there if you just want to do something with your girl or family to the issue is costs. I ended up going there a few weekends ago my buddy invites me for gokarting we get there and even though my buddy had it planned in advance we were told they were to busy to let us in, so we went around the corner to the glowing minigolf and spent an hour doing that. because there were four of us, we were getting lapped and hurried on by smaller parties which made us feel bad, it cost us 20$ a person and honestly there were only two interesting holes, the rest were straight shots from one end to the other. 

It's pretty much par for anything you want to do at Wem, overcrowded things to do and nothing really interesting to check out. Great waste of an afternoon but expensive as heck to do anything.

We are so fucking lucky to live in one of the safest countries on the planet. We are so lucky we have a functioning democracy. We as Canadians, especially those born here, have won the Life Lottery.  

Yes things could be better, yes there are some fundamental issues with how our systems work but the covid response ain't it chief. It was a worldwide pandemic that the government had to learn and respond as more information came out.  

I do believe small businesses that were impacted should have received rent subsidy from the government and grants to stay afloat and get back on track. I have family members severely impacted by the closures and it is heart breaking to see them struggle, but what was done is done.  

I believe in protecting the vulnerable. We (for the most part) followed measures to protect elderly and immunocompromised during the worst of the waves.

"I am not in Edmonton, but have started my Greener Homes Grant journey so heres what's happened so far.

Applied Feb 20/22

Application approved Feb 28/22.

I had contacted an energy advisor well before applying to the grant, and it just so happened the day after I had been accepted they had contacted me. Unfortunately they were not the service organization I had selected on my application. I got zero word back from the service organization I selected through the government portal. I spoke with the original company I had approached and they said you can change the service organization, so I should book an energy audit with them. I live in a rural area, and they had an advisor doing a three day tour of the area doing audits late march.

I talked back and forth with natural resources canada about switching the service organization to my desired provider, nothing really happened. Same basic auto replies, and other unhelpful information.

Had my energy audit March 26th. I a a bit of a building science nerd, so I knew most of the problem areas in my home, and what I want to do to rectify. But I need the pre and post audit to gain access to the federal funding. And I wanted to know the actual air leakage number of my home.

The audit was straight forward, and my advisor was very helpful. He identified all of the air leakage areas with an IR camera attached to his cellphone. I have the same one, so I was hoping he would use a smoke pencil to show the air leakage areas, as sometimes the IR image wasn't super clear in defining the air leakage. I was at 9.08 @ ACH50

All that being said I contacted the company who did my audit this week, as I could not get them listed on the government portal to change service providers. They said they would look into it as they have contacts at NRcan, and within an hour they had it changed.

Just waiting on my report from the energy advisor until I begin my work. 

Im going to max it out with a heat pump system, and insulating my crawlspace. I will do some air sealing to try and bring my leakage down more than 20% to get the bonus rebating. I will also be stacking these rebates with out local hydro rebates, and the heat pump system should almost be free at that point, and I will be a little out of pocket for the crawlspace insulation. But that should have a payback period of about 5 years, with the energy savings.

All that being said, don't be afraid to contact your service provider and ask questions and get the ball rolling. Its in their best interest for the program to succeed, and people to get the rebates.",t2_jz737zo5,AcanthaceaeMany7322,0,1648999588.0,0,t1_i38dr35,i38dr35,True,TheDarkScanner,t3_p6uwsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Edmonton/comments/p6uwsn/any_tipsadvice_from_those_who_applied_for_the/,Any tips/advice from those who applied for the Canada Greener Homes Grant?,/r/Edmonton/comments/p6uwsn/any_tipsadvice_from_those_who_applied_for_the/i38dr35/,1,r/Edmonton,0,1

"Way worse than any convoy or protest. These gondola's connected to public transit would be permanent eyesores. After the initial honeymoon period they would be virtually unused by locals (too expensive) Edmonton's would not increase tourism as much as predicted simply because it's not connected to private services. Adding private business into the river valley will be met with fierce resistance, I believe if Edmonton allows this it will be a death knell for our protected green spaces around the North Sask. I can't speak for Red Deer but it seems to me locals will not use it if there is an accessible public alternative ie. a pedestrian bridge.

&#x200B;

And what happens when/if the company backing these goes under? Will there be a trust set up to remediate the environment around the added infrastructure and how can we ensure it would be enough?

&#x200B;

My only consolation is this statement:

>Roger Gardner, who consults on gondola projects as principal at Eco-Transit Technologies in Denver, Colo., said about half of the recreational gondola projects he examines are implemented, compared to five to 10 per cent of public transit ones.

The chances of these going forward aren't great and if they do I hope I'm wrong.

">Funny how you notice this now and not precovid. Haha. Mask were implemented to brainwash people and its worked. Youre noticing things you normally wouldnt because it was never an issue before. If you think covid is a valid reason for mask mandates then youve been fooled because plenty of research came out before and during covid that proved masks were ineffective, even fauci himself said they dont work.

Yep, 99% of the medical community. Which features millions of people who are experts in their field. Featuring thousands of hours of research after spending 8+ years getting a master's degree in virology or immunology. 

Are wrong of course /s. You know better than the medical community consensus. 

I can link over 100 things that prove that masking works. You have absolutely nothing but your feelings in this matter.

You made and extreme claim, failed to provide evidence though. So its dismissed easily and immediately. 

But it can't be dismissed? Okay, there's a teapot orbiting Jupiter. Its there. You're brainwashed into believing otherwise. If you think me telling you about the teapot isn't enough of a reason to believe in it then I don't know what to say. youve been fooled because plenty of research came out before and during covid that proved the teapots were orbiting. Even Fauci says they are there!

"Why not? 

There are billions, yes literally Billions of people who wear one everyday, and more that wear it when they are sick only. 

The idea of masking when sick is relatively new to us in NA. But its not new itself. 

Why can't we expect the bare minimum out of people when sick? Ideally they stay home and it's a none issue anyway. Unfortunately we live in a society that doesn't afford us that luxury.  So the next most practical thing is to wear a mask.  So it cuts down on transmission. 

Less sick people means less resources spent on healthcare and more people working their jobs and strengthening out economy. More tax payers means more revenue for everyone.

"I can tell you. They are protesting a national gov that is so focussed on its own ideology and virtue signalling and completely ignoring its fake reliance on ""science"" to feed Justin Trudeau's ego.

He wont even drop the mandate for masks in the House of Commons.

Its also so Justin can say he did not concede one inch of ground when there were thousands of people protesting his over reach on Parliament Hill.

It started out with the lunacy of requiring truckers who dont leave their cabs for weeks to get vaccines. Its blossomed into a movement that recognizes we have an ultra authoritarian PM who will do things HIS way, come hell or high water and if you dont believe that, just wait til he pulls out the the War Measures equivalent to silence you.

"I used to spend a lot of time there in jr high when I had a pass to the water park and galaxy land for 6 months. Then a lot of time in high school because my best friend worked there, but I wasn't a fan. I used to do boxing day there as well because of all of the different stores.

I probably choose to go...maybe 3x a year unprompted by a friend or event. I've been twice since COVID. Once for the rock and gem show, once because a friend had to get something from a store only at West Ed.

If I am going, now it's with specific stores (the good torrid, morphe, mephisto) in mind. It's a good place for restaurants for people who have friends without vehicles (high school, university). If a mall closer to me has the store I want to shop at, I will avoid WEM.

My wife got really sick at New Years. Vomiting, fever, diarrhea. We looked it up, thought it was stomach flu, figured we'd just ride it out. She didn't get better, three days later went to mediclinic. Turned out she had a C. difficile infection from antibiotic use for an infection she'd had recently.

"Define boring.

I live about 10 minutes away and the family and I (pre-COVID) used to go all the time. Sometimes it was a place to go when we had no plans but didn’t want to drive across the city. Other times it was a way to either cool off or get some exercise without subjecting the kids to the cold. 

We would try to time our visits when it wasn’t super crowded and just wander around. Usually we had a specific store that we wanted to go to, but it wasn’t uncommon for us to walk the whole length of the mall.

That being said, lately we plan it out: “we need old navy, bed bath beyond, and Lego. If we park here, do a full loop, get in and out”.

We noticed this last week that it seems like most people forgot their common manners, shoving past me and knocking my 5 year old over (walking closer to the wall, following the flow of traffic - not to slow, not to fast - and the asshole had plenty of room to go around me), stopping in the middle of everything and just doing something with their bags or phone (as opposed to pulling off to the side), and standing to close in general.
