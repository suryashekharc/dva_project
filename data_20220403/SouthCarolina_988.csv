"#So over the last few weeks about 295 designs have been found or made for this contest. The state looked for about 3 years into suitable designs but not were finally agreed. At first a selection of four designs were shown. Then a selected design unconnected to any of them was put forward. Almost no one liked it and it was given an unkind name. Lastly a further two designs were put forward but the decision to go with either was skipped. This study is one of a series - so far we have studied those underperforming design - now 40 contests later we are into the good group. SC has a great flag but it's not tied down to any one image. That could be a good thing but we see many people calling for the state to have one best agreed standard. That's cool - this process aims to find the right result on the back of real peoples votes.

Wow‚Ä¶ Please show me where I said it absolutely always negatively impacts someone‚Äôs life. I said ‚ÄúIF‚Äù, in accordance to my own experiences. I don‚Äôt know how you took what I said and somehow misconstrued that as an argument against weed‚Ä¶

It has negatively impacted my life,personally. So I acknowledge that there is that POSSIBILITY. Just like there‚Äôs a possibility for POSITIVE experience. The same way some people can take certain medications and others can‚Äôt. I have a severe panic disorder and dissociation now from it. I also can‚Äôt handle anti depressants or anything psychoactive to help my conditions as a result of this. Nowhere did I say it would do that to everyone. In fact, I acknowledge that most people have a positive experience. I literally made an argument FOR weed even though it doesn‚Äôt work for me because I know it works for most other people. 

So, ‚ÄúIF‚Äù, as in, if it positively impacts most people‚Äôs life then what reason would they have to reject this bill. People should do whatever  they want if it doesn‚Äôt negatively PERSONALLY affect them. Actually, scratch that, even if someone has a negative experience, let them if they want to continue. I guess the assumption is that if something PERSONALLY negatively affects someone in particular, they probably wouldn‚Äôt want to do it again.

Please go back and read my main message again and come back and tell me what the main idea was of that message. I literally said the government should let ppl do what they want. If you misunderstand at this point, it‚Äôs willful. That one line was not the main point of my message‚Ä¶

It so strange that people think you personally have to be in love with something to support it. That you can‚Äôt make a simple acknowledgement of the good and bad, at a personal level. I also don‚Äôt care to drink every day either (bc again, mental health), but if people wanna do that all day, why should that matter to me or the govt. Just bc I don‚Äôt personally use something doesn‚Äôt mean I have anything against it in a general sense. I‚Äôm pro let ppl do whatever they want.

"To add to this, if you need to protect certain trees there are a few methods. 
 
One is to pound in rebar or small posts around the tree (at least 2'+ away from the trunk) and attach heavy-gage wire fencing. You want the cage at least 3' high and securly in contact with the ground. Chicken wire won't work, you need something thicker otherwise they can chew through. This one looks like a fully grown adult and they are stronger than they look, so it needs to be able to handle a fair bit of weight and force.
 
Another option is to paint the bottom few feet of the tree with a mixture of paint and coarse sand, like play sand. You'll need to reapply periodically and be careful not to paint on too mich of the tree. Most of the instances I've seen this used haven't been as successful as the wire cage option.",t2_67s1e,amberamazine,0,1648949922.0,0,t1_i366h2x,i366h2x,False,Affectionate-Meat-98,t3_tuu0yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/tuu0yf/a_new_neighbor_this_year_on_the_farm/,A new neighbor this year on the farm,/r/southcarolina/comments/tuu0yf/a_new_neighbor_this_year_on_the_farm/i366h2x/,7,r/southcarolina,0,7

"Well don't let the naysayers and analysis of logistics beat you down too hard. Remember, you're *not* in a sub of people trying to move internationally, so there is some bias there. It's easy when there are too many variables to think it's impossible.

Also, something to consider regarding the wide range of salaries: that actually indicates that people can ""make it"" on a wider range of incomes than people on here are saying. If you move into a place and find it's too expensive, you can keep your eye out for a cheaper place. Or if you move to a place that you don't like or is too small, you can move up as well. If your wife gets a job that adds more income and thus more flexibility.

Also, SC is a pretty conservative state politically, but reddit skews more left-wing, so there are a fair number of people on this sub who have a relatively low opinion of the things that go on in this state. But if that's not a deal-breaker for you, then don't let them skew your ideas. If you do get here and hate SC, you can also move states very easily as well.

"I'm not sure why you are asking about salary. Are you trying to determine what to ask your employer to pay you? In that case, do remember that in the US, salaries are usually quoted pre-tax, which is different from some other countries. Average salary data is hard to come by because Americans tend to be private about salary amounts, and it can vary within counties significantly based on various jobs anyway.

The biggest chunk of your income (assuming employer-provided health insurance) is likely rent/mortgage, so start your calculation there. Try to have this be no more than about 25% of your income.  Try to get a sense of average rent/mortgage based on Zillow or another site in a neighborhood you're interested in. Will you be making at least 4x that amount? If so, you can probably afford to live there. If you're doing the reverse, then if the typical rent is $1000/month, then you need to ideally make at least $4000/month, which is $48,000/year. Definitely a good idea to rent starting out so that you can scope out the area before you make a purchase.

You'll definitely need at least 1 car, probably 2 eventually, although many families get by with a single car, especially if one person works from home or something like that.

"*sigh* I know people don't like doing grunt work, but here is the text of the bill that addresses different forms of insulin and the referred text. 

(b) Definitions.‚ÄîIn this section:

‚Äú(1) SELECTED INSULIN PRODUCTS.‚ÄîThe term ‚Äòselected insulin products‚Äô means at least one of each dosage form (such as vial, pump, or inhaler dosage forms) of each different type (such as rapid-acting, short-acting, intermediate-acting, long-acting, ultra long-acting, and premixed) of insulin (as defined below), when available, as selected by the group health plan or health insurance issuer.

‚Äú(2) INSULIN DEFINED.‚ÄîThe term ‚Äòinsulin‚Äô means insulin that is licensed under subsection (a) or (k) of section 351 and continues to be marketed under such section, including any insulin product that has been deemed to be licensed under section 351(a) pursuant to section 7002(e)(4) of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 and continues to be marketed pursuant to such licensure.

(4) DEEMED APPROVED UNDER SECTION 351.‚ÄîAn approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under such section 351 on the date that is 10 years after the date of enactment of this Act.

Therefore, any insulin approved by the FDA is eligible. Additional items, such as strips, lancets, needles will still be on the consumer. However, those costs are not anywhere near as bad as the price gouging going on with insulin.

"The notion that higher education shouldn't be a requirement for certain positions is absurd and idiotic.

I'm not one to normally insult people, and I sincerely don't want to make your day any worse than it may have already been, but good God almighty am I tired of people repeating this ridiculous platitude!

If you have an issue with education ""changing minds"", maybe you're holding tightly to something you shouldn't? Or maybe you're being told that our Educational System is teaching something that in reality, it isn't.

I've witnessed so many baseless accusations, and wildly inaccurate misrepresentations regarding school and learning, that by this point, the only thing I want to hear from anyone's mouth is, how are we going to better fund and prepare our teachers?

I certainly don't want to see or hear anyone pretending as though the way we fix the system *That We Broke* is to just cast qualifications and learning to the side and put charismatic people pleasers in positions of power.

We're falling further behind every year, and our retention of faculty is atrocious. But so long as our politicians continue to say the words that people want to hear, we'll elect anyone regardless of how effective their policies might be.

Which in itself seems to be the point, really.

Convince people that you don't need specialized knowledge to do a specialized job, do a terrible job, and then declare that really no one should have been doing the job in the first place. Then cater to the ego of the masses who don't want to be corrected on any matter whatsoever, and continue to fleece them for all they are worth while continuing to do an awful job at the thing you where hired to do.

And people wonder why our youth lose their every loving minds right about the time they become aware of the world beyond themselves?

We live in self perpetuating insanity. We have the tools to fix nearly anything, but resolutely refuse to do so, or even rely of qualified people to do the job in our stead.",t2_6nfxcd0,RobinGoodfell,0,1648824876.0,0,t1_i2znlq0,i2znlq0,False,historianfeller,t3_ttf60w,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/ttf60w/a_littleknown_oftforgotten_south_carolina_law/,"A little-known, oft-forgotten South Carolina law says state superintendents of education must hold a master's degree.",/r/southcarolina/comments/ttf60w/a_littleknown_oftforgotten_south_carolina_law/i2znlq0/,4,r/southcarolina,0,4

"So it's preferable to die due to being unable to purchase life-sustaining medication?  

I do agree it should be capped for everyone, not just those with insurance.  Perhaps this bill would have been a baby step towards that.  Insulin is not expensive for companies to produce. None of them are jacking up the prices to recoup the expense of research and development of creation of it (was developed in 1921 by individual doctors not working for any pharmaceutical company).  A study in 2018 estimated that one vial of insulin costs less than $4 to create. Even with that price cap, the drug companies are making money producing a drug that people need or they will die.  
Should be a bipartisan issue as former president Trump signed an executive order in 2020 to lower the price of insulin.  But of course today nothing can be bipartisan.

>But the qualifications, approved overwhelmingly by legislators as a way to assure voters the governor would pick someone with **at least those minimal skill**s, became law for all future superintendent candidates beginning this year, despite the referendum failing. 

I realize the thought, the idea, but no degree will give you skills.  Frankly, with modern education, you're often more likely to have better skills WITHOUT the higher education.  Education has become more of a place to try to change minds than teach skills.

I'd like to say I'm shocked our state officials added that, but I'm not.  It wasn't about the skills.

"I've got panels on my roof, was told by a company who came to do a roof inspection that home owners insurance would cover the additional cost.

The company who put my panels on the house are long gone but there was something in the original sales agreement that they would remove and replace the panels once for a new roof.

I actually mentioned this too the roofer and he said they also do solar and to warranty the roof, they would prefer they did the removal and reinstall, apparently trusting their own work over someone else's.

As far as being able to disconnect from the power company I think it depends on the power company. I'm near Greenville on blue ridge co-op, no battery, whatever excess power my panel make basically turns my meter backwards. October until April/May, I pay $28.50 a month which is the delivery charge minimum. Excess gets banked so that the first month of AC is fairly cheap.

"But the problem is the supreme court already decided not all amendments and rights are extended to minors. The right to jury being among one of the many that adults have constitutional rights to. That being said, this extends to guns. They need a parents permission to exercise second amendment rights but that's where standard rights kinda begin. It's a gray area but generally the idea is making it harder for kids to obtain guns to do stupid shit like the above.

The other issue is in response to a dude saying ""hey, people should keep guns more responsibly to prevent tragedies like these from happening,"" you go ""a child should have the right to have a gun.""

"I am terribly sorry that you have trouble understanding basics.

Take anything you want to talk about, there are some things that yeah will have some mild effect, but nothing of any real consequence, but another step will have a greater consequence.

So in what I stated about ""going to church"":  Simply going to a church yes may change you a little, just going to it.  But that is no different than having some effect from going to a Walmart or whatever.  However, if you accept Jesus Christ as Lord, you become born again, meaning you have new life, now THAT is a major change.

""some effect"" vs any meaningful effect is very different.

Another comparison: I walk outside, and it's drizzling (light misting rain), I might get a little damp barely on say my shirt.  If I walk out in the rain, in a drenching downpour, yeah, I'll be soaked.  This difference is a visual way to describe it, but even that cannot fully explain that difference.

Back to the topic, though, the use of illicit drugs (including drinking alcohol), when they do have an impact, which is often, they will lead to much worse impacts.

You can be drunk on alcohol and end up not hurting anyone.  However, you have a far greater chance of hurting others when drunk because you cannot control your bodily movements as well, your reaction time is altered, and you're more apt to ""lose control"" of your emotions.  Same thing with other illicit drugs, of course.

When you're born again, if you allow the Holy Spirit to guide you, he leads you into what to do.  You might do things contrary to what you would otherwise think to do, BUT that won't be something like causing a car accident or going to commit murder or going to sleep with someone who is not your spouse and end up causing harm to yourself and whomever else.

I understand you cannot know the spiritual matters, because you have not been born again.  I pray one day you do come under Holy Ghost conviction and accept Jesus Christ as Lord.

But on the drugs question, I don't think it really takes a spiritual person to understand the issues there.  The problem is whatever drug(s) perhaps have you under their control in that you're addicted and you cannot cut loose.  That doesn't make it OK.  That makes it worse.  I understand it's difficult to give that stuff up. 

There is good news, through all of this.  Jesus came to give life and that life to be more abundant life.  Jesus can free you from whatever has you under its thumb, whether that's some substance or whether it's a habit of some sort that is causing you more harm than you realize.

""For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."" John 3:16 KJV

You're on your way to hell.  EVERY person until born again is on that same path.  If you want to get off that path, if you want to live eternally instead of die eternally in a literal lake of fire, then I beg you to turn to Jesus Christ.

You can laugh, and that is everyone's choice to accept or reject.  But if you reject, know this: You will one day die (we all will), and if you reject Jesus, you will go to hell, then eventually the lake of fire.  There is weeping and wailing, gnashing of teeth, and each person's personal worm that dies not.  It's a terribly place of complete darkness, no rest, no joy, nothing but pain and suffering.  It is no joke.  Jesus spoke about a real person as example of someone who was already in hell in Luke 6:19-31 KJV.  I'd post it here, but probably too long as it is.  Do yourself a favor and read it.  Lazarus was a real person, and he is now in heaven: he was a poor man while on earth.  The rich man no longer has a name, but ""lives"" in a constant state of torment.",t2_258ot8jz,gvlpc,0,1648756151.0,0,t1_i2w1m8u,i2w1m8u,False,RhythmMethodMan,t3_tr4v8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/tr4v8d/antimarijuana_group_launches_opposition_campaign/,Anti-marijuana group launches opposition campaign to SC's Nancy Mace reelection bid,/r/southcarolina/comments/tr4v8d/antimarijuana_group_launches_opposition_campaign/i2w1m8u/,1,r/southcarolina,0,1

"Imagine that you have a house and some land in the country with no neighbors. And so you start to grow a garden.  


And over time you carefully work hard and spend lots of time growing this into a bountiful garden.  


Then, a big neighborhood of houses is built right next door right as you're garden starts to bloom and produce food more plentiful than it ever has before because of your hard work.  


And then you wake up the next morning to go out and harvest YOUR garden, only to find that all the ""neighbors"" from the suburban housing development next door saw your garden, really liked it, and then waltzed on over and picked all the food you grew for yourself and your family, all for themselves and left nothing for you but barren land.  


You come here to flee problems you created and consume up all the wonderful things we've made for ourselves down here, all for yourselves.

That is what YOU are doing to this place. This place was not grown for you. You do not belong, you are not welcome.

"TLDR: If you read my post, it'll be a bit long.  Be prepared to take a couple of minutes of your time if you want to read - *no, it's not a summary, just a heads-up.* ;)

Enjoy playing in that logic.  It will not take you very far.

Going to church actually by itself does not affect your mind, will and emotions.  Sure it can have some effect, just going, but not much just in that part.  Now if you have an encounter with the Holy Ghost where he shows you that you are lost and on your way to hell, and he shows you that Jesus Christ is the one who is willing and able to save your soul, prevent you from going to hell.  THAT indeed will have a great deal of change.

But it's not any change we're talking about here.  When you are born again (John 3:3-7, KJV), you have new life.  It's better for you AND for society, frankly.

With illicit drugs (alcohol is by definition a drug, though it's not commonly called such), your mind, will and emotions are changed in a negative way most commonly.  For one example, it's common for your conscience to basically be put to sleep.  People find themselves willing to do things they would never do otherwise, things are bad, vile: things that are harmful to them AND those around them.

If you compare that to being born again, that's a good comparison, actually.  And the Bible makes that comparison.  See here:

>15See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 16Redeeming the time, because the days are evil. 17Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is. 1**8And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;** 19Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord; 20Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; 21Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.

Ephesians 5:15-21, verse 18 in particular (KJV) 

So yes, being born again will change you, and if you allow the Holy Spirit to guide you and teach you, you will indeed be different, and definitely for the better.

By the way, if you allow Jesus Christ to change your life, you won't need any of the thrills you can get from illicit drugs.  I'm not saying your flesh would not ever be tempted, BUT I am saying it is much different.  Jesus can provide such better peace, joy, excitement, etc.",t2_258ot8jz,gvlpc,0,1648746458.0,0,t1_i2vcegv,i2vcegv,False,RhythmMethodMan,t3_tr4v8d,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/tr4v8d/antimarijuana_group_launches_opposition_campaign/,Anti-marijuana group launches opposition campaign to SC's Nancy Mace reelection bid,/r/southcarolina/comments/tr4v8d/antimarijuana_group_launches_opposition_campaign/i2vcegv/,1,r/southcarolina,0,1

"Its called ""Civil Asset Forfeiture"".

South Carolina, and many states, have laws that let cops seize property and cash without a warrant or probable cause or evidence of a crime if the police ""can reasonably deduce that said property or assets can be used to facilitate drug trafficking"".

If you guys went to court vs the cops over this, the cops would say ""well such a large sum of cash could theoretically be used in drug deals, and the vape batteries and vape cartridges *could* be used to smuggle real drugs, so we took it for safe keeping!""

Its total bullshit too. Because in SC, the police chief gets to keep 90% of the assets seized to be used ""at their discretion"", often kept as a ""performance bonus"". The DA gets to keep the remaining 10% cut, also to be used at their personal discretion.

And even though the cops give you a receipt of items seized (or they are supposed to, even though they usually dont), South Carolina law has no formal established process for citizens to recover their stolen property.

Its tyranny and bullshit. [Here](https://eji.org/news/south-carolina-civil-forfeiture-disproportionately-targets-Black-men/) is a good place to start researching it.

South Carolina cops rake in an average of $5.6 MILLION in revenue every single year from illegal and unconstitutional civil asset forfeiture seizures.

"Hi! I am in a very similar situation, but we‚Äôve already decided on our move to SC. My fianc√© and I are moving from New York for similar reasons that you guys are. We did a lot of research and visited Lexington and Summerville. Lexington was a little too small town low country for us. Summerville was a little bit more of a community feeling inour opinion and that was our runner-up when we were choosing a town to settle in.  We‚Äôve only been to each of those places once, so take with a grain of salt, but it really does depend what you‚Äôre looking for. I would recommend you go visit the town just to get a feel for them before you make a final decision, obviously. People were extremely polite and friendly, we really loved our time there. It really depends if you want to be coastal and risk hurricanes or be more inland. We opted for inland because we don‚Äôt want to risk that. Like many others have said, while Charleston is a great place to visit, we chose not to live there because it is much more liberal and didn‚Äôt really fit what we were looking for. There are some towns that are suburbs of Charleston like Mount Pleasant that we‚Äôve visited, which is very nice, still close to the coast, but more conservative. I would look into these towns thru research, which I‚Äôm sure you have, and look into the demographics of political views, etc., to make sure that they fit what you guys are looking for.

"This sub seems pretty echochambery, so I'm afraid you won't get the best picture of SC here. But, South Carolina can be a great place to live. Lexington is a neat place with some historical areas. Depending on which part of Lexington, it can be one of the more expensive areas for housing in the midlands of SC, but in those nicer areas you'll find nicer schooling, lower crime, etc. 

The climate can be pretty hot and muggy during the summer, but not as bad as Florida. I don't think we broke 100 degrees last year, though we do usually have a few days that get up there. Hurricanes are really only a big deal if you live near the coast. It takes a pretty substantial one to cause any major damage so far inland. If you're looking for a climate and topography more similar to what you're used to, you may could look toward Greenville. It is also a very nice area, kind of splitting the difference between Columbia and Atlanta. Cooler year round, and much more mountainy. 

Farms do well here. They just need a lot of water during the summer to stay through the heat. Depending on the amount of land you're looking for, SC does have decent benefits for those registering farms. 

And SC is very multicultural. There is a large population of Black Americans and Hispanic Americas in the region. I'd actually say the Hispanic population has been growing pretty quick in the last 10 years. I won't lie, you have your racist backwoods folks here, just like everywhere else, but I'd say the average South Carolinian is respectful to anyone, regardless of race. That doesn't mean you won't see Trump signs or Let's Go Brandon flags pretty often.

"Not sure where you read that Lexington is good when it comes to quiet and safe. There's a reason Live PD spent multiple seasons in Lexington County and it wasn't cause it was quiet and safe.

Greenville would be my recommendation for you to look into. But first, let me address your first question and dispel some non-sense. Everyone is welcome here and 99% of people you meet won't give a damn about another person's gender, religious beliefs, sexuality, race, creed, etc. Anyone who makes out South Carolina to be some KKK loving, Nazi worshipping state is probably a closet prejudice themselves and projecting their insecurities.

Ok, now that I've gotten that out of the way:

>Do Hispanic people feel welcomed?

They should. See my previous paragraph. Additionally, Greenville has a sizeable Hispanic population.

&#x200B;

>How intense are the hurricanes?

Depends where you live. If you're on the coast, you get the full force of whatever a hurricane has to throw at you whether it's a cat 1 or cat 5. If you're in the Midlands (Columbia) the worst you'd most likely ever see are cat 1-2 winds with rain/flooding being a bigger worry; most of the time winds won't be above tropical storm. If you're in the Upstate (Greenville) it's uncommon for winds to be stronger than tropical storm force and rain/flooding is the bigger concern.

&#x200B;

>Is there an extra insurance you need for a house?

On the coast, yes. In Columbia, I don't think so. In Greenville, no.

&#x200B;

>Are the summers like Florida heat?

No. There's some days that get as humid as Florida, but they're typically not that humid.

&#x200B;

>Anyone do veggie gardens in the summer? How is it?

Yep! I had really good luck with hot peppers last summer (cayenne and habanero) and cherry tomatoes. Managed to even grow a little pumpkin. Bell peppers and cucumber struggled. My garden was absolutely a make shift, thrown together little thing. It's a wonder anything even grew. This year, we properly tilled an 8'x8' area that we'll be planting in a week or two.

"lol my sister moved from SC to California but I know things are going downhill over there. 

Lexington is kind of gross in my opinion. There are nicer areas in Lexington but it‚Äôs not a place I‚Äôd recommend anyone move to. 
Columbia as a city is not bad but it‚Äôs a college town and really only great if you‚Äôre going to school there. Not a ton to do really and it‚Äôs much hotter than Greenville or Charleston generally. 

I grew up in Greenville and it‚Äôs pretty solid but becoming overpriced for what it is. You‚Äôre not going to get hurricanes in Columbia or Greenville. Just heavy rain and people evacuating towards your area. Possibly flooding in Columbia so I wouldn‚Äôt buy in a flood zone. 
Charleston is nice but you‚Äôre going to evacuate almost every year for hurricanes and there is the possibility that your house floods or isn‚Äôt there when you return. 

Greenville is a really huge county so if you‚Äôre considering it, I‚Äôd really do deep research as to what area you‚Äôre moving to because one side of Greenville is vastly different than the other side.

"Hello there!  So the fun part about South Carolina is there are a wide range of places / towns / geography.  You have the Lowcountry if you want to be near the ocean, Upstate if you love living near the mountains, I'm in the Midlands which is nice because I can get to either in a day trip.  Upstate has the cooler temps.. Midlands area has neither elevation or the ocean so it's the hottest part of the state.  Summers can be hotter than Florida, not unusual for a week of 100 plus 95% humidity.  People up north stay inside in the winters, we stay inside in July and August, LOL!  But our mild winters make up for it, we do get snow on occasion (had TWO snow events this year) and below freezing frequently.  But the daytime temps are mild enough.  Hurricanes are a real risk, if you live near the coast you definitely need to up the insurance.  Inland the risk is less and you don't get the evacuations, it's usually a tropical storm by the time it hits the Midlands area.  I've lost count of how many of those I've been through.  You learn to be prepared for wind, flooding and possible power outages.  Don't buy in a flood zone!  We do get wildfires on occasion around the state, but the risk here is much much lower.  Probably because generally we get a lot of humidity here.  As for vegetable gardens, lots of that here!  Some areas are more rocky and have a lot of clay, but most of the state is great for growing.

As for locations, we're going through what a lot of other places are going through right now.. tons of development and the prices of houses have gone through the roof the last year or two.  Lexington area is nice to live, horrible traffic.  South Carolina lets developers build wherever, whenever and they don't have to help with improving the infrastructure so it's really getting bad in some areas.

"I grew up in Greer, went to school in Columbia, moved back to boiling springs, and work in Spartanburg. I frequent vacations on the coast so I know my way around. 

Lexington isn‚Äôt too bad. I‚Äôm not a fan of Columbia or anywhere around there. It‚Äôs way too hot, and not much to do. The downtown area is bad, will never be fixed due to the college lifestyle. But lake Murray is near Lexington which is fun, we have a lake house in prosperity and it‚Äôs beautiful.

"I agree on freedom, so long as said freedom does not infringe on others' freedom.  In this case, due to the affects on the mind, will and emotions, that contradicts others' freedom.  People literally do things when affected by these things that they would not normally do.  Personalities often become the exact opposite of their ""norm"".  They tend to lose all inhibitions.  I've known folks personally affected on both sides.  In the past 5 years I guess, I forget exact timeframe, a family lost their high school senior to a drunk driver, if I recall correctly.  If booze were illegal, sure the man could have possibly have gotten his hands on it, but it would have been far more difficult, and at least perhaps that family would still have their son.  That's just one that I somewhat personally know.  Then I knew of relatives who would have been in far less trouble had they have never had the stuff.

My freedom should stop when it puts yours in jeopardy and vice versa.  And THAT is why I believe all that stuff should not be legal to buy/sell.

By the way, have you ever been to a town where it was illegal to sell alcohol?  I have.  It was just a small town in Mississippi, not perfect by any stretch, BUT as far as basic crime, traffic, etc, it seemed you had no legitimate worries.

I'm not worried about trying to have a theocracy.  That type government will not work with sinful men.  It will only work when Jesus rules during his 1,000 year reign, but that won't begin for *at least* another 7 years and some seconds, and nobody knows the exact date/time when any of those events will unfold.  I just know that there will be a rapture or calling away of the church, then 7 years of the Great Tribulation, then Jesus will come back, carry out the judgment of nations, and then begin his 1,000 year reign on earth.

"So, it's going to appear that those drivers are going really fast if you're in the other lane at a stand still or moving much slower. Drivers are supposed to move up until the lane ends to merge. 

If people merged at the very beginning of that lane, they would increase congestion in both the continuous (center) and merging (right) lane faster than if they moved up to the end of the merging lane and ""zippered"" into traffic. This is because those who are merging at the beginning of the merge lane are waiting for a driver to let them in (causing congestion behind the merging driver) and forcing drivers in the continuous lane to yield earlier than anticipated (causing congestion behind them). 

The zipper method doesn't prevent congestion but reduces the impact of congestion by increasing the distance between where people \*could\* technically merge and where they \*should\* merge.",t2_ijr9ba79,CLTCDR,0,1648728735.0,0,t1_i2u6e65,i2u6e65,False,RC123TheyCallMe,t3_ts7jfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/southcarolina/comments/ts7jfj/some_of_yall_need_a_visual_aid/,Some of y‚Äôall need a visual aid.,/r/southcarolina/comments/ts7jfj/some_of_yall_need_a_visual_aid/i2u6e65/,2,r/southcarolina,0,2

"how is that even a reply to him. he says its not just SC, its every state, and you complain you are from EU and then go back and say our insurance is high because it IS just SC.

ITS NOT JUST SC. Just accept you were wrong about that and move on. no reason to have a fit dude. They do do that in the EU? accept when they are wrong?

every state recommends the zipper, and every state has problems with drivers not doing it. Just deal with that fact. Maybe make constructive arguments on improving this, like actually having signs that say zipper merge rather than merge and hopefully our barely paying attention public will learn it. Either way take a chill dude and accept you were wrong that it is JUST SC.

Our insurance is partially high mainly because we have more drunk drivers than other states.

">empathy: the ability to understand and share the feelings of another

Lol, ""sense you seem"" to have not-a-fucking-clue what you're talking about, I would let you know that yes a I do have some insight into this world. 1) I've lived in Europe, where heroin was decriminalized in certain areas....which led to lower rates of overdose and death...specifically because it was de-stigmatized from being a criminal issue to being a health issue  2) I've been published under peer review on the subject.  So, I'd like to think some of what I say has some truth behind it.

>if there‚Äôs such a stigma around heroin, why even do heroin the first time?

This 100% displays that you have zero empathy.  This is literally the definition of not having empathy.  It shows that you actually cannot understand that people make mistakes, and can quickly become addicted to heroin/cocaine/alcohol/whatever.

>Go to a doctor, tell them you have a problem, and they will happily help you get on your feet again.

Once again, because like I said you didn't understand when I said it the first time, people who are addicted to ILLICIT substances are FAR less likely to seek help for fear of legal trouble.  This is documented.  This has been shown to be a reason why people seek help in countries that DE-STIGMATIZE drugs like heroin.  100% an instance where your beliefs don't match up to what actually happens in the world.

"The problem is when you introduce humans to the situation.  I encounter this every day, leaving downtown Greenville on I-185 S getting onto I-85 S.  At 5PM, I85 is usually slowed down (needlessly; it's just an unfortunate confluence of a major on ramp, a major exit in a mile, and everyone staring into the setting sun going uphill).  

Point is, youve got: 

A. some people jumping across the triangular ""not a road"" to go ahead and get on I85. 

B. people who feel like it's not fair to pass a ton of people just to go all the way to then end of the on-ramp (that's actually half me) 

C. people who don't want to die getting run over by a semi truck so they get in wherever they can (thats also half me)

D. People attempting a proper zipper merge, I guess

E. BMW drivers who fly past everyone at 90 MPH, pass the end of the converging lane, and recklessly dart in front of someone from the shoulder and will likely kill someone some day.  

Maybe I'm wrong, but trying to do a zipper merge there simply does not feel right at all.  Maybe it's because the traffic isn't actually stopped but slowed down?  i dont know.

"It works the way it is supposed (on average) in several other states and countries. It only doesn't work when people start thinking for themselves and don't allow others to merge. That problem is compounded when people apply the same logic you just did and preemptively line up in the continuous lane, the ones in the merging lane see the cars lined up in one lane and almost none in the other. To get ahead they pass everyone in the continuous lane (stoking annoyance or other feelings of the drivers they pass) and merge at the point. At which others are not inclined to let them merge because they feel as the merging driver has ""cheated"" or misbehaved in some fashion.

The recommended way (as demonstrated in the post) is to provide a scenario that avoids this. Where people stay in the lane they are in until the merge point.

"I applaud the DMV for trying this but the hard truth is that the zipper method is only better when there is no human element. You‚Äôve got people on their phones, tractor trailers that change speed much slower than cars. 
I find it best to stay in the lane I‚Äôm in, if it‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs giving out I‚Äôll go as far as I can and then within 1/4 or so of the merge I will start looking for the opportunity to merge. 
If you run all the way up to the merge point you are asking for an accident. Honestly I think just mathematically the zipper makes no difference. Sure there are two lines that are shorter than one, but in the end you end up in a single lane with a finite speed. So it‚Äôs either 2 lanes going 5 mph or 1 going 10 mph that is twice as long. 

In the end you‚Äôll always have people who run to the end of the merge point and people who won‚Äôt let those people in.
