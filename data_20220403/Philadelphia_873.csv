"Story ahead: 

My older step sister invites me over to her first apartment in the big city as a young adult for the weekend; I'm 12 years old. I get there and she essentially locks herself in her bedroom with her addict boyfriend and they do drugs and have sex all weekend. 

At one point I was starving and found a Costco multi-pack of Rice-a-roni and a cans of sardines in tomato sauce- prolly given to her by my mom. I made 3 boxes of Rice a roni (no butter!- sad face!) and ate it all weekend with the sardines. I remember at the time thinking THIS IS FUCKING DELICIOUS!

When I went home, I lied  to my mom and made up a story of all the things we did in the city.

"Thanks for putting up this thread OP! 

I'm in Houston ( ex-Austinite), and have been considering moving to Philly. I have lots of family there, so go as much as I can. I'm just sick of the Texas state government,  the continued sprawl, and lack of decent public transit. Now that my property taxes in Texas are in line with what I'd pay I'm Pennsylvania,  it seems like less of a burden to move. 
I did make a long weekend trip up in February,  which reminded me of what true winters are like! Not the best, but then Philly doesn't have summer of hell that lasts from May to October.

I also think having proximity to cultural activities in NYC and DC, along with lots of varied scenery within a 5 hour drive would be nice.

"Other Thoughts:

* Every hider should have a flag of sorts, the seeker who finds them get's the flag.  Whomever has the most flags is the winner on the seeker side.
* I think just hide & seek is the wiser choice.  Any part of the Wissahickon would be unwise to run in and it may warrant extra attention if people are being chased by seekers.
* If there's more than a dozen or so players it would be wise to seek permission in the selected venue.
* An ""[olly olly oxen free](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olly_olly_oxen_free)"" type signal would be needed.  Perhaps both digital and a loud noise at ground zero, to call hiders back at the end of round.
* In order to gauge actual interest, perhaps setup a Google sheet for sign ups.

"My first thought, from the cover page rendering, is ""great, a bike lane that runs directly between areas for people to stand waiting. In other words, an area that will always be full of people standing around, preventing the bike lane from being passable.

Overall though, these seem like great improvements. The new accessible design of the trolleys seems like an all-around improvement, and adding a few extensions to link up the routes seems like an obvious move. 

I can see complaints about no longer having stops at every corner, particularly if the gap is longer than about two blocks, which is reasonable—it's very easy to envision the common situation where someone misses a trolley regularly because of being compelled to walk an extra block, whereas they would have made it if the stop had been at its original location. Ironically this will be the worst for people who need the new accessibility features, because they by definition can't move as fast. I'd be curious to see data on how much time is expected to be gained by reducing the number of stops. The best way to mitigate this problem would be to just run trolleys more frequently (especially late at night) which I sure hope is also in the plan.

Adding shelters to each stop is a no-brainer. Currently there are only a handful of bus shelters along all the outdoor sections of trolley track in the city. They even got rid of one at 53rd and Baltimore when they rebuilt the corner, with no apparent plans to replace it.

As for the problem of people parking on and otherwise blocking the trolley tracks...I don't see a solution there other than authorizing trolley drivers to issue parking tickets, with a hefty fine, in that situation.

Also, your rationale about Obama publicly denouncing Super PAC money while literally months later taking Super PAC money is a joke, dude. ""Well, he had no choice because the other team was doing it"" is actually kinda pathetic.

I bet you also think there's absolutely NOTHING wrong with Joe Biden's son suddenly becoming an artist and selling paintings anonymously for $200k without any kind of oversight or auditing, eh?

This is why I don't fuck with people who act like you. You have some kinda contrived answer for literally everything that you believe, and you use various technicalities and mental gymnastics to support your bull shit. In this case, that because the truth is only clear when one reads between the lines, it somehow absolves your team of any wrongdoing.

"Yes they definitely sell out every season. I think they keep a stock for in-person sales if you can reach someone on a phone. 

I usually pre-order around early winter when the sales open up and pick up in person. It’s a nice drive and a cool little farm. Plus the plants experience less stress as compared to shipping in the mail.

Edit:

Update I just called (got me interested now) and their answering machine says the farm is open for in person sales starting April 10. 

I emailed to see if they will have a reserve of live plants which show sold out online.

Replace ""window tinting"" with any other reason to fail inspection.  Places can and have lost their license do future inspections over that.

"I think a few things should be determined:  


1. **Date & Time**  \-  Preferably a non-holiday weekend, and mid-day.
2. **Location**  \-  The Wissahickon is huge, and it may be better to do this in an adjacent, smaller park.  Clifford Park, Andorra Meadow, or Carpenters Woods are good areas that are not as busy and have smaller boundaries then the greater Wissahickon.
3. **Rules**  \-  Is this straight hide & seek, or is it the kind where you need to make contact with the hider?  Basically is it hide & seek or hide, seek & tag?
   1. How long for hiding?
   2. How long for seeking?
   3. Extra camo allowed?
   4. Out of bounds hides (this related to the above HS or HST)?
4. **Communication**  \-  Dedicated Reddit communication?

"I pleased to see SEPTA openly promoting Trolley Modernization and I hope that they realize most of its aims.  It's a more worthwhile project than King of Prussia Rail.  That project is trying to force transit into an area that was built almost to repudiate the idea of transit, whereas Trolley Modernization will build upon long, deeply-rooted precedents.  

Some of its ambitions are quite impressive.  The proposed extension of Route # 15 to 69th Street could make an almost orphan line better integrated into the network.  Most of the proposals seem to be meant to close gaps in the network, which seems like an obviously good idea to me.  The new rolling stock that will accompany it and allow the trolleys to become accessible are an exciting prospect.  If all of this is realized, it might accomplish some appreciable gains for SEPTA's ridership and service.

I am worried, however, about the project, because it will require coöperation from the city and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, which have jurisdiction over the roadways that the trolleys travel over for most of their routes and sidewalks where the stops would be.  If they fail to act as needed, the resultant project will be significantly compromised.  There are a lot of political risks, especially from Philadelphia's feckless, cowardly and ineffectual government and the sociopathic traffic engineers who dominate PennDoT District 6. This program will probably entail lowering the number of trolley stops, which will speed service and the new stop configurations will probably require that some space for parking be eliminated.  Both will probably yield complaints from 'the community', *viȝ.* a few arrogant malcontents, who have tremendous influence in Philadelphia.

"I mean, with all the violence in the city that we deride on this sub, and the disruptive turds on loud toys, etc. We really should be celebrating this humble act of love (or ""love""?), shouldn't we?!?!

Hmmm... that gives me an idea... and I'm being serious here... Should we start a sub called /r/brotherlylove that highlights and celebrates the positives of this city?

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD from childhood trauma, along with associated Gen Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and can get very angry and/or sad about bad news - meaning I'm very sensitive to negativity. So, I need to be cautious about my in-take of news, but I'm inclined toward the negative because of my trauma. And in addition to being a resident of Philly since 2005, I've been teaching the entire time, so I'm exposed to lots of potentially depressing or upsetting news about the city and my kids. But in order to be not only the best teacher I can be, but also father, in addition to the most important of all - tending to my own shaky mental health - I need to cautiously cull my in-take of media... In sum, having a sub that highlights the multitude of positives in the city would be great for me, personally, as well as the general morale of the city.

"I'm not a Philly resident yet (less than three weeks baby!) but I'll share some of the places my wife and I experienced as visitors that led to us falling in love with Philly's food scene (and the city in general). We also checked out a lot of the spots others have mentioned and loved them too, but I haven't seen these mentioned yet:

- Sidewalk dining at Parc on a summer weekend night: Wonderful French bistro cuisine with great service right on Rittenhouse square. Great people watching as everyone strutted on by dressed to the nines. Might not be warm enough for the same kind of outfits but should still be busy on a Friday or Saturday by the end of April.
- Dinner at Vernick Food & Drink with appetizers at Friday Saturday Sunday (no reservation at the former so we waited at the latter until a table was ready).
- Great food & tasty cocktails from a knowledgable mixologist at Abe Fisher.
- Grab-and-go (or stay, it's cute and casual) brunch at Talula's Daily on Washington Square (pop over if you're strolling Independence Mall in Old City), right next to Talula's Garden as mentioned by /u/mexicancitywide.

"I hear that. I’m near scofield farms/Wells Branch area. It’s standard 90s housing here and pretty much around average cost house in the Austin burbs. I feel like riding the market out here as long as possible is the best move - I read an article the other day that our market has a 0% chance of losing money for 10 years. And even though prices are going up everywhere, Philly doesn’t have the scarcity we have and won’t grow nearly as fast as our market. Once I move to Philly, Im not gonna have quite the same appreciating asset. I know that sounds shitty, but it’s literally one of like three things keeping me here. 

But mostly, I think we’re just ready for a change. My wife and i have been here in Austin about 10 years each and although we’ve loved our time here we’re in a different place in life now then we were in our mid-20s (+ college for me).

"I never thought I'd be a cider guy but yea, this spot is really good. Across the street is Punchbuggy Brewery and around the corner is New Liberty Distillery. They're all within like a 3 minute walk from eachother so you can bang out some cider tastings, a couple beers, and a flight of whiskeys within an hour. If it's a nice day, you can also walk 10 minutes east to Evil Genius Brewing, one of the best and highly rated breweries in Philly. From there, go a block over to Frankford Ave and work your way south. There's some good spots to eat and cute little shops. La Colombe is a really good coffee spot and if it's warmer out, go to Frankford Hall. It's a German style beer hall with a big open area in the back. You can also head a little futher south to Barcade where you can drink and play vintage arcade games. These are all in the Fishtown neighborhood.Heritage a nice spot in the Northern Liberties neighborhood for food and live entertainment and in Center City on Tues nights, there's open mic at Time where you can catch some good music.

">It’s better to have a non-progressive D than a R, especially if it keeps McConnell out of power. Of Lamb gets elected there’s at least the chance of progressive legislation happening, if it goes R then nothing gets passed. 

Three decades of Corporate Democrat stonewalling legislation says otherwise. I agree that Republicans are an existential threat, but Lamb is sympathetic to much of the Republican ideology. People like Lamb *enable* Republicans by refusing to truly hold them accountable. Corporate Dems kills the party's enthusiasm time and time again. Dems need a super majority to really transform society, but that will never happen with radical centrists like Lamb in the party and running the party. We all see the polling - Dem ideas are really popular, but no one believes the party actually wants to do those things (because they don't). People like Lamb are the reason people don't trust the Dems. 

>The Supreme Court is not a conservative supermajority because progressives wouldn’t hold their nose and vote for someone they don’t like and that’s likely going to cause huge damage to civil rights.

I don't know how you can look at Clinton/Obama/Gore/Kerry/Hillary/Biden and say 'We need more of that.' We'll just end up losing with more of the above, or with more Lamb.

Zahav- getting a reservation can be like hitting  the lottery, but if your internal clock is cool with eating at early or late times (for us) maybe you’d get lucky. They also have bar seating with happy hour beginning at 5:00 - line up at the door 4:20-4:30, grab a seat, and you’re in for a seriously good food experience.

Gastropubs- we have a bunch of good bars serving very good food. The vibe is very casual, and might be worth a stop. I really like Good Dog or Standard Tap. Hope you have a blast here.

Breakfast- we have some places that’s are very strong for breakfast.

"Nice, but paints a rosy picture and not really the full picture of Philadelphia. I love the city as much as the next guy, but we really do have a lot of issues. I’ve lived in CC, south Philly, and now Fishtown. I understand looking with endearment at the incompetence of the city but I just don’t really like that - the corruption and incompetence, if fixed, could improve the lives of the 1M+ that live here in a big way. I feel it should be looked at with more than an apathetic endearment. 

Also, feel like there were a lot of slants against people that live in the burbs. Doesn’t seem justified, not everyone in the burbs fits the nimby/waspy archetype that is being implied.

"Legit this, man. I wish more people understood that you can't just LET people do this kinda shit to you. Like the lady in the thread a couple weeks ago who said she let a lady pick through her purse in broad daylight. Like, c'mon.

Listen, OP, if you see this... I understand that life is unfair. I understand that people from Toronto can't fight for shit. I understand that NOBODY wants this kinda shit happening them, and that in a perfect world everyone would have some security guards or septa police or actual cops here to keep shit straight. 

But this isn't a perfect world, and while Philadelphia as a city is fuckin' awesome, it's also nowhere near squeaky clean. 

Your recourse is that you have no recourse. You can make a report with the SEPTA police and they'll file it and it'll give you some peace of mind but they won't do anything. 

People absolutely hate hearing this, but the onus of keeping yourself safe in a weird and troubled world is solely on you, and the sooner you understand that — and genuinely accept and take it to heart — the better off you'll be. 

You don't wanna fight? Or get wrapped up in some goofy shit with some random weirdo? I COMPLETELY understand that. But that means you should also probably Uber or call a cab.

And before all the soft-hands from the suburbs or NYC hop in here on some, ""PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SHOULD BE SAFE FOR EVERYONE"" shit, you're preaching to the choir. But remember: No matter how angry you are at my reply or how loud you are in these comments, it's not gonna change the reality of the situation.
