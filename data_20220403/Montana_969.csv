"I definitely rely on the naive whenever I want to start a meaningful dialogue.  I’d become really familiar with the issue before starting a community.

Sometimes a loud ignorant take even if absolutely correct can become a political liability and talking point reinforcing public opinion against common sense and decency.  Politics requires capturing hearts and minds and being informed by retards and sheisters has become a matter of pride for a LOUD 30% of Americans.

You’re not wrong about rampant exploitation and the need for change.  

I fear you’d be shocked should you dive into the details how far the divide is between what’s right, what’s legal and what it costs to take up action in a legitimate case of bad practice.

Seems to be little political will to increase access to civil courts by the poor, regulation to enforce and consequences to deter.  

I’m not familiar specifically here, but the statutes should be available and most states list of rights of renters but the statutes spell out the Devils in the details.

You could do allot of good educating others, especially the young of what their rights are and try and coalesce a local political movement to solve the political problem causing this.  

I would be careful about cultivating even reasonable and worthy outrage without a clear path towards solution and a sense of how a motivated and monied opposition could embarrass the cause.

Antiwork and BLM etc could do very well to consider this.  Neither seems saavy politically and both are being blunted by lack of fundamental communication of their principles and goals.  Everyone is aware of problems.  Find solutions.

I really wish there was public funding to help fund adequate legal representation for the poor and exploited and that enforcement caused meaningful hardship to the profiteers.",t2_cr6yc,Imnotmeareyou,0,1648955884.0,0,t1_i36if0o,i36if0o,True,redditisforpedossss,t3_tutkwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/tutkwk/would_anyone_be_interested_in_rreportlandlords/,Would anyone be interested in r/reportlandlords,/r/Montana/comments/tutkwk/would_anyone_be_interested_in_rreportlandlords/i36if0o/,-3,r/Montana,0,-3

"519 Skyles Place, whitefish MT

Well, I was looking for housing in the northern flathead valley. the only way I got a place (this place) was by applying without seeing it. And infact, it wasn't built at the time. I was given a list of types of rooms I could apply for with floor plans.

So whatever. that is more about rolling dice and I was the only way I found a place to live.

I end up with the worst room possible. No doubt. It isnt the floor plan I wanted and it isn't in the building I would have preferred.

When I was signing the lease, I was a little taken aback by the type of rules. It really didn't allow you to store stuff on your balcony or display any thing different unless it was for holidays. And there was a rule when you had to have your holiday stuff down. It just felt like some crappy thight-ass HOA

 But the kicker was my property manager lived below me.

 I immediately didn't like that and I also got really bad vibes from here in our first interaction. 

She got visibly annoyed with me for asking for her to re-explain how the doors of the building were meant to operate.

So of course because I'm above her she continually says I'm being too loud. I can make noise, but I'm a single guy in a studio. It's not like I was having parties. I had am office chair that was insanely loud because of the design of the floor, which I went out of the way to dampen the noise. Apparently it was never enough and was always too loud.

one night where I am walking in the dark and knocked something over. When I get back to my room, she is baning on the ceiling at me. And I'm not sorry at all that I banged right back, because that is just how you piss me off, not actually try to communicate.

I got a noise complaint which I then went and decided I'd give her one to since she was banging on the ceiling.

I didn't talk to her until I was moving out. By then, we had a different property manager for some reason. I have no idea if it was from the situation between her and I or whatever. 

The new property manager was great! But that didn't change the bad experience and it was way overpriced for how terrible it was and how obvious it was that the owners had told the property managers to spend as little as possible.

I moved out and had to pay to leave early. But now I am in a 3 bedroom 2 bath and barely pay more than I was at the studio. My property manager is great too.

TLDR;
I lived directly above my property manager and, of course, it didn't go well. The owners were not taking care of their brand new apartment complex. I was overpaying for what it was for sure.

I would say avoid these companies that are obviously out-of-state real-estate companies. Definitely MT specific.

If the rules for the apt complex are too different from the normal culture, then it probably isn't good. this place felt like a bad HOA.",t2_2fz2ab1,cbeiser,0,1648937011.0,0,t1_i35nkdb,i35nkdb,False,redditisforpedossss,t3_tutkwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/tutkwk/would_anyone_be_interested_in_rreportlandlords/,Would anyone be interested in r/reportlandlords,/r/Montana/comments/tutkwk/would_anyone_be_interested_in_rreportlandlords/i35nkdb/,4,r/Montana,0,4

"My wife and I are retired and spend half the year in Red Lodge Montana and the other half in rural North Idaho. We are out on the trails approximately 40 -60 days a year. We have seen  black bears 5 times at distance in NI, and 1 Griz at distance in a REMOTE lake. We have seen 0 Griz and 0 Black bears in and around the Beartooths and Cabinets. Many of these are less traveled trails and 6-10 miles out. We carry bear spray, always have bear bells on our packs. If we see recent scat or tracks, we make our presence known in those areas. Yeah, I get the handgun comfort argument and see a ton of folks packing them, seemingly mostly on the popular trails in high traffic trailheads with the fam hiking the 2 miles to a scenic spot, with non stop hiker traffic both ways. IMHO, unless your packing a Griz stopper handgun like the Alaskans use, you would just piss a Grizz off with your 40's . I used to sell big bore bolt and double rifles to Safari Hunters and studied stopping power data on dangerous game.  So according to the 'data' I can pass along. Thats 4 black bear sightings 1 Griz sighting and 0 encounters in what I would guess is 500+ outings.

">Carry .454 CasullEdit: for those downvoting me

I downvoted you because it's shitty advise, especially when it's given to someone of unknown experience. While .454 Casull looks good on paper,  few people can shoot that wrist-buster well. And if it hurts to shoot, they won't practice with it, which makes it a liability to carry.

Bear spray is much easier for a novice to deploy and doesn't require precise aim.  Studies have shown it to be more effective at deterring bear attacks and results in fewer human injuries.

People who chose to carry firearms for bear defense should choose the largest caliber they can shoot well and will practice with regularly. Even then, it should be coupled with bear spray, not used as an alternative. The only time I would reach for my sidearm over bear spray is in high wind.

"What did I get wrong? I'm back and forth to Montana at least once a month traveling all over the state. Most people are recommending Yellowstone, as did I. But there is little point in OP traveling to Glacier that time of year. Yes it's pretty but it's a long way up there and when you think of an epic US road trip that takes a lot of time with, IMO, minimal reward in the winter. Colorado has taller mountains, and a more robust year-round tourist industry that is likely to appeal to a wider range of people while being more convenient for getting to other destinations. Go skiing in Aspen one day next day you can be in Moab. If you go skiing in Whitefish where can you drive to for the next day? Great Falls? I love the sip n dip as much as the next guy (haven't been since Pat passed away, not sure what its like with the new guy) but I'm not sure if I'd rank it above Moab. 

There's a lot of beauty in Montana but winter access is limited, travel can be difficult, and it's a long way from other major tourist destinations. Makoshika would be worth a stop, for example, but it's such a drive to get there for an extremely small winter experience.

"Anthony Bourdain, God rest his soul, found Waffle House inspiring. He merely loved Livingston. And one or two restaurants in Livingston does a resume for foodies make.

It produces wonderful beef, but few restaurants in Montana knows how to properly season it (with the exception of the Thirsty Turtle in Big Timber and Sir Scott’s Oasis in Manhattan.

Highlights compared to what I have found in other states is a short list:

* Lefse from Granrud's near Opheim
* Eugene's Pizza in Glasgow and Biga Pizza in Missoula
* Pasty's from Joe’s Pasty Shop in Butte and Lisa’s Pastry Pantry in Missoula
* Baked goods from the ~~Polebridge Mercantile in Polebridge (huckleberry turnovers)~~, Wild Flour Bakery & Cafe in Emigrant (maple bars), IGA in Havre (Boston cream donuts), and Sun Dog Coffee Co. in Harlowton (huckleberry and blueberry muffins)
* Sandwiches from the Staggering Ox in Helena
* Zucchini bread from the Springdale Hutterite Colony for sale in White Sulphur Springs in the summer
* Fry Bread from the Crow Fair
* Flathead cherries
* Scones from the Great Northern Fair in Havre
* Tea from In Cahoots For Tea in Great Falls
* And my other favorite restaurants for no particular reason at all: Burger Dive in Billings, Ox Pasture in Red Lodge, Saketome Sushi in Big Fork, and Cafe Madriz in West Yellowstone

Helena - Thai at the place in the gulch downtown (can’t recall the name).

Big sky - the wrap place in the village.

Bozeman - lots of spendy places, but stop at the pickle barrel.  The fried chicken place is very good too.  There used to be an amazing wrap place with a great dirtbag vibe but I think they closed.

Manhattan - sir Scott’s oasis.  Old fashioned Montana steakhouse.  If you go one place for steak go here.  Get an order of steak fingers as an appetizer.

Willow creek - the cafe used to have the best ribs in the state, but there is now a new owner.  I haven’t been there since the new owner took over.

Dillon - the taco bus (or salsa’s).

Billings - there used to be a good Indian restaurant there but I don’t know if it’s still there.

Livingston - rib and chop house is pretty good but so is the little shop next to the Murray.

Big timber - sandwich shop on the main drag is pretty darn good.

Kalispell - I’m not sure I’ve actually ever had a good meal in Kalispell..  but if you are up near glacier the Essex trains station has decent food but you won’t find better atmosphere.

"I love Montana in the winter time but I live here and don’t have to worry about the attendant long term travel considerations.  As long as you don’t run into any major storms, which is always a possibility, and stay on major roads and use common sense, you should be fine with a front wheel drive and good snow tires. Bear in mind that most winer activities are focused on snow sports - x-country and downhill skiing and snowmobiling.  Another factor many people don’t consider is the long nights.  Depending on when you’re here, it can be dark before 5 pm and remain so until nearly 8:00 am.  That’s a lot of night.  And while it’s generally overblown, it can get real cold - below 0F is not at all unusual.  Be sure to have a winter survival kit in your car.

If you have time since it’s a bit out of they way, the northern road in Yellowstone Park is open all year to Cooke City, MT.  It’s a wonderful drive
through a winter wonderland teeming with wildlife.  You can always rent x-country skis or snowshoes locally to enhance the experience.

"Sounds like a fantastic trip.  I would probably avoid any place around NE part of the country and the great lakes because those places get awful ice/snow storms.  Here in Montana, the storms are much dryer.  We still have slick roads and snow, but nothing at all like the eastern part of the U.S.  I don't know if you live in an area in N.Z. that has snowy winters or not, but if you like to snow-ski/board, etc., I would recommend visiting - there are a number of spots that have ski areas nearby and the neighboring towns in the valleys can have milder (comparatively) weather.  I live in the Bitterroot Valley, just south of Missoula, and our winters are much milder than the rest of the state, but there are two ski areas at either end - one just north of Missoula and one at the southern end of the valley.  If you're not into winter sports, I don't know that visiting here would be that great during that time frame, unless you just want to hang out someplace for a few days.  If you can afford it, you can stay in Yellowstone Park and I think it would be gorgeous in the winter (never done it myself, but it's on my bucket list) - they have snow cats that take you on tours, etc.

If you are so inclined to see some wonderful winter in the northern part of the country may I suggest a multi day snowmobiling trip into Yellowstone. It's a little pricey but it's worth it. It's an amazing way to see Yellowstone and there will be limited people in the park. You could do that out of west Yellowstone or from the south of the park through Jackson Wyoming. I've worked with a wonderful company that does it and it's truly amazing. If you want any details feel free to DM me. As far as driving goes just be safe and don't speed.

"You're welcome! I'm incredibly jealous that you'll be able to get so much time away and are able to travel. Don't get me wrong, Montana is great with wonderful people but for general tourism in the winter I'm not sure it would be high on my list of must-see states. Wyoming has Yellowstone that is worth seeing, if you can get a snow coach tour to old faithful that's worth doing, and maybe you'll just dip into a bit of Montana to do that. If you want to do some hunting then Montana makes more sense to me.

What would you want to see in Montana? The major attraction I believe tends to be Glacier National Park but access is limited when you'll be here. Colorado offers more mountain experiences with better access in the winter months. Colorado also doesn't tend to be so far out of the way with Utah being another good place to visit right next door.

"It is safe in the winter as long as you’re prepared for it. Use Montana 511 to get road conditions and generally interstate and US highways will be plowed the most. It’s also good to keep an extra blanket or two in your vehicle during the winter months. It is a good idea to carry a small survival kit in the vehicle and to fill up your vehicle more often. My rule of the thumb in the winter is to not let my fuel tank go below half full. 

One thing you can do if you do decide to travel in northern states is find an empty parking lot that is snow packed and learn how your vehicle responds in slick conditions. As always just give yourself more space when driving in bad conditions.

"  If money is no object, then Bozeman is the place to be.  

But, if you can't drop 750 grand for a house, then here's some thoughts:

1)  Butte.  You can still get a reasonably priced house and still enjoy the benefits of one of our larger towns.  On the downside is the winters, which can be a bit brutal to the uninitiated.  

2)  Glascow.  Medium sized town that has a great atmosphere and is extremely affordable.  Downside is the winds on the hi-line can get annoying.

3)  Miles City.  Smaller town that is in a great location with easy access to Billings for shopping.  It gets hot in the summer, and the wind blows here as well.

4)  Anaconda.  One of the coolest towns in the state.  Plus, access to every place real easy.  Cold  and snowy in the winter, but an awesome, medium sized town.

5)  Deer Lodge.  Our state prison is here.  If that doesn't bother you, this is another nice medium to small sized town.  Easy access to either Missoula or Butte as well.

Lastly, don't overlook the dozens of 'tiny' towns that dot our state.  You would be surprised how open and warming tiny towns can be.  They are very affordable and most should welcome you and your family.

"How many charging ports are they going to have per station? How much will they cost to use? Will there be stalls compatible with trucks towing trailers?

Also, this says it's going to be 50 miles as a 'guideline', where are you seeing ""no more than 30 miles apart"": https://www.eenews.net/articles/biden-admin-details-first-contours-of-ev-charging-network/

Lastly, this article details the VW Dieselgate + Electrify America investment, which totalled $5 billion in charging infrastructure: https://www.morningbrew.com/emerging-tech/stories/2022/02/23/four-top-ev-charging-companies-on-their-plans-to-win-federal-funds - so $5 billion created quite a few stations, but didn't come even remotely close to doing so every 30 miles even on a single freeway route. Why would $5 billion more (the amount in the infrastructure bill you referenced dedicated to public EVSE) suddenly do that, especially when costs of construction have greatly increased?

I'd wager that it would cost more than $5 billion for Montana alone to install an ample number of 150kW chargers at 30 mile intervals on all interstates, considering many of those locations would be miles away from the nearest service lines capable of pushing 150kW x 10? 20?",t2_h92163ng,RingoTheFisherman,0,1648592373.0,0,t1_i2mj9nr,i2mj9nr,False,FastidiousFalcon,t3_tr3r2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/tr3r2c/diesel_costs_record_high_in_montana/,Diesel costs record high in Montana,/r/Montana/comments/tr3r2c/diesel_costs_record_high_in_montana/i2mj9nr/,0,r/Montana,0,0

"Missoula used to have a naked bicycle race every year. Perfectly legal, public, and right through downtown.

I think you're wise to be concerned about cops' understanding of the law though, they generally don't know shit about nuance (I'm a former criminal defense attorney).

Whether you will get a ticket for indecent exposure is largely going to depend on context. Are you an older male with a chub next to a playground with a bunch of kids in it? Likely to get a ticket and potentially a conviction, regardless of what your subjective intent is (subjective intent is almost never the standard in the law, a judge/jury would look at the objective circumstances to decide what your intent was). Are you on a largely secluded beach nude sunbathing? Likely not to get a ticket, and even more unlikely to get a conviction.

I had a case where some young female missionaries were walking through an apartment building doing what they do and came across a slightly ajar front door, knocked, looked in as the door swung open and saw a guy openly masturbating. He invited them in and covered himself, they called the police. He ultimately got convicted (imo was more about his personality/looks than the facts), but a different jury/judge could have easily found him not guilty.

"You're so caught up and obsessed with identity and party politics that you didn't even read my comment. I very clearly acknowledged that Biden made changes that impacted the price of oil. 

Biden only shut down the Alaska leases that Trump granted in a wildlife refuge. The north slope is still very much alive and well. 

Again, Biden did make changes that impacted the price of oil but the Keystone XL pipeline was never operational, so trying to point to it being stopped as reasoning for oil prices increasing makes no sense. Most of the leases that Trump granted in Alaska weren't even operational when Biden shut them down, so again, it doesn't make sense to use this as a cause for increasing prices either.

Regarding Keystone XL: instead of sending oil from Canada through a pipeline to be refined in the US we are alternatively going to have international oil tankers import oil to the US that burn diesel fuel in order to transport it? How is this good for the environment?

The US has enough oil to not import any oil. Instead we buy oil from questionable refined that support genocide in places like Yemen.

"While I definitely agree that elections and politicians can impact oil prices I'm not sure if it's fair to compare the oil prices in 2020 when he won or January 2021 when he took office to where they are now. Covid drove oil prices down lower than they'd been in nearly 20 years, so low that it became unprofitable for American drilling / fracking to continue so an entire industry was essentially wiped out within a matter of days. This happened under Trump.  

Not only that but Russia being sanctioned for a war we have nothing to do with also drove oil prices up instantly to levels we haven't seen since 2008, when a republican was in office. 

I don't like Biden, I think our entire political system needs an overhaul in a major way but I also don't buy into the narrative that Biden and Biden alone drove oil prices up to where they are today.

The 406 area code can support 8 million unique numbers, only 36% of them are currently used.  The reason we're going to ""run out"" is because of the way they allot them to areas.  Since most people now use mobile numbers, it's not so important that phone numbers in specific towns share the second set of 3 numbers.

So it's just a matter of having those unused but allotted numbers released to be used in other geographic areas.

"Unless you're showing up with $800k to buy a 800sg ft starter home, dream about how a designer cowboy hat worn to brunch makes you a ""Montanan,"" or are in some other way looking to cosplay life as a rancher while in your parents's SUV on your way to the ski lifts, then there's not really an all in one ""things to know"" secret.

The secret really is just to put in some time living here. Show you got a little bit of grit amd the ability to read the room to either adopt some ""Montana"" ideals, or not. What those are vary from person to person, but generally it includes a spirit of helping one another that is borne within communities that live in extreme environmental challenges (for example: winter will literally kill you).

Also...look around on this subreddit...Montana is going through HELLACIOUS high speed gentrification right now so there's a palpable sense that, at least for the time being, people who live here are not enthused at more people moving here no matter what their job is or how nice they are.Look up rental vacancy rates for a quantifiable metric of why that is.

But also...maybe because you seem to have fallen in love with Great Falls, none of that matters and the community would be happy to have you?

"Hey there! That’s how I used to feel until I talked to a brave dog, a traditional(religious) man who followed the Blackfeet ways along with my dad. He said “we were all born here and we all care for this land. We must work together to maintain its beauty and keep the creatures of its land healthy. This is what truly matters and what happened to our ancestors was terrible, but that wasn’t us who went through the worst and that it wasn’t them that did that to our people. They may come from them, but a lot of them do not have the same intentions that their ancestors did.”

"You aren't kidding. That was the coldest part of the year in a Ram 1500 with 3.92 gears using winter gas, driving around 20 miles a day in deep snow for about six weeks straight in four wheel drive. You have to understand, they do not use salt just a sort of sand gravel mix in the corners and at stop lights for traction. They plow but leave a few inches of snow on the roads. You get used to it and it just is the way it is... You don't go speed limits most of the time, you just plod forward. That same year, within a few weeks of the pic, on my road home, the plows had created four foot high berms on the side of the road. Someone hit a deer and part of it was laying on top of the berm for like two days frozen solid and the birds were at it. I was coming home and a Golden Eagle was on the carcass pecking at it. It was HUGE. So, the eagle is like three feet from the side of my truck as I drive by. I went slowly by and it didn't like it so it spread its wings giving me what I took for a dirty look staring straight at me. The wing spread was about as wide as my truck was long...only a slight exaggeration... 

Aside: I once saw a Golden (bigger than bald eagles) sitting on top of a large round hay bale in a field as the sun came up. It was sitting with its back to the sun and had its wings spread out across the bale with the ends over the side of the ends of the bale. Now most city people don't get that visually, but sometime when you are traveling across the country, take a hard look at how big those bales of hay are... Be in awe of the bird... One web site notes: ""The largest balers make bales nearly 8 feet wide by 6 feet in diameter."" 

It is why four wheel drive or at least all wheel drive is not a luxury or gimmick item. So, just more reasons to consider carefully before moving here. Some winters, it lasts from October to sometime in April. Mostly, you can count on January and February being like I described above. And then...there's the highline... Think up where the bakken is... You drive and drive and drive and the roads may seem clear because the wind has blown the feets of snow for days on end, but those roads are a trap as the wind and vehicles polish the snow into black ice and in some cases it is as far as the eyes can see and in the east...well, there is a reason they call it ""big sky."" Think about it... Pretty much from the great lakes to the Montana mountains in the northern tier of states, straight flat, forever... and temps like on my dash...

"Id argue that it is a hard thing to study because of the rarity of the event and the lack of data. The most available study here includes less then ninety spray encounters over a twenty year period - not a whole lot to work with. 

Practice with the firearm you carry. There are training scenarios for this specifically. The beauty of using a large bore is that you dont need to hit the nervous system or spinal column. The amount of force behind a .500 is truly crushing. If you can't reliably train with and carry a heavy firearm, sure, carry mace.

"It’s not a particularly hard thing to study. It’s more of an accounting of actual bear encounters. And it shows that people who use bear spray correctly almost always survive a bear attack.

People who rely on a gun, have a 50/50 chance of dying 

Why? 

Because chances are, when a giant ass bear is barreling down on you, your ability to accurately hit such a target is massively harder than you’re imagining it to be. And you do need to be accurate as hell, and hope you land an instant kill shot. Because you won’t have a second chance.

And if you weren’t successful, you just increased the odds the bear is going to kill you. There’s a reason they tell you to cover up and play dead - and it’s because of bear behavior. 

But yes, I’m sure you know more than everybody whose ever looked at it seriously. I’m sure the people who literally work with grizzly bears as a profession, don’t know what they’re talking about. 

By the way, there are plenty of people who care about the animals and bears. Just because you’re someone who doesn’t, doesn’t mean someone an idiot or naive for accepting the risks that go along with co-existing with other living creatures. Especially when there’s easy, safe, demonstrated methods that keep both myself, and bears, safe.

We moved out of his line and towards the cover of the trees, and he just bee lined straight to where we had all been standing and then straight into the forest as if none of the trees even existed, making an insane amount of racket as small branches broke off as he moved through.

"Avid hiker here, and I've been to at least 4 Bear Aware clinics and have talked with bear pros.  The NUMBER ONE  thing  you can do to prevent a bear attack is to make your presence known while hiking, no bears in sight.  Most attacks are said to be surprise, when you are downwind from a bear so she can't smell you.  To make your presence known, it's recommended you hike with at least one other person, preferably 3 or 4. Your voices and scent are usually enough to make a bear just wander off. It's the lone hiker or biker (last year it was a guy on a bike, near Big Sky, as well as a lone hiker) that likely caught the bears off-guard and that's when there's an attack. You may think you're quick with your gun, but I guarantee that grizzly is WAY quicker. Same with bear spray.  Both are useless if you just walked around the bend into a previously unassuming bear.  Magnify that threat if she's with her cubs or her fresh kill.  So the KEY is to let the bears know you and your friends are around long before you see them.  But let's say you guys see a bear down the trail.  Gun or bear spray?  Experts say bear spray.  Have it ready while backing away, no eye contact.  It charges?  Bear spray covers a WIDE RANGE, a nice cloud of irritant.  Gun?  Well, you may have hit it (if you're lucky, with your shaking hands, which you are going to have) angering it more.",t2_4862ccrg,MoonieNine,0,1648408253.0,0,t1_i2cipdh,i2cipdh,True,etiennesurrette,t3_tpl59v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/tpl59v/bear_country_question_ive_always_meant_to_ask/,Bear Country Question I've Always Meant to Ask,/r/Montana/comments/tpl59v/bear_country_question_ive_always_meant_to_ask/i2cipdh/,8,r/Montana,0,8

"It’s a TV show. I enjoy it because I take it for what it is. That being said, and I know plenty of locals who will shit on me for saying this, but the fact is that it has stimulated the local economy where the ranch is and for the rest of the state. People were moving to Montana in droves before the bloody tv show came out, and will be after the tv show is finished. 

Land prices have been driven up. But here’s the thing. It took local Montanans selling the land in the first place to make it available for “outsiders.”  People from other states moving here who have made much more money than the average Montanan will spend much more money here than the local Montanan. Hopefully that stimulates the economy. I hope in a decade that the wages will keep up with the increase in cost of living. Montana has been way behind that for many years. Either way.

"Clever rhetorical gambit.

Here's my response.

It's not capitalism I dislike. It's you.

You, personally. You as a person. You are the problem.

You make decisions and take actions that put your own personal gain above the good and future of our community.

Treating homes as commodities to be traded at the highest possible turnover, you're merely extracting value from the community and culture without doing anything to produce it.

You're a strip miner. An eater. You're the guy who builds a chemical plant next to the daycare. Who'd put a casino and gas station in the Lamar Valley.

You don't value Montana except for the wealth you can extract from it. That's not capitalism, capitalism is merely a mechanism. What you do with that mechanism, however, speaks volumes about your character.

"I almost always carry a Glock 20 10mm on my chest whether bow hunting, hiking with my family or fishing in brown bear country. With hard cast bear loads and a 2nd clip accessible. I carry it with me when I am rifle hunting as well just to be safe.

I think alot of the hikers around Bozeman are somewhat naive. I often see them without even bear spray in brown bear country in the Gallatin Custer forest.

When I was younger we would go hiking in remote Alaskan wilderness without guns or bear spray but most the other hikers all had shotguns with them for bears. This was on a family vacation and our host was anti gun. So I've done quite a bit of hiking in Bear country without anything to protect myself as well. We would see grizzlies but never closer than about 150 yards.

I've also been fly fishing in Katmai and had big boar grizzlies walk within 10 yards of me while I was waist deep in the river fishing. Was quite creepy but those bears are supposedly not aggressive towards humans

Dude. Racism is alive in rural MT. I’m from here but my Hispanic wife (white-ish passing) was opening a bank account on her first week in this small SW MT town and the banker openly said she drives all the way to Helena (an extra 100 miles) bc there’s too many Mexicans at the stores when she needs to go shopping in Bozeman. She actually pays extra to be racist.  The examples of American Indians “getting drunk and paid by the government to be Indian” mentioned at her job by other staff come to mind. Endless comments about how MSU basketball/football teams are full of boys that don’t look like they’re from around here. I can go on. The point is hate speech and white supremacy is commonplace here and avoiding that reality to leave it to fester by saying it’s getting better or is non-existent is not the same as participating in any woke or cancel mob.,t2_bggkg,GMane2G,0,1648389935.0,0,t1_i2bbwu4,i2bbwu4,False,Ember357,t3_tp0fzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/tp0fzr/recently_published_essay_in_trout_unlimited_hate/,"Recently published essay in Trout Unlimited, Hate Speech on the Bitterroot.",/r/Montana/comments/tp0fzr/recently_published_essay_in_trout_unlimited_hate/i2bbwu4/,3,r/Montana,0,3

"These are great points. And to be clear, I think you have to look at each organization individually, as well as each employee. For therapy, who your therapist is really matters. And of course good therapists are at both non-profits as well as for profits. 

My point is that in terms of quality of care to the client/patient, for profit is not inferior to non profit. As you said, that’s where the money is. They are going to have the best resources and best opportunities for employee growth and development (program paying for clinical trainings, smaller caseloads,etc). If it was my child, I’d much rather have her at a for profit program with all the bells and whistles, than a non profit cutting corners and overworking their people. 

But that’s the problem…. Because I’m a therapist, I’d never be able to afford a private pay program for my own child. It’s really for only the top 1%-5% of income earners who can afford it. And that means they can afford to pull their kid and take them elsewhere. So programs have to do a ton to keep clients. So as an operator and as a provider, I also prefer the “not for profit” or Medicaid clients. They are the “bottom” 95% of income earners. I’d prefer to not work with rich entitled parents with entitled kids. However, treatment in one of those for profit programs is probably better. Not in every case! But as a general rule. 

To be clear… I’m not saying it should be the way it is. I hate that only the top 5% get the “best” treatment. And as I started this comment, it really comes down to the person/people providing the care. They could be bad ir good, which you can find anywhere. But that is why i now work with a broader clientele and primarily insurance funded. Trying to make “the best” (however you define that) treatment more accessible to everyone who needs it.",t2_4nmsi,MrJake10,0,1648352288.0,0,t1_i29vp7t,i29vp7t,False,ninjascotsman,t3_toggvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/toggvw/montana_is_sending_troubled_kids_to_outofstate/,Montana is sending troubled kids to out-of-state programs accused of abuse,/r/Montana/comments/toggvw/montana_is_sending_troubled_kids_to_outofstate/i29vp7t/,0,r/Montana,0,0

"I’ve never shot in the vicinity of a Grizzly, but I snapped a stick to persuade a griz to turn around TWICE (same bear, different mornings while elk hunting) and it worked both times. 

The bear was 100 yards away in an open field, flipping boulders to eat beetles. We weren’t afraid because he was minding his own and we had high powered rifles, but as soon as he started coming towards us, snapping one stick got his attention, snapping another convinced him to go back into the timber.",t2_207rxyca,so_easy_to_trigger_u,0,1648343389.0,0,t1_i29eq40,i29eq40,False,X-Files22,t3_toou9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Montana/comments/toou9q/montana_hiker_found_dead_after_suspected_grizzly/,Montana hiker found dead after suspected grizzly bear attack | CNN,/r/Montana/comments/toou9q/montana_hiker_found_dead_after_suspected_grizzly/i29eq40/,2,r/Montana,0,2

"I don’t know if I’d say spray is more effective than a 44.  In the 12 times that a 44 mag was used as self defense against a grizzly bear there was a 100 percent success rate. There’s been multiple times that bear spray has been deployed and there is not a one hundred percent success rate. Yes, use your spray first because it’d be a shame to kill it, but technically a 44 has a better chance of saving your butt.  I know people like to go on and on about how best spray is more effective, but the statistics paint a different picture.
