"I didn’t ignore it, I just couldn’t make sense of what you were trying to say. I don’t know of any commercial spaces in the Old Port that were selling for <300k. Even if there were a handful, lending dropped almost 70% in 2 years. Only established restaurant groups were getting loans big enough to fund real estate purchases. 

If you were talking about residential places? Sure, in 2022 the idea of Old Port properties selling for under 300k seems ridiculous. But banks lending requirements were so over the top conservative that put those properties out of reach for most people.

For illustrative purposes: In 2009, I was making 50k; I had 75k in student loans, and no other debts. By then I had been out of school for 2 years and had been paying $850/mo. for a place on Winter St. I couldn’t get a $100k loan for a condo. With HOA fees, my monthly costs would’ve been about $750/mo. - lower than what I had been paying.

"No, not really - Portland was relatively inexpensive before, during, and for a few years after the recession ended. Rents actually went up during the recession; food costs too. There was even a food shortage at the beginning of the recession, and for all I know there is a Reddit thread from that time in which people talked about the high price of lobster rolls.

If the recession had any impact on the Portland restaurant scene is that it lowered the barrier to entry to open a restaurant - with all the spaces available, my guess is a lot of talented restaurateurs we’re finally able to realize their ideas. 

Portland real estate feels like the upside down right now, and I’m sure that commercial lease hikes are partly responsible for how expensive it is to go out right now. But food costs and labor costs are really what’s driving the increases.",t2_l8me7cxq,broadcity606,0,1648985442.0,0,t1_i37nfao,i37nfao,False,CelebrationSea4019,t3_tuet9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/tuet9z/lobster_roll_price/,Lobster roll price,/r/portlandme/comments/tuet9z/lobster_roll_price/i37nfao/,1,r/portlandme,0,1

"Sure! A lot of this I picked up when I was house shopping, to try to learn as much as I could about the history of places before going to see them (and trying to guess why people were selling also). Also handy for looking up the exact tax info for a property since that's part of the public property records. I picked up more after *buying* a house so I could make sure the deed was recorded correctly and that our mortgage servicer was paying the tax bill correctly, etc.  

The City of Portland's website is pretty good and well organized but you do have to know what you're looking for in order to find the right departments. Cumberland County is also one of the counties in Maine that makes their deed database available online (not all of them do). 

The city assessor's database is usually a good start - that will get you owner info and parcel info, which you need for some of the other databases. From there, if you want more ownership information (liens or sell price or whatever), the county's database is a good place to start - the trick is that you can't search by address, so you need an owner's name or you already need to know the document details. 

In terms of permits, that's again on the city's website - they have pretty good, detailed instructions about how to find permit info depending on when it was issued (newer permits are in an online, easily searchable format, older ones may or may not be depending on their age and whether anyone has asked for them to be digitized from the city's microfiche records). I had never looked at permits before today but I knew they were at least semi-public, so I looked up the Permitting & Inspections Department and sure enough, they had an online search. 

Finally, good old fashioned Google can be helpful as well - it's not at all uncommon for a search for an address or business name to turn up details about a sale or planned use, etc. 

There's definitely other sources of public record out there (some of which are not free to search - there's quite a few on the State's website that fall into that category) - this is just the stuff I know about. A lot of this I just found by googling - it seems like most larger town's in Maine make their assessor's database available online, and Cumberland/Washington/Somerset counties have their registry of deeds searchable online (others may also, I know York County does not, I don't know about the rest of the state).",t2_746jy,ibor132,0,1648936676.0,0,t1_i35mvci,i35mvci,False,damon_matt_damon,t3_tukmb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/tukmb1/restaurant_opening_next_to_citgo_on_outer_forest/,Restaurant opening next to Citgo on outer Forest?,/r/portlandme/comments/tukmb1/restaurant_opening_next_to_citgo_on_outer_forest/i35mvci/,3,r/portlandme,0,3

"I've been wondering about this too - based on the permits that were pulled it sounds like it will be a restaurant of some sort.

Southeast side of the facility with an Ice Cream Store on the Northwest front corner area. ""

Based on the most recent activity (plumbing and electrical permits) it seems like a restaurant is still the plan, but it's not all that clear to me whether they actually have a tenant now and are doing the finish work accordingly or if the original renovation plan is still just being completed.

"I went out last weekend to Flask, Free Street, and Bubba's based on Reddit suggestions and here is my feelings, admittedly after only one real attempt to go out:

The Flask never really seemed to go off and it had more of a bar setup than a club.  I had planned to hit the retro night but nothing was really happening.

Free Street had all the elements to be a great club.  Big space, good atmosphere, and I was excited because there was an event called the 'Gathering of the Gandalfs' that looked fun.  But it also never went off to my disappointment but all it was missing was people.

Bubba's was packed and pretty lit dance floor but be prepared because it is more of a dive club.  It is kind of like an antique store that just shoved all the merch to the side and put in three light up dance floors.  Lots of weird mannequins staring at you.  I would have been weirded out if I hadn't been living in Alaska and Northwest Florida before here.  Also just some trash drunkards, really rude to the bouncers.  I showed up and somebody was getting kicked out while arguing they weren't too drunk when I came in and another person was doing the same as I left.

"The answer is royale in boston. 

Youve got old port clubs like oasis where most everyone is just standing around with a very limited amount of people dancing. Its a small venue and most locals see it as a total shit show. I dont mind it, mainly cause Ive met some decent flings there.

Flask lounge is smaller just outside of old port its not bad but is cramped.

Citrus is full of the non college party types its more of a white collar bar with live djs, than a dance club.

The pier in old orchard is meh aswell, but it does get hopping in the summer bit again the crowds just arnt big enough to have a good time dancing without being a sore thumb a lot of the time. Most of pur venues are just so small.


Honestly if youre lopking for a club party rave type dance scene portland aint it.

"This is the new normal.

It hit me a several months ago at the grocery store, when craft beer hit $12-$20 per 4-pack, I looked at my favorite and said, you know what, that's too much. So I quit drinking, no shit, it was time anyway, but the money I save is significant.

Same happened to me with restaurants, I'm a chef, I love restaurants and eating delicious food. Once prices got to be around $80-100 for two people to dine (without alcohol and before tip), it just got to be too much, so now I cook arguably better food for my wife and I at home, every night. I quit eating out, basically.

At some point the price gets to be too much and people just stop buying. This is where we are at now. It is like we live in The Magic Kingdom and have to do all of our shopping and eating at Downtown Disney, it is becoming ridiculous. I feel bad for independent restaurant owners, most probably won't last beyond the season.

"So many good recommendations here already. I’ll just add you’re making a great choice, you’ll have steady work from day one and make really good money — and it’s important both to the wellbeing of your neighbors and our whole society. And every day you’ll see the fruits of your labor. 

ReVision is a great suggestion if you want to do solar and electrification (EVs, heat pumps, etc). IBEW for sure is also a great option. SMCC has good programs, and the state DOL apprenticeship is also highly regarded. There are so many companies hiring electricians and willing to spend and support to get you trained.

"I didn’t run into any issues but received this today:

Hello Food Fighters -
Our first month-long event in Portland was in February 2020. The #BestDonutsPortland LoveFest. The world shutdown 2 weeks later. We started back up in September 2020 and to date have hosted a total of 8 events in Portland. We've been honing the month-long platform in Rhode Island for 10 years and have hosted a total of 104 events. All this to say, that for doing this for so long one might reasonably expect a more smoothly run #BestSandwichPortland Showdown this month. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

Please understand, any disruption any confusion, any inconveniences you’ve experienced are NOT the fault of the participating sandwich shops. The ownership of any and all issues that have occurred during this event fall squarely on Portland Food Fights. Sandwich shops agreed to partner with Portland Food Fights based on data we extrapolated using methodologies we’ve successfully utilized over the past 9 years. Owners signed up and agreed to participate in the competition to redeem 200 coupons. Our data has shown that restaurants could expect 40% of the total number of Passports sold would be redeemed at location. This ratio has held up over 9 years and based on this, we sold 550 passports.

Quite simply, for many of the shops we were wrong. Boy, were we wrong. Additionally, our lack of communication with the sandwich shops compounded the situation exponentially and for that I am deeply sorry.

As the founder I have heard the owner’s reasoning for not being able to keep up with all the redemptions: they are coming out of a pandemic, short staffed, with the highest food costs our industry has ever seen. This has resulted in them having to turn folks away. 

I am writing to ask you to please not post negatively about the sandwich shops on social media. Please don’t take it out on these hard working owners and staff. Please understand it is not their fault. It is ours and ultimately it is mine.

In business and in life, I have come to understand the difference between making an apology and making amends. As founder, I am actively working toward compensating the shop owners for the additional expense of coupon redemption over and above their anticipated level.

Toward that end, if you are among the coupon buyers who were adversely affected by this, please let me know by clicking this link and I will also make it right with you.",t2_3epl5a3,seaside-mama-207,0,1648740387.0,0,t1_i2uwg8y,i2uwg8y,True,TheOwlMan109,t3_toyqo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/toyqo9/on_a_roll_food_truck/,On A Roll Food Truck?,/r/portlandme/comments/toyqo9/on_a_roll_food_truck/i2uwg8y/,2,r/portlandme,0,2

‘Strong’ mayor model doesn’t guarantee racial justice
Some cities with strong, executive mayors have many of the problems Portland's Charter Commission is seeking to solve.

BY JOSHUA MOSS - SPECIAL TO THE PRESS HERALD

“Some progressive activists in Portland are claiming that a move away from our current council-manager form of government to an executive mayor form is an anti-racist cause.

Their argument is based on an analysis posed in a master’s-degree history paper from a former University of Maine student claiming the 1920s Ku Klux Klan influenced one of our dozens of charter formations, almost 100 years ago.

This analysis leaves out information from a historian interviewed by the Charter Commission, explaining that Portland was one of several hundred other cities switching its form of government in the early 1920s to combat corruption. This narrative also ignores the dozens of subsequent revisions to our city charter over the past 100 years approved by the citizens of Portland, including our current charter created entirely by Democrats in 2008.

Proponents of the executive mayor form of government have introduced no data to support the idea that the form of government produces better outcomes for people of color, and conveniently ignores the glaring racial inequality of our most unjust and corrupt city administrations in the country.

For certain, in recent years, the tragic, high-profile killings of Black Americans at the hands of police officers  in executive mayor-led cities such as Minneapolis, New York City, Baltimore, St. Louis and too many more have awakened Americans to our systemic problem of police brutality against people of color. But despite our country’s growing awakening to systemic racial injustice and police violence, executive mayors in these cities have not faced accountability for their failures to address these issues, nor produced better outcomes for their residents. Mayor Jacob Frey, Minneapolis’ incumbent when George Floyd was murdered by police in 2020, was recently reelected. He won handily over his two closest challengers, both running on more progressive platforms.

There are, however, significant downsides to an executive mayor form of government. According to City Lab and The Atlantic, the top 10 cities with the worst income inequality in America are all led by executive mayors.

Flint, Michigan, the predominantly Black city notorious for its poisoned public water supply, demonstrates how poor governance by reelected Mayor Dayne Walling can wreck lives. In Baltimore, Mayors Sheila Ann Dixon and Catherine Pugh were charged and sentenced for theft, tax evasion, fraud and conspiracy.

While opponents of a council-manager charter model fixate on the sins of the 1920s, these very real, very damaging scandals all took place within the last decade. Meanwhile, researchers at University of North Carolina’s School of Government found that municipalities with council-manager systems were 57 percent less likely to have corruption convictions than municipalities with mayor-council systems.

There is more we can – and must – do to protect our most vulnerable residents and communities, tackle income inequality, and make Portland a more welcoming city for people of all walks of life.

But given the evidence, progressives must ask: What racial justice gains or meaningful progressive reforms would we see in Portland under an executive mayor form of government that we couldn’t achieve with a council-manager model instead? And are we willing to accept the risks to our community to realize these goals?”",t2_h5fm3fw7,WildWest00,0,1648735494.0,0,t1_i2ukchw,i2ukchw,True,WildWest00,t3_tt0gd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/tt0gd7/httpswwwpressheraldcom20220329mainevoicesexecutive/,https://www.pressherald.com/2022/03/29/maine-voices-executive-mayor-model-doesnt-solve-racial-injustice/,/r/portlandme/comments/tt0gd7/httpswwwpressheraldcom20220329mainevoicesexecutive/i2ukchw/,11,r/portlandme,0,11

"I'm starting a new job in Portland in the middle of April, moving northward from Connecticut.

Should I be looking right now for a May 1 move-in, despite the fact that I'm in a different state and can't easily get up to Portland at this moment to tour apartments? Or if I start looking hard and setting tour appointments starting April 18, do you think I'd have a reasonable chance of finding an apartment within a couple weeks?

Our max budget is 1900 per month so I think we can afford the market (we're happy to live a little further out from downtown), it's just the matter of very few apartments going around for a lot of people.

"I’m not an expert on the intricacies, but the Faircloth Amendment basically locked every state’s public housing numbers at their levels as of 1997 (I think that’s the year it was signed). Lots of states have since sold off, demolished, or privatized public housing, meaning they are operating well below their Faircloth cap (I’m assuming Maine is too).

"I already posted in the Maine thread, will probably get downvoted to hell, so why not double-down here.  FTR, I’m an Independent. I’m not defending or disparaging anyone, I’m simply commenting:

The vehement hatred for SuCo is hard for me to understand. Maine has a long history of moderate Republican Senate representation. Would y’all have taken up pitchforks and torches asking for Olympia Snowe’s head on a stake? Would you have incessantly bashed Bill Cohen if Internet forums had existed in the 80’s?

She’s a Republican. She will more often vote with her party than with Democrats, but she will on occasion cross party lines. I just don’t think the vehement vitriol is helpful to the overall dialogue. She will never do right in the eyes of the angry left posters on this thread. Never. Regardless of her vote in any circumstance, people on that side of the aisle will bash her. In the same way most Dems must hate Manchin, I suppose, or Sinema. Angus King gets panned by anyone on the right as not being a true independent, he’s just a Dem in a neutral suit.

It’s just a sad testament to the polarized state of today’s politics, people refuse to believe that a genuine moderate can even exist. Or some people are so cynical as to their motives, those politicians will never get any credit for doing any good.  No wonder we have such extremists on both sides. People don’t even want for a middle to exist. And anyone who approaches it gets run right out, or bashed to bits on threads like this.",t2_d0e1lye0,ImpressionNo9470,1,1648646510.0,0,t1_i2pmseg,i2pmseg,True,weakenedstrain,t3_ts57vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/ts57vj/collins_to_back_jackson_for_supreme_court_giving/,"Collins to Back Jackson for Supreme Court, Giving Her a G.O.P.

"It won't be pleasant, but they'll make things so uncomfortable that they'll push the majority down there. With all of the subreddits over the winter discussing this and some comments from people a part of the homeless community I'm losing sympathy. One dude was talking about how much of a piece of shit he is and that he has no desire to ever change his life. That he doesn't like how his meds make him feel, can't hold down a job, and that he really enjoys his drugs. Then there was the guy who pissed in Blue Lobster a couple months ago....like wtf?!?!

Some of the people are great. There's a transient guy with a cat that dresses like a pirate. He'd tell jokes in character to make some money and was always respectful. He'll be able to take the bus in and still do his thing. There are some though 😬. I've traveled the majority of the country and the homeless population up here is almost unique.

Portland town council slowly but surely moved the seedy element of Portland out so that they could invite rich developers in. Dave Marshall pioneered this. He made money from this. He’s trying to do this in Lewiston. 

When you remove the elements of a city that make it good to visit, but not for too long, and just a touch scary, you remove the element the prevents the ultra wealthy from claiming stakes.  The result is a place overrun by outside money — stripping the city of the very things that made it great to visit.
