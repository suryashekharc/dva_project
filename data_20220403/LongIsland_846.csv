For over ten years I rented my house out at well below market rates for the same reason your dad is doing it.  I just wanted peaceful tenants that would pay every month and not begrudge me using the property for my boats.  I left a lot of money on the table over those years and the tenants never really seemed to appreciate that they were getting a great break till they were forced out for various reasons.

"Raise the tenants rate. Trust me, the tenant knows they are fleecing your dad.

If he does move, then your dad gets to charge 2500-3k a month.

I looked up at the prices and I noticed they were all 50 cents per gallon higher than what was on the big sign at the station, what gasbuddy told me and the prices at the other pumps which seemed odd to me.  So I went inside and told the cashier ""hey the pump right outside the door has the wrong prices"" and her response was ""that's the full service pump"" (as opposed to the rest being self service).

"No, the intent of yellow lights is to provide a warning to stop, because if you're moving you can't stop instantly, even at 5mph.

So the rule is yellow means stop if able to, but you'll never get a ticket. Red means stop, and if you're even just a little bit late you get a ticket because you had a warning that it will be red.

With cameras handing out tickets on buses this is very important, because if you're traveling at 5mph past the bus and the light turns red when you are on the side of the bus is the camera going to give you a ticket? After all you are passing a bus with red lights which is very clearly ticket worthy. 

And looking at this, I think NYS law does agree with you, the driving book says slow down and the law makes no mention of yellow. But if they're going to be sticking cameras on the bus then that just won't stand up in court. It is a defense that there was an inadequate yellow time to safely stop for a traffic light, and I don't see how that isn't also true with busses. If the rule is going to be you don't have to stop for the first X seconds a bus has the red lights on then I suppose that's fine, but it's very clearly not what the law says.",t2_3751k,edman007,0,1648941703.0,0,t1_i35x7cu,i35x7cu,False,clane2ndwindow,t3_ttxquh,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/ttxquh/suffolk_county_releases_6minute_video_of_drivers/,Suffolk County releases 6-minute video of drivers blowing past stopped school busses.,/r/longisland/comments/ttxquh/suffolk_county_releases_6minute_video_of_drivers/i35x7cu/,1,r/longisland,0,1

"The problem with relocating is you can’t make the same money in places that are cheaper to live. Mississippi is cheap, but what are you going to do there? Some parts of Upstate are cheap, but same problem. So it depends what you do, and what you’re willing to give up. Also, if you’ve not lived outside of NY, you’ll be in for a rude awakening when you find out your worker protections don’t always exist in other places. Think you’re entitled to a lunch break everywhere? Think again. 
So my best advice is do your research. We take a lot of things for granted here. A couple I know - he’s a cop and she’s a teacher. They make great money here. In Florida? Their salaries would be cut to a third of what they make here.

"> Now that said, they are in a position to actually get things done so we’ll see what they do with it. 

And when everything good they try to do gets blocked by republican obstruction, and worse, DINOs in the Senate (Manchin and Sinema), then you'll say ""see they didn't get anything done, so why vote for them"". 

>If they actually do good, I’ll give credit where it’s due and things are in the works for the better but there’s a lot of work to be done. 

So I'm going to guess you've never looked at the voting records for these parties. I can tell you that every time the Democrats are voting for things that are good for the country, and the Republicans vote against those things consistently.

>Moreover, the Trump rule is narrowly targeted and would not apply to most Americans.

>The rule would apply to federally qualified health centers, which are government-supported clinics that help people facing financial obstacles to care and prescription drugs. Specifically, it would require those centers to pass along to patients any discounts they get on purchases of insulin and epinephrine through a federal drug pricing program called 340B, rather than pocketing the difference.

His EO only applied to federally qualified health centers.

"So, is this for people who have insurance or for people who don't have insurance?

Most of my patients who are insured commericially, or on Medicaid/Medicare have minimal copays for their insulin already as long as it is a product on their insurance's formulary.

However, for uninsured patients, for example. Lantus Solostar, a box of 5 pens which has 1500 units of insulin total, costs me $410 to buy from the wholesaler. We sell it for $460, which has also never happened, because unless someone is a millionaire and uninsured, they are not paying $460.

The generic version of this costs me $142. For a cash paying customer, we charge $175.

Unless this bill does something about the original cost of the drug and tells the manufacturers and wholesalers that they can't sell it for more than $10 to the pharmacies and then the pharmacies can't sell it for more than $35, I don't see how the bill helps uninsured people.",t2_bkriu7j1,TetraCubane,0,1648829560.0,0,t1_i2zz9y2,i2zz9y2,True,UnlinealHand,t3_tto46w,https://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/tto46w/zeldin_and_garbarino_both_voted_against_capping/,Zeldin and Garbarino both voted against capping insulin costs at $35/mo,/r/longisland/comments/tto46w/zeldin_and_garbarino_both_voted_against_capping/i2zz9y2/,9,r/longisland,0,9

"Why did you lie ?

A regulatory pause is a common tradition among incoming presidents to ensure that the unfinished policies from the prior administration align with the new one. And that’s what happened, a pause, not a cancellation. Trump did the same thing going into his term and even left some Obama era policies in place once vetted. 

the Trump rule reflected a fundamental misunderstanding of federally qualified health centers and the 340B drug program, placing extensive administrative burdens on them.

The stated aim was to cut drug prices. However, it triggered alarm among safety net providers and bipartisan lawmakers because it would accomplish the opposite of what the Trump Administration intended — ultimately making it harder for health centers to provide affordable life-saving services and prescription drugs — especially during the pandemic.

Some patients who use insulin and EpiPens — the fraction who are served by federally qualified health centers — may benefit from Trump's order, but others could suffer if it results in decreased access for the centers to the 340B drug discount program. Also, the freeze which actually ended March 22 does not represent final action on the program, so it's premature to call it a ""reversal.""

Lol I love how your answer for why is - ""something along the lines of Trump is bad"". You did all the other research and then once you see that the Biden administration docked it, you immediately stop research there just so you can be reactionary. 

Turns out Trump made a sloppy EO for good publicity without much thought during COVID - shocking. You can read about it in section V. Rationale for Rescission and Section 1. Support for Rescission

"No place is perfect. I grew up outside of Albany. I have lived different places, including the midwest and spent some time in California. I love San Diego...

All seasons, close to Adirondacks, few hours from Montréal, Boston, NYC, good schools, moderate to low population density and traffic, Albany Airport short drive away, lots of land, and most of the suburbs in Saratoga County, with the small exception of the ones right in Saratoga proper, are pretty affordable. Most people cite the biggest downside as the notoriously dark, long, and Siberian-esque winters of the northeast as reasons not to live there but frankly I grew up with it, and major snow events aren't really that common, but nor are they unusual when they do happen.

"I went to the other insurance company once and they were very mean to me. I gotta say I dealt with a lot of crap in life but damn. They were just pain mean. The insurance will take statements. I think this is perfectly acceptable, whether they take the statement or the police report did. But, maybe the insurance will twist your words. Maybe the insurance will say there is a question on position of the cars. Maybe maybe maybe. I had originally called my insurance and we agreed it was fine to go straight to the other guys insurance becsuse it was a clear cur case. But after the games the insurance played, I eventually called my insurance in tears so they could take over. I had to pay my deductible and I didn't get around to filing my rental reimbursement. Eventually I got my deductible back because they settled it themselvesbut i never got my rental money back. 

I would never go to the other insurance by myself again. I was in graduate school, working full time and had vacation travel. My dad was sick. I actually had the accident when I was going to get him groceries.  The arguing and harassment took up weeks of my life. If I had just gone to my insurance it wouldn't have made such an impression on me and I would have got my rental covered.

"It might have been illegal years ago but it seems the law changed in August 2020.  They cannot be operated on sidewalks or streets with a posted speed limit above 30mph.  I can tell you that many cyclists ride the LIE service road and other roads that are over 30mph so I wouldn't worry so much.

 However, it is only as safe as you make it.  Flashing lights front and back are a must.  Having a rearview mirror at least on your left side is good practice so you can constantly monitor traffic behind you.  I have two, one on each side in the tube of my down bar (they fit into the bottom of the curved part of my handlebar).  Helmet obviously.
