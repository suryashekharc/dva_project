"I'm from Ontario, moved to Saskatchewan, and my partner and I will soon be moving back. 

We're moving back because we don't like it here. I got a job here that was perfect for me, but it's not enough. We simply can't imagine spending the rest of our lives here: the culture, the people, the driving-centric approach to city planning, the mediocrity of pretty much everything (sorry, but compared to the standards of quality in literally every area in the GTA, it's true!) 

That said, we are completely aware that our general standard of living is going to go down drastically. We have a nice house in a good neighbourhood with lots of space in Regina. We have money to spare. We're not going to have that in Ontario. Life, frankly, is going to be a struggle for a really long time. It's worth it for us because we'll be returning to a place we love with people we know and a culture we're bought into.

Is that worth it for you? The only real improvement in lifestyle you mention here is the weather. Yes, it's not quite as cold in Ontario as in Saskatchewan, but not by much. If the weather here is truly making you miserable, you are not going to be much less miserable in Ontario. And you mention buying a house as part of your plans. Do not plan on being able to buy a house in Ontario, at least not anywhere that's actually convenient of pleasant to live.  My partner and I are OK with the possibility of renting for the rest of our lives, or at least for a very long time. Don't move there unless you're also OK with that. Maybe you'll luck out and find something you want to buy for a price you can afford, but that's a terrible gamble to stake your happiness on. 

Obviously, only you can decide if it's going to be worth it, but if you can, I'd recommend at least visiting wherever you'd be planning on moving. Maybe staying in an airbnb in a residential neighborhood for a few weeks (in the winter, since winter weather is important to you), traveling around a bit (driving on the highways in rush hour, taking GO transit and the public transportation of whatever city you're considering) and deciding if you want to live there enough that you'll give up homeownership and your current financial comfort for it.",t2_fot4wr6k,anushkaanteportas,0,1648865964.0,0,t1_i329bae,i329bae,True,Known_Fruit_7508,t3_tt84mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/tt84mn/advise_moving_from_saskatchewan_to_ontario/,Advise - Moving from Saskatchewan to Ontario,/r/regina/comments/tt84mn/advise_moving_from_saskatchewan_to_ontario/i329bae/,0,r/regina,0,0

"Honestly not a Saskatchewan person (actually did live there briefly) but I did live in Manitoba for 15 or so years and grew up in southern Ontario. Now live in BC. My advice is fuck Ontario. The weather is better in some respects, but right now the housing market is just stupid. Unless you are able to live in somewhere like a small town where things are still affordable then forget it, not worth it. Toronto isn’t even that great of a city IMO. The only thing I ever missed the entire time when I moved from Ontario to Manitoba was Canada’s wonderland. That’s the only thing. Also I like prairie summers more than Ontario’s muggy hot humid summers. Winters in Ontario are better but still suck (and winters in BC suck too, you moved to a cold northern miserable country).

"I grew up in Saskatchewan, moved to Ontario, and because of COVID have moved back briefly to Saskatchewan. I LOVED living in Ontario. We lived in the south in St. Catharines and I loved it there. The weather was amazing, extremely hot in the summer though so that was hard on me and very, very humid, but the winters were so mild we could still enjoy the outdoors and go out every day if we wanted. Also, each season lasts 3 months, unlike in Saskatchewan where winter is like 7 months out of the year and the rest go by so fast. Again, humid. Super humid. Was not expecting how humid it was having lived in Saskatchewan my entire life. Some days it was basically 90 percent humid! Which made the 30+ degree summers even hotter, so definitely need AC. Though when I moved it was during winter, I went from -30 to being in the positives and while yes it's more humid there, I found it considerably warmer to live in Ontario during the winter. And again, it's much shorter. It didn't snow until like December! I was walking around in my fall jacket in the middle of winter and loved it so much. 

The biggest reason we aren't moving back is because of the cost of housing. If owning is something you want to do, then it will be hard to own a house in Ontario. The best hope is that one day the housing market collapses and the cost of housing goes down. You could also look at living outside of a major city, houses are cheaper, but not Saskatchewan cheap by any means. A 'cheap' house in Ontario even outside a major city is still like 300K, and that is usually a small house that would go for like 100K in Saskatchewan. You will also have a hard time finding a house with a decent yard too, so that's also another problem, but it does depend on where you move. 

You both would need to be working and getting decent wages to afford to own, at least in the market right now, and there are always bidding wars on the houses. Our friends had to apply to like seven houses before getting one, and had to wind up offering almost 100K over asking just to get the place they have now, and that's not even in a major city. It's outside of Ottawa by like 45 minutes. 

I loved living in Ontario, I really miss it, and if I didn't want to own so badly we would move back. Renting is frustrating to me, and we had rented from a few landlords while living there and only one was decent, the rest were awful. If you don't mind renting, and can find a decent landlord, then I say go for it! You could also look at getting a condo too, they are cheaper than houses \[generally\] but it's more like living in an apartment that you own. 

So it depends on what you really want in housing, and also whether the job is an improvement for you or perhaps has more room to grow. Government jobs often are good for stability, and you can usually get raises, so there is that too. It will be a shock though cost wise for living there. I found groceries much less expensive in Ontario, particularly because we live more North in Saskatchewan right now, but I found food costs more manageable. 

Renting wise, they have a WAY better tenant board so tenants have better rights there, and landlords can't just raise the cost of rent by ridiculous prices for whatever reason. Healthcare is also way better in Ontario. To get an ambulance where we live in Saskatchewan to the hospital \[which is just a couple of blocks away\] is $325, but because Ontario has OHIP, it cost us $45 to get to the hospital even across the city. They also give an extra $100 a month for child benefits, so that is great. I was not aware of that and had to take a hit from our child benefits when we moved from Ontario to Saskatchewan. 

Honestly, I could go on, and if you have more questions feel free to message me. I truly loved living in Ontario for so many reasons, I just can't get over how expensive houses are there and rent.",t2_52x6cylp,DancePants91,0,1648774270.0,0,t1_i2x9dit,i2x9dit,True,Known_Fruit_7508,t3_tt84mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/tt84mn/advise_moving_from_saskatchewan_to_ontario/,Advise - Moving from Saskatchewan to Ontario,/r/regina/comments/tt84mn/advise_moving_from_saskatchewan_to_ontario/i2x9dit/,1,r/regina,0,1

"1st Ave North has always been a ""fringe"" part.  It's not a great area but not the worst either.

I don't think that was recent or was some poser because 1923 and the W is for Saskatchewan Warriors.

They were a deal about 2-3 years ago when Native Syndicate all got locked up and fell apart.

At that point the three big ones in the city was Indian Mafia (Weirdly a small semi local gang from a reserve that became powerful in the city unlike the more national gangs like Native Syndicate, Indian Posse, and so forth), Native Syndicate Killers (Also go by 235 Posse or Killa Gang/Killa Posse), and Saskatchewan Warriors.

Saskatchewan Warriors were greatly reduced if not totally run out and Indian Mafia and Native Syndicate Killers (NSK) took over.  Indian Mafia was the more organized and recognized while NSK had much more numbers as more of a junkie gang.

Now with a lot of the players of Indian Mafia getting locked up in the last year and a half you now have Native Syndicate Killers as the big ones purely because of numbers.

Maybe Saskatchewan Warriors is having a come back but I doubt it as most of their heavy hitters got locked up previously in that 2-3 year back period.

Although the Warriors are a national gang like Native Syndicate and Indian Posse.

"We moved from Toronto to Regina in Oct. 

We were living in the east end called Greektown which technically is about 20-30 mins from downtown but it always took 45+ on a good day until I got an escooter and then it took me 17mins. 

We moved because my fiancé got a professor position at UofR and I’m currently unemployed which sucks cuz my type of work is limited here. Here is what I’ve learned throughout this whole time. 

GTA is extremely expensive! We had a one bedroom apartment that moved into 2015 and because back then rent was cheaper than now, we paid $1375 and our hydro was around $40-50 per month. Water and heat was included. Now in the same building the rent is 1,865 for a one bedroom. 

Cold is cold. I’m actually Greek and grew up in Greece so I freakin hate the cold. However, the humidity in Ontario is super brutal. There were lots of days/weeks this winter where Regina had better weather than Toronto. Yeah they might not get the -40s as much as SK does but they have extreme cold snaps too. 

Because we have not lived in Regina during the summer I can’t really compare yet but summer in Ontario is super humid. 

In terms of entertainment, damn I miss TO. I miss our friends and family and the options to do more stuff there regardless the weather. And we are still trying to figure out things to do here. 

Cost of living in Ontario really is quite a lot compared to SK. Basically you pay the air you breath there I feel. I don’t think we will ever be able to afford a home there. If we do it might be away from everything. The market in GTA is non existent. Ppl buy homes without inspections, sight unseen sometimes and a house can be on the market for like a day and then gone. It’s a brutal game there whereas here, we bought our first home. 5 beds 2 baths, has a basement suit that we rent out, in a great area in the south end and this house in GTA would EASILY be  1.3 mil. Not even joking. 

Commute is freaking brutal, never trust the GPS. Honestly add another 20mins on top of what is says. Which on the other hand here, you are literally wherever you need to be in 20mins or less. When you’ve had a bell of commute and transit or stuck in the car, you come to REALLY appreciate this commute in Regina. 

Saying all this though, if we got the opportunity to go back, I’d still probably go back but mostly cuz of family and friends. And if we were to go back it would be super hard adjusting to having a great house to back in an apartment cuz that’s likely what will happen or if we get lucky to buy a 2 bedroom condo somewhere and up sell it in a few years. 

Honestly don’t know what to tell ya. I might be biased cuz I came here kinda I don’t know… not unwillingly but not enthused let’s say. It’s alright so far but I’m hoping summer will make up for it. It will be nice to enjoy our backyard with our dog. 

Best of luck with whatever you choose to do though!

"That's a lot of extra expense. You'll likely never be able to afford a home in Ontario if only one person is working.  Even if you found a job that paid you $120,000 a year and you already have $200,000 ready for a down payment. It's that outrageous over there. 

It's definitely true that there is almost no tech jobs here. You might be able to rise up to a much higher paying job in Ontario if you're in tech. You'd have to have very desirable skills, and be willing to hop around to different employers often.

Depending on specifically where in Ontario, the winters might not be all that different. You can make them more manageable in Sask with luxuries such as a garage to park your car in.

"I'm assuming you're moving to a larger city in Ontario, hence the housing cost you mentioned.

I moved here 6 years ago from Ontario. Everything is cheaper here. My family and friends in Ottawa pay astronomical prices for homes once valued at 50-80% less.

The bonus side of living in a large city is that they have really good public transit.

The downside as you mentioned is this is only fine if you're willing to pay quite a bit of money for a home in a central area.

Some of my family members and friends have bought homes in outlying communities and still paid a more than average for their home, and commute. They often use park and rides for buses. 1-2 hr commutes in this case. 

Renting isn't easy, as a lot of places are expensive and already occupied. A lot of my friends that currently rent say they will likely not be able to buy a home within the city due to spending all their money on rent ( combined with the astrologically high home prices).

I just wanted to give you some points from people who currently live in Ontario. I personally would not go back. I hated the 'wet cold', and prefer a 20 min max drive thru the city! Though they don't have trains going over major  roads there typically....

Good luck with your decision.",t2_16r2n0,womaninradio,0,1648758196.0,0,t1_i2w6wun,i2w6wun,True,Known_Fruit_7508,t3_tt84mn,https://www.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/tt84mn/advise_moving_from_saskatchewan_to_ontario/,Advise - Moving from Saskatchewan to Ontario,/r/regina/comments/tt84mn/advise_moving_from_saskatchewan_to_ontario/i2w6wun/,13,r/regina,0,13

"OP it's the price you have to pay for good weather and a bigger city unfortunately.

I grew up in the GTA. Parents still live there but I can never imagine going back because I've been priced out of literally everything. Plus, I enjoy the short commutes and relaxed lifestyle in the Prairies.

My work life balance is good. Yes the weather makes me want to pull my hair out sometimes. But you have to set your priorities... Is weather really that important to you?

">But what I can't understand is how we have individuals renting whole homes and or having all the bills paid by social services when that can't even be done for working people. A lot of working people I know are struggling to get by with the basics these days.  


If you make too much money, your assistance will be clawed back, but unless you get a good job, you don't make enough to replace what you lost from social assistance. I know someone who worked at a daycare and said that parents would run into problems where they got assistance for childcare while going to school, but couldn't work too many hours or else their assistance would be cut, but the assistance wasn't enough to cover all expenses so they had to work. It's a shitty balance of trying to keep your work income low enough to avoid losing assistance but high enough to pay for things you need to live.

"School community programs, meal programs, food bank, other community programs all combined make it easy to maintain a low standard of living ( often below the poverty line).

The problem isn't those on social assistance or those middle(?) Class struggling to get by its the mass concentration of wealth at the top, politicians misappropriating money and taking kickbacks for giving bids to corporate friends.

A sprinkle of capitalism isn't bad, people should be rewarded for their effort and the contributions they make. But no one should have to struggle to maintain a basic standard of living while the top few exploit the rest, don't kid yourself , if you're upper middle class and down, you're being exploited. You're exploited at your place of employment, you're exploited when you go to the hospital, you're exploited filling up your gas tank, you're exploited buying groceries, if you're a paycheck or two away from being homeless you're being exploited. The system  is designed to funnel wealth upwards.

As a recovering addict who used many services in active and recovering addiction, the system can work but my needs were not as great as others. In my almost 7 years of being clean I've seen many people better and worse off than myself struggle and fall through the cracks. I've seen the best of people who needed just a little extra to survive and make it to another day succumb to addiction, mental health, poverty, a flawed judicial system, social services and child welfare.

I also work as a helping person with my bachelor of social work. The amount of people struggling who aren't even social assistance or commented to any community resources is insane.

We need to empower and strengthen our communities which means being empathic to each and everyone ( except for those rich fuckbags who make us struggle so they Can afford their private jets and golf courses).",t2_e7zcdp9f,face_butt_,0,1648752160.0,0,t1_i2vrcy9,i2vrcy9,True,WhichEdge,t3_tso1q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/regina/comments/tso1q9/welfare_something_i_dont_understand/,Welfare - Something I don't understand,/r/regina/comments/tso1q9/welfare_something_i_dont_understand/i2vrcy9/,7,r/regina,0,7

"I will say these people are outliers. We focus on them due to the controversy. Many people on social assistance don't admit it. I know many middle class adults who had to rely on welfare for awhile but would never admit it, told me in confidence ('perks' of studying psychology lol people unload on you). 

I do agree it's shitty but do we let them become desperate and resort to crime? It's a complex issue that I do not have the knowledge on how to solve but there are many factors.

Edit: I will admit as a kid I grew up in a VERY BAD house similar to what you described.. there's many innocent, good people that get on drugs for awhile then clean up. My parents did and are great people now but when I was a kid I fucking hated them. Live and learn, we are all human afterall.

"Regardless if a person uses drugs, has an intellectual disability, etc. they deserve basic human rights to be fulfilled. 

Trusteeship takes a long time to get someone on and it strips people of their autonomy. It’s not up to us to decide who deserves to get their money, etc. 

Any working person can apply for social assistance and access the food bank to alleviate expenses and undue hardship. 

The Sask government did have direct deposits and have used them some times recently for social assistance recipients to have rent given directly to the landlord. Unfortunately this hasn’t happened with many people so money is often a trigger to gamble, engage in drug use, etc. 

Rather than take away their rights and money, how about we look at pressing the government to fund more programs to help? Many of the people engaging in this behaviour are using it to cope with trauma.

"I can kinda speak on this as a former disabilities care worker and hospital security guard(although that was edmonton) 

It's a complex situation in regards to mentally ill people. The basic approach now a days is that they'd rather have the mentally ill out and about in society in the name of ""human rights"" until they commit a heinous crime that warrants them being put away for a long time. 

In essence the system is currently designed to put people in jail before we truely get them involuntary help. For example a psych ward or something. Which ive also worked around and a brain trauma unit. Jails have a crazy rate of like 40-70% being mentally ill from what i remember reading. 

Part of this approach stems from old traumas in the healthcare system. Mostly neglect as most familiar with cheap old folks homes know. Was real bad. 16 mentally ill patients in 1 shitty room type stuff and i think that was from moose jaws old institution. Basically due to the neglect they closed the facilities pretty much all across Canada and just released the ill back into the wild. Same thing happened in the states. 

I personally believe this was a politically motivated move to save money under the guise of respecting human rights instead of actually fixing the institutions needed to help these people. 

I can also attest to the system personally letting me down with my mother in this way. Suddenly having the most stereotypical schizophrenic thoughts of rcmp hacking her, loosing her job ect. Her disapearing for days combined woth suicidial ideation lead me to go get a mental health warrant at the court, which under the mental health act if youre a threat to yourself or others can be involuntarily detained for medical assesment. The Dr treated me like a liar when the whole family was sharing messages she sent and released her back to my house after 2 weeks without telling me. Tore my house up, police was involved and now shes on the streets somewhere being neglected and i cant help cause she'll bassically insult and attack me. 

And the thing is too these people cost taxpayers a shit tonn being out and about. About 80% of my security encounters were with mentally ill. Also worked City centre mall in edmonton. Police litterally telling us not to arrest certain petty criminals cause unless theyre going to jail its a waste of their time and money to hold the ill when they're already a ""million dollar man"" in regards to how much they owe in fines, hospital bills, ect. Hell some will call an ambulance cause they're bored or want a free sandwich. 

Again very complex situations and the fixes arent easy. Will take lots of lobbying and public education but with current societal trends I dont see it coming any time soon sadly as most are very self centered and dont care to educate themselves to help others.

"I'm pretty sure I know who you're talking about and it's not him. That guy has been around for years. I believe one of his nicknames is ""The King of Regina"". While he is incredibly annoying he is relatively harmless. I was told he has schizophrenia and a vet with PTSD, and when he's properly medicated, he's a decent guy. I called the police on him a few times and they just take him home I believe. Most people who work downtown know who he is and most are kinda protective of him.

The guy who was charged with the last incident at this shop, and many others, is actually pretty quiet usually. I served him a number of times while working downtown, and besides being a terrible tipper, he wasn't really a problem. Apparently we were one of the only places that hadn't banned him though due to his behavior, I just never saw it.

He's fairly easy to spot due to his, not sure how to word it, sense of fashion? I don't believe he is trans, but he is a large man who prefers booty shorts and fishnets, if you catch my drift. He typically is in need of a shower as well. In hindsight his hands were probably stained with spraypaint and not dirt.

I don't judge, and treated him the same as I would any other customer, so maybe that's why I didn't have any issues with him. When I saw him named in some other vandalism posts on FB I wasn't surprised though. His choice of fashion aside, the dude is definitely creepy af. 

If you want to look him up he is named in a few RPS media releases in regards to his vandalism charges, at least 10 in the last year.
