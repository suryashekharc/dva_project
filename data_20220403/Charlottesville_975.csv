Most of the wineries allow outside food, so I usually suggest bringing something. Grab sandwiches and sides from Food of All Nations or Ivy Provisions and enjoy!

"I’d rather be brief on a public forum. 
The brief story is:

He dismissed all my abnormal lab work and symptoms. Blamed it on depression. Balked when I expressed concerns.

Turns out I was suffering from malabsorption which went on so long that I developed other issues. With my system so broken down from not getting nutrients, I almost died 8 months after seeing him before I got some actual help. 

He was also inappropriate, rude, cruel, and fired me while I was in the emergency room going against state law. 

It was bloody awful. I’ve never had such an experience with any doctor.

">	is it not safe to assume that most bags of coffee someone could buy in town have not been roasted in the last few days?

Most of the local places I know of roast their coffee every week. That being said if you buy a 5lb bag at Grit, Mudhouse, or any other shop make sure to either ask what the roast date is or look for a date on the bag itself. 

The same thing applies to coffee from anywhere else you may buy coffee. If it doesn't have a roast date on the package I don't recommend buying it. 

If you also brew coffee with any pour over method you can see roughly how fresh or stale the coffee is each and every time you brew. Any brewing tutorial will tell you to let the coffee ""bloom"" at the beginning by wetting the grounds before doing the main pour. While you do this you'll notice bubbles coming up through the coffee. The more bubbles the fresher the coffee.",t2_2krg6uyx,Relyks_D,0,1648869681.0,0,t1_i32g7jr,i32g7jr,False,Zozothebozo,t3_ttwqit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/ttwqit/buying_good_coffee_in_bulk/,Buying good coffee in bulk,/r/Charlottesville/comments/ttwqit/buying_good_coffee_in_bulk/i32g7jr/,4,r/Charlottesville,0,4

"Not trying to tell you how to use your coffee, but unless you're using a ton of espresso you don't need 20lbs for home use. 

For example if you're dosing 25grams of espresso per dose you end up with around 400 shots of espresso. That's 13 shots per day for a month. 

Really I just don't want you to potentially waste the coffee. Coffee hits it's peak flavor a few days after its roasted and then loses that flavor over time. I've found that after about a month the coffee is pretty stale even when freshly ground.

Of course if this is for an event then don't listen to me. I know Mudhouse and Grit sell larger bags (5lbs I believe) of coffee.

"I do agree with what a lot of these people are saying. Dating in Charlottesville is often very hard because it’s a much smaller town than what it appears.

It’s possible to find wonderful people to date here, but I have heard many many complaints from a lot of my female friends.
Personally I live out in Crozet which is absolutely wonderful, a little cheaper than Charlottesville but it’s getting very popular.  But it is very close to the mountains and lots of hiking, and I can afford a house on an acre where I can work on my sculptures without bothering anyone.

"I'm a chick and moved to Cville from DC around your age. One of the many reasons had to do with all the outdoor activities. Eight years (and 3-4 relationships) later I'm in the process of moving to Richmond for a better social life. Part of my struggles started with Covid/remote work, as I didn't realize how much I relied on going into the office to stay plugged in to the goings-on in town. Cville isn't an awful scene, but when I told my DC and NYC friends that I ""got to the end of Tinder"" they didn't even know that was a thing...as in I swiped until there were no more options left. Its not a bad scene, its just not a big scene. The housing/rental market is crazy everywhere, so that shouldn't be a deterrent. All that being said, I don't regret my move as I was able to grow a lot in my career, was able to buy a house on my own (which I would have never been able to do in DC), and have made some incredible female friendships (half of who met their SOs on dating apps)...I just didn't have much success in the dating department.",t2_8h2cbzcr,HayGirlKK,0,1648678974.0,0,t1_i2rv4of,i2rv4of,True,m00nslut,t3_tsb9l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tsb9l7/thinking_about_moving_to_charlottesville_31/,"Thinking about moving to Charlottesville - 31, single, f",/r/Charlottesville/comments/tsb9l7/thinking_about_moving_to_charlottesville_31/i2rv4of/,9,r/Charlottesville,0,9

"34M here. Single and living in Charlottesville. Currently taking a break from dating though after getting out of a relationship.

As someone in your age group I think your feeling about the dating pool here and your success in dating is greatly determined by what kind of person you are and/or what kind of person in looking for. What is your ""type""?

IMO, the 25-35 and single people in Charlottesville fall into a few general categories. It is majority white people to start. Quite a few people in this pool are affiliated with UVA in some way whether it be graduate students, business school, medical students, hospital residents, or maybe work at UVA. Other non-UVA people tend to be what I would think of as former fraternity/sorority types in either a tech career or something to do with politics. As someone who is very outdoorsy, I don't think there are too many ""outdoorsy"" types. Mostly people who are happy to go on a hike and then visit a vineyard or brewery (which is a nice way to spend a day!). The rest are a range of other ""normal"" people.

Someone else please add your thoughts if you feel differently about the dating pool for this age group.

That being said, if you are used to a big city, it may feel like there are not a lot of options for dating. Despite some dating successes and failures over my time living here, I really like living in Charlottesville as a whole. If it doesn't work out for you, you can always leave right?",t2_1xstedh7,epurpur,0,1648664713.0,0,t1_i2qvlju,i2qvlju,True,m00nslut,t3_tsb9l7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tsb9l7/thinking_about_moving_to_charlottesville_31/,"Thinking about moving to Charlottesville - 31, single, f",/r/Charlottesville/comments/tsb9l7/thinking_about_moving_to_charlottesville_31/i2qvlju/,14,r/Charlottesville,0,14
"I dated in Cville in my 20s (I'm 32f now and in Baltimore) and I did find it challenging, as did my friends, but it's not impossible. It's not the most diverse dating pool and because the jobs/industry in Cville are limited, your dating pool might be limited as well. It really depends on your priorities and interests in a potential partner. 

I didn't love the dating scene because it was a lot of mid-twenties business guys (cuz of Darden) and while I'm sure many can be nice, we didn't share a tone of values. And I was also dating women and that scene was VERY small and it seemed like everyone had all already slept with each other so...that's something to consider if you're dating in pool that is smaller for any particular reason.

"They need to keep their powder dry on the real estate tax rate until next year - when they'll very likely need to go after the 7-8 cents they didn't get this year. Used cars will start depreciating again and residential real estate values will begin to level off with rising interest rates, so the massive revenue windfalls the city is due to receive from those items in 2022 almost certainly won't be replicated in 2023. Since personal property assessments are a black box to most people, it's a lot easier for politicians to sneak in what amounts to a stealth tax increase of up to 25% for a newish vehicle than to vote for raising the real estate tax rate by 10 cents after assessments rose by more than 11% on average.",t2_1uydq7ax,Wahoowa1999,0,1648502015.0,0,t1_i2hjb2n,i2hjb2n,False,adhonus,t3_tptdfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tptdfy/week_ahead_for_march_28_2022_budget_season/,"Week Ahead for March 28, 2022: Budget season continues as Charlottesville City Council to hold work session on capital improvement plan; Real estate tax rate increase could be as high as ten cents per $100 off assessed value",/r/Charlottesville/comments/tptdfy/week_ahead_for_march_28_2022_budget_season/i2hjb2n/,2,r/Charlottesville,0,2

"I had no idea that there was a mountain kim in Charlottesville but I went to a location in Northern Virginia. When I got older, I actually helped work there for the summer, and while it's a different location, I would assume the summer camp is the same. I think that it's overall very similar to other summer daycares. You do field trips that are not taekwondo related. During downtime, a lot of kids played video games or colored or board games (basically self-entertainment). For the TKD, there are daily lessons that are put into the schedule. The camp is only as good as the workers; I think that my location was pretty decent and you could tell that they loved making the kids have fun, but I have no idea what the instructors are like here so I can't help as much there. 

For the martial arts aspect, I would agree with what doh said that as long as you pump money into the business, you get the belt. But, I would say that you learn some aspects of TKD and you can get a lot out of it as long as your child is willing to learn it. There were a lot of kids that were into the martial arts aspect and were excellent with their form and power.

"As an American who dresses pretty formally (much more like they would in the UK), I concur, but compared to NYC, I find people in Charlottesville dress very nicely (nicely for me, since I like the preppy look) and though it might be casual, it is not as sloppy as in other US cities. 

Re: sense of humor. I have noticed that some people in Charlottesville do very well and understand my NY sarcasm, but others do not appreciate it, so I've found I have had to ""tone down"" a lot of my usual attitude since I was shocked when I first arrived and some people really got upset at certain comments I make...saying I'm ""too mean"" and things like that, so assuming OP has a ""typical"" Irish sense of humor, they might be a bit surprised at how some (I insist some, because some people def. get it) people may be taken aback and will interpret what you imply way more to get offended. 

Also re: walking. Charlottesville might be more walkable than, say, Lynchburg, but I found it extremely hard to live there without a reliable car or Uber service.

"Depends how long you're staying here, but everything here is pretty walkable for you as a PhD student from where you live. At least, in your immediate area you'll get to the University quickly, food, and other amenities. If you want to venture outside of town you'll need a vehicle as public transport isn't great as others have mentioned. The trains have a schedule but not very frequent - something I took for granted back home and miss, it'll seem archaic here. You may want to invest in a bicycle for the time you're here if that makes sense.

I've found it hard to get the food I like here but sometimes you'll find a few favorites in any of the local grocery stores but lately the supply chain isn't great due to the state of the world. Can always make things from scratch of course!

It'll be quite hot for you in the summer if you're here beyond May. I've been here for years but I still struggle with the heat and humidity. Be sure you get some light clothing for the warmer months, a good sun hat, sun lotion, etc. Most people dress quite casually too compared to places like the UK and Ireland, particularly when it comes to work at the University. Most men in the summer wear a polo shirt, or a short-sleeved dress shirt with khaki trousers in the summer for example.

Make sure you get some health insurance before you come over - perhaps that's covered by your PhD though? Also, have you thought about your banking situation?

Culturally you can struggle a bit with the sense of humor differences, and the attitude to work here is ""work = life"", it is changing though... slowly. There will also be some vocabulary and spelling differences to look out for. Race is also a big thing here, more than I experienced prior to moving to the U.S.

"Yep, we used to go up to Swannanoa when we were on the Blue Ridge Parkway.  There used to be a big statue of Jesus in the gardens - like 25 feet tall!  The last time I was there, we walked all around the old mansion, big chunks of the marble siding were laying on the ground and nobody was around.

I have heard that the property is owned by a fellow with the last name Dulaney - this makes sense, because it was purchased in 1944 by somebody with the same last name - Here's a link to to the history (I learned a lot by reading it!) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swannanoa\_(mansion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swannanoa_(mansion))  

I also have heard (completely unverified) that Mr. Dulaney owns the old inn that is off of the parkway and Rte. 250.  He recently (past 5-10 years) had some financial needs and borrowed money from a local developer/entrepreneur (Capshaw).  

It may take a while, but both properties will likely be renovated and/or developed.

"squat racks and free weights are a premium in this town but here's what i know

thegymcville: 60 a month, 24 hour access, like 8 racks, a monolift, free weights, specialty bars, a few machines, powerlifting/oly/strongman focused. im biased cause i go here

iron will cville: 60 a month 24 hour access, free weights, a ton of machines, body building focused gym. they have i think 3 racks and 2 combo racks (bench squat rack for powerlifting meets to standard). i've only ever heard good things about this place and the owner.

anytime fitness is like 44 bucks a month, its a globogym BUT i know a ton of locals who compete in powerlifting that can do it there so im assuming theres a fair amount of racks and weights.

theres a few boxes in town, i cant recommend those due to the lack of opengym hours relative to pricing. 

newtown fitness is a new one with a novel concept, they make you rent out the gym for yourself from what i can tell. its a cool idea if you dont like working out with other people. but they have at least one rack and some free weights per area, i think its pay per 30 minutes used, so im not sure if it will end up being cheaper.

Primal strength: $60 but its strongman focused, looks like its got hella bars and at least a squat rack, and equipment for strongman. never gone but have heard good things. Just not sure on the more conventional equipment you're looking for there.

">Basically, the main issue I'm having is that I do NOT want Windows 11. I also work online, so even though I want Linux, I don't know if it could be compatible with the software I use for work. 

I WFH and Windows 11 is why I moved most of my computers to Linux Mint.  After being unceremoniously blocked from connecting to my firm's VPN because I was still connecting from a Win 7 machine, and then seeing the requirements for Win 11 when the preview was first announced, I decided it was time to revisit Linux for the first time in more than a decade.  After setting up my first Linux machine in July of last year, I have no regrets.

I can appreciate your desire to have someone set it up for you, but if you're serious about moving to Linux, you'd better get used to getting your hands dirty, including being able to install the OS itself.  Linux is far more user-friendly than it was compared to the last time I used it, but even after it's setup, it's not quite as easy to use/maintain as a Windows system.

>Proponents claim kombucha tea helps prevent and manage serious health conditions, from blood pressure to cancer. These claims are not backed by science. Limited evidence suggests kombucha tea may offer benefits similar to probiotic supplements, including promoting a healthy immune system and preventing constipation. At present, however, valid medical studies of kombucha tea’s role in human health are very limited — and there are risks to consider.

"I foster for CASPCA and when I've gone in to pick things up or for potential adoptee appointments they staff is usually running around trying to do everything.

If you're in the area it might be worth stopping in and asking. They are busy, but all the staff I've ever interacted with have been super helpful.

I don't know much about the Cville city schools, but I used to volunteer in the library of one of the county elementary schools. I don't remember the specific process, it involved an orientation to go over rules, getting a background check done, etc., but at least before covid there were tons of needs. I'd also give Big brother/ Big Sisters a call. They run programs out of several schools and may need assistance. It doesn't have anything to do with animals or kids, but I also just remembered that Loaves and Fishes may need volunteers.

Their 25# bag of the same stuff is $92, so under $4/lb. I just don't need 25lbs. Their price per lb last year was much closer between the 3lb and 25lb bags.

"On personal experience I do not trust UVa northridge. I went back to my doctor in dc to manage my medication because the first thing Anita Clayton had her resident do was take me off Prozac and go on Wellbutrin.  This put me in a rapid cycle state and made me very irritable, almost complete rage. So the next resident under her direction increased the Wellbutrin.  This made the depression and irritation even worse. So they added another medication of the same type and that drove me into a deeper depression. While in this state they just asked how my dating life was going. I had lost my job, had huge fall out with my family and could barely function.  I had to go back to annual appointments and monthly phone calls with the doctor I saw before leaving for he dc area. He was shocked what had happened.  I later found out from dr. Shemo that he used to run that clinic and trained Anita Clayton. All she does is run paid “studies” by the pharmaceutical companies and writes books on antidepressants and sexual health.

I have been there a few times and the last time I went directly from 5 East to Region Ten and that was the perfect solution. 5 East will make sure you are safe and handle the immediate crisis, and Region Ten will help get you set up for the future. I will say that 5 East is very much what you make of it. If you go there not ready to get help, it'll be miserable, lame, and useless. Everything will seem stupid. If you really want to get better you'll have to do some of the silly activities in the art room and such, but you will get some good out of those activities. 

Basically, whether a person is ready to get better or not, 5 East will keep them safe and try to stabilize there; whereas, if a person is ready to get better and start putting forth their own effort it can be incredibly helpful! 

Going from 5 East to Region 10 worked so well for me because I could crash and slowly rebuild. I spent the first couple days at 5 East completely quiet and processing; the next few talking to nurses, doing the activities, planning, and processing. After that I went to Region 10 where there is freedom to cook and it's a more open area. Once I was there, the crisis had passed enough that I could deeply take advantage of their great resources and build myself up to a state that I was ready to leave. 

The two are very different. If you're in crisis, go to Region 10. If you need intense support, go to Region 10. If it's both, go to 5 East and then Region 10.",t2_g88cf,adorkablepenguin,0,1648256745.0,0,t1_i2518km,i2518km,False,[deleted],t3_tny627,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charlottesville/comments/tny627/best_local_for_hospital_mental_health_crisis/,Best local for hospital mental health crisis?,/r/Charlottesville/comments/tny627/best_local_for_hospital_mental_health_crisis/i2518km/,13,r/Charlottesville,0,13

"Although it wasn't an emergency or admittance situation, I've had positive experiences with the staff at UVA's Northridge facility. A friend had good things to say about her emergency stay with Region Ten.   


I think everyone who even considers going in for help, is probably scared and anxious. It's not something we talk about generally, so it remains mysterious. I'm sure word would get around, though, if a particular facility had a lot of horror stories. I'm sure your doctor or therapist would tell you if they had bad feelings about one. If you have family or friends that might visit, I would choose the one closest to them, just to encourage more visits.   


Most importantly, just get yourself help from somewhere. It's a very brave thing to do, to overcome your worries and fears in order to make your life better. You are stronger than you realize.
