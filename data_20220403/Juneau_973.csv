"Thank you for pointing out the issues with Pederson. Rorie dismissed the idea of letting it go to developers to put in infrastructure, thinking he would make more money for the city on it. Being adjacent to wetlands bit him pretty hard. Pederson hill was a huge battle getting it through the Lands Committee, the Planning Commission and then the Assembly.

"Yep. My partner and I are lucky that we have pretty affordable housing for about the next year or so, but we’re probably going to be leaving Alaska after that. 

Everyone is quick to point out that housing costs are rising everywhere, but forget to take into consideration that everything else costs so much more here too. Food, utilities, transportation, etc. is at a premium. 

We actually spent a few months last summer in Colorado (my partner grew up there) and even though our rent was only slightly less, we ended up paying a significant amount less in overall bills just due to everything being cheaper. 

People also forget that many of the cities they compare Juneau housing to have much higher minimum wage. Minimum wage in Juneau rests at around 10$, whereas Denver’s is 15. That’s almost 30% higher than here.",t2_jprtx2ff,ArtDefiant3304,0,1648951853.0,0,t1_i36abhi,i36abhi,True,Medium_Cricket,t3_tuddfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Juneau/comments/tuddfn/juneau_housing_is_awful/,Juneau housing is awful,/r/Juneau/comments/tuddfn/juneau_housing_is_awful/i36abhi/,2,r/Juneau,0,2

"Again, whenever the City uses public funds to go towards building housing, developers challenge them by arguing that they shouldn't be competing with the free market, and they do have a somewhat valid argument. There are things that the City can do and has done. They've recently established a program to provide grants for people to add accessory apartments, they've provided development and tax incentives for developers to provide below market rate housing like the VOA development in West Juneau and the apartment development off Cordova Ave that added something like 100 units, they've disposed of public lands for residential development like the Lena area and Pederson Hill, they've revised zoning policies relating to things like density incentives and cottage development, they've made it easier for developers to subdivided lots without having to develop street standard access. We live in a culture in Alaska where people don't like being told what to do with their property and that makes it tough for trying to get people to build more housing. Some of the last remaining large developable lots in Juneau are owned by a few people who have no interest in building housing.

My partner and I bought our house in 2020 and I'm so glad we did. The cost of buying or renting is so unaffordable right now. We rent out a room to a seasonal worker every summer at a reasonable price. Renting out rooms for $1000 a month is utterly ridiculous. Almost all of my friends who have apartments attached to their homes have changed from long term rentals to AirBnbs. I have no idea where all the seasonal workers are going to stay this summer.

"Well, it's hard to get a good sense for Juneau in a day, particularly in March.  
Assuming that you have a rental car, I would do something like the following.  Start the day with pastries at the Breeze-In in Lemon Creek.  It's a SE Alaska institution.  Drive out to the Glacier Visitor Center, put eyes on the glacier, and hike the Trail of Time and/or the East Glacier Loop.  EGL may still be fairly icy/snowy, though, so bring spikes or only plan to hike parts.  Hit up Forbidden Peaks afterwards for beers + lunch.  They have great outdoor seating w/ heat lamps and, IMO, is fairly kid friendly.  I'd follow that up with checking out the downtown, walking the boardwalks, and doing a DT-Basin Road-Flume trail walking loop, assuming the urban avalanche forecast is low and the weather is decent.  Consider taking your kid to the state museum; they have some very cool Alaska Native artifacts and exhibits (check to make sure it's open on Saturdays, I'm not sure that it is).  As an alternative, you could also take your kid to check out the fishing boat fleet at the DT harbor -- that might be a neat kid activity.  The downtown breweries are solid too.  Eat dinner at the Island Pub on Douglas - it's the best pizza in town.  
Alternatively, since it's tough to see all of Juneau in a day, you could ski a half day at Eaglecrest -- which is a gem -- and then do some of the above.",t2_gaibhtgp,the_ivory_bill_lives,0,1648529767.0,0,t1_i2j1l12,i2j1l12,True,Ressika,t3_tqpxgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Juneau/comments/tqpxgt/visiting_juneau_this_weekend_what_is_must_seemust/,Visiting Juneau This Weekend - What is Must See/Must Do?,/r/Juneau/comments/tqpxgt/visiting_juneau_this_weekend_what_is_must_seemust/i2j1l12/,9,r/Juneau,0,9

"There are lots of long hikes, you can connect lots of ridges along the Juneau road system. Basically anything from West Peak to Thunder Mountain can be connected in various ways without coming back to sea level.

There are no long mountain bikes, the longest trail (which involves a fair bit of hiking) goes from Eaglecrest down to Sandy Beach on Douglas Island. You can road bike but we only have like 60 miles of road. 

There are lots of long skins, but by May you'll have to hike a ways to start skinning. A common weekend trip is to hike Blackerby Ridge to Camp 17 and tour around in the big glacial bowls. It's a good hike in to 17 with heavy packs, I think its like 7 miles or so but can be done after work on a Friday in summer.

"There is a shuttle bus to the glacier from the docks. You can buy a ticket ($45) from the Blue Bus Glacier Express kiosk at the dock. There is a city bus (much cheaper), but it doesn’t go all the way to the glacier and you will have to walk a mile to get to the visitor’s center (it’s flat and there is a nice walking/biking path that runs parallel to the road). 

At the glacier I suggest going to the visitor’s center first. They have a nice display with info about the glacier and the wildlife around here. And you can get a trail map. The best hikes are to Photo Point (about a half mile round trip) and Nugget Falls (2 miles round trip). Both are easy, flat walking and paved. Photo Point is also on the way to Nugget Falls. From the visitor’s center you can also walk down to the lake shore and explore that area. If you want a nice hike in the woods then I suggest Trail of Time.

"Moving to Gustavus (Juneau is one of the stops) myself. The ferry would probably be the easiest but it's pretty pricey right now from Bellingham, over $2k for my little car full of stuff. Since I'm hoping to drive through Canada to Skagway for the ferry (under $400 to ferry from there), worst case scenario for me, I get denied entry into Canada and have to drive to Bellingham anyway. In the end the way gas prices have shot up I'll probably be spending the same amount to drive.

Mail your smaller things. If you have lots of books or things USPS considers media, ship that stuff by media mail, by far the cheapest. Other small but heavy things stuff into flat rate boxes and buy labels from a third party like pirateship, about a dollar cheaper per box than paying at the post office.

If there's a lot of stuff you want to buy for your new place, dont get it before your move unless you can only get it in CA.

Breeze In is an amazing convenience store and they make delicious fresh pastries daily.

"A new game shop just opened up called Riddle Valley games, i believe its focused on tabletop/trading card games, but we don't have a proper video game store anymore.

Theres two pawn shops in town where you can occasionally find some gems tho. Checkmate Pawn is open monday-saturday during the day and then Juneau Pawn is only on the weekends.

If youre staying on campus, there's a little shopping district just down the road that you'll get well acquainted with. Squirez is a dive/sports bar with a restaurant inside that historically changes out every few years. Right now its called The Anchor, pretty standard Alaskan fare: https://www.facebook.com/TheAnchor907/

Beneath the bar is a Chan's Thai kitchen. Bit of a legendary spot, too. Regularly has lines out the door. I think there's a clothing boutique next to that and the Auke Bay Cafe is in the same building. I haven't been in but it seems to be pretty standard breakfast fare. 

Theres also a brewery nextdoor called Forbidden Peak and they have a restaurant in there called the Red Spruce. Its like high end gourmet street food, very solid all around.

If you are a bar person most of the bars are downtown.  I can't really say more about what is good or not as I don't drink.

You will probably want a car.

Breeze In in the Valley is expensive but open 24/7/365.  Also has the best doughnuts in Southeast Alaska.

There is no Taco Bell.  The place in Nugget Mall, (La Salsa?) is your best bet for Mexican Food.  If you get Downtown, El Sombrero is the other good option in Juneau.

King Salmon start in late April or early May.  More salmon start running late July and the season is mostly done in late September.

Mosquitos and gnats are bad from late May to October.  Find DEET.

Summer Sun in Juneau is around 18 hours.   Get black out curtains or tinfoil for your windows.

Juneau has tons of weird little groups with activities for all sorts of stuff.  The problem is that they are tiny groups and a pain in the ass to find.  Between bad weather and expensive indoor spaces there aren't a lot of clubs and open groups to be had.

"Walking on Douglas (and a lot of Juneau, actually) is, unfortunately, terrible advice during winter and much of late fall and early spring. 

No sidewalks, VERY few streetlights, no shoulder in the winter due to snow berms, and typically poor visibility in rainy/snowy/sleeting/foggy weather. Basically a recipe to get hit by traffic

Not nearly as much of a problem in late spring or summer when the shoulders are clear and the days are longer, provided being perennially wet is ok. Same goes for bikes,

Bus service is an issue in Thane, out the road past Auke Bay, and infrequent on Douglas. Valley and downtown are workable via bus.

Don’t bring a really nice or irreplaceable car to drive over winter, lots of road chemicals. ACTUAL SNOW TIRES are a must, and AWD a bonus.

Federal flats area is a good spot (downtown) if you can find housing, as many outfitters are located out towards Thane or in the downtown area. Can’t say about all but most. 

Mendenhall valley is very far away, as well as many places out Auke bay/eagle beach area. Where are you required to be for work?

I’ll tell ya. Legislature is in right now and all those people have the $$$ to just throw down on housing. It’s a really tough market right now. But don’t be discouraged.

I actually did some digging after I made that comment and the city says they expect 1300-1500 racers. So maybe around 2k people total? This will definifely be a big event, but in one of the more sparse areas of town (Auke Bay) I'm sure the accommodations will be especially tough! Tbh, a bigger concern may be local transportation once you're here, as I'm sure rental cars are also all booked up by now. If I were you I'd check that out too, soon.

In any case, it seems like the city and other local orgs have been in direct contact with Ironman, so I'm sure it'll work itself out.

"Here's some additional information: 

The hotels are many B&Bs are booked; however, rooms may become available a little closer to the event as the properties' reservations shake out. We would like locals to consider opening their homes to athletes and support staff and I'm working now to get a sense from IM AK how many athletes still need housing. Reminder that many Juneauites that usually rent their homes are not thinking about that yet - more housing will come online late winter/early spring. 

Day of race is Aug 7. Registration was capped at 1200, and there's always some attrition. Each athlete brings 2-4 folks with them, so total event visitation could be around 3200. 

IM AK staff will be staying at UAS; there is no additional housing at the university. 

Travel Juneau has a microsite set up ([https://www.traveljuneau.com/ironman](https://www.traveljuneau.com/ironman)) and there's a tab for locals. This site will have additional local and athlete content added in the coming weeks as race officials begin solidifying the plans. 

The IM AK Facebook page has a master #accommodations thread. Those who would like to list their properties for rent should do so there, after registering the property with CBJ. Instructions for that are on the microsite.

"Apologies for the delayed reply. Death in the family.

I'm glad to hear you've got experience coming up here. My experience with job hunting: I left resumes with the LIO, the House/Senate clerks, and Legislative Affairs. I ended up getting a couple bites. I think a nonpartisan staff position would be superior to working for an actual leg.  If you were to get a job quickly, you might end up in a situation where you can get proper lodging. I don't anticipate any caucus reshuffles or early-session disorganization, but if that were to happen for whatever reason, hiring would likely freeze.

Are you on the road right now? If you haven't passed through Washington yet, you're a bit SOL because nearly all the highways in and out of the state are either snowed in or flooded.

"Hello fellow adventurer. I also was on a campaign in Anchorage and drove back to the Lower 48 in late November. I took the Cassiar Highway because that’s what pops up when you put it in your Apple Maps. I AM BEGGING YOU (as the Canadian Border Patrol warned me several times) NOT TO TAKE THE CASSIAR HIGHWHAY. The first Hurdle is obviously the Weather. You will experience routine white out conditions. Since it’s January a lot of those will be in the dark. The next is the roads themselves. The Cassiar highway literally goes up and down mountains. You’ll need to chain up your rig to stand any chance and that will lower your mileage significantly which brings me to my third point which I think is the biggest reason is that the Gas pump in Dease Lake to the nearest gas pump at the end of 37 is like 450 miles apart. I think from Junction 37 to Dease has another stretch of like 250 miles. If your map tells you there are more they looked like they were closed for good when I went. If your chain up your Camry it will not make it. Weather conditions and terrain be damned you can’t make it in a normal vehicle if you chain. I didn’t chain and almost went off the sides of maintains, into snow banks, and stalled out dozens of times and flattened by a big rig once and made it with 20 miles in my tank. There are no places to pull over for the night, no offshoots, no kind strangers, no remote cabins. Hell the only people you’ll see on that 400+ miles is logging trucks maybe once every 30 minutes.

What's the thinking on ALCAN vs. Cassiar Hwy?

"I appreciate your concern, but I'm not exactly shoving off on a prayer here. I think I'm over most of these hurdles already, and have backup plans if things don't work out. Let me know if the thinking I outline below strikes you as nuts, but I think the 'where to sleep' thing is about the last big one I haven't figured out yet.

This is not my first time driving to Alaska--I worked for a few months last year on a campaign from Anchorage and drove down in mid December in some less than ideal conditions, camping a couple nights down to -15ish. That shit is unadvisable and I don't plan on doing it again, but that's kinda my threshold for 'okay, I wont die.' I'm taking the Casiar highway up to Haines and taking the ferry down. The price difference from the Bellingham ferry is $2215 vs. $206 and much as I'd love to do it, that's just too much to justify. I've been keeping a close eye on the weather and I think we'll be okay--there's a big cold snap moving through BC and YT this week, but if the forecast holds I'll be driving up on the back side of it, mostly in light (1-4in/day) snow. I've planned for only 7 hours of driving each day, so plenty of flexibility over 6 days of driving if weather sucks. Above 0 the whole way if I'm lucky and the forecast holds. I'll spend money to stay at roadhouses if I'm not. Dog is big and fluffy, built for the conditions. 

Likewise with Covid and the capitol--pounding the pavement on this over the last couple months, I end up on the phone chatting up staffers most weeks and the picture I get is basically as follows: they're back to a full staff load, and while some professional staff will stay remote, the kind of front-desk, entry level stuff I'm in for is all going to be in person. I've been deep into a couple interview processes for these gigs but had both cookies crumble the other way. That's been hard, but the offices that rejected me are on team 'get MadCow a job/place to shower' and have been remarkably, unexpectedly helpful as we come right up to it here. As I'm sure you know, many offices don't fill these gigs until right at the last minute--of the 11 openings I identified in early December, at least 5 are still open and I have a bunch of phone calls to make today to check on a bunch of maybes. I understand the Legislative Information Office does great work to find staffers housing, and these gigs pay enough to make paying to live in Juneau feasible. 

If it all goes to shit I'm planning to head up to anchorage by 2/1 or so, hopefully less than $1500 or so lighter for having done so. I've got folks we can stay with there and have good leads on other, longer term, employment in the anchorage area, so it's just up to a couple weeks in January in Juneau here that I'm worried about.

"What's your driving strategy? You'll need to take a ferry either way because there's no road in or out of Juneau. Have you already booked passage on the ferry from Bellingham? I would highly advise against driving up through Canada to Skagway this time of year.

As someone who has done the ""let's see if I can get a job in the legislature"" thing, keep in mind that frugal living is not really a possibility. It's expensive to live here, period. And the sorts of accommodations you're looking for are not likely to be available.

The other factor here is that Covid has reduced activity in and around the Capitol in the past few years, which means fewer personnel necessary, which means fewer positions available and, in many cases, a hybrid live/remote work routine. That'll require accommodations with good internet, at the very least, so you can't really manage that kind of work while slumming it.

I think it's a fun idea to shove off for Alaska with a bit of hope, but I'm afraid timing and circumstances make this not the right year to try this sort of endeavor. I'm afraid it's guaranteed to end in disappointment and a bad experience not just for you, but your dog as well.

"Hello everyone, happy new year.  We've had a number of messages and inquiries over the last couple of months, I received another one this morning so I figured I would post an update for anyone that cares to read it.   I have a drop box link below for some of the images that we have taken during the dirt work stage.  There is one image taken in early December that shows the high tide and seawall we had to build.  You kind of have to zoom in to see it.  It's the only image in the snow.

Permitting: 

For the most part it's been fairly steady progress.  Permitting through CBJ Juneau has been easy and hassle free. I'm still kind of blown away by how helpful the city people are.  Here in San Diego, the people at the county act like they are doing you a favor by doing their job, the people in Juneau are the polar opposite, they are happy to help, answer questions and actually do their jobs well.  It's really refreshing to see there are still places where government workers are helpful and competent.  

Site Work:

This is the first stage where we kind of hit a snag.  We wanted to have the lot a little further back behind the tree-line but when we drilled our test holes for the foundation we found something that is called glacial retreat.  It's basically a soil composition that is a few grades above peat moss.  Its fine to walk on, outstanding for gardening, not so good for a house foundation.  This resulted in us moving the lot forward some a little closer to beach where there is hard rock/sand bottom.  The solutions was to barge out 500 cubic yards of large gravel and build a sea wall to elevate the pad (see image).  This was an unplanned expense (about $45K) but not a killer.  I also want to state for anyone considering buying on the island I do not believe this is an endemic issue to the island.   Our two neighbors did not have to deal with this.  We chose our lot because of the view and the elevation, the other lots that are not as elevated will \*NOT\* have this problem.  We also had a little stream on the northwest corner of our lot that probably contributed to  this.  Whatever the cause, the solution was a straight forward easy one. Most lots in Juneau on the mainland have a Butt-Ton of gravel laid down for the pad, the only reason ours was a little more expensive was it due to coming out on a barge.  

Building:

If all continues as planned we will start building in March.  This winter and last winter were heavy ones, I think Juneau set a snowfall record last year, and might do it again this year.  From what I'm told that's just life in SE Alaska.  Some winters are mild, some are heavy, it just is what it is.  What this does mean for us though is kind of a fungible start date.  If winter hangs on late we might not get started until April, if it melts away sooner then we could start in March, it really depends on weather.

Moving:

I will post more on this if anyone cares, but the moving process is going to be a little move involved than loading / unloading a truck.   The most complicated part is the last 2 miles from Auke Bay to the island.  Eagle Raven Logistics looks to be the solution.  They have the landing craft that can handle this. Again due to being on an island it will elevate the cost of the move by about $1000, but the moving process is not the 900lb gorilla I thought it was going to be.  Cargo and materials go to outer islands all the time in SE Alaska, ours will not be anything new, different, or unique.  it's just another load on a landing craft. 

The link for the pad images are below, again I'm putting this up because a few people have asked.  If you have an interest in the island feel free to hit me up, I'll be happy to share what we have learned up to this point.

It only lasted for two and a half days I quarantined for 14 days while I smoked a carton of cigarettes. I drink smoke too much hence why I was worried about walking into the forest. I have a very personal friend who was very sick who had her two shots.

"taking the bus in general sucks unless you have a lot of time on your hands, compared to a lot of larger cities the coverage is sparse and very intermittent. 

As far as rental cars go, see if you can get something with winter tires because it has been quite treacherous on the roads lately, some of the highways have been a literal sheet of ice the last few days.

If you’re going to walk around in the winter time, at least get yourself some good reflective gear. Local tradition seems to be wearing dark clothing for any road without a sidewalk, which means pretty much all of them in the winter because they don’t clear the snow off them very often.

"Absolutely. Thanks for reaching out. Downtown is a small concentrated area of boutiques, local shops and tourist shops. Downtown also houses the bulk of state office buildings as well as the bars. The streets are very steep and narrow. (Think of a tiny San Fransisco). Parking in downtown can also be difficult if renting it may require street parking and walking to your home
as the rentals downtown may not have assigned parking spaces or may have limited parking space. Housing can be nice downtown (this was not our experience when we first arrived). Downtown is old and this means some of the building and the rentals aren’t comparable to what you’d find in anchorage. That being said there can be nice rentals downtown. Douglas is an island that you access from a bridge across from downtown. There is South Douglas which has a great pizza joint, cafe, bar, sandy beach at the very end which connects to the Tredwell mine trail which is a historic trail that still has ruins from when it was a bustling mining town larger in population than Juneau. It has a library and fire station, Perseverance Theatre (this is where local Stage productions take place) and then housing. North Douglas is all housing, Eagle Crest Ski Area, and trails. If looking to buy or rent Douglas South or North is most likely to give you the most square footage for a more affordable rate. Of note there is no grocery store on Douglas. You would need to drive across the bridge and go to the downtown grocery store or drive most of the way to the valley to go to Fred’s or in the middle is Costco. The middle area between downtown and the valley is
known as Lemon Creek. The correctional facility, Home Depot, Costco, Alaska Brewing Company Headquarters, half way house, and a great place to get burritos Breeze Inn, some housing  and other industrial businesses exist in this area. The valley has the higher concentration of housing, schools, grocery store and honestly feels a bit like Eagle River on a smaller scale. Most individuals with families choose the valley due to the ease of access to grocery stores, the ease of parking, the access to the trails, parks and other recreational areas as well as the more traditional neighborhood layouts. Then there is the Auke Bay area (also, known as out the road). This area contains the University, trails, fishing, hiking, camping, disc golfing, and some houses. 
 The biggest differences in these areas has more to do with what your interest and hobbies are. If you like to go out on the weekends, downtown is going to offer more of this scene. Downtown is where artist showings happen 1st Friday of the month, you can go from
Bar to bar with ease, catch live music playing in bars, has the nicer restaurants. If you want to be able to go out on the weekends and walk home, downtown is the place to be. If you want a place that is close to that but let’s you get away from it if you want to, the. Douglas is a nice alternative as the cab fare won’t be much. If you want to be able to go out but not all the time and want to spend more time recreating outside or in your own home then the valley and Auke Bay will give
That distance with the cab fare running you about $20 on a Friday or Saturday to get back to the Valley. Of note if political ideologies matter the Valley does tend to be more conservative, but as a whole I would not say this to be true of Juneau as a community. 
The difference between Anchorage and Juneau as a whole is that Juneau pays taxes. Therefore Juneau has very well maintained trails, parks and roads. The people in Juneau care about their city and each other. Juneau is an expensive place to live but the community out pour when crisis or tragedy does strikes is tremendous. We are isolated here and as such we recognize that to some degree we need one another. I’d also say a big difference is just how friendly people can be here in Juneau compared to Anchorage. Other big difference is as a working adult; Juneau let you feel as though you are retired. You are so close by to everything that you get a bit of an island vibe. You are so limited in your choices that you rarely feel that stress that comes with the hustle and bustle of a big city. An example of this is let’s say you work downtown and live in the Valley. That’s 9 miles between. In Anchorage that can take you 30-40 minutes to get across town. Here it’s almost always a 15 min commute. That leaves a lot of extra time to enjoy your hobbies. 
As for the local shops just depends on what you are shopping for. We have great clothing boutiques, artist shops, fudge shops, Alaska Brewing Company, Devil’s Brew, there is also a distillery downtown, western auto is a great local shop for fishing, camping, hunting, gardening needs, really just a great general purpose store, Jerry’s meat, already mentioned Breeze Inn. Bottom line is there just aren’t big box stores here the ones we do have are Costco, Fred Myer’s, Safeway, Petco, Office Max, Joann’s, and Sportsman Warehouse.

"I relocated with my husband from Anchorage to Juneau 12 years ago and have never looked back. It is more culturally aligned to the PNW. A sunny day here can feel rare, but is absolutely breath taking and stunning. You make peace with the rain and wind and learn to play in all the weather. The bar scene is as others have said it’s not crowded with tourist all the time and really only in the day time. Though personally I enjoy visiting downtown during tourist season. I love that visitors find Alaska to be exotic and are genuinely curious. Downtown, the Valley and Douglas all have different vibes but to be honest you’re very rarely more than 25 minutes away from anyone of those locations at their furthest points. The people here are friendly and truly I believe Juneau has a niche community for everyone. I describe it to outsiders as a small town with a big city vibe. Is it expensive to live here? Sure. Do you lack access to sometimes simple amenities, like quality furniture options? Sure. But you find a way and thanks to Costco and local stores you make it work. I love this city and can’t speak highly enough about how great it is.

"Ive never rented in Anchorage or Seattle, but if I had to pick Id say our housing is more align with Seattle. The atmosphere depends on what area of town you are in.  If I had to make a comparison downtown/ south douglas would be more like Anchorage, more metropolitan, and the Valley would be more like the Matsu Valley, more family homes.  

The tourist crowd is also different that Anchorage in that when the boats leave, so do 95% of the tourists. So, unless you hangout at the bars during the day, the bars aren’t going to be full of tourists. But, you will run into Seasonals-people employed by the tourism industry and are here only for the summer.  It was said in another post, if you want to avoid tourism all together, stick to the Valley and Auke Bay. 

Juneau has a different vibe than Anchorage. In Juneau people work, live and (for the most part) recreate all in Juneau. In comparison to up North where you can live in one town, work in  another, and then recreate in a completely different one.  This has its pros and its cons.

"Juneau local hare. Plenty of folks skin up Eagle Crest when the lifts aren't running. Any of the runs that are typically in bounds are pretty safe avalanche wise. They are aware/encouraging of people doing this and will truly shut an area down if not (check the website though).

"Commenting what I know since others have not. You may be able to rent from a place like boarderline but I'm not sure. Eagle crest is the go-to but as you said, they're not open the first couple of days. Can you just bring your board here? 

If you don't have/can't get access to a splitboard you'll need to strap your board to your back and use snowshoes to hike up the ski hill. If you don't have avalanche training, don't do it. Eagle crest should be treated as the backcountry on non-operating days as there is no avy control. If you do have avy training, check the uphill access section of their website before you go because they will occasionally close the mountain for all access when they're doing work or avalanche control, and that could certainly be the case so close to opening day. 

Haines is a popular heli-skiing destination. You can head up there (totally unsure about board rentals) but I'm fairly certain they do guided heli skiing so even if you don't have avy training experience but you're a really great shredder you should be able to have a good time. Call funny farm in haines for info. 

One other side note. Eagle crest is a very unfriendly mountain (especially ungroomed) for lower 48 beginner and intermediate skiers and snowboarders. Not assuming that you're one of those, but just mentioning it in case. Some parts of the greens at eagle crest would be black diamonds at my home ski hill in the Midwest. Combine that with uncertain snow forecasts and it could be worse. Fresh powder, you'll be fine. Shit snow is a struggle for even really good skiers and boarders.

"Don't count on Uber or Lyft to get around.  It might be available.  Or not.  In the same spirit of uncertainty, plan on getting out no matter the weather.  If the weather sucks (which is entirely possible), I recommend Forbidden Peak for beers + fresh air w/o getting wet.  In addition to brewing excellent beer, they've got fantastic covered outdoor seating with heat lamps.   When clear, the Auke Bay views are stunning.  The breweries downtown are worth a stop too - I really like Barnaby's and Devil's Club.  Just remember - don't try going to a brewery after 8:00 pm because Alaska has really dumb laws about their hours.    
If the skiing isn't in (or even if it is), I recommend checking out the Rainforest Trail.  It has the most accessible old growth forest around Juneau.  And it'd be a shame to visit SE Alaska without seeing the trees.  Fair warning, though, after seeing the Tongass, you won't be nearly as impressed with  Olympic National Park.  The Rainforest Trail is nearly flat and basically at sea level, so it's doable no matter the weather or amount of snow.  The adjacent outer point trail also has at least one beaver dam, which is kinda cool.  Finally, get pizza at the Island Pub in Douglas.  Their pizza is great, not just Juneau good.

"Two main things that come to mind: clothing and costs.
Clothing: Make sure you get good warm waterproof clothes.  I know that's probably obvious if you've looked at our weather- but it's very important.  It rains a lot here, and a thin rain jacket won't cut it.  You want a good rain coat that has insulation, at least a good pair of rain pants, and a few pairs of waterproof socks.  And while a bit pricey, you definitely want Xtratuffs for rain boots.  They are comfortable and handle well on wet wood.
Cost: Plan ahead on what you may need during the school year, buy those items down south, and fill a tote with them.  Simple things like tooth brushes, soap, razors, pain meds, etc.  Juneau is expensive.  While you can buy those items here, it'll be 2-3 times (if not more) expensive than KY.

"Before you get too enthusiastic, keep in mind that traveling with a pet on the Alaska Marine Highway (official name for the ferry) can also be stressful since dogs are not allowed off the car deck unless they are actual service animals like a seeing eye dog (I don’t believe “companion animals count).

This means that they must be in  a vehicle or a kennel/crate the entire time, except for brief port calls where owners are allowed/required to walk them on a designated portion of the steel car deck that is designated for an animal relief area. I don’t believe they are allowed off the boat at all, and they certainly cannot accompany you on the passenger decks or in your cabin. Many dogs have a real problem relieving themselves on the steel deck, it seems unnatural when they have been housetrained not to eliminate in side houses or structures.

"I visited there earlier this month.

* Deckhand Dave's Fish Tacos are excellent.
* Captain's S'mores right next door is an enjoyable dessert option.
* Pel'meni looks like a dive, but the food is very good. Be sure to ask for the sour cream if you go with a spicy option. They will do yours half-and-half of meat and potato dumplings, if you want.
* If you don't mind cooking, you can get good, locally-caught seafood. Make sure you know how to prepare it; I had to pull a lot of bones from the skin-on salmon filet I got.
* If you only need small amounts of herbs and spices, go to the Harbor Tea & Spice Company, on the ground floor of the old Senate building (just down the street from Deckhand Dave's).

"I know I've top commented before but it's lunchtime and I finally read the article.

&#x200B;

>Next month, at the first board meeting after the election, the board will consider a policy that would allow for surveillance testing of unvaccinated students to help cut down on virus transmission.

Sounds like random drug testing. While I've always been on the fence about the issue at least the random is only for athletes. So you could say it's somewhat of an opt in program. Random covid testing of unvaccinated students and staff is plainly an invasion of privacy and harrasment.

&#x200B;

>Spratt and Buzard both support allowing parents to choose the mitigation measures that apply to their students.

Absolutely.  Only you know what is safe and appropriate for you and your child.

&#x200B;

>Spratt said that he believes mandatory masking and surveillance testing harm student’s mental health and that current policies are out of proportion to the risk students face from the virus.

Yep. See my point earlier.

&#x200B;

>Buzard said that the school policies represent tyranny and that school board members are not ‘petty tyrants.”

A man of strong words. But he's right.

&#x200B;

>Fellow write-in candidate Kyle Scholl favors exploring a potential middle ground that requires students to wear masks when they are out of their seats but lets them take them down when seated at their desks.

"I wouldn't say ""good""- but there are some positives.  For one- it allows pets.  Most rentals don't.  It was the only place we could get that would allow two dogs.  It's a great location downtown.  It also has short term rentals available, so you're not locked into a year lease.  We were able to terminate our four month lease early with very little penalty (we terminated because we located a house).  Rent is fairly high- but in line with most rentals in Juneau.  Also- for as many people that live there, I was shocked how quiet it was at night.  I never heard my neighbors- but I saw them.
The bad: The building is not in great shape.  I know they had fire alarms and sprinkler system issues multiple times last year.  It's an older building and definitely has that smell.  We had a homeless guy living under the stairwell when we were there (management finally caught on and kicked them out).  
Overall- it's not the best option, but certainly not the worst.",t2_gnhyy,Piqquin,0,1631319001.0,0,t1_hcdm0c6,hcdm0c6,True,waterloocowsgomoo,t3_plvosj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Juneau/comments/plvosj/can_anyone_give_me_an_idea_of_whether_mendenhall/,Can anyone give me an idea of whether Mendenhall Tower is a good place to rent from?,/r/Juneau/comments/plvosj/can_anyone_give_me_an_idea_of_whether_mendenhall/hcdm0c6/,14,r/Juneau,0,14

I know a lot of people write this off as a guarantee, but remote work in tech is only guaranteed for that job. If he needs to change jobs he might find the timezone in Juneau (~PCT -1) makes that more difficult. Even remote jobs often restrict to a set of timezones, and lower 48 timezones are the most common. He'll find another job, he just won't have the same range of choices, meaning a compromise on pay, working hours (1-3 hours later) or general career is more likely.

"The schools here are great, you aren’t going to find a lot in the way of preschool unless your kid qualifies for an IEP. All-day preschool will cost at least $900 but more like $1200, preschool in the school district is $200/month for 2 hours/day. I can’t speak about common core or class sizes since my kids attend the public Montessori elementary. The curriculum is so different from a standard classroom and the classes are blended with 3 grades per class/teacher. We have a few programs that are public schools but smaller and require an application/lottery to get in. 

We send our kids to school with outdoor clothing for whatever the weather is. It’s very rare for recess to be moved into the school gym or something. All kids have to have snow gear and rain gear and boots. Hats and gloves. 

The homeschool programs have teachers on staff that families are assigned to who helps the families pick out curriculum and then check in each month and quarter on progress. Some of the programs offer more community building than others, like book clubs and robotics clubs and social groups for older kids. We have a co-op preschool but nothing along those lines for home schooling above preschool.

Turns out, actually living through it [EV.ER.Y.DAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/Juneau/comments/imkgom/in_the_last_12_months_juneau_airport_has_seen/) is something else.

For the first ~2 years I was here, it was great. Cool and rainy some days, warm and sunny other days. It was almost too hot! Like why did I move all the way to Alaska to be hot and sweaty?

And then 2020 happened. Not even talking about covid, the weather here was just endless clouds/rain. By 2021, I was ready to pack it up. Would probably be gone by now if it wasn't for the pandemic. Now, I'm not so sure. Maybe I needed to experience the bottom to truly appreciate this place. Maybe it was the realization that everywhere sucks. At least we're not on fire!

The State has a major revenue problem. Between sweetheart deals to oil companies (passed by legislators who are often on big oil's payroll) and the lack of an income tax, the state's ability to raise money to keep the government running has been fraught. The State government has already been pared down to bare bones, with major indiscriminate cuts causing issues with the ferry system, education funding, essential services, etc. Then there's the Permanent Fund and the PFD, which are under threat and would require a massive explainer to really delve into. The State has been draining its savings to dangerous levels because there's no appetite for new revenue and because the state economy has been poor for over a decade now.

"We moved out of state partially because we have no faith in the school system in AK. State government is far too erratic to ensure that the kids will always have access to quality schooling, and that teachers/staff will be supported. 

You'll need the car if you truly want to enjoy the place. I personally think boats are a burden but plenty of folks have them and enjoy them. I wouldn't recommend flying around Juneau in a personal aircraft. SE Alaska is notoriously dangerous for small planes. Even the most experienced bush pilots have a much lower life expectancy. It's not worth it if you're not doing it for a job.

Some other commenters have given good advice. I'll echo that you'll want a SAD light for the winters. The natural beauty is unmatched, but people who grow up in Juneau are raised to respect nature and to operate with an abundance of thoughtful caution. Survival skills training is important if you're going to spend time outdoors camping, hiking, etc. Every year there are multiple stories of tourists and transplants who act stupidly and either get themselves killed or necessitate a dangerous rescue that puts the responders at risk. Locals cannot stand that selfish shit, so I always stress this point when asked about the culture of living here.

Let's see, what else... If you or a family member has a lingering medical issue, living in an isolated place like Juneau isn't a great idea. Our regional hospital is nice, but definitely not equipped for major issues. Lots of folks fly to Seattle or Anchorage for medical care. It adds up 

Juneau is two different cities depending on the season. If the cruise ships are in town, then downtown is kicking and there's lots to eat and see, and there's a ton of storefronts selling a mixture of cool stuff and useless crap. Keep in mind only 30,000 people live in Juneau, and much fewer than that in downtown by the docks, so on a day when there's four cruise ships the population basically doubles. Once the cruise ships leave, most of the businesses downtown by the docks will board up until spring, making it feel a bit like a ghost town there. From January to April, the main focus is the legislature. From April to September, it's cruise ships and tourists. From October to December it's surviving the worst autumnal weather imaginable.",t2_6l3dj,HomelessCosmonaut,0,1627055292.0,0,t1_h69e8it,h69e8it,True,[deleted],t3_oq1unz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Juneau/comments/oq1unz/moving_to_juneau/,Moving to Juneau,/r/Juneau/comments/oq1unz/moving_to_juneau/h69e8it/,6,r/Juneau,0,6

"I moved here a year ago; here are the things that surprised me…

The rain is real, it never storms, but the rain is almost always falling. It’s not uncommon to get the afternoon off work when it’s nice out because it is that rare.

The darkness is real. I still had all the sun in me from down south over the winter but there was a point where I noticed all my friends getting slow and low about the same time in winter. Knowing the days were short, I wasn’t prepared for how late the sunrise was.

Housing is expensive and houses are being bought up immediately for cash. If you are buying, expect to shop for a long time.

Groceries are expensive and rare. We don’t have a road that connects us to the outside, everything is barged in (on tuesdays I believe) so if you don’t buy some items (produce specifically) midweek, you won’t find them on the weekend.

Restaurants are EXPENSIVE and honestly, not all that good! You WILL be good at cooking. Dominos pizza doesn’t honor coupons, what costs 7 dollars down south is 20 here. Other pizza options are woeful.. there’s no good Mexican food.. Well, I hear one is good but it is literally NEVER open when I try to go. (Do businesses here hate making money? Haha)

I guess everyone buys their clothes online? Or at Costco? ..Fred Meyers? Theres some okay outter gear stores, but they are expensive and have limited stock.

All that said, I love it here. It truly is breathtakingly beautiful: clouds form right off the mountains, nature abounds, the way the light hits the glaciers and makes them glow an iridescent blue, the rushing rivers, that one waterfall that cuts down Roberts, the cleanest air, the greenest lush forests and the silent pure fallen snow (that occasionally crystallizes and glitters). The people and community are wonderful, everyone is genuinely kind and looks out for each other. Needs always seem to get met as “Juneau provides.”",t2_9j5ve,wakenbacons,0,1627052615.0,0,t1_h698161,h698161,True,[deleted],t3_oq1unz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Juneau/comments/oq1unz/moving_to_juneau/,Moving to Juneau,/r/Juneau/comments/oq1unz/moving_to_juneau/h698161/,5,r/Juneau,0,5

"Yes, absolutely need a car.  I guess if you live downtown, it's possible not to own a car, but you definitely want one to get around.  Boats are definitely nice.  Planes are not necessary- you can usually charter for a reasonable price.  But if you're into planes, go for it.
Rentals are hit and miss, and as mentioned- EXPENSIVE.  Some people advertise on social media (Facebook).  Craiglist also has them.  I wouldn't rely on just zillow.  There are also a few complexes in town, but they're not great (Mendenhall Towers, Marine View).
I don't have kids, so I really can't comment on the school system.  I know some teachers and staff and there are some really great ones...and some maybe not.  My impression is we're not the best in the State, but way ahead of the curve.  But it may always be different year to year.
I'd come up in the winter just to be sure this is where you want to be.  I absolutely love everything about Juneau: it's an outdoor paradise.  But it can be tough on a family during the winter.
