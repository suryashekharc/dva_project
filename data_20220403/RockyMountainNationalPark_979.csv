"I was there all last week and hiked every day (Im a volunteer there). The Bear Lake lot hikes are crowded and *please* wear spikes. The number of unprepared people amazes me. Slipping and sliding dangerously. I saw a woman in high heels! The snow is packed deep on that trail (to Emerald) and will not be difficult if you have spikes. Once past Dream Lake the crowds thin a lot. I also recommend Fern Lake trail. You have to walk from the parking lot to the trailhead now as road is closed. It is slushy if you arrive on a sunny afternoon. But the hike is lovely and very few people. Also Deer Mountain is a great little hike, great views of the Mummy Range and easy. My personal favorite is Ypsilon Lake which is a bit longer but great and with spikes you'll have no trouble. I encourage people to discover the other places, not just the BL corridor hikes.

"A lot depends on your hiking endurance level. A few awesome short hikes are Emerald Lake, Lake bierstadt (begin at Bear Lake), Mills Lake, Loch vale, and Lake haiyaha. If you’re not sure of how far you want to go, you may want to go to Mills or the Loch and keep going from either one to Black Lake or SkyPond respectively. Just be aware that Sky requires a short climb that may not be safe due to ice. Also, the trail beyond those lakes may require snowshoes. The trails on the shorter hikes usually get broken right after a snow and are usually packed enough for just spikes. Also, remember that the further you go, the fewer people you see—hiking alone is generally safe (especially on those shorter hikes) but if it’s windy and/or snowy it’s probably not a good idea to tackle a longer hike if you don’t know the area. The wind can cover your tracks quickly leaving you without a trail to return by. This shouldnt be a problem on the short hikes as they are pretty popular and there will be people everywhere!!

"I’m there this week volunteering. It’s Spring Break so lots of people. Bear Lake lot filled everyday I’ve been here (sun-tues). Today is overcast and should snow later today but only 1-2 inches are forecast. 
Yesterday the Dream Lake to Emerald Lake was a mess. Lots of slush in sunny spots as the day went on. 2/3 of the visitors are totally unprepared. Hiking with tennis shoes without tread means slipping and sliding and making it dangerous for everyone. Definitely the early morning is good cause the slush freezes and you can walk easily over the ice w/ microspikes. You won’t have any problems getting to Emerald Lake. Trail is well packed down. 
For an alternative hike, yesterday I hiked the Fern Lake trail to the Pool just to check conditions. It’s a great little hike (<2 miles in) thru an area that experienced significant burn Two years ago. It’s a great hike and there were no other people. I saw a moose. It’s close to the campground. Also did Ypsilon Lake. That’s a bit more of a hike but pretty and well packed. That Bear Lake area is so crowded it’s not so pleasant. But cold and snow can keep many tourists away.

Glacier Gorge is great but get there early, early to avoid the timed reservation and to get parking. You can go Loch Vale on to sky or Mills Lake on to Black Lake.

Ute trail is also nice, pretty flat, but as of last year I think it was closed after 2 miles. Not sure what it will be like this summer.

Wild Basin is less crowded and stunning. more of the hikes there are alpine lake-types, not as many summits, unless you’re using a trail to do an approach and then bagging a peak. You didn’t say how experienced you were or how far you were willing to hike, but many of these types of summits would probably be 15-20+ miles for the day.

"What you pack Depends on which trails you are planning on hiking. 
 Trails at higher elevations(over 8,000 ft.) Snow pack is still very likely in May. You would do well to pack a traction device(yaktraks, mirco spikes) and trekking poles. Lower evelations you should be fine. I actually have a few wilderness camping trips in the park planned for May at lower elevations so snow is usually not a problem. 
Just be sure to bring plenty of food and water. Also use Sunscreen frequently! Even if it is completely overcast, you will burn up quick, even if the sky is completely Grey! 
 The Golden Rule for hiking in the Rockies is dress in layers. Usually a thinner synthetic base layer that drys quickly and keeps sweat off your skin. A warm mid layer and a wind/water resistant shell.

"In the winter, RMNP is basically two parks separated by a 3+ hour drive to get from one to the other - Trail Ridge road, which connects the E and W sides of the park, is closed for the winter and won't re-open until about Memorial Day.

If you have your heart set on camping inside the park, then Moraine Park campground is your only choice, and the town of Estes Park is where you'll want to hole up. Typical tourist-trap town as found on the outskirts of major national parks. You should be able rent or buy any camping or hiking gear you may need, and fairly easily find a hotel and places to eat. Maybe check out YMCA of the Rockies in Estes Park - they have a large compound right on the edge of the park - you \*could\* stay there and then hike or snowshoe right from your room to various nearby places in the park and not even have to move your car. The E side of the park gets far less snow (vs. W side) and I've found some places to be hikable in just hiking boots). Highly depends upon the area/trail and how much snow has fallen.

If you are willing to forego the camping inside the park thing, and want more snow, then consider visiting the W side of the park (much snowier vs. the E side) and stay in Grand Lake. GL is much smaller than Estes Park and will have far fewer choices of hotels, restaurants, places to rent/buy gear, etc (especially in winter - many businesses close during the winter). AirBnb and VRBO are worth looking into for places to stay \[I won't visit GL without eating at least once at Sagebrush BBQ\] Do your research in advance as to whether or not there's a place in town to rent snowshoes or xcountry skis - or bring your own. Hiking (i.e. just boots) is probably not feasible - too much snow. Snowmobiling is a big thing in Grand Lake - you rent in town then drive the snowmobile up the main street to the national forest lands just outside town (snowmobiles not allowed in RMNP). Driving (from I-70 exit) to Grand Lake can be dicey if a snowstorm is happening or has just happened - at other times the road is pretty well plowed and drivable by any ordinary vehicle.

Beware the frequent vehicle restrictions inside the park (park's Twitter feed is your friend) - when it starts snowing (and it's been quite snowy lately), the park puts restrictions in place - AWD/4WD required, and/or certain types of tires, etc. Also be aware of the ['traction' requirements](https://www.codot.gov/travel/winter-driving/tractionlaw) for driving I-70 in the mountains in winter.",t2_9smcca99,RowenaOblongata,0,1646607956.0,0,t1_hzmuwr0,hzmuwr0,False,getrichortrydieing,t3_t7ti7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/RMNP/comments/t7ti7q/looked_at_website_still_confused_on_camping/,"Looked at website, still confused on camping availability",/r/RMNP/comments/t7ti7q/looked_at_website_still_confused_on_camping/hzmuwr0/,2,r/RMNP,0,2

"Perhaps it could be clearer, but RMNP's website is correct about campgrounds. You don't say but assuming 'right now' means fairly soon and not in the main season, your only choice is Moraine Park - the website does say (for Moraine Park campground) ""Available first-come, first-served in winter"". Expect snow, cold, possibly icy roads, and probably no water at the campground.

Good tent, preferably lightweight and smaller (2-3 person if you’re not going alone). There are some good choices at REI.

Bear spray is a must

You’re still supposed to have an entrance pass and It’s still cool to financially support the park even if a guard isn’t checking. (Few instances where I’m happy giving the government my money).

"NP. I love the park, live nearby, have been going to it for 20+ years, and am happy to answer questions in this sub. 

You can make a really nice (7-8 mile) one-way hike starting at Bear Lake, then branching off of the lake loop (at which point you leave the crowds), hike to Bierstadt Lake, then hike onwards to Cub Lake, then onwards to the Cub Lake shuttle bus stop where you can pick up a bus back to Glacier Basin campground. Aside from maybe the first half mile, this hike is mostly level or downhill. Plenty of trails start from Bear Lake, many (e.g. Nymph/Dream/Emerald Lakes) will be overly crowded but many you'll mostly have to yourself for good stretches of the time. Check out the [map](https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/maps.htm) of Bear Lake area for distances and elevation changes

Backcountry camping has to be done in one of the established backcountry sites (you can't just camp anywhere), and those are extrememly competitive to get.

"You should plan on carrying water for the full length of your hike. If your hike involves a lake or stream you *could* carry a water filter and refill from there but I think it's just as easy to carry all the water you need. 

Being that you are staying in Glacier Basin campground, the main Bear Lake corridor shuttle bus lot is a 10 minute walk just across the road from your campground - if you are doing any of the hikes that the bus route serves, then leave your car at the campsite and use the bus, b/c parking at almost all of the trailheads along Bear Lake road is a (pun intended) bear - the Bear Lake parking lot has been known to completely fill by 5am, which is even more the case now that people without reservations will be flooding into the area before 5am when reservations are necessary. As for parking further afield... like at the various pullouts along Trail Ridge Road, that's not as much as a problem, depending upon time of day. And if you do drive Trail Ridge Road (highly recommended) up to the Alpine Visitor center, then keep going and visit the west side of the park - far less crowded, a completely different eco-system, chances of seeing a moose are far higher vs. E side.

"I've not looked into it, but if you think you're paying too much due to the convenience of picking up the car at the airport, perhaps pick it up in Denver instead. It's easy to get from the airport to Denver - there's a bus that runs at least once/hour, and there's also light rail that probably runs even more often (both bus and light rail go straight to Union Station, which is where Amtrak passengers get on/off so there's almost certainly rental cars available there). Busses also run from the airport to other places (e.g. Boulder) so perhaps you could get a rental cheaper elsewhere. Of course factor in the cost of the bus/rail ticket from airport to wherever and back.

I'm about to head to the airport myself and I can't say enough good things about the convenience and low cost of the RTD bus. I haven't driven to or parked at the airport in probably 15 years.

"Keep in mind that if you are unable to get a pass for a given day, the '5am' that people mention applies only to the Bear Lake corridor. For the rest of the park, you can get thru the gate without a pass at any time before 9am. You still have to pay the park entry fee or produce an annual pass, etc if the booth is staffed, which generally is the case starting around 7am

If you can get all of the passes you want when they go on sale the 1st of the preceding month, then super. But if not... I've had good luck getting 'day before' passes that go on sale at 5pm the day before.

"Wyoming in the middle of Sept should be fantastic. The mountains are spectacular (could have snow tho) and almost no people. Great hiking. Now, Colorado.... plenty of crowds in Sept. The reservation system ends in Oct, so you will need one, unless you do one of two things: enter the main gates before 9am and have access to anywhere in the park ***except*** the Bear Lake Corridor & those parking lots & trails. Or, if you want the Bear Lake parking areas, the only way to do that without the reservation is enter the park before 5am. The booth at the Bear Lake road junction opens at 5am. After that, reservations required. 

If you stay in Estes Park it's easy to get in before 5am. And you will not be alone. Many of the lots fill up then. I would hate to have a reservation for 9am and then discover all the parking lots are full by the pre-5am crowd. But it happens every day.

"Local here. 

Weather: it’ll be chilly, sunny, and there will be snow in the ground up high. The pass is scheduled to be opened Memorial Day weekend, but don’t bet on it.  Freak storms, snow drifts, etc cause it to remain closed or randomly close on you those first two weeks of June.  

The fire damage to the park was pretty bad on that side. Most of the good trails were closed this year. Call the park to see what they think will be open for next year.  

Other Trailheads: East Inlet, Colorado River TH, if you can get to Poudre Lake/Continental Divide do so.  

That said there’s still a ton to do on the west side. Indian Peaks Wilderness is just as pretty, and doesn’t have fire damage. Also check out Devils Thumb area, far east side of Lake Granby, or Winter Park.  From Grand Lake you can do day trips to all of these areas easily. 

I’d have some microspikes handy too.  Ice will stay on the trails in the shade that time of year.  One bad slip and you’ll ruin your trip.

"I spent time on the East Inlet Trail in July and the trails were undamaged and views were beautiful. Don’t recall seeing fire damage from there. Also visited Kawuneeche visitors center and Winding River Resort. Quite a bit of fire damage in that whole area. Agree with other posters that even burned it’s beautiful in a different way, especially at sunrise/sunset. We saw a moose with calf at the resort while on a trail ride. The restaurant Sloopy’s on the west side of Grand Lake seems to be where the visible damage stops near the town. Didn’t go in to the park further on the west side. 

As an aside, we loved our week in Grand Lake. We stayed in a cabin about 4 miles south of town. We saw moose a handful of times near our cabin and fished around the area.  There are many beautiful trails in the area unaffected by fire damage not affiliated with RMNP. We particularly loved Monarch Lake Trail. Dog friendly, and interesting trail that circles the lake… I think the full loop was 4 miles. Next to East Inlet, this was our favorite family friendly trail. I have teenage kids who enjoy the outdoors, but prefer scenic 1/2 day hikes.

The fire damage is severe but only in specific spots on the west side. Driving into the Grand Lake Entrance you’ll be surrounded by fire damage only for the first 5 minutes of your drive or so until you get into the green stuff. Only three trailheads are affected and as far as I know two of those are still open. Wildlife wise I’d say the west side is actually the better bet especially if you want to see moose. The two sides of the park are pretty different with the west side being a bit more of a valley and river ecosystem and the East being a bit more mountainous and dramatic. Another bonus of the west side is far less visitors.

"As beautiful as they are, I'm happy to have never encountered one mostly hiking in the Glacier Gorge area. Only ever driving up to the Bear Lake trailhead. The elk in the park are reasonable animals. Never had a problem with them or felt unsure of where their boundaries were when walking past. I've yet to meet a moose that I can predict. If I act the wrong way it's on me at 35mph with enough power to flip a car. The accounts I've read from people who flee up trees tend to go ""then it violently thrashed the bottom of the tree for 45 minutes before giving up"" and our trees are not healthy.

The pricing seemed similar to other shops but I didn’t dig too deep on that!

You can also ask them if they think the gear is necessary. I told them what hike I was doing and got their input. The guy didn’t even seem to push on poles but I wanted them since my knee issues and I def ended up appreciating the extra support when on the ice… even with the spikes I had like 2-3 instances where my poles saved me lol!

"1. Boulder, CO - We drive I-70, Hwy 40 over Berthoud Pass - same roads you would be driving. Never had a problem.
2. We've done this drive dozens of times, in everything from a rear-wheel drive Toyota Previa minivan to our current 4x4 4Runner. We've never had a problem, not even close to a problem. One thing to keep in mind is that I-70 is basically the only way to get from Denver and the airport to the dozens of ski areas west of the divide. We're talking hundreds of millions (billions?) of tourist dollars (and taxes). There is no road in the state that gets a higher priority for snow removal and treatment with snow melter (chemicals) than I-70 into the mountains. Ditto for Hwy 40 over Berthoud Pass into Winter Park - this road is plowed almost continuously in the winter (when it's snowing) with sand and snow melter applied - it's a modern 3-lane highway (2 lanes uphill, 1 downhill). With that said, yes there *could* be the rare blizzard happening the moment you want to drive those roads in which case there is the potential for the road being closed. If the state does close the road then you bet they will open it ASAP - those ski/tourist dollars again. Consider travel insurance that will cover the costs of any inconvenience. Also consider untold thousands of people come to Colorado each winter, arrive by plane, rent cars, and drive into the mountains, just like you might do, on the same roads you would drive. People do this - you are not about to pave uncharted territory.
3. We always rent a condo when in Grand Lake. We use Grand Mountain Rentals and always rent a unit in the '[Eagles Landing](https://www.grandmountainrentals.com/vacation-rentals/eagles-landing-25)' complex - they are right on the lake with large floor-to-ceiling window walls facing the lake (and a deck) and fireworks - 2 bedroom, covered parking, full kitchen, living room, fireplace, each unit also has a small sauna in the unit. Some of those Eagles Landing units are also available on AirBnb, etc, as are plenty of other places from studios to full-blown houses.  Not a lot of hotels in Grand Lake, probably more and better choices in the privately-owned space.
4. There's more snow on the W side vs. E side no matter what month you're talking. The continental divide makes for two different ecosystems in the same park.

Somebody mentioned the [YMCA](https://ymcarockies.org/Locations/Snow-Mountain-Ranch)... Yes there are things to do there as well. Not sure if doing activities there requires you to stay there (?).

The time of year you're visiting, Colorado's '[traction laws](https://www.codot.gov/travel/winter-driving/tractionlaw)' will apply for driving I-70 into the mountains. I suspect your rental will already comply with those being that you're renting at the airport but you might want to double-check with them.

"People were going before 5am to avoid the reservation system and to get a parking space. These are not going to be issues in November. The afternoon thunderstorms are a summer thing. Winter snow can come anytime of day or night, it's not just in afternoons. Just keep your eyes on weather forecasts and be ready to change plans if necessary. The most important thing is be sure someone knows where you are planning to go & when you expect to return, and check in with them when you're down.

"Just as an FYI on Hot Sulphur Springs, it is very....rustic. It is not going to be a nice comfy resort type atmosphere.  All of Grand Lake in general and the surrounding areas are quite like that, more wild west and much less touristy.

I stayed a week in October and almost everything in town was closed for the season except for a very kid unfriendly bar.

That being said it won't be crowded and it is beautiful and wild. Also the YMCA up there does horse rides that are lovely and fun.

"Thank you for the thoughtful response...but now it's causing me to question where we should stay. Estes Park OR Grand Lake? The biggest concern I have is the potential for poor driving/road conditions. We're coming from LA, have to rent a car (through Turo) to get to RMNP. B/c it's a rental I tend to be much for cautious when driving...the possibility of poor driving conditions just adds another wrinkle.

Out of curiosity, when you head to Grand Lake:

1) Where are you departing from?

2) What type of car do you use (SUV, Minivan, etc)?

3) Do you airbnb or prefer a hotel?

4) The observation you made about snow on the E side, is this true throughout Dec?

"I'll put in a plug for staying in Grand Lake and doing the west side. As others have said... when you plan to visit in the winter you have to pick one side or the other (unless you like driving 3-ish hours around to get to the other side).

We go to Grand Lake every late December and snowshoe on the various trails on the W side, and stay over so as to see the excellent New Year's Eve fireworks display that Grand Lake puts on (they fire them off from a position out on the frozen lake). The town itself is a tourist trap during the summer but takes on a totally different more laid back (and way less crowded) character over Christmas/NewYears

So if you stay on the Grand Lake side, you have many things you can do...

* Snowshoe in RMNP
* Snowmobile - there are many outfitters right in GL, you start your trip right in GL and make your way up the main road to a variety of snowmobile trails in the adjacent forest lands (snowmobiles not allowed in RMNP)
* Frasier Tubing Hill (30 miles from Grand Lake)
* Alpine (downhill) skiing - there's a smallish ski resort in Granby (Granby Ranch - never been there), but I'd drive a little further and go to Winter Park - between it and the adjacent Mary Jane it's yuuuuuuge and there's something for everybody. Winter Park is 35 miles from Grand Lake.
* Nordic (cross country) skiing - check out Devils Thumb Ranch - 30 miles from Grand Lake. Miles and miles of nordic trails
* There's at least one sled dog outfitter somewhere along the road between Winter Park and Grand Lake - I've seen people out with the dog teams
* Ice fishing seems to be a big thing in Grand Lake - probably at least one outfitter that could set you up (?)
* There's a small (very small) outdoor ice skating rink (free) in Grand Lake - used to be that Blue Water Bakery in Grand Lake had a bunch of skates that you could borrow for free (I haven't checked on that in quite a while)
* Hot Sulphur Springs (natural hot spring resort) is about 25 miles from Grand Lake - go for a soak - maybe while the kids are doing something else in town ;-)

The Estes Park (east) side of the park gets FAR less snow than the Grand Lake (west) side. It's been my experience that the Estes Park side has not enough snow to easily snowshoe and too much snow to easily hike. Also be aware that you can't just sled anywhere in RMNP - in fact there's only one place where you actually are allowed to sled - Hidden Valley (the site of an old pre-park ski resort, long since removed) - not allowed anywhere else in RMNP. I've taken the kids there to sled - lots of fun when there is snow but not 100% reliable. Suggest you subscribe to the park's Twitter feed - they frequently tweet about the sledding conditions there as well as other important park info (road closures, etc).

Yes it snows in Colorado and yes we *could* have a blizzard that affects roads between the airport and Grand Lake. But 99% of the time the roads are fine. We have snow plows in Colorado and we know how to use them.

"I'd guess that you'd be fine given your age and stated health. The standard advice is to gradually 'acclimate' - i.e. don't land at Denver airport and then drive straight to the highest point in RMNP (12,000'). But even then you might be totally fine - who knows - everybody's different. Suggest that you plan your 4 days of hikes so that you work you way up in elevation - save the one with the highest elevation for your last day. 

Another thing to keep in mind... you're not going to Everest base camp where it takes days to evacuate if you become ill. If you drive up Trail Ridge road and start feeling effects, you just turn around and drive back down - you can go from the Alpine visitor center (12,000') to Estes Park (7500') in about an hour.

Speaking of Estes Park.... Compare it vs. the other typical place to stay which is Grand Lake. Estes is about 7500' elevation, Grand Lake is 8300', so perhaps coming from sea level you'd feel less stressed staying in Estes (?). 

I live at 5500', about an hour from Estes Park, and about 2 hours from the highest point in the park.

Good advice and I concur.  Last weekend I had a 2:00-5:00 pass into BL road.  Got to the BL Trailhead parking, there were @ 5 spots open.

"Your timing is a little unfortunate because Oct 11 is the last day of timed entries till next summer season starts. But… you can enter the Park before 9am without a timed entry because the booth isn’t manned. You still need a general National Park pass, but you can get that online. If you enter the park before 9, you will see another booth at the turnoff to BLR. That will have a person though. If you want to go down the BL road without a timed entry you need to go before 5am. In the summer the parking lots full up before 6 st the latest, often by 4:30am. But there are lots of hikes you can do that don’t need BearLake road access. 
Anyway, given your day 2 is oct 11, they may just let you down bear lake rd before your entry time. Depends on how crowded it is. Having said all this, Emerald Lake is a beautiful and easy hike. If you go into the bear lake corridor at your 2:30 pm time, you’ll easily have enough time before dark to do that lovely hike. Dream Lake is my favorite lake in the park, and over the past 25 years of hiking there I’ve seen them all. You’ll go right by Dream Lake on the way to Emerald.

"Agree about what others said on TRR - this time of year its status is dicey and can change at a moment's notice. If you drive from one side to the other, keep an eye on the weather so as not to get stuck on the other side by a sudden road closure - it is a looooooong way around (probably 3-4 hours) to get back to your preferred side should you get stranded. TRR closed unexpectedly less than a week ago due to weather and I believe it stayed closed overnight. At some point the park will close it and it will stay that way until next season. 

Subscribe to the park's Twitter feed - it is the first place the park announces road closures, re-openings, and other things that may impact your plans. The park is lousy about advertising late-breaking stuff on their website

"I took a trip to RMNP during the last major shutdown (Nov. 2018, I believe) and stayed in Moraine Park Campground.

If you can’t make it into Bear Lake, you might try Longs Peak trailhead. If you’re not industrious enough to do Longs, you can do Chasm Lake or Estes Cone off the trailhead.

At that time of year, weather will determine road access as much as government shutdown. If it snows overnight, a government shutdown may mean no staff to clear the snow and reopen the road.

"Unless you have mobility issues or are extremely pressed for time, I'd skip Bear Lake, especially since you already have Mills Lake on your list. Go see some other lake(s). Bear Lake is overrun with tourists, the path around it is paved (read: strollers), and you can walk around the whole thing in probably 20 minutes.

I second the Old Fall River road (if still open) to the top followed by Trail Ridge Road back down (if open). This time of year the road can open/close at a moment's notice - sooner or later the park service will throw in the towel and pronounce it closed for the season. Good luck. And be warned (as it's happened to me). If you are on the wrong side of the divide when they close the road, you could become trapped overnight or longer - it is a looooong way around via I-70, Winter Park, Berthoud Pass, etc from one side of the park to the other.

Go up Old Fall River Rd to the visitors center. Go past the visitors center to the next turnout (Medicine Bow Curve has a great view IMO) before turning around and heading down Trail Ridge.

"Grand lake side is good too, Holzwarth Ranch is worth a stop if you have time to get some history of the park. 

Since you’re not avid hikers, what I would do is get to the park before 9am...you can enjoy the drive over the road, and hit up some of the overlooks, there’s also a short trail at the rock cut overlook that’s got incredible views. Once you’re on the west side you can stop at Poudre Lake, go to Holzwarth, and then do the short walk to Adams Falls. Spend the day in Grand Lake, maybe get some food or even rent some kayaks if it’s in your budget. Then after 3pm you can re-enter the park and drive back to Estes.

EDIT: this is all just an alternative to wild basin. I love wild basin and it’s one of my favorite spots in the park, don’t get me wrong. You wouldn’t go wrong there as long as you get there early enough to park, but I think if you wanted to get an idea of how diverse the park is without putting a ton of miles on your feet, this is a good way. 

The other alternative is Lily Lake as you mentioned but even before timed entry that would get full quick and would hardly take you any time unless you managed to get some climbers to tell you about the “secret” trail to the climbing area, but that’s hard to do ;) The gem lake/twin owls area is also really cool but most people are after that “in the middle of the mountains” feel and those trails just don’t really give you that.",t2_1brohqdk,sunlit_cairn,0,1629980347.0,0,t1_haeyt8o,haeyt8o,True,rocktown_native,t3_pbdwjo,https://www.reddit.com/r/RMNP/comments/pbdwjo/favorite_spots_outside_bear_lake_corridor/,Favorite Spots outside Bear Lake Corridor?,/r/RMNP/comments/pbdwjo/favorite_spots_outside_bear_lake_corridor/haeyt8o/,2,r/RMNP,0,2

"You can enter the park itself anytime before 9 AM or after 3 PM without a timed entry reservation. There is an additional checkpoint at the turnoff onto Bear Lake Rd that requires its own reservation between 5 AM and 6 PM.

Lily lake has an easy, flat, 1 mile, accessible trail around the lake. Gem Lake is a popular hike, not too long (4 mi round trip) but some elevation gain and a ""stair-master"" section. And there are several nice, short hikes in Wild Basin area (like Copeland Falls). These are all outside the ""main"" park entrance (Wild Basin does have an entry station checkpoint).

If you're not into hiking, a drive up Trail Ridge (or up Old Fall River and back down Trail Ridge) is nice. I'd start in the morning to give yourself plenty of time ...

More people on the trail on the way back but they were going up the trail and I was going back to the parking lot, so never saw any of them for long and it was *far* from crowded. The trail is in/out so you can hike as far as you like then just turn around. The trail is relatively flat (the worst uphill part comes at the very beginning and is over with in 5 minutes). If you like destinations make Lulu city your goal - 3 miles to get there. There's absolutely nothing there but a sign and a few cabin remains but you can read up on it before the hike and then imagine what it must have been like in its heyday when you get there. There's a cemetery there but we didn't find it (might not be marked) and I doubt it has anything to see (prob had wooden grave markers that are long gone?).

"As far as safety, I’ve hiked and camped alone in the park as a pretty experienced female. 

My basic safety tips for solo backpacking, and forgive me if this is obvious to you, but you never know what someone means by “moderately experienced”. Whatever route you do, give a trusted friend a detailed route of your map, and a check in time when you’re done. Do not veer away from your planned route unless you can reach them to tell them, and you hear back. You’ll likely not be able to check in on your hike because of cell service (spotty at best) but someone you trust will know when it’s been too long but also won’t freak out and call SAR because they “just have a feeling” (looking at the nervous moms of the world). Something like an InReach and iodine tablets are never a bad idea to have, and it sounds pessimistic but wear brighter colors (not earthtones or white/black) just in case you end up in a situation you need to be easily visible from. 

As far as your routes, I’d immediately rule out longs peak unless you’ve done it before in mid-September. I’ve done it solo, but depending on how quick the weather changes you’re already risking ice patches on the homestretch that time of year. Camping in the Boulderfield even if you just go to the keyhole is a cool experience that’s some good type 2 fun, but I think the others are gonna be more “worth it”. 

Bear lake to north inlet is a solid hike. I did it in a day and continued on to grand lake, so it’s not *too difficult* (still a big hike but you’ll enjoy it and won’t be in apparent danger 😂), and the extra 1/2 mile or so to summit hallet’s from flattop is definitely worth it. I’d do that one if I were you, but that being said....

I haven’t done the 3rd option. I know people who have done it who enjoyed it greatly, but can’t give you any first hand experience.

"Confused on your question a bit but here’s what I think you mean:

Alberta falls, emerald lake, and sky pond are all in the bear lake corridor. So for those you’ll either need to enter before 5am or only during your timed entry.

Ouzel falls is in wild basin. You’re set there as long as you go before 9am or within your timed entry. 

Bridal Veil Falls is in one of those weird “within the park boundaries but not past an entrance” places (at the cow creek trailhead). I can’t speak for this year but last year the road was “closed” unless you had a timed entry permit, but they weren’t checking. To be safe I put my timed entry on my dashboard to be visible through my windshield while I was hiking. 

If you’re planning to do it all, that’s a lot for one weekend with working around timed entry. You’ll find less crowds at ouzel and bridal veil.

if falcon lake was your destination and you didnt want to tag on fan falls (since you can see it across many meadows along the way) go to the back of thunder lake and follow the unnamed creek up to a large pool where the fan falls tributary and falcon lake tributary meet, and follow the left stream all the way up. it isnt awful because of all of the wildflower meadows. totally reccomend!!!",t2_3krpljpv,fleza_,0,1628600706.0,0,t1_h8em6if,h8em6if,False,fleza_,t3_ozdxoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/RMNP/comments/ozdxoq/falcon_lake_located_in_wild_basin_only_accessible/,Falcon Lake located in Wild Basin • only accessible by bushwacking an extra 3/4 mile above thunder lake. complete serenity!!,/r/RMNP/comments/ozdxoq/falcon_lake_located_in_wild_basin_only_accessible/h8em6if/,1,r/RMNP,0,1
"To add to what everyone is saying -- location and proximity is a big deal. Arvada to the big trailheads (Glacier Gorge, Bear, etc) is about 1.5-2 hrs.

"For 2022, there are no real answers - only guesses based upon what happened last year and what's happening this year. The reservation thing was new as of 2020, a response to COVID. There initially were no plans to continue it into 2021, so we locals were somewhat surprised when the park announced in the spring that the system was returning for 2021. The  reasons that the park has given for continuing it into 2021 are either 'confused' or 'inconsistent' at best. At times the park is playing the COVID card reason (e.g. 3/5ths of the park campgrounds are closed in 2021 due to COVID - I call BS), at other times it's the overcrowding card reason. Admittedly the park \*is\* overcrowded and it was probably inevitable that something would be done about that.

But will the timed reservation system be back for 2022? My guess will be yes, but since politics plays a role here the real answer could be anything: yes, no, or yes but different in some way. The 2021 system is different from the 2020 system in many ways and I would bet $$$ that they'll tweak it again it if it returns for a 2022 encore.

If 2021 is any guide for 2022... put a reminder on your Google calendar or phone to buy your tickets the INSTANT they go on sale. If 2022 is the same as this year, (a) they release a given month's tickets on the 1st of the preceding month (e.g. August reservations go on sale July 1st) and (b) they hold back 25% of each day's tickets, only making them available at 5:00PM the day before. They go VERY quickly - last Friday I was logged into the [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov) website at 5:00:00 just to watch the activity. At exactly 5:00:00 (and I mean EXACTLY - use your cell phone's clock which is synced with the NIST atomic clocks) there were about 200 tickets available for each time window. I continued to refresh my browser page and watch the counts - by 5:01:30 they were all gone.  Do not try to get tickets using the [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov) phone app - it is buggy AF and will show you that zero reservations are available when in fact hundreds are available.

If getting reservations fails, then be aware of other options: (a) enter the area before or after reservations are required (b) buy a 'service' in the area (e.g. rent a space at a campground, book a horseback ride, etc), the printed confirmation of that service serves to get you in (c) bike or walk in.

There are plenty of accommodations in Estes Park and Grand Lake - cheap is a matter of opinion, but June is the beginning of peak season so if you want to go that route don't dawdle in making your reservations and expect to pay peak-season rates. Kill two birds with one stone - rent a campsite for a few nights - the campground reservation serves as the reservation to get you into the park itself, and you can't stay much closer to the park than being inside of it. Campground sites become reservable exactly 6 months prior to the date you'd be camping (so if visiting in June 2022, reserve your site in Dec 2021). You could arrange to rent camping equipment from places in Estes Park. And for $30/night waaaay cheaper than any place you'll find in Estes Park. I particularly like Glacier Basin campground, it's a 10 minute walk over to the main park and ride where you can catch a shuttle bus to any trailhead along the entire Bear Lake corridor.

"There’s 3 entrances. The two on the east side (Estes park) are beaver meadows and Fall River. I’ve always used beaver meadows for the bear lake corridor but to be honest I don’t really think there’s much of a difference. Maybe check the webcams before you go in to see if one has less traffic. 

One entrance on the left side, grand lake. 

As far as family friendly hikes outside of bear lake, I always saw a lot of kids doing Gem Lake. 

Adams Falls is a short one on the west side, less than a mile. 

Copeland Falls to Calypso cascades is 3.5 miles but only 610ft of elevation gain across the hike. 

At the top of trail ridge road there’s the Toll Memorial Trail, it’s a short walk probably with a lot of people, but not short on views. 

Coyote Valley is also on the west side so you could drive the road going to the hike, it’s about a mile on flat ground with mountains all around you and it’s by the Colorado river and you’ve got a good chance of seeing elk or moose. I’d say you’d have time to do the toll memorial trail on the drive along trail ridge and then keep going to this trail, you’ll get diverse views that way and fulfill your goal of driving the road.

"Sky Pond is a challenging and very rewarding hike with some of the most breathtaking views you can hike in a single day. We were here about a month ago, started at the Bear Lake parking lot and it took us 11 miles total and about 8 hours. Do not fret if you arrive and the Glacier Gorge lot is full, it usually is by 4:30AM and your trek from Bear Lake lot is going to be very similar. Bring lots of water, at least 3L per person and snacks too. 

I would consider this moderate to difficult as a result of the distance combined with the elevation gain. Simple/easy paths from the start to Alberta Falls, moderate up to the loch. Gets difficult afterwards with paths that are fairly rocky and increasingly steep, moleskin was a must for us to prevent blisters.


A lot of people make the mistake of stopping at Lake of Glass right at the top of the waterfall, but it's well worth the extra 1.8 miles total to get to Sky Pond! I highly recommend the Alltrails app and site as that will help guide and mark your path, it is also nice to check conditions as people post about this trail almost every day. I took poles and they were very handy for me, we needed the collapsible ones to clip on to our backpack as you'll be using full body to scale the waterfall.",t2_5oye9,youngsailor,0,1628170621.0,0,t1_h7sy49p,h7sy49p,True,caroplan3,t3_oy6tjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RMNP/comments/oy6tjw/sky_pond_vs_chasm/,Sky Pond vs Chasm,/r/RMNP/comments/oy6tjw/sky_pond_vs_chasm/h7sy49p/,2,r/RMNP,0,2
You'll enjoy it. For that one I recommend showing up before 5. The first 3~ miles of the trail are pretty but not anything special so having an hour of darkness doesn't negatively impact it. During the golden hour you should then have amazing lighting right as you get to the big mountains at Loch Vale.

"Sky Pond is a phenomenal hike in pretty much way I can think of - it’s very popular but I mean, if you put it on a top 5 day hikes in America, I wouldn’t say you’re wrong. During peak season, it will be very crowded and the weather is always iffy in RMNP. I did it in early June and had crampons, poles, etc and still felt like I was in some sketchy situations between Loch Lake and Sky Pond.  In August I assume it’s a lot easier. 

We had perfect weather going up and a crazy hail / wind / snow situation coming down. Both were beautiful and I’m actually kind of glad it stormed on our way down - it was epic, like my god coming back down to loch lake in what felt like a Blizzard, and seeing fresh hail pitter-patter onto the partially frozen lake — really something. 

Chasm lake is a very good hike too. But if you had to pick one, it’s Sky Pond. It’s a lot of elevation gain at high altitude - don’t be a hero and turn around at Loch Lake if you need.",t2_26vbgwol,old__pyrex,0,1628151027.0,0,t1_h7s5jkg,h7s5jkg,True,caroplan3,t3_oy6tjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RMNP/comments/oy6tjw/sky_pond_vs_chasm/,Sky Pond vs Chasm,/r/RMNP/comments/oy6tjw/sky_pond_vs_chasm/h7s5jkg/,2,r/RMNP,0,2
"Sky Pond is my favourite hike in the park. The Y junction it's off of also includes Loch Vale and Mills Lake, two beautiful places directly on and 0.6mi~ off of the trail to Sky Pond. It has a 3-point scramble next to a waterfall that's a bit intimidating but that's it. Because it's on the same trail as Bear Lake and Alberta Falls it's super crowded. 

Chasm Lake is right below Longs Peak which is a remarkable sight that close. You get to see some neat alpine tundra ecology that you won't otherwise encounter unless you do Trail Ridge Road. The hike past Peacock Lake is also probably full of columbines right now, as is Sky Pond. No scrambling but it's a more tiring hike at a higher altitude. If you're coming from the lowlands it will be rough and exposed while Sky Pond is mostly forested and has good places to take a breather along the way.

Bear Lake lot which is huge would be a perfect option, bonus is that they have restrooms at this location if anyone needs to go before the 6-7 hour hike.",t2_5oye9,youngsailor,0,1627994985.0,0,t1_h7jpavx,h7jpavx,True,Jpninja,t3_ovh7qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/RMNP/comments/ovh7qn/best_place_to_park_if_entering_430a_bm_entrance/,Best place to park if entering 430a (BM entrance) for Glacier Gorge TH,/r/RMNP/comments/ovh7qn/best_place_to_park_if_entering_430a_bm_entrance/h7jpavx/,2,r/RMNP,0,2
"We did the Emerald lake hike a few weeks ago and it was one of our favorites, very straightforward and on the easy side. It's only 3.2 miles but the views were some of the best in the Bear Lake corridor (we also managed Sky Pond which was a whole other beast but looking back Emerald lake was a more peaceful hike and still had one of my favorite views). There were a couple people during our slot of 5-7AM on a weekday. Around noon it was very crowded at the base, so as long as you go early it will be less crowded in general.

I would recommend this hike if you have an early morning to spare and want to enjoy some pristine lake scenery!",t2_5oye9,youngsailor,0,1627994667.0,0,t1_h7joqgw,h7joqgw,True,bookieicecream,t3_owqy43,https://www.reddit.com/r/RMNP/comments/owqy43/trail_suggestions/,Trail suggestions,/r/RMNP/comments/owqy43/trail_suggestions/h7joqgw/,1,r/RMNP,0,1

"I think Bierstadt Lake would be perfect for you and your sister. Park at the Park&Ride and catch the bus to Bear Lake - yes it will be crowded at Bear Lake when you get off the bus but you'll quickly leave the crowd behind. Make your way around the lake counter-clockwise until you come to the trail head to Flattop. The trail is uphill for maybe 1/2...3/4 mile but not terribly so. Don't take the turn to Flattop but keep going straight, soon you'll come to the crest of a hill and then the trail is downhill or flat from that point on. Take the turn to Bierstadt Lake and enjoy the lake (there's an officially marked spur trail to the lake on the north side of the trail loop but you can just bushwack your way to the lake at almost any point. I've seen moose and elk at the lake. From the lake you can either take the trail at the far (east) end of the lake and hike directly back to your car, or (my favorite) take the fun switchbacks (INCREDIBLE views) down the moraine to the Bierstadt Lake trailhead and shuttle bus stop then catch the bus back to your car. Probably 4-5 miles but take extra laps around the lake to add mileage if you want. Or go hike around Sprague Lake (you won't have it to yourself but there's plenty of space for all)

Things were typical tourist stroll until the fork at the bridge, then things started getting a bit rougher.

No. The park is open 24/7 but if you get to the entry gate before it's staffed you'll see a 'Please proceed' sign taped to the ranger booth window. Kinda honor system at that point e.g. you buy a pass at the visitor center on your way out. I guess they could technically check for passes on folks exiting and make you buy one then and there if you didn't have one but I've never seen it happen at RMNP. You can buy an entry pass online but those are snail-mail'ed to you so allow time if you go that route.

"Ah... Given the total lack of availability in both of those campgrounds, somebody snagging your last minute cancellation will feel as if they've won the lottery.

I've camped in both and I prefer Glacier Basin. Even though the campground is directly serviced by a shuttle bus, I recommend you don't use it. Instead just walk (10 minutes) from the campground to the main bus lot directly across the street - from there it's a single bus to any trailhead serviced by the shuttle bus system. If you camp in Moraine Park, it's a 2-bus trip to roughly half of the trailheads (you have to transfer at the main bus lot) and, depending upon timing, once you get off of bus #1 at the main bus lot you'll have to get into a lengthy queue to then get on bus #2 to head to trailheads closer to Bear Lake.

Same - wet wading is nice on a sunny day in the summer but can be a bit shocking at first.

"You are correct. We are from Kansas so the time difference was a benefit for us as well! 

If you can hit the park entrance before 9:00am, no timed entry pass is required at all. The guard shack was not manned and everyone just drove by it. :). Just don't leave the park or you won't be able to get back in until 3:00pm. 

If you can get the the Bear lake entrance before 5am, you can access that area also. We were staying on the Grand Lake side of the park, which is furthest from Bear Lake and we didn't make it this trip.

Other than that, I'd just Google to find the various campgrounds in the area, and/or see about staying in a hotel. Also do the same for the west side (Grand Lake) which is typically less crowded, has just as many charms, and there are more forest service campgrounds on that side within just a few miles of the park entrance.

"No way. Long's TH is accessed ""outside"" the park, i.e. you don't need to show any pass or reservation to any ranger to get to that parking lot (unless it's changed since I was last there). Since nobody even needs a timed reservation to enter the park (except Bear Lake area) before 9am, and since people headed up to Long's or nearby things like Chasm Lake will want an early start anyways, I think you could expect your 9am timed entry permit to be of zero value when it comes to Long's Peak TH and its parking lot. And as others have said... this time of year you need to be especially careful of weather that can roll in in the early afternoon. I've been up to Chasm myself this time of year and found myself practically jogging back down the mountain to treeline trying to beat the thunderstorm that came out of nowhere.

"Yes, they are common. You should assume there will be thunderstorms in the area after about 1 PM, and plan accordingly. That way you'll be safe and won't be frustrated if storms do roll in.  

It's roughly 2.5 hours from Denver to Millner Pass, according to Google Maps.  I assume you'll want to stop at least once (for photos, for the bathroom, for coffee) and let's say it will take you 15 minutes once you get there to get out, stretch, load up, etc... before you actually start hiking (nobody ever parks and starts hiking right away, especially with a group. Somebody's gotta take a wizz, somebody's gotta pack their bag, somebody wants to put on an extra shirt, etc...).  So let's call it 3 hours.  Mt. Ida is a little less than 5 miles each way, with roughly 2,000 feet of gain, at altitude.  Unless you are super fit and move really quickly, I think 3 hours is a safe estimate up, 2 hours back down.  Let's say 5 hours, total (longer if you want to hang out at the top for more than 15 minutes or so).  

Here's the thing, most of the hike is above treeline, so you really want to be almost back at your car before possibly dealing with rain and, especially, lightning.  So I'd recommend targeting a 1 PM finish time. That means, to be safe, you should probably start hiking by 8.
