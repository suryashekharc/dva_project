"If you have a cell phone with data then get the parking app. Set your car up once  with your credit card. As soon as you park you just use the app from your car and you‚Äôre good to go. The nice thing about the app as you can be in the store and check how much time you have left and extend the time without going back to your car.

The app also has parking history so you can prove that you paid at a certain time.

"It isn't really weird, no. They pulled that shit all the time, you likely just didn't ever see it because by definition shop only ever saw the work when it came to you, which again you guys did well. If I was told not to put in a work order in until monday, you guys didn't see it until monday. And if the work order wasn't urgent then it didn't get done for months because there weren't enough of you.

In that specific instance, for example, their argument was that the suite was rented as a 2 bedroom. The fact that someone was living in the partially finished basement (which we absolutely knew and were told to use as a selling point) meant that in their view we were not legally responsible to send staff to work overtime on a Friday to deal with the issue, nor were we required to transfer them to a different place while theirs was being cleaned.

The fire marshal disagreed, and we ended up putting them in emergency housing.

Like I'm not sure if your trying to call me a liar or if I'm just reading it that way, but this is stuck so vividly in my mind that I remember the ladies name and her address.

I can keep going. There was the lady who had to live in emergency housing for a month after her neighbor beat the shit out of her in front of her kid where the company refused to take any meaningful steps to evict her or protect the upstairs neighbors. There were houses completely destroyed by the tenants like the one I took Dan to, where Alisa decided to just move her into a new house because she (social assistance) paid her rent and the company only cared about short term cash flow.

"So just to clarify, I'm the employee guy from the CBC story. I know exactly what the houses looked like because I was in them day to day trying to rent them to people.

The employees, particularly the tradespeople, cleaners etc, were not the problem with epic. You guys did what you could with the resources that you had available to you, and if they company had been well run and you'd been provided enough people to actually do the jobs that were put in front of you, you'd be fine.

But for every story like yours I can throw one right back at you about how little management gave a damn. 

Like the time I had to call the fire marshal because the company didn't think a foot and a half of sewage in a pregnant woman's basement warranted OT for a plumber. Or the time I had to move a woman out of her house due to a sewage backup, the emergency house we moved her into didn't have a working furnace and there were no heaters at the shop so she had to sleep in the kitchen in front of an open stove. Or the time that I was told that it could wait till morning when it was so cold out that a woman's doors froze shut and locked her inside her own house.

My complaints are that Alisa and Rochelle were thieves who ran a barebones property management company that could not keep up with the needs of their tenants, which was ultimately funded by stealing from their investors.

I can't see why you'd ever have a problem with that summary of the company.",t2_3a3smqa2,edwardlleandre,0,1648964544.0,0,t1_i36x4f2,i36x4f2,False,Sloofooter,t3_slztvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/slztvb/is_epic_alliance_the_biggest_ponzi_scheme_to_hit/,Is Epic Alliance the biggest Ponzi scheme to hit Saskatchewan?,/r/saskatoon/comments/slztvb/is_epic_alliance_the_biggest_ponzi_scheme_to_hit/i36x4f2/,1,r/saskatoon,0,1

"My friend's kids have fasted since they were pretty young (6-7). The girl was small so she started just fasting every second day or third depending on how she was managing. They still go to school and do all normal activities, but they sat out of some track and field and things. If you drink water, it wouldn't be considered fasting. Even the children didn't break their fast for water, unless of course they were sick.  They did sometimes take days off school here and there because they are too tired/too much activities. This was when the end of the year of school and Ramadan coincided... So there was busy fun activities and very hot days. 

Fasting for Muslims isn't required before puberty, so they didn't strictly have to fast, but they were still strongly encouraged to. Also they usually wanted to. I can't say I really agree with small kids fasting, but not my decision. The kids are older now, in high school.

"I didn't need Tam or any other government salaried expert or politician to inform me of the nature of Covid.

There were early studies (Feb to March 2020) describing SARS-CoV-2 being tracked through ventilation systems, infecting people across large rooms such as restaurants, churches, large offices, and infection patterns that followed HVAC indoor air currents. All of this spoke to airborne transmission. 

I've been wearing an airborne respirator since and using curbside, even for grocery shopping. We could see the success of Asian populations where mask use is not uncommon. We could see how effective Taiwan's planning and emergency preparedness was since 2003 with the first SARS 1. 

Our population is more concerned with Rider Games and who will win the Oscars to pay attention to essential things; therefore, vote for politicians that will invest in the most critical investments. This is the age of the internet. Information is there for all of us to access. There are free online courses if one is unsure how to assess online information.

Overall, I'm disappointed in Canadians. We aren't who we claim to be. Our values are selfishness and materialism.

">something like micro clover. I don't mind watering now and then, have a sprinkler system on a timer. mowing also isn't a concern. once a week is fine and preferred.

grass only needs to be mowed once a week unless you overdose it with fertilizer/overwater.  clover is only seldom mowing, however clover cannot tolerate traffic. If you will be walking on it often, clover will not work (big reason why we use grass).

>complete replacement with something that is zero work. Rocks, rubber mulch and so on.

Doesn't exist.  Rocks need weed barrier replacement to reduce the amount of weeding/prevent them from sinking into the ground. Rubber mulch I don't imagine would would sink without something presses it down, but still needs fabric. Mulch you're not supposed to put weed barrier under it (good screening question for your landscaper), but it fades over time and needs to be fluffed (rotated) to last longer and avoid over compaction.  

Also, as time goes on trees and weeds will go from birds dropping seeds, wind, and the weed barrier breaking down.

"Those are some really good questions, some of them I never heard before.

We try to not do any demanding physical activities during the day. Although studies did show that doing physical activities while fasting have some good benefits. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6983467/)

Sleeping during the day is fine as long as you don't miss the 3 prayers during day time. Because fasting without doing other daily rituals of islam is kinda pointless. So if you are a night shift guy you are kinda in trouble, but people usually manage. Sleep - wake up and do the prayer - go back to sleep - repeat.

Basic rule is, sunrise till sun set, no exceptions. Unless you are sick or fasting would cause you physical harm. Since daylight time rotates, in a life time a person would be eased to all kind of durations of fasting. In Canad, in winter, we fast from 8 am till 5 pm which is really short. Naturally, we pay it back when Ramadan occurs in summer :). And we do make fun of other countries with shorter fasting time, then they ruin it by empathizing with us since they know how hard it would be :).

At the time that we break our fast there isn't any thing special. Normally lots of liquid and a decent meal. Although it is worth mentioning that we add another prayer called Taraweeh to the normal 5 prayers we do daily. It is not as mandatory as the usual 5 but it is only performed as a group in Ramadan, you can do it on your own outside Ramadan. It is performed after the last prayer and last for almost an hour.

I disagree. Her kid would probably still be alive if she wasn't hit by any driver, sober or intoxicated. A distracted driver or sleep-deprived driver can kill equally effectively.

That is a separate criminal offense, but the cause of this child's death is actually still unproven and is statistically actually likely the same as all other causes of child-vs-vehicle deaths in crosswalks; sober people in a rush or distracted.

"I'd say it's safe to assume a lot of my anecdotal experience comes down to luck. Which makes me very fortunate. 

I can see how someone with a limited knowledge of an airborne virus and how it travels would be frustrated about catching covid while following meticulous masking guidelines. It would for sure make the science seem less credible. Omicron, and now deltacron, are so incredibly contagious. 

The R0 of a virus needs to drop below 1.0 (meaning that for everyone infection, that person is likely to infect less than 1 other person) for the virus to go from pandemic to endemic. Measles is the highest documented transmission rate with an R0 of between 12-18 (again, meaning 12-18 people will become infected from each other person infected). Deltacron is estimated to have an R0 of 12.

‚ÄúPossamai said early hesitation on closing borders to international travellers, the resistance to recommending the use of masks for the general public and the impact of a depleted national stockpile of PPE had devastating consequences on Canada's ability to control COVID-19. 

""In case after case, a precautionary approach would have made a difference,"" said Possamai. ""We were not only late in moving in that direction, but there was a real lack of transparency.""

One reason for this type of law is for the safety of the people utilizing the ""vehicle"" to enter/cross the crosswalk far faster than drivers would normally expect someone walking to cross their path.

The driver was legally over the limit, but the legal limit is not related to the actual level of intoxication of a person. The driver could have caused the same level of injury/death if they were high/drowsy on allergy medication or basic sleep deprivation for which there is no criminal-code mandated test.

There is no proof that the criminal-code THC levels were the cause leading to the victims death (ie. too high to drive safely), but I suspect it was actually typical driver distraction.

"I see now that you were not replying to the OP, that was my mistake and means the quoted hyperbole does not apply. But don‚Äôt act like that lends any validity to your original claims of sexism.

Are you honestly complaining about outrage culture, when you started out, by calling out perceived sexism in another person‚Äôs comment? If so, the lack of self-awareness is palpable.

Choosing to interpret being followed around 2 separate stores store by a stranger, as a benign ‚Äúmaybe he‚Äôs security‚Äù, is literally downplaying dangerous behaviour. 

The commenter said ‚Äúwomen cannot do this‚Äù, which you and I chose to understand differently. You chose to call their comment sexist, based on your interpretation. I then said mean things to you, mistakenly going about 25% overboard, because of who I thought your comment had been directed at.

Now you‚Äôre here still acting like the borg, as though original comment can only be interpreted as one way. When simply emphasizing the word ‚Äúcannot‚Äù, over the word ‚Äúwomen‚Äù produce 2 very differ meanings. ‚ÄúWomen‚Äù sounds like a judgment and ‚Äúcannot‚Äù other sounds like a warning.

You act like calling yourself neutral, makes it real, but a neutral mind would‚Äôve asked questions to clarify, not jumped to a conclusion, based on their initial interpretation and made the knee-jerk accusation of sexism. Understand when I say this, I am not pretending to be neutral myself, just saying I can recognize the behaviour when displayed by others and you are not exhibiting it.

The funniest part is, I know I am an asshole on Reddit, as I mostly use it to fight. I am fine with making a dumb mistake, or with admitting it, especially when it has no impact on my actual point.

You on the other hand seem to think you came across as ‚Äúneutral‚Äù, ‚Äúmature‚Äù and totally not ‚Äúfoolish‚Äù, when you chose to interpret the original comment in the most outlandish way possible. 

Like, what would have been the point of their comment, based on your interpretation? Some kind of weird gatekeeping?

Or, just maybe, was it a warning against the kind of thinking they replied to?

"Sgi can repair until damage exceeds 80 percent of the value of the vehicle. Get the value as high as you can with your adjuster and then ask your adjuster for a maximum repair amount letter. You have to find a shop that will repair within that dollar amount or it's a total loss and you won't be able to repair it because it's deemed not road safe at that point.

You can find a list of repair shops here: www.sgi.sk.ca/repairshops

If you can't find a shop to fix it, you can ask your adjuster for a buy back value and ask which inspections are required. You can retain the total loss. So they will pay you the value of the vehicle, less the buy back amount and less your deductible If applicable. You keep the vehicle as is and you need to get the required inspections done at your own cost. If the vehicle can pass the inspections you will technically be driving a total loss vehicle and it won't be worth much on any future claims but you can keep driving and plating it.",t2_178h51,bunnygump,0,1648852024.0,0,t1_i31hezj,i31hezj,True,confusedbytrees,t3_tu0tyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/tu0tyf/car_body_shops_recommendations/,Car body shops recommendations,/r/saskatoon/comments/tu0tyf/car_body_shops_recommendations/i31hezj/,5,r/saskatoon,0,5

"I commented as a reply to another user, but thought I would also generally reply on this article.

The Criminal Code sets out per se limits to the THC concentration in your blood. It's akin to a BAC (Blood-Alcohol Content) reading of being 0.08 or over indicating impairment at law, with several caveats.

The pertinent Criminal Code section 320.14(1)(c) specifies that a person has commit the offence of impaired operation by drug if the person has, within two hours after ceasing to operate a conveyance, a blood drug concentration that is equal to or exceeds the blood drug concentration for the drug that is prescribed by regulation.

The Federal Regulation designates that a THC concentration of 5ng per mL of blood or greater as operating impaired.

Very simply, if the THC in your blood exceeds 5ng per mL of blood, you are operating impaired. It equates to a blood alcohol of 0.08 or higher as it applies to alcohol. It makes no difference - per the Criminal Code - as to when you consumed THC.

This is the first instance I'm aware that a person has been charged as being impaired by THC and causing death. It will be a landmark case in terms of acceptance of evidence. Expert Witness Evidence (from a toxicologist) will likely be tendered by the Defence. I would expect that this will also result in appeals - perhaps up to the Supreme Court regarding this legislation.

Going further, anticipating comments about ""THC staying in your system for 30-days or more"":

As the law currently reads, *it does not matter.* If you are a heavy user of marijuana, and blazed a J the night before, *it does not matter*. If you're stone-cold sober when you wake up and drive to work, the THC content in your blood *could actually be* 5ng or higher as a heavy user. Should you be subject to an impaired investigation and your blood toxicology comes back at higher than the prescribed limits, you could be subject to Criminal charges, even if you haven't consumed any cannabis that day.

All the driver would have seen is cars driving normally and then a child in front of them. Unless there is another video I didnt see? Yea you cant expect a child to be held to the same standards as an adult but if a child isn't smart or capable enough to understand cross walks and the dangers of crossing the street they should be supervised. If someone runs out into the road with no warning and with no visibility child or not its hard to blame the drive just because they are a child. Like I am not taking all responsibility off of the driver, they were speeding and apparently high so that's not a recipe for safety. But there is probably only 2-3 seconds before the child was visible and the collision happened.

"Cannot and can't afford are to different things.

""Women cannot afford the time to swim""

Lol. Not acting like a men's rights advocate.  But interesting you think someone else's rights are worth less than another's.  Also, no persecution complex.  Dial down your outrage culture to recognize a neutral stance.  Issue with people like you is you think if someone isn't publicly and blindly defending something they are against it.  Some people step back, look at all sides, and use logic. 

Example of your blind defending:

>Did you not think your comment, telling a woman stalked through two stores by a creep, that she‚Äôs sexist for telling other women, not to downplay these kinds of things, made that abundantly fucking obvious!?

Never happened.  I never downplayed something, I just didn't persecute blindly.  As I said, I step back and view all sides. 

I never told the woman saying she's stalked that she is sexist.  I told someone else *that isn't op* that their statement was sexist.  Learn the difference, and who the comment is towards before you come in looking foolish by proving you're not paying attention due to blindly defending and persecuting. 

Relax, breath, read, and try to come back to this as an civil, maturebl adult if you want to discuss this.  I will gladly discuss this with you in a calm manner.

honestly if the driver was sober and driving the speed limit she still probably wouldn't be alive if it played out the same way. Ive watched that video like 4 times and the way that truck and trailer are positioned and the fact the driver would not have seen that kid until she was already pushing off into the street. Pretty good chance even if the driver was going 50 and not high that kid gets hit. Like i  expected the brakes to come on right before she was hit and they didnt and that was definitely because the driver was high/distracted but even if they did hit the brakes when you think they should have there was no where near enough time to slow down more than 10km before that kid is hit.

"This isn't a hard truth I don't want to see. You misunderstand children and their level of responsibility. If this was an adult, yes you'd be correct. But it wasn't. It was a child.

Yes, she should have looked, but a 9 year old doesn't have the capacity to protect themselves and see all possibilities like an adult can. She was crossing at a crosswalk where cars had already stopped for her. She had trust in the systems put in place to protect her, like the crosswalk, like the cars that had already stopped.

There have been several times I have stopped for pedestrians at a crosswalk and someone flies by in the right lane. I've almost been hit in that way, in a crosswalk, but as an adult, I looked and I'm alive. Days after this accident happened, I was driving on 33rd and someone did the exact same thing, sped by the vehicles lined up and that vehicle ran a stop sign. Days after a child was killed at the same intersection. 

A nine year old child is beholden to the adults around them for protection. The responsibility is fully on the adult who was driving and didn't assess why the vehicles beside them were stopped. The adult was not proceeding cautiously. The adult was high. The adult in a large mechanical vehicle killed a child on a scooter. The adult is responsible, not the child. 

In a perfect world we wouldn't blame children when they're killed by adults and we wouldn't expect children to behave perfectly so adults can drive high.",t2_3mvfkhhl,Tsjjgj,0,1648841912.0,0,t1_i30u6fd,i30u6fd,False,Progressive_Citizen,t3_ttgb68,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/ttgb68/woman_charged_with_thc_impairment_in_saskatoon/,Woman charged with THC impairment in Saskatoon girl's death identified,/r/saskatoon/comments/ttgb68/woman_charged_with_thc_impairment_in_saskatoon/i30u6fd/,5,r/saskatoon,0,5

"That was by design. The company was structured in an intentionally confusing way, likely to make it harder for regulators to understand. There is another post about it from a few days ago (by me, even) that explains it in more detail.

The tl;dr, Epic was a ponzi scheme masquerading as an investment company masquerading as a property management company. They got investors to buy properties then lease them back so that Epic could 'manage' in exchange for direct cash payments. 

You've basically got three groups who got screwed:

1. Unsecured investors - Promissory notes and shares in various epic companies. They're all completely wiped out.
2. Fund a Flip - Most of them are completely wiped out. Depending on the specific deals, some might still own completely gutted homes, but I think the typical faf deal didn't include any right to the property itself, so they're wiped out.
3. Hassle Free - These people bought houses for epic to manage. They now have to figure out what to do with them. Also the houses are largely in terrible condition and overvalued.

They screwed basically 100% of the people who were still invested with their company at the end.

"I was listening to a ""Science Vs"" podcast episode the other day and someone who researches conspiracy theories academically/professionally offered an interesting insight: When you're prone to one conspiracy theory, you become prone to them all. Conspiracy theories will often have similar elements but with differing details, and many of them begin rooted in facts but then go off in directions normal people would consider ""insane"".

So someone could be reading about the USA dosing people with LSD without their knowledge or whatever and start to believe their government would do other kinds of things to people without their knowledge; once you understand that, then conspiracy theorists can come in and tell you about all kinds of things that may or may not have actually happened. This opens the door for all kinds of potentially crazy shit to get into your mind.

When you accept one conspiracy theory and start to chat about it with other conspiracy theorists, the details can change and drift over time and eventually *evidence* becomes unimportant and what matters are how well the puzzle pieces fit together, and those puzzle pieces can be literally *anything* and *anyone* can invent them.

This is how many progressive, leftist, hippies found their way into far-right conspiracy theories and end up supporting fascists and neo-Nazis.

In short: It's not so much *what* they think as it is *how* they think.

*How* to think is one of the most critically important skills a person can learn, and our school systems try to teach us logic (through science and math classes) but they don't do it well enough in my opinion.

"One thing that pissed me off royally with how Ness is managed is the fact they no longer provide waste disposal, instead telling their guests to pack in/pack out all their trash and frame it as if they are doing the ""environmental"" thing. Sounds great in theory, in practice it's another story.

In reality it is a cost cutting measure driving profits knowing full well their patrons partying and on drugs are going to end up leaving out trash everywhere rather then storing garbage and food waste in their hot cars (hell half of them are sleeping in their vehicles, they aren't going to store trash in there.),  leading to the inevitable consequence that bears come around and have to be killed year after year because they have become too accustomed to humans.

Real environmental there Ness, Bravo! üëè Glad you saved yourself a few dollars at the expense of a couple bears.

"The Ness thing was a joke, no way is it going Nazi. Though I do know people from Ness, who similar to what you said, ended up taking hardline right positions, not so much being huge anti-vaxxers  but rather became huge Trump supporters.

Even in my own case, I've been to Ness many times and am very left leaning on many issues but also known for being one of the biggest defenders of Moe in this sub, which in the eyes of many of the people in this sub would make them want to try and label me as being ""alt right"" for doing so.

Watching the transformation of those on the left taking up more right leaning stances on issues with time is nothing new though, lends to the popular saying ""If you are not a liberal when you are young, you have no heart, and If you are not a conservative when old, you have no brain"".

There are likely evolutionary factors that play into this general trend with respect to how these ideological shifts protect us while living in a society at different points as we age and with respect to our role in society.",t2_5isr50xr,Rusholme_and_P,0,1648811418.0,0,t1_i2yw3th,i2yw3th,False,Brave-Strategy-7700,t3_ttfm6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/saskatoon/comments/ttfm6l/hippies_and_the_farright_what_the_hell_happened/,Hippies and the far-right.
