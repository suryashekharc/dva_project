Hi i know this isn’t related at all but I live in Hayward and I’m designing a board game. It sounds like you are pretty deep into the hobby. I wondered if you wouldn’t mind talking to me about what you like (and dislike!) the most about board games. Totally ok if you’re not up for it. I know you’re here looking for players. I just figured I’d ask.

"The fear decreased with every sighting. I don't think it was the same one every time either. But every time, it seemed as if they were in the middle of something and noticed that I was there then left in a hurry. Like it/they didn't want to be caught. 

One other time that stands out... I was in the kitchen around 3 or 4 in the morning and as I walked out into the dining room, I walked into one face to face the same way you would bump into someone at a grocery store or something. 

As soon as I stopped, it kind of reeled back then took off. 

Every time, the reaction was like walking in on a kid that was doing something it wasn't supposed to be doing, then they bug out in a hurry. 

The only non-static thing I've seen is a dim glow near the ceiling of my room. I never saw it in Oakland, but I've seen it maybe 4 times in my current house. Every time I had been woken up by what I thought was my phone or some other type of light. When I found the source it was  a very faintly glowing purple/pink cloud near the ceiling. It looked similar to those pictures of glowing gas clouds in space. Not really moving, no real shape or detail. 

I didn't get a sense of anything while it was there. No fear, no panic, no calm. I was neutral to it and just went back to sleep. 

Not too long after seeing the cloud the first time, I was startled by my shower radio. I had a shower radio that turned on with the push of a button. It would come on at random times and I chocked it up to it being old and maybe water got into the switch. Well, again, I woke up early one morning before sunrise and went to the bathroom. All the lights were off, but there was enough light from the porch coming in through the window. Just as I'm finishing up the radio turned on and startled the hell out of me. After my quick jump and scare I laughed and said ""Now turn it off"". The damn thing turned off.

I pulled the batteries out of it, went outside and threw it away before going back to bed.",t2_4o1mhlbw,SqueakyHuevos,0,1646504571.0,0,t1_hzh99fz,hzh99fz,False,almost_a_person,t3_t6tz7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/t6tz7m/do_you_have_a_paranormal_story_to_tell/,Do you have a Paranormal story to tell?,/r/Hayward/comments/t6tz7m/do_you_have_a_paranormal_story_to_tell/hzh99fz/,2,r/Hayward,0,2

"  In late 1990 I moved to a house on 51st Avenue in East Oakland with my parents and little brother. I was 13 at the time. Our previous house in west Oakland was condemned after the 89 earthquake hit. My brother and I were ecstatic to be living in a house that wasn't a duplex, and even more excited to have a huge backyard.

   A few days after settling into the house, my brother and I decided to do some proper exploring. The house was built in 1919 and was filled with built in nooks and crevices. The first place we checked out was the huge fireplace, hoping to find something tucked away in the flue. Or to find a loose brick with a treasure tucked behind. But through all our searching, we never found anything in the house except newspapers from the 50's and 60's on the very top shelf of the pantry cabinet.

   One day we were out in the front yard and noticed multiple holes in the siding and chunks taken out of various trim pieces. I decided to go digging around in one of the holes with my pocket knife and dug out a 9mm bullet. Most of the other holes yielded more fired bullets. After that I started noticing poorly patched bullet holes inside the house as well. 

   My mother got to talking to our nextdoor neighbor Mrs. Monroe and she told us that she had moved next door in 1959 and knew the previous owners of our house. She said that the wife died of cancer in the mid 70s and her husband died in bed not too long after. The house sat abandoned after that for many years. In the 80's it ended up being a crack house and heroine den. She told us ambulances showed up on multiple occasions taking out people who had overdosed and that at least 3 drive-bys were done on the house resulting in dead drug dealers.

   Not too long after hearing those stories I started noticing strange things in the house. Dishes in the drying rack would clink and rattle at night, random flashes of dim light, I would wake up to whatbsounded like cabinet doors being closed forcefully, cold spots in varoius places, thumps and creaks that my dad said were because ""this is an oooold house, they settle and creak because of all the wood"". My Doberman, Max would also suddenly stand and stare down the hallway at seemingly nothing.

  One day I came home from school early and only me and the dog were home. That was the day I realized something wasn't right in that house. As I approached the house, I could hear Max barking inside. Max hardly EVER barked. I figured maybe there was a mouse inside and he was chasing it. When I opened the front door, Max ran up to me, shoved at me with his nose a few times and just stared down the hall. I blew it off, patted him on the head and went to the bathroom. Halfway through doing my business, Max busted into the bathroom and stuffed himself behind the toilet shaking like a leaf. This kind of scared me because I'd never known that dog to be afraid of ANYTHING! I cautiously checked around the house looking for anything out of the ordinary but everything looked fine. All the windows & doors were locked and no one else was inside. But Max didn't come out of that bathroom for a few hours. When he finally did, he ran straight outside to the backyard.


    Fast forward to July of 1991. My parents and brother had gone to Fairfield for the day. I didn't want to go, so I stayed home. It was about 5 or 6 in the evening and I was laying in bed watching TV. My bedroom door and 1 of the  windows were open for a breeze. I had just shut the TV off to try and take a nap when, what appeared to be something shaped like a person flashed into my room. I say shaped like a person because it appeared to be what I could only describe as static in a roughly human form. Imagine Groot, drawn with just heavy black pencil lines and no type of detail other than a crude shape. The lines it was made of danced around and moved randomly in all directions, expanding and contracting like static. But the entire mass moved intelligently... Like a  person being chased would.

   It darted into my room, stopped right in the middle and looked around as if searching for something. Then suddenly it looked straight at me. It stared for what seemed like forever. As quickly as it ran in, it flew past me and out of the window disappearing into thin air. This whole encounter was less than 5 seconds long and for the entire time I was paralyzed with fear. I tried to yell, but the sound was caught in my throat, my body refused to move. I was fixated in a state of terror. 

   This happened several more times throughout the years and in different parts of the house until just after my 17th birthday. It was then I joined the Navy and left that house for good.",t2_4o1mhlbw,SqueakyHuevos,0,1646460194.0,0,t1_hzf624n,hzf624n,False,almost_a_person,t3_t6tz7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/t6tz7m/do_you_have_a_paranormal_story_to_tell/,Do you have a Paranormal story to tell?,/r/Hayward/comments/t6tz7m/do_you_have_a_paranormal_story_to_tell/hzf624n/,7,r/Hayward,0,7

My only gripe with south Hayward is that it’s filled with so many auto body shops, car dealerships, and tire shops.

"Moved here from LA a couple of years ago. Still adapting to how quiet it is, but during pandemic can’t really fully blame the city for it. 
I’ll echo what others have said about finding anything within a 30 min drive. 
My favorites are the shoreline, overall flat for runs and quiet enough to allow distancing. Some nice wildlife sightings as well. Chabot lake and quarry lakes at castro valley and union city are quite nice as well. 
Alameda is a gem overall and very close to drive to.  Star on park is a great pizza place, there’s an awesome pokebar at that same street. 
Downtown B street has a couple of nice bars that are worthy checking out and Castro Valley’s market place is a fun upscale food markwt experience with indoor and outdoor tables to dine at. 
The closest to an LA food experience I found ao far was Lido’s Backyard in Oakland, reminds me a lot of LA’s restaurants with a lot of outdoor dining, music, etc.

When I moved in I really enjoyed the library downtown, farmers market, the Japanese gardens, etc...

"I’ve been a resident of Hayward since 2015. We got a busy dog park at sunsets (Eden Greenway Dog Park). Check out the library downtown! 

Every town has its bad parts but it’s nothing compared to the recent crimes of shootings/carjackings of Oakland. Just keep an eye out on your car late at night - wheel thieves! And the occasional package thieves during daylight. Relatively quiet town besides the commute times - a lot of commuters have to pass through Hayward. 

Best part of it - you’re basically in the center of the Bay Area. Berkeley is north, the Peninsula is just a bridge (92) away, Castro Valley/Livermore/Pleasanton towards the east, and San Jose down south.

"Lived here nearly all my life. Moved out a few years ago. 
Good eats: Val’s - off B St (Solid 50s diner where the jocks used to pick on the nerds), Carmen’s Family BBQ - off West A St (Jamaican influence and now my mouth is watering). Pakwan - off Mission, very solid Indian/ Pakistani food, dine-in for all you can Chai. Of course, I move out and then they open a Filipino Grocery store (it’s near the mall by Olive Garden) that serves food cafeteria style and also has a Jollibee (for your fried chicken and sweet spaghetti w/ hotdog needs. Seriously, try it) I attest that the best restaurants in Hayward are Mexican; my favorite is Los Pericos, also by the mall, near Panda Express. 
Not a whole lot of sights in Hayward, go bike the shoreline, hike the hills; Garin park is surprisingly nice. Bring your kids to Kennedy park. Hate to say, downtown took a step back by taking out the old library. They shoulda made the mall look like how the library looks now.

"As others have said, Japanese garden is a not so hidden gem, love that Koi Pond d:^].

The shoreline is nice. As is the Memorial Park Trail. I remember years ago it had a waterfall* when it used to rain in California. (*Trickle of water down a mountainside)

Downtown, aka B st, is honestly up and coming. Random new businesses opening up, going for that pedestrian friendly townie vibe. Record stores, bars, bookstore, ESCAPE ROOM, formerly an arcade, a distillery, local brewery, occasional street fair and farmers market. 

Also, haven't personally visited, but the new open air park where the old library used to be. It reminds me of like a Zocalo from Mexico. I probably just haven't been because I can't emotionally get over the old library being gone.

Not massively far from Hayward's border (Maybe San Lorenzo???) Is Golfland in Castro Valley. Not too many mini golf places around here so that's notable at least.

Also San Felipe park is pretty cool. Nice view of Castro valley and if the day is particularly clear, you can see the City. Sulphur Creek is also not even 5 mins away. In the same vein the Reptile Room on A st has plenty of interesting Reptiles on display and for sale.

Hayward used to be a cheap option for young first time home buyers that wanted to start their families. With today's real estate market it is no longer an option. So families are pushed further out into the outer bay area and the number of kids enrolled every year is dropping.

Ya its crazy! They aren't doing anything to stop the spread now their plan to vaxx our kids won't stop the spread they have no real ppe in place. Masking and hand sanitizer. Now they want to add two more schools to each school which is the receiving schools supposedly are newer campuses (that's bs) just as the board is bs they don't listen to parents concerns they had clinics scheduled and provided the info in the meeting before they even took a vote on it. They put a mandate in place before the gov of California did and his is only if the approvals from the fda go thru.

"Hello,

My 2 door black 1994 honda prelude SI was stolen from outside my house in berkeley about a month ago and I have been looking for it ever since. I've reported this to the police but haven't got any luck. I recently got an update from fastrak saying that it was used on the i880 freeway near hayward. More specifically, on the tennyson zone SB and hesperian blvd NB. The license plate is black and yellow NKRY. There is some damage to the left fender and a scratch on the right side door. The car has lots of meaning to me as it was given to me by my 90 year old neighbor. Please let me know if you may have seen it or heard anything about it.

"Starting in 2019, a group of three of us started to host a ""tavern event"" at our residence in Hayward, CA. We offered appetizers, a meal, drinks, ale, and games (ALL homemade). All of the features of the tavern from the meal to the games have a flourish of medieval or Renaissance-Faire flair to them. Think of taverns referenced in various literature: The Prancing Pony (LotR), The Green Dragon Inn (LotR), Crossroads Inn (ASOIAF), The Eolian (KKC), Inn of the Last Home (DLC), Goldshire Inn (WoW), Hogs Head Inn (HP), The Winespring Inn (WoT) - these are the taverns that we draw our inspiration from. Our goal is to bring a community together to meet people and have fun in this unique setting.

Furthermore, our events were free to all those who reserved a seat - no strings attached.

If you're interesting in attending, check out our eventbrite page to reserve your seat(s). You can also check out our webpage or facebook page to learn more!

"Hey, I’m from Lancaster! Can confirm that the title is accurate and that has happened, but the mayor of Lancaster is a massive fuckhead who did this in part to increase the economic divide in Lancaster. Lancaster is a historically redlined community, and there are massive economic and racial divides between the West and East sides still today. While the development has been great for the West side, which is historically where people of color were barred from buying homes, the East side is still languishing and has lost several important businesses. I grew up on the East side. Every time I go back, more businesses have shuttered, and there are more and more visible houseless people—which is a huge problem, because it regularly drops below freezing in Lancaster during the winter and summer temperatures often rise above 100° during the summer. 

Not saying that this isn’t a good thing, or that more cities shouldn’t do it. I’m just trying to make sure Parris’ (the mayor’s) actions don’t go uncondemned. This particular action had severe consequences for the rest of the city, and given Parris’ track record, I highly doubt he would have approved of this development if it didn’t screw over the city’s Black and Brown residents.",t2_9zvhfgmb,lesbiantolstoy,0,1622775711.0,0,t1_h0it26t,h0it26t,True,S0_uthern,t3_nrm20v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/nrm20v/i_wish_hayward_would_achieve_something_like_this/,I wish Hayward would achieve something like this,/r/Hayward/comments/nrm20v/i_wish_hayward_would_achieve_something_like_this/h0it26t/,8,r/Hayward,0,8

"On the surface not much to do here but we have some of the best hiking trails in the bay and or are a stone's throw from just about anyplace in the bay area you might want to go. Downtown has movie theater and restaurants. As far as living here advice. Avoid the downtown Lucky's grocery store, the down town bar known as the funky monkey and the downtown area at night is best avoided with anything smaller than a group of three. Chavez market has a great mission style burrito and the produce is always super great but El rancho supermarket on redwood road might have the better burrito. There are several really good pupuserias and the one down town is closest to eating pupusas in El Salvador that I have found. Acqua e Farina is my preferred Italian spot in Hayward and also located downtown.
Edit : sushi land on mission is my preferred sushi restaurant and there is no good pizza anyplace in California if you are coming from the east coast.

"I don't know what your expectations are, exactly, but I think Hayward is nice mainly because of its central position in the Bay Area. If you're not from the Bay Area, perhaps you'd be interested in visiting other nearby locations outside of Hayward. Hayward is very suburban. Nearby cities with more to see and do: Oakland, Berkeley, SF, San Jose.

That said, here are some thoughts about Hayward specifically. Downtown Hayward has been improving. Buffalo Bills is a popular brewery/eatery, but there are other options nearby. Bronco Billys is an old pizza parlor near CSUEB that's pretty popular too. Garin Regional park (see the Dry Creek trail) has a nice 2 mile hike loop if you like nature. Knowing where BART stations are located would be helpful. Tacos Uropan is pretty good in my opinion. Hayward has a nice, small Japanese garden as well. If you like history, you might find [Ukraina Honcharenko](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/ukraina-honcharenko-at-garin-regional-park) in the hills by CSUEB interesting.

"Very good! Also make sure your doc notes in your medical records that your asthma has worsened due to this issue and get a copy of that, plus whatever he writes to the HOA manager for your records.

"A bit more practical advice: 

* Don't use any more spray foam insulation; it's a nightmare to remove if you need to make any home repairs later. 
* You're going to need more than one air purifier until this mess gets straightened out, so at least buy one more for your bedroom and one for the room that you spend the most time in... or if you're tight on funds, you can move the one you have from room to room as needed. Make sure your air purifier is the correct size for the largest room you plan to use it in and also make sure it has a [True HEPA filter](https://breathequality.com/hepa-filter/#:~:text=True%20HEPA%20filter%2C%20with%20HEPA%20stands%20for%20High,applications%2C%20like%20vacuum%20cleaners%2C%20automobiles%20and%20even%20aircraft.) and not a ""HEPA-like"" filter inside.
* Avoid purifiers that have [ionizers](https://homeairguides.com/are-ionizers-bad-for-asthma/) as they can make asthma symptoms worse. 
* Don't engage with those neighbors any longer; this is now the homeowner's association's problem to sort out. If they try to talk to you, ignore them; if they begin to harass you, record them, call the cops if necessary, and do not engage. Add every interaction to your paper-trail and get a restraining order if needed.
* Charcoal absorbs odors. Buy a big bag of charcoal briquets (nothing fancy, any cheap brand will do, but just get the plain kind, without ""flavorings"" or additives) and place some in a disposable bowl or dish near where the smoke smells are most prevalent. 
* If you have other neighbors who are also being affected, encourage them to write to the Homeowners Association as well and get copies of their letters/emails for your records. This will really help your case because the more people who are on record as being negatively affected by those jerks, the more compelled the Homeowners Association will be to act.

Hopefully the situation will resolve quickly and peacefully.",t2_3onegn99,StillSwaying,0,1620364867.0,0,t1_gx8pj7i,gx8pj7i,True,DearestZeus,t3_n6oo52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/n6oo52/condo_owner_in_hayward_stuck_with_downstairs/,Condo Owner in Hayward Stuck with Downstairs Smokers,/r/Hayward/comments/n6oo52/condo_owner_in_hayward_stuck_with_downstairs/gx8pj7i/,8,r/Hayward,0,8

"What a nightmare! As a fellow asthma-sufferer, you have my deepest condolences. 

Look, friend, nothing is going to make these people stop except hitting them where it hurts: in the wallet. You have to start building a paper-trail right now of everything you've done so far to mitigate this issue. Include every expense you've made from the air purifiers to the extra toll this has taken on your health (medical bills) to the gas used to drive to the hospital. 

Buy one of those indoor air quality monitors and record yourself using it when you notice the air is particularly bad. Itemize everything, including any time taken off work because you've been too sick with asthma, and send that list and your formal complaint via certified mail to the homeowners association. Let them know that if those people downstairs continue to smoke and not comply with the rules, you are prepared to take legal action. This is *their* job to fix. That's why you all pay dues. 

Eventually (hopefully), they'll start fining those jerks for every breach of contract and once the fines start to add up, they'll either (hopefully again) stop smoking or risk losing possession of the condo from all of the fines they've accrued.

Most lawyers offer a free consultation for the first visit, so get your docs in order and consult one. It's always a good idea to see what your legal options are in a case like this.

"Recs are from Hayward/Union City/Fremont/Castro Valley and sorry if anything is out dated- covid had me out of the loop for a while. Also apologizing for poor formatting and spelling errors. 

Chaplins is a good local sports bar. 

BK bistro in Fremont is my favorite dim sum spot. 

Red Chili or Chai Thai for Thai food.  

Dragon House is good but I heard recently the food got a little sub par for it’s reputation. New China is a friend favorite. 

Asia Express is cheap and fast food Chinese, but decent. 

Chef Experience China Bistro is expensive but good.

Break Your Fast - breakfast local owned 

Bills Cafe - breakfast (Bay Area chain? Started in SJ?)

Country Way - highly recommend the French toast. 

Buffalo Bills (brewery/pizza) in downtown Hayward is nice good beer, good pizzas and appetizers. 

Manekis in union city is good for sushi 

Ramen Shu for Ramen (my favorite, but some friends prefer Tadamasa)

Wednesday nights during the summer Niles had food trucks (pre-covid). 

Sia Fusion lounge - Korean fusion that’s open late 

Sister House - great Korean food imo

Knudsens Ice Creamery - recommend the apple pie à la mode almond ice cream and with caramel. 

Hippies Brew- coffee shop 

The taco truck in Niles is good (Tacos Negris) and has a sacred heart Jesus painted on the side. 

Toppings Too or Gerrys Grill for Filipino food

Ghazni Afghan Kabobs - Good Afghan food 

My Favorite Indian Restaurant - off mission, good buffet, friendly staff. The one in union city is good too. 

Southland mall isn’t the nicest so a lot of people in the east bay travel to stoneridge in Pleasanton for shopping, but I would assume you would rather travel back to the peninsula for that. Automall (multi plaza shopping area) is popular for food and light shopping. New Park mall is like a less nice Hillsdale Mall to me. 
Bobs Discount liquor stores are convenient cheap alcohol 
Half Price Books in Fremont is cool for books and movies. 
Escutias is honest and affordable auto repair, money back if he can’t fix it. 

Bronco Billy’s (pizza) has multiple locations but the one on smith street has the best pizza, but the one in Niles is fun to hang out at. (The second story of the smith street bronco Billy’s is said to be haunted).
The white witch in Niles canyon is kinda a white woman type ghost tale, secret sidewalk is a popular spot for people to adventure to, but it’s not officially open for the public. 

Tennyson can be rough between Hesperian and mission. Up B street in down town also. Decoto in union city is slightly known for being bad. Pockets of neighborhoods near the Sonic off mission can be quiet and nice or a bit rougher too. 

Japanese Gardens in downtown Hayward is a hidden gem I think. There’s also a sidewalk in downtown that I’ve heard is seismologists make a big deal about, but iirc might have been re-paved? 
People hike Garin and it can have pretty views.

"> It sounds like these reforms are a first step as it is a “pilot program” so yes small first step

And that right there is a problem. People are literally dying- at the hands of Hayward Police no less- and the department is slow walking these small steps through. I'd have far more faith in the department if they were the ones pushing reforms and fixes, instead of them constantly arguing and trying to stop any reforms only to replace them with minor things like this. If the department is unable and unwilling to think big and tackle what has literally been a decades long problem then relying on them to make changes themselves doesn't make any sense.

At the end of the day it amounts to this- Hayward Police, like many police departments in this country, has lost the trust of the community it serves. The department needs to rebuild that trust if they want to be the driving force behind reform, but unfortunately the department seems more concerns about preventing reforms and holding onto power than it does about solving the problems that caused the lack of trust to begin with.

Also, just to be super clear about this, I'm not a member of the Hayward Coalition- although I do agree with pretty much everything they say and do. I just passed their message along in case anyone else was interested in joining their group, which I think it doing amazing work forcing the department to actually pick up reforms instead of sticking with the status quo as they've been doing for years now.",t2_346wh,tedivm,0,1618583581.0,0,t1_guq8cqb,guq8cqb,False,tedivm,t3_mr0k6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/,If you’re interested in joining a group of Hayward community members organizing to defund the police & build people power sign up to join the Hayward Community Coalition!,/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/guq8cqb/,2,r/Hayward,0,2
"These reforms you mention are an extremely low bar. If the departments really cared there's a lot more they could be doing, but they haven't. It's not worth waiting another decade just to hear the same excuses over and over again, especially when there's so much low hanging fruit that could result in positive change.

There's no reason, none, that police should be showing up for a mental health crisis call. Sending dedicated trained professionals, who are not armed, would save lives and free police up to do what they are hired for. There's no reason police should be acting as security guards for public transit when there are other cheaper programs that have been proven to work better. When it's been proven over and over again that using unarmed traffic enforcement agents reducing the risk of traffic stops for both the driver being stopped and the officer it makes no sense to continue putting both drivers and officers at needless risk. 

These aren't even extreme reforms, but the fact that police and their supporters freak out whenever you mention even these small changes show that there is a real cultural problem with our police departments.",t2_346wh,tedivm,0,1618543493.0,0,t1_guonudv,guonudv,False,tedivm,t3_mr0k6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/,If you’re interested in joining a group of Hayward community members organizing to defund the police & build people power sign up to join the Hayward Community Coalition!,/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/guonudv/,3,r/Hayward,0,3

"The entire defund the police movement is about exactly these types of changes. The reality is that police budgets are way out of proportion to other departments and services, to a degree that is detrimental even to law enforcement itself (such as the drug case above, where police are being asked to solve symptoms of problems when we should be addressing the root causes). Reducing the amount spent on police so the money can be spent in other areas would be a huge help.

I've got another set of examples-

BART recently started their ambassador program. These are unarmed individuals who hang out in stations and on trains. Simply having them there reduces crime and vandalism, and people are more willing to come up and ask them for help. The amount of police contacts on BART dropped (even before covid), and people actually felt safer. In the cases where the ambassadors felt unsafe they were able to contact the police to deal with the issues, saving those resources for when they're truly needed.

Another example is this most recent shooting that has been all over the news. That shooting started with a pretextual stop- the car had old registration stickers. Now if there was a dedicated traffic enforcement department they would have known that the state had a backlog of stickers to send out (meaning expired stickers were not probable cause) and had actually put a break on pulling people over for that. Further, if the enforcement officers were unarmed the sitaution wouldn't have escalated. As a third point, the only reason it escalated was because there was a bench warrant out for the victim (because the courts mailed a notice of a hearing to the wrong address). The entire concept of bench warrants is extremely problematic, and having police enforce them causes no end of issue. In most cases you'd be far, far better off sending a social worker to check in rather than a law enforcement officer, and then when things like ""we had the wrong address"" occur the issue can be resolved without needing a gun.",t2_346wh,tedivm,0,1618523631.0,0,t1_gunlltf,gunlltf,False,tedivm,t3_mr0k6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/,If you’re interested in joining a group of Hayward community members organizing to defund the police & build people power sign up to join the Hayward Community Coalition!,/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/gunlltf/,3,r/Hayward,0,3

"Police departments don't have carte blanche on their budgets. Although it does very city by city and state by state, most police departments have requirements, earmarks, and restrictions on how money can be spent.

An example of this can be seen right here in Hayward. In 2020 Hayward reduced the police budget by $2.9 million simply by removing 12 police officer positions that weren't currently filled. No one was fired, but they lowered the cap on the number of police officers to match the existing numbers of the departments.

"First I'd separate out the drug and theft into two separate problems. Police don't solve drug problems, they enforce laws that deal with the symptoms of the drug problems. The solution to the actual problems tends to involve things like treatment, housing, and other things police do not provide.

As for theft- honestly police have been pretty useless in dealing with it, and I don't believe more police will help. Unarmed security guards are far more effective (per dollar) as a deterant- you can have more of them patrolling an area for the same price.

As I mentioned in my other comment as well the idea isn't to take the money away and provide nothing. Reducing the staff of the police departments allows you to move the money to other departments. Reducing the amount of money spent on military surplus weapons and gear and shifting it to training is another reform method that would reduce violence. Replacing some officers with healthcare workers for a proper crisis intervention team would not only provide better services for those having a mental health crisis, but would also reduce the risk considerably and is a great example of how defunding police to refund communities with better services would work.",t2_346wh,tedivm,0,1618509287.0,0,t1_gumov6j,gumov6j,False,tedivm,t3_mr0k6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/,If you’re interested in joining a group of Hayward community members organizing to defund the police & build people power sign up to join the Hayward Community Coalition!,/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/gumov6j/,5,r/Hayward,0,5

"The reality is that deescalation training hasn't worked. One thing that does work is replacing police with other types of workers (specifically the unarmed kind) in more situations. If you defund the police you don't just throw that money away- you use it to provide the services in a different way.

One good example is traffic enforcement. Many cities have replaced their armed police with unarmed traffic enforcement agents, and some (such as Berkeley) are looking at having that group of people work under their department of transportation rather than the police department. This simple change would have saved the lives of many people.

Police departments get an obscene portion of the budget for most cities. In part that's because police are often used for things where there are no other staff available. This means you have an armed force doing jobs that don't require violence, which in turn continues to introduce violence to areas where it shouldn't exist. Defunding police and refunding communities would be better for everyone.",t2_346wh,tedivm,0,1618451472.0,0,t1_guk4smp,guk4smp,False,tedivm,t3_mr0k6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/,If you’re interested in joining a group of Hayward community members organizing to defund the police & build people power sign up to join the Hayward Community Coalition!,/r/Hayward/comments/mr0k6z/if_youre_interested_in_joining_a_group_of_hayward/guk4smp/,8,r/Hayward,0,8

"Hayward is medium size suburb in the East Bay, so most of the fun/functions/parties/etc  will be in Oakland/Berkeley or you'd have to go to SF/San Jose. Most of Hayward is decent/nice too. I'd say anything along Mission is nice and close to CSUEB + fair price. Downtown is pretty chill and will have some events on the weekends.

South Hayward has some mehhhh parts, but I wouldn't call it a ""hood"". Hayward/South Hayward BART will be your best-friend. You'll be able to take a train to almost anywhere in the Bay (aside from SJ).

Lastly Hayward is the best location in the Bay in terms of distant to other cities. You're not too far from any city (SF,SJ, Berkeley, Pleasanton, Walnut Creek, or Oakland). Nothing will take more than an 1 hour to get to.

Fun thing to do in Hayward:  
\-Japanese Garden

\-Chabot Lake Hiking/Fishing/Picnic areas  
\-Southland Mall (Bowling Alley + Movie theaters + arcades there)  
\-Chalk it Up (Best gaming lounge in Downtown Hayward)  
\-TPC Stonebrae Country Club (Top of Hayward Hills and has really nice views)

Aside from that you're 100% going to have to checkout Oakland/Berkeley/SJ/SF.

I live near campus and drive to use the Mission Hills golf practice area multiple times a week. If I was a student, I’d live as close to campus as possible. If that’s not available, I suggest generally staying east of CA-238 between Mission and the Hayward hills. The areas north of campus and east of Mission are great.

- why does the kid need to try both back doors only?

There's also the Adobe Art Center in Castro Valley. It's part of Hayward rec. They're closed because of Covid right now, but maybe check them later?

Lastly, I would suggest contacting Sun Gallery http://www.sungallery.org/ I am pretty sure they have a kiln, too. But right now, everything is being affected by Covid.

I'm sure there's other possibilities, but I can't recall them at the moment.

I've been there it's really expensive. I would definitely try to @ them on twitter/there IG as they post everything on IG. good luck to you. If they were honest about it taking sessions I think it would have helped you make a decision of getting the service or not. I know I paid $388 first visit second visit was like $325.

"Ugh so sorry. I wouldn't pay for it until it's corrected.
 Similar thing happened to me. I wanted partial balayage. I have medium brown hair and wanted the highlight a soft golden brown- lighter. I chose the highlight against my natural color and it looked nice. 
3 hours later, my hair was entirely copper colored- no highlights. It was terrible. The manager told me it would 'fade'. I said no, she left it on too long, and she then said she could use a rinse to get the color off.
A total of 6 hours in the salon and over $350 with a discount I had to argue because they fucked up my hair, I left the salon pissed with a full head of copper hair still.",t2_1qf5so8d,grilledcheeseonrye,0,1605153842.0,0,t1_gc09nmu,gc09nmu,True,[deleted],t3_jsmjd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hayward/comments/jsmjd2/thoughts/,Thoughts?,/r/Hayward/comments/jsmjd2/thoughts/gc09nmu/,10,r/Hayward,0,10
