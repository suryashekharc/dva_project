"It's almost definitely the best place to be trans within maybe a 65 mile radius, but...that's not necessarily saying a lot. 

I know there are a number of trans people at the university and working for local businesses. Skyward, one of the bigger local employers, is owned by right-wing nutcases.... oddly enough, they employ a lot of queen people and several gender fluid people. One of their VPs was openly in a gay relationship for years (he's retired now). 

There is a very loud group of Q-adjacent rightwingers who can cause trouble. There have been some kids who started or almost started altercations at Pride or BLM events.

"There is not a single factual statement in that entire paragraph. 

Staffing shortages are due to the number of teachers and staff out with Covid and the lack of subs to fill those positions. When you don’t have enough staff available to teach/supervise students what other option is there but to move to e-learning?

We just came off a holiday break where students and staff spent time with family, and likely many of those students and staff returned to school WITH Covid.

You know how you prevent that from happening again? Send your child(ren) to school with medical or N95 masks, and get them vaccinated so they’re less likely to get Covid or are at least symptomatic for a shorter period of time.

And yes, many students and staff are protected, from getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19, as that’s what the vaccines are proving to do. That does not mean one can’t get or transmit COVID-19.  Are you truly, after all this time, confused about viral spread?

And children are not at any significant risk? What about their family members, their parents or grandparents who they might give COVID-19 to? They don’t matter? Have you seen the recent COVID-19 youth cases? https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/covid-19/cases.htm#youth

"Ah, so you DON’T know what CRT is then. I mean, it’s been pretty clear all along that you don’t, but I wanted you to be able to at least prove me wrong.

CRT, or Critical Race Theory, is a way of looking at laws to see if they might disproportionately affect people of color. A prime example would be zoning laws. Since the early 20th century, zoning has continued to be a tool used to separate the poor, who are disproportionately people of color from certain neighborhoods. This can be done, for example, by allowing only single-family homes or homes on large lots, both of which will exclude more affordable housing.

Now remind me which grade it is kids talk about zoning laws? Oh, that’s right, they don’t. Because CRT is taught at a collegiate level to law students. It isn’t taught at the K-12 level.

"But just for “fun” u/tape_measures, let’s look deeper into how it is you consider me a lunatic.

It’s no secret the Freedom Fighters are anti-mask, anti-vaccine, anti-EDI (equity, diversity, and inclusion), and likely anti-CRT (which, let’s face it, is a white supremacist dog whistle, but I digress…)

It’s been established that masks do, in fact, lessen the chances persons infected with Covid-19 will spread the virus to others. It’s really no longer up for debate no matter how much the FF claim it is.

Now let’s look at the efficacy of the Covid vaccines from a purely statistical standpoint. Epidemiologists break down data in terms of per 10,000 people. So right now in the US, per 10,000 people, about 530 have Covid right now. Of that roughly 530, 370 are unvaccinated, ~120 are vaccinated, 42 have received their booster shot. It’s quite evident the vaccines are working.

The benefits of EDI in schools are numerous, more thoughtful empathetic children, children better prepared to enter the workforce, improved communication and thought processing skills…

So all of these things are well studied, well documented, and yet you have a group steadfast in their beliefs that the experts are wrong, that you know more because of your “research”. And then you’ve got this entire group of candidates, backed by a group whose opinions are based on little of fact or evidence, and you claim I’m a lunatic.

By definition a lunatic is one who behaves foolishly. So your claim is following evidence based study is foolish? Uhh….

"There's a possibility that some Freedom Fighter / Liberty Leaders candidates may win a number of the seats up for election in County Board, in City Council, and on the School Board.  


There is, however, a very low probability of these candidates being able to actually \*govern\* in the seats that they win.   


Why would I say such a thing? Well, the problem is that Stevens Point/Portage County/North-Central Wisconsin/Wisconsin as a whole are entering into the time that Rich Heinberg calls the ""End of Growth"" period, or that one of the Limits to Growth authors, Ugo Bardi over there in Italy, calls ""going off the Seneca Cliff.""   


Ideology and cool phrases about ""freedom"" or ""liberty"" do not amount to the capacity to govern, in a time when the growth paradigm itself is ""dead, or dying"" as the oil industry consultants Labyrinth put it.   


Everyone has probably noticed by now that the workforce itself is in chaos. In our area, something like 1,200 people are going to retire out of manufacturing jobs by 2030 (according to Mid-States Technical College).  


Nobody is coming in to replace those folks who will be retiring.

"We attended that last appearance of Rev. King up at that north side bar. The lady I was hanging out with was chatting it up quite a while with Keeter Ked and a few others at a table, while her husband was watching with some amusement. The Constitution gets mentioned a lot at these meetings I'm thinking, but don't forget that clause that says there shall not be an ""establishment of religion"" in government.   


I get the feeling that the ""brand"" or version of Christianity which this group is promulgating intends to become the predominant form of Christianity, making the other Protestant and/or Catholic groups subservient politically. That would be an ""establishment of religion.""  


Also note that the Constitution has been altered hundreds of times, and not just by the 27 amendments so far. Each time the Supreme Court hands down a decision, that is in effect an amendment. Case in point would be the Citizens United decision which declares that ""Corporations are people; corporate campaign donations are free speech."" Nowhere in the Original little pamphlet version of the Constitution that you see handed out at rallies, does that clause appear.   


There's even a movement now to make a 28th Amendment--started up by Ben Manski et al. in the Green Party. The Move to Amend declares that Corporations are NOT people, only natural persons are people, and corporate money (whether from private corporations OR labor unions) must be banned from political campaigns altogether. Even the ""dark money"" like the independent expenditure committees use (undisclosed donors, usually the rich and the super-rich who own these corporations).   


So, maybe my friend & I might make it over to the Sunday gathering this week.

"Imagine if we all started making decisions based on what the evidence shows us and not emotion. 

It’s so interesting that you and your crew keep using “leftist” as if it’s some insult. 

Leftists tend to look at a problem and say well, what do studies and evidence show us? They show us that if we do ______ the odds are high the outcome will be ______. 

Crazy concept to follow study and evidence, I know.

Then there are groups like yours. We don’t care what the evidence shows, I *feel* this is wrong! You don’t have to have a degree to know things! 

I don’t know how to bring together two groups, one of which seems to actively choose to ignore evidence simply because you feel a certain way. 

It’s an odd way to choose to go about life. I can’t imagine in your line of work you ignore all previous outcomes and act based on emotion. Or maybe you do.

I think we all want the same thing, to protect our children. We all, teachers, parents, and students alike, want in person learning. But keeping schools open means keeping them staffed.

"Aren’t you using the same sort of rhetoric? You’re saying because the Common Council doesn’t agree with YOU they should be voted out. And who says the Common Council isn’t listening?

That’s become a real issue in Stevens Point, you have these factions of particularly loud, disruptive individuals who think their voices carry more weight than the voices of everyone else.

I won't even attempt to discuss the issue at hand with you; just plead that you learn to exercise some caution and respect. If you are trying to help the common council by bashing those that disagree with them you will only bring more negative notoriety to the current members.

The thoughts and feelings of a community are not a rally cry, nor are they disruption. If local government members are unwilling to hear what the people of the community have to say they will need to be replaced with a competent council member.

"What’s the threat to business? Business owners argue their businesses will suffer with this change. How? How exactly will their businesses suffer? These are all local destination businesses. These aren’t businesses that someone sees coming off the highway and impulsively thinks to stop at. And if the argument is that this change will create less traffic on Church/Division, that absolutely is speculation. It could just as easily increase traffic.

If the business owners aren’t scared then what are they? They’re certainly not informed. They continue to beat their chests and disrupt meetings armed with false information, information that’s been publicly available for quite some time now. They had every opportunity for input and simply didn’t pay attention. Now, when the people we’ve elected to represent the community are making decisions based on economic impact, cost, safety (the 4-laners don’t seem to much care about that one), and well studied design suddenly the cry is, “they don’t listen to us!” Where were you during the planning meetings?

And who is it the council should listen to? The loud but misinformed used car salesmen types or the softer spoken informed citizens who want a safer thoroughfare through Stevens Point?

This whole Keep Church Street 4-lanes rallying cry reeks of Freedom Fighter/Liberty Leader/let’s disrupt local government offices. 

What about making that stretch of road 4 lanes, with a huge price tag, and the added risk of injury now that people will treat it as a super highway (you ever drive down Post Rd. in Plover? 40 mph is the minimum speed people travel. You drive 35 mph on Post Rd. and you’re getting passed by almost everyone) is taking steps toward a better future?",t2_4ksh12br,FiftyCandles,0,1640176696.0,0,t1_hpjt53m,hpjt53m,False,Maklarr4000,t3_rlha4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevensPoint/comments/rlha4o/stevens_point_council_votes_against_business_51/,Stevens Point council votes against Business 51 referendum resolution,/r/StevensPoint/comments/rlha4o/stevens_point_council_votes_against_business_51/hpjt53m/,4,r/StevensPoint,0,4
"Why exactly should people be embarrassed for getting involved when an issue threatens their business? 

You are incorrect when you say, ""their fears are based on speculation"".  The business owners of Stevens point aren't scared.  The hard working people of this city are concerned that the ideas of a few out of touch individuals may harm our city.  There is a big difference between being scared and taking steps toward a better future.

"> “This is ridiculous. I’m embarrassed. And we sat here back in October and we listened to all these people and how they were so upset and what did you do? You approved it anyway,” Slowinski said.

You should be embarrassed. Meeting after meeting after meeting was held. The public was asked from input, and no one spoke up. Only *after* the Council then decided to move forward with the AECOM proposal for 2 driving lanes and a center turn lane did the south side businesses owners suddenly become concerned.

> Hardees Owner Jack Leichtfuss said… the Business 51 proposal would eliminate his drive-thru exit. 

You don’t have a drive-thru exit, you have an entrance, and you drive through the old Copps parking lot to exit. What you’ll get is a shared entrance, much like the businesses on Business 10. You can tell none of these people have actually listened to the proposal specifics.

This has a lot to do with portage county real estate. Don't rent from them. Dealing with Erin? She'll make you know she got her job because of her dad's death and your issue is not being given your job by your family. Then she will evict you. Cause stress. Make you lose everything as she lies to the regret preterm and that's all extra. I lived over this guy for a year and heard him screaming at all the girls he got she women lovev this guy to the point my new next door neighbor caught his wife cheating on him with Justin. She tried to make amends the other day but Justin was not having that. And of course. Landlord is evicting you for no reason. Stevens point is now only renting to college students so who's off course. Let's fuck up the guy without money. If your in distress. Ask yourself who caused it and who is trying to fuck over people for money. Erin from portage county property management is the cause.

"That is a good way to look at it. Since this was posted I saw/heard Mayor Wiza state that the ""real"" planning would be going ahead at the next meeting if there were any major objections to the current plan. From what I've seen I don't quite understand parts of it, but I'm willing to wait and see what changes when the more affected parties get a chance to hash it out.

I purposefully avoid the roundabout by Sentry as I've only narrowly avoided collisions with people there too many times, usually by folks coming off the interstate while I'm going left onto North Point toward SPASH. They just go like it's a straight piece of road, though I suppose that's more on the bad drivers than the inherent design of the roundabout.

"There's still plenty of room to negotiate as well from what I understand.  But the idea that we can just keep things as they are isn't really feasible financially (all the infrastructure under the street also needs redone as well, not just the surface itself) and also, now that certain hazards have been identified by the traffic studies the city has to rectify them or it opens itself to legal action--which makes sense, I'd be suing if a town ignored a known hazard and I got hurt.   But basically, between the funding issues and the legal imperative to remedy known hazards some things gotta change.   

Of course, you can't please everyone all the time, but a lot of the hubbub seems to be based on emotion instead of actually understanding the nitty gritty.  And I get it. I was extremely skeptical about the roundabout by Sentry but it seems like it's been working out great.

"I've heard a number of proposals, ranging from the more sensible to the ridiculous. I will say that this sounds more reasonable than the plan as I understood it from the meeting notes, which seems to indicate that the northern half of Division would be cut to 2 lanes, while the section around Belts was going to be some sort of three-lane hybrid.

"The asphalt on division is shot.  To simply replace what we have would cost $49 million.  If we add certain safety improvements (like medians) and bike lanes we can access additional federal dollars.  There is no way this project comes in at less than $49 million if we just replace the asphalt.  As for Plover and Whiting, there are more businesses on that end of town and there is a higher speed limit.  The part of Division from Sentry to 4th will still be 4 lanes, I believe,  from 4th to Patch is mostly residential and Division is a death trap.  I hate to see the preschoolers walking that narrow sidewalk to get to Belts.  From Patch to Whiting is a little trickier but think of it this way--it basically already is two outer lanes with both inner lanes used as turn medians.  If we take it to 2 with dedicated turn medians (like on Michigan) then drivers will only need to focus on crossing one oncoming lane of vehicles instead of two.

>	The southern portion of the project runs from city limits to Patch Street

>	Church Street would become a two-lane road from four lanes with a middle left-turn lane in the middle under the proposed project. This change will span from southern city limits on Church Street to Patch Street.

>	According to planning documents, the lane reductions would not require relocating businesses or homes outside of where the road realignments will be needed.

>	The southern portion of the project calls for changing the boundaries of two intersections, one on Patch Street and one on Rice Street. 

>	How the project plans to revise near downtown Stevens Point

>	The highway would go from a four lanes to a two with a middle left-turn lane between Patch and Ellis streets, as well as between College and Fourth avenues.

>	From Ellis Street to College Avenue, however, the road would have a raised center median instead of a left-turn lane. 

>	The lane reductions would allow the city to use the existing road to create pedestrian islands and 6 feet of grass on each side as a buffer between traffic and pedestrians, according to project documents.

>	Fourth Avenue, however, would see arguably the most significant change of the three-phase project, which calls for creating a roundabout that includes islands for pedestrian and bicycle crossings.",t2_flacu,ganzhimself,0,1631835101.0,0,t1_hd55dbo,hd55dbo,True,Tcvang1,t3_ppodet,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevensPoint/comments/ppodet/keep_church_street_four_lanes/,Keep Church Street four lanes??,/r/StevensPoint/comments/ppodet/keep_church_street_four_lanes/hd55dbo/,6,r/StevensPoint,0,6

"I can only speak from my experience, but Redeemer Church on Brillowski offers some pretty good resources on the matter, both in person and otherwise. I met with a group there a couple times, and it wasn't a heavy-handed ""religious"" experience either.

Something they provided for me was the book series ""Journeying through Grief"" by Kenneth Haugk, and I do recommend it. Again, it's a ""lightly religious"" thing that you can get for free from pretty much any church in the area, and they're pretty quick reads. The author makes it clear from the jump that the books won't make you ""feel better"" but will instead help break down what you're likely going through, and how that can be expressed in ways that are at the very least self destructive. For me, it really helped a lot.

My condolences to you, I wish there was something more I could offer, but there's not much that helps the sort of hurt you're going through. For what it's worth, I'm more than happy to chat with you if you'd like. I'm not the quickest to respond, but I'm around.

"Around North point. I saw a college girl pee next to a garage tonight and thought... It will be easier to sleep to get to work at 5am there. I'm currently across from the YMCA. It's a bit noisy until three. This place is a distance. A good chance my cats will see deer! And it's two level, this place is a box. Tiny and expensive. We're getting a yard back. I'm growing tomatoes that are close to fruiting and was worrying. Last year when I first got the new landlord the new neighbor crushed them and the entire garden. Seeing the replacements for the others she evicted I'm realizing they are catering to college kids or people on disability. I thought the one that kept creeping into my place was strange but move and my neighbors leases aren't being renewed and the new people who moved in like to yell at people who aren't there. I thought they were being racist but they just want people with dedicated income. Screw this new Portage county property management. However, they are now specializing in section 8. No complaints but I've been denied several applications for bad credit. Kind of upset how difficult it was too give a home when I have enough to pay deposit and rent and I didn't even get a stimulus but I'm not good enough to have a fucking home? I'm working my ass off shipping groceries to grocery stores and I'm not good enough to fucking live in a building? I want to quit.

Sorry. I had a few and my mom's dying of cancer as well. Something StMichaels could have diagnosed before it got to her throat or brain. She was hospitalized for lung trouble when I was caring for her and if they would have looked they may have seen a tumor that was not just easily identified, but had spread to terminal. She can't remember anything new now and keeps thinking she's getting better and will come back home. I'm kind of a mess. Glad fixing a home isn't a worry anymore, just wish I could stop thinking about the cancer on my mom's face so I can sleep to work tomorrow. Been up a few days.

Here’s a video of it brought up at the school board.  It happens around 10:56 into the video.
The meaning these parents think this picture means is incorrect.  We’re suppose to be accepting.  It takes a few parents who aren’t getting it to not having this picture shown.  The student was promoting acceptance of everyone.  The fist is a symbol BLM not a revolutionary symbol.   The student was promoting folks to be tolerant and accepting of others.  Shutting this whole thing down isn’t fair to the students and not letting the students voice be heard to what it really means!  Shame on the folks who did this!  It also would’ve been nice if the students parents would’ve been notified versus finding out a month later!!!",t2_c2vwg595,No-Reference7156,0,1620781733.0,0,t1_gxsu73b,gxsu73b,True,AnonMom9876,t3_n27q42,https://www.reddit.com/r/StevensPoint/comments/n27q42/student_planner_art_entry_deemed_too_divisive/,"Student Planner Art Entry Deemed too ""Divisive""",/r/StevensPoint/comments/n27q42/student_planner_art_entry_deemed_too_divisive/gxsu73b/,4,r/StevensPoint,0,4

"I guess I fail to see how this could be construed as ""divisive"" in nature- the messaging is literally to get along and work together.

I guess the only point that ""might"" (and that's a slim might) is the power fist, but that's been a symbol of resistance against injustice since the 1960's- namely against white supremacy and segregation.

To me it sounds like some local parents had their own bigoted ideologies challenged by student artwork and their reaction was to try and stifle it. That the school went along with this is as shameful as it is unbelievable.

I'll make some calls on Monday. I make no promises as I'm just one person, but I'd like to hear from them exactly what was deemed ""divisive"" about this.

"This is because my landlord died and I think his daughter who took over might be racist. I pay rent, she doesn't do this to the other neighbors except the black one. It's like my fourth one she I'm done. If you're about to rent here from these people, make sure you're white. If your native or black you get this...


I'm just moving. She's been trying to evict me for a year and I realize I can just go anywhere else and not get harassed.  Btw I'm 40 my wife is 50. I've never had this happen to me before. I decided to just warn others about this. My white neighbors love her, but those of us not white are not welcome.

""Where things stand
Judd Legum
Jan 14

A week ago, Popular Information began contacting 144 companies and asked if they would continue supporting the Republican members of Congress who objected to the certification of the Electoral College. By the time we published our first report, on Sunday morning, three companies — Marriott, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Commerce Bank — responded that they would suspend donations to the 147 members that tried to subvert the democratic process. This quickly became national news. 

Today, at least two dozen major corporations have suspended their donations to the Republican objectors, a group that includes two-thirds of the Republicans in Congress. The list of companies cutting off their financial support now includes Walmart, Amazon, Disney, Verizon, GE, Airbnb, Comcast, Morgan Stanley, Nike, American Express, and Dell. 

This is something that has never happened before. And the significance is reflected in the coverage.""

"STEVENS POINT – Police officers said they witnessed their former chief smelling of alcohol on the job at least a half dozen times since 2017 but feared retaliation for reporting him, according to a report obtained by the Stevens Point Journal.

An independent investigative report on Stevens Point Police Chief Martin Skibba found wide-ranging complaints about his behavior that included several instances of the chief appearing to be drunk while serving in an official capacity, making sexist and racist comments and creating a workplace environment where officers felt afraid to speak out for fear of jeopardizing their careers. 

In response to a request from the Journal under the state's public records law, the Stevens Point Police and Fire Commission this week released a 71-page internal investigation report compiled by Wausau police. Wausau investigators interviewed Skibba, 10 officers and three other people in the department.

The report outlines seven times where Wausau police believe evidence exists that Skibba was on duty while intoxicated, including the Feb. 26 incident that led to his resignation in June.

The commission requested the investigation by Wausau police in late April after the officers' union voted 37-0 that it had no confidence in Skibba as their chief, who had been suspended in March. Skibba resigned in mid-June before the commission could address the findings of the report from Wausau and further investigate the statements made by the officers. 

The report ranks claims made by officers in terms of how much evidence there is to support them. Investigators said substantial evidence exists that Skibba violated city and department policies regarding on-duty alcohol consumption at a Citizens Academy graduation in 2017, a City Council meeting in 2018 and the Feb. 26 incident where the department's assistant chiefs placed him on administrative leave after a breath test showed his blood alcohol content at 0.036%. 



Investigators said other evidence suggests Skibba smelled of alcohol at work on four other occasions and that he made profane, discriminatory or otherwise derogatory comments, sometimes directed at officers themselves. Multiple officers told investigators that he referred to the department's records staff as ""the (c-words),"" called one officer a ""wop"" and made derogatory comments about Hmong people. The investigators left it up to the commission to determine whether that evidence was substantial enough to warrant discipline. 

In a letter prefacing the report, the commission's attorney, Dean Dietrich, wrote that the commission did not pursue a further review of the issues raised by officers as compiled by Wausau police because Skibba resigned.

""The information that is included in this release of public records was not reviewed and confirmed in any way by the Stevens Point Police and Fire Commission,"" Dietrich wrote.

Skibba denied much of the behavior described by his officers, including saying sexist and ethnic slurs, when interviewed by Wausau police. 

Inside the department, officers told investigators the March public statement from Skibba, which characterized his drinking as a one-time occurrence, was untruthful, or as one officer told Wausau investigators, it was a ""bunch of sh--."" Skibba's drinking seemed to amount to an open secret among officers as early as November 2017, which is where the report begins. 


Concerns about chief's intoxication started at least three years ago

The investigation report lays out these incidents during which witnesses said they thought Skibba had been drinking while on the job:

► Citizens Academy graduation, Nov. 9, 2017: Six officers saw Skibba displaying what they described as atypical, erratic behavior sometime after 6 p.m. in the department's old headquarters at the City-County Building before a Citizens Academy graduation across the street at the Portage County Sheriff's Office.

None of the officers, three years later, could describe exact statements he made but five of the officers recalled Skibba wreaking of alcohol. They described his comments as being unprofessional and making them feel uncomfortable.

None of the officers reported the incident because some feared retaliation or their supervisors were present in the room, according to the report

At the graduation ceremony, a reporter not employed by the Stevens Point Journal observed and reported to the city's assistant chiefs that Skibba was drunk. They didn't confront Skibba that night because he already left. When someone did confront him the next day, he said ""So that's out there.""  

An unidentified leader in the department said they would notify the Police and Fire Commission to begin an investigation. City Attorney Andrew Beveridge and the city's human resources manager then met with Skibba weeks later. Skibba denied being drunk that night and told them the odor was coming from a cough drop.

The Stevens Point Journal requested Skibba's personnel file following his resignation. That file, which was previously released, did not contain any other complaints about his drinking.

Beveridge wrote in a memo to the commission he didn't pursue the matter further because of a lack of physical evidence or an admission from Skibba.

""If I was presented with a case where the only evidence was witness testimony about the odor of an intoxicant, I would ask the court to dismiss the citation for a lack of evidence,"" he wrote. 

When questioned by Wausau investigators in May, Skibba said again that the smell came from a cough drop and that he had consumed large amounts of cough medicine because he had a cold. 

► Stevens Point City Council, Feb. 19, 2018: Three months later, the same reporter notified the department's assistant chiefs that Skibba appeared to be drunk at a City Council meeting. Following the two-and-a-half-hour meeting, the assistant chiefs confronted him. Skibba submitted to a breath test that showed a 0.016% blood-alcohol content, and said he drank alcohol at dinner before the 7 p.m. meeting. No one informed the commission of this incident before the commission suspended Skibba earlier this year. 

► Police and Fire Commission, August 2018: An officer told investigators they smelled alcohol on Skibba when they were at the lectern together during a 4 p.m. Police and Fire Commission meeting. The officer did not report the incident at the time. Someone who sat next to Skibba at that meeting told investigators they did not smell alcohol on him.

► Private meeting, fall 2018: An officer smelled a strong odor of alcohol on Skibba during a 5 p.m. private meeting. The officer did not report the incident out of fear of retaliation when it came to a possible promotion.

► Debriefing, Jan. 27, 2020: A year and a half later, two officers smelled alcohol on Skibba just before a 10 a.m. meeting on Jan. 27. Neither officer reported the incident.

► Car ride, Feb. 17: A little more than a week before assistant chiefs Mike Rottier and Tom Zenner placed Skibba on leave, an officer gave Skibba a 7 a.m. ride to the city's maintenance facility so the chief could pick up his car. The officer smelled alcohol on Skibba on the ride over but didn't report the incident because he wasn't sure if it was leftover from the night before. He also feared retaliation.

Skibba did not immediately return a phone call from the Stevens Point Journal to discuss the investigation's findings.

"Yeah. Things are crazy here. I got a crazy trump neighbor who's been screaming about trump since she moved in. Said I'm a looter and she's going to get me evicted. Well, I should have heeded her warning. I've done all kinds of crazy things I didn't know about to her since she moved in and I'm getting evicted because of it. I'm certainly taking it to court though, nothing about this is right. You can't just create problems and blame others and let that be okay. Or I hope we're not living in that kind of world. .. What am I saying. My family is being kicked onto the streets for literally doing nothing but some random crazy lady's crap.  

Seriuosly, the past two months have been accusations about stealing my own things. (She moved in before the previous tenants things were removed from the basement and she's claiming they are hers. She has receipts people!) Not only that, the laundry and dryer that's been here for years is hers and she made it so we could no longer use it! Not only that, apparently we did something to it that created grey streaks in her clothing! Not only that though! We run up and down her stairs slamming her door and running away. Not only that though! We broke the garden hose (after our garden was stomped down mysteriously) and caused thousands of gallons to leak. (The back faucet's been broken since before I moved in, the previous tenant complained about it too. Much like how I don't have the key to our doors, it's not fixed.) 

For the most part, be careful of Karen Northwood. She's my third landlord and she threw out all previous agreements I had about my Mom being here and she's siding with the neighbor who just moved in and doesn't wonder why someone who's been here for a good while now never had any problems with anything until some woman I told her about immediately showed up with odd threats. 

I had to complain, sorry guys. This has been the weirdest shit I've ever been through. I think I'll just move our stuff to the street and try staying there when it happens. Well.... I'm fighting this in court. You can't just make up shit about people to get them evicted. I wish I wasn't Native, this is feeling pretty racial right now. I think that's what I did wrong.

"According to the article, it was at District 1 Brewing, which is in the big strip mall next to Dollar Tree on the north side, right on Division Street.

I assume that they ran it because it was open air and people were less likely to be in super close proximity to each other, but that's only a guess on my part.

As for the virus, I've heard rumor from students that some people have tested positive at UWSP, though I've no way to verify it's validity. I would not be surprised if that were the case though- even if all safety precautions are taken, that's still a lot of people from all over coming together and interacting, so the odds of transmission are always going to be higher than virtual courses.

I only see this as a positive for the city. Improving infrastructure so that cyclists (many of whom are university students) feel safer riding on the streets could be a make-it or break-it for prospective students.
