"Tech recruiters in the Bay Area look at 3 primary factors when reviewing resumes for new grads: prestige of school, relevancy of your internships, and whether you're part of an under-represented group (since there's such a short supply of female, black or LatinX software engineers in this area) . I'm not saying I agree with this kind of assessment but it is what it is. If you ended up at a non top tier school, make sure you get involved with open-source projects or be active on github so you'll have exposure to non-academic software development.

Every year, FAANG companies get thousands of resumes for new grads, and if you want to work for a FAANG company, you'll need to stand out, if this is your dream. If you want want to work as an engineer at non-FAANG companies, then the school matters less.  Also, for the record, I hate the usage of the word ""LatinX"" and/or the classifications of what's considered to be under-represented talent but that's what we're told by the powers that be. Pro-tip: start looking for summer internships 5-7 months in advance, not 1-2 months ahead.

"Both of my parents were professors at CSUS.  I’m from Sac.  I got in to Davis and they said that they didn’t even want me considering CSUS anymore.  They shot down UCSC because they were still doing some classes without grades (you get some sort of written assessment).  

Pretty much UC > CSU, with a couple of caveats:

CalPoly is legit.  
SJSU is the best CSU for CompSci.  Mostly because of proximity. Proximity helps a lot.  (Downside - you gotta deal with housing and I don’t even know how that works.)

Basically, in my mind, when it comes to school rep it goes (for California public schools)

Cal > UCLA > UCSD > UCI > UCD > CalPoly > SJSU > Other UCs > Other CSU.

The further down this list you go then there are more things to consider.  CalPoly might be stronger than SJSU, but being in SJ means you can interview easier, you aren’t moving to a new city when you graduate, etc.  So think it through.

Another thing to consider: Transfer programs.  

Your first two years are all lower-division basic stuff.  There are some very good community colleges that will do a much better job at teaching you that stuff than a big school will.  If you haven’t AP-tested out of things like Calculus then you’ll have a much easier time with that stuff at a good community college.  

At a big school like UCD you’ll be in Chem 194 (if that’s still around) with everyone else in Math21A.  Like 500 people or something and then maybe you have a TA who cares and maybe you don’t.  At a community college you’ll have someone who wants to teach people that stuff.

"Your average recruiter, over the long term, is going to see the college you went to and not your grades.  I've forgotten my GPA because nobody cares.  If I'm sorting resumes, I'm ignoring it.  It's probably useful if you want to go to grad school or something.

I went to one of the better CS schools and some of the recruiters have waxed poetic about my alma matter in ways that made me frankly uncomfortable on behalf of everybody who went to a ""lesser"" school because I know that a good chunk of them are just as smart and talented as I am, just a little less lucky about one or two things.

Furthermore, the esteem of the school is going to determine who goes to the career fairs, who does internships and co-ops, et al. which then means that your first job will be somewhere that has more esteem.

Also, networking.  Because of the aforementioned barriers, folks from a school with more ""esteem"" will get hired at places with more ""esteem"" and most people get jobs and opportunities from their social network.

The ""best"" schools are the ones who have profs who suck at teaching, do research, and assign you hard problems.  Most of the ""lesser"" schools will actually make an effort to teach.  If you make it through one of the ""best"" schools, you are probably a really quite decent auto-didactic learner and that's actually a useful skill, I guess, but it feels abusive to me.

Understand that there's basically no difference between a smart person without a college education versus with one after they've been in the industry for a while.  I know a bunch of people from an unconventional background and it's a risky road because all of them have faced hiring discrimination on account of not having a degree, but it does show that the whole school thing is downright silly.

Understand that the hiring process in tech is a facade.  Underneath, a good chunk of the steps are mostly there to make sure that you are the right gender, race, and class... and if you are LGBTQ you aren't LGBTQ in such a way that would make the straights uncomfortable.  As such, if you aren't part of the super-privileged class, all of the career advice oriented towards people who differ from you by a mere accident of birth isn't going to be especially helpful.",t2_1q0a,wirehead,0,1648783608.0,0,t1_i2xtcvi,i2xtcvi,True,mugggly,t3_ttfykw,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/ttfykw/prospective_software_engineer_in_need_of_advice/,Prospective Software Engineer In Need of Advice!,/r/siliconvalley/comments/ttfykw/prospective_software_engineer_in_need_of_advice/i2xtcvi/,5,r/siliconvalley,0,5

"Elizabeth Holmes is a great example of mass stupidity.  Theranos should have never happened.  People wanted to believe it. I wanted to believe it. It was a great story. Stanford drop out, has an idea to make health care cheaper such that health care -- one of the most expensive and rapidly-getting-more-expensive parts of every American's life -- could be significantly reduced in cost.  I was one of the people who bought in to this.  I saw her testifying on CSPAN about how she could perform lab tests for fractions of the Medicare pay rate.  This tech, if it were to work, would have been a game changer for the US health system. I didn't care about the ""one drop"" stuff....so what...not a big deal.  The price was everything. 

Then it became more obvious that this was a scam.  There were no scientists or physicians on her board.  But wait -- she's testifying before congress -- nobody would be so bold as to lie straight to the faces of congress? 

Then I had coffee with a friend who was a pathologist about 6 months before the story broke in the WSJ. He explained to me why what she was doing was scientifically impossible.  You simply can't get the values that she claimed to report from the first drop of blood that comes from a finger.  If anyone knowledgeable had evaluated her claims, they'd quickly know it was a fraud.  I still wanted to believe she was the real deal at that point but it was obvious that she wasn't.

> 
> ""I can neither confirm or deny where I got these records"" she replied.

> She told me that I need to send a followup statement redacting everything I had told them, or I would be legally liable for millions of dollars in lost investments, to which I immediately agreed. She then handed me a stack of documents to sign.

> Standing, she removed her jacket and hung it on her chair, revealing a silky black turtleneck underneath. Moving to the side of the desk, she pulled a straight-back chair to the center of the room and sat down on it, hiking her beige skirt to the top of her thighs. I felt my cock responding to the alluring sight.
> 
> ""One further thing,"" she informed me, ""all spankings take place on the bare bottom.""
> 
> Again I sputtered a protest but she gave me the same ultimatum. I was being dragged deeper and deeper into something entirely new and unknown. Nodding my head, I lowered my pants and went to lie across her lap, but she stopped me saying,
> 
> ""When I said bare-bottomed I meant it! I think it is going to be much easier if you strip completely naked. It makes it much less complicated. Now!.""
> 
> I took a deep breath and started removing my clothes. Shoes, socks, shirt and trousers were quickly discarded. Only my red Y-front underwear remained but my hands would not take the final step. Elizabeth seemed to sense this and motioned for me to come over in front of her. While explaining that this was all for my own good, she very slowly started tugging my underwear down past my hips.

"Get a motorcycle, trust me.

When I lived in the Bay Area if you needed to drive somewhere, 100,000 other people did too. 101 was obscene into SF and back. You think, ""Oh, LG won't be that bad!"", wrong. Every BA area is that bad at any time a person would think to get in a car to go somewhere during normal hours.

The only saving grace was a motorcycle. See, cuz in California you can split lanes. This means you can bypass all traffic by driving right along side them (ride the dotted lines in between them, not the fucking shoulder!)

San Mateo to DT SF? 15 minutes. Anytime.

You can literally pass everyone and everything and it feels safer than you would expect, because for as much shit as people give California, they have the most courteous drivers I've ever met when it comes to motorcyclists. I've ridden tens of thousands of miles all over that state, they understand what splitting lanes means and they get over for bikes if they're going slower in the fast lane and there's room to get over.

Seriously. If you can, get a motorcycle and then where you live becomes way less of an issue. If not, then you're well and truly fucked with the commute and my only other option would be to get a Tesla and put it on AP for the drive and let it deal with stop-and-go.

"Honestly, you don't want to be a TPM if you're inexperienced. There's a lot of judgement and leadership that comes into doing the job well. 

I stress that if you're inexperienced, do yourself a favor and wait the 5 years. Nothing is worse than fucking a project up because of your own decision-making, and then have to own that in front of senior leaders of your company. Not to mention, when things get fucked up in general, people will look for you to help guide their way out. If your overall experience of operational practices, and your soft skills are low, you're going to have a very bad time. 

One thing you haven't explained is why you would like to pivot to product management or TPM? I should stress Product Maagement and TPM are very much not the same role and are not interchangeable, in some companies they work very very closely together but you should do some more research before plotting your path and committing to it. Based on the fact that you have technical expertise, I'd encourage you to become a junior product manager first, and do that for a few years.

"Los Gatos is essentially just a neighborhood of the San Jose metro. SJ is big, so it all depends on which part. You’re closer to it if you live in West SJ, but if you live anywhere else, it can get traffic. 

If you do stick to West SJ, you wont be really taking the main artery freeways (280, 101), which are the extremely traffic areas. You’ll likely just take the 17, 87, or the San Tomas Expressway. None of these are as traffic as the main freeways I just mentioned. 

As a young person, I’d personally live in Santa Clara or Sunnyvale as they have a ton of new dense apartment complexes. Los Gatos area is just too sleepy for me. Its very old money retirees. Don’t get me wrong, its nice & perfect for families, but theres hardly any apartments there.

I added the books I haven't read to my goodreads. I can't find Startup by Riko Radojcic. Seems to be self published. 

Bad Blood by John Carreyrou is the most thriller book on the list. 

Elon Musk by Ashlee Vance was a fun read at the time, but so much has happened since, as a lot more has come out about his personality, I am wondering if an updated book has come out since. Walter Issacson is writing a book about Elon but who knows how long that will take. 

Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is a fun read. Did you like watching Michael Scott from the office? Well Steve Jobs has many Michael Scott-ish moments captured in the book. 

I've read about a dozen or so books about silicon valley, out of those, besides the ones already mentioned, these are also the top entertaining ones.

"I was educated in the Bay Area, and spent my first two years in Valley startups before joining FAANG. There was just an incredible amount of hype, good positive energy, and innovation during those golden years throughout college and my early career.

There was no other time and place in the history of the world like that.

Nowadays? I feel like COVID has effectively decentralized innovation for the better. FAANG is still prestigious, but as a cultural institution it is no longer untouchable. A lot of exciting stuff, whether in finance or AI or other edge fields, is happening in Asia and Europe.

"First, your employer should give you a good freaking laptop for you to use for work things.  The cost of getting a cheap economical nasty laptop is way low in the economics of hiring you.  Also, if you use your personal laptop for work stuff, if someone happens to file a lawsuit that might include data on your personal laptop, they will want to image your laptop and some tech might end up pawing through your personal shit.

(Yeah, it's bullshit, there ought to be a reasonable way to enforce a container or virtual machine thing that's legally OK, but case law is generally determined by lawyers and judges who don't fully understand things)

Second, most groups have a standard laptop and you may or may not want to deviate from it.  In a well-functioning engineering group, they'll actually spend a bit of time making the mac setup experience for new people really good and so if you pick the non-standard setup, you'll spend your first few weeks in catch-up trying to get things to work.  This should be a conversation with your hiring manager where it pays to not be too opinionated.  Remember, their hardware not yours.

Third, the actual vitally important thing is to be conversant with the Unix prompt.  It's been the case for at least a decade that people in the cool and not-so-cool Silicon Valley crowd avoid using the whole Microsoft web stack thing with Windows Server and ASP.NET and everything so it's not like you are going to be actually doing *windows* development, you are always targeting a thing that runs on a Linux image in the cloud.  Same goes for MacOS.  WSL is pretty great, in many ways it's actually less annoying at this point than the MacOS command line, so if you are looking to better yourself on the side, a Windows laptop is probably just fine.  And, honestly, Apple has been ignoring the needs of people who want to develop things that aren't iOS applications.

Fourth, if you want to develop iOS applications, you might be stuck with a mac.

"This is a tangent from OPs question, but I'm curious about a few things because our company recently switched to ""Okta"" for single sign on:

> our single sign on authentication stuff is like butter on the Mac and awful on windows

Do you know what software your company uses?  Our company hosts email and calendaring on Google Workspace, and up until recently used Google Workspace as the single sign on to many of our apps.  Recently we changed to ""Okta"" and it works ok, but there have been a few issues.  It's definitely clunky and clumsy and the documentation is literally all wrong.  I worry they might go out of business because nobody is maintaining their product and it looks so old and tired.  Plus there doesn't seem to be any reason to use Okta, it must make the IT people happy for some reason because we switched to a worse system.  LOL.

> Our information security people hate windows machines and scan the network looking for them.

Get better information security people that aren't bigots.  Employees with a religious devotion to one platform or against a WIDELY used platform is **BAD FOR BUSINESS**.  Windows is perfectly fine, and runs on 75% of the world's desktops.  Macintosh is also perfectly fine and runs on 16% of the world's desktops.  Chrome OS at 6% of the world's desktops is fine.  Even if you develop a pure web based product or even just a website, you should have internal people testing your own product with Windows - and different web browsers on Windows.  It's even better to have regular developers and people at your company using Windows everyday, just to understand that customer base.  What kind of lunatic company wants to exclude 75% of their possible customers?  What kind of self destructive company wants to exclude the most widely used desktop OS on earth?

> all the software that is licensed and calendaring and email is all apple and 

As I mentioned, we use Google Workspace - the calendaring works completely seamlessly on both Windows and Macintosh and iOS and Android!!  Why would your org tie itself to a piece of software that didn't work well on both?!

> the windows person gets left out in some collaborative work because you can't as easily share 

Dropbox works on both, as do 50 other sharing apps.  Text messages can be sent to iOS or Android or the desktop OS's.  SMB file sharing works on both.  Email can be sent and received on both.  Google Meet and Zoom work on both.  Slack works on both.  Our developers happen to use GitHub for source control right now, it works on both Mac and Windows (and Linux).  We use the same identical source tree and compile on both Mac and Windows this way.

> Moving to the mac was a hard row for me, but now I would never go back.

Don't ever ""go back to just one"", the right thing to do is: ""use both"".  If you want to play 3D video games with a full size graphics card from Nvidia, the only possible choice is Windows.  Personally I like editing videos using Final Cut Pro on the Macintosh.  Computers are just tools in your quiver, not a mutually exclusive religion where you have to ""choose one"".  This is especially obvious when you start realizing there are so many computers in your life: your watch might be a FitBit or Apple Watch, your desktop computer might be Macintosh, and your phone might be Android, and your web server changes with every website you visit from .NET to Java to ARM processors to Intel processors.  The Tesla you drive is probably running some variant of Linux, your WiFi router might be something else.  The point of sale machine when you buy something in a store might be something else.  Trying to exclude an operating system from your life is tilting at windmills - it's a pointless fight, there is no profit in it.

My wife isn't a developer, she was in HR and large account management (post sales).  She's now bi-lingual which makes me proud of her: she mostly uses a Windows laptop during the day, and a Mac laptop when she travels and if she's sitting in bed.  They just aren't that different when you are using an app like watching Netflix.  You don't touch the keyboard and mouse, the movie plays in full screen, the audio comes out.  Anybody who claims differently is a bigot who is dangerous to your business's profit line.  

Let the end customers get tricked and marketed to about ""X-Box vs Playstation"" when the answer is incredibly obvious that you should own both.  Let Apple and Google battle to the death over Android vs iPhone, your organization should support both and shouldn't care which one wins - it isn't your company's fight.

"You mentioned price a couple of times, but every place I've ever worked provides you with maxed out equipment, so you should scratch that from your list of concerns/considerations.

> If I was working for a Silicon Valley company as a software engineer (web developer), would I be okay using Windows, or do I just have to use a MacBook?

It matters the company, and it's Ok to ask in the interview.  Everybody wants a good fit, both you and the company you might work for.  I think when you said this I believe you have the right attitude:

> I don't mind switching to MacBook Pro

At the company I currently work for it is perfectly acceptable to specialize in one platform, but what we ask of every last employee is that they be respectful of other preferences.  For example, we have a dedicated iOS (iPhone) developer, and a dedicated Android developer, and they collaborate cheerfully and with respect on projects to release feature parity.  We have a desktop client that sells on both Windows and Macintosh, and the teams are obviously specialists in their particular platform but know how to compile on the OTHER platform also.  You don't have to love the other platform, but you have to know how to log in, launch the development environment, and hit the right button to compile.  And we'll even teach you how to do it, but you have to be WILLING and have the right attitude (not disdainful of the other platforms).

We used to have some Java developers on Windows, and some on Macintosh - and no matter what 100% of the web Java and also HTML is deployed on Linux servers in the datacenter.  Along the way, they all decided it the Mac was just a little bit more like Linux and it was easier to keep everything working if all the Java people all used Mac.  But it was a collaborative decision, the Windows people agreed to move over. 

In our company, most of the accounting department uses Windows.  A lot of the rest of the company uses Mac.  About 20 years ago it was all different, the only Macintosh in the entire company I worked at then belonged to the graphic artist, but that's also Ok.  The technical support group at my current company all support customers running iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, and Linux - so the are multi-lingual.  Probably about 1/2 of the company carries an iPhone in their pocket as their personal phone, the other half carries Android.

As a developer, if you have a long career, the platform of choice will most likely change.  I started my career on HP-UX (Hewlett Packard's form of Unix) and X-Windows.  Then I worked at Apple for 3 years.  Now I'm primarily a Windows developer.  I've carried Palm-Pre phones, Android phones, and currently happen to carry an iPhone. 

All the operating systems have little advantages and disadvantages, maybe some quirks.  But in the end they are all just a platform to launch your development environment, and THAT is what you will spend all of your time in.  I'd say it is way, WAAAAAY more important what developer tools you use and what the company requires than what underlying OS is running.  All operating systems have memory protection now.  They all support processors with multiple cores.  You can adapt to a new one in a few weeks, and the company will help you adapt and be patient while you learn.  A good developer with the right attitude is worth their weight in gold to the company and to their team regardless the platform being used right now.

Just be a professional - ask in the interview about the tool stack used there, and be honest with what you know and don't know, and (if this is true) tell them you are willing to learn and to ""fit in"" if it is what the team wants.  If a person says that in an interview, they go up a few notches on the ""let's hire this person"" judgement scale.",t2_3m2w4,brianwski,0,1644473930.0,0,t1_hwc36z2,hwc36z2,True,total_cornerstone,t3_sovj34,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/sovj34/can_i_use_windows_with_silicon_valley_companies/,"Can I use Windows with Silicon Valley companies (as an in person or remote developer), or do I just have to use a MacBook Pro?",/r/siliconvalley/comments/sovj34/can_i_use_windows_with_silicon_valley_companies/hwc36z2/,3,r/siliconvalley,0,3

I had a generally good experience with them but keep in mind that a ton of car moving companies are just going to contract it out to someone else so your experience may be VERY different. Also scheduling may be more difficult to align with other deliveries as they like to fill all the slots up on a truck if possible if you are unlucky or are farther away from major highways. The earlier you can schedule the pickup the easier it make for them to save you a spot on a truck without gouging you. I generally booked a month or two prior to pickup.


The ease of setting up the move and communication was fine. Car was ahead of schedule for delivery in both cases which was nice.

"Communication costs.  Programming productivity scales linearly with number of engineers (more people to do work), supra-linearly with quality of engineers (ability to recognize abstractions or simplify the codebase to do more with less), and inverse exponentially with number of engineers (because engineers spend a lot of time communicating with each other).  That means it's usually better to hire a small number of really good engineers and put them in a room together, rather than have a much larger number of worse engineers distributed across the globe.  The latter situation usually fails to produce anything useful at all (which is often the case with companies that outsource IT projects to Indian body shops).",t2_1w5b,nostrademons,0,1643911396.0,0,t1_hvg6xid,hvg6xid,True,RossJD,t3_sj4ltq,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/sj4ltq/why_do_we_spend_a_lot_of_money_on_engineers_in/,Why do we spend a lot of money on engineers in the SF Bay area instead of outsourcing these jobs to Indians?,/r/siliconvalley/comments/sj4ltq/why_do_we_spend_a_lot_of_money_on_engineers_in/hvg6xid/,2,r/siliconvalley,0,2

 Godspeed, host. It’s a grind. Success like that is not really guaranteed. You can only stumble upon it serendipitously, but ultimately, you have to have other people see potential in you and tell you where to go.

""Getting a job through your network"" these days means reaching out to former colleagues and posting on LinkedIn to get tips and possibly references for open roles.

I'm not saying that meeting people isn't useful, but I think you need to do a bit of reading about what constitutes effective networking for marketing, especially bay area tech startup marketing.

I'll be real as well: the people the unicorns-to-be hire as their first marketer are usually 5-10 years into tech marketing, with experience ""wearing many hats"", ideally including being a people manager and hiring a team.

Ive been told I have ""the gift of gab"" by experienced salesman, I have a crazy love for cars, I love music and have a really good ear. I've met plenty of people through my current job and we've chatted about opportunities I could explore with their company. I haven't gone out and made any friends yet, no girls really either. Three really good things I have going for me is.. 1. My level of friendliness and ability to talk to people 2. My ability to work like a dog 3. I am really good looking, but not to girls lol Three things that need work I'd saaayyy 1. Lack of stability off the clock. I was left with a note by my fiancée in the middle of nowhere texas, so I don't go out and have fun really 2. I like to do a million things at once, I draw myself to it 3. I'm ""unrefined"".

"Not sure whether this story is behind a paywall. In case it is, the following are some excerpts I thought were noteworthy:

John Arrillaga, who parlayed holdings of Northern California farmland into an empire of office parks for the emerging tech industry now known as Silicon Valley, reaping billions in the process and establishing himself as one of the state’s foremost developers, died Monday. He was 84.

Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, Arrillaga’s daughter, [confirmed his death](https://medium.com/@johnamemorial/john-arrillaga-1937-2022-ba11ee3818da) in a Medium post.

Richard Peery, Arrillaga’s business partner of 55 years, described him in a statement to *The Real Deal* as “a class act, a principled man and a loyal business partner.” Through their eponymous firm Peery Arrillaga, the duo began turning thousands of acres of orchards in what was then known as the Valley of Heart’s Delight into offices in the 1960s.

The developers completed over 20 million square feet of corporate campuses for companies such as Apple, Cisco Systems, and Intel, and helped transform the area into the nation’s tech mecca. (The valley’s output, pegged at $275 billion in 2019 by the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, is higher than Finland’s.)",t2_4dmy1s5b,mattj8,0,1643100721.0,0,t1_hu4r6p5,hu4r6p5,True,mattj8,t3_sc97jy,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/sc97jy/john_arrillaga_pioneering_silicon_valley/,"John Arrillaga, pioneering Silicon Valley developer, dead at 84",/r/siliconvalley/comments/sc97jy/john_arrillaga_pioneering_silicon_valley/hu4r6p5/,1,r/siliconvalley,0,1

The GBD was the pseudoscientific justification to end lockdowns and mitigations.  It very specifically refers to Herd Immunity in the fist page of the statement.  The statement, which is clearly describing current policy, even goes so far as to make borderline eugenicist points about the infirm.  This has been a driver of ruling class policy since early 2020z

“Fortunately, our understanding of the virus is growing. We know that vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young. Indeed, for children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than many other harms, including influenza.”

It continues 

“The most compassionate approach that balances the risks and benefits of reaching herd immunity, is to allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally to build up immunity to the virus through natural infection, while better protecting those who are at highest risk. We call this Focused Protection.”

How is this not describing current policy?  A policy that currently is leading to a 7 day average death toll of a 9-11 every day.

"Reading some of these comments is really disheartening. 

I don’t think schools ought to shut down, at least not the ones in my area. But I can tell you firsthand this situation is more dynamic and complicated than people are giving it credit for. 

The challenges with remote learning was the lack of experience, disparities in both levels of service and infrastructure, and insufficient familial support at home. If any one of these pieces were missing, students would fall through the cracks. 

This is especially true along socioeconomic lines. Poorer communities that could not monitor their child’s learning as closely and provide support at home fell off. English is also not the primary language in many homes, and the varied educational backgrounds of some communities were also challenges to support at home. Add to this that not every family in the Valley has the luxury of being able to work from home during the pandemic, let alone space or the necessary internet bandwidth to handle 4+ video and audio calls simultaneously. 

To those saying why not host classes in outdoor seating or in the open air haven’t taught a zero period class at 8am in 44 degree weather during the winter months here. Get propane heating? Sure. Who’s gonna roll those things out on the daily? What’s that? Leave them out there? Sure. And let’s see how long before a TikTok challenge gets started to destroy that too. Again, some schools can do this, but at scale, it’s a struggle. 

To those saying private schools haven’t shut down, that’s not true. At least one large private school in my area moved to distance learning last week as cases spiked. 

Money isn’t even the problem. It’s personnel and staffing. Teachers and students are getting sick, and attendance is dropping 20-30% district wide in many cases. In most districts, administrators have even taken to filling the gaps with all hands on deck. 

There aren’t enough subs in the sub pool. Sub pay was just bumped in my district by 30% and the qualification requirements lowered. An increase of 30% is unprecedented in my experience, and an example of how dire things have gotten. 

Teacher pay is wildly out of whack across the board, and the profession is hemorrhaging as more and more elect to ditch the field. Teachers need and deserve to be paid more proportionally to the levels of service they are providing. Taking child development and credential courses (post-baccalaureate, mind you), passing the CalTPA, and clearing your credential takes 4-6 years before you can be fully credentialed. You can smirk and sneer all you want, or be fooled into thinking teaching is easy, but those that do greatly underestimate what goes into the classroom, or just how demanding, expensive, and treacherous the path to even getting in front of students as a trained professional can be. 

Schools, just like Police Departments, are being asked to do more than ever. They’re a necessary link in the chain that makes the economy move, yet are so badly neglected in so many ways. They provide food distribution to entire communities. They provide important counseling and intervention services to students who are at risk or unable to get these services through their own means. They are vaccination sites. They are safe shelters in emergencies and act as distribution sites for relief during such emergencies.

Tl;dr: it’s much more complicated and dynamic than people think. There isn’t a single answer to this problem, and I wish people would stop oversimplifying or making trivial the matter of public education.",t2_akvil,Cmdrrom,0,1642597862.0,0,t1_htbajhg,htbajhg,True,WSWS-Brian_Gene,t3_s77r3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/s77r3q/student_strike_in_oakland_to_close_schools_due_to/,Student Strike in Oakland to Close Schools Due to COVID,/r/siliconvalley/comments/s77r3q/student_strike_in_oakland_to_close_schools_due_to/htbajhg/,1,r/siliconvalley,0,1

"Yes and no. My spouse works at a FAANG company whose in-office benefits (at least before the pandemic) could lure you into spending all your time there: free food morning to night at the cafeteria, free food 24/7 in the snack room, nap pods, shower, gym, employee-organized social activities, etc. 

I have a single friend who gave up his apartment and slept in a van in their parking lot to save rent. Other employees of this company unplug the fridge in their homes to save electricity because they only eat at the office anyway (in fairness, that cafeteria is epic and I believe my husband only continues to eat my cooking to be polite).

Must see:

\- Walk across the golden gate bridge

\- Go see the old growth redwood trees in Felton, CA, Henry Cowell State Park.

\- Monterey Bay Aquarium

\- Rodan Sculpture Garden on Stanford University

If you have time

\- The Tech Museum downtown San Jose.   Childrens discovery museum near there is pretty interesting for young ones.

\- Alcatraz

\- A few Tech Headquarters are interesting.   Apple, Nvidia, Intel (has their own museum), The HP Garage in Palo Alto

\- California Missions (1770s), there are a few to choose from, Santa Clara, Fremont, San Juan Batista, but probably the nicest one is in Carmel (Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo)

"I (mid twenties M) am a SWE working for a FAANG company based in Silicon Valley but work in the Seattle office. While there are differences in culture between the two locations, the working style and expectations are almost exactly the same.

>working environment

Our office is an open office, meaning many workers are seated together on huge tables in close proximity to each other with no boundaries. Work overall is very collaborative and social. We also have many amenities such as free snacks, coffees (we have a $20000 espresso setup on every floor), free breakfast/lunch/dinner. In Silicon Valley / SF in particular, the amount of amenities vary but employees are treated pretty well overall.

>self development 

Our company holds a large set of offerings for developing in-house talent: videos, courses, webinars, wikis etc. I find that I learn a lot of state-of-the-art techniques and domain knowledge that I can easily transfer outside of my job and into jobs with similar roles.

>work life balance

In my company, and likely other companies, work life balance varies massively. From first-hand accounts, I know some teams like the mobile core OS team have 20 hour weeks and no on call shifts, while some teams are a consistent 40-50 hour work weeks with monthly on call shifts.

>daily life style

Because of my work, I am afforded a great deal of freedom with regards to developing my career and my interests (hobbies, reading, etc.) . I am truly fortunate and proud of the work that I have put in to get where I am today :)

>how cool is your tech stacks

If you work in a huge company, as in FAANG, you are looking at hundreds of different tech stacks serving different purposes. From pure C and assembler code to interface with cold storage tape drivers, to MySQL-Go-React web stacks interfacing with beastly C++ services powering multibillion user load applications, it really does vary tremendously with large companies. For a lot of startups, in SF especially, I see a lot of tech stacks tend to use Go-Rust-React-Redis-MySQL (Rust is taking off tremendously!!). Deployment and CI/CD solutions vary.

>Which agile methods do you use for different products

In my company, we are VERY Agile. Only weekly standups and roadmaps. This is something that I liked better than my previous FAANG job, where it was very waterfall-agile. So I guess this varies a lot per company. What is universal though: everyone hates standup meetings.

>How close your teams are with the updated AI research either in recommendation or rankings systems. Or just these days machine learning and AI buzz is on a low tide.

My company is, I believe, one of the top 2 or 3 worldwide in terms of innovation in AI/ML due to sheer size. We consistently plow tens of billions into hiring the best and resourcing for improving the AI/ML ecosystem that we've built. For startups specializing in AI/ML, I believe the hype has cooled down.

"I'm in DevOps/build and release but I can share what I have learned.  

Working environments seem to have my manager as the driving factor to generate a close team culture (or not!)  that is unique in every position.  I've had everyone from clueless idiots to jerks to absolutely great people who I completely enjoyed working with and sometimes people had all of these qualities to some degree.  

Self development seems to happen two ways:  getting a new job or learning something new on the job.  Generally, I've learned the most bouncing from one contract to another, which is like 90% of the available jobs in devops--YMMV.  Contracts are easy to get into and unfortunately easy to get out of.

Work/life balance is something you just have to watch what your coworkers are doing.  Moral support for somebody working late by staying late was a great way to build relationships in the pre-covid days, which at this point I miss.  

With mostly everyone working from home, the daily life style has gotten easier but I seriously miss the interaction I had with coworkers.  It's a complex series of tradeoffs.  I don't spend my entire weekends sleeping like I used to.  My last contract was all on site but I just didn't like most of my coworkers and would never want to grab a beer with them after work or getting lunch, not that was possible in the armpit of the Bay Area like Newark.  I've found that these suburban/exurban ""tech campuses"" across the Bay Area are fucking awful for so many reasons.  Daily life just depends on the employer and where they are and where you live.

"I wouldn’t necessarily recommend waiting to move here until things calm down.

First, it’s hard to say exactly when things will actually calm down. It could be months or years and each company will take its own path forward.

Second, there is a huge demand for tech workers at the moment. So lots of opportunities with high wages and great benefits. Who knows how long this will last so it is good to take advantage of it now in my opinion.

Third, it generally doesn’t make sense to put your career on hold and wait. That translates into lost earnings, growth and opportunities.

Fourth, the vast majority of tech companies are still headquartered around the Bay Area and even most of those that aren’t have a huge presence here. If you want to be part of this world, there is no bad time to enter it so why not now?

Fifth, if real estate or housing costs are a concern, that won’t likely change in the future. Housing is expensive here and likely always will be. Waiting won’t necessarily help and even during Covid, prices have skyrocketed. Like people say in real estate, don’t try to time the market.

Definitely. A lot of remote workers *can't* return to the office because they already bought a house for $400k in Texas or similar.

"It is hard to know for certain, but my prediction is that it will mostly return to normal. I suspect that many are offered will start with working from home sometimes and coming into the office sometimes, and it will slowly shift to nearly everyone coming into the office.

"Many of the large companies have not returned to working from the office in any substantial capacity yet. Omicron will certainly delay return to office further. Santa Clara County has a mask mandate for all indoor activities that don't explicitly prohibit mask wearing (e.g. dental work, swimming, eating), so still choose to work from home.

I don't recommend moving to Silicon Valley until COVID restrictions calm down. You'll get all of the down sides of high cost of living and none of the benefits of working closely with amazing colleagues.

\*edit\* as for the future -- hard to tell yet, but I do think it will return to mostly to normal once COVID restrictions are gone. We had a brief time when mask mandates were lifted and the people I met in the office were so happy to see each other again. I do like that many will be given the option to work remotely.

"I'll sorta echo what others have said.  PA is very suburban; if you're comparing it to SD it's kind of the equivalent of living in La Jolla.  Everything closes kinda early and there is not much real nightlife or anything to speak of (though there is a pretty good food scene).

Most of the ""culture"" in the Bay Area per se is really focused on SF itself, with maybe some in Oakland or San Jose.  I think the recommendation to live by Caltrain is a good one; that will let you poke up to SF as needed for weekend activities.  One thing to understand though is that the train basically stops running at midnight, and Caltrain's terminal station in SF is far from everything, so if you want to go up to SF on a Friday night and are expecting to stay at a venue or activity past 11pm, you will need to budget for a hotel or crash on a friend's couch.  Also plan on using Uber a lot.

Really I think the way you're thinking about Palo Alto though is a bit wrong.  You can't compare a place like Palo Alto to San Diego...SD is a metro area and PA is just one part of the South Bay, which is really a conglomeration of small communities that collectively make up one urban unit (like, how you wouldn't really say ""Santa Ana"" or ""Laguna Beach"", you'd say ""Orange County""...even though those are all separate cities they basically blend in together). You may live in PA but you can expect to spend your day to day in Mountain View, Redwood City, and probably Sunnyvale / Santa Clara / San Jose some too, collectively the South Bay.

Also having lived in the Bay Area for 11 years and San Diego for 2, I will tell you that culturally they are very different.  The Bay is professional and artsy and liberal and ""big city"".  San Diego is small and conservative and beachy and, outside of La Jolla, not a super think-y or career-y city.  So I'd ask yourself what culture you want to be immersed in more than anything else.",t2_3gw07,brownjava,0,1640981031.0,0,t1_hqpz1le,hqpz1le,True,[deleted],t3_rsdr87,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/rsdr87/29f_with_option_of_moving_to_palo_alto_music/,"29F with option of moving to Palo Alto.

The Peninsula is pretty sleepy as it's not really geared for young singles at all and Caltrain's offpeak/weekend frequency makes bouncing around it difficult.  Most people on the Peninsula have a car--something you might not be able to afford your first couple years at least so meeting up might be difficult.  

Some of those towns like RWC and MV have some advantages--RWC has a very nice theater with Broadway By the Bay, MV has great international food, California Avenue is University Avenue's scrappy little brother so generally more affordable, but these are still extremely expensive suburban towns.  Obviously RWC is going to be cheaper than PA but not enough to justify what it offers.  You're going to struggle to even find places that have live music, Palo Alto's last dive bar closed in 2020, it's all pretty bleak there.",t2_303fn,combuchan,0,1640952372.0,0,t1_hqo8xp0,hqo8xp0,True,[deleted],t3_rsdr87,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/rsdr87/29f_with_option_of_moving_to_palo_alto_music/,"29F with option of moving to Palo Alto.

"Second this. Lived in Mountain View by the Caltrain for 5 years. The accessibility was awesome, and when looking for jobs it made potential commutes so much better.

In general, I'm not so sure if you'll find the scene you're looking for in the greater Palo Alto  area, but MV did have some nice things going for it. Red Rock before the pandemic had regular open mics, there's a salsa dancing club.

By far the biggest way to meet people and get out is by doing athletic stuff outdoors. Run clubs, biking, hiking... it's all there, and a great way to socialize and spend down time. Not sure what your current weather is like, but sunny run in shorts in January was a massive game changer for me.

As far as dating, I think in the Stanford area there probably are a lot of people with broad cultural interests, there are just so many people coming and going from all over the world. I've been married this whole time so can't speak to it fully, but that dating scene looks promising from the outside.

"Putting my thoughts in case others are curious, even though this has been answered

It's nice. If you have a small place, you can use something like a portable A/C (not very efficient), but watch out for your electrical circuits. I use a portable A/C since I don't want to modify the building, but they use a lot of electricity. It's so easy to trip a circuit. 

The temperature has been in the 90s-100F in the past years. I think it's more of if you work at home a lot, you'd want something in the summer. Some years, we get bad heat waves that have been happening more often. Otherwise, the worst of the heat is probably when you are at the office

It's nice to have a credit union so that they might actually care about you. It's also nice to have one big, national bank so that you can count on having a branch in any city that you travel/move to (I use Chase for this, but that's not so much about liking Chase as much as it is about *really disliking the other options*).

There's a third requirement I have that can sometimes be met by a credit union, otherwise you might want to use one of those online-only banks (e.g. Ally): having an debit card that can be used at any out-of-network ATM which will (1) not charge fees and (2) refund fees charged by the bank that owns the ATM.",t2_3h7nq,lolwutpear,0,1639860238.0,0,t1_hp37g6s,hp37g6s,False,RossJD,t3_rj5pq7,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/rj5pq7/as_an_international_student_in_bay_area_which/,"As an international student in Bay Area, which bank should I choose: Bank of America, the West, Chase, Wells Fargo, Bank, San Jose Credit Union-CEFCU San Jose?",/r/siliconvalley/comments/rj5pq7/as_an_international_student_in_bay_area_which/hp37g6s/,4,r/siliconvalley,0,4

"No worries.  You can absolutely get a job in the corporate sector with a degree in economics.  To be honest, the truth is that having any degree is more important than having a specific degree if you want to get a job in a big company.  Get good grades, build a good network, and find opportunities to get some experience before graduating and you'll be on a great track for success.

Now, if you are interested in the tech sector and bringing that economics experience to bear, there are a few options that I can speak to directly:

1. Every big company has a finance department responsible for tracking spending and revenue.  Economics w/ a focus on finance or accounting will serve you well here.  You'll start in a pretty junior role but this is a really important department and there will be opportunities for advancement and to have a big impact.
2. Get a little bit of experience w/ data science as part of your undergrad and work on financial modeling for the company.  Huge problem at tech companies, where spend is often out of control, the cost model for delivering services to their customers often is out of whack, and a myriad of other problems where spend isn't tracked well and there are places to reduce the operational overhead of the business using data and data science tools.
3. Product Management is a broad discipline and people of all backgrounds can find roles as a PM.  Having an economics background will only be useful for thinking about product development, integrating customer feedback, and tracking development and product roadmaps.

Honestly, if you are a freshman the best advice I have for you is to focus yourself entirely on the idea that right now you are a professional student, and you want to work at being the best you can be at it.  You've got 3 - 4 years to set yourself up to do literally anything you want in the future.  My best friend from undergrad was also a CS major and decided to go to medical school after getting his degree.  Our university let him do a special second-degree that was just crafted around prepping for med school and he eventually got accepted and is now a doctor.  But that came on the back of him being a really great student as an undergrad.  Pick something you are interested in to motivate you to keep working at it, but also don't worry about how that applies in the ""real world"".  Things get pretty flexible after you graduate.",t2_cwxmi,trilobyte-dev,0,1639682500.0,0,t1_hotfzd3,hotfzd3,False,Think-Artist-3495,t3_qlbbsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/qlbbsg/is_an_economics_degree_valuable_to_work_in_tech/,Is an economics degree valuable to work in tech?,/r/siliconvalley/comments/qlbbsg/is_an_economics_degree_valuable_to_work_in_tech/hotfzd3/,1,r/siliconvalley,0,1

"There is a seed of insight here, but don't discount the business casual approach. The exact match depends highly on the culture of the VC firm you are working with, and their clientele. You don't want to over dress, but you don't want anything considered sloppy. Try beginning with a casual take on a pant suit or skirt suit. As D4rkR4in mentions, look at the VC characters in Silicon Valley.

Clean shirt with collar, or business appropriate blouse, turtle, or similar, depending on the mood you are looking to convey. Showing a little skin works, but keep it professional.

Jacket, sweater or vest. Worn in but clean and sharp. Mismatched suit coat works well. Wear what you're comfortable in.

Clean, pressed slacks, jeans or skirt (knee length to just longer than a mini)

Comfortable but clean shoes. Think sporty oxfords, boots or low heels, covered toes. Nothing slouchy, but nothing brand new. Even a smart pair of tennis shoes can work if well maintained, if it completes the look.

My apartment would heat up to the high 90s inside while I was at work sometimes, and it would be miserably hot for hours at night even once I put the AC on. Summer 2020, it was miserable when I had go work from home during that, even with a portable air conditioner (my windows opened horizontally, so I couldn't even get a normal window unit).

"Yes, air-conditioning is 100% necessary IMO. Especially during these work-from-home times. It doesn't need to be central AC though.

You can definitely get by with window units, or with the free-standing portable kind if window units don't work for your space.

So if you find a great place with no AC, you can just budget in the cost of a couple of window units. We had one small unit in each bedroom, and one larger portable unit for the living-room/dining room.

The one gotcha is that your energy bills will be high.

"I grew up with central air being from AZ. It wasn’t anything I thought about when renting a place because it was standard. Here in the Bay Area, depending on what type of place you live in, your sun exposure, etc, you may be ok with a window unit in each of your rooms with an air purifier to two through the rental to take into account smoke from wildfires. 

I live in a single family home built in the 50s, and it has very little insulation and lots of single pane windows.  Our first summer in our rental was last year, working from home, no AC, 90+ degree days, and we couldn’t open the windows because of the terrible AQ from fires in the Santa Cruz Mountains. 

It. Was. Horrible. even after the smoke subsided and the fires were put out, we could not get any relief in our place. Window units didn’t work for our casement windows.  We ended up talking to our landlord about it, and they ultimately put in mini split systems in each room, which was not a cheap expense (I think it was over $25k).  We were lucky they opted for that expense (we were not the first tenants to complain about the climate control issue, just the first ones that didn’t complain after giving move out notice). 

Anyway, most of the year, central air isn’t necessary, but you will be VERY grateful you have air conditioning of any kind when you do need it.",t2_l8423,jlmcdon2,0,1638777267.0,0,t1_hnfp4pi,hnfp4pi,True,campwalden98,t3_r9wtif,https://www.reddit.com/r/siliconvalley/comments/r9wtif/help_is_having_central_ac_actually_necessary/,Help!

"With the rising number of wildfires, I'd say AC is a must-have now, but that could come from portable AC or central AC.

"Most homes in the bay do not have ac. Is it nice? Sure. 

This summer there were probably 4 nights that I wish we would have had ac. Last year there were 10 days.

We insulated the attic this year and it made a huge difference keeping the upstairs tolerable even on the hottest days.
