"Social security is supposed to be a safety net, not something you 'cash in on'.  You are not supposed to be able to retire on it. It is meant to stop grandma from dieing of malnutrition/ becoming homeless. Changing it into a personal investment is a bad idea because people are stupid and will invest badly, lose it all, and then you get a bunch of dead or homeless grandmas again.  Most people in the US are not financial advisors and asking them to compete against the 1% fund managers in NY is a losing idea.  Think of it as forced diversification from your 401k.  Even if your 401k goes to zero, you always have social security to fall back onto.

Social security can be funded to keep it afloat just like we sunk 10 trillion into unneeded wars this decade.

"After my car was in their parking garage for awhile, I found out an unknown liquid dripped on my car’s back window from the ceiling. They informed me and apologized, but it won’t come off my car. 

The parking garage’s door also remained broke for a month; their solution was to leave it open so people living here could enter, however that meant anyone could walk inside our building.

The Parker is not connected to the skywalk. If you decide to get groceries at HyVee downtown, you will battle the elements. I’ve had my feet soaked from rain because I couldn’t just walk in the skywalk.

The shitty fire alarms. Currently, the fire alarms are disabled and they have not told us if they turned them back on. Why? Because they kept going off. One day in January they went off SIX times alone. The fire fighters got annoyed and just slowly walked in the last time I saw them. Kind of dangerous IMO.

"This in turn is a huge part of the disconnect and problem with the current HyVee ecosystem. The store executives are suddenly emotional disinvested from caring about their staff. 

Their entire livelihood becomes let’s make the store money at all costs. They prevent full time hours to save on the benefits and now cut hours of part time employees when it’s convenient for the store due to weather or what time of the year it is. 
This causes them to lose good people who
migrate to better or more stable jobs. It’s literally becoming a thing where to the store manager the customer matters, but every employee is just a pawn in a price balancing bonanza. They even set their own prices, which leads to price gouging when the numbers aren’t on par. 

The customer service gets worse(people working multiple departments without pay raises) and the cost goes up(robbing Peter to pay Paul).

"I mean…
Not in hyvee, but i can guess:

Aisles online - probably the biggest project that is most likely moved into maintenance phase, 20-25 people, including mobile devs, testers etc;

Website - anywhere around 5-10 people depending if they have new stuff planned/in works;

Fuel saver/rewards - guessing around 10-15 people, integration engineers and such for partnerships, probably bunch of testers on different hardware, and some developers as well;

Self checkout - depends on what off the shelf solution they’re using, if this is their software, then it’s massive. If not (more likely), then couple of developers and somewhere 5-10 integration/sl3 support engineers and testers.

And then probably a shit ton of new projects that haven’t seen the light of day yet or are internal.

It’s entirely possible they hired a bunch of people, developed solutions for everything that they needed, projects went into maintenance/support and now they’re out of ideas what new projects to work on.

It’s natural for companies-not-in-software-development to go through similar situations, and that’s why vendor/supplier companies exist.

"Ok so I can sort of run it down but don’t have the right terminology I don’t think, maybe someone can help me out.

What most employees have in their retirement account are the lowest priority stocks, the kind that is the last to get paid if there’s a like a bankruptcy or something.  I was told to think about them more like bonds?  Employees can buy more in $50 chunks per pay period after 6 months if I remember right. They are tied to company performance but there’s nothing nifty like dividends or extra chocolate chips in your cookies.

“Staff” as we called them are people store director and above, and corporate management types. These people are literally paid in stock, and as long as the company does well and in the case of store directors their store does well, it can be very lucrative.  It’s probably more complicated than I was told, but it’s like they literally set their own salary by selling a portion of their annual stock allocation.  This also means that a store director that doesn’t turn a profit might be stuck eating dog food. 

Store directors when I worked there had high turnover because it’s kinda high risk high gain, and they’d literally get to a point where they couldn’t make a living, so a new hotshot would step in and the cycle would start over.  I think this was a big motivation behind consolidating store management a couple years ago, because of the churn and a way to reduce risk by putting a director in front of a mix of stores.",t2_4wdaj,lovespunstoomuch,0,1648915749.0,0,t1_i34dopt,i34dopt,False,eastsider_dude,t3_tufvbq,https://www.reddit.com/r/desmoines/comments/tufvbq/getting_a_4year_college_degree_so_you_can_bag/,Getting a 4-year college degree so you can bag groceries at Hy-Vee,/r/desmoines/comments/tufvbq/getting_a_4year_college_degree_so_you_can_bag/i34dopt/,15,r/desmoines,0,15

Positives:. Basic cable, internet, heat, water, etc all included in the price.  Only thing you pay for is electric.  Good central location.  Safe area.  Plenty of playgrounds and swim pools.  Non-smoking buildings.

Negatives: Window unit AC.  Works ok, but is loud.  Next to 80/35 so you get traffic noise.  Some units could use an update.  The older buildings don't have great sound insulation, you can hear your neighbor walking above.

Exactly. You don't give a shit if something is true or not. You are no different from Trump's followers.

Tyson and Trump are flip sides of the same coin: a culture that values celebrity and entertainment more than truth.

"I’ll add to that, as we go every weekend for the last 7 years or so. 

Someone correctly pointed out that kinds under 10 (double check the sign) aren’t technically allowed in. I don’t think anyone would give you too much trouble, but good to follow rules. 

As someone else pointed out, I think your best bet is to hang out outside the park and ask folks as they’re coming and going if they’d mind. Most won’t. 

There’s also a playground nearby along the walking path that kids play on all the time. Plus a beach to throw rocks in the water (too cold to swim!)

All in all, I think if you went down there and kind of observed and also checked out the playground, there’s a pretty good chance you’ll run into folks with a doggo.

"I have written Tyson at The American Museum of Natural and also contacted StarTalk. I participate in Tyson's Twitter and YouTube threads. He knows about his errors but has failed to make any effort to correct most of them.

Tyson will not admit to an error unless it is getting a lot of attention. It took a lot arm twisting to get Neil to admit his accusations against President Bush were false. Check out  [this piece from The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/09/27/neil-degrasse-tyson-admits-he-botched-bush-quote/). 

Tyson had Bush fanning the flames of anger and hatred after 9-11 by bragging that his God was the God who named the stars so as to set Christians above Muslims. When [Bush's actual 9-11 speech](http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010917-11.html) was a call for tolerance and inclusion. It was delivered from a mosque.

If you read the Washington Post article you will notice Tyson initially tried to weasel out of admitting his vile accusations were false. He only apologized to Bush after the story started trending.

Tyson still hasn't admitted his false histories regarding Isaac Newton, Copernicus and Hamid Al Ghazali. He has made zero effort to correct the misinformation he has spread. He has no regard for truth.

"I saw your comments about being hesitant about dog parks, but hear me out. Raccoon River in WDM has an amazing park. There is a dog park split into 3 spaces. There are two large dog areas which are conjoined, and then also a small dog area. Now admittedly the small dog area isn’t usually too busy, BUT, I have taken both of my dogs to this park many, many times and have never had a bad experience, even when there have been days where there are probably 100 dogs running around in there. People are very attentive and park security has ramped up in the last year to check tags and make sure things are safe and OK with all the animals. And if you’re nervous about how many are around or the uncontrolled part of an open park, rather than taking your daughter in, there are benches very close that you could sit at and observe, and maybe ask people if she can pet as they come or leave. I can basically promise you that anyone you meet will be more than happy to let her meet their pups.

"I'm basically a professional findom who gets paid to come in a demean an organization, criticize their performance, and demand compliance. 

I do PCI, HITRUST, SOC, NIST, CMMC and other technical compliance audits. But my background is in molecular biology and a master horticulturalist for dispensaries in Colorado.

My job gives me a lot of contact with different businesses across the country since I am basically doing a consulting sort of gig in sense (my firm is hired to consult other companies I guess). That has allowed me to talk to people at different levels of orgs in many different sectors of business, and the story is generally the same. The good companies realize that everything is different and WFH is here to stay. They see the improved productivity and worker satisfaction - workers see more of their cats and families and spend less time on the road and in gas. It's a win win. 

Any job that has been able to be done WFH for the last year can be done across state lines. And the employers who are on the right side of this tidal shift know that. And they are hiring.

The companies I talk to all have their staff working remotely and no desire to change. There may be a dinosaur or two I suppose. But they also have deeper problems in addition to their shitty HR policies and antiquated concepts of ""the office"".

I think that I am just trying to say that my job function doesn't feel like it is unique during this time period. Fundamentally, the message is the same - no matter what your job is, if you were able to WFH for the last year without the sky falling, you can absolutely expect you can continue doing so in perpetuity. As long as you expand your job horizons to the entire US.

When you expand your horizons to the entire US you can also earn West/East coast wages while enjoying Midwest cost of living.

"I have never read anything so wrong in my life. 

There are plenty of roles that are particularly well suited for WFH, and zero evidence to support your assertion that it is “harder to climb the ladder”. 

The worker pool isn’t “larger”. It’s not like the total number of workers magically increased. There are potentially more applicants for any specific job, yes, but the total number of jobs hasn’t decreased, while frankly the total number of workers has. Also, the converse is true — any given worker has more choices when trying to find an employer, increasing competition for labor. What we _might_ actually see out of this is a little more pay _equity_, with the lowest earners earning more and the highest earning less — something that would frankly be a boon for the economy. 

Recession is going to come anyway. The chances of WFH directly contributing in any significant way to that are smaller than none.  WFH workers are almost universally happier. Happy workers are more productive. Good for business, good for the economy, good for mental health. 

The only things going against WFH right now are the inner-city support businesses that are going to suffer, and the big banks that are going to lose on their investments in urban center real estate. But, change is inevitable, and if your business can’t adapt to change, then it deserves to go under. We’re actually pretty lucky in this regard — COVID has been a forcing function here, and a lot of this damage has already been done, so the short-term pain isn’t going to be that bad. 

No, the only ones truly against WFH are the ultra-rich that stand to lose out on their urban-center bets. Unfortunately, the propaganda machine has already started in this regard, not at all helped by the President and his backwards-looking rhetoric. Frankly, going to the office is just like car dealerships: it’s a legacy way of doing things that is going to hang on well past its time due to an entrenched minority with money, even though it’s abundantly clear the new way is better in all regards except for those specific people.

"I genuinely don’t understand what is so difficult to understand. Why do you think service at the DMV differs from that of say a bank branch? One does not have competition, and the workers have virtually zero chance of job loss, and zero chance of being put out of business. There are no alternatives to the DMV. The other, operates in a competitive market, where if customers are unsatisfied or traffic slows to a point of no longer being profitable, will lose their jobs.

"I've worked at 3 Fortune 500 Companies, one of them having 250K employees, and then one start-up. Each time I moved, I thought: I'm going to make a difference here, the company cares about me, climb the ladder, etc.  Although I have increased my salary year over year, I have learned more and more one simple truth: Your company doesn't care about you. It may seem like it, and you may feel it, they may even say it and give you a great set of benefits, but it simply is not true. You're replaceable and disposable. 

I don't see this as demoralizing or depressing, instead I gain motivation. I work hard enough to derive success, I make moves to better my career when it makes sense for my life wholistically, and I don't overwork myself chasing some ethereal ""love"" or ""purpose"" bestowed upon me. Take breaks when you need to, stand up for your mental health, impact and better the lives immediately around you, build community, do something you love outside of work, and leave a company if it's making you truly unhappy. With all that being said I love my current company of less than 500 people and believe they do care. Hopeless romantic I guess.
