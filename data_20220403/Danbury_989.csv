"Savings Bank of Danbury today announced plans for constructing a new, 35,000-square-foot office building at the corner of Main and White Streets in Danbury.  
A rendering of the bank’s new building in Danbury.  
The new edifice will house the bank’s non-branch back-office operations team. Savings Bank of Danbury will continue to use its location at 220 Main St. in Danbury as its headquarters.  
Savings Bank of Danbury CEO Martin G. Morgado has been working Danbury and its mayor, Joe Cavo, for some time to advance the construction initiative. The proposed location would be situated on two adjacent properties owned by the YMCA and the city of Danbury, respectively.  
Morgado said the new location “will enable us to consolidate our non-branch back-office operations and provide dynamic meeting space and operations facilities. As the oldest continuously operating business in the city of Danbury, with a history dating back to 1849, we are so pleased that we found the right location.”  
The last significant building project in Danbury for the bank was in 1999 with the construction of its 35 West St. location. At that time, the bank had 65 employees and $362 million in assets.  Today, Savings Bank of Danbury has over 200 employees and $1.4 billion in assets.  
The bank is also expanding its presence further in Fairfield County with plans to open a location in Norwalk later this fall.  
Cavo predicted the plan will “lead to additional employment opportunities and daily foot traffic, fueling the ongoing economic revitalization of downtown. The building would be located on the corner of Main Street and White Street with excellent visibility, creating an impressive gateway to downtown Danbury.”  
The YMCA had previously used the site for its Escape to the Arts operation. The adjacent lot, once known as the Tuxedo Junction building and which has been vacant since 2015, was purchased by the city in 2017.",t2_9rsh98m8,AlbertCashmus,0,1636121744.0,0,t1_hjf18po,hjf18po,True,AlbertCashmus,t3_qnc2sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Danbury/comments/qnc2sw/savings_bank_of_danbury_constructing_35000_sf/,"Savings Bank of Danbury constructing 35,000 SF office building on Main Street",/r/Danbury/comments/qnc2sw/savings_bank_of_danbury_constructing_35000_sf/hjf18po/,2,r/Danbury,0,2

"DANBURY — A developer has proposed a 425,000-square-foot “lifestyle center” with apartments, retail, assisted living and office space on more than 30 acres off Mill Plain Road.  
The project, announced Friday by Westconn Park LLC Development, would be adjacent to Western Connecticut State University’s Westside campus and is subject to the city’s approval. Plans were submitted this week.  
“It’s a place where you live, work, play and educate,” said Albert Salame, who has owned the 32-acre property for 20 years.  
The property won’t have a school, but it will have 200,000 square feet of housing units, 80,000 square feet for an assisted living facility, and 50,000 square feet for a corporate building, three pad sites and mixed-use retail.  
Medical offices, corporate training facilities and retail would fill the 100,000-plus additional square footage, along with a 3.4 acre recreational area, clubhouse, pool and tennis courts.  
Developers have already found tenants for 330,000 square feet of the space, Salame said. This includes his Salame Companies, the Morganti Group Inc, an international construction firm based locally, and Griffin Living, which would operate the assisted living facility.  
It’s a good time for the project with the city’s population growing, especially as New Yorkers move to Danbury, Salame said.  
“Everything is coming together very well,” he said.  
If approved, the project would be another addition to the city’s booming west side.  
Developers of the Summit, a 1.2 million-square-foot facility at the former Matrix building, are creating a similar live-work-play concept.  
The west side includes the about 550-acre residential subdivision known as the Reserve, where thousands of condos and apartments, as well as thousands of square feet of commercial space, have been built or approved. One project recently approved there is the $36 million rehabilitation hospital, Encompass Health.  
On Wooster Heights road, the city has approved an $80 million proton therapy center, Danbury Proton. Down the street is a new assisted living facility, Keystone Place at Wooster Heights.  
Construction on the first phase of the “lifestyle center” could begin as soon as the spring, with the full development hopefully completed in three years, Salame said.  
“Once the snow goes away, we’ll be ready to move there, subject to our having the site plan approved,” he said.  
The developers have been working with the city on the project for years, so he doesn’t anticipate issues.  
“It took some time to get to this point frankly, but we’re happy because every time we tweak it it seems to get a little better,” Salame said.  
Developers plan to build 200 apartments, he said. Most will be one- or two- bedrooms, but some are studios and three-bedrooms.  
He’s not anticipating families with school children to move in. City and school officials have been concerned with overcrowding in Danbury schools.  
“We think at this point we’re going to have a larger amount of empty-nesters,” Salame said.  
Tenants could benefit from the proposed reopening of the Maybrook train line, which would create a faster ride from Danbury to New York City, he said.  
Developers plan to create a foot path to WestConn’s campus, where the Visual and Performing Arts Center sits, which “makes us convenient and attractive,” Salame said.",t2_9rsh98m8,AlbertCashmus,0,1635881625.0,0,t1_hj1tit3,hj1tit3,True,AlbertCashmus,t3_qla461,https://www.reddit.com/r/Danbury/comments/qla461/lifestyle_center_with_housing_commercial_space/,"'Lifestyle center' with housing, commercial space proposed on 30 acres of Danbury's west side",/r/Danbury/comments/qla461/lifestyle_center_with_housing_commercial_space/hj1tit3/,3,r/Danbury,0,3

"26F from Danbury born and raised.. there are no terrible parts of Danbury at all relatively speaking. I have always felt comfortable being in any part of town any time of day or night with no more or less issue than anywhere else in newtown, bethel, new Fairfield, new Milford.. don’t be gullible, don’t look for a problem, mind your own business, and you’re safe. Lock your car because it’s the smart thing not because the area is questionable. Try not to compartmentalize it’s residents by their appearance or ethnicity because you’ll only be making sure you are maintaining the idea that you have something to fear and someone who is different to watch out for. Danbury is great. My grandfather was director of one of the homeless shelters and I’ve spent plenty of time with our homeless folks in the city while volunteering.

"Did not get that letter.

Do you have an older neighbor with a label maker? 

Years ago, I heard my mother’s business answering machine kick in. I ignored it until the second message came in (same voice). I didn’t get there in time to answer but found two messages from a gentleman with an older voice who was looking for Detective So-and-so. Nothing about the answering machine message should have made him think he had reached the police department. TWICE. The voice sounded older. The complaint was rambling about a neighbor. I swear it included lining something in foil and neighbors coming into his house and doing things.   
  
We were in the middle of a major weather something. I can’t remember if it was a heatwave or snowstorm, but something unpleasant was happening. I was a bit worried about the guy.   
  
I called the Danbury Police and explained the call/message. When I got to the Detective’s name, I was informed that no such Detective ever worked for Danbury… wait a minute, there was a Detective by that name in Bethel.   
  
I call the Bethel Police and I explain why Danbury sent me to them. I think Detective so-and-so had retired. I explain the gentleman sounded old, the message about what his neighbors were doing to him, etc., and the Sergeant who answered the phone sighs and says “it’s AAAAAALL coming back to me now.”   
  
I vaguely remember the issue dealt with neighbors who blocked a zoning change decades ago. The Sergeant offered to send someone out to check on the gentleman (we had his name and phone number). I said yes. The officer who checked called me to let me know that the gentleman was fine and insulted that anyone thought he needed any help.

"OP was saying she or someone else would go yell at them, and she was also asking what worked and what didn't.  I used to live in a ""bad"" area of New Haven and would deal with this kind of stuff fairly regularly, and in my experience it's almost never dangerous to go talk to people.  What IS dangerous though is when instead of making a polite request or whatever you let your fear or anger escalate the situation into something bad.

Honestly it doesn't really matter if it's college kids or not, it's people, and people don't just randomly attack other people for approaching them for no reason the vast majority of the time.

OP was asking what worked and what didn't, my experience has been that polite requests usually work, getting angry and trying to intimidate can be dangerous.",t2_daidg,creativeatrophy,0,1633095721.0,0,t1_hez2y2u,hez2y2u,False,FireyToots,t3_pyymnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Danbury/comments/pyymnq/rant_about_safety/,Rant about Safety.,/r/Danbury/comments/pyymnq/rant_about_safety/hez2y2u/,2,r/Danbury,0,2

"[It is complicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/nxrl2r/chief_youtube_video_of_danbury_police_response_to/h1ophw6/). 

Generally speaking, i don't mind First Amendment Auditors in general. As long as they're polite and actually stick within the bounds of decency, it's a relatively non-intrusive and low conflict way to try and test the boundaries of constitutional law and advocate for change. That's a good thing. There's a common legal saying, ""bad facts make bad law"". Imagine the situation last summer with the protests, riots, and other activities. The news media were lawfully there covering the story; but it was a highly charged time, with everyone on edge and armed. That's not the time to refine the small minutia of the 1A. You want the rule of engagement laid down long before those kinds of events, so misunderstandings don't cause it to spiral out of control. So are most 1A auditors fighting over petty and small things, which don't seem worth it? Absolutely. But the point isn't what's going on when they do it. It is about establishing a precedent and educating people about the lines, so that when it does actually matter, the standard is clear. 

That being said, most 1A auditors don't know the law either and are confidently incorrect, loud, and abrasive in their responses. And when it gets results (either the police backing down, recognizing it's not worth the trouble, or cities settling bogus claims because it's cheaper to pay off a bad claim than actually litigate it), it emboldens them in their false belief, even when the facts are different (for instance, auditing inside a public building has an entirely different level of scrutiny associated it compared to doing it on the public streets outside the building, but auditors will use the same rules to argue both).",t2_kbsxl,jasperval,0,1623770997.0,0,t1_h1uvzpg,h1uvzpg,True,Bulky-Mark315,t3_o01tak,https://www.reddit.com/r/Danbury/comments/o01tak/a_youtuber_tried_to_audit_how_well_danbury/,A YouTuber tried to 'audit' how well Danbury follows Constitutional rights.

"> and cannot infringe on your constitutional rights.

It only infringes on your Constitutional rights if you subscribe to the surface level First Amendment Auditor belief that their reading and interpretations of the Constitution supersede that of the judiciary and the Supreme Court. They're so caught up in what they want the law to be, they read the plain text and say ""That's good enough for me"". That's fine if your goal is advocating change, but it's not what the law actually *is*. 

I've watched a lot of 1A auditor videos. They will often claim ""If I can be there legally and see with my eyes, I can record"", which sounds like a nice, pithy response. It's just not at all what the relevant case law says. If you want to see how the Supreme Court views it, look no further than visiting the public gallery during the midst of their oral arguments. The public is absolutely allowed to be there legally. Yet you won't see any cameras, even from the national press media. Why not, if the SC is a public building where people are allowed to be, which by the 1A logic means you can't restrict cameras? 

It's because every one of the Amendments has restrictions. The 1A doesn't cover obscenity. The 2A doesn't cover nukes. And the argument they're making most of the time doesn't hold up. 

Like any private landowner, the government may ""preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is lawfully dedicated."" *Sentinel Commc'ns Co. v. Watts*, 936 F.2d 1189, 1201 (11th Cir. 1991). Further, like any place of employment, a government workplace exists to accomplish the business of the employer.   *Cornelius*, 473 U.S. 788, 805. The government may, therefore, exercise its right to control access to its workplace to avoid interruptions to the performance of the duties of its employees. *Id.* at 805-06

1A auditors are generally correct that ""[t]he First Amendment protects the right to gather information about what public officials do on public property, and specifically, a right to record matters of public interest."" *Smith v. City of Cumming*, 212 F.3d 1332, 1333 (11th Cir. 2000). Like all First Amendment protections, this right is ""subject to reasonable time, manner and place restrictions,"" and the First Amendment does not automatically open property to the public just because it is owned by the government. *Id.*; *Bloedorn v. Grube*, 631 F.3d 1218, 1230 (11th Cir. 2011). The level of scrutiny that a court will apply to a government's restriction on the public's access (including photography and video recording) to a public property depends on the forum where the restrictions are applied.

In determining whether the First Amendment protects particular speech on government property, we must first examine the nature of the forum in which the speaker's speech is restricted. Forums may be public, either by tradition or by designation, or nonpublic. The category of the forum determines the appropriate test for weighing ""the Government's interest in limiting the use of its property to its intended purpose [against] the interest of those wishing to use the property for other purposes."" *Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Educ. Fund*, 473 U.S. 788 (1985).

""Publicly owned or operated property does not become a ""public forum"" simply because members of the public are permitted to come and go at will. Although whether the property has been generally opened to the public is a factor to consider in determining whether the government has opened its property to the use of the people for communicative purposes, it is not determinative of the question."" *Grace*, 461 U.S. at 177. 

In a forum that is not for either reason public, governmental restrictions on expressive conduct or speech are constitutional so long as they are reasonable in light of the use to which the forum is dedicated and ""are not an effort to suppress expression merely because public officials oppose the speaker's view."" *Cornelius*, 473 U.S. at 800. 

It's important to note that most 1A Auditors place emphasis on doing these things in ""public lobbies"" or ""where the public can access"". While those elements may be relevant in a pure trespassing context (person in a restricted area is trespassing even if not engaged in expressive conduct), a municipal building public lobby is still considered a non-public fora for 1A expression purposes. (*See  Sammartano v. First Judicial Dist. Court*, 303 F.3d 959, 966 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that judicial and municipal complexes are nonpublic forums) and *Sefick v. Gardner(, 164 F.3d 370, 372 (7th Cir. 1998) (""The lobby of the [federal] courthouse is not a traditional public forum or a designated public forum, not a place open to the public for the presentation of views. No one can hold a political rally in the lobby of a federal courthouse. It is a nonpublic forum"".)

In this case, the internal areas of the Danbury library are classified as ""non-public fora"". *See*, *Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Loc. Educators' Ass'n*, 460 U.S. 37, 46 (1983) (defining a nonpublic forum as public property that is not open to the public for First Amendment activity in the same way as are streets or parks). Thus, any restriction on public access to these buildings need only be ""viewpoint neutral and reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum."" *Davenport v. Wash. Educ. Ass'n*, 551 U.S. 177, 189 (2007); see also *Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Def. & Fund, Inc.*, 473 U.S. 788, 799-800 (1985). ""It is a long-settled principle that governmental actions are subject to a lower level of First Amendment scrutiny when 'the governmental function operating ... [is] not the power to regulate or license, as lawmaker, ... but, rather, as proprietor, to manage [its] internal operation[s]....""' *U.S. v. Kokinda*, 497 U.S. 720, 725 (1990). 

So the government is absolutely allowed to restrict 1A activities (including speech, assembly, and recording) while within government buildings that are a non-public fora, even when held open to the public for certain hours of the day.  So the big question is: What are the limitations on the restriction? 

First, the restriction must be reasonable under the circumstances. Second, the restriction on speech or activities must be ""content-neutral"". A uniform policy of preventing all recordings is *more* enforcible than a policy that you selectively only apply to jerks or those that criticize the government. 

There haven't been many cases of 1A auditors which have made it up to higher courts, because they tend to settle for nuisance values. The most prominent comes from the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, who addressed this issue in the case of *Commonwealth v. Bradley*, 232 A.3d 747 (Pa. 2020). There, a ""first amendment auditor"" attempted to video the interior of a police department waiting area. A law enforcement officer instructed the individual to cease recording and directed his attention to a no-filming sign conspicuously posted in the lobby. The individual refused to cease recording. Law enforcement arrested the individual and charged him with trespass. A jury convicted, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court affirmed. *Id.* at 762. In affirming the trespass conviction, the Bradley opinion stressed that the filming prohibition was reasonable because it ""prevent[ed] the disclosure of confidential information"" and ""preserv[ed] the privacy of victims."" *Id.* at 755.

In addition to reasonable and viewpoint-neutral restrictions on visitors, government buildings are absolutely permitted to direct those who refuse to abide by the restrictions to leave the property. Failure to leave the property after being directed to do so may constitute a trespass; although there is some variability amongst different states about who specifically has the authority to trespass an individual from public land, and the process to do so. Generally speaking though, you absolutely can be trespassed from a government building; however there are due process concerns when the trespass order is indefinite, lacks notice or opportunity to be heard, or interferes with procedural or substantive requirements.

There isn't a requirement for a formal written trespass warning, or for the trespass warning to come from a police officer. After the staffer told him to leave, and he refused, he was trespassing. However, the staffer isn't privileged to use force to eject him, and the police have their own procedures. Further, to be liable for arrest for criminal trespass, the officer must witness the offense, since they cannot conduct warrantless arrests for a misdemeanor not performed in their presence. So generally the 1A auditors wait for the police to come before leaving. But that doesn't mean they weren't trespassing beforehand, and the staffer could go to a magistrate and swear out a criminal complaint and seek a misdemeanor arrest warrant if they think they could get it, even if the police didn't come.

"Hmm ngl I think that’s a strange perception. The LGBTQ+ community as I understand it is a group of like-minded people of varying gender identities and sexual orientations coming together to promote their rights and enable normalizing. 

I don’t think anyone sees anyone in the community as a “letter” unless you’re a person on the right, maybe? It seems strange to me to want to divide people that are cooperating? Like you don’t want help from or to associate with Trans people? Because they aren’t just “queer”. Hell, I’m straight, but I’m “queer” if you take my meaning. So even the whole word is subjective in meaning. 

Lumping the diverse people in the community into “queer” I think is a bigger disservice than leaving it as is where all identities can feel included.",t2_al2g4nuj,DildoBarnabus,0,1623157674.0,0,t1_h10vpqu,h10vpqu,False,Bulky-Mark315,t3_nv1wd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Danbury/comments/nv1wd0/danbury_to_host_lgbtq_celebratory_music_festival/,Danbury to host LGBTQ+ celebratory music festival in June,/r/Danbury/comments/nv1wd0/danbury_to_host_lgbtq_celebratory_music_festival/h10vpqu/,4,r/Danbury,0,4

Yes, the news game has shifted in the last 20 years, but I don't think it's financially unviable as these publications prove. NYT is in a great situation by finding great leadership that cut down costs, leaned into what was working and found their voice.

Local news is another beast, but I think solutions are out there. It really comes down to having good leadership and forward thinking owners leading these companies. Trim costs as much as possible, get distribution through channels you own like email or even texting (crazy, but I'd try it) and like any business create a product people can't live without.

"Yeah, some solid options for sure. Best Korean food I’ve had in CT, aside from Dr Jung’s cart in New Haven, has been Edo 2 in Danbury. Also, best BBQ in state is on Danbury/Ridgefield line, Hoodoo Brown. There’s even really solid sushi, which the area NEVER had, at Ki. 

Again, food scene is dramatically better than it was 10 years ago, when it was pretty bleak. Pizza game just still isn’t strong. I find Stanziato’s ridiculously overrated. Crust is not great which is the hallmark of great New Haven pizza. Anyone can do fancy toppings.

The area just needs a bit better Mexican and Thai IMO. Pancho’s is OK and Broken Symmetry/Grunion has good burrito type food.
