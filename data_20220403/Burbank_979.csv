"Welcome! In terms of climbing gyms you have a few options...

1. Veridgo Boulders – Smallest of the Touchstone facilities in LA. It crowds up during weekday nights and/or whenever a new set drops. 
2. LA Boulders/Hollywood Boulders/Cliffs of Id – The other Touchstone gyms in LA proper. Parking for every one of them is rough so just be mindful of that. Cliffs is the only one with top-roping available. Hollywood Boulders is a massive facility. You'll never get bored there.
3. Top Out Climbing – This place is the tits. It doesn't boast the pretentious vibe I feel at Touchstone. I live two blocks away from Verdigo and I gladly hop into my car to drive the 30 minutes to go to Top Out. Their boulders are more harshly graded than Touchstone. They have 6 (7?) auto-belay walls with problems ranging from 5.5 to 12d. It's a fun, community-driven gym with all the good vibes you can handle. Weekends fills up with families, birthdays parties and kids running wild under the ropes so I tend to avoid climbing on those days.
4. Other gyms worth checking out in and around LA – Boulderdash (multiple locations in deep SFV), Hangar 18 (only been to the one in Arcadia, it was super small but works in a pinch), Stronghold (more popular with top ropers but has a decent bouldering wall, too).",t2_y5ou8,booradleysboo,0,1648829133.0,0,t1_i2zy7nd,i2zy7nd,True,poopslayer1969,t3_ttt205,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/ttt205/best_climbing_gyms/,Best climbing gyms,/r/burbank/comments/ttt205/best_climbing_gyms/i2zy7nd/,7,r/burbank,0,7

"I had the same thing. The contractor I worked with to put in a sump pump said sometimes instead of actual drainage, they would just dig a big pit and fill it with gravel. During a rain storm, it will fill up and then slowly disperse into the ground. It has enough room to accommodate the rain from most rain storms, but sometimes it doesn’t, or it settles and gets filled in with other stuff so it doesn’t work as well. 

If this happens once every couple of years, you can probably get away with a handheld pump and tube to the street. When it fills up, you gotta go outside and pump the water out. If this happens more than that, a sump pump is your best bet. I was a bit concerned that it was overly complicated for the occasional pooling/flooding, but it is actually pretty simple. Long term, you’ll also save your house from water damage.",t2_654ym93r,GoneWithTheBank,0,1648527794.0,0,t1_i2iyh3j,i2iyh3j,False,darwinDMG08,t3_tqgs94,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/tqgs94/drainage_does_anyone_have_a_storm_drain_that/,"Drainage — does anyone have a storm drain that actually goes to the street?

"It looks like a concrete container for a sump pump. At first I thought it might be connected to an area drain, which is usually a 3"" or 4"" line that goes to the curb. Is there any plumbing line at the curb area?

A plumbing contractor that also does drain cleaning (in case there is an area/outdoor drain that is clogged up with roots and leaves, etc.) is your best bet. I don't know any personally, but judging by the amount of water, you'll need either an area drain (or two) at the low points ($$$), or put in a sump pump with external plumbing to the curb or connect it to your sewer line (generally in front). Which, in Burbank, the external plumbing might not even be allowed.

"Nah, there is a lawsuit going on by NIMBY's, lol.  

&#x200B;

After council members said they could not prevent the restaurant from developing the site, some neighbors turned to the courts, suing Raising Cane’s in June. Save Rancho Providencia Neighborhood, which purports to represent the community, has argued that Raising Cane’s needed to receive special permission from the city to construct a drive-thru, though the city has disputed this. A Los Angeles Superior Court judge also decided last year against issuing a ruling that would prevent the restaurant from opening during the legal proceedings.  
  
In a hearing on March 9, Superior Court Judge Mitchell Beckloff said he would take both parties’ arguments “under submission.” The court also canceled a March 11 hearing on Save Rancho Providencia Neighborhood’s arguments, though filed documents indicated it would be rescheduled.  
  
Pasquale previously told the Leader that the lawsuit affected Raising Cane’s opening date, but did not immediately respond to a question this week regarding whether the ongoing litigation prompted the most recent delay.",t2_i2e7i,javierm27,0,1647967929.0,0,t1_i1ojs7q,i1ojs7q,False,halfkjourno,t3_tk5ulb,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/tk5ulb/raising_canes_will_now_reportedly_open_sometime/,"Raising Cane’s will now reportedly open ""sometime this spring""",/r/burbank/comments/tk5ulb/raising_canes_will_now_reportedly_open_sometime/i1ojs7q/,20,r/burbank,0,20

"I know this was posted 52 days ago. I graduated from BHS in 2020 I have lived in Burbank all my life and was born here. I’ve been to Miller Elementary, Bret Harte Elementary, John Muir middle school, and Burbank high school. From personal experience, John Muir was not the best time for me. I remember I was bullied for being Asian/not best looking. Once I got into high school everything changed, I noticed people were a lot nicer to me once I got prettier. High school felt very superficial but I had a lot of fun. Mainly the environment can get toxic for some people. Many students I have talked to can agree with that. I loved all my teachers in high school. I learned so much and I wouldn’t change anything. Overall my hs experience was amazing besides no graduation or prom.

"To be clear, whether or not “they care” it is a federally regulated flight even if you are flying between two states where it’s legal it is federally illegal, and the medical card only works in your state of residency, crossing states with a federally illegal drug is a big crime. Also regardless of if it’s legal in both states, the product is only legal in its state it was sold/purchased that’s why on the container it has a state label so hypothetically if you were pulled over in Vegas and had CA weed with the CA label on it that’s a crime and again now you’ve crossed state lines with a drug which isn’t good, even tho they probably won’t/don’t care. Drug dogs can smell marijuana even if it’s a vape/pen. Also remember your not supposed to fly with batteries so if you carry it on and don’t take it out of your bag for X-ray the battery might trigger them to search your bag so maybe check the battery part? Then if you get caught with just the cartridge you won’t have to trash the pen too, ans you can just say you forgot to take it out I guess…If your going to do it  edibles seem low risk, they aren’t going to test your gummies or chocolate in an unlabeled ziplock bag just looks like candy.

Maybe the landing gear wasn’t coming down.

We couldn’t land at Burbank because we would’ve gone out on the Hollywood way. At LAX they had emergency landing protocol waiting With nets and foam. We landed safely and were offered the option to either be bused back to Burbank or to take a special flight from LAX back to Burbank because they didn’t do LAX to Burbank flights at the time -  this was in the 90s.

"My go to “fancy” restaurant is Kali in Hollywood. They are Michelin starred and pricey but not crazy. The food is delicious and not overly pretentious. Anajak Thai as someone mentioned is fantastic and not your average thai restaurant. It’s really a unique experience in what looks to be a regular thai restaurant. In Burbank, we do like the prime rib and martinis at smoke house. They have been around for ages and it has an old vibe to it. Kind of cool. Castaway is pretty, food is fine but nothing to write home about. Yuzu and Kabosu both have fantastic sushi if you’re from somewhere sushi isn’t readily available. Downtown has a lot of cool restaurants if you can get a reservation- bestia, bavel, damian, majordomo etc. I would check out eater la’s list of the 38 essential and this months hottest restaurants.

"Well, for one condos and apartments have different building codes. 

Second (and working in banking I’ve seen this), how many of these new condo owners could afford, or be able to borrow, $20k-$50k on a dime for an emergency repair required by the HOA? For example, at the Surfside condo in Florida that collapsed, a big issue that delayed repairs was the owners assessments ranging from $80,190 for one-bedroom units to $336,135 for the owner of the building's four-bedroom penthouse required to funds repairs that may have prevented the collapse. A corporation might be able to take out a single loan for repairs and spread that cost out over 30 years. 

There is a huge difference between renting and owning, and we saw the effects of making home loans to people who shouldn’t have qualified in 2008 already.

In addition to that, there’s townhomes which I’ve seen purchased and then put up for rent.

I’d like to see a law ruled out similar to what they have in Massachusetts for trailer parks: “when the owner decides to sell the property: current tenants get right of first refusal.”

"First, I’m not sure you have the right to tell a homeowner who they can sell to. 

Let’s say this does pass and homeowners don’t contest it (I would), the problem you create is that it may be difficult or even impossible for new homeowners to get bank loans to purchase homes within Burbank because this condition essentially denies the bank the ability to foreclose on the property if the loan goes bad. 

Even if a carve out is made, by denying corporations the right to purchasing property, you throw the value into the wind because it’s not accurate now that you have taken out a portion of the demand. If Banks don’t know the accurate value, they can’t make a loan to a person to buy it. Because the selling restrictions is significantly different from the norm, the new purchase may not qualify for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac loans, which the vast majority of new home owners rely on. 

So, in short, you should not ban corporate ownership because it will likely have the opposite effect and prevent people from getting loans to purchase homes.",t2_d36cz,00oo0oo00,0,1646942503.0,0,t1_i05d81c,i05d81c,True,BzhizhkMard,t3_t7eovj,https://www.reddit.com/r/burbank/comments/t7eovj/corporate_home_purchases/,Corporate Home Purchases,/r/burbank/comments/t7eovj/corporate_home_purchases/i05d81c/,1,r/burbank,0,1
