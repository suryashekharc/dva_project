I've had it for a couple years now. You have to use a phone that can switch networks on the fly. I get 5G in town and nothing in the hills. So it's just as good as Verizon and ATT here. The billing has saved me on overages without shutting down bandwidth. I switched from a Google Voice number so I have to dial international for local numbers. Some people see my phone as a Google voice number on caller ID. Co-workers would make jokes about me using a burner phone.

"I've been to the Peg House, had a burger and some pacific oysters. The food was good, even though it's a bit pricey.  
  
I've been to the Zoo countless times, and only once since they restructured it, which was the official opening day of the Skywalk. I liked the Skywalk a lot, it was at once thrilling (for a person who fears heights) and serene, nestled in the trees and all. The animal exhibits aren't entirely what they used to be, but there are some neat ones. And luckily the petting zoo was also open that day, so I got to meet some nice goats.  
  
I've at least stopped to see the Bunyan and Babe statues at the Trees of Mystery, but I never went deeper than that.

"Things I have not done but I feel like are classic Humboldt attractions that I have mild fomo for never having done:

Never been to trees of mystery. 

Never been to top of the world. 

Never stopped at the peg house (never don't. I know, I know Ive seen the stickers) 

Haven't been to the Zoo (really want to to the canopy walk there now especially). 

Never bought fish off the docks at Woodley Island Marina myself as an adult. (Did make the mistake of eating at the Cafe tho 1/10 do not recommend) 

Havent made it to Annie and Mary days

Never been to Savage Henry comedy club

Never been to the rodeo of the fair.

Never been to tip top club. 

Never gotten my truck stuck on the beach until the tide comes in and totals it.

Never played frogger on Broadway

Other quintessential local experiences I have had though and would recommend if you have not:

Driving out to Perolia or bald hills when lupine are blooming.

Going to Klamath during salmon season just to watch the locals pull nets. 

Buying some treasures at the Arcata scrap yard

Feeding the ravens at Clam Beach (this one might be illegal but if anyone cares they can fight me AND my murder of friends) 

Checking out mad river fish hatchery and getting in the river on a hot day

Hiking to strawberry rock and chatting with tree sitters

"Oh, we understand vertical construction. We just don't need basements.

You mostly find basements in areas where the frost line is very deep. A building's footings have to be buried below that frost line, and that creates a space large enough that it might as well be used... thus, a basement. They're a nice side effect of a construction necessity, not an added feature. (But a finished basement? That *is* a real perk.)

In most of California you don't have to go very deep at all to erect the footings for a new house. Which means a basement is a wholly unnecessary added cost.

">And there was only one vendor selling beer.. Arcata Main Street.

Up until the early 2000s, beer was sold by a vendor, and Main Street sold mimosas using alcohol purchased at Costco. What you are describing could very well be the case, but in more recent years.

Do you know why the festival been moved away from the Plaza? Did downtown merchants oppose the festival, or are they angry the event isn't on the Plaza anymore?

Historically, Plaza stores hated the event because vendor booths faced the center of the Plaza, essentially creating a wall between the event and Plaza stores. Some stores did so poorly on that day they began closing for the day.

And then... Main Street reversed the direction of the vendor booths, so they formed a corridor, with attendees walking between the booths and the storefronts, and storefront sales improved.

That was about 20 years ago. I recall seeing that Plaza business-friendly corridor eliminated in some later years, which I'm sure pissed off business owners.

Holding the festival away from the Plaza seems antithetical to the Main Street mission of creating a vibrant downtown day and night, with the Plaza as the heart of the downtown. The Creamery district is literally not the downtown district, correct? If so, Main Street is no longer serving its purpose for existing through that event.",t2_69ixo,bookchaser,0,1648702214.0,0,t1_i2t7cma,i2t7cma,False,[deleted],t3_tsigea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/tsigea/oysterfest_2022_happening_behind_the_creamery_in/,"Oysterfest 2022!! _Happening Behind the Creamery in the Big Field, A much Smaller event but even more room to move!",/r/Humboldt/comments/tsigea/oysterfest_2022_happening_behind_the_creamery_in/i2t7cma/,5,r/Humboldt,0,5

"Humboldt feels distinctly Californian to me. Almost everyone I meet has some form of family or connection to other parts of California but not often from elsewhere. The nearest large city is San Francisco and the cultural influence is immediately apparent. You see a mix of Victorian and mission style architecture in the towns and while everywhere has hippies our hippies are very ""Bay area"".

Though weirdly outside of this,  Humboldt has more in common with SoCal than the bay. While it's global at this point, Humboldt Bay area at least seems to have more support for skateboarding youth culture than even LA does. The metal bands regardless of genre retain this stoner doom characteristic of Californian desert rock. It's full of folk who want to live in isolation but make huge weird but cool art sculptures just like in the Mojave. Lastly (while this particular connection may be tenuous) the region is in love with reggae in the same way SoCal is still in love with ska which is a genre directly influenced by reggae. As a region, I sometimes like to think of the Redwoods as being a ""twin"" of the Californian Mojave/Sonora.

People online (but conspicuously never irl) argue that Humboldt is Cascadian, but that has never felt right to me. Cascadia was always described to me as encompassing ""all river basins which run through north American temperate rainforest"" which to me is a shallow basis for building a community. Hell even on an ecoregional basis this is too simplistic. Keep in mind, redwoods evolved to handle the exact same mega droughts that all of California deals with and retains a lot of the characteristics of California's Mediterranean climates as most plant life need to grab as much water they can as they can in the wet winter to prepare for the drier summer. Humboldt, San Diego, Owens Valley etc. all follow the same rhythms and struggles regardless of day to day climate. To me this is a basis for building a community. In particular all Californians understand the struggle for water, and ironically our states history of using water as a commodity is giving more and more of us the collective lesson of what happens when resources are monopolized and not used to uplift vulnerable communities. We have a long long way to go in undoing our abuses of the land and each other, but I think these connections can provide a stronger cultural foundation for Humboldt as a region and as part of a wider community. Much stronger than ""cold+trees=PNW"".

It also ignores that while some claim our foundation of environmentalism is inherently cascadian, California also has major roots in this respect. We just didn't have the luxury of only getting a huge population until after environmentalism became a thing, and not when all of the Western world didn't care about the environment.",t2_6y9x9,mrgrimmsby,0,1648404699.0,0,t1_i2ca5ue,i2ca5ue,True,WeakLiberal,t3_towadq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/towadq/which_cultural_zone_do_you_place_yourself_in_does/,Which cultural zone do you place yourself in?

The urchins are going to be at the edge of the water. I've found urchins also at Shelter Cove and the Old Man surf spot at the bottom of the wildcat/front of 7 mile beach.

"They are easy to build, but most of the ones I see in Humboldt are rotting due to improper upkeep and have no semblance of adhering to code. If you're going to do it yourself, I'd suggest overbuilding unless you want to be constantly repairing it down the road or worse.

The last time I was asked to patch one up the homeowner waited until his wife fell through it and ended up immobile for weeks. When I checked under it over 50% of the supporting beams and posts were dry rotted. Still refused to accept that it needed to be torn down.

A deck in this climate needs to be cleaned regularly, and resanded and resealed EVERY year. If you're not willing to do this, then you should not get a deck, or expect to need to tear it down in ten years or less depending on the type of wood.

">when you say ~20% is caused by transportation, you're neglecting to mention that that figure also includes airplanes and shipping

Transportation is responsible for 29% of emissions, and of that 29, 58% is caused by light-duty motor vehicles on land. 58% of 29% = 16.82% of emissions are caused by small vehicles. If you include medium- and large-duty vehicles, the percentage goes up to 24% of all emissions are caused by motor vehicles on land. I cannot find statistics that only include light- and medium-duty, though I suspect that it would be around 20%.

Airplanes are responsible for 2.9% of all emissions, with ships and boats accounting for 0.58%. 

All statistics listed only apply to ""United States""  emissions. It may be that the boat and plane statistics are skewed due to the amount of time that they operate in international airspace or waters, though I cannot say how much at this time, or if the statistics actually account for this after all. https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions

I do know that, globally, ocean-faring boats account for 3% of all emissions.


>It would be amazing if we had better public transportation up here, but until we do people are going to have to drive.

As sad as it is, the public transit infrastructure won't ever be here until people start generating a demand for it. It's a fucked up chicken-and-egg kind of thing.

Additionally, the more people that use privately owned cars, the more cash that the morons in Sacramento and on County supervisory boards will dedicate to the roads, instead of where it should be going: to building decent public transit infrastructure.

"Welcome!!

I see Trinidad is on your list and I highly recommend it. Trinidad Head is a nice beautiful walk. And I recommend the food (especially ice cream) at Lighthouse Grill!

I'd also suggest driving along the Peninsula: From Arcata take the 255 towards Samoa/Manila. Once you get to Manila you can go to the Dunes there: If you Google Ma-le'l Dunes it'll take you by the gun club and there are a few nice spots out that direction. If you keep heading past Manila you'll end up driving by Samoa Beach (the town of Samoa is actually super tiny and only has the Samoa Cookhouse to eat at). Samoa Beach is a good spot, but honestly, you can continue to drive south all the way to the North Jetty and check out any of the beaches along that way. A very popular beach to watch the sunset out this direction is on Bay st (turn right on Bay St and it has a small parking lot by the beach).

If you're staying in Arcata and want a relaxing lunch time spot I would suggest picking up food then heading to the Community Forest to just have a nice picnic at the park there. It's a big field and you can enjoy the sunshine and throw the Frisbee around while you people watch the locals. Then you can explore the trails that are right there next to HSU.

One of my other favorite spots honestly is Ferndale: I love to hike Russ Park (it's not actually a park, but a trail lol) and Centerville Beach is nice.

Unfortunately, I wouldn't say tacos are really a hot commodity in this area =\  But for food I will highly recommend McIntosh Farm Country Store. They have yummy breakfast and lunch and their donuts are hella good!

I'm also not very helpful when it comes to breweries, but for a date night in Arcata I would recommend Slice of Humboldt Pie. They have a multitude of ciders on tap (I'm personally more of a cider person than a beer person) and they also have delicious pie and empanadas. A short walk from Slice of Humboldt Pie is Cafe Mokka. I've seen some others on here recommend it and I second that choice. It's a small little coffee shop that is, without doubt, my favorite little place in Humboldt. It's a great spot to just sip on a coffee (or in my case, hot chocolate with lots of whip cream!!!) and take a moment to breathe. They also have hot tubs that you can take a soak in and I find to be very relaxing. I would recommend going in the evening when it's a bit chilly out and you can really enjoy the warmth and quiet of the hot tubs. It's like taking a trip to a whole other world.

If you're in town over the weekend something else I'd recommend checking out is the Arcata Farmers Market. It's on Saturday mornings at the Plaza (the center of town) and I always recommend the Farmers Market to people visiting so they can just feel the community of Arcata and see the people. Something about it feels really welcoming to me and you can walk around and get some fresh fruit or a little food and just enjoy yourself.

Hopefully this helps! I absolutely love Arcata and Humboldt and all I can say is that no matter what you choose to do you can't go wrong because there is soooo much to visit and see!",t2_g7vu3,Barkingcat29,0,1647556530.0,0,t1_i12wdir,i12wdir,True,Hairydrunk,t3_tf354e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/tf354e/vacation_stops_checklist/,Vacation stops checklist,/r/Humboldt/comments/tf354e/vacation_stops_checklist/i12wdir/,2,r/Humboldt,0,2

"Everyone has their own experience but I'll tell you this, sweetheart motors is under new ownership. My wife and I bought a Honda from him the day my dad died.

Trust me, I checked around weeks later and we got a fair deal on solid car that is STILL our daily driver 2 years later. Plus, there were a few minor things that kept popping up over the first few months and he always made sure to have his mechanic take care of it (free of charge). The one thing is, that if you have bad credit and you have to finance, your gonna pay extra. It's a trade of though because it's fixed my wife's credit because she's kept up with payments.

"Have a used car checked out by a mechanic of your choosing. A dealership worth anything will let you do this. Find out what repairs are really needed.

Instead of coming down in price, you may find that, oh, huh, the dealership then wants to make the situation right by having its own mechanic do the repairs prior to purchase. If you do that, I'd have your chosen mechanic inspect the vehicle again afterward.  Don't tell your chosen mechanic what dealership you are buying from. If you're especially suspicious, have a different mechanic do the re-inspection, because you'll have had to divulge the first mechanic you used when you show the dealership the repair estimate.

Don't let the dealership BS you on price, either. My first used car negotiation involved settling on a price with the salesman, sitting down at his desk, and waiting for him to come back with the papers. Huh, he's taking a long time. Then the dealership owner comes out and says he can't sell the car at that price, I have to leave some meat on the bone, looking at me expecting I'm going to agree. They broke a verbal agreement on the price. I walked out. 

A few weeks later the dealership was in the news for an employee selling drugs out of the car lot. That's unrelated, but yeah, I hate dealing with car dealerships.

For my next car, I went through Costco's new car auto program which provides an up-front set price. Once at the dealership, just say no to all the expensive extras they want to pile on like an extended warranty for the car electronics.

"Walk around Arcata - there are five dispensaries within short walking distance of the Plaza (Humboldt Patient Resource Center, The Heart of Humboldt, Pacific Paradise, The Fireplace, Herb & Market). I’m probably even missing some. 

Papa & Barkley is a cannabiz that manufactures their own product to sell and also has a storefront and smoking lounge in Eureka. It’s on Broadway, on the south end of town. 

Brio and Big Blue on the Plaza have good coffee and breakfasts (Brio is more bougie). Ramone’s is my favorite for coffee and they have a couple locations, one of them inside Wildberries which is a supermarket up the hill from the Plaza. 

As far as breweries go, I agree with what everyone else recommended but I am also throwing Mad River Brewery into the ring. It was recently bought by the Yurok tribe and is located in a teeny town called Blue Lake in the valley about ten minutes inland on 299.

"I mean, if breweries, taprooms, tacos, dispensaries and coffee are you thing, seek them out, but nobody takes a vacation to Humboldt County seeking those things out... no matter how much Eureka's city council and county tourism officials would love to believe.

>Endert Beach 

>Clam Beach

>Samoa Dunes

Not those destinations. Clam Beach is exceptionally uninteresting, unless your love a standard flat featureless beach that has almost no clams (unlike in the past). The beach I would visit is Luffenholtz Beach in Trinidad.  Everyone has their own favorite beaches in Trinidad though.

Trinidad State Beach is okay, particularly the part at the end of Edwards Street in town. To the east is Trinidad Pier, and in between it is Trinidad Head which has a nice trail around the head with oceans views. You may catch a peek of the original Trinidad Lighthouse on the head, now open only during occasional tours during the summer. It's a super small lighthouse.

Sue-meg State Park is a good visit (formerly called Patrick's Point State Park, named after a murderous asshole... California is in the process of reconciling its place names with history). Sue-meg Village is found there, a recreation of a Yurok village. The tribe, California's largest, uses the village for some ceremonies and events. I was invited to a [flower dance](https://www.northcoastjournal.com/humboldt/the-flower-dancers/Content?oid=10229320) there.  You're also likely to meet one or two Yurok park rangers in North Coast parks. For me, they are like local celebrities, having listened and watched their live streams during shelter-in-place educating people about the parks. There are a number of beaches and viewpoints at Sue-meg... Wedding Rock, Agate Beach, etc.

Their aftercare (checking up on me, being available for questions) is excellent. 

They “do” fecals, but they’re insanely expensive for a basic fecal (I want to say $60 just for worms etc.) and they send it out to a lab which isn’t very useful/accurate as a vet that does it in house. just fyi. good luck, i love my babies so I do my best out here for em

"A security deposit goes to the landlord, and gets paid back when the tenant moves out, unless there is a legitimate reason for the landlord to keep a portion of the deposit.

A new renter giving a $1,000 security deposit to a tenant who is moving out not only makes no sense, it is kissing $1,000 goodbye.

If multiple roommates signed a lease, the security deposit stays with the lease until the last roommate moves out. Yes, that kind of sucks for roommates who leave earlier than other roommates. It's up to the remaining roommates to agree to pay a portion of the security deposit cost to those roommates who are departing, with the remaining roommates taking that money out of their personal savings because the actual security deposit is still being held by the landlord until all tenants have moved out.",t2_69ixo,bookchaser,0,1647151270.0,0,t1_i0gnunw,i0gnunw,True,[deleted],t3_tctad4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Humboldt/comments/tctad4/room_available_in_myrtletown/,Room available in Myrtletown,/r/Humboldt/comments/tctad4/room_available_in_myrtletown/i0gnunw/,2,r/Humboldt,0,2

"I'm not sure how old your cat is or if they would allow it, but I touch my cats' paws \*all the time\*. When they're sleeping, when we're just hanging out... I've been doing it since they were kittens. It makes them a lot more tolerant of having their paws fiddled with when its time to trim their nails. 

If you've never done it before, the sound of a grinder might freak your cat out even more than trying to do it with clippers. Definitely get clippers made for a cat, do it with good lighting so you can see the quick, and if your kitty is too stressed, try to get them while they're sleeping.

"When I lived there 2004-2017.  There was a lot of great food from crafty type kitchens and food trucks/tents at the events.  I'm sure if you look around and ask you'll make some great finds

I loved the Korean taco truck in Arcata

Chicken flutas at the speedy taco truck in Mac (not much else there)...  

There was a great sushi place in eureka (Kyoto?)

Brick and fire in eureka was awesome

The little organic cafe in Ferndale

Renata's crepes in arcata

La trattoria in Arcata

AA in eureka surprisingly had great steaks

Folie Douce in Arcata depending on the owner at the time.

Not sure what's still there and not anymore.  And no it won't ever rival a large City.  I'm definitely forgetting some others In this short list.  But I miss my favorite food up there for sure.
