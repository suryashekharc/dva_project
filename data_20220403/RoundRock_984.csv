"> I've been in the area for over twenty years - Hairy Man is within blocks of me - and the legend is a lot more interesting than that.

Hello neighbor, probably also in Stone Canyon!

> Apparently, the Hairy Man was once a child who fell ...

That's the legend, and there were plenty of variations. 

The common thread I get from the variations is that there was a vagrant who was hairy lived by or near the bluff. Most of the variations are that he wanted to live alone, and was aggressive to people who tried to visit.

It's super easy to imagine someone in the 1850's or 1860s living along the creek bed, living 3 miles outside the town of Brushy (as Round Rock was first known).  

For non-neighbors, near the middle of Hairy Man Road there is a [bluff that is surrounded and covered by ferns and other plants](https://www.google.com/maps/@30.5236263,-97.729453,2a,75y,109.51h,88.34t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1shD0Xvy-4gCXzDmf4q4UIXg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656) that could easily have been a living place for someone, with a nice soft natural bed and natural shelter, next to the water.  It's about two miles from the Chisholm Trail crossing, and about 3 miles from the original town center. Even if he didn't live in the bluff itself, there are plenty of spots nearby that would be great.

Yeah, ""Brushy Creek"", ""Hairy Man"", and ""Fern Bluff"", someone was feeling creative with names.

Exactly how he or the story came to be there is a bit of a mystery.  Odds are that the man himself was true, it's a pretty area with lots of wildlife and edible plants, it would have been easy to subsist off the land 150 years ago. His origin story and the legends about him are probably more a tall tale.",t2_fj9rl,rabid_briefcase,0,1648750065.0,0,t1_i2vlwq8,i2vlwq8,False,HolmesHommie,t3_tsn75l,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/tsn75l/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_seen_hairy_man/,Have you or anyone you know seen Hairy Man?,/r/RoundRock/comments/tsn75l/have_you_or_anyone_you_know_seen_hairy_man/i2vlwq8/,3,r/RoundRock,0,3

Slight chance there is a persisting legal code / building code / air flight path / golf course preservation... preventing towers.

"Pure bullshit speculation being yanked right out of my ass:

&#x200B;

I get the impression that no one expected Stone Hill to explode the way it did. Because of that they've been unable to handle infrastructure like cell coverage. No one bothered to look into whether or not there are cell towers there so now everyone goes to Target or Chili's for the free wifi.

&#x200B;

They're completing the 3rd hotel/motel/suites combo building behind the Target. It's right next to the previous two brand new hotel/suite combo buildings. So we've got a Tru by Hilton next door to a Holiday Inn and the La Quinta is almost done.

&#x200B;

That's like insane growth. If three hotels are built right next to each other, someone out there thinks the population is large enough to support those three hotels RIGHT FUCKING NEXT TO EACH OTHER. We're not talking about a budget alternative to Kalahari, there's no meeting/convention complex in Stone Hill. We just have 3 hotels next door to each other. Of course, the parking lots are separated lol. It seems idiotic to me but my job isn't commercial/retail development.

&#x200B;

So Stone Hill is now a hotspot but someone forgot to look into cell towers. Then again, it might save the cellular guys some money if they don't erect a tower that will instantly burn red like molten lava due to the instant strain on it.

&#x200B;

"Wood Glen, Hidden Glen and Behrens Ranch are all good neighborhoods zoned for Old Town Elementary, Walsh Middle, and Round Rock High School. We loved Old Town--great teachers, great admin and counseling staff.  Walsh Middle School is academically very good, but otherwise not great.  Bullying and racism are an endemic problem, exacerbated by fanatical parents.  Some of the coaches are outright drill sergeants, but I guess they're supposed to be.  They made my nerdy, uncoordinated son absolutely miserable.  If students weren't athletic, the coaches treated them like prison inmates.  My son referred to PE as ""the Gulag."" One of the principals there had to retire early becuase he used a racial slur at a student, but several parents and teachers refused to do any kind of training or community outreach to prevent racism from flourishing on campus. My son seems very happy as a freshman at RRHS.  Their test scores are often as good as or better than Westwood's.  (Shh. . .Westwood doesn't want you to hear that.) As far as campus climate, RRHS is wecoming and everyone seems to be able to find a place to belong.

Yes, if you’re posting about someone’s dog being hit by a car in the subreddit for the city you’re in, it does need to be helpful info and not just “a dog got hit by a car, here’s the gory details”.

"Jibbajaba just doin jibbajaba nonsensicial bullshit.....sounds like you've never been attacked by a dog...my dogs have been about 20 times and I can tell you the attacking dogs can't be stopped sometimes, even by screaming at them.  So I carry a stick and have had to use it in self defense.  Some dogs do a ""tough guy"" charge but don't want to really attack.  For Those dogs I bang the stick on the ground and say don't fucking go there.     


However there are dogs that go after you no matter what, so you have to beat the shit out of them until they stop...period.  Then they get it in their heads they want seconds...and then I hit them again until they stop.   Then, the fucknut owners then come out and start screaming at me at which point i yell back and call the cops.    


I love dogs...I love cats...but i don't like ass hole dogs or cats....I do my best to leave them alone if a loose one is on the street...but they are ass holes and have to spread their assholeness around like a bad joke...so they need to be bitch slapped like Chris Rock (just kidding ha ha)...but seriously.... dogs are fucking gnarly animals, esp pitties and you have to respect their power.  You can walk on the streets...but you can't carry a knife to a gun fight.   I personally don't carry a gun with me bec I fear I would hurt myself first with it....so I carry a table leg with a flat screw on the end in case I need to joust....I may upgrade to bear spray.

"Yes, it's like no shit, The BOA bank right next to them got major damage from a tornado directly overhead, Ross is still boarded up. Sure...would be nice if they could communicate out to customers who have set appointments that they are canceled, but chances are they have no power. Power has been cut to a lot of the homes and retail locations that were impacted until they can be properly inspected. I think a little bit of understanding...possibly compassion...is needed from OP's part Anyone that's traveled on 35 or 45 across that area this week has seen the damage and I would certainly call a business first in that area to verify they are open. Heck I called Juarez bakery Tuesday morning to verify if they were open for business.

In a best case scenario a permit could be pulled the same day the work starts, rebuilding the service could be done in a day, and the inspection is 24-48 hours. If the electrician calls in the inspection the same day he pulled the permit and started the work, you might save a day but a lot of guys won't call it in until the work is 100% and all of this is IF he is not busy and can start right away.

1-day acquire material and pull permit. (unless the electrician has all he needs on his truck).  Typically once you find an electrician and set a day to do the work, this will include getting the material the day before.

"Electrician here, this is correct:

>Oncor says that they disconnected service and removed the meter and that it is my responsibility to contact a contract electrician to come out and effect some sort of unspecified repair. Then, after that, I'll have to go to the city to request an inspector come out to inspect the electrical service.

You own the panel, the meter base, and the drop from weatherhead, Oncor provides the wire from their pole to your drop.  If your part of the service is damaged, you will need to hire an electrician to come and rebuild it.  Call around and see if someone can come out soon.

"“the power lines” may be your issue. Like seriously. If your power lines were severed from the power pole to your weather head, that’s kind of a big issue. The weather head into your main service is your responsibility.

"All through tornado alley when the alerts go off people dart to the windows. If they don't see anything nearby, life continues as normal.

The news alerts, the watches and warnings are amazing. They save a lot of lives. People can become more aware of their surroundings than ever before.  Weather radios, cell phones, computers, and assorted other devices all come to life the moment radar detects the circular wind.

With that extra awareness you get advance notice at recognizing when you need to take immediate action, like hearing the sirens while also hearing the low rumbling from the wind. They're great for that.

"> This isn't supposed to be a thing here.

You must have missed the memo that we are on the southern tip of tornado ally. For years we had the distinction of the most powerful tornado on record, now just one of the most powerful ever, happened in our area. That was the Jarrell tornado complex in '97.

We get tornadoes in the region almost every year.

It absolutely IS a thing here. 

>  If the warning has been issued it is often after the rotation has already begun. 

Yes, it is important to know the difference between a watch and a warning.

A watch means the ingredients are present but they have not yet been observed. They are watching.

A warning means it is active, and the warnings are automatically triggered when radar detects the rotation.

Even going the opposite direction of the general rush hour traffic will absolutely get you hung up on intersections that can take time to clear. So they are basically telling you to waste untold hours of your life in your car and money on gas and rent/mortgage so you can save about 10/15 minutes of travel time to go downtown or to the Domain a few times a month.

"Eh, I was single while living in NW Austin, and the folks I dated were fairly evenly distributed between Austin and the northern suburbs. Especially if you're open to online dating, finding folks to date if you want to date shouldn't be a problem. I ended up with a RR guy, so hey... worked for me.

Honestly, the traffic is the sticking point, and it's only going to get worse with everything they're building up here. I live right near the 35/45 flyover, and I almost never see traffic flowing smoothly any more. There's always some congestion there and then again a few exits down near Parmer. 

Ten years ago, I lived in NW Austin near the Arboretum and commuted down south every day to work near Ben White & 35 (south Austin). The commute sucked, but it sucked for about 45 minutes each way. I can't even imagine doing that now. I've spent 45 minutes pre-pandemic getting to work 10 miles away without ever hopping on a freeway. (Took me 15 minutes during the height of the pandemic.) If you can live close-ish to work, use all that free time you save with a shorter commute to go out and enjoy whatever you want to enjoy. Over time, you'll learn what areas to avoid when if possible, and you can get in and out of Austin easy enough when you want. Not as easily as before, but there are ways.

There are Austin-only purists out there who'll have you believe everything outside the city limits is a consumerist conglomerate-infested dumpster fire, but really you just need to get off 35 and look. (I have a cousin who always says she has to ""go north"" whenever she has to go beyond 183 with a uniquely disgusted look. It amuses me.)

"You do not want to meet people in Round Rock’s downtown. Tried twice and no fucking thank you. The Domain is an even worse decision. Georgetown isn’t a thing. Yes dating is bad everywhere but Round Rock is still podunk burbs underneath all the new stuff they’ve built up over the past few years. 

If you’re making enough to deal with tolls I’d say something off the east side with easy access to downtown Austin and highway 130 is your best bet. 

I get you said you’re not a bar or club person but that’s exactly why you live close to Austin’s downtown. There’s so much food, live music, and other options on any night of the week in Austin. The only thing to do in Round Rock is drink. Food is subpar, the drinks aren’t as good as downtown Austin. I’d pay $13 for one amazing drink in Austin than $10 for some watered down version of a craft cocktail in RR. 

University is also the north most part of Round Rock before heading into Georgetown. There is nothing good up there. 

31 and single, go to the east side of Austin with easy access to 130 if you can afford it for sure. South to north is also the opposite way of traffic in the morning.

"Fuck Austin, it’s overrated and a pain in the ass, 34 and was born here, lived in Houston for 5 and  although much bigger has a better vibe than Austin. Round rock is far superior to Austin, it’s so close geographically, but so far away you don’t have to think about dealing with it. Avoid 35 at all costs, regardless of the time of day there are multiple spots that are consistently stopped due to the infrastructure that forces traffic onto it and bottlenecks the flow. Round rock has a couple of these places and it gets worse the further south you go. Austin did not develop the highways to sustain the traffic it sees to purposely try to prevent the migration that happened anyway, and now it’s too far gone to think about fixing.

"when you say ""a note"" do you mean like a handwritten note? a citation?

if the latter, i imagine there is a phone number on it somewhere. call that number and ask what is going on, citing specifics like the identification number on the citation, name of the officer, location of the vehicle.

if the former, chuck it in the trash and go on about your life.

peel off the sticker and move the car into your driveway for a couple months. that resets the clock on someone reporting it, heh. after a couple months, put it back in front of your house.

The only Round Rock bus connecting to Howard Lane Station is from La Frontera. The earliest it leaves La Frontera is 6:53 am, and the latest it leaves Howard Lane Station is 7:30 pm; only on weekdays.

The Metro Rail takes 34 minutes from Howard Lane Station to Downtown Station. The bus from La Frontera takes 12 minutes. So 46 minutes from La Frontera of just travel time, not counting waiting in between, assuming no delays. Plus whatever time it takes to get to La Frontera, since there are no homes around there.

And yes RRISD started in Round Rock, hence the name.  Doesn't change it's existence now.  

Also Austin did extend PAST Anderson Mill 20 years before the 2000s.  The city had area north of 620 in the 80s.  Not that I quite understand what that has to do with anything.  ISDs build schools outside of their named city all the time.  Even now.  

Quite a bit of growth has happened since the early 2000s.  Sure some cities felt more separated.  Georgetown was several exits from Round Rock with basically nothing at those exits but ranches.  Not the case now.  Now it's Ikea, an outlet mall, some car dealerships, shopping centers, etc.  If you were from out of town you'd have no idea anyone cared it wasn't part of Austin.  

I also have no idea why you're saying I don't think Round Rock exists.  It's a municipality.  They have their own laws, police, fire, city council, town center, libraries, history, etc.  It absolutely exists.

">What who is going to do?  The small shops disappear because they can't survive.  Could be rent prices, customers going to other options, owner dies, who knows.

Or it could be the tax incentives to bring in companies outside of Texas without any care for the local workers at all.

So, people commuting in from Arlington or Fort Worth to Dallas means that Fort Worth or Arlington doesn't exist? 

Round Rock ISD started in ...\*checks map\* Round Rock? Literally where Berkman Elementary is. They pushed in the 1970s into MUDs (you know districts that are currently not part of a city) in what is now Northwest Austin. 

You do realize that Austin didn't extend to Anderson Mill until the early 2000s, right? Round Rock extended down that way because they could and Austin had no claims to that area.

"I'm not a councilor, not yet anyways. I do hope to become one, and I'm flattered by your words and glad to serve in any way I can. 

I started working on this when someone sent me a Instagram link from a resident who was really worried. I grew up around the guys who deal with this for a living, and while that doesn't make me an expert at all (really, I don't have much knowledge) it did give me an understanding of what they were saying and where they were coming from. 

I also understand the fear and frustration of the residents. When you hear phrases like ""total suspended solids"" it can seem like a deflection or like they are trying to complicate it. 

I don't understand the science well enough to explain all the terminology or why it matters how the poop floats/flows, but I do know that it does matter. And seeing it isn't reflective of the health of the water. You can have a turd floating down the stream and the water is safe, or you can have water that looks clean, but contains dangerously high levels of bacteria. 

I'm not an expert in waste management nor am I an environmental scientist. I just know people and how to see through the words they are saying to hear the words they are meaning. Wastewater management is extremely upset and stressed about this. They are taking the contamination and any harm caused by it extremely personally, it's weighing them a lot more then they can professionally say. They are also taking a lot of heat over this and that comes with its own set of anxiety, as if everything else wasn't enough.

And while the residents are coming across as angry they are afraid. They talked about tourism, property value, and wildlife conservation in the meetings, and while that does matter, they are scared for their health and the wellbeing of their kids, grandkids, pets, and neighbors. And they feel like, unless it's about the financial impact to the city, then no one cares. 

I think that this has really highlighted the elephant in the room. The residents don't feel like the city hears them or takes what they say seriously. They feel like no effort is being put into outreach, and when they do show up to speak, they feel like no one is listing. I know that isn't always the case, sometimes there isn't an answer available and other times it isn't possible to accommodate what has been asked for. But I do think there are ways we can help to bridge the communication gap.",t2_iuv3sw9x,RRs-Caitlin,0,1647038652.0,0,t1_i0au0kk,i0au0kk,False,buntaro_pup,t3_t82bqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/,Round Rock wastewater plant seeing increase in wastewater levels | kvue.com,/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/i0au0kk/,3,r/RoundRock,0,3

"When a road is built the civil engineer (I have 20 years experience as a civil designer) will create plans for the proposed road. Every road is defined by a right of way. That is the boundary of the road. It can never become wider than the right of way. Then every road has a centerline within the right of way. The centerline is the basis for everything which is to be constructed. The centerline has what are called stations. The stations are spaced every 100' or 50' of road. Using these stations and ""offsets"" how far left or right of the centerline provides a sort of coordinate system to define lanes, curbs,  sidewalks, etc. Also water mains, sewer mains and storm drainage lines all have stationing. That is how the road features are conveyed to the contractor so he knows what to build. Here in Texas. TXDOT the Texas department of transportation has a set of standards for the construction of roads and all of the utilities that are associated with building a road. Everything that is called for on the plans must have a detail drawing showing all required elements of that particular feature. In other cases the municipality where the work is being done also has their own set of standards. Some are more comprehensive than others. Sometimes a plan must also be created to show what lanes must be closed and temporary construction traffic patterns. Other times the contractor will build to meet the plans while doing his best to maintain normal traffic. The plans tell the contractor what must be built. It is not permitted to dictate the ""means and methods"" of how he will actually conatruct the road. Normally they will take wooden stakes and the coordinates from stationing from the road centerline and put a stake where every part of the road such as start and end of turn lanes, sidewalks, light poles, etc. With his proposed road staked out he will lay his curb. Think of it as a mold for him to drop the road in. The road is constructed in 3 layers typically. A subgrade which is the sand, dirt, clay, etc that is naturally present that has been compacted  and stabilized 12"" thick for city roads and up to 3' thick for highways Then is the base, the base is crushed gravel graded to a specific size and also compacted and stabilized. Usually from 6""-12"" thick. Last is the asphalt.  The asphalt is usually 2 layers. The coats are called lifts. The first lift will be installed and compacted to a certain density. Then a tack coat will be applied which allows the second lift to adhere to the first. After the second lift has been compacted to 98% total density per AASHTO-T180 standard the road opens and you can drive on it",t2_gk0e2t8v,Key-Sun6443,0,1646987620.0,0,t1_i07w1c7,i07w1c7,True,ParkingWave5526,t3_tb7n35,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/tb7n35/progress_on_university/,Progress on University,/r/RoundRock/comments/tb7n35/progress_on_university/i07w1c7/,4,r/RoundRock,0,4

"I've spoken with the waste water department as well as some of the residents along the creek. 

The good news is:

• that the rate at which the water is flowing in from the leak means that it's unlikely to contaminate the ground due to the pressure of the incoming water.

• they have cameras already in the lines searching for any sign, both visual and sonar.

• it isn't because of the rapid development. Our metrics show that we are well below the threshold even with the projected development.

• Round Rock has a policy where contractors are to be held financially liable for any damage or stress caused to our infrastructure. (I don't know if it's being enforced yet)

The bad news is;

• The leak is likely directly under a large body of water, so a creek or pond 

• our wastewater plant is regional. We share it with 3 other cities, and all of them have to agree to any changes made above a set amount. 

• one of the cities isn't feeling cooperative.

• we don't have an accurate projected development from all of the cities.

• The TEQC standards are low enough that we should be asking that we pass a city ordinance to decrease the acceptable levels of all negative chemicals/bacteria.

And the biggest and most concerning is that the city hasn't been fully transparent. I have had some wonderful and honest conversations with our wastewater department and they are drowning. They are following, and where they have the budget to do so, exceeding all requirements. But those are the absolute minimum. We can, and should, ask for more. The wastewater team are working overtime, round the clock, and taking the brunt if the blame. While our plant is regional, it is owned and operated by Round Rock. 

I don't know how the cost is allocated. I will be asking more questions.

We can show the staff in the wastewater department our support. They are doing all they can within the parameters and budget set out for them. 

We need to demand more transparency from our city. 


I will be reaching out to the Austin Wastewater department and asking questions. I also have a contact in a wastewater department that I will be asking for clarification from.



What I think we should do is to have Austin send a consultant up to talk us through what's different and how we can achieve a higher quality of discharged water. Have an environmental study done by Texas state, through a grant, to make recommendations on what we can do to best preserve out waterways.",t2_iuv3sw9x,RRs-Caitlin,0,1646964636.0,0,t1_i06t93v,i06t93v,True,buntaro_pup,t3_t82bqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/,Round Rock wastewater plant seeing increase in wastewater levels | kvue.com,/r/RoundRock/comments/t82bqe/round_rock_wastewater_plant_seeing_increase_in/i06t93v/,4,r/RoundRock,0,4

"Is there an actual safety concern you have? Or just fear?

There's a heavy steel cable around most of the roads, and the parts that don't use the giant stone blocks. Run on the opposite side of that, plenty of cross-country runners already do.

They have paved walkways all through the park, and paths through various wooded areas near the water and through the few remaining trees. Plenty of walkers and runners use those, too.

Despite seeing a bunch of runners, walkers, joggers, and people with off-leash dogs almost every day, they don't have auto-pedestrian crashes. It isn't an actual safety problem the park has.

"Oh, please no. We don't need even more pavement at the park.

The park doesn't need extra sidewalks. 

As someone who is there at least 3x/week for many years, we've seen plenty of encroachment, paving over of open spaces, and blocking off of space. It seems every new development comes with more fences, the new ""Apex Soccer Fields"" on the north meant another quarter mile of new fencing around the place, and more pavement. The northern tennis courts before that again turned the open grassy spaces into pavement with fences. 

The reworking of the southern soccer fields got some sidewalks, but also some more barriers preventing any use other than soccer.  The new pavilion and terraces added even more barriers, they claimed it was so cross-country runners would have better facilities, but the cross-country runners are now looking at different parks, including moving to the South Wilco Park over by Cedar Park as they destroyed it for existing park users.

Don't do it. Please, don't do it.

"I was not given the opportunity to attend a university. I married my senior year and while I had planned to start classes that following semester, that's not how things worked out. The economy at the time was in a crisis and plans were set to the side. The marriage ended in speration, further delaying and complicating things.

I did, however, work in some of the most socioeconomically depressed child care centers in the area. I took every class and training available, with a focus on special needs and trauma. 

We need to recognize that a university education is not the only way to become a professional. Apprenticeships, on the job experience, and internships are valuable and underrated forms of education. Trade skills are a dying art, and leading to a shortage of skilled craftsman. 

I have no shame in the education or skills that I have gained or how I have gotten here. 


As for volunteering;
Through highschool I volunteered at every available opportunity. I exceeded 100 hours per school year in my community, I raised money for the Ronald McDonald house, I researched native plants, worked with a team that organized a reforestation effort that resulted in the planting of 140 trees, developed programming for child engagement in nature and history for Pioneer Farms, and volunteered as a docent at Pioneer farms (2005 - 2018). As I mentioned above, what followed graduation was turbulent at best, so my volunteer service was limited to what was already part of my established routine.

In 2018 I had to step back from all volunteer and career work for medical reasons. I began searching for new opportunities in late 2019, as I had recovered and felt that myself and my family were in a good place. Unfortunately 2020 brought the Covid 19 pandemic.

I made masks and hair wraps for law enforcement and medical professionals, as well as making and donating enough masks to fully supply all our local postal workers.

I dedicated my time to helping parents work through the sudden and unexpected homeschooling situation the found themselves in, finding them resources, virtual social opportunities.

During the winter storm (2021) I prepared hot meals for neighbors without power and carried water to neighbors without.

I have been working with a group to help bridge the communication gap between LGBTQIA children and their parents. Acting as a safe go between to help parents understand the social and emotional struggles their children face, and helping children understand the confusion and fear their parents are experiencing. This is still developing, so I will not provide any further details. 

I'm also deeply involved in Round Rock Pride and dedicated much of my time to them. 

I didn't put these in my bio because I didn't do them for the credit. I didn't do them for attention. I did them because I believe in my community. I care about the people here. I did them as an investment in tomorrow. I never expected thanks. 

My dad always said ""Kindness with a motive is never kindness. Charity with expectations is no charity at all. The ones who make the world better are the ones who do so quietly, consistently, and selflessly."" I took these words to heart and strive to be humble and practice gratitude and humility.

"This got a lot more of a response then I expected. 

I'm going to just answer it here in one comment instead of trying to answer everyone individually.


I miss when my oldest was little and couldn't sleep and we would walk up and down main street and sit in the plaza. We tried that with the youngest and a fight broke out in the middle of the street. This was around 8:30-9 on a weeknight. 

I feel like, for as much as my taxes have gone up in the last year, we are somehow getting less. I'm sure some of that is this is because of the pandemic, but while we used to enjoy Pokemon hunting after the library and stopping for ice cream, I feel like I'm taking my kids to classic 6th Street in Austin. When I was in middle school there was a coffee shop down town that we would go to, my boyfriend in highschool used to hang out at the library until it closed and then walk home, we'd stop at the Snack Shack for Dr Pepper and Cheetos. 

I remember falling in creek near the sam bass because I was trying to prove I wasn't scared of anything (in this case a snake) and they had to hose me off before we could go for coffee. 

When we bought I had hoped my kids would have similar freedom to explore safely, and at first it was true, now we have to leave when we can hear the bars. I'm also heartbroken over Wag•a•Bag. I remember bailing my sister out of trouble by picking her up at the one on Mays and Logan to get she and her friend home before her friends parents got back. 

I feel like Round Rock is becoming an extension of Austin and not the ""Mildly Weird"" town I fell in love with and made so many memories in.

"It is meaningless. All the sympathies and sanctions will not save Ukraine now, The Russian military is rolling over each village, town and city like an unstoppable tsunami. After Ukraine falls, Putin will enact his combination of eliminating the opposition and propaganda making it look like the Ukrainians welcome the Russians as saviors. This is what he did when he invaded Georgia, the Crimea and the Dombass region of Ukraine. And all this sympathy will be forgotten because we have short term memory and are impotent and led by an impotent president. Evil prevails when good men stand aside.

Edit: And this isn't over. Putin's ambition is to bring back all the breakaway Soviet republics back into Russia. Because some of those have ties to the US, Putin will have to pre-emptively nuke the US military. This won't be the end of the world because he just has to nuke enough of the US military to keep it from being able to challenge Russia. He bets Biden will not pull the trigger in response because Biden will be afraid to nuke the innocent people in Russia. Putin doesn't fear Biden at all. It looks like we will have to wait until then to finally stand up against Putin.

This isn't all. China just made a statement that the US support of Taiwan is futile after the Ukraine invasion. They see Putin's success as a framework for invading Taiwan. Several countries around there have pledged military support for Taiwan that we have ties with, so we will definitely be pulled into WWIII there.
