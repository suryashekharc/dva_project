Air travel is expensive. The most frequent fliers are wealthier. The poorest Americans are more likely than others to have never flown.

"With all the new development projects underway with the Pittsburgh International Airport and the Hill and Oakland Plans, I've become more and more passionate about pushing a light rail extension in Pittsburgh. Now I know, I know, it doesn't seem all that important or practical  to many, but I'd argue it is much more so than it would seem. And while the price would be substantial for even just the Spine Line, as noted in the cited studies, I believe it is well worth linking Downtown to Oakland. There's a lot of  argument that BRT alone should suffice, but with the amount of increased density and business that is planned to enter East of Downtown in the next 10 years, I don't think it's wise to disregard rail in favor of buses. Pittsburgh is a city uniquely more poised for a rail expansion than other similar sized cities, specifically with the development and recent Port Authority funding  it seems short sighted to neglect any rail extension.   
I put stops at most of the normal 28x stops to the West and then followed by one at Steel Plaza PPG Paint Arena, near Birmingham Bridge in Uptown, Oakland Avenue by UPMC and Pitt, Forbes at CMU, Murray & Forbes, and Frick Park for the East of the green line.

*I considered sending the Green Line through downtown and across the river closer to Point Park in order to have more service Downtown but figured the cost of building an entire new bridge when that might not be necessary would be a tough selling point.

**I also decided to have a fun with the current lines a little bit by sending the Blue Line to Union Station and up to the Heinz Lofts (though I considered alternatively connecting the Heinz loft by branching off the Red or Silver line to to go East instead of West after crossing the river. The Red Line I also sent up to North Park just to have more connection into the North Side.

If I were you, given what else you've said about yourself, I'd look just south of the city.

West Mifflin isn't a terribly interesting place imo, but it would be a similar commute to the other two and does have box stores like Target and Walmart if you value access to those kinds of stores. Pleasant Hills and south Baldwin Borough (not Baldwin Township which is a bit further) would be closer still and have some cool things with less access to Pittsburgh proper. You could also look at Homestead/West Homestead, ~20 minute commute most days, kind of close to Southside, and there's quite a bit going on at the Waterfront (though I wish it were more local).

"This argument is ridiculous. Americans are fat for two main reasons:

* We live in a culture that promotes over-eating. Whether it’s deliberate (all you can eat buffets) or influenced by retail (the ever increasing serving sizes that change the perception of a “normal” serving size) its a very accepted concept. While other nations have access to the same products, they tend to eat much more in moderation. 

* We live a sedentary lifestyle. While the initial response regarding car dependency was a bit narrow, it had truths to it. We aren’t active enough as a society. It’s a simple calories in, calories out, fat stored equation. I eat plenty (both good and bad food). But I also run 50-70 miles a week and opt for things like walking at the golf course instead of taking a golf cart. That’s why my weight has stayed within 5lbs of my baseline for about a decade now. 

Unfortunately, the responsibility falls on each person to turn their weight around (with the exception of people that genuinely have genetic influences impacting their weight).

If you want to take Asia as a vast continent of billions of people, the majority are choosing bad lifestyle choices because they have no good choices. Only bad food options, no access to regular screenings, etc. That isn't exactly the same as driving out of your office every day to pick up fast food 6-10 meals a week and just choosing to not eat healthy food that is so easily accessible to you.

>You started this all by railing against fat people for their poor health choices, but just acknowledged that skinny people die from these things too.

"I've lived in other countries, it's really what drove home how fat America is. Sure, a sedentary lifestyle plays a role in it but culturally we just accept eating junk and overly sweet food a lot more than just about anywhere I've ever been on Earth.

The same brands and foods will be made with cheap corn syrup in America that is sweeter and worse for you than a smaller amount of cane sugar that is used in the same product elsewhere. Kit kats are a great example. American kit kats suck and are wayyyy sweeter than the ones I've had in Europe and Asia.

And serving sizes! In Asia you buy a soda and it comes in a small cup. In America, not only is the cup huge but the waitress will likely keep giving you free refills. Honestly, drinking even just 16 oz of soda is so unbelievably bad for you and some people drink way more than that every day. And then they want to blame their politicans when their unhealthy ass ends up on a ventilator in a hospital bed because their lifestyle caught up with them. Blaming others for not taking covid seriously enough, but claiming no responsibility for treating their own body like a trash can for years.

America did so poorly on covid largely because this country is full of soft, plump people who haven't seen their toes in years. Nobody deserves to die and being fat doesn't make you a bad person, but the fact that we aren't even talking about this in the wake of the pandemic says we are just going to keep getting less healthy which is infuriating.",t2_golephkf,Lil_Phantoms_Lawyer,1,1648995641.0,0,t1_i384zld,i384zld,False,byzvntine,t3_tv7wm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/tv7wm1/aliquippa_junior_senior_high_school_enforcing/,Aliquippa Junior Senior High School enforcing limits on snacks,/r/pittsburgh/comments/tv7wm1/aliquippa_junior_senior_high_school_enforcing/i384zld/,-2,r/pittsburgh,0,-2

"With a few exceptions, if you're old enough to be on Carson Street, you're already too old to be on Carson Street. 

I lived on the ""quiet"" side of Carson (between 5th and 6th) when I was 24-27. 

Parking was a little easier than 14-20th, but still not great. I got dinged and keyed a few times (along with most of my neighbors). 

The South Side has a good portion (probably a majority) of the city's unhoused population. I've not had many bad experiences but I have friends who get nervous around men asking them for money. 

People will urinate and defecate on/near/behind your car on/near Carson. It usually won't be an unhoused person.

Unless you are 21, love to get blasted every night, and work an off hour job, I wouldn't recommend it. Plus if the place is above a restaurant or bar then you are 100% guaranteed to have roaches and smells in the apartment.  In the 10 years, my side car window got broken twice.

"It started with the pandemic.  

The lines at Chik-fil-a have always been long, but it got way worse when the pandemic hit and everyone was doing exclusively drive-thru.   The lines were snaking around the plaza and disrupting all the other shops, so they setup the snaking queues that are still in place.

I will say that for as busy as they get, they're impressively efficient.  Putting employees out in little huts in the parking lot to take orders on tablets, so that the food will already be ready by the time you pull around.  Doing double-lines for efficiency.  

It was recently announced that the Taco Bell next door will be moving to a new plaza being constructed down the road.  This is pure speculation on my part, but makes me wonder if they're going to demolish to give Chik-fil-a it's own larger footprint.",t2_97y6q,Excelius,0,1648954018.0,0,t1_i36ep6q,i36ep6q,False,scamden66,t3_tumbvo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/tumbvo/monroeville_chick_fil_a_trapping_customers_in/,Monroeville Chick Fil A trapping customers in bizzare parking lot configuration!,/r/pittsburgh/comments/tumbvo/monroeville_chick_fil_a_trapping_customers_in/i36ep6q/,10,r/pittsburgh,0,10

"The mentality is because the grass is almost never greener, at least not for long if it is at all. Particularly for working class jobs. Changing jobs once the current one becomes too unbearable means you never accumulate vacation. Plus, folks always say about immigrants ""why don't they stay in their own country and fight"" but those folks are also often staunchly against unions. On top of that, we might like what we do, but hate the working conditions. I work in a particularly niche industry of water treatment. There are not a lot of other options in the region. Eventually I'd have to change cities if I job hop every time a shitty employer wears me out.            
          
Now, my industry is heavily unionized and for good reason. I get pretty great pay and benefits and can genuinely say this is a """"""middle class"""""" job, though barely particularly if we have a family. But hey, I'm doing better than many, so I can't complain too loud.        
       
Without a union, I'd be making what my non union brethren make which is $15-$20 per hour with fewer benefits.         
      
Along with this, it offers job security. Yeah, people whine about ""lazy union workers being protected by the union,"" which admittedly does happen but it's rarer than the anti-union people think. Non union jobs, you can be fired just because the boss doesn't like you, provided it's not for one of the few illegal reasons. Unions typically enforce a ""just cause"" reason with progressive discipline and ways to grieve what may be seen as unfair treatment. There's always the same way to handle this stuff, with necessary evidence. Procedures so everyone gets treated the same. Of course, managers are lazy a lot of the time. So they have to uphold their end of the bargain to terminate people. They often don't want to do this, and whine instead.               
             
Some other perks are instead of you specifically confronting management alone, the union can do it to prevent retaliation. All of our voices are bigger together. We pool money in the union through dues to pay for things like labor attorneys. Unfair labor practices apply to non union people too, but it's harder to fight those on your own.           
         
And no, just because you're a model employee doesn't mean you're safe. At my last job (that I left amicably, not because of this reason) I was targeted for a reason I still don't know, but I think a backstabbing rat who felt threatened by a hard working young guy was saying shit about me that was untrue. I showed up on time and did my job very well, but I was still kind of new and learning my job and finding my place. The union protected me as the accusations were unfounded and had zero evidence.             
         
Unfortunately some old timers sell out the future generations while they get grandfathered in, but the only way to prevent this is by getting involved in your union. Young people can oust the old timer local officers if they get involved and get the votes.

He in fact defended his actions with the fact that the man in question is now in jail, which is to me even worse than the initial incident, as the fact that the guy is in jail now has \*nothing\* whatsoever to do with what happened on the day in question. Using it as a defense implies that it is okay to hold someone at gunpoint if you ‘know’ they will commit a crime later even if they haven’t done it now. That gets people killed. It implies that some people are just going to be criminals - that gets people killed and also supports discriminatory attitudes, policies, and behaviors.

"This is a complete misstatement  of the problem. No kill shelters are not a scam, and you absolutely 100% should not SURRENDER YOUR DOG to a kill shelter unless you're cool with them being killed. The problem is when people are ADOPTING and they are told to avoid kill shelters because they are ""bad."" Kill shelters are usually the government owned facilities that are forced to take any and all dogs. It's GOOD to adopt from kill shelters but absolute pure and utter NONSENSE to direct people who are surrendering dogs to a kill shelter. Good lord. Luckily HAR and animal friends are not kill shelters, so this post doesn't even make sense?

Also, kill shelters and rescues partner and work together to save dogs. No-kill rescues are able to pull dogs out of kill shelters before their time runs out. They all help the community. The only problem is when potential adopters avoid kill shelters because they think they are bad. They aren't bad. They do their best.

"Hi, I've worked at HARP. If the husky isn't yours you won't be able to surrender it. Only the owner can do that. You may be able to call ahead and get permission from the owner to surrender, but I'm not sure if that will work. Even if you were to get possession of the dog, you need some proof of ownership in order to surrender, such as vet bills. 

The only other way to get this dog out of a bad situation would be animal control, but honestly they're pretty useless and will only take a dog if it is outside without ""proper"" shelter and water. 

Also, I totally agree with the other poster about ""no kill"" shelters and rescues. They aren't all they're cracked up to be and can absolutely cause more harm than good. PETA propaganda has made us think ""kill"" shelters are murderous slaughterhouses but that's not always the case.

"Ok.... so I remember first coming across this legend on a random blog that was more conspiracy littered than actual historical proof.  The next time I heard about it was on the Pittsburgh Oddcast. Everytime you try to find more info on it you basically hit a damn wall. Thats one of the reasons you dont hear about it. Im not denying it may be possible, though I'm not sure about the 9ft claim, but there could have been a taller than average group of people living around here. Maybe there was an extended family with a tall gene or genetic condition that caused it. Anyways heres a few counter points to it.


A. I want to also let you know that native Americans around the time of european NA settlement through the wild west days were on average taller than the Europeans and the early americans. some tribes were very close to the average height we have today. [SOURCE](https://www.livingplaces.com/PA/Pennsylvania_Indians.html).

B. Tall people legends are a thing not only known native american tribal legends, but almost in every other civilization thats existed. The Lenapi alone had a few different tall people legends. Maybe they told the early settlers the stories in hopes of keeping them out or scaring the kids.  [SOURCE](http://www.native-languages.org/legends-giants.htm)

C. Not much evidence left of it. The bones were lost. There were no pictures of the display or the skeleton put together. The one find was a few measurements from 
 bones pulled from a pile of bones.



So basically its hard to verify it 100%. The fact that we have people today who are extraordinarily tall means we shouldnt say its absolutely fake. Just that with the lack of records and proof we can maybe safely assume that there were a few 7ft to 8ft tall max people that did live here. And the fact that different tribes would assimilate captives into their own tribes its not hard to rule out there maybe have been a family with a tall gene who every couple generations produced a way taller than average human.

Edit: I want to add because I am a firm believer that oral legend typically has a base in reality. It doesnt mean there was a whole group of tall native americans. Maybe there were two groups who met and the one tribe sent their tallest warriors as a show of force and to intimidate. This is not unheard of and we can find this happening a lot up to recent history(cough, Napoleans prussian guard[see potsdam giants], cough). And as legend was passed down those 7ft dudes turned into 9ft giants.",t2_kskhk,jetsetninjacat,0,1648878647.0,0,t1_i32u6ho,i32u6ho,False,oddpittsburgh,t3_tu24rv,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/tu24rv/hes_continuing_to_make_mysterious_and_fascinating/,He's continuing to make mysterious and fascinating history in the North Hills...,/r/pittsburgh/comments/tu24rv/hes_continuing_to_make_mysterious_and_fascinating/i32u6ho/,4,r/pittsburgh,0,4

"“They were apparently a race of gigantic people who once roamed around Western Pennsylvania, according to the Delaware Lenni Lenape. When their people first came to Western Pennsylvania, it was already inhabited by these tall people,” Mr. Schalcosky said.

The tale was confirmed during a 1921 University of Pittsburgh archaeological dig in Verona when researchers came across two skeletons that were 9 feet tall. Another dig in South Park found 42 skeletons, two of which were very tall, as were skeletons found in North Park in the 1940s, he said.

“This legend of the Allegewes: I was like, 'What? How can that even be possible that there were 9-foot-tall people roaming around here?’”

"**[Magic Roundabout (Swindon)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Roundabout_\(Swindon\))** 
 
 >The Magic Roundabout in Swindon, England, is a ring junction constructed in 1972 consisting of five mini-roundabouts arranged in a circle. Located near the County Ground, home of Swindon Town F.C., its name comes from the popular children's television series The Magic Roundabout. In 2009 it was voted the fourth-scariest junction in Britain.
