 Then if you spend those on drugs or booze there's soup kitchens and pantries in many areas. Free food everywhere.

Corner Bar in Ferndale has Axe Throwing (I promise not all suggestions will have axe throwing) and a pretty excellent board game selection.

The Music Theater has stuff going on all the time and a comedy show or something. Looks like tonight's show is cancelled but for next time it might be something to do. 

There's The Great Escape Room downtown.

"From last night's meeting, it's pretty clear that the issue here is neither anybody looking down on a vocational school, nor a greedy council looking to install a business at whatever cost.

Fundamentally and statistically, opening a dispensary in this location is not a threat to the students at OSTC. Any ""think of the children!"" emotional arguments are not based in fact.

The issue here is one of zoning. The city marijuana ordinance tied the Planning Commission's hands in requiring them to only place these marijuana retail businesses in industrial zones. That area on Meijer Dr. is clearly industrial zoned land, meaning there never should be a school there in the first place. However, OSTC was built half a century ago and was grandfathered into the city plan (it's a county school....RO has no say in what and where it can be). This led to confusion in the Planning Committee, so when Gatsby presented their application to utilize the vacant autobody shop there, it ticked all the boxes required and made it to last night's meeting, where it was denied.

Frankly, the Planning Committee should have red flagged this immediately. Letting it become a circus is now making the entire RO marijuana retail program - one that is supported by 70%+ of residents - in a bind. This was a completely avoidable shitshow. There's a school 88ft away. Sorry, pick a different piece of land. 

While I agree that OSTC's non-conforming zone designation should preclude it from technically counting in the 1,000ft statute of the MI state law - and there is legal basis to support this - I also agree that the council isn't in a position to allow the plan to move forward until either the state clarifies the law or the city takes a separate measure to either amend the zoning or amend the ordinance clause with the 1,000ft distance requirement. The city is already facing 2 lawsuits against this site, and now after voting no, will be facing a third from Gatsby Cannabis.....so it's safe to say that there's no right answer here for the city.

Just want to clarify the *actual* issue around this proposal and hopefully bring some common sense and clarity to a situation that, based on last night's hours of commentary, is poorly understood and highly emotional.

PS: If your kids go to OSTC, ROHS, or any other high school......buying marijuana from the dispensary next door would be prohibitively difficult and expensive compared to the dealer just a few lockers down the hall!",t2_2gdsj8zi,stealthblaumer,0,1644431098.0,0,t1_hw98xry,hw98xry,True,[deleted],t3_so0o51,https://www.reddit.com/r/royaloak/comments/so0o51/gatsby_cannbis_co_aims_to_open_dispensary_across/,Gatsby Cannbis Co. aims to open dispensary across from Royal Oak school amid opposition,/r/royaloak/comments/so0o51/gatsby_cannbis_co_aims_to_open_dispensary_across/hw98xry/,6,r/royaloak,0,6

"While I think the MetroTimes article touches on the rationale for opposition, they really miss the mark on the issue at hand with the RO Planning Commision.  Michigan State Law prohibits a marijuana establishment from operating within 1000 feet of a pre-existing public or private school K-12.  City of Royal Oak administrators are taking a position that because the OSTC-SE campus is a ""vocational"" program it is NOT considered a K-12 school!  This position would be a comedy if not so sad being that every student attending this vocation school uses attendance of this program as a requirement for HS Graduation.

"When I was house hunting I did look at a newly constructed house that was built next to the tracks (over near the Webster ave crossing).  I don't remember going outside to listen for any buzzing sounds, but those big electrical towers looming over the yard less than 60-100 feet from the back door definitely creeped me out.

"Thank you - this was a very interesting read. I'm sorely disappointed, but not surprised that Royal Oak would okay this building to be installed and let this clearly predatory and shady business take advantage of the city's young people.

OCC is right there and has been the go to community college for so many students in the area for decades. Although I've had my frustrations with them, they are way better than whatever Baker is pretending to be. My associate's barely cost me 10k (and that's including the additional loans I took for books, supplies, and other school related expenses that come with switching to an online format). (EDIT: I also received pell grants, so this may not apply to all students.)

To read that some poor soul spent close to six figures on two associate's was so disappointing and disheartening.

"I love Madison Heights. When I lived in a two-year lease in Royal Oak, I was paying Royal Oak rent for a house on the Madison Heights border. Without kids and a school district to worry about, I was wasting money. After that, I did another two year lease in Southfield but on the Berkley border. Last year, I bought my house in Madison Heights.

A lot of people lean towards Royal Oak and Ferndale because of their schools, but I honestly love the Madison Heights school district so far, although my kids are very young. Oakland County is school of choice, so if school district is important, there is always the option to send kids to a different school.

Madison Heights is where all the good shopping is. When I lived in Southfield, I still found myself driving the extra distance to shop in Madison Heights. Living in Oak Park and Hazel Park, you'd probably do the same.

Oak Park is kinda hip, especially on the Ferndale side, and it would be my second choice of the three. It's also a big Jewish community with lots of orthodox Jews about, which might be a turnoff for some people, but I thought it was cool to see.

Hazel Park is referred to as Hazeltucky and has a reputation for being sort of white trash. I live in south Madison Heights near the border and I can kind of see that in a few of my neighbors, but overall, the cheaper housing makes my area well worth it. People have been saying Hazel Park is going to turn into another Ferndale for the last few years, but that hasn't happened yet and I wouldn't hold my breath.

"Bham is fab and welcome!!!!

Trash is the city and recycling bins are issued to you upon request

Electric is DTE, gas is Consumers 

Comcast is your primary cable - WOW is also available on most streets (but there’s some gaps). Xfinity is the best bet for WiFi.

Birmingham is a remarkable community with so much to offer. 

Check out Toast for dinner, Dick O’ Dows for libations , and Cannelle for coffee and pastries.

If you’re in the Rail district - Griffinclaw and Big Rock are excellent.

If you’re over by Pierce and downtown - walk the 20’minutes through suburban Heaven to the oasis that is downtown. 

Winter is coming - make sure to hit the hills with your sled at Lincoln Hills golf course or skate at the rink on Eton. Quart on Lake is a great place to feed duck and skate when it freezes over

If you have kids -  swimming lessons from Goldfish or the YMCA. The local junior league is still active for women wanting to volunteer.

"Eyep! I've lived here about 10 years now and have used city hall and the police station numerous times. Both have been endlessly helpful and friendly whenever I needed to use them. 

The reason for city hall being demolished was because if they kept the old city hall, they'd be knocking on my door for 10k instead. The old building was in *bad* shape, with frequent flooding and out of date HVAC that cost a fortune to run. The numbers were run, and it was just cheaper to build a more modern city hall than bring the old one up to date.  

The police station was more practical though, it was also out of date too. But why not just move it next to courthouse? That way we can unbury the library and put in a large public park in downtown for people to use.

My only complaint is because I have IBS and there's no public restrooms in any of these plans. So I'm kinda SOL unless the library is open, hah.

As for why I didn't address the parking decks... I don't use them, I can't drive. I moved here *specifically* because it's a bikable community.

"No.  Wife was interested so we took a peek, but once they said ""just an fyi, offers are due..."" we ran the other way.  Getting into a bidding war so you can only throw more money at a home makes little sense.  Also ran a permit check and saw nothing for the kitchen remodel (they installed new lighting; I'd assume they had to put drywall in the kitchen to accomplish that or they got really creative; ? if they did plumbing work.  Things not being permitted is a red flag in my book - doesn't mean it wasn't, made it wasn't uploaded, someone from the city could come take a look, etc)

"Hey OP, if you’re still looking at Royal Oak and considering Amber Apartments, I’d advise that you check their listings/availability daily. It’s updated every few hours/about every day.

And be sure to fill out their application first (it’s free) so that when you spot an apartment you want on their site, you can get it. I missed out on one apartment listing because I did not have an application filled out, so they wouldn’t let me apply/tour without it. Someone else ended up renting it (I ended up finding another apartment through them though, so I’m happy).

"It's my understanding that you notify the landlord in writing. Keep a copy. In the letter, you explain that if the problem is not resolved in a timely matter, you will be withholding rent. Take pictures of the flooding. You must take your rent payment and put it in a separate bank account (I think it may be called escrow). If the problem is resolved, you withdraw the back rent from the account and pay up. If not, keep adding your rent to the account. If you get to the end of your lease agreement date and the problem has not been resolved, you can move out and take your back rent with you. You keep the bank statement showing you were willing and able to pay the rent if the landlord would've fixed the problem. If the landlord tries to evict you or sue you for the rent, you have the notice letter, pictures of the problem, and the bank statement. Withholding the rent motivates the landlord to fix the problem. If you just keep paying and complaining, the landlord has no incentive to fix it quickly. It also may be too expensive to fix and he'll just keep renting it out to unsuspecting tenants. If he doesn't fix it and you have to live with a soggy floor, at least it will be rent free. I'm not a lawyer so you should check with the city to see if this is how to proceed. Someone else may also post a more correct answer.

"> city commission would have listened to all parties instead of charging ahead with this and making this horrifically political.

As far as I can tell, the city commission didn't do that.  There was tons of public engagement on the new park design - public input sessions, online surveys, etc.  I know I filled out at least 1 survey that specifically asked about thoughts on moving the memorial.  As far as I can tell the plans for the park were finalized and then a group that felt that what they wanted was not in the final plan started all of this.  

And the part that I find most concerning from the proposed ordnance language is that if approved, the Plaza will be ""designated for continued and exclusive use as a memorial . . . and any other uses are prohibited.""  That ""any other uses prohibited"" technically means that the huge segment of the park would not be able to be used for other events.

"OK, someone please correct me if my understanding is wrong:

the city ordinance that was passed when the memorial was moved to the ""current"" location  (i know it already is removed) stated that the memorial could not move outside of that rectangle in the image. so the park designed the new location based on that requirement, and moved it away from a busier area, surrounded it was trees, and even made it more accessible, since there is access from both sides and an actual walkway (before looking at Google satellite just now, i never realized there was a walkway from the old parking lot, since I'm usually coming in from the farmers market side).

"I’m copying this over from the RO Facebook group. I wanted to make sure as many people could see it as possible. I am NOT the op of the Facebook post. 

This graphic illustrates the 0.44 acre area of the park, including the Star Dream Fountain, that will be off limits for public or recreational use if the ""Save the Veterans Monuments"" ordinance is approved by the voters on November 2. This area was named the Barbara Hallman Memorial Plaza and dedicated by the city for ""recreation and public use"" in 1997. In 2007, the veteran monuments were moved into the Plaza close to the Fountain and the area was further ""designated for continued use as a memorial"". The recreation/public use wasn't eliminated, so uses like Library story hours and concerts continued. The proposed ordinance, however, says that if approved, the Plaza will be ""designated for continued and exclusive use as a memorial . . . and any other uses are prohibited."" The city attorney confirms that this means no activities here whatsoever except for those like Memorial Day services. If you think the public should have full use of 100% of the park, vote NO or AGAINST the ordinance. If you like the idea of the restricted use, vote to approve.",t2_ifnxo,feinting_goat,0,1632260234.0,0,t1_hdrpnmx,hdrpnmx,True,feinting_goat,t3_psspu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/royaloak/comments/psspu2/upcoming_elections_issue_what_does_save_the/,Upcoming elections issue.
