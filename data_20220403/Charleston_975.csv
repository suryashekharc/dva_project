"1. Certain parts of Charleston are bike-friendly, but not most of it.
2. There are no good grocery stores in Charleston downtown. The closest ones are in Kanawha City and the West Side (both Kroger). There is an Aldi in Dunbar and another one on Corridor G in the Southridge Center. The ""Gucci"" Kroger is along Corridor G in the Ashton Place shopping plaza.
3. Yes! Elephant Thai in South Charleston, Chow Thai on Shrewsbury Street are both good. For Indian food, Nawab right at the foot of the 35th street bridge in Kanawha City is really good. Sitar of India is less good but still very decent.
4. Downtown is actually quite walkable, especially around Capitol Street. That is the best street by far for walking and eating various things, but you can also walk on Summers Street, etc. The movie theater is right across from the BB&T building near the corner of Summers and Washington Streets. You could easily park in the garage there, take in a movie, go walk to get food and shop/hang at Taylor Books, then walk back to your car. If you go in the afternoon, the parking will be free after 6 p.m. once you get finished!
5. All hikes are going to be a drive. Kanawha State Forest is the closest good bet, and you can also bicycle once you get there.

ETA: I am seeing MULTIPLE people called the West Side the West End. That is not correct. It is the West Side and the East End. Does it make sense? No. Is that how it is correctly ID'd? Yes.

ETA 2: Kanawha City is part of Charleston.

"> Do they have some good thai and indian restaurants?   

Inside of Charleston there is Chow Thai and Sitar of India.  Both excellent!  In Kanawha City, you have the option of Nawab.  In South Charleston there's Elephant Thai.   

Lots of other super good local restaurants.  Black Sheep Burrito has a vindaloo burrito that i love!  Adelphia, Ichiban, Sams Downtown Cafe, Recovery Sports Bar .. All downtown    

> Are there good grocery stores in the city?   

You need to clarify a better idea of where you'll be staying.   Most of what we have here in Charleston is Kroger, Piggly Wiggly, and Aldi in Dunbar and Southridge.  Walmart is also in Southridge.  You CAN ride your bike along Corridor G (119 that takes you from the river to Southridge shopping center) but i would strongly advise against it.  There's also a Dollar General and Family Dollar around every corner for quick trips.   

> From what i've seen the downtown area looks really picturesque and nice (google street view). Is it fairly safe and walkable? Is April a good time to be out walking/riding weather-wise?    

April is kind of a coin toss.  Probably have a better idea in March as to how we think the weather will turn out the following month.   Overall it's usually decent temps but it can be really rainy.  Safety...  there's usually a lot of police patrolling which is helpful.  We do have a large homeless population.  You're going to see people sleeping on benches and in doorways.  Lock your bike up.  If you have a backpack, don't let it out of your hands.  Otherwise, as a woman, as long as I'm staying vigilant and avoiding dark alleys and the like, i don't feel anymore unsafe downtown than anywhere else.   

>  How accessible / far away are some good hikes?    

There's Carriage Trail by the Amtrak across the Southside bridge downtown.  
You are also a short drive from Kanawha State Forest and Coonskin Park.  Make sure your GPS takes you up 79 to Coonskin.  Sometimes it thinks you can still go up Greenbrier but the National Guard base is blocking that access now.  
I think Cato Park also has some short hiking trails.

"Welcome to West Virginia. I think you’ll enjoy April in Charleston. It’s a pretty month in the mountains. Be sure to explore some of our cultural stuff, too, like the WV Culture Center at the Capitol Complex.  You’ve got good answers for most of your questions, but I’d like to add that there are excellent hiking trails near Charleston other than at Kanawha State Forest and Coonskin Park. 

I recommend Little Creek Park off Kanawha Turnpike near Spring Hill. It’s easily accessible by bike and has some excellent trails. I also hike quite a bit at WineCellar Park near Dunbar — get upon the ridge trails above the fishing lake. There’s also a newer hiking experience at Forks of Coal Wildlife area off Corridor G just before the Lincoln county line. 

Some of these are a bit of a distance, but no farther away than Kanawha State Forest (all less than 10-15 miles from Charleston proper.)",t2_aip8jrop,MuttinMT,0,1643494689.0,0,t1_hurw5m4,hurw5m4,True,Excelsior_Airlines,t3_sfo43s,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/sfo43s/housesitting_in_charleston_in_april_questions/,Housesitting in Charleston in April - Questions,/r/charlestonwv/comments/sfo43s/housesitting_in_charleston_in_april_questions/hurw5m4/,2,r/charlestonwv,0,2

"As Dan-in-SC said, in completely depends where in the city you are.

1. Most streets downtown and near the Capitol are fine for biking. The residential streets of Kanawha city are fine for biking. You'd mostly be safe from cars biking in the east end or west end, but not the people (crime). And if you're in Edgewood, South Hills, Hillsdale, you need to be a Tour de France level competitor to bike those steep roads.

2. Not really. There's nothing like a Trader Joe's, Whole Paycheck, or Aldi's. The best store according to many is the Kroger in South Hill. Not sure if you have a Kroger near you (a large, but regional, chain) but they are a standard mid-tier grocery store. They have a couple more locations and there's a few Piggly Wigglys, which aren't quite as nice as Kroger.

3. I'd have to defer on this question. Never been an Indian or Thai food fan. But I will say, there is some good local cuisine downtown and in Elk City.

4. As with biking, downtown is safe. Once you cross the Elk River, you can walk a couple blocks west but then you get into the West End. And as long as you stick to Kanawha Boulevard or Virginia St, you can walk all the way to the Capitol. But as you go north of Quarrier and east of Morris St, you get into the East End.

5. There's plenty of great hikes nearby. Coonskin Park is a gem. There's also Cato Park in Edgewood which has a few trails. There's a trail know as the Sunrise Carriage Trail in South Hills. And a few miles out of the city is Kanawha State Forest, which is a large state park like area.",t2_burjr,eaglescout1984,0,1643486802.0,0,t1_hurde6q,hurde6q,True,Excelsior_Airlines,t3_sfo43s,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/sfo43s/housesitting_in_charleston_in_april_questions/,Housesitting in Charleston in April - Questions,/r/charlestonwv/comments/sfo43s/housesitting_in_charleston_in_april_questions/hurde6q/,2,r/charlestonwv,0,2
"1.) Like another poster said, it depends on where you are. If you’re “in the city” (i.e., the West Side or East End), then it’s pretty walkable. Kana what Boulevard has a nice biking/walking path all the way down the river for about 5 miles. There are two grocery stores in the West Side/slightly North Charleston—Kroger and Piggly Wiggly. Don’t bike or walk there late. For the most part, it’s inadvisable to be out biking or walking late in the West Side, Downtown, or East End though this obviously is nuanced. Most stores are in Southridge which, while theoretically bikeable, it’s about 5 miles out of town through the mountains. I wouldn’t advise biking in South Hill, there are often no sidewalks and narrow roads on the edge of ravines. 

2.) Depends on what your definition is. We have an Aldi and Target in Southridge. The Walmarts are always packed and generally just a horrible experience. The Kroger in Ashton Place is very nice all around. The Kroger in Kanawha City I think has also been remodeled and offer more “modern” brands. 

3.) Good Thai: my favorite is Thai Elephant in South Charleston. There’s also Chow Thai downtown which I like as a close second. I think there’s more but I haven’t been too attentive recently. Indian: my favorite is Nawab. Sitar is good but I definitely think Nawab beats them. There used to be Little India on the East End but I think it closed during the pandemic.

4.) Like I said before, stick for the most part to Capitol, Summers, and the surrounding areas of the Boulevard at night if you’re new so you can get a feel of everything. I’m not sure how the transit mall is (bordering Summer Street) now, but last I checked they were redoing it and building a police substation because that area is pretty bad. Charleston is a, for the most part, a wealthier area of WV but that’s not to say it’s wealthy. We have a massive homeless population as well. They’re not dangerous (again, for the most part), but do keep in mind your surroundings. Like don’t go sightseeing in the West Side, or the projects in certain areas or the northern area of the East End. Charleston is very beautiful, but just be aware of where you are and feel the vibe of the area.

5.) One of the good things about Charleston is that it’s right by Kanawha State Forest. I would bike there, but it’s close. There’s tons of nice hiking and mountain biking trails. It’s about 15 minutes out of downtown via car. If you want even better hiking and views, the New River Gorge and all surrounding areas of the national park are about 50 minutes to an hour outside of Charleston!",t2_dto88ir4,notesfromnothing,0,1643486792.0,0,t1_hurdda9,hurdda9,True,Excelsior_Airlines,t3_sfo43s,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/sfo43s/housesitting_in_charleston_in_april_questions/,Housesitting in Charleston in April - Questions,/r/charlestonwv/comments/sfo43s/housesitting_in_charleston_in_april_questions/hurdda9/,5,r/charlestonwv,0,5

"1.  Some of the roads have dedicated bike lanes, but most don't.  In the areas that don't, I've never had an issue just riding mine on the sidewalks.

2.  Capitol Market I think would be your best bet for groceries if you want to take your bike.  I personally do almost all of my shopping on Corridor G, and that would be really sketchy to take a bike to I imagine.

3.  For Thai and Indian you have a few choices, Elephant Thai in South Charleston I really enjoy, and Sitar of India is one on my list of places I would like to try.

4.  I think downtown is fairly nice, and April should be good walking / riding weather.  Capitol Street has a lot of cool places to visit and good places to eat as well, that's where I usually go walking.

5.  Hiking is something I personally don't have a lot of experience with, but Kanawha State Forest should have multiple trails and isn't too far of a drive from Charleston.

I only ride my bike very close to where I live (South Charleston,) so just throwing that out.  If I'm wrong on the bike info hopefully someone can correct me.  Also as an added bonus since you're dog sitting, Joplin Park has a dog park inside of it.

The heart of downtown (between Town Center and Capitol street and up to the boulevard) is safe and walkable (although there can be some sketchy people at the bus station).

Importantly to me, and probably to you, there's some free things to do. There's sidewalks all through the main part of town, so you can walk for hours. There's a free gym. (Some of the equipment is a little wonky, but hey- totally free.) There's a free summer concert series on the river. Depending on where in Charleston your parents live, you can be at different hiking areas in under an hour if you have a car. If you happen to own golf clubs, there's a free course right now and has been for a few years. (It's a little wonky, too, but- again, free.) There's a great board game store with a massive library of games in the back that you can play for free (they sell snacks and beer so it'd be polite to buy some but they are friendly either way.) You'll probably be able to get a job easily with what you want to do. I've heard the social workers are really overworked and underpaid, but I also suspect that's a problem most anywhere.

"One thing you need to understand about WV and especially Charleston….  There are a lot of whiners here, particularly among the Reddit community.    Having lived in several states and different sized towns, CRW isn’t too bad.  We have the same issues any other decent sized town has these days - no doubt about it.  But all in all this is a nice place to live.    As others have commented your skill sets are in demand here.   WV is a beautiful place and the whole state is easily accessible from CRW.   Folks with good attitudes and solid work ethics can thrive here.   We have a good arts and music scene, world class outdoor recreation close by, and enough diversity in CRW that folks are generally accepting of all types.

Dinner: Noah's or Hale House. Great food at a relative bargain if you're accustomed to higher cost of living areas

Beer: Not a big craft beer scene but Pies and Pints has a selection and Black Sheep Burrito brews their own.  (good burritos there too, obviously) For bottles/cans, go to the Capitol Market (see below)

Wine, Tapas: The Block. Pretty classy place.

Booze: Mountain State Distillery

Sports bar: Recovery Sports Grill is fun especially if there's a WVU game. There's a few other bars around that I haven't had the pleasure of checking out yet myself.

Morning after breakfast: First Watch

Shopping: Capitol Market is the top quality groceries place in town, there's some stands for food you can eat on site as well. For local hipster WV decor and apparel you can go to Kin Ship in the west side/elk city. But there’s not much else over there 

Tourism: Check out the State Capitol/State museum. Haddad Riverfront Park along the river is pleasant. The Carriage Trail is a light uphill walking path and there's nice views at the top. Kanawha State Park for more serious hiking.",t2_kj2en,MisterItcher,0,1640542129.0,0,t1_hq1rtiy,hq1rtiy,True,hesslerk,t3_rp1fdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/rp1fdm/alright_what_is_there_to_do_for_a_quick_overnight/,"Alright, what is there to do for a quick overnight in Charleston?

"In Charleston, Capitol Street might have some things you would be interested in, I asked about places to eat on here and multiple people suggested some places there.  Pies & Pints, The Block, and Ellens Ice Cream were all great.  They also have a little walking area set up with Christmas Trees decorated by businesses called Holly Jolly Brawley on Brawley Walkway.  There's a really nice bookstore on Capitol Street as well next to Pies & Pints.  The Clay Center is also a nice place to visit, has a lot of stuff geared towards kids but when I went there two years ago I had a decent bit of fun.  Went to an astronomy show in an atrium there then walked around and looked at some of their science showcases.

In South Charleston, D street has some fun places to visit and there's a little museum there.  Multiple nice restaurants to eat at depending on what you're looking for or like.  You also have the Criel Mound, everyone just calls it the mound though.  Has a little park like area around it and some informational signs if learning new things is something you like.  There's more nice places to eat further down in South Charleston as well, Sokolata is a Greek restaurant and really good.  If you are bringing any pets with you and the weather isn't too bad, Joplin Park is a good place to take them.  I take my dog there all the time when the weather's actually nice, has a double gated dog park in the shade.

If you want something more nature themed, you could visit Kanawha State Forest.

 Like other comments said, there's Kanawha State Forest and Carriage Trail as well.  And Coonskin Park is nearby.  

There's the Marriot and Marriot Courtyard downtown.  Courtyard is a bit further but not unwalkable to downtown.  Plus, there's always uber if it's too cold to walk back.  
Embassy Suites is right by the CTC (Charleston Town Center) and walking distance to Capital Street and lots of restaurants.  
Four Points Sheraton is right on the boulevard and easy walking distance to Capital Street as well.  
There's a Hampton Inn and Holiday Inn Express also by the Convention Center.  
There's a Ramada and Quality Suites and there's nothing really wrong with them.... but i'd try to get a room at one of the others first.  That Ramada has been about 5 different franchises in the last two years.

"Call Suddenlink, and if one call doesn't work, keep calling until you get a manager or someone who has a firm grasp of (1) English and (2) the problem.  Oh, and demand a refund, too.

I had the same issue, early Pandemic, along with my neighbors.  I lost service and had a service tech scheduled to come to my house three days later.  But, on day two, I see a service tech at the house next door.  I mask up, walk over and talk to the tech (from Georgia) and when I point out I don't have service, he's like ""ohhhh, that's why I can't get this to work.""  Other neighbors come out to the street and say they lost service and had a Suddenlink tech scheduled to come that evening, or the next morning, etc.  Turns out, nobody on the street had service, but Suddenlink's tech is so ancient, they couldn't figure that out.  They'd scheduled different techs for every house at different times. 

Anyway, this tech at my next-door-neighbor's house gets on the phone to see if he can put a ladder on the telephone pole to check the neighborhood's signal.  The answer: ""Nope.""  Turns out, the techs that Suddenlink hires to come to your house are not contracted to work on the poles.  They get paid only if they fix the problem in *your* house, and they can't fix the problems in anyone else's house.  I literally watched the tech beg to fix the problem and Suddenlink HQ wouldn't let him.

BTW, the Suddenlink tech was pissed, I'm assuming because he wasn't getting paid because he didn't fix my neighbor's problem.  He said to call and complain.  I did, but the phone-answerer said to ""be patient, a tech was coming to my house tomorrow evening!""  Three calls to Suddenlink later, I finally got a foreigner with both a brain and a grasp of English, and he called a manager.  Ten minutes later, they'd rebooted the system and the whole neighborhood had service again.

tl/dr: I fucking *hate* Suddenlink.  More than I hate Facebook.",t2_bawdf2gi,wvavenger,0,1636520357.0,0,t1_hk16uez,hk16uez,True,EnRaygedGw2,t3_qq79dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/qq79dh/suddenlink/,Suddenlink,/r/charlestonwv/comments/qq79dh/suddenlink/hk16uez/,1,r/charlestonwv,0,1

"If I’ve said it once, I’ve said it 100 times. Yes, WV housing prices are cheaper than the US average, but utilities cost much much more here and it starts to become a wash. Internet is 3x other states with no options, electricity is some of the highest on the east coast and goes up damn near every single year, trash collection is double other states. West Virginia American Water is asking for a 36% increase in water this year, if you didn’t know. For a poor state, WV is expensive to live in.

ATT and T-Mobile offer home options that run off their towers. Both of them are not great in the Charleston area. ATT is terrible. T-Mobile is okayish, but it is fairly slow. Frontier is godawful. If you love paying $60 a month for internet that doesn’t work at all, then that’s for you. Suddenlink is hands down the best, but it’s expensive and some of their plan has caps so you can’t stream with the cheaper plans. Expect to pay at least $100 per month for internet, and Suddenlink also has a fun habit of raising your bill every single month for no reason, so expect your bill to climb $20-$30 every year. Their customer service does not care, so don’t expect to complain and get it taken off. They will just straight up tell you to cancel then and go with another provider. 

I have a friend that just moved to Cleveland. Her electricity bill in WV was $250 every month. In Cleveland, her house is 1000 square feet larger, and her electricity, water, and internet all together is $250 per month with roughly the same housing prices as here.",t2_co9k57q,NewVelociraptor,0,1632835452.0,0,t1_helc6em,helc6em,True,Bigbaldcaucasian,t3_pwuqrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/pwuqrb/crazy_internet_prices/,Crazy Internet prices,/r/charlestonwv/comments/pwuqrb/crazy_internet_prices/helc6em/,5,r/charlestonwv,0,5

"Charleston may be difficult for you. There's a small cultural scene but there's not a whole lot going on. If you want to travel by car, Charleston may work since it's somewhat centrally located on the East Coast. There are a ton of well-educated, affluent people in Charleston but most don't tend to lean liberal and artsy. There are some liberal artsy people but you will find a lot of staunch Republicans. No breweries except the one attached to Black Sheep but it's not like a true brewery. I think there is one planning to open this year or next downtown. Fayetteville, like an hour away, has some decent breweries and one of my favorites, Weathered Ground is not too far from Charleston. The food scene is...not good. It's one of the main things I miss about living in NYC. There are a few decent restaurants like 1010 and  Chow Thai, but nothing really worth going out of your way for. As far as variety, not going to find a lot. People will swear up and down that some country cooking restaurant has the best food you will ever taste in your life and that is just not true. Do not listen to those people. If you do decide to move here, you'll want to live in South Hills, the East End, or the West Side (Watts Hill or Edgewood). You do not want to live outside of the city.

"I don’t think you can get Xfinity in Charleston. I think it’s just Frontier and Suddenlink, both heartily suck. Suddenlink is decent if you live in the city, but to run a powerful WFH setup, the cost is stupid. I have friends that live in another county  that both WFH and need an extremely fast connection and they pay like $300 a month for it. Mine is okayish most of the time and it’s $110 a month. One of the things you need to be aware of if you move here is WV is way more expensive than you think it’s going to be. Utilities here are higher than on much of the east coast and they ask for a raise every single year, for example, the main water company for the southern part of the state is asking for a 36% increase this year alone and they *just* got an increase. The electric company is asking for a 13% increase. The gas company just got a 4% increase. They all have monopolies, so you can’t go anywhere else.  Car insurance is much higher here because of the potholes and deer damage. Health insurance is *much* higher here because there are so many old/unhealthy people. Home insurance is higher here. Lots of properties need flood insurance, which is thousands a year.  

The Kanawha Valley area doesn’t have much of a microbrewery scene going on. It’s humid as fuck here, so if you hate that, you’re going to be miserable. It’s hot and humid all summer long. There’s also a reason Charleston real estate looks super reasonable. Anything on the west side of Charleston is not very nice, but it’s cheap. The east end of Charleston is also a touch shady.  Those neighborhoods are rough. The South Hills are nice, but expect to pay $250,000 plus.

"Having lived in both, I would suggest Morgantown over Charleston.  Morgantown is much more liberal and lively due to the college.  It’s a 1.5 hour drive from Pittsburgh, which is nice.  There are some wineries and breweries fairly close. The food is relatively good, though West Virginia in general is a food desert. I’m not sure of any advice for a buyer in either Charleston or Morgantown; I only have experience with renting.

Then again, considering where you’re from, I would say that the culture shock would be pretty rough.  I’ve lived in West Virginia my entire life and even going to a place like DC or Pittsburgh was a bit overwhelming at first.

"Well hello! Local Charly West ambassador here & here are my thoughts:

1) Ehhh kinda sorta maybe. The issue I see is you're going to have to get out of your comfort zone/not be a complete homebody in order to find your people here. And even so that can take time--> it's not unheard of for it to take 2 years to really feel connected to the community even WITHOUT a pandemic to contend with.

2) In Charleston probably not. I actually know a couple guys with long hair, and Charleston itself is decently blue (though my progressive heart would love more blues to move in!!)

3) Nightclubs??? What's that?? Okay but actually it's not my scene but I imagine you could find that in Huntington (about an hour away).

4) Microbreweries are starting to pop up over the state, and I already have a laundry list of people who would ADORE you for starting one here. As I've said before, one of my favorite quotes about Charleston is ""no one knows to tell you no""

5) Check out OctoberWest! 

6) We (sadly) do not. But you go 3ish hours north to Pittsburgh and you have a BIG Krampusnacht celebration.

7) Better than many expect but also lower your expectations. The pandemic has been hard on the restaurant industry as a whole, but many of our local places managed to still stay afloat. Check out Books & Brews, Gonzo Burger, Black Sheep, Pies & Pints, Sitar of India, Olive Tree, Island Rhythm, Dem 2 Brothers, Vandalia Co.... 

8) Humidity is noooooo joke. Was doing a 'easy' workout & didn't understand why I was dying, turns out it was 90% humidity. That being said nearly all houses have AC, and the storms blow the humidity out pretty often. But definitely prepare for humidity. We usually have a 2 week stretch in the 90s but not usually higher than that.

9) So this is kinda a loaded question bc the areas I want to tell you to avoid are the very same areas that need the investment of people moving to them. Lets just say when examining poverty on a congressional map with no lines, you can clearly see where the West Side is. 

10) I've been working with Nikki Marion and she's been both prompt & very understanding of working with a first time single buyer.

Can't help with the bonus q haha.

In re-reading what you said about the 5-8hr weekend drive, realize that by being in Charleston that means you could damn near get to NYC with your usual drive (technically its 8.5hrs away). Cities within 8 hrs include: Pittsburgh PA, Columbus OH, Cleveland OH, Cincinnati OH, Washington DC, Atlanta GA, Charleston SC, Nashville TN, Louisville KY, Charlotte NC , Chicago IL, etc. Charleston WV puts you in the middle of the east coast & all it has to offer, at the best price you can find on the east coast.

"As for the bonus question - Budget Tapes and Records has long been a pillar of the community for cloves and sundry ""smoking accessories.""

Local music scene is alright. If you want techno it might require a trip to Pitt (~4 hours). Makes for fun weekend trips, though techno is not why I go. For anybody saying ""Morgantown"" - you're basically there after driving from CRW. Baltimore and DC are also good weekend trips. The outdoor stuff is all around for the asking.

"I have lots of thoughts & here they are!!

Pros:  
  
Cost of living- though this is changing rapidly as so many people are moving here (glad y'all are coming but damn leave some starter homes for the rest of us!!).  
  
Community- Charleston is very much a '3-degrees of separation' town. I moved here after being gone nearly 15years, went to a church and ran into a 85yr old second cousin twice removed (my grandparent's cousin) who I didn't even know existed. So if you screw someone over, be prepared for the ENTIRE 'CITY' to know. But on the flipside, if you're a good person your name will get out there and everyone will like you.  
  
Nature- I'm an outdoorsy person and there is so much hiking, camping, kayaking, and SUPing within 30minutes of city center.  
  
Ease of getting things started- Many people have mentioned how the economy/area is faltering. I of all people won't deny that, but the flipside is everyone is so desperate for a change their open to a lot. A quote I heard when I first moved back was ""No one knows to tell you no"" and I feel like that's true. If you have an idea and are willing to put in the effort you'll likely find support.  
  
Cons:  
  
If you're single be prepared to drive up to 60miles to meet someone who really 'clicks' with you. My last partner lived 50-140miles away depending on what season it is (job is season dependent).  
  
Charleston is decently alcohol focused- most people meet at bars and most events have an alcohol focus. But as mentioned above, you can get other things started.  
  
Schools in WV are pretty abysmal, and the legislature is only cutting education further. In Charleston, if you're planning on having kids I'd suggest moving to the South Hills (best high school in the state)  
  
Charleston itself is pretty 'live and let live' though that doesn't translate to the rest of the state.

  
Overall things to keep in mind:  
  
WV people in general do not like brag-y people. So don't be rubbing the 6figure salary in people's faces- they'll judge you hard and that word will spread like wildfire.  
  
If you become a large fish here remember it's a small pond- the lawyers particularly fall into that trap a lot. Keep networking outside of this area, or else it's easy to rest on your laurels here while the world passes us by.  
  
The population of WV is aging- only Florida beats us for average age. This is both a pro and a con- it's harder to meet young people here BUT it also means a lot of jobs are opening as people retire. In my company, 30% of all workers are eligible for retirement in the next 5 years. I've been here just under 2 years and have already landed a promotion.

Charleston used to feel way more dangerous than it is now.  I've personally seen someone shot at on Capitol Street, but that was 30 years ago.

Downsides:  

Lack of upward mobility.  

Some culture, but not *enough*.

Economic future looks uncertain at best.  This is not a town (or state) poised for growth.  Things will likely get worse before they get better, as too many people in the state have to be dragged away from coal kicking and screaming.

If you're in the city proper, you'll run into all types, but it'll be tilted more toward professionals and progressives on one side of the city, and the poor side of town on the other side of the city.  Not unlike many cities I've lived in/near.  If you venture outside the city, you'll be in Trump 2024 territory in no time flat.

Insects:

Beware of ticks carrying Lyme.  Stink bugs can be bad.  Mosquitos and wasps can be bad depending on where you are specifically, and what you're used to.

"A lot of formerly 24-hour things have stopped since Covid.

1. McDonald's is still open 24 hours with a few holiday exceptions.
2. Walmart at Southridge is now open from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week. Some of the ""sub stores"" like the deli, auto care etc. have separate hours but you can find those via Google.
3. Kroger on the West Side and Kanawha City are 6 a.m. - 11 p.m. Ashton Place is 6 a.m. to midnight.
4. The Spring Street and Kanawha City Piggly Wigglys are both open until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. seven days a week. The one on Spring Street is open earlier most days than the one in Kanawha City. Their hours do not match so you'll have to make sure you know the hours for your nearest location.
5. The 7-Eleven near the state Capitol building on Washington Street is open 24 hours. It  has gas and a convenience store.
6. The IHOP in Kanawha City used to be 24 hours but just changed their hours to the following:

Wednesday	10:30AM–3AM

12. Taco Bell depends on the location, the one on the East End closes at midnight most days, but the two in Kanawha City close later than that. If you use the app you can find the hours for all locations near you.

13. Shoney's on the Boulevard used to have longer hours but now has limited hours and a limited menu along with their buffet:

Monday	11AM–9PM  
Tuesday	11AM–9PM

15. Wendy's really depends on location. Google or the app will be able to tell you the hours at the one nearest you. The one on the East End is usually open until 1 a.m.

16. Tudor's Biscuit World -- if you're out REALLY late to the point where it's morning, I think every Tudor's in the Valley opens at 5:30 a.m., seven days a week.

17. PIZZA OTHER THAN PIES AND PINTS:  Most of the pizza chains, including locally owned chain Husson's, close between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m on weekdays and between 11 p.m. and 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. Dine in is not available at some stores now so you'll want to check their website or call them to make sure.

There are some local rescues and rehoming groups on Facebook that may help you find the right new home for him if you don’t find someone here - Stepping Stones Canine Fosters and Rascals Rescue are two I’ve come across that look reasonable, though I can’t vouch for them since I don’t know them personally, and there’s always the Kanawha-Charleston Humane Association.

Even with that extreme architecture/venting the work area was hideously hot and the technicians who worked the floor were subjected to over 85F every day at the minimum.

"Charleston itself is NOT dying the way you mean, at least not at the speed you would have to worry about it. The state government is here and will remain here. What is really changing is how many people actually live in the city limits. Fewer people want to live ""in town"" and have opted to live in the ""metro area"" outside of town. There are at least 300,000 people in that area. Tons of them come to Charleston every day to work. Lunchtime food delivery isn't going anywhere. Evening food delivery will likely not go much lower than it already has. The people who tend to stay in the city are either too poor to get food delivered or rich enough to get it delivered as often as they want.

Charleston has a surprising amount to do, and if you are willing to drive a few hours, you can be at most of the best outdoor recreation in less than a day.

"I've been to many states at this point, doing this delivery things. There's a few factors that from an outsider makes WV prime market, specifically Charleston. Let me list them out and you tell me if I am looking at this the right way?

* Decent Restaurants 
* Small Footprint (seems like MOST orders I've seen are like MAX 7-8 miles from downtown)
* Generally middle age, older, or younger but moved to town for a good job
* Not that much to do so going out everynight isn't really a thing, but still enough to have fun.
* People who do order food are doing surprisingly well off, because of said job on previous point.
* Easy to navigate City
* Cost of living is so low that doing doordash as a needed thing in addition to full time employment to get by isn't really a thing.

"It's hard to suggest that a person move here. The town *is* dying. The state has politically fallen under the Trump spell. Sure it could get better, but it's hard to see how that will happen. 

That said, it's honestly not a terrible place to live at the moment. Almost anything that a bigger town has, Charleston has a surprisingly good, but smaller, version of it. It's fairly walkable and there is a mediocre, but fairly reliable, bus system. We have a minor league baseball team, a summer outdoor concert series, a few pretty cool places to eat, some cool bars / music venues, and the like. This is a surprisingly cosmopolitan and progressive little enclave within a sea of insane Trump cultists. Rents tend to be pretty manageable because so few people want to be here. 

It may sound weird to say it, but one of the cool things about Charleston is how easy it is to leave it and go somewhere else for the day. You can spend all day in Kanawha State Forest which is right next to town. You can be in Columbus in 2-3 hours, or in Huntington or Fayetteville within 1 hour. The airport isn't a major hub or anything, but there fights to various major destinations. There is even train service to Charleston. 

I don't have a lot of info about doordash and grubhub delivery. I personally never use these services because they are too expensive and I am just too poor to indulge myself. I know a lot of people who do though, but then again, with the population dropping like a stone, it doesn't seem like a sound basis for a good living to me. 

On the other hand, and in the interests of full disclosure, I am personally planning on leaving as soon as I finish my degree. I've had it with the political shift in this state, I hate the weather, and I am sick of wishing I was somewhere else. A person only lives so long so they should spend as little of it as possible settling for something that's just ok. All that's subjective though, and you what's meh to me might be amazing to you.",t2_6odiw,lordmacbayne,0,1625795326.0,0,t1_h4jl94y,h4jl94y,True,TheTobiasProject,t3_ofy57m,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/ofy57m/thinking_of_moving_to_charleston_need_advice/,"Thinking of moving to Charleston, need advice?",/r/charlestonwv/comments/ofy57m/thinking_of_moving_to_charleston_need_advice/h4jl94y/,1,r/charlestonwv,0,1

Walk both downtown (Capitol & Hale street) & 'elk city' (gentrified portion of the West Side)  to see cute shops & fun restaurants. I always tell people to hit up Taylor Books (one of my favorite places here). I second the recommendation of Black Sheep for food.

Capitol Market is the local farmers market & it's lovely! They also just installed a new 'What to Do in Charleston' interactive screen in the Capitol Market building which I thought was interesting.

"Depends on what you think is fun.

There's the state museum, which is free. You can tour the capitol grounds while you're there and maybe even the capitol (I haven't gone since before COVID, so not sure if the public is allowed yet).

For drinks, there's a few places downtown I'd recommend. Pies and Pints serves awesome pizza with craft beers. Black Sheep Burrito is a collaboration with Bad Shepherd brewing and serves modern Tex-Mex. Axes and Ales is an axe throwing venue (reservation highly recommend).

There's also a lot of beauty to check out. You could simply walk along the Kanawha River along Kanawha Boulevard. There's also the Sunrise Carriage Trail near the Southside Bridge. Kanawha State Forest is about a 15 minute drive. And if you don't mind driving a little further, you can follow US 60 east along the Kanawha River and check out Kanawha Falls (GPS routing is not recommended, you can put it in you map, but stay on US 60 until you get to the spot where the marker is in the river) and Cathedral Falls.",t2_burjr,eaglescout1984,0,1624728923.0,0,t1_h34jryu,h34jryu,True,Seratonement,t3_o8dc86,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/o8dc86/visiting_a_friend_in_charleston_for_the_weekend/,"Visiting a friend in Charleston for the weekend, what can we do for fun?",/r/charlestonwv/comments/o8dc86/visiting_a_friend_in_charleston_for_the_weekend/h34jryu/,5,r/charlestonwv,0,5

I will somewhat disagree with velociraptor in that I found folks to be friendly - when you’re in their presence but, like they said, it has been harder to make a friend. The upside to the smalltownedness is that if you have a niche hobby you will quickly meet all the movers and shakers in that area. I’m also a transplant but, from the Deep South where making friends is what we do.  I think you need to enjoy outdoor activities to be happy here.

"So what are you looking for? Like what are your interests? 

Charleston is a small city. I know you said you could get a job there, but be prepared to not make nearly as much as other states. One of the reasons WV loses population is because of extremely low pay. There are suburbs surrounding the city. It’s a nice area. There’s not a whole lot to do for activities outside of parks/hiking/shopping. You won’t get certain amenities here. There’s no Whole Foods or Trader Joe’s in the state. No Ikeas or large restaurants like Dave and Busters. The state is beautiful. I will warn you that the Kanawha Valley isn’t the friendliest area. I don’t mean intolerant, just not that friendly and you aren’t going to get the down home friendliness you might get in smaller areas. 

I will warn you the housing market is blazing hot right now and houses are getting rapidly more expensive in the area. Don’t look at list prices when you look at housing because they are closing much higher, especially in the Hurricane/Scott Depot/South Charleston area. I would strongly recommend you rent for a year before you buy to get a feel of the area and if you want to stay here.

"20 minutes north towards Ohio, is the kenna/ripley area... there are a few impoundment lakes in that area that are fun to fish/kayak. 

For music stores, if you are into vinyl... Elk City Records on the west side (elk city) has a lot of used stuff. It isnt bargain basement stuff.. He cleans, and sleeves his record, then prices them generally lower than Discogs.. but its not a thrift store by any means. Budge tapes and records has been a fixture in Kanawha City since Dinosaurs roamed the Earth. They have a bunch of dingy vinyl (can sometimes find a diamond in the rough, then new records as well... also sells bongs and shit like that. Sullivans on the east end may reopen one day. He suffered a hardship as we were entering into covid, and the store has been shuttered since then. I am hoping he reopens as vaccines have been rolling out. 

In regards to live music, I cant be much help there. 

Nitro has a bunch of antique shops, and there is the antique mall in South Charleston. These arent really cheap shops.. one thing you will learn about WV, is that we dont really sell anything cheap. Someone will stick a price tag on an object, and generally that is the price.. it will be that price untiil it rots. 

There are a few little cool places I like to get grub at Pho Vinh Long has good eat in Pho. Across the road from there is Yens Sandwich shop... They actually have (imo) better Pho, but only on Sundays. I will usually get theirs for takeout, as it is a small place. Around the corner from that is Elephant Thai which is really good as well. Very sweet people run that place. I would skip Happy Days Cafe. It is basically overpriced garbage (IMO). All of that is in South Charleston.

Another favorite place of mine, is The Grill on the west side (again Elk City) It is a greasy spoon, pretty dated, and a mom and pop place. I love their burgers and fries though. I would eat there 100 times over before going to Gonzo Burger (which is a few doors down). Cucina is a mexican place also in that same neighborhood. 

If you are into biking, there is also a bike shop down there, I would recommend for getting your bikes tuned, or w/e...it is called Elk City Cycles, and hte owner seems to be a real stand up guy.

My favorite thrift store: YWCA Past & Present Gently Used Clothing Store on Elizabeth Street on the East End

Second favorite: Mountain Mission on the West Side

Favorite ""hole in the wall"" or ""local"" restaurants and more specialty foods

Mi Cucina de Amor on Bigley Avenue on the West Side

Swiftwater Cafe on Washington Street (they serve breakfast too!)

Sarah's Bakery off of Bridge Road in South Hills. TRY THE ECLAIRS THEY ARE AMAZING

Starling's on Washington Street East

The Bear's Den on Capital Street, right around the corner from Swiftwater Cafe

Graziano's pizza on Capital Street if you like NY style pie, also has wonderful rolls, Sicilian salad and more. The Graziano's at the Riverwalk Plaza in South Charleston also has good pizza and hopefully soon will be doing their buffet lunches again. GREAT BUFFET, especially if you like all of their different specialty salads.

""upscale"" Chinese: Chin's on MacCorkle Avenue in Kanawha City

""regular"" Chinese: Main Kwong on Washington Street for takeout Chinese and China Buffet in Kanawha City for buffet style eating

Tidewater Grill: It's been a while since I've eaten there but they have AMAZING fresh baked bread and am amazing Greek salad bowl you can add salmon or chicken to that is a real meal

First Watch: Technically a chain but they pride themselves on being locally oriented. When it started, there were only two locations, one here and one in Florida. The owner wanted to put one in Charleston because they liked the town so much. Downtown on Summers Street.

Chow Thai on Shrewsbury Street (Thai)

Elephant Thai in South Charleston (Thai)

Pho Vinh Long in South Charleston (Vietnamese)

Ellen's Ice Cream downtown

Barbecue: Dem 2 Brothers and a Grill on the West Side

Favorite grocery stores: Aldi at Southridge, Ashton Place Kroger

Best international grocery: Pacific International Market in Kanawha City

Antique store: Stray Dog Antiques on Hale Street

Book store: Taylor Books downtown

Movie theater: Everyone likes Marquee it seems, but if you want less of a crowd and refillable popcorn and drinks, try Park Place Cinemas on Washington Street. Free parking in the garage after 5 p.m., fairly new remodel. When you buy tickets online, check which exact room it's in. Theater 1 has the biggest screen and used to have the best sound system in the entire state. The ticket prices are also cheaper than Marquee.

"Definitely check out Coonskin Park. And don't just park at the first parking lot and look around, keep driving into the park. It's actually pretty big.

For grocery stores, it's not the best city and you're gonna be on the wrong side of town, but there is a Piggly Wiggly as you come into Charleston through Bigley (yes, it's the Bigley Piggly Wiggly). The grocery store everyone likes the best is the Kroger on US119/Corridor G, a few miles south of downtown, Ashton Place Kroger. Also, depending on which direction your ""north"" is, you might be closer to the Kroger on I-79, Crossings Mall Kroger. I've never been there or heard anything about it, but might be worth checking out.

For outdoor gear, there is a Cabela's, but it's a little bit of a drive. It's also on Corridor G, but even further than the Kroger, in the Southridge shopping center.

And a few recs on restaurants: Gonzoburger, Black Sheep Burrito, Pies and Pints. And if you're ever feeling like a fast food breakfast, skip the big boys and go to Tudor's.

"## WARNING

### This is not a legitimate reddit user!

This is a **scammer** trying to rip you off.  Do not buy from any links in comments or messages!

* *Scammer:* **KathrynMendoza00^^^New**
* *This Post:* [Charleston Gift...!](https://old.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/nq2736/charleston_gift/)

## SCAMS ARE EVERYWHERE ON REDDIT

*Especially posts about...*

* **T-Shirts or Hoodies**
* **Coffee Cups or Mugs**
* **Printed masks**
* **Art prints or posters**
* **Stickers**

The post from a scammer or from a real user but have scam links in the comments. Drop-shipping scams use stolen art and third party sites to steal your money!  They will create new posts (such as this) and add scam links in the comments of actual redditors' posts.

Be careful, be safe! Don't buy from any websites you aren't familiar with and be very wary of any links you are sent, especially over chat or PM.

---

## BEWARE REDBUBBLE & AMAZON LINKS
Drop-ship spam rings have started using redbubble and amazon to front their scams. While you will get a shirt when placing orders, the print quality will likely be poor as the art is stolen - and you are supporting the scammer, not the artist.

---
## FAQ

1. *I don't see any links!* Often spammers will submit the post, and upvote it with alt accounts, and wait for it to get traction before posting the link.  Or, they won't post a link directly in comments but will PM or chat message anyone who comments with a link. **If you think this is a false-positive, please comment and a human will review.**

1. *How do you know they're a scammer?* Typical red flags are newer accounts with few or simple comments, but some scammers build or buy faux-accounts to avoid detection. The best thing you can do is avoid clicking on any links that don't go to a site you're familiar with, **especially** if the link seems to come from nowhere or is from a new / low karma account.

1. *How do you know in this specific case?* Unfortunately publishing all red flags would make it easier for the scammers to hide.  If you have a question, reply to this comment and the bot's operator will respond when they are able.

1. *But someone else posted the link, not OP* Scammers will use multiple accounts to look more innocent. They also use multiple accounts to upvote posts and comments to look more supported / show higher in browsing listings.

1. *I see links to Twitter, Imgur, Google, Linkedin, and other sites. are those safe?* The link itself, yes. HOWEVER those links will most likely then redirect you to ANOTHER link that has the shirt for ""sale"". Scammers use this tactic to avoid Reddit blacklisting their scammy domain names.

The thing is the biggest cities in wv are smaller than Texas college towns. That means some of your reflexes about human geography will be a little skewed here. There aren't really sprawly American suburbs except a little bit in Putnam county. Most sprawly bedroom community type places have a very, very rural character even ten minutes outside the town. At the same time, Charleston has a very rust belt character. There are events but there aren't many. Check out concerts and shows coming through and see if that's interesting

No private backyard, but there’s a large courtyard enclosed by the complex. Plus landlords are amazing, been here over 2 years and no plans to leave. Rent is decent. Built in the 30s. My husband and I love it here!

Edit: oh, & I would avoid Charleston’s West Side, East End, & downtown neighborhoods.

Honestly, half the landlords don't answer the phone/reply to e-mails. An unusually high number of landlords here don't allow pets. I called some places based on ""for rent"" signs in the yard, but some weren't actually available and most didn't allow pets.

"I have lived in Charleston my entire life (I'm 49) and it's better in some ways and worse in others. Drugs have gotten VERY bad here, the worst it's ever been. Prostitution is less visible (Summers Street used to be redlight central), but drug-related gun violence is up. I would say the biggest change has been the absolute crumbling of the West Side. When I was a little kid, it was a decent, working class style area with nice yards, etc. But slowly over time as people died and their kids had left the state, the slumlords bought the houses and things got really bad. People have  bought some of the homes from the old slumlords and revamped them to some extent, but there are still so many absolute crumbling eyesores there and that isn't going to change anytime soon. I think if you live across the river from downtown, things have gotten much better. Good homes, LOTS of shopping on Corridor G, good schools. Thousands of people have moved to the Corridor G area in the last 30 years. It's completely different now and although the traffic can be awful, there is a lot more to do and a lot more amenities out there.",t2_7ikvmkk0,RachelWWV,0,1618025264.0,0,t1_gu0aie5,gu0aie5,True,treistab,t3_ma7h2z,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/ma7h2z/for_those_whove_lived_here_for_a_while_does/,"For those who've lived here for a while, does Charleston seem to be getting better or worse?

"I helped a friend look for rental homes last year and the houses in Charleston have sky-high rent if they are decent at all. There are very few condos in the Valley unfortunately. Kenna Apartments might suit you if you are willing to accept an apartment at all. Another choice could be Edgewater Apartments; they have some two-bed, two-bath units in that building. I have also lived in Regal further down the Boulevard and the apartment I lived in was really nice but only one bedroom. I don't know what floorplans they have available. Living right on the Boulevard can be a great choice for ease of access to everything, but try to get a unit away from the street if you can.

"I grew up very close to Bridge Road and a ton of the houses have foundation and structural problems because of the hillsides. Also, the road itself has become much busier than it used to be and can be VERY noisy if you live on it or very close to it. Finally, the city is usually pretty good about scraping the road in the mornings, but if you work at night you are going to have a VERY hard time getting home in the wee hours. I had to park on Grosscup Road and walk up the hill once, and another time I had to stay the night with my dad downtown because the road was so bad I had to back down Bridge because I couldn't get past the first big curve at the bottom. So just know if you have an ""off"" schedule you WILL eventually have issues in the wintertime. 

Also, and I am saying this as a person who grew up in that immediate area, the rich people in South Hills are horrible, entitled drivers who tend to drive in the middle of the road. I have had near head-on collisions on Bridge Road at least four times because people were flying down the hill in the center of the road. A couple of them were VERY close calls and one was so close I had a panic attack.

The area overall is nice, but you will end up having some hair-raising experiences on Bridge Road if you live there long enough. I lived in the immediate area for almost 30 years, and nothing has changed up there. It's still the same old crap from the drivers every time I go up there LOL",t2_7ikvmkk0,RachelWWV,0,1618023375.0,0,t1_gu07cln,gu07cln,True,Three0hFour,t3_mng7vu,https://www.reddit.com/r/charlestonwv/comments/mng7vu/living_off_bridge_road/,Living off Bridge Road?,/r/charlestonwv/comments/mng7vu/living_off_bridge_road/gu07cln/,2,r/charlestonwv,0,2
"Actually have experience as currently live in the area. Lol. Our house we're renting has a bunch of issues and the neighbor behind us informed us that yeap, surrounding houses all have the same problem, even with good upkeep.
Noise is pretty bad on the top 2 floors while you can't really hear anything outside, in the ""basement"". But it's because old windows and the ""old time charm"". Hopefully the house you're looking at has been updated and well maintained or you're prepared to shell out a pretty penny. 

Our driveway is beyond horrendous to get in and out of, we're waiting for an accident, most people wouldn't know it's there. We slid off our driveway a few times this winter and the hill itself can be slick. Our yard, neighbors and the street are kinda just crumbling. It's kind of a bit of wear and tear on your vehicle, riding brakes going down, using more gas going up. 

The fire department, I've noticed really tries to not use sirens until further to downtown, their engines are the loudest. Can occasionally get busy with traffic but never anything too bad, the turn from myrtle causes the most backups lol. 

The walk up to the shops is decent and quick, the surrounding area is beautiful. During the weekend you can hear the people up at the shops laughing and enjoying themselves. It's a great mix of nature and cityish life if you just want to walk to grab a pizza and drink.

I think the opposite. Touristy small towns are better than ever and Morgantown is great.

Wanted to jump in and say it's a nice drive. Falling Spring Falls near covington is a few miles off the freeway but a really remarkable waterfall that is easily accessed. Lewisburg has a shockingly nice collection of restaurants. Lewisburg is tiny but it has a better restaurant scene than Charleston. Stardust Cafe is nice. Tamarack near beckley is the best interstate rest stop of all rest stops. Also, if you've never seen it, the NRG bridge is only 25 miles off the turnpike.

"Capitol street is nice for a quick stroll to check out some shops and restaurants.  Like a very mini version of Carytown.

A walk down the Kanawha River is always nice this time of year. Unfortunately there's nothing like Belle Isle or the canal walk.

The state museum is pretty cool. Like VMFA, it's free. Mostly talks about the history of West Virginia, but has some exhibits on geology and art too.

I think the capitol building is open, but they might only have certain areas open (due to COVID). It's free to check out and surprisingly you don't have to go through a metal detector.

Oh, and do you remember when the Powhite didn't have express E-ZPass lanes? Yeah, that's how the WV Turnpike still is, so be prepared to slow down for tolls.
