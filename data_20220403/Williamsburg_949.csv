"Did you realize the Natural Bridge is about a 3 hour drive away? If you're up for the drive it's a wonderful place to visit. 

We started taking our son to Williamsburg when he was 5, we felt there was plenty to do. We would do all the colonial sights and venture to the Living Museum, which you mentioned. We really liked it. There is a Zoo in the Norfolk Area. We like to drive to Yorktown, they have a nice riverfront and sandy beach.

"Williamsburg Winery has one of the best resteraunts in town.  You like wine so its a win-win.  Great place for Lunch.  Williamsburg is a neat alcohol town.  There is a meadery thats very popular (think sweet wine made from honey).  Joker's Brewing was also serving alcoholic kambucha if you are feeling crazy.  There are several breweries in town, the best for kids is probably precarious.  It has an arcade in it.  Its also downtown so you are near colonial.  Virinia Beer Company has one of the best IPA's in town (Free Verse).  There's also a distillery if you are into whiskey.  I havnt been honestly, but its a place I want to check out.  As for a fancy place to eat, the whaling company is actually pretty good.  Everytime I've been to  Amber Ox, the food was cold.  It has a neat vibe though.  That place is packed, it might be hard to get in.  I prefer the hounds tale, which has a neat little sitting area detached from the main building with a reduced menu.  We have alot of fun there.  Food for thought is a great place to bring kids.  They are awesome with food alergies btw.  I like pierce's pitt barbq, but i know alot of people that dont like the sweet tomato base.  As for kids, try Jamestown, and Yorktown museum.  its some fun history stuff.  Busch Gardens is a big draw around here, but expect crowds unless you go on a weekday.  Do you like escape rooms?  We have a blast everytime we go.  There are 2 places here, but you need a reservation.  Theres also some lowerkey places like the bowling alley, bounce house (really fun for kids, but adults just sit on their phones mainly), movie theatres.  ""Go Kart Plus"" has some fun stuff outside but the arcade is awesome.  We go just for the arcade.  There is also a really fun putt putt course called ""Pirates cove"".  Thats about all I can think of.",t2_x0r92,bittenbyredmosquito,0,1648853083.0,0,t1_i31jnvd,i31jnvd,True,ThisGuyHurr,t3_tu0s88,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/tu0s88/visiting_williamsburg_in_april_suggestion/,Visiting Williamsburg in April - Suggestion Searching…,/r/williamsburgva/comments/tu0s88/visiting_williamsburg_in_april_suggestion/i31jnvd/,1,r/williamsburgva,0,1
"For *Nice* restaurants, check out Le Yaca. Amazing french bistro.

Oysters: Barrett's.

Kid friendly activities: I'd go with York River State Park over Waller Mill. Natural Bridge is great. The interpreter run activities at Jamestown Settlement are a lot of fun and educational.

Wineries: Williamsburg Winery, Saude Creek, New Kent.

"For the Fat Canary, yes, it's often booked upstairs in the main restaurant. However, there is a downstairs Fat Canary which is often less booked. It's a nice bar with tables too but you order off the upstairs menu. There is also the Blue Talon which is a very nice restaurant with a great menu and nice atmosphere. Lastly, the Amber Ox is really a great place with great food. 

Casa Pearl will have Oysters as it's mainly a seafood restaurant. 

The Chickahominy House is breakfast and lunch. It's old fashioned but very good. There is also the Carrot Tree which is also good for lunch and probably breakfast too. 

Williamsburg has its own winery so you don't have to drive far. I don't drink wine but my wife and friends seem to enjoy it. 

For kids, Colonial Williamsburg is pretty enjoyable because there are so many things to see and explore. The same with Jamestown and, to a lesser degree, Yorktown. Obviously Busch Gardens - for a theme park. There's a Ripley's Museum that I believe is still open. Also, for a fun restaurant for kids is Charley's  Airport Restaurant to watch planes landing and taking off over burgers/sandwiches.",t2_46sv2r6o,Expat111,0,1648847638.0,0,t1_i317qa6,i317qa6,True,ThisGuyHurr,t3_tu0s88,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/tu0s88/visiting_williamsburg_in_april_suggestion/,Visiting Williamsburg in April - Suggestion Searching…,/r/williamsburgva/comments/tu0s88/visiting_williamsburg_in_april_suggestion/i317qa6/,1,r/williamsburgva,0,1
"My 2 cents, two drummers blows pierces out of the water 

Oysters- Barrett’s seafood in colonial Williamsburg 
Casa pearl on Merrimack trail

Activities, there isn’t much to do for really young kids here. Depending on their age maybe look into Go Ape? If you end up going to natural bridge there’s a drive through safari park that’s pretty neat 

Williamsburg winery is really nice. I can’t attest to quality because I don’t drink wine at all. But I’ve heard decent things about it. Good restaurant there as well.

"Favorite for 'atmosphere' for me is the Seafare on Richmond Road.

Built in 1968 and still has the original blue Naugahyde booths, old backlit pics of ocean liners on the walls with lighted portholes, waiters running around in tuxedoes.  It feels like Frank Sinatra is coming onstage to do his second set after your meal is done.

It's a little pricey but the food is good, still run by the original Greek family - I heartily support locally owned businesses and this one has been around for a long time.

Could you find someplace trendier, someplace that's a better bargain?  Of course.  So what?

"Williamsburg has a veneer of wealthy retirees but an interesting underbelly of other populations.  There is a mental hospital and a substance-abuse rehab here, as well as the College.  That means that there exists among the bland suburban subdivisions several group/shared homes of varying purpose.  Furthermore, Colonial Williamsburg and the two amusement parks Busch Gardens and Water Country have had a recent history of importing seasonal workers from foreign countries, many of whom found ways to stay and become part of the mix of ethnicities.  The outskirts of town contain trailer parks, rural enclaves, and we even have a few transient residential hotels disguised as common tourist traps.  While there are no prominent LGBTQ+ organizations that I know of, there is definitely a tolerant air about the town, since the historic area attracts artists, theatrical performers, antique collectors, musicians, animal lovers, and other eccentric interests.  But yeah, if you just drive down the street you'll see a lot of BMW-driving housewives, and old white guys in golf slacks, eating at overpriced restaurants.",t2_3zcn3,pizzaforce3,0,1646456462.0,0,t1_hzezna8,hzezna8,True,GabrahamLincoln1,t3_t6xued,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/t6xued/is_williamsburg_diverse/,Is Williamsburg diverse?,/r/williamsburgva/comments/t6xued/is_williamsburg_diverse/hzezna8/,8,r/williamsburgva,0,8

"I got the gym at least 4 times a week now and usually watch what I eat, at least as far as net calories. 

It’s made noticeable difference in what I can do with my daughters and how I feel every day. 

If I had to recommend anything to start with, look at StrongLifts. It’s all barbell work, but it’s a full body workout. The added strength is great, and the form you learn helps you avoid other injuries because you learn how good use of your strength feels. 

I use that as my core of my workouts right now, three days a week. The other days are some form of cardio based workout, like a tabata, running (treadmill in winter, outdoors when the weather is good), work with the heavy bag (you’d be surprised how exhausting punching a bag can be; it’s a full bodied, high energy workout), or whatever I can think of.

Btw, 40 is the time to get your health in order. Workout, build some extra muscle, drop any excess weight, change your diet. You can still have a ton of fun for years but you need to prep your body to go another 40 or more years. It makes a big difference.

"Hey! You started that thread over on r/BargainBinVinyl/earlier, heh.

It seems like all the other Goodwills have also lost their minds, as well. I think the first place I actually saw the price increase to $4 was either at the one on Jefferson in Newport News or the Saville Row location down in Hampton. And it's always dreck like 101 Strings, ""Mr. Acker Bilk's Greatest Hits"" and 5 or 6 different copies of ""The First Family featuring Vaughn Meader"".

I'm not even sure what CHKD stores are charging these days. Half the stuff they have is usually empty sleeves from Herb Alpert records, anyway.

Thrift Store City down in Norfolk now wants $4.98 for LPs, unless they think it might be something actually worth buying in which case they mark it up further. Thrift Store USA also down in that neck of the woods seemed more reasonable, mostly $2 LPs in decent condition, but the selection was heavily skewed towards lesser known 60's and 70's country and pop vocalists, and a bunch of Al Hirt and Pete Fountain records last time I was there, none of which particularly interests me.

The Bargain Box down in Yorktown occasionally lets something slip through... I managed to pick up a stereo copy of Dave Brubeck's ""Time Out"" in decent condition for I think a buck last time I made it down there, but I had to dig through a bunch of Myron Floren and Zamfir records to find it.

"The goodwill situation is insane. The first time I went in there after they raised prices, I told the lady at the checkout (politely) that $4 for thrift store records was absurd. 

I went in on friday to check to see if they had dropped prices yet. Not only did they have the same Tom T. Hall records that I left on the counter in December, but they had an entire new section of shelving with probably 400-500 records that have accumulated on top of their already overflowing record shelves. 

I'd be surprised if they've sold more than half a dozen records since they raise prices to $4.

"Nothing in Williamsburg as such that I'm aware of. I haven't been out there in ages but I recall some of the vendors at the Williamsburg Antique Mall had some vinyl a while back, one booth in particular had a fair bit of classic rock and R&B stuff. The thrift stores (Goodwill, CHKD, DAV) generally have total crap, and Goodwill in particular has gone insane now charging $4 a pop for moldy Lawrence Welk records. DAV was charging $2 each last time I was in there, though it was mostly a bunch of low-budget 1970's gospel LPs and recently they got in a load of early 2000's UK techno 12"" singles mostly from people I've never heard of.

I haven't been in the ReStore here recently, it seemed like someone who was heavily into classical music died and had their collection donated last time I was there. Previously it was a lot of mildewed Mantovani LPs and broken 78s. I think they also had jacked up their prices.

I know that 2nd & Charles on Jefferson Ave down in Newport News had a fair bit of both new and used vinyl when I went in there a while back. Prices were all over the place though, they seemed to think some of their generic pressings of 1980's stuff were worth double or triple the median price on [Discogs.com](https://Discogs.com), other prices were fair to so-so.

I know there are some places further out like up in Richmond and down in Virginia Beach that are supposed to be actual proper music stores, but I haven't investigated those myself yet.",t2_5a33jcya,AdmiralMungBeanSoda,0,1644143341.0,0,t1_hvspkni,hvspkni,True,venomous_x,t3_slq73r,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/slq73r/any_local_vinyl_stores_in_the_area/,Any local vinyl stores in the area ?,/r/williamsburgva/comments/slq73r/any_local_vinyl_stores_in_the_area/hvspkni/,3,r/williamsburgva,0,3

"Our House was built in '76, and while the HVAC is 'newer' (\~10yrs old now, replaced a terrible oil heater) and always sucks during these really frigid days.  And like yours, it's just the heat pump with Aux coils.  Those coils are horrible for the power bill too.  


What do you guys have for insulation?    


When we got the house, it seemed nice enough, but we didn't know how bad the thermal efficiency was.  


We had some crappy blown-in insulation in the attic, covered with attic board and the original 1976 oil heater (running at about 60% efficiency and cost nearly $2500 in oil for the first winter)  


Nothing in the crawl space and the exterior walls seem to be hit-and-miss.  ie.  The family room had wood paneling over the studs, and the brick exterior, but nothing in between.  Dining room shares a wall with the garage, un-insulated, but the garage exterior seems partially insulated....?  


Eventually we rolled out some R34 on top of the board in the attic.  We also tacked up the radiant barrier in the attic as well.    


Under the house, I started putting some stuff in (R19, I think?  Maybe thicker).  Only about 1/4th of the way done though because I'm lazy.  :(  Any time we've had to open a wall, we've put in insulation as well.

"Ah yes, it wouldn't be a post about Williamsburg without mentioning Confusion Corner.  
It seems, aside from the previously-discussed YOUSUCK intersection, this is possibly the most confusing bit of road in our dear little village. Here's your handy-dandy hierarchy for who goes when:  
1) Light Green can ALWAYS go. Because Point C is one-way AWAY from the intersection, there's no need to yield on left-hand turns.  
2) Dark Green can ALWAYS go. This traffic should never stop or yield.  
3) Red goes next, and generally never has to yield or stop.  
4) Blue yields to Light Green.  
5) Light Purple can always go.  
6) Dark Purple yields to Dark Green, but otherwise proceeds straight through.  
7) White STOPS for Dark Green, then proceeds straight through. (Note #1, Light Green can always go.)  
8) Orange STOPS for Dark Green, Dark Purple, AND Light Purple. Basically, if you're Orange, STOP FOR EVERYONE!!!

"Since it gets asked a lot, I figured I'd write a short defense of the Yellow Obviously Ugly Semi-reflective Unavoidable Concrete doohicKey, or YOUSUCK. 

  
For starters, I live across the street from this, so my perspective comes from the past five years of observing this intersection daily.

  
I've attached a brief graphic that provides the best defense of YOUSUCK. There are two lanes (from Point A) making the left-hand turn from John Tyler Highway onto Kings Way. The outside lane (shown with the orange arrow) proceeds straight towards Point D, while the inside lane (shown in green) turns left towards Point B.  Now, YOUSUCK was installed to ONLY allow for a right-hand turn from Point B. This prevents going straight towards Point C. 

  
Let's imagine what would happen if YOUSUCK didn't exist. If traffic was allowed to flow from Point B directly to Point C (shown with the white arrow), the vehicles in the green arrow hides the potential orange vehicles. This would create a point of collision between the white arrow and the orange arrow, as shown with the friendly boom.

  
In short, it's yellow. It's big. It has reflectors. It has countless tire marks. It will almost definitely save countless vehicles and maybe a life or two. If you get in an accident now, instead of crashing into an orange vehicle that's doing nothing wrong, you'll crash your own vehicle into YOUSUCK, limiting the damage.

  
If you do hit YOUSUCK, I'd recommend the following steps:  
 \- Turn around and turn in your drivers license at the DMV  
 \- Schedule an eye exam in the shopping center a few feet from your accident  
 \- DON'T post about how dumb YOUSUCK is on Facebook or Nextdoor.",t2_34h677wm,millerj1993,0,1643307498.0,0,t1_hugy2sm,hugy2sm,True,millerj1993,t3_se4u0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/se4u0n/in_defense_of_the_yellow_obviously_ugly/,"In defense of the Yellow Obviously Ugly Semi-reflective Unavoidable Concrete doohicKey, or YOUSUCK",/r/williamsburgva/comments/se4u0n/in_defense_of_the_yellow_obviously_ugly/hugy2sm/,11,r/williamsburgva,0,11

1. Even if it's legal to grow weed, you need to break the law in some form or another to obtain weed to grow.

2. Even if it's legal to then smoke that weed, doing anything else with it, like making edibles, is still against the law.

"It definitely depends on the type of doctor. For example, I see a speciality doctor regularly, but he is only up in Williamsburg from Newport News (about 35 minutes away) on Tuesdays. I have to make my appts every 3 months and I make them at the end of each appt seeing him. I really cannot change or cancel, or else I have to go to his other office. Even then, finding him, I was lucky and got an appt right away due to a cancellation. While he was technically accepting new patients, I couldn't get an appt for months. I know a lot of people go to Richmond (about 45-50 minutes away) or Norfolk (about 45-60 minutes away) for specialty doctors.

"Thanks for the food ideas! Nate and I were just fixing up figure out where to go. We slept in this morning after the hellish that was yesterday. Got up at 4 and didn't get here until 8ish. Thankfully, our planes were all on time but after getting to Raleigh and figuring out transportation I figured out my freaking license expired a week and a half ago so no one would rent to me and one company would my 18 yo son for $50 extra a day. I ended up renting from a nice guy on Turo and he agreed to let Nate drive. After spending $25 bucks on a Lyft to pick it up and an hour with him driving I thought there was no way we would make it here. His driving on areas he wasn't familiar with stressed me out and he was getting too tired to drive so we stopped to eat and move around. While eating my friend text to make sure we arrived ok and I told her everything and she informed me I could renew my license ONLINE.  It could have all been avoided!!! That being said, I'm thankful we made it safely, I can drive the whole trip and that we were able to find a car at all. It was worth the $400 we spent on a 2012 Camry to be able to not be stranded in Raleigh lol. 

Oh, forgot to mention we do have Publix at home and I agree that their deli is great. Their house garlic pickles are THE BEST part of their subs imo. I'm a finicky person so I just get meat, cheese, and a very light layer of mayo then get it toasted. Yum!

We do plan to go to Virginia Beach tomorrow. There's an international car show Nate found he wants to go to and I just want to put my feet in sand, cold or not lol. At least it'll be the warmest day there during our trip.

I feel ya on the tornadoes. I've only seen one in my life and it was in my rear view mirror and I was 16 so that was pretty unnerving. I was working at a grocery store and we knew it was bad then a sheriff's officer pulled up yelling at us to leave which I thought was odd since we could've gotten in the cooler but we did what he told us. Thank goodness I only lived 4 minutes away but we were living in a trailer at the time while our house was being built and as I pulled up my dad was yelling at me to get in the truck to go to a friend's storm shelter close to us. As we got in the shelter we nearly couldn't get the door to shut due to the winds but as we got it closed something passed over us. Oh, and my grocery store was hit so I canceled my trip to Mississippi to help clean it up. It wasn't a total loss or anything but there was bad damage. At least 6"" of snow didn't drop on it the next day. I'm sure my brother was thankful for tarps after his roof damage!",t2_13rkgj,kgoble78,0,1641658749.0,0,t1_hrsi6h0,hrsi6h0,False,kgoble78,t3_r7rf4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/r7rf4r/is_it_worth_visiting_williamsburg_in_midjanuary/,Is it worth visiting Williamsburg in mid-January?,/r/williamsburgva/comments/r7rf4r/is_it_worth_visiting_williamsburg_in_midjanuary/hrsi6h0/,1,r/williamsburgva,0,1

"Wow! Great info! I looked at the calendar and we'll have 5 full days there before we have to drive back to Raleigh. Maybe on our first full day there we can walk the area and see the stretch of DOG and get a feel for where everything is and go from there. 

I don't mind spending the money for the tickets I just don't want to buy a multi-day ticket if we can do something in a day, kwim? I think he and I should sit down and decide what's most important to see but the hard part is there's so many things that go with different locations like museums and such that the planning can become confusing. Maybe I need to put everything on paper instead of going back and forth on their websites. 

That 7-11 sounds cool and so does the drive with funny signs. We can get into that kind of thing because we're dorks lol. I'm already hyped about how many pokestops there will be 🤣.

I guess the good thing about going this time of year is that there will be less of a crowd and less traffic. Saw a lot was closed today due to weather and was glad it didn't overlap with our trip. What's the weather like now?

 We had a tornado in our small town Saturday night (it was 80 degrees here that day) then the winter storm came through the next night and dropped 6.5"" of snow on us! Talk about weather whiplash! Went from 80 to 20ish degrees in a 24hr time frame. There was even thunder snow near me! 

We were very excited about the snow since we only get flurries some years, maybe a dusting, but 6.5"" is rare, like every 10 years rare, it just happened to coincide with a tornado which was a bummer.

"Seller Disclosures are a requirement in California but Seller Disclosures are not a requirement in Virginia which is sadly needed in VA but it remains a caveat emptor (buyer beware) state and also seller beware state.  I have discovered so many things about different homes in VA.  

In one case, I found an issue with the sewer system and septic tank that passed through 2 prior sales which means it got through 4 different REALTORS® both on the Buyers side and the Sellers side because they did no research.  I saved my Buyer a ton of headache and heartache on this property before my Buyer purchased it.  The house was not attached to the sewer system and the Seller had been paying sewer bills since she moved in.  The Seller had no idea that their was grandfathered permission about not having to tap into the sewer but being charged a sewer bill anyway.  (I can  provide a deeper explanation on the phone.). 

Once the material fact was discovered, the Seller had to do the repairs since it was brought to their attention because even if they did not sell it, they had to fix it in order to rent it out.  All it took was a few phone calls to the county and the health department to find the issue but it was obvious that the four (4) prior agents did nothing to find this information out.  My Buyer still wanted the house but paid nothing for this costly fix.  They only spent just a little extra time to close until it was fixed.  The Seller paid double digit thousands of dollars to pay to fix the issues.  (Note:  Just because a Seller is paying a sewer bill does not mean that the home is tapped into the sewer system.

"If you're on that side of town and it's not raining, I'd recommend heading back to Busch Gardens at around 8:30 if you like Roller Coasters. The park really starts to clear out once most of the shows are over - my family was there on Tuesday night and we were able to basically walk right on Apollos Chariot just before 9:30, instead of the \~1hr wait it had earlier in the day. Then we hoofed it over to New France to walk right on Invadr and then caught the last Christmastown Express train ride of the night after that. (Note that it was actually a little after 10 when that train left, so they might not normally run it that late, ymmv). The decorations are much prettier at night and it's a better experience when the park is less crowded.

Edit: Also, if you're near the Fest Haus at one of the half hour marks (8:00, 8:30, 9\_00, etc) be sure to watch the light show on the tree outside the Fest Haus.

"I'd suggest checking out Bassett Hall if you're going to be in Colonial Williamsburg. It's where John D. Rockefeller and his wife lived during the restoration of Colonial Williamsburg. 

Bruton Parish is the church you'll see when you're in Colonial Williamsburg, and it's worth going in if it is open to the public when you're there. It's still used for services. 

The Governor's Palace is a place you'll see when you do the ghost tour. You can tour the inside separately from the ghost tour, and it's pretty interesting. The hedge maze and gardens in the back are neat. You'll also see the Randolph House, and you can tour the inside of it separately from the ghost tour as well. 

If you want a good breakfast, you can't really go wrong with the Chickahominy House. It's open from 8:30 am to 2:30 pm. 

If you make the dive to Yorktown via the Colonial Parkway and are looking for a place to get lunch, I'd suggest Yorktown Pub. They usually have pretty good sea food there, although it has been a while since I've been there myself. 

There's also some nice shops along the waterfront if you're in Yorktown. 

If antiquing is something you like to do, then there's the Lightfoot Antique Mall. It's a pretty big place to browse. 

There's a lot more things I could name that I'm missing, but I'm sure that someone will mention the places I have forgotten.

"Lived all over and like Williamsburg VA the best, but I suppose it depends on what you like.  If you are in your 20's and want to go bar hopping every weekend, its probably not the place for you.  If you have a family and want stuff to do with your kids every weekend, Williamsburg is great for that.  Small town feel with medium size town ammenidies.  

Highlights: 

Great shopping  - box stores, outlets, specialty stuff too, car dealerships).

Lots of resaurants - Chains if you like that and some unique things.

Pretty neat brewery scene - Billsburg, Ale works, Bass Cannon, Va Beer Company

Touristy desstinations - Busch Gardens, Jamestown, Colonial Williamsburg, Williamsburg Winery, College of William and Mary (sports and shows and things)

Outdoorsy stuff - Lots of golf and country clubs.  Lots of parks w/ playgrounds.  Several river beaches .  Incredible bike trails.

&#x200B;

Drawbacks - Housing prices are getting pretty dern high right now.  Crowds can be an isssue in the touristy places.  They add extra tax at resteraunts, so your bill is higher than it would be outside of williamsburg.",t2_x0r92,bittenbyredmosquito,0,1640284193.0,0,t1_hppmpu8,hppmpu8,True,ContentVeteran,t3_rmhb7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/rmhb7i/so_i_posted_on_the_virginia_reddit_about_moving/,So I posted on the Virginia reddit about moving from Iowa to Virginia a few days ago and my wife and I fell in love with Williamsburg.

"Hello! I’m also in my mid-20s, but I’ve lived here my whole life. 

1.	Summers aren’t terrible. There will be days that you don’t go outside. There will also be days where it’s beautiful. Jamestown Beach is an excellent place to spend some free time during the summer. 
2.	Junior Women’s League is popular. If you’re into sports, check out Club Waka. I made a lot of friends through my side hustle- working at a brewery. 
3.	Lots of stuff happens on the lawn of the art museum. We’re located nicely between Richmond (Altria Theater) and Norfolk (Chrysler Hall). 
4.	Not much snow here. It just gets cold. We might get 3-6 inches a year. Everything will shut down for a dusting. Virginia just doesn’t have the infrastructure to prepare to possibly have snow. 
5.	Williamsburg is expensive. Check out Newport News and Yorktown. We had a nice apartment at Clairmont in Yorktown for 2 years.

"1. It can get to be like a sauna sometimes.

2. Junior Women's Club and Aspire are some organizations worth looking into.

3. There is, but there is WAY more in Richmond.

4. Very minimal, but keep in mind that small amounts of snow will shut things down. When it does snow here, It's usually preceeded by rain that washes away the pretreat and forms a nice ice rink on the roads as it melts the next day.

5. Check along Longhill Rd (Seasons Trace, Spotswood, etc) and around Merrimac Trail.

6. There are a lot of very good locally owned options here.

"Welcome to Williamsburg! I'm sure we'll be glad you're here!

I'm a recent transplant myself after moving from the Midwest. There's a street fest every second Sunday of the month. If you want to hit up one after you move, let me know. :) 

Did you get a job from CWF? You might have some luck looking for housing through their real estate department. I tried to find housing during the summer, when prices are at their highest. Don't recommend. You're definitely moving at the right time.

Re: Food. Berrets is a little pricey but has good sea food. Def the kind of place you dress up for. Personally, I'm a sucker for the crab cake sandwich at Retro Good Eats, which also has great burgers. A lot of folks love Aromas. 

If you're looking for a ""fun"" experience, I definitely recommend The Copper Fox. They are a whiskey distillery with a speak easy bar.

"Cliffs Notes

1) Pretty Hot and Humid in the summer though last summer wasn’t that bad come to think of it.

2) Probably the most difficult we are really a retirement and family community that has a College. Most of those kids stick to themselves. The town really shuts down after 9. But maybe a 25 yo will answer you.

3) Yes actually from 2nd Sundays, The Kimball Theater, Williamsburg Players, Colonial Reinterpretors.

4) Non existent. Hasn’t really really (like enough to effect your life) snowed here in 2 years.

5) Oh yeah that’s going to be EXTREMELY hard

6) Food For Thought, Craft 31, Precarious Beer etc",t2_6q4pcloh,thefrostryan,0,1639480685.0,0,t1_hohyqrg,hohyqrg,True,wyominghistoryqueen,t3_rg168h,https://www.reddit.com/r/williamsburgva/comments/rg168h/moving_to_williamsburghave_several_questions/,Moving to Williamsburg...Have Several Questions,/r/williamsburgva/comments/rg168h/moving_to_williamsburghave_several_questions/hohyqrg/,2,r/williamsburgva,0,2

"There aren't any board game cafés that I know of, but fortunately Williamsburg has a plethora of very nice breweries that are always welcoming to board gamers. I have personally brought games to Alewerks and it was fun. These places are also usually looking for a weeknight activities, so if you thought you could bring in enough people, I'm sure one of them would be interested in letting you host a game night.
