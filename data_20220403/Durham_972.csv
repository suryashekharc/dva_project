"Saw it yesterday. Wouldn't say I hated it per se, but it was an uncomfortable experience.

There's a song where a character tries to convince another to hang themself (apparently this was in the original but is somehow not as dark and is instead funny?). It was eerie to hear some stifled laughter from audience members who expected this to be a funny part of the musical, while I was horrified at the Blair Witch Project + suicide encouragement take on this song.

There's a very artsy (i.e. I didn't understand it) dream sequence with discordant, loud electric guitar. It goes on very long.

The ending of the musical is very dark with some social injustice issues thrown in, but that dark climax is sandwiched in between the conclusion of a campy, and fun storyline of side characters. Felt very off.

Overall, I thought it was interesting but not something I would see again. The worst issues imo are the audio issues. It was difficult to hear the lyrics of the songs over the instruments. There was an angry corn shucking song that I didn't hear a single word of. I still don't know why they were so angrily shucking that corn.",t2_iaevq,robby_w_g,0,1648935585.0,0,t1_i35kkx3,i35kkx3,False,durhamStuff,t3_tuofy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/tuofy9/dpac_show_oklahoma_tonight_8pm_if_you_hate_sports/,"DPAC show (Oklahoma) tonight 8PM.

Of course if it dries and then there's a pretty quick rain shower after that I would wait until the rain has completely dried.

"100% agree. Alcove is total crap and they have too many Brittanys working there. You never know which one you spoke with and they use that to say they don’t know what was promised by the other one before you moved in. 
They have “I got my money, now screw you, on to the next sucker looking for a cheap place to live “ attitude. And it wasn’t even that cheap, payed close to 1K for one bedroom in a 3 bed house. 

Oh and I was assured when signing the lease that I can sublet if I was moving out early (this was important to me since I was between jobs and needed to be ready to hit the road wherever my next one was). So when I found a job in a new state and asked to sublet with 2 months left, they replied “we have decided not to do that at this time, thanks for asking”.  Translation: shut up and pay the rest of the rent cos we don’t feel like doing the work and you have no other option.

Nope. The problem is companies or investors with superior buying power purchase houses for more than an individual or family can complete with. Then they charge rent that is higher than a mortgage.

They only had two bedroom though and we had to upsize so we are in a larger apartment not managed by GSC Apartments, it managed by Thailhimer and they are a big corporate conglomerate and I don’t really like them as much.

"Flower or edibles or what? Regardless of who is selling it, please research the brand and ask if the retailer has had an independent lab analyze the products. The Delta 8/9/10 market is unregulated, and some manufacturers take shortcuts.

I’ll edit this reply in a little bit and provide some recommendations.

Edit 1:

For Delta-8 edibles, Bhumi chocolates are sold in a lot of locations, such as the [Carolina Hemp Hut on 15/501](https://carolinahemphut.com/location/hemp-hut-durham/). My favorite gummies are made by Creating Better Days, but I haven't found them locally so I order online. Same for PERL gummies.

If you're looking for flower, be careful and do your due diligence. I only buy cold infused (like ""Friendly Hemp"" brand strains).

Edit 2: Forgot to mention that Bhumi is a female-owned, Asheville-based company. [https://www.bhumicbd.com/](https://www.bhumicbd.com/) Their chocolate bars are delicious, but please monitor your dosing. Start small with a single piece...not half the bar.

"I think it really depends on which direction your unit faces. Mine (in Liberty) faced the park (West) and I really only got noise from them (drummers and concerts), people occasionally peeling out, and then Foster at the Park’s pool area bounces off Liberty’s building quite loudly. 

My partner lived on the other side of the building (East) facing the studio-apartment complex (atlas?), and the construction would start every morning at 6:30am. 

South faces the skatepark and the other new condos going up, and north will be facing all the construction going on around Motorco and old pickleback.

"Depends on a lot. First I would check what type of water line you have, copper or pvc (just open your meter box and see what is running out on your side of it). That will also tell you about how deep the line is buried. If it is under the concrete driveway you will have to either bust or cut the concrete to get to the leak. Again, it helps to know exactly where the leak is. Then it’s as simple as either a pipe repair clamp or a small section of pipe which can be clamped at either end. You can even call a utility locator to come and locate your utilities for free (811, Call before you Dig)!    

Like I said though if the leak is under the driveway there is a chance the subsurface under your concrete is compromised meaning it could settle and lead to low spots or cracks in the concrete.

"Durham Parks & Rec does organize some soccer, but it's by team. As in, you and 10+ of your soccer-playing friends can sign up as a team and Parks & Rec organizes games. At least that was my understanding when I last tried to figure this out.

So instead, for general recreational soccer, I'd recommend looking into OCASL/DCASL, the Orange County Adult Soccer League/Durham County Adult Soccer League. It's the same org, but nominally split by county so they can rent fields in both counties.

The spring season has started, but I think you can still sign up for pickup only. Many of the fields are in Chapel Hill, but you likely will have to drive to a field no matter what. The level of play varies quite a bit but there's plenty of room for folks getting back into the game after some time off. Not a lot of instruction, though, so not great if you aren't already familiar with the rules. Don't forget to stretch! :)

"I'm a librarian, so I can speak to this. It definitely depends. I, as someone with no kids or dependents, early in my career, don't mind working nights and Saturdays for example. But I have co-workers who have kids, and they can't work late into the night every night, just like everyone else who enjoys 9-5 schedules and can get their kids (plus our salary really doesn't allow for paying for childcare). I wouldn't be a fan of Sundays though, because most libraries open on Sundays are only open for 4 hours, which means we would do two half days a week - which basically means we would only have 1 full day off. Which, after doing 6 years of college, I feel like I have earned 2 full days off a week lmfao.   


I think the issue isn't what librarians are willing to do, it's that we being expected to do more with less and less and be happy about it because we're serving the public and the greater good. We value public libraries more than anything, which is why we need more funding, and better staffing. Ignoring that and pushing forward anyways with being open later and more often, without breaks, just leads to burnout in the field, which is a major problem. Also, as much as we enjoy doing programs and having books for kids, a reminder to folks that our job isn't to keep your kids busy - that's your job! We aren't babysitters.   


Also, to people stating that librarians don't have to work weekends, PT staff can -  our PT staff is great! They do so much and don't get the recognition they deserve! But libraries are way more than checking in and out books and shelving. You want tech help on the weekends? You want programming? Reader's advisory and reference questions answered? You're gonna need a librarian.   


I get what you're saying though - I appreciate that you value public libraries so much!

"Wake County is open all seven days. Working the weekend kind of sucks, but you do reach different people by being open on the weekend. Librarian jobs are advertised as having to work one night and a weekend rotation, which works out to every third or fourth weekend. This way, there is always a Librarian around to serve as a manager on duty. In general, though, there are less librarians staffed on the nights or weekends and you’ll find the highest concentration of them during normal business hours. I doubt there would be any problems among Durham employees if they added back Sundays, provided that extra positions were funded to cover them. 

As the other user said, kids are actually mostly in the library during the day, not the night. Families come in the morning, then we get a dash of middle schoolers for an hour or so after they get out of school but by dinner time it’s pretty much all adults. 

Wake lost an hour on either end of the work day when COVID happened (going from 9-9 to 10-8) and the general impression is that getting the morning hour back is much more important than getting the night one back.",t2_94e7o,d4vezac,0,1648561434.0,0,t1_i2ka8un,i2ka8un,False,jordipg,t3_tqep6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/tqep6c/why_are_durhams_libraries_closed_on_sundays/,Why are Durham's libraries closed on Sundays?,/r/bullcity/comments/tqep6c/why_are_durhams_libraries_closed_on_sundays/i2ka8un/,4,r/bullcity,0,4

"If you want more service you need to pressure the county to give us more staff and compensate that staff for losing a pretty big perk, not just “find people willing and able”, which sounds a lot like firing the current staff. As a library worker I can’t get on board with that for obvious reasons, but it’s also impractical and not going to get you a better library. 

It sounds simple to replace everyone because the library job market is so competitive, but it’s not that easy. Filling a position in the library takes a very long time and the county had massive turnover during the pandemic so they’re currently scrambling to stop more people from quitting. Many people you’d like to replace are qualified, experienced professionals whose loss would hurt the library, undermine morale even further, and cause even more disruptions to our services. Offering guaranteed Sundays off is a cheap bone to throw workers who are grumpy, burned out, and underpaid. What makes a job a “sweet gig for new librarians” isn’t getting to work in a cool building in a hip town, it’s boring things like pay, benefits, and working conditions. If you want to increase the workload without improving those things, it won’t be a sweet gig anymore.

"Coming from a place of respect for your thoughts and those of library staff generally,  please help me understand your thoughts about weekends a bit more.

Public libraries are most valuable during evenings and weekends, particularly as concerns children.  It's hard for me to understand why it is not a top priority of the county and state governments to have libraries open late into the night and all weekend long to keep kids busy doing constructive stuff.  Surely librarians share this view?

There are many professions that involve working on weekends, and people go into those professions willingly and with eyes open.

"Delta 8 hemp flower. The same experience as what you've seen in legal dispensaries in Colorado. Cute names like ""Cookie Kush"" - what makes you sleepy, what makes you chatty. 

Upside, no tobacco products (when i was there) and no vape stuff other than the D8/CBD cartridges.

YMMV, but i roasted an entire bud of the ""cookie kush"" - experienced relaxation, but not inebriation. My partner ate half of a candy and went to bed at 9:30.

"As has been stated elsewhere, the county commissioners and the county manager are ultimately responsible for the budgets.

In my experience, no one at the library wants to work weekends period. They work Saturdays because they're required to. I think given a pay increase, and staffing increases so they'd need less coverage would make it less stressful. Other surrounding counties pay part time workers for staff coverage, specifically for weekend and night coverage instead of expecting librarians to cover odd, low usage hours. 

Please keep in mind that librarians are required to have a Masters Degree, and are getting paid roughly $40k a year. They're smart people in a field that demands they sacrifice financial gain for job security and public service.

Who should I complain to about Durham County library budgets?

>Giving the staff one guaranteed weekend day off is an important concession for what little morale they have left, and helps with budgeting.

In my experience, employees have a variety of preferences and lifestyles, and working on the weekend is a preferred, good fit for some.

Do you think that with additional staffing and support there would be a desire to fill those Sunday slots?  Or do you think librarians and staff prefer Sundays off in any case?",t2_c53o0,jordipg,0,1648515194.0,0,t1_i2ia3jm,i2ia3jm,False,jordipg,t3_tqep6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/bullcity/comments/tqep6c/why_are_durhams_libraries_closed_on_sundays/,Why are Durham's libraries closed on Sundays?,/r/bullcity/comments/tqep6c/why_are_durhams_libraries_closed_on_sundays/i2ia3jm/,12,r/bullcity,0,12
