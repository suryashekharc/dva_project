"St.Thomas has the same issues as everywhere else. The west end can be a little daunting at night if you’re not accustomed to the types of people who frequent that area. Most are harmless and struggle with mental health and addictions but keep to themselves. But on the other hand there’s a few who can get a little unruly and loud but honestly there’s really nothing located at the west end that would have you visiting that area frequently. Rent has been rising here for a few years now and a single bedroom apartment can cost upwards of $1400 a month. 
I’m sure you will enjoy the city and find it has a lot of hidden gems.

"I don't know the others, but I follow Grace Cafe on Facebook and I'm super impressed with Grace and the whole staff there.

They feed anyone who shows up and as far as I can tell, that includes a lot of older people who have nothing to do with drugs or homelessness, but who might not eat anything that day.

The Grace Cafe has offered to help get anyone who wants to go into recovery, into Teen Challenge, including paying for it (it was aprox $10K 12 years ago FYI).  I believe thier new annex is for this purpose (I'm not 100% sure).

Nothing in a homeless persons life is ""easy"".  Especially not eating, sleeping and staying high - thier whole life is a struggle to live and not be sick.

I'm not sure what the solution is - there was a study done in London recently where they gave homeless addicts thier drugs of choice, and once they didn't  have to spend all day every day acquiring drugs so they don't get sick, a large percentage of them found jobs and homes, some even went into recovery...   I could see a lot of people objecting this idea since it goes against what we would commonly think, which is that to solve these problems we need to remove the drugs.

People keep comparing us to the States but they have privatized Healthcare so if you get sick it's in their best interest to get you in the hospital and drain your bank account. They just don't care as long as it doesn't take their economy. Up here it does both. I will probably say that there are a small group of people in these protests that had peaceful protests in mind but it's not what it ended up being. It was a platform to bring out all the crazies. Hearing people getting death threats for walking down the street in Ottawa wearing a mask because in their thought that was truly uncanadian where they fight for a freedom to either wear a mask or not it is just so hypocritical and their messages lost. Like I said we all want the same thing, but a lot of us were frustrated watching these things thinking that it's going to make the lockdown go longer.

"One incident a few years ago. If you Google any small town news from anywhere in the country, there's always one whack job making the front page. Hopefully the local economy picks up. The downtown area has a lot of potential if people would start renting out those spaces for good businesses or restaurants. The city has grown considerably by way of folks moving out of the GTA and settling in the southeast. Ourselves included. With the white collar work from home types, comes more demand for bistros and other crap well off bored people buy. Honestly, in lieu of a Homesense, someone could make a killing reselling last year's home decor around here.

I just look to the small town I grew up in - Belleville. Not much larger than St. T. In highshool it was grimy and unkempt. Downtown was where you went if you wanted to drag race your mom's Saturn or score drugs. Almost 20 years have past, but it's actually a nice place to sit down now for some live music on a patio.

Its unacceptable. I saw so many ppl struggling yesterday who have no choice but to walk in foot deep snow. And yet I keep hearing how great our city is yet all I see is drug addiction and homelessness and houses that are worth twice what they should be going for. Not to mention the shitty hospital and doctors offices in the city. But dont worried I smoked lots of that weed but it wasnt to calm down it was from being in extreme pain from having to walk through a foot of snow to get to my doctors office but thanks for letting us know a kind person plowed your sidewalk cause it sure as hell wasnt a city plow,t2_7oza6q3t,Canadianweedrules420,0,1642513722.0,0,t1_ht6byl2,ht6byl2,False,Canadianweedrules420,t3_s68x9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/s68x9u/its_noon_on_monday_and_the_snow_hasnt_been/,Its noon on Monday and the snow hasnt been falling very hard for hours now and yet our sidewalks have yet to be plowed.

2. My significant other's bike was dropped off the same day.   The brake squealing never did disappear after they put new pads on.  Nor was it even mentioned after they replaced the pads, that the squeal would essentially remain.

**Sidewalk Cleaning**  
Generally, sidewalk snow plowing will commence when the snow has accumulated to 15 cm. The time that plowing commences may vary due to time of day and available manpower, and is normally carried out during regular working hours. The priority by which sidewalks are plowed is:  
  
i) all arterial roads and designated school areas with sidewalks receive first priority  
  
ii) upon completion of i) above, all other sidewalks shall be plowed following designated routes when manpower and equipment are available.

Anyway, fast forward, we got a cat, she was super aggressive and ended up having to give her up after one too many run ins with our daughter. But same thing. The animal rights folks would have rather euthanized her than declaw her.

"Please tell your friend to do proper research on declawing and learn about the absolutely detrimental effect it has on cats. You're basically mutilating an innocent animal just because you're not willing to put the effort in to make them comfortable. That's called being a shitty pet owner. There are so many other alternatives to avoid the issue the cat may be posing. But declawing is not one of them. In fact, most often than not, declawing makes a cat's behavior worse than when it does have claws. Just do the research. It's inhumane for a reason.

"I know Aylmer Vet clinic won’t do it… 
 my buddy had a cat that literally attacked his children almost daily, destroyed furniture and was such a bastard, you had to throw a towel over him to catch him and get him in a carrier.  If you tried to pet him he  would latch onto your arm with his claws and bite the ever-living-shit out of your wrist.
  He thought that if they could declaw the cat, maybe they could keep him and at least know that he wasn’t going to gouge the eyes out if his kids (which almost happened once).
   Aylmer vet said no, we won’t declaw him because it’s cruel… but suggested that he euthanize the e cat instead.  
   How fucked is that?  Somehow it’s now more cruel to declaw a cat than to murder it!? We were both shocked by that.

"From Wikipedia: 95.5% of the population is white, 1.2% Indigenous, and 3.3% visible minorities. I think this data is from the 2006 census, though I’m not certain and didn’t look into it further.

I’ve just moved back to St. Thomas this year and, anecdotally, have noticed a more diverse population here than there was when I was in high school a decade ago.

I would recommend either Central Elgin Collegiate Institute (CECI) or St. Joseph’s Catholic High School. Central is traditionally the most academically minded high school in town and still strives to deserve that reputation. It’s also rather a small school, which may help to encourage a stronger sense of community. St. Joe’s also has good academics and the added benefit of a religious community if Catholicism appeals to you. Both schools have good teachers, good athletics and other extra curriculars, and mostly good kids.

I may upset some people by saying so, but I would not recommend Parkside Collegiate Institute or Arthur Voaden Secondary School for myriad reasons, especially not Voaden.

">Did it not take will power for you to make those decisions day after day? If not, what would you call it?

Yes.  AFTER I quit willpower works.  I'm saying it doesn't work in the middle of active addiction.

I am disagreeing with the basic concept that someone can decide to quit and then just do so.  I've never actually run into any of these types of people at rehab or afterword IRL, so it's kind of like the unicorn to me.  The whole concept that you just decide to quit, then do so without outside help.

Telling someone to quit or deciding for them is pointless.  IF they want to stop, they will seek out those services.  We have no idea if OP actually wants to stop.  Obviously, this desire to stop isn't strong enough to find and use recovery services, so there is little point in telling them they need to quit - I'm 100% sure that the OP knows he should quit.",t2_j2qc6,gogomom,0,1639429718.0,0,t1_hofe63g,hofe63g,False,[deleted],t3_rf8be1,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/rf8be1/please_help_me_i_live_on_talbot_i_have_31_dollars/,please help me i live on talbot i have 31 dollars im im in withdrawal i need alcohol i need liquor i think i am dying i dont know what to do,/r/stthomasontario/comments/rf8be1/please_help_me_i_live_on_talbot_i_have_31_dollars/hofe63g/,1,r/stthomasontario,0,1

I refuse to limit peoples possibilities. I did that to myself for most of my life and decided to surround myself with people that made me believe I had control over my life.

My point remains the same. It is a choice. You said ""it didn't matter how much willpower I may have for other things, when I truly wanted to put the bottle down, I couldn't ""just make that choice."" That right there says it all.

"I never said there were no choices.  This person COULD choose to go to the hospital and detox, go to rehab,  get a recovery program going, etc.  

Unfortunately, those choices aren't what a brain is going to pick in active addiction.  It's all fine and dandy to say these things, but reality is something totally different.

It's like saying to an overweight person to just eat better and exercise more.  Unless they want it more than anything else, it just isn't going to happen.  One thing you cannot do, is make someone else want something.

Hell - I can clearly recall waking up in the morning and telling myself ""I'm not going to drink today"", driving to work, having lunch working all day telling myself ""I'm not going to drink today"", driving home from work telling myself ""I'm not going to drink today""  pulling in my driveway and sucking out of the bottle of vodka telling myself ""I'm not going to drink today""....   it didn't matter what I told myself, it didn't matter how much willpower I may have for other things, when I truly wanted to put the bottle down, I couldn't ""just make that choice"".

"Alcoholism, once your in it, isn't a choice.  The brain is rewired and new pathways are made so when an alcoholic says they need a drink, it's the same as you needing food when your hungry or water when your thirsty.

"    Yes there certainly are regulations.  You may no longer have downpipes buried to drain into the sewer system (as of 2017 or so) and you may not have downpipes drain in such a way that floods your neighbours property.  It is the homeowners responsibility to ensure that their water flows on such a grade as to not cause damage to other’s property.  
   If you can’t rectify the issue in a civil manner with your neighbour, you may have to call a city by-law officer to come and intervene.  
   Source:  I used to do a lot of commercial/residential eavestrough work (both new  homes and older buildings) here in town and we were always very conscious of where the trough drained.

"We just moved here last year and while we enjoy the city it would be difficult to get around without a car. But part of that is where we chose to move- the extreme south east edge of the city. We like it because we can see a field from the back of our house. But a car is close to mandatory in this neighborhood.

Take a look at where your placement is compared to say Walmart or Superstore where you'll be able to get most of your essentials while you're here. Can you walk it? Are you on a single bus line? Do you mind hoofing it in the winter? Can you find an apartment that's walking distance from both a grocery store and your job?

A question for people that have lived here for a while would be how the cab service is? What if you have an emergency and need to get somewhere quickly? I've tried Uber a few times since we moved here and there's always a significant wait. Maybe hailing a cab would be faster, I haven't tried.

Do you have any family friends in St. Thomas you can fall back on in the event of a bad weather situation or emergency? Or are you on your own?

There are benefits to either decision. By staying in London I assume you've got an established network of friends or family, but your  transportation costs will skyrocket. By moving here even though there are cabs and little shuttle busses, you'll be on a bit of an island without quick and reliable transportation at your disposal.

I don't have anything negative to say about the city having come from Toronto. We really like it here and plan to stay. Just make sure you've got your transportation ducks in a row before you commit. We have one car and 364 days a year we only need that one car. But on that 365th day man.. let me tell you it sucks hoofing it in the snow with 6 bags of groceries because you can't get a cab or an Uber and the bus doesn't make it to where you live.",t2_jj0azz,brentemon,0,1631200375.0,0,t1_hc6u7cg,hc6u7cg,True,PrizeLeast,t3_pkpnsz,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/pkpnsz/should_i_move_in_to_stthomas/,Should I move in to St.Thomas ?,/r/stthomasontario/comments/pkpnsz/should_i_move_in_to_stthomas/hc6u7cg/,3,r/stthomasontario,0,3
"Cheaper rent here than in London in most cases. We have transit, you can look up the routes at your fingertips to see if any come close to where you work and live. I haven’t taken one in 35yrs. You can bike across town in 15 min. 4800 is a lot to waste on someone else to get you around. We have the same problems as a big city to, just on a smaller scale and sometimes more in your face if you live in certain areas in the core. We have some good food in town, sushi, Japanese fusion, Thai, shawarma, bbq, and the normal fast food places. It smells better here to…….in my opinion. I work in London and can smell the difference starting at the Wellington rd mc Donald’s before the 401, it’s like a thick, greasy, fast food fries smell mixed with exhaust.

"We're happy we landed here over London just because we feel it's nicer. Plus closer to the beach. My in laws are in London so when we visited them in the summer we'd usually take our little girl down to Port Stanley. So being 15 minutes away is a nice perk.

London's drivers don't really bother me, but my perspective compares driving around here to my old commute, which was up and down the DVP twice a day.

"More or less, yup. But I feel less bad about it because we didn't buy to flip or rent out for income. Just for a quieter more affordable place to live! 

We were actually shooting for London thinking that it would be less of an adjustment coming from Toronto, but soon learned that bidding 100k over asking didn't come close to cutting it. Our relator suggested buying a townhouse directly from a builder here to avoid the bidding wars. So we ended up with less property than I'd have wanted, but my wife was able to track down a brand new freehold on the end of a row. So we've got more house than we would have for less than if we won any of those London bids. And I've come to terms with less yard. Between winter and two full time jobs, I've realized having a larger inside space is more important than an outdoor space if I can't have both. My wife's already decided that if we upgrade down the road she wants to stay in this town. 

Anyway, thanks for the welcome, Brent! We're really enjoying it. Making a lot of friends, meeting suspiciously friendly people, and my daughter loves that we can drive around and spot farms.

" From Milk = Scriptures for the Baby once-born Disciples to Flesh of Jesus = Gospel for the Twice-born capable of logical reasoning. https://youtu.be/b\_PSncpz7iA Brethren in Christ = Satguru Jesus, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR ANOINTED ELDER BROTHER/BRIDEGROOM CHRIST JESUS, PLEASE PASS THIS ON TO YOUR FRIENDS. If you read John 4 in-depth, you will know that the Samaritans were very glad to receive Jesus in their village whereas the “Saltless sons of Satan”, the Jews outwardly instead of “Inwardly” as the Samaritans were, then you will appreciate the difference between the people of “Salt”, faithful to Abraham and Yahweh “Wheat Plants” and the “Saltless” Temple Priests unfaithful to Abraham and Yahweh, the “Tares” – Matt 13v24-30 is being fulfilled today. Here is something for you to ponder over:- From Judaism born of water + 7 to Christianity born of the holy spirit + 5 = 12 TANN (Physical tribal body = 7) + MUNN (Mind, Nafs, etc. = 5) = 12 Purified (Nirmall) https://youtu.be/zNtyGuUbwuA  - Where two or three Virgin Brides (Christs = Royal Priests) are gathered together, our Bridegroom is among us. Please pass on to our Brethren this article. If you send me your email, I will send you occasional once or twice a year such updates.  David’s Cross of secular works, social, economic and political, in Yahweh, Brahma, Khuda, etc., the demiurge creator of the natural “Potts” into which the “soul” of our Supernatural Father Elohim, Allah, Parbrahm, etc. is infused to make the Pott living. These natural once-born men, the Disciples, are led by a Moses’ Priest – Matt 13v52 – that leads to the kingdom of heaven in law and order. The works performed gives you the next birth called “Reincarnation”. Evil-works give you leprosy whilst the evil greedy Priests end up as “Snakes” as John, the Baptist called the Temple Priests, a Brood of Vipers. People of the holy works carry their credit into the next human birth to earn more treasures that Christ Jesus came to collect from the Temple Priests (Parable of the Winepress – the School of theology) to please our Supernatural Father to bless you with the holy spirit to become a Whip Master for the Rabbis, a Prophet Elijah as John, the Baptist was the Last One in the Promised Land – Luke 16v16 or a Christ/Bhagat to sing the praises of our Supernatural Father Elohim represented by the Middle Candle of the Menorah that is raised above the other Six in honour of Christ Jesus. The other six candles of works evil or holy are represented by David’s Cross of two triangles opposite each other. When the Rabbis become hypocrites and crooks, then the hue and cry of people (the Bud swells to welcome Christ Jesus – Shepherdless people) makes Elohim send His Own Anointed Son “Christ”, to Preach the Bottom-line Absolute Gospel Truth called the “Oral Torah”, to give life to people with Buds swelling up to receive their Bridegroom Christ in their hearts, to bear “Fruit” for Resurrection by grace as demonstrated by Christ Jesus in His Friend in Lazarus. Christ Jesus picked up the 12 Labourers for the Royal Kingdom of Elohim, Allah, Parbrahm, etc., that has a Low for humble and Narrow for the “solitary” Gate and by Feeding them His Flesh, He prepared them to Preach the Gospel Truth from the Roof Tops called Drinking the Blood of Christ to become part of Jesus, the “Virgin Bride”. This, Jesus, stressed after feeding the 5000 with highly delicious food provided by the Lord of Nature demiurge Potter Yahweh and He compared it with Manna of repentance that was provided by Moses in the wilderness. Thus, the 12 Labourers of Jesus had nothing to do with the 12 tribes of Israel but with the “KUNBH MAELA” of the naked Sadhus, who are not under the Law but Holy Spirit as Sadhu Melchizedek was a Royal Priest. They were made up of:- 7 – In the name Prophet Elijah, John, the Baptist for morality – Law – Luke 16v16 leading to re-incarnation according to the works – KARMI AAWAE KAPRRA – Physical body. 5 – of heart in the name of Christ Jesus for spirituality leading to Resurrection by the grace of our Supernatural Father Elohim – NADRIN MOOKH DAWAAR – The Narrow Gate. = 12 = TANN AND MUNN NIRMALL – Purity of the physical body – born of water and the mind, Nafs, etc. born of the Holy Spirit, Our Mother MAHADEVAN.

"North of Talbot, the older part of st. Thomas can be sketchy in areas, near redan. But it's similar to Toronto in the way that part of a street can be bad then two blocks over it's really nice. There's alot of cool heritage homes in the older parts that are well kept and some that are not. When I was a kid I would avoid Talbot and Ross Street. But Ross Street is being gentrified now and might be considered up and coming. I'd suggest the new subdivisions if you can swing it, there's the Lyndhurst area to the north east, lake Margaret (south of aldoburough) is nice and new. It's near st.joes/Fanshawe school) and has alot of newer homes and what not.  the subdivisions  to the northwest that has a lot of parks up there, like password park, a retirement home and new apartments. There is a newish subdivision on the southern part of sunset, but it's kinda bad cause it's wedged between the sewage plant and a very large pyschaitric hospital. Mostly the sewage plant is the issue since it smells if the wind goes south, but it's good to know what the hospital is too. Sunset is nice cause of its location to the parks and has some neat old homes there.

Oh sure they put in a new side walk and a few benches but they dont get used bc there homeless ppl everywhere.  And what cool artsy and cultured things. We have one small shittt art gallery and some graffiti art and ohhhh old buildings pretty much every single city has these. Wanna look at nice and taken care of old Victorian buildings go to coburg that's how a nice quaint old city looks. St thomas is a drug infested sore and there's nothing here for the young.

"We just made the move from Toronto to St. Thomas a few months ago. We were in East York by Woodbine Subway Station and have settled in nicely in our new small town.

I thought there would be a big adjustment and had a few mild bouts of regret making the trip down here to ""the middle of nowhere"" checking in on our new build while it was going up. But honestly we settled in pretty much immediately and I don't have that feeling of isolation I thought I might have. Walkability is an issue, but that's got more to do with the fact that we're living in a new development in what was once a field. Seems like other locations in the city would offer some nice walk scores.

Everything we need is a 10 minute drive from the house, we've discovered a few nice favorite take out places, and are making connections fast. Everyone seems to be friendly and approachable.

"I've lived here since my parents moved us here when I was a child. My husband is speaking about wanting to move up north and I'm having a hard time imagining not having St Thomas as my home. It has its issues of course, it is a city with homelessness and drugs and everything else every other city has but it also has a dedicated mayor and city council and community trying to help, it has shelters  and a plan. The police are trying to step up their game, my parents shed was broke into last month and the cops showed up (it took a couple hours but it's not like the person was still there and them showing up any earlier was going to help and they have other important things to do) and they did look into it and they did find some of the tools that were taken and called a couple weeks later. We have lived on the quiter end of a main Street  for 14 years and never had anything stolen. It is not as culturally diverse as we would like (especially if coming from Toronto) we even signed our kids up for sports in London and this was one of the reasons BUT the last five years this has started to really change. It's true some things are changing as we grow, some good and some bad, our houses have become much more expensive then 5 years ago and so we have some homelessnedd (which we had almost none of not to long ago) and some drugs on the streets but like I said the city has developed a pretty good plan. But We have everything you need and more, we have all the stores, and art galleries and museums and good schools and great restaurants, beautiful parks and hiking trails and walking trails and if something isn't here, London is 15 minutes away (Costco lol)  We really are a great city and a perfect and safe place to raise children (mine are now 16-22).

"To build onto your experience with the police not being helpful:
I lived there for a few years and left in my early 20s, not long after having my apartment B&E'd. It was a four minute walk from the police station but they took hours to show up. I hadn't touched the scene and my place was ransacked. They finally showed up, didn't stay long, and told me that unless I had seen the person who did it, there was nothing they could do. I asked if they were going to take finger prints or investigate, and they told me it wasn't CSI.

That said, I follow their FB page and it looks like they're really trying now. I do like that they've brought on mental health workers, as the city really, really, REALLY needs it.

I can vouch for this as a long time downtown area renter. My home was broken into 6 times at the one place and the cops.pftt dont think they will help you either. If they show up they will tell you there's not much they can do. I know live on talbot st and have drug addicts in my stairwell every day and bc we have our mail there we cant lock them out and the police wont remove them. If they catch a thief stealing from stores they dont arrest them. They make them give it back and ban them from the store. The gentleman who owned the discount max had to sell his business bc thieves kept stealing and when  he caught them the cops do nothing. Unless your a good citizen who breaks the law then they will throw the book at you. And if you have teenagers there's nothing to keep kids busy. The parks are small and rundown and the one decent park has a small play area and splash pad that get packed during busy seasons. Then there's the house costs. Maybe they aren't as bad as Toronto but it's getting ridiculous in this town and when the crash comes and it will come your house will drop in value 25% at least. I'm sure most towns have these types of issues but not all of them in one small town.

"St Thomas as a whole isn’t terrible, we have our issues with regular petty shed robberies and car break ins.

"LONDON, ONT. -- A St. Thomas, Ont. family is desperate for help after losing everything they own in a house fire Jan. 28.

After putting a load in the laundry, Sherry Lynn Abbey's 10-year-old daughter smelled smoke coming from downstairs of their Park Ave. home.

""I looked in basement and flames were coming up and smoke was starting to pour we had just seconds to get out of there,"" says Abbey

Since Thursday the Red Cross has put them up in a local motel room, but Abbey says that funding runs out Monday morning.

""I didn't have tenant insurance as my insurance agent said to wait, but never got back into it,"" says Abbey.

""I wish I did because it would have covered contents of house. Unfortunately I need a place to live that's my biggest concern right now, for me and my kids to have a place to call our own again.""

Some helpful resources to people that are looking into N95 alternatives, such as KN95 and KF94. N95 are still meant to reserve for healthcare workers.

* [FDA EUA / Appendix A](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-emergency-use-authorizations-medical-devices/personal-protective-equipment-euas) on KN95 and KF94 manufacturers.
* [CDC NPPTL Respirator Assessment Results](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/respirators/testing/NonNIOSHresults.html) for legitimate and official mask testings.
* [Counterfeit or self-claimed NIOSH approved](https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npptl/usernotices/counterfeitResp.html) for pictures of counterfeits.

If you are ever looking into legitimate KN95 sources.

I have found teachers to be as helpful as they can possibly be but as you said hands are tied sometimes with what they can and can't do then you move on to administration and you either get someone who actually cares or someone whose taken the role as principal to the point they just need their numbers and stats to look good on paper and to hell with whether they actually help. I unfortunately have gotten not much but politically correct answers from all involved. I explained to the superintendent I will be happy when I actually see something done. She stated she'd contact the principal and make a plan to have him contact the principal directly if there was issues...but thats already in place in the meantime the bully still hasn't had any consequences for his actions in 4 years...so I asked when he reports it to the principal will the child actually be disciplined for his actions and all I got was the speech that they practice progressive discipline and blah blah blah no answer one way or another. Needless to say progressive discipline isn't working and they can't be so blind as to not see that. This is why I feel the push needs to be to the board. They can make decisions they can change policies they can put the legwork in to make things happen its just a matter of staying on their backs about it and not backing down.,t2_97nhvuo8,Kristen_T,0,1607374387.0,0,t1_gezewb7,gezewb7,False,[deleted],t3_k8nywq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/k8nywq/please_sign_and_share/,Please sign and share!,/r/stthomasontario/comments/k8nywq/please_sign_and_share/gezewb7/,1,r/stthomasontario,0,1

"We moved in to TVDSB not too long ago and our kids were pretty shocked at how commonplace violence was.  Public school has been a nightmare - our children have endured everything: verbal, physical, and yes, sexual assault IN the classroom (the latter was not at TVDSB) - honestly, COVID was the straw that broke the camels back and we now home school.

I'll say that I don't think these issues are unique to TVDSB at all, and so I can't agree with the other poster that this is just a principal/school issue.  It is systemic, cultural (where we came from, my daughter was repeatedly harassed because we are atheists, students in the classroom would tease her all day and one even followed her around as she tried to change seats at lunch, bringing her to tears telling her she's going to suffer in hell forever -- the school had no game plan, they had no idea how to deal with this and didn't see a non-religious person as capable of being bullied this way) and needs far more attention and consideration than it is being given.",t2_ck11i,daveinsurgent,0,1607373649.0,0,t1_gezde7q,gezde7q,True,[deleted],t3_k8nywq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/k8nywq/please_sign_and_share/,Please sign and share!,/r/stthomasontario/comments/k8nywq/please_sign_and_share/gezde7q/,1,r/stthomasontario,0,1

That poor girl is on medications now living with anxiety and depression and the only reason it stopped is because she finally graduated from the school and they went to different high schools.

"**Hello.**

I noticed you dropped 4 f-bombs in this comment. This might be necessary, but using nicer language makes the whole world a better place.

Maybe you need to blow off some steam - in which case, go get a drink of water and come back later. This is just the internet and sometimes it can be helpful to cool down for a second.

"This is like saying we no longer need to wear seat belts because automobile fatalities are down.  The preventative measures are the reason for the data you are attempting to use as an argument against them.

""Freedom"" is not an unbound, unrestricted concept, for the same reason you can't falsely yell ""fire"" in a crowded room, public health restrictions are in place to protect the greater good.  I could even get behind protesting, while still respecting the distancing and public health measures such as wearing masks.

If this were a case where these individuals could, for example, yield their public health access for treatment and take on the responsibility entirely personally, that would be one thing, but they can't. In fact, I sincerely doubt many of these people protesting are even net tax payers, they don't have any leverage here, they are neither being directly targeted nor are they capable of shouldering the burden their actions create on their own. It is a social, moral, and hopefully found to be illegal display of callous shortsightedness.

These arguments are neither novel or unique, a very short amount of time thinking about the bigger picture instead of hitching your wagon to populist nonsense would allow you to arrive at them on your own.",t2_ck11i,daveinsurgent,0,1605118812.0,0,t1_gbyi2ic,gbyi2ic,False,[deleted],t3_jsckv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/jsckv4/freedom_rally_saturday_nov_14_at_the/,Freedom Rally - Saturday Nov 14 at the St.Thomas-Elgin memorial center @11 am.

"Local Conservative MP Karen Vecchio is asking for privacy after she says a family member was arrested by St. Thomas police in a drug bust that resulted in the seizure of fentanyl and four guns.

Hours after police issued a news release about the arrest of two people, Vecchio posted a statement on Facebook.

“Sadly, I have a personal connection to this case as a family member has been arrested. I ask that the privacy of my family and I are respected at this difficult time.”

Vecchio, who represents Elgin-Middlesex-London, also thanked police for their “great work” in the investigation.

Late Friday afternoon, St. Thomas police made an unusual request and asked media outlets to remove information about the bust posted to their websites and refrain from publishing any further information about the case because of a publication ban put in place at a court hearing. Police removed the release from their website. A police spokesperson was unable to provide details about the publication ban.

The London Free Press, on the advice of its counsel, did not remove the story from its website.

Vecchio then issued a second statement: “As an elected official, I strongly believe in transparency. At no point did I or my family request a publication ban.”

St. Thomas police Chief Chris Herridge says the large drug bust and seizure of guns sends a message that police aren’t going to stop targeting drug dealers in the city.

Officers from the street crime and community patrol units searched a Talbot Street apartment on Thursday following a “lengthy” investigation, seizing $35,000 in drugs, $24,000 cash, four guns, an imitation firearm, a bulletproof vest, multiple knives and scales, police said.

“This investigation is a direct result of the ongoing commitment by members of the St. Thomas police service to crack down on drugs, guns and violent crime in our community,” Herridge said.

“The street values seized in this investigation are on par with our very successful Project Coppertone from 2018. Back then we said we would not relax our efforts on the drug subculture in the city and we haven’t. This large bust along with several smaller ones in between Coppertone and now have repeatedly put drug dealers in St. Thomas on notice.

“We will not let up.”

Project Coppertone was a nine-month investigation that led to dozens of arrests and nearly $500,000 worth of drugs seized, along with cash and weapons.

In this week’s bust, the serial numbers were scratched off three of the guns, while the fourth gun was outfitted with a barrel suppressor and a prohibited magazine, police said.

The seized drugs included 283 grams of fentanyl, an opioid that’s up to 100 times more powerful than heroin and has been linked to many fatal overdoses in Southwestern Ontario in recent years.

A man, 31, and woman, 22, were arrested at the scene and are being held in custody. The pair is charged with a combined 78 offences including production of a controlled substance, drug possession for the purpose of trafficking, tampering with a serial number on a firearm, possession of a restricted firearm and breaching probation.",t2_cwgizl5,st_thomas_hello,0,1593829475.0,0,t1_fwv6zbe,fwv6zbe,True,st_thomas_hello,t3_hkvpsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/hkvpsq/mp_asks_for_privacy_as_family_member_arrested_in/,"MP asks for privacy as family member arrested in drug bust, police seek removal of news",/r/stthomasontario/comments/hkvpsq/mp_asks_for_privacy_as_family_member_arrested_in/fwv6zbe/,2,r/stthomasontario,0,2
"LONDON, ONT. -- The City of St. Thomas suffered a big blow Monday when Marriott International told employees they will be closing their local call centre this September.

Employees at the St. Thomas centre, known as Starwood, were told by video conference Monday morning that they will be losing their jobs.

In a statement, Elgin-Middlesex-London MPP Jeff Yurek said the news is very unfortunate for the community.

“I have spoken with the Ministers of Labour and Heritage, Tourism, Culture and Sport Industries requesting that all possible supports be made available to those facing job losses. I will continue to work with Mayor [Joe] Preston and local economic development stakeholders to promote our region’s many advantages,” he added.

Speaking in a general update on Facebook, Preston said it was disappointing news from Marriott.

""We will, as a city, do all we can for the employees of the Marriott Call Centre and the owner of the building. Our economic development corporation is already on it today, I’ve been on the phone a number of times today. As community we are waiting for more information, but I’m here to say we'll be there St. Thomas strong with them.""

Marriott says the permanent shut down will affect approximately 480 associates, and while some will be able to shift to working remotely, many positions will be eliminated.

Associates whose jobs will be lost will receive severance, continued benefits and other forms of assistance to aid in their career transition.",t2_cwgizl5,st_thomas_hello,0,1593468839.0,0,t1_fwewusl,fwewusl,True,st_thomas_hello,t3_hia4yw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stthomasontario/comments/hia4yw/st_thomas_call_centre_closure_leaves_480_out_of/,St. Thomas call centre closure leaves 480 out of work,/r/stthomasontario/comments/hia4yw/st_thomas_call_centre_closure_leaves_480_out_of/fwewusl/,1,r/stthomasontario,0,1

"STPS Presents......THE TRUTH

We all know social media is the best and worst place to find information.

Everyone from leading experts to your talking dog can upload a post.

Most of the time it's easy to recognize what's serious and what's silly....but sometimes the lines get blurred and that is how misinformation begins.

Watch where you source your information. Only take it from professional, official sites......like ours!

So in response to a currently circulating post about STPS Officers stopping people to see why they are out driving and supposedly directing you to go home if your reason is deemed non essential........the post is:

NOT TRUE.

During this pandemic staying home means staying safe. But if you need to escape the confines of home by going for a drive, then by all means GO AHEAD but just drive! Don't go to an essential store to browse and pass the time.

Need a morning walk/ jog to help you cope with the day ahead? LACE UP.

Just please please please use common sense. Don't cram a bunch of people into the vehicle. Don't jog in a group. Practice physical distancing at all times. Wash your hands.

"First, St. Thomas is an awesome community.  I've been in a lot of towns, and St Thomas has some of the most caring, giving people I've met, and they're not rare here.  Our town has its challenges, but there are good people here working hard to constantly improve things.

Legends is good - not great, but good - and has consistent food & service.
Your Fish & Chips - awesome fish & chips, cash only
Railway City Bistro has the best food in St Thomas.  The atmosphere doesn't do their food justice.

We have two breweries - Railway City Brewing on Edward Street, and Caps Off on the south side of Curtis St near the Library/City Hall.  Caps Off has awesome beer.

The Elgin Centre used to be a nearly empty mall that was bought a few years ago by a family that has been investing in it - check it out and go regularly to see what's new there.

Our downtown has awesome, interesting shops.  Check out Myrtle on Talbot by Ross St, Dark Matter Toys & Collectibles on Ross St south of Wellington, and the myriad of shops between St George St & Ross St.

Speaking of Ross St, there's a cool business there called ""Salt & Pepper Foods"" - they provide prepared home cooked style meals for those days you don't have time to cook for the family.

If you are looking for any home electronics, Century Sound at Talbot & Inkerman is amazing.  They know their stuff, and the prices are great.

Make sure you visit both Pinafore Park & Waterworks Park.  They are the jewels of the city.

The STEAM Centre has awesome day camps and programming for kids and youth, all about Science, Technology, Engineering, Art & Math.  Check out the St Thomas-Elgin Public Arts Centre on Talbot near Pearl St too.  For teens, the Talbot Teen Centre (Talbot St near Horton St) is a cool drop-in centre, and they're going to be adding a lot of new things in the next 6-12 months.

If you're looking for a service club in town, the Kinsmen/Kinettes & Optimists are the best ones, especially if you're under 40.  Rotary is also a great club.

If you're on Facebook, follow the City of St Thomas, St. Thomas Police, Mayor Joe Preston, St Thomas Happenings, Establish Media, the St Thomas Times-Journal and 94.1 MyFM.  You'll get a good idea of what's going on in town - just don't read the comments (which is good advice for pretty much anything on Facebook).

If you need any help with any Provincial or Federal gov't issues, our MPP & MP offices are in the Canada Southern (CASO) Building on Talbot at Manitoba St, on the second floor.  Check out the history of that building too, and of the Elgin County Railway Museum, which is just south-east of it.

Stop by Railway City Tourism, tell them you're new to the city, and ask what events happen throughout the year - there a a LOT of awesome events that take place (Railway City Arts Crawl, Beerlesque & Carnivale, Iron Horse, Canada Day, etc).

There's a ton I've missed, but this is all I can think of right now.

"I'm a semi new St.Thomas resident (almost 2 years), food is one of my least favourite things about St. Thomas.

I see a lot mentions of Legends, the food is alright but the service is horrendous. We've been pretty much abandoned/ignored the last two times we were in there, so now we won't be back.

Braxton's I thought was good for a sports bar though I've only been once. I liked Bella Jacks food was good, service was very nice, though it is slightly more pricey.

Pizza in St Thomas is really a let down, Mikey's Pizzeria is prolly my favourite so far. We like the Open Kitchen, though we have not been since they moved when Chuck's opened.

I heard from a coworker that a Denny's is supposed to be opening in the mall plaza on Wellington, though I don't know how true that is or when.

The chip wagon at First and Edward, SnackWacky is pretty good, though I think they are now closed for the season. The other chip wagon at Briwood market on Talbot and Fairview/Burell cooks their fries really well, but the times we have had them they do not salt the fries after taking them out of the fryer. I don't know if this is their standard practice or just certain of the workers that do it. Their fries could be amazing if they were seasoned right.

The St. Thomas RoadHouse has been good the couple of time we've gone there. They had a turkey poutine special for Thanksgiving that was shockingly good. I just had no idea that adding turkey and stuffing to poutine would be any good.

Briwood market is a cool little store to shop at. It reminds me of the tiny IGA in Port Carling. I prefer going there to any of the other supermarkets in town. They seem to have a good selection of local produce, though I guess it's not as cheap as some of the chains.

Oh the Swiss Chalet in town is just awful.
