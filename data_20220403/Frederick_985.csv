"Thrill house is correct. 

Unfortunately,$5-$6K used cars that are actually Maryland inspected are few and far between. If fact, they were uncommon before the Covid madness took hold. Cars in that range should always be approached with suspicion; they may have dreadful histories, be repaired wrecks with salvage titles or have huge mileage on them. 

It’s depressing what even $10-$12 K buys you nowadays. I just helped a not-a-car-guy friend out who needed a car. That price range gets you well into the 150k mile club. Yea, the case can be made to go entry level new but THATS always a risk with young drivers. 

The only tip I have in this unusual time is: Use a refined search strategy on the major sites like KBB, AutoTrader, etc. Search the general region, not just 20 Miles from Frederick. 

Most importantly , zero in on “unloved” models. Low demand vehicles. Odd balls. You’re searching for the best combo of price, good history of maintenance, lowest miles and of course acceptable condition, preferably after an inspection by a trusted mechanic. Unloved cars are unpopular, low demand models, sometimes discontinued. Dodge Dart, old PT cruiser w/reasonable miles if you can find one. SUVs w 2WD. 2000-2005ish Buick LeSabres- popular choice with elderly gentlemen who often took amazing care of their cars w/ a solid drive trainTo sum it up, you need to possibly expand the budget and or find cars with low demand.

"When I bought my first car as a teen, I went to Fitzgerald's on 85. The was an older guy there who was genuine and steered me away from the speedy, more expensive car (rightly so, as a 18yr with a lead foot) to my first Honda that was easily 6k cheaper but more safe. No idea if he's still there, though. This was early 2000s.

I've heard Southmountain is also good. Decent prices, quality customer service. 

I wasn't impressed with Younger Nissan used cars section. Guy tried to sell me an overpriced CRV with sticky crap all over the inside and bothered me for three weeks after I told him I wasn't interested in anything.

"> which at this time the secondhand smoke laws do NOT apply, they're tobacco only, which obviously needs to change and should change before legalization happens.

I honestly didn't know this. I would 100% be okay with 2nd hand smoking laws applying to cannabis. It only makes sense, esspecially when there are ways to consume it without smoking or leaving a really smelly aftersmell (edibles, vaping, tinctures, etc.). I'm pretty high functional and can drive safetly when a bit high, but I would never do it on the belt way that shit is insane as is. The DUI laws should apply just like alcohol, and it should be up the officer to determine if the person is inebriated. Depending on the state, you can be arrested for a DUI if you're under the legal limit for blood alcohol content. TCH stays in ones system for a long time after usage, up to a month or more in some cases, so testing may not be the best way to determine if someone is driving impaired. The problem is trusting cops not to abuse their authority in this arena, its a really tough question made even harder by the optimized crazy high THC weed that is around now.

"I'm in favor of legalizing weed and regulating it just as alcohol is regulated, but, I effing hate the skunk stench and weed smoke clouds I have to walk through and drive through on my commute in DC.  I'm also not a fan of those who think weed doesn't affect driving ability, it does, and 5his is exacerbated by the fact many people can barely drive in a safe and non-reckless manner while stone sober, many people drive distracted as it is, and some weed is much stonger and getting moreso with new strains.

Their CS & sales reps keep pushing back their ETA in at least Golden Mile, Villa Estates, & Carrolton.

September '22 is the end of Glo's contractual 24 month initial buildout period, Winter '22 will miss it.

I think the only way to solve the problem you speak about is to disincentivize urban sprawl with drastically increased cost, like impact fees.

The Ryan homes townhouses are probably the highest density they’d be willing to accept.

And I say this knowing that I’m the exact same: we (as a country/species) need density for very, very valid ecological reasons, but I live in a (small) single family house with a (small) yard, and I wouldn’t go back to a typical multi-family unit unless I had absolutely no options.

I can’t imagine you could put a mid-rise in the historic district, and I’m not even sure if they’re allowed anywhere else in the city either. Or if theyre built, if there’d be much demand. Developers always want to build luxury condos with no low-income housing because that’s where the money is, and even if a portion of the units need to be dedicated to low-income housing, then the neighborhood freaks out about an influx of poors bringing down property values.

Went something like this: start with a base of soft (not fried) tortillas, atop which went a layer of refried beans, then shredded Monterey Jack (probably) cheese, and finally sliced jalapenos. Throw that under the broiler until the cheese bubbles, then wash it down with a cold Dos Equis dark they served (pretty novel for the time). I live in the west now with no shortage of quality, authentic tex-mex but nothing as good as that.

Everywhere else I've ever lived, the speed limit would be \~35-40 mph there, which even then is barely suitable for a major thoroughfare.

">It seems excessive

Well, I disagree with that--the library is a public resource and should be available to the public for free, inclusive of parking. I wouldn't be surprised if there were some kind of ordinance that mandated libraries have a certain amount of free parking. 

In terms of enforcement, I would say the primary mechanism is that the library will validate your parking ticket which will make your parking free, up to 2 hours. If you don't go to the library to get it validated, you'll pay the parking fee. Now, admittedly that doesn't police who parks in which spots. I've never seen the parking attendants do so either. Also, I've never seen someone park in a library spot and then fuck off in the other direction. It seems based on my experience that the ticket validation + honor system enforcement method broadly works.",t2_g66au7c7,kidwizbang,0,1648410192.0,0,t1_i2cn6sp,i2cn6sp,True,[deleted],t3_tpovnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/tpovnz/im_curious_about_the_carroll_creek_parking_garage/,I’m curious about the Carroll Creek parking garage.

"> Yes, they have wealth. But there are literally not enough people working these jobs to service the amount of people moving here right now. When a new client calls into my work, we turn them away because we are at capacity, like many many places. We don't ask ""well what's your net worth, I'll kick out a client with less money and replace them."" There are businesses in the area that have been open for 12 months that are at capacity and no longer taking new clients. 

I have never seen that happening to anyone. While I would never say something NEVER happens, I would be very surprised if there is some, according to you, BASIC service for children and pets that people can't get here and it NEEDS to be here. Again, covid has certainly caused problems that the entire nation is still recovering from but those are not frederick specific.

> You can't survive on specialty oil and vinegar.

Who in the shit is doing this? This seems like an incredibly weak argument considering you are basing this off, to my knowledge, two stores that offer more expensive oil and vinegar. People just go to the grocery store - I have never once heard a single person say they desperately need to get into the oil emporium but simply aren't being allowed to due to over crowding and under staffing.

Are you saying an economy can't survive on novelty stores? I mean, ok, but that's a different arguement and not one about basic human needs you keep repeating.

> You need teachers, childcare providers, healthcare providers, petcare providers, grocery store workers

Are you saying children are not being allowed to attend school?

Are you saying no one is being allowed to get into a hospital for emergency care (again - removing covid from the equation)?

Vets are everywhere and, depending on the issue, you may need to drive a little further to see one? All of this is normal in any area.

I have never not been allowed into a grocery store to purchase food I have needed. I have never heard of anyone who was turned away.

You claim people are being denied these basic services (at least I think you are saying this, you are honestly all over the place) but the only 'basic' service you seem to be able to come up with is someone being 'forced' to buy expensive novelty oil downtown. Perhaps you are confusing covid's long lasting effects with people moving to frederick but I honestly doubt it. You were very specific with your example of people needing to pay an up charge for novelty oil and vinegar.

Give me specific examples of what you are talking about (and not the oil one because that's just absurd). You seem all over the place so try and figure out what it is you are trying to say. Are you mad that wealthier people are moving here? Are you made more people in general are moving here? Are you mad that Covid really wrecked things? Are you mad that you literally think someone can't buy oil in a grocery store?

It is starting to sound like you are simply personally mad you think you are getting priced out of living here. BUT you are hiding it behind claims that 'people don't have access to basic needs'.

Looking through your posts I see you’re simply angry at not being able to afford a home in a particular location you want to live. You’re transferring that into passive aggressive comments like this. Look, I get it, you can’t afford to live where you want to but that’s all over the country. Plenty of people live here because they can’t afford anything near as nice in moco so they commute in. It doesn’t mean anyone is denied basic services.",t2_17fmj5,DavidOrWalter,0,1648302133.0,0,t1_i26w54u,i26w54u,False,Snoo-14069,t3_tnnwyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/tnnwyp/my_husband_and_i_are_planning_to_move_to_downtown/,My husband and I are planning to move to downtown Frederick.

It's really area dependent. When I lived near hood college I rarely had to go more than a half block away. E 2nd-5th might be different. I had a friend who lived on E 4th and he always parked right out front of his house.

It really depends on the specific block. But if you're used to DC or some other large city where you'd have to go 4ish blocks to find parking, then it's no big deal here.

">But I’m confused as shit by you stating that people paying a lot more for housing are supposedly not being told they will struggle for basic services and good for their kids or pets. Those people will never have a problem unless literally everyone will.

This just isn't complicated.

Yes, they have wealth. But there are literally not enough people working these jobs to service the amount of people moving here right now. When a new client calls into my work, we turn them away because we are at capacity, like many many places. We don't ask ""well what's your net worth, I'll kick out a client with less money and replace them."" There are businesses in the area that have been open for 12 months that are at capacity and no longer taking new clients. 

This would be a non issue if a proportionate amount of people who are qualified and able to run these services and provide these goods were also moving here. But it has become so unaffordable here that not only can these types of workers not move here, but the ones already here are being rapidly pushed out. 

This isn't some type of a judgement from me on wealthy people moving here. It's a completely unsustainable reality that will have to be grappled with regardless of whether people who haven't been confronted with it yet are able to admit it's happening.

>Let people move where they want and fuck off with the gate keeping shit.

">Both incorrect buddy.

Frankly, I don't believe this. I've lived here for 25 years and every single person I know here understands that working class people who do hands on services/work in the community being priced out within a 40 mile radius is a serious infrastructural issue for our community.

>If someone wants to move to Frederick, let them without questions their motivations lol.

I bring these issues up for several reasons. One of which is that I am considering whether to leave and find a different community to service and would like to hear from people moving to the community about who they are and what their thoughts are to get a beat on who I would be serving in the future if I decide to stay.

Another reason is these are issues that sellers, real estate agents and newer members of the community are not going to bring up to people considering moving here. No one is going to say ""you are rapidly going to struggle to get basic services and good for your kids, yourself, your pets, etc."" I turn away 5 new clients A DAY, for example.

"Alcoholic now sober here.

Urbana Liquors is the worst booze shop I've been to outside of DC.  It's bad enough their prices are easily 30% higher than nearby Franklin Liquors, they add horrible attitude and complete lack of service to the experience as well.  There used to be a longer-haired guy who was helpful and at least pleasant to deal with, no more, it's now some youngish guy who can't be bothered to say ""Hi"" when you enter even if you say ""Hi"" first, barely looks up from his phone, seems annoyed with having to ring you up and sighs and acts like it's a big deal if he has to make change for a cash purchase.  Don't bother asking if something's in stock, he'll point to the section and tell you ""look there.""  

Orion is super friendly and has a great wine selection, booze is average priced, nice store with helpful people.

Franklin is friendly enough, but you go there because the couple of minutes drive will save you some $.  

As someone who used to visit liquor stores almost every day for over a decade I wasn't going to the store to make conversations or friends, but I also shouldn't be made to feel like I'm really, really bothering the dude at Urbana Liquors, who by the way, used to never open on time and closed early often so you couldn't even depend on their posted hours.

I’m on E 2nd and have no problem finding parking in front of my apartment. I’d say most residents park on the street but the situation varies by street.

A few weeks ago they had 4 in a row and I had to constantly move my car all week.

"The few downtown properties with off street parking are often the most grand and therefore most expensive homes in the district. You’re not going to find any bargains. 

Every once in awhile a garage somewhere comes up for rent or more rarely for sale. It may or may not be convenient to walk to and it will be small, as they were designed for horse drawn carriages, not the giant vehicles of today. 

There are places directly adjacent to the downtown historical district that have garages, driveways and unmetered street parking in front of the houses. They’re often mid century smaller houses.

If you are certain you're in the right with regard to how much you owe, you can continue paying your original rent at least until the appropriate amount of time has elapsed.

"Alright, so, sorry for the long response - 

I figured the least I could do was reply, explain my situation a little more and show some appreciation for everyone's replies and support. Really means a lot. 

Unfortunately, too often, rights are for those who can afford to defend them. Originally, my lease was a six month lease, then month to month. Under the new owner, I was told it would be on a month to month basis. The due date on my rent was changed from the end of the month to the beginning of the month, and the only lease I've signed with the new owner was a copy of the original owners lease, altered to include the revised payment date. This was signed three months ago.

Legally, I'm not sure where this leaves me. If I did pursue legal action, I worry a week is not enough time to find out.

Homelessness is not an option I want to consider. I have little support in the area, and never learned how to drive (😖), so my options are extremely limited.

Realistically, I don't think I have the time or resources to seek legal counsel, nor am I sure I want to continue conducting business with my current landlord.

Once again, I appreciate the kind words and advice. I've never been through this before - so if I am wrong about seeking a lawyer, or there are resources available that would be able to resolve this quickly - please do not hesitate to send me more information.

"Baker park is one of the better dog parks Ive been to. It is more than big enough despite what one other post says. 15 dogs can all have plenty of room. It's not like you want some massive field where you lose sight of your dog anyway. And baker is usually well cared for by the city and regulars. For example it has a doggo water fountain and even in winter when the city turns off the water the regulars are great and bring cartons of water for everyone. It also depends on what your dog needs. Baker has a consistent crowd of mostly very nice people on weekdays after work and a decent crowd on weekend mornings, so it is good if your dog likes to run with others and play.",t2_8ujf2y9d,MysteriousAd4462,0,1648000718.0,0,t1_i1qs169,i1qs169,True,hallmark116,t3_tk3mba,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/tk3mba/dog_parks/,Dog parks?,/r/frederickmd/comments/tk3mba/dog_parks/i1qs169/,1,r/frederickmd,0,1

"**[Blue Lives Matter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Lives_Matter)** 
 
 >Blue Lives Matter is a countermovement in the United States advocating that those who are prosecuted and convicted of killing law enforcement officers should be sentenced under hate crime statutes. It was started in response to Black Lives Matter after the homicides of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in Brooklyn, New York on December 20, 2014. Criticized by the ACLU and others, the movement inspired a state law in Louisiana that made it a hate crime to target police officers, firefighters, and emergency medical service personnel.

"Wha? I’m not saying being Christian is racist. I’m saying associating the identities is walking a thin line. The KKK developed on the principle of protecting the White and Christian population. So there is a pattern along those lines. As for the blue lives matter, you can advocate for protecting your community and not be a counter protest that found origins as a reaction to Black Lives Matter.

"Not doubting there are little to no racist signs. But I wouldn’t put it past them to understand PR and optics. To have say “stay out of my country” or something stupid is way to obvious. However, between where they are set up and DC which I travel everyday, I see indirect representation of the expected bigotry. For example the Blue Lives Matter flag which can be argued either way but found roots as a reactionary response to BLM. Another would be the American flag being flown with the Christian flag, which someone could argue “the US was founded on Christian principles, our dollar says in god we trust” but that does not align with American values of freedom of religion. In fact I would argue the use of that flag being represented was more along the lines of claiming Christian and white Anglo-Saxon background supremacy which it is more often used to indicate like in the use of kkk.

"2022 REVIEW: I hope things turned out good for you with moving to Frederick.

I moved to Frederick from Virginia in 2009 and lived there until 2020. Overall, Frederick is a great city and it is in a great location in the state (easy access to Baltimore and DC also with nice scenery). However, I can’t help but point out the obvious issue with Frederick, and that is the fact that over the last 8-10 years, it has become completely overran by delinquents such as wannabe gangsters and a lot of teenagers who have been mentally manipulated by Hip Hop and Rap culture. There are without a doubt lots of great people in the city of Frederick, but they are quickly getting outnumbered by the bad. I moved out of state in December of 2020 for business-related reasons, but other than missing the scenery (awesome view of the mountains all throughout the county) along with the diversity of the population (very mixed community with different cultures merging together), I couldn’t have been happier to escape the toxic environment that Frederick has become due to their brainwashed youth. This applies to just about every part of Frederick.

 Ballenger Creek is probably the nicest area to live, but it is easily the mecca for young teens trying to be something they’re not (the spike in crime in the Ballenger area over the last 5 years proves that statement to be true). Urbana is easily the wealthiest area to live in and the nicest-looking area, but their youth is also severely troubled (underage sex and alcohol). Middletown is quiet and peaceful until a person of color is present, then it suddenly becomes the south in the 1950s (very racist community). Liganore/New Market is for sure the safest and most family-friendly area to live, but all of it’s residents are either farmers, pot smokers (the kids even refer to Oakdale High School as “Smoke-dale”), priveleged kids, or rude high school athletes (no in-between). Nobody ever bothers going to Myersville, Thurmont, Walkersville, or Brunswick unless they either want to buy drugs or they’ve lived there their entire lives. “40” is an area that got it’s name from the highway that runs through it. Although it has nice neighborhoods and those who live there are lucky to live so close to a lot of restaraunts and stores, it has been the city’s hotspot for the MS-13 for years now, making it one of the most dangerous areas in the county. Downtown Frederick easily offers the most activities such as great food spots, lots of bars for night life, and historic locations. But wander off in the wrong direction, away from the attractions, and you’ll just as easily find yourself in a bad neighborhood (specifically Lucas Village) that is ridden with a bunch of guys who are caught up in their 1990s Compton California fantasy. The only place in Frederick County that has pretty much no negative aspects about it, is Adamstown. Absolutely beautiful place to live, everything from the houses to the scenery is breath-taking. It even has it’s own restaraunt, post office, and convenience store at a walking distance from both The Commons and Green-Hill Manor. Once in a while, someone from the inner-city will travel through Adamstown to rob the restaraunt or the convenience store (or commit petty crime), but they are always caught and arrestted shortly after.

Overall, Frederick started off as a 4/5 rating for me when I first moved there, and once 2013-2015 came, it dropped down to a 2/5 rating. This place is all about finding the right area to reside and trying your best to keep to yourself. If you can manage to do those two things, Frederick isn’t the worst place in the world to live. I feel like the whole problem with the teens and young adults in this area really roots from the city simply not offering enough entertainment. Therefore they resort to getting intoxicated and commiting crimes for fun. I still wouldn’t recommend it over other cities/counties in Maryland.",t2_dxaebz6l,TheGloryKid,0,1647626577.0,0,t1_i16kdzx,i16kdzx,True,HokieGirl07,t3_ne3sgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/ne3sgr/moving_to_frederick/,Moving to Frederick!,/r/frederickmd/comments/ne3sgr/moving_to_frederick/i16kdzx/,1,r/frederickmd,0,1

"Yeah strange times indeed, and to be clear, I'm not knocking those that paid a markup/adjustment, because everyone's time and money value relationships are different (you can afford the markup, but not the couple days off work to fly and drive a thousand miles back).

I think you mean Level 2 charger. Lever 3 is the DCFC (DC Fast Charger) with Electrify America or ChargePoint (or the few other vendors). L3 chargers cost over $100k/unit and require commercial power hookups. But don't worry about it, electric cars come with a whole new vocabulary to learn. 

L1: 120V@8/10/12A

L2: 240V@up to 50A (the specification can go up to 80A, but few cars and stations can do this, the EV6 is 240@45A I believe. 

L3: DC fast charging, up to 800v@430A (depending on what the car can do). 


Any licensed/bonded electrician should be able to install a Level 2 charger, I personally have the Chargepoint flex since there is a deal with Potomac Energy to use that charger and connect the accounts. Depending on your home wiring capabilities and recency of construction, a regular attached garage, with decently easy panel access should cost in the $500-$1000 range, if it's a complicated install it could be a few thousand.

In terms of game shops there's Brainstorm in Walkersville for tabletop games. I think the downtown location also has table top merch but it's more of a comic shop. Video games I always recommend Cartridges Galore in Buckeystown. The staff is great and they've got a good selection in good condition. Tournament City Games is also a good pick but they're more of a card shop rather than a video game shop. My biggest pet peeve is some of their game cases have a little sun damage but those are typically on shoveware Wii games. You can find some really good deals at times on their games if you're willing to hunt more while Cartridges is more reliable for collecting.,t2_ba2ip,Jaxseven,0,1647613393.0,0,t1_i15muus,i15muus,True,Devigrrl,t3_tgt1v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/frederickmd/comments/tgt1v9/any_restaurants_seating_outside_rn_also_game_shop/,"Any restaurants seating outside RN?
