Additionally, the leftmost portion of Saranap (from Juanita Drive and over) is assigned to Lafayette schools from elementary all the way through high. 

Las Lomas High belongs to the Acalanes **Union** High School District, which consists of Miramonte (Orinda), Campolindo (Moraga), and Acalanes High (Lafayette). That's where part of the desirability comes in. LLH is not part of WCSD, which consists of elementary and middle only.

"*Adding on to ShakataGaNai's point on the southern portion of WC:* 

I-680 splits South WC into two parts, and both sides are pricey and extremely desirable. If you have to commute west towards Oakland/SF **or** south down to the Tri-Valley, I **HIGHLY** recommend finding a home in South WC. Avoiding the 680/24 junction and staying off Ygnacio Valley Rd will be a massive time saver. On the return commute from SF/Oakland, you can get off early on the Pleasant Hill Rd exit in Lafayette, and on the return commute from the Tri-Valley, you can get off early on either Livorna or Rudgear. 

Some coveted neighborhoods in South WC (in no particular order): 

* **Tice Valley:** Very bucolic feel with large lots, with most at least 0.5 acres. Has a good mix of flat lots and hillside lots so there's something for everyone, whether you want a level yard for kids to play in or amazing views of the hills. It gives off Alamo vibes, which is why I think demand for housing in Tice Valley is off the charts. 
* **Castle Hill:** It seems that, according to some records, much of Tice Valley is actually considered Castle Hill (hence the nomenclature of some streets as Castle Glen Rd, Castle Hill Ranch Rd, etc.). For example, I have a friend who lives on Castle Glen Rd, and while their realtor claimed the neighborhood as Tice Valley, their appraiser says it is technically Castle Hill. Not sure why this happens, but I do know that when people mention Castle Hill, it also includes the streets of Glen Ct, Glenhaven, Glen View, and Castle Gate among others, which, in my opinion, give off more Saranap/Parkmead vibes. 

In my own subjective perspective, Saranap/Parkmead fall more within the sphere of influence of Lafayette, while Castle Hill/Tice Valley/Rudgear fall within the sphere of influence of Alamo.

"A few of my household's favorite restaurants and regular orders:

Mixed Grain in Walnut Creek: dolsot with purple rice, kimchi stew. typically comes with really delicious ban chan (pickled appetizers)

Kokolo Donburi in WC: wagyu beef sukiyaki or mapo tofu don (FYI their tofu is different than how a Sichuan place might do it)

kibi's Cafe in WC: Bò Kho (Beef Stew)

Manakish Oven & Grill in WC: baba ganoush (less smoky than other places), veggie bowl, falafel bowl, chicken shwarma manakish

Sichuan House in WC: sizzling rice soup, mapo tofu, spicy tan tan noodles, sichuan spicy boiled fish fillet (the dish is way tastier than the English name sounds), twice cooked pork, brasied bean curd with black mushroom bok choy and carrots

Tortilleria El Molino in Concord: taco dorado, pupusas, burritos, soft tacos

I have 1 kids who goes to Walnut Acres and an older one going a small private school in Concord. WA is overall a good public school, there is an active PTA that help fund after school enrichment classes. The teachers are dedicated and caring. My gripe with the school is that the class size.

"I am an education specialist that teaches science for co-ops and specialty school programs. I've written a few recommendations to seven hills and dealt with their field trip programs along with lots of parents looking for outside science education. 

1. They require a pretty extensive letter of recommendation for your student's in class behavior. They want children who are well-behaved with good self-discipline for alone work. Progress in math and writing is secondary to behavior for entry (although you must meet the minimum)

2. Its pricey for the quality. There are other religious schools in vallejo and off of bancroft that have similar quality for less. 

3. Your vetting will be weird. School quality is lower than in-person. Although much of it is on the parents unwilling to give their students an environment for success and the teachers have no recourse for this failure... there are also teachers who are more administrative-minded who are failing to gamify education (which is absolutely required for online learning IMO). 

4. If your kid's friends are there and they feel comfy, school +tutelage will outweigh any single teacher's mastery or failings. Having your kids play with those kids at like.. an event will help you see if they fit. My usual recommendation is trunk or treat but we're pretty far out.

"Oh boy, SFO to the Pleasant Hill Bart station (thats the one across the street from Avalon WC) is a looong trip. If you’re commuting to somewhere near downtown SF, it’s about 45 mins each way. Haven’t taken that trip since before the pandemic, but it used to be super crowded during rush hour. You may want to re-think a location to live if you’re commuting all the way to SFO.

"Congrats on your Bay Area move! I relocated here four years ago and chose Walnut Creek as well. I also work in the city. I’ve since moved to Berkeley, but I enjoyed my time in WC. Here’s a quick pros and cons list of living in Walnut Creek and working in SF.

Pros:
- WC is relatively clean, quiet and safe.
- The schools are decent.
- A lot of good shopping, ok food options.
- Mount Diablo is insanely scenic. 
- Very mild winters. 


Cons:
- The commute. If you drive, crossing bay bridge alone can sometimes take 45+ minutes. You also have to pay 7 bucks every day. A lot of people choose BART (myself included), but that has its own set of downsides.  The trains will often have delays. And you likely won’t get a seat, so you’ll need to stand for about an hour. Net-net BART is the easier option, IMO. 
- Weather: I don’t mind warm weather, but WC gets hot. Like really hot. The last summer I lived in WC, there was a heat wave where temps went north of 110 degrees. 

Oh, and Avalon apartments are decent.

"Yeah Crunch is definitely way pricier. The upside is their gym is bigger and equipment is newer and generally better, you get access to their group classes, and there's a sauna (not sure if it's reopened, they closed it for covid) that you all get access to for that price.

It's up to you if you think those perks are worth the price. Personally, I preferred Fit 19's more reasonable price since I didn't need most of the extra stuff at Crunch.

"The off-market listing is definitely an attractive point! We bought last year, and we experienced the bidding wars first-hand too. Bidders were coming in way over.

"Yes, I am open to all options along 680 (Pleasanton, Dublin, San Ramon, Danville). However, bidding wars have been very off putting with every seller expecting at least 10% above asking even when the list price is at market value.

Plus Amtrak from Martinez is an option that can keep the door-door time fixed under 3 hrs and I can get 1.5 hrs of work/entertainment on the train.

"Commenting late, but this is essentially my commute and work schedule - two days a week from Northgate area to north San Jose. Ygnacio Valley Rd is about 15-20 mins depending on how far you are into WC/Northgate, but you’ll quickly learn which lanes to stay in before the freeway entrance. The morning isn’t too bad on 680S once you pass the Danville area. Then it’s a solid 30-45mins down to get to SJ. Sunol can be bad too, but you also learn to avoid the slower cars making their way up the grade. If you’re taking Montague to San Tomas, keep in mind that the lights will add commute time too. I don’t go past 1st so I can’t comment on traffic closer to SC.

It’s the commute home that is hit or miss (mostly miss). If you plan to take the same route in reverse, then you better hope to pass Sunol before 3:30-4:00PM. It gets backed up from the Livermore exit and can really slow down traffic. Even then, traffic picks up again as you get closer to 580 and then again towards WC. I’ve had 2.5 hr rides home already, and it is indeed a soul-sucking experience. Haven’t taken public transport, but I assume door to door is even longer for my commute based on where our office is and where I am in Northgate. That said, it’s a great community!

"Everybody's tolerance is different but I was personally miserable doing the WC to Sunnyvale commute for 2 years. It was exhausting, frustrating, and mentally taxing.

I avoided activities, happy hours, working out, etc. so I could just get home at a decent time. I generally couldn't get myself to do any of those things when I got home because I was too tired or had other chores and obligations. It was usually just make dinner and go to bed every single night, which personally felt like a pretty empty existence to me.

4+ hours commuting 5 days a week roughly = 20 hours per week (almost an entire day) and 43 days/1.5 months per year.

4 hours commuting + 8 (or more) hours working = 12 hours every day dedicated to the workplace. With 8 hours of sleep, getting ready for work, and making/eating meals, that only left 1-2 hours of the entire day for myself. Truly just living for the weekends.

"Walnut Creek has 4 great things going for it (excluding proximity to city):

1. The restaurant / bar scene is pretty great for a suburban town. Plenty of good options to try. 

2. It's surrounded by open space. There's pretty good mountain biking and hiking trails in Mount Diablo. 

3. Extensive Bike Trail system connecting you to surrounding towns. If you're a biker or a runner, you can take the iron horse trail to Lafayette or Contra Costa canal trail to open space in Concord / Martinez. 

4. The micro climate there is hotter than inner bay and less windy and smoggy than Central valley. 

When it comes down to it, it’s a great place if you enjoy eating out and drinking at bars at night, And mountain biking, running, or hiking during the day. However, if you live outside the downtown area it’s going to feel just the same as any other suburb. 

Look for apartments off of the iron horse Trail if you aren't in actual downtown but still want walkability.

"San Francisco - Big City, you know what that's like.

Lafayette - Quiet, high end suburb. There isn't much going on here. Nice place to live, but quiet.

Walnut Creek - Biggest little city in the far East Bay ( as uposed to Berkeley/Oakland type area). Biggest night life scene of the TriValley, more apartments, younger crowd. Still 'Burbs though - so lots of families and what not.

Alameda - It's an interesting one, I don't know it as well, but I do know a number of younger folks that live(d) there. The biggest complaints I've heard is that there isn't much space on the island, there isn't a ton of stuff there... so you're often leaving via one of the very few roads to the ""mainland""... directly into Oakland.

&#x200B;

Overall, if you're near a BART station you have the advantage of being able to get to SF/Oakland/Berkeley with relative ease for an evening out - if you're only looking for that occasionally. Clearly doing the BART thing every Friday night wouldn't be nearly as cool...also it turns into a pumpkin at midnight.

If you want an area that has a potential at a younger crowd, then Walnut Creek is probably the best bet in the TriValley area. But you're still in the 'Burbs so don't be surprised when a lot of the people in the night life are 30s+",t2_6i3o1,ShakataGaNai,0,1638383922.0,0,t1_hmtstl6,hmtstl6,True,[deleted],t3_r6imz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/walnutcreek/comments/r6imz2/late_20s_moving_to_walnut_creek_better_option/,Late 20s moving to Walnut Creek.

"What are you looking for? 
Night life? Quiet? Hiking? Starting a family? Do you like to drive to most places (as opposed to bike/public transit)?

The 4 places you listed have a lot of differences. 

Off the top of my head, I would put San Francisco on one side and Lafayette on the other. 

San Francisco has a lot going on, variety of businesses and activities, but could be stressful and even claustrophobic if you like open space and quiet and driving without traffic. Most similar to LA proper, out of the places you listed.
You would also have to drive over the Bay Bridge to get to/from Oakland (significant time + money). 

Lafayette is in many ways the opposite. Relatively few/small (but nice) shopping and restaurant areas. Quiet, easy to drive around. A lot of the homes are tucked into the hills, but there are several condo complexes along the main street (and more coming).  

Alameda is just next door to Oakland, but has more of a ""small town"" feel, relatively speaking.  Relatively quiet but with a fair amount of good restaurants. Great for strolling along the beach or kitesurfing. Sometimes it can feel like a hassle to go off the island (but again, Oakland is right next door; also quick access to Oakland Airport). 

Walnut Creek feels most like a typical suburb, but also has a very bustling downtown with busy restaurants, bars, and shopping centers.

"The IMT apartments are right across from the Bart station in northern WC. They are technicaly in pleasant hill (but its a finger of PH into WC). 

They let you have 2 kitties and rent I believe starts at 1800 for a studio and just over 2k for a 1 bedroom. 

The maintenance has improved since they have new management, mainly due to a better ticketing system to request maintenance. The maintenance people are very nice. The front desk ladies are mostly great, if a little disorganized. 

The apartments are quiet: mainly young professionals and elderly retired folk. The middle is a giant dog park. There is tons of shade (so get ready to sweep your patio). The walls are reasonably think and sound proof for a wooden structure. But most people are quiet and know their immediate neighbors. 

There are some fresh transplants that don't know things like don't change your babies diaper in the laundry rooms or leash your dog. But if you're neighborly and polite about it they learn fine. Just be patient with people, its scary moving to a new country.

"How many people?

The Heather Farms rose garden is very nice and would make for nice wedding pictures, but I think Heather farms is too crowded a place to get married.  Lots of people and also other events are often blasting music.

I'd suggest Castle Rock's recreational area, which is also beautiful but has a lot less people.  I know you can reserve areas, or if you live dangerously you can just grab an area because it's never that many people.

"Pleasant Hill's elementary school ratings are similar to Valle Verde's in the Woodlands but they tend to score lower on test scores and academic progress.  Valle Verde's rating is taking a huge hit on equity because they're not great at serving families with special needs such as families where English is not the language spoken at home.  While that can't be ignored, if your child(ren) don't have special needs and English is the primary language used at home, the education at Valle Verde will be great.  MDUSD also allows interdistrict transfers if a parent makes a request, and I don't think it's terribly difficult.  I know of a parent who just didn't get along with office staff at a different school so he had his kid transferred.  

Sidewalks, family friendly and great schools are all here.  There are only handful of streets that go in and out of this neighborhood so there is very little traffic in general.  If you change jobs and end up taking bart, the free Contra Costa Bart bus will pick up people at Peachwillow/Oak Grove and take them to Pleasant Hill Bart.  My SO used to drop our kids off at the daycare on the corner of this intersection and hop on the bus to bart into the city.  Not gonna lie, car commute down Ygnacio during rush hour is terrible.  Take the bus and Bart if it works for you.

"Pleasant Hill schools are rated at just about the same as Woodlands.  College Park is an 8/10, Northgate is a 9/10.  Valley Verde is a 7/10 elementary and so are some Pleasant Hill elementaries.

Pleasant Hill has some areas which are less designed and may be missing sidewalks.  But it's much more convenient to freeways, which is also nice for kids.  If you save 20 minutes of driving you're more like to make a trip to the zoo or whatever.

Pleasant Hill is totally safe...but it does have a homeless population and some nonviolent crime.  There's smashed car windows.  There's homeless people who hang out at the Pleasant Hill playground, near the slides.

"My Mexican recommendations (copy/pasted from an old thread)

***Sol y Luna*** is my go-to for birria these days. ***Tacos El Patron*** needs to be in the discussion too, but it's a little further away. 

***Tacos WC*** is pricy but gets the job done in a pinch and it's probably the best offering close to Downtown Walnut Creek. 

I'm smitten with the breakfast burrito at ***Dulces Antojitos*** over in the Shadelands by ARF. 

Any taqueria over on Monument in Concord isprobably going to be better than what you can find in Walnut Creek. ***El Faro*** in particular is a fav of mine.

If you're looking for a sit down meal w chips and salsa and margaritas, I'd recommend ***La Piñata*** just outside Concord's Todos Santos Plaza.

"One large problem we had with MDUSD and being in Walnut Creek was that MDUSD was one of the last districts in the nation to open up last school year.  In fact,  it never fully did so until the new school year. 

Part of the problem was that, even though Walnut Creek and Clayton didn't have a lot of community spread of COVID at the time,  other cities in the district did.  The school board took an ""everybody or nobody"" approach and kept all of the schools fully remote because of equity/fairness, and the optics, of keeping schools in poorer cities closed. I understood the sentiment,  but it was very frustrating,  especially since the teachers union was ready to open where they was little community spread. 

Valle Verde is great.  The schools feeding up to Northgate are pretty much all good for california.

"Tacos Walnut Creek is delicious and centrally located in WC, however it's a bit expensive and their service is consistently rude, like its actually weird. More upscale-ish/ trendy(?) but still does takeout

If you're closer to WC/PH border they just (finally) reopened Taqueria La Plaza in Palos Verdes Mall. It gets the job done in a pinch but is not my #1 favorite. Very sweet people too.

Mariachi Mexican Grill is more of a cost efficient choice and very good. More of the strip mall vibe but one of our favorites. Also very sweet people

"Story time, hopefully something uplifting to convince you life isn't over - I was in your exact situation in 1991, moved to the US with a nice American girl, living in San Francisco and although we loved each other, after a few years it was obvious that we were growing in different directions and decided to split.  I stayed in a shitty hotel for a few weeks while looking for a place, moved in with roommates in the Haight, things seemed pretty bleak.  Roommates turned out to be awesome, I made a lot of friends, had a lot of fun in my late twenties to make up for lost time.  Met my girlfriend/wife and now have two awesome kids and a great life in Walnut Creek.  Coming up on 25 year anniversary.

I’m a cook in downtown in Walnut Creek and I’ve been cooking in the area for the past two years so I like to think that I’ve got some knowledge of the food culture/climate of the area. I’d suggest doing a pop up somewhere local as an example of what your catering service would be like. The lucky thing about charcuterie is that it doesn’t require any cooking in the time of service so you could in theory do the pop up outside which could be nice. Although Walnut Creek is a rich area they aren’t like the wealthy in Piedmont or San Francisco they seem to be rather reserved as to what they’re willing to experience so keep that in mind when designing the menu. All in all I think that it has potential once everything settles down so many people lost their restaurants you might have come at a time where your service is needed,t2_3lx9stxf,Gingerfox666,0,1629349727.0,0,t1_h9hyhyv,h9hyhyv,True,[deleted],t3_p2todk,https://www.reddit.com/r/walnutcreek/comments/p2todk/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/walnutcreek/comments/p2todk/deleted_by_user/h9hyhyv/,2,r/walnutcreek,0,2

"I’m pretty picky about my produce, too and generally find Safeway’s to be sub par as well. 

In no particular order I like Concord Produce Market, 99 Ranch, Seafood City, and Sprouts. 

The farmers markets are nice, but they’ve raised their prices dramatically in the last couple of years and I find the price/benefit trade off isn’t worth it to me anymore (especially since you have to get up so early... 😅 I’m not a morning person). 

The quality of the produce at Whole Foods is generally good, but the prices can sometimes not be great. If I only have a few things I need and I happen to be near it, I’ll pop in, but for day to day produce, again, I don’t think it’s worth it. 

I’ve also been using Imperfect Foods off and on the last few months and have been mostly happy with them. I’ve had some problems with crushed or off produce, but their support team is typically really great about refunding when necessary and their prices are pretty good.

"Stayed there for a year during the pandemic in one of their remodeled two bedrooms. It was nice enough. Not great, not terrible. Neighbors were all pretty quiet. It’s also close to the bart, which is nice. Couple of cons I noticed: 1) the in unit washer / dryer combos are not very great. Ours shook quite a bit on the spin cycle. 2) the maintenance staff were unresponsive to a request for a new sliding screen door which was obviously damaged due to normal wear and tear. They said they’d replace it but then never followed up. 3) I felt the move out fees were artificially high. For example, we thoroughly cleaned our apartment when we moved out but we still ended up being charged for like three hours of professional cleaning.

"The killing of Latasha Harlins was not justified but security footage did not show she left money on the counter and showed she hit  Soon Ja Du. Doesn’t justify a murder, but a gross overreaction is not evidence of racism. Also telling that you have to reach back 30 decades to find an example of Asian on black violence. 

Ten Koreans were murdered by black men in unprovoked attacks the same year. Most were not arrested or got lenient sentences. OJ was acquitted for murdering a Jewish man and a white woman around that time. Guess what? Asians and Jews didn’t riot and attack random black people for the crimes of other black people. 

Over 25 Asian Americans have been murdered by black people, many in blatant racist attacks, since the start of 2020. Many have gotten super lenient sentences or none at all. Would it be justified for Asians to riot and burn down black businesses and attack random innocent black people in retaliation? No, that is white supremacist logic. The LA riots was an anti-Asian pogrom based on racist logic. The black on Asian violence over the past few years are almost entirely one sided.

"Claiming that racism only flows one way or is “one-sided” is really disingenuous. For example, the LA riots took an ugly turn when 15-yr old Latasha Harlins was shot in the back by the Korean shopkeeper, Soon Ja Du, because the shopkeeper believed that Latasha stole a pint of milk. Latasha did not steal and security footage showed she left money and the pint of milk on the counter, but she was still killed. The shopkeeper was later given a very lenient sentence because the judge (who was later kicked off the bench) essentially blamed Latasha for her death. 

Racism exists everywhere, whether or not people want to admit it. Trying to say that it’s one-sided is neither true nor logical.
