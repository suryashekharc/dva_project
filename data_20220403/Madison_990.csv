"> Anyhow, burden of proof is on you to support your bullshit points.  You can't support them, so they're probably not true.  

Since I was basing my opinion on things *heard*, rather than recent data I can cite, I decided to look closer at it. [It turns out I was actually (most likely) wrong](https://belonging.berkeley.edu/most-least-segregated-cities) about Madison being one of the most segregated cities. I would note, however, that the incomplete dataset from that source makes it harder to say definitively, since it only considers cities with populations over 200k. Therefore, there are at least 25 cities in the Midwest that don't make the cut (more than half of those listed [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Midwestern_cities_by_size)). 

I also didn't read too deeply into the metrics by which they measured ""segregation,"" so there might be wrinkles not considered, such as ghettoization. One common example of this is people of color being systemically sequestered to areas with lower average income (a consequence of redlining decades ago); which means less income tax funding their school; which means less resources to hire the best teachers or pay for the best equipment, the best facilities, extracurriculars, and other programs; which means less opportunity and likelihood for students in those families to succeed; which means less money being recirculated into those communities; rinse and repeat. Anecdotally I suspect Madison wouldn't do too well by that measurement since our Black population is still highly concentrated in a few specific areas, which are known to be shittier parts of town.

Still, I'd say that single source is enough to admit my claim was probably incorrect, or at least that I need more information before I can make it in good faith.

There. See how valuable it is to actually look at and trust data? See how easy it is to admit when you're wrong? 

> Madison is the least segregated city in the Midwest.  If you disagree, prove it's not.  See how that works?  

For someone who just tried to explain burden of proof to me, it's pretty funny you immediately got it wrong lol. You're right that the burden of proof lies with the person making the claim. That means in your example, the burden of proof lies with the person claiming that ""Madison is the least segregated city in the Midwest,"" not with the person rejecting that claim.

The ironic thing is, based on that source I cited above, you might actually be right and might even be able to prove it if you were willing to learn something for yourself. 

> As far as comparing Madison to smaller, overwhelmingly white cities, you did that in your initial comment.  

No...I didn't. I made no mention of Waukesha or any other cities that don't meet the bar of statistical relevance. (Again, that's not something I'm inventing for the sake of argument, it's just basic statistics.) You can't meaningfully measure racial segregation in an area that is overwhelmingly populated by people of one race. Asking me to prove that to you is like asking me to prove that 2+2=4. It is what it is.

Anyway, I guess I have more reading to do. The most valuable outcome of debate is the opportunity to correct oneself. It can only help me adjust my positions to be more defensible in the future, so thanks for that.",t2_85413,thevoiceofzeke,0,1649004229.0,0,t1_i38ot5v,i38ot5v,False,Independent_Corgi316,t3_tkgz1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tkgz1a/blaska_and_muldrow_spar_at_school_board_forum/,Blaska and Muldrow spar at school board forum - Isthmus,/r/madisonwi/comments/tkgz1a/blaska_and_muldrow_spar_at_school_board_forum/i38ot5v/,1,r/madisonwi,0,1

"As someone who grew up in Waunakee, here are pros and cons:

Pros:

* From what I've heard of the Madison school district, Waunakee is slightly better with advanced coursework support for students, especially at the high school level.
* If your kid does sports they will be adored and you'll probably get some clout if they're good enough.

Cons:

* There's jack shit to do in Waunakee. Like seriously - I think when my siblings and I were growing up, the only activity we actually did that was in-town was stuff like girl/boy scouts; everything else we would drive in to Madison for. I think most people in town either do something similar, or they're rich enough they just buy a ton of stuff to entertain their kids.
* Schools are crowded - I know they're crowded everywhere, but at least a few years ago they had trailers out back at one of the elementary schools to serve as mobile classrooms because there were just too many people. There's 3 elementary schools, and all those kids are gonna grow up and go to the same middle + high school, which were already kind of crowded.
* If your kid doesn't do sports, good luck finding anything to do. Also if you don't like kids and parents making children's sports their entire personality, do not move here, that is all people do. Even in the schools - one semester I just straight up didn't have a teacher for one of my classes bc he was also the football coach and he never turned up to class bc he was too busy planning/coaching.
* Diversity here is non-existent. I could count the number of non-white kids in my grade on one hand out of 300+ students. Relatedly, there's been a lot of people commenting in the paper how they ""hate CRT"" and how they need to stop the schools from ""ruining our children"", which gives you an idea of the vibe. It's not all bad, like, back in 2020 they had a BLM chalkboard outside the old library, but that was right down the street from the house that has 500 billion American flags and thin blue line signs up all the time. EDIT: there's another comment on this post that's going like ""is it racist to live in a place that holds your family's culture"" and honestly that's about the average vibe you'll get in Waunakee.
* Expensive as shit. Google tells me average home price in Madison is $350k, while in Waunakee it's $465k, and that's accurate. Most of the growth and building is in expensive McMansion neighborhoods, and there's never really any small, inexpensive housing up for sale.

TLDR: if you want your kids to have access to slightly better educational opportunities in a public school, and they like sports, go ahead and move to Waunakee.

"We are in a similar position, looking for a larger home for our growing family. Diversity is a huge factor. Although I'm sure it's changing, people around here genuinely do not understand why diversity is an important thing for children to be exposed to. It's not just a buzzword, it will affect how children grow up and see/interact with the world. 

Then there is the white flight factor. Sure, not all white flight is racist, but I still can't get past it. We are going to try our best to stay in Madison (Eastside). School wise it means that we need to be more involved in our children's education, as the schools might not be as good as those in Waunakee, Verona etc. But that makes us reassess our priorities, ie. Not working as much to spend more time with the kids.

">Fucking balloon releases need to be banned.  It's not bringing anyone back, just polluting and killing animals. What an homage/s

The level of inhumanity that some of you have is sometimes just . . . disturbing.   My only confusion is whether it's intentional, unintentional, or somewhere in the middle.  In either case,  it is not clear why every time a person of color dies, and if they release balloons there is some snide, backhanded comment about it that is bereft of any sympathy for the family or their loved ones.  This should not be the time to virtue signal about the environment.  You even had some posters on this thread perform [CCAP searches on the victim](https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tuhlk8/comment/i33x85d/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and [scour the internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tuhlk8/comment/i344cq1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to see whether the *victim* had any criminal records in *Illinois*.  Who cares and who does that? It implies that if you're murdered in cold blood and you have a criminal record, it was either your fault or you were somehow culpable.  This was a man who was shot and killed outside a government building and the family isn't attempting to pay a ""homage"" they attempting to *grieve* the best way they can.   JC, please, give them just a bit of grace during this time.

Because many of you have conscientiously self-segregated to exclusive Madison neighborhoods or have completely self-segregated entirely to Middleton, Verona, Sun Prairie, or Cross Plains, you may not be aware of how it is to be poor (much less a person of color who is experiencing poverty).  But, I am here to tell you that when you're dealing with high fuel prices, high rent, high utilities, unreliable transportation, personal and social trauma, or ongoing family issues on top of living check-to-check for meager wages, the environment is not on most people's radar.  It can't be because poverty is the real-life enactment of failing to attain Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

I understand your frustration to *some* degree but strongly believe that heaping this frustration upon this grieving family is misplaced.  These balloon releases while not a wise or environmentally friendly thing to do, it isn't responsible for loosened phosphorous restrictions that contribute to the ongoing pollution (and algal blooms) of our lakes and streams.   The balloons did not do that our lakes.  The balloon releases are not responsible for well 15  - a well that produced well over 1000 GPM of freshwater being contaminated with PFAS and being shut down.   The balloons did not do this. Over the last 20 years, the balloon releases have not loosened restrictions on mining and wetland restrictions nor has it strangled the DNR's budget to the point where they cannot provide maintenance, repair, and upgrades to existing outdoor spaces.  The balloons had no part in that, either.  The balloons releases are not responsible for the Department of Health limiting consumption of fish from Madison's lakes due to contamination of mercury, PCPs, and PFAS.  The balloons did not take part in that press release.   The balloons are not involved in the ongoing contamination of salt in aquafers that make up our drinking supply.  The balloon releases did not do this. The balloons did not vote 6 - 1 to weaken standards PFAS in drinking water from 20 PPT to 70 PPT.   The balloons decided not to get involved in that decision. You say that the balloon releases are killing animals, yes, that might be true. But, the balloons did not approve of the wholesale slaughter of 1/3 of Wisconsin's wolf population.  The balloons abstained from that decision as well.   While I do support banning balloon releases and having such releases being punished, I also think if you care about the environment, your frustration and anger toward this family is terribly misplaced.

"You are getting carried away with nitpicking, and I hate to tell you this while you are in the midst of clutching your pearls, but the City provided the cost basis for things like the cost per mile for bike paths and the shelter (part of the cost of which will be subsidized by the water pump installation since that has to happen anyway). And we used playground equipment catalogs for the equipment and cost basis. Except the toddler fort. That was built at another park though. And many parks have ziplines?  City staff themselves have expressed concerns about the long term maintenance costs of the prairies and planting beds so that's where that comes from. 

It's meant to inspire. We don't expect everything to come out exactly as shown. Paying out of personal funds for each revision meant that if something looks like concrete but is meant to be playground pad but has to be a different color to differentiate from grass then so be it. The City was supposed to take this concept and turn it around. Instead the mayor chose to form a large ad hoc planning committee overrepresented by insiders, adjacent neighborhoods with their own parks and very different demographics, and representatives of MUFA.

"So here are just a few of the litany of issues:

You can’t make a playground with a concrete pad. Not an approved surface. Also the city of Madison is not approving new playground structures for construction at this time to replace old ones. If it is to be removed, there will be no replacement. Source: have done a lot of work with the city of city parks department with licensed designers, this has been an ongoing hang up with the Vilas Park design. Also, the “fort” is too high up to be allowed for a playground. There are vertical limits on what can be included due to falls. Not your fault, again, had you hired someone licensed they wouldn’t have made this simple mistake. There is a list of approved structures, making your own is rarely ever a liability that a city or engineer is willing to take on. 

On the liability topic: a zip line? Really? Whose brilliant idea is that? Literally will never be approved. 

Funding. This is a massive issue. The structures have exotic designs (lots of glass, cantelevered supports etc.). My estimate for the price for those alone would be about $20-30 million. Notwithstanding the amount of pavement, with that being ~$2-3 million per mile. 

Your “key views” make absolutely no sense. Largely because your designer didn’t model the topography of the location. 

Drainage. This is another huge one and currently cannot be modeled due again to lack of consideration. 

Also, the statements you are making about planting and managing prairies are completely false. Source; have a BS and MA in Geography with focuses in biogeography, done a lot of work with prairies. Also have done work with licensed Landscape Architects on native prairie restorations. I can say with 100% confidence that your statements are patently false. 

The “traffic pinch points”… most of these do not conform to traffic codes of either Madison or WI. Again, something that will need to be totally reworked by engineers. 

The “open design structure” makes literally no structural or architectural sense. Again, they are going to ask you to come back with stamped designs from a licensed architect. 

TLDR; in the state of WI, these types of plans are required by law to be created and stamped by licensed architects, engineers, and/or landscape architects. This is not an option. 

The city knows this, as well as how much doing that costs (for something like this, probably around $100k just for the design). 

The reason they don’t want this shared is because your design is totally unfeasible in its current form. You doing what you are right now in trying to whip up support only goes wrong because people don’t understand that the city has very good reasons for refusing such a poorly defined proposal. Unless you are willing to shell out 6-7 figures more for the whole licensed design, this is getting nowhere.",t2_3oilz9lp,the_Q_spice,0,1648994164.0,0,t1_i381xyk,i381xyk,False,stinthe608,t3_tun2g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tun2g3/fitchburg_stoner_prairie_park_concept_i/,"Fitchburg: Stoner Prairie Park concept.

"Hmmm….This concept shows what amenities the neighborhood desired in terms of equipment (youth fitness course, secondary shade structure) and features. And the layout itself in terms of what goes where (toddler park, new playground, shelter) was proposed up by Parks itself so this followed that. For the toddler park, an existing toddler park exists in that location and we have proposed some additional equipment and a toddler track. As I’ve stated elsewhere the shelter location is also predetermined due to new pump station. The shelter shown here is actually a copy of the latest shelter the City put in at another park (I found the blueprints) but with a different aesthetic facade. It’s all to scale. Site conditions are basically flat. 

In any case, we invite licensed professionals to get involved. This like any other concept is just that a concept. But people like to be shown something and so I want this shown — especially since we were told to present a concept.

"I don't have any advice regarding specific Taekwondo schools... but just generally:

I'm assuming you're referring to the Korean Taekwondo and not the bullshit that some places (in the US) call ""Taekwondo"" but in fact is rather Karate or some random shit that the school made up or something. There are two ""styles"" of Taekwondo. WT(F) and ITF. There is a third, ATA ([American Taekwondo Association](https://taekwondo.fandom.com/wiki/ATA_Taekwondo)), but I am not familiar with that at all.

^(why do I say WT(F\)? They were WTF -- World Taekwondo Federation -- but then someone noticed the acronym and changed it to WT.)

To my knowledge, there is no dojang (school) in Madison that is registered with the Kukkiwon (the ""governing body"" of WT-taekwondo, based in Korea) ([source](https://kms.kukkiwon.or.kr/usr/club/find.do?level=3&contCd=005&nationCd=101&divisionCd=050&engNm=Wisconsin&subCnt=0&lat=44.7973101&lng=-91.49765359999998&zoom=8&page=1&orderBy=&rowsPerPage=10&pagesPerIndex=10&continentList=005&nationList=101) -- the Avila TKD appears to have an address of an apartment...???). (Please let me know if there is one... I want to know.)

So depending on what you're looking for you may be out of luck. Are you looking for a WT school? An ITF? Anything?

I am a UW student, and I do Taekwondo with a friend that I know from Korea at my/his apartment (quietly... unfortunately -- can't scream, can't have the fun of breaking boards, don't want to be annoying, or worse, be evicted) (both of us are 4th dan black belts). Unfortunately I don't think you can join us, but... if you want WT-taekwondo, doing it at home _might_ be your only option unless you want to drive a fair distance. (For a very specific reason which I will not go into, the UW Taekwondo club doesn't work for us two, so this is the next best alternative.)",t2_i6chcted,Distinct_Village_87,0,1648937165.0,0,t1_i35nvsd,i35nvsd,True,slipperyspud,t3_tur3jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tur3jq/where_can_an_adult_learn_taekwondo_in_madison/,Where can an adult learn taekwondo in Madison?,/r/madisonwi/comments/tur3jq/where_can_an_adult_learn_taekwondo_in_madison/i35nvsd/,3,r/madisonwi,0,3

"That is exactly what you sign up for when you move into new construction. Anyting built after like 1960 is generally shoddy construction done quickly and on the cheap, with very little regard for how long it's going to last or what it's going to be like for people to live there. And it's only gotten worse in the decades since.

Next time you move try to find an older building that has been renovated a little bit but not too much, I think you'll be very surprised and pleased with how much better it is overall.

"Honestly the Madison one is exactly the same as all the Trader Joe's I've been to in Chicago and Seattle. Even down to the tiny parking lot where you cannot maneuver if someone's coming out of a parking space -- Trader Joe's lots are so famous for being too small that I think they do it on purpose at this point. 

 The only TJ's I'd class as ""better"" is in suburban Maryland, and it's basically only better because it's part of a strip mall so their parking lot can not be too tiny, and the store moved into a space that's larger than usual for Trader Joe's so there's more room in the aisles.

So the law in CA currently mandates that stores sell these bags for a minimum of ten cents, when the bags are proven to cost only 4-5 cents to the store. The stores are profiting off of selling the bags. Because fuck poor people to whom those extra cents would actually mean another helping of rice or another can of soup. Classic case of a California initiative with good intentions getting twisted and mangled into a weird pseudo-progressive thing that actually harms certain groups of people.",t2_hkaql,usedtomakemelaugh,0,1648876115.0,0,t1_i32qnbp,i32qnbp,False,Frequent_Comment_199,t3_tu46qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/tu46qy/why_does_wi_have_a_law_that_prohibits/,Why does WI have a law that prohibits municipality from banning plastic bags?,/r/madisonwi/comments/tu46qy/why_does_wi_have_a_law_that_prohibits/i32qnbp/,5,r/madisonwi,0,5

"My Madison/Dane County transportation dream:

1. Add a north beltline to complete the loop.
1. Add a light rail line/subway that goes straight through the isthmus, and kill the awful stroads that are East Washington Avenue and University Avenue (via the rail line, trams/street cars, protected bike lanes, etc). Make the westbound bike lane on University actually protected like the eastbound bike lane is.
1. Build more off-road bike paths with grade-separated road crossings.
1. Blow up the existing Blair/John Nolen/Wilson/Willy Street/Bike Path/Train hairball and grade-separate as much of it as possible.
1. Leave the existing beltline alone (maybe reduce the number of exits or somehow fix the mass of rapid exits between Monona Drive and Verona Road).
1. Finally connect the Cap City Trail to the Glacial Drumlin Trail in Cottage Grove.
1. Build better bike connections to Sun Prairie.
1. Reduce the amount of parking at the malls, add green space/parks and better bike infrastructure.
1. Completely grade-separate the US-51 intersections with Buckeye, Pflaum, and East Washington Avenue.",t2_b4i4bojb,dcchambers,0,1648866677.0,0,t1_i32ango,i32ango,True,enjoying-retirement,t3_ttvdq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/madisonwi/comments/ttvdq0/the_dot_wants_your_input_on_longterm_plans_for/,The DOT wants your input on long-term plans for the Beltline corridor,/r/madisonwi/comments/ttvdq0/the_dot_wants_your_input_on_longterm_plans_for/i32ango/,10,r/madisonwi,0,10

Much much better than a lawn. The addition of clover which has above ground roots called stolons acts as a webbing and increases wear tolerance. Athletic fields are starting to use micro clover in soccer and football fields for this reason plus it constantly provides nitrogen for the grass and reduces the need to water.

"Hi there - we organize a 5k run/walk/jog event called parkrun that happens every Saturday morning at 9am. We meet near the Memorial Union. Right now, we are meeting just inside the building across from the Helen C White Library. This is in the lobby of the Wisconsin Union Theater.  It is very low-key and community-oriented. It is part of the network of global parkrun events. It is only as competitive as you want it to be and anyone is welcome to join.  It is also entirely driven by volunteers. One volunteer job is to be the tail walker -- this means no one can finish behind the tail walker! 

Here are some links to more information:

"for sure, had a chance to go through this program called the yahara water shed academy a few years ago and learned a lot. Mostly learned how complicated everything is, and yet we can still make a difference if we educate and act. keeping streets clean of leaves in the fall, rain barrels/gardens/good water management (appropriate downspout use etc.), making sure your water softener is running correctly and not using excess salt (salinity in the lakes are a whole other thing!), and not using ""flushable wipes"" (the things that say they flush, but actually cause a lot of clogs which cost a lot of money) are the main things average people can do to help. 

The majority of the runoff is from farms, but it's not like farmers are maliciously poisoning our water. It's costly to store manure and only use it when it should be used, it's costly to manage land sustainably, and most consumers aren't willing to pay the real cost of farming. There's an org yahara pride farms that seems like it does a good job representing the farming point of view, but i haven't heard much from them lately.

There are side roads you should become familiar with in order to skip around accident areas.  Knowing those routes beforehand can shave some time off and help you make quick decisions.



Outside of regular rush hour times, driving across town would take like 25-30 minutes between those two points.  So really, not that bad overall for true delays.  I am much happier now living on the west side with my 15 minute commute though!
