Payne phalen is good because of both Payne avenue which is starting to go through a bit of revitalization, and arcade, which has lots of things.

Daytons bluff has a lot of the historical homes, that aren't as fancy or expensive as the ones in summit. Think blue collar rich vs white collar rich.

"Totally agree with the 24 hour coverage, and you are not wrong on other points, just want to clarify. 

They opened the day shelter during the winter of the pandemic to space people out. Though, it didn‚Äôt help that we also saw an increase in the number of unhoused individuals during that same time. They originally expected it to serve a small number of people, but it ended up having like 400% more people than they had planned (I can‚Äôt remember the exact number, sorry).

Secondly, it wasn‚Äôt entirely unused. They were training EMTs there, which was also helping people in underserved communities get that training. The city ‚Äúmoved‚Äù that program. Officially, when we were asked, we were told ‚Äúthat was moved to this other station‚Äù but that turned out not to be exactly true. They stopped doing it here, but never restarted it at the new location.

Fortunately, if it makes you feel better or puts you at ease, there are two facilities blocks away that also serve the same population. This was originally only put in place due to the pandemic to get people spaced out further. 

I think for this to have been more successful, there should have been MORE services that actually solve the problems and not just a band aid for the symptoms. It was like giving cough medicine to someone with TB. Since they only operated from 8-8, they basically just turned people loose on the neighborhood and let the police deal with it.

There already is a 24 hour shelter at Day; there's just more need than Day can serve (even remodeled and enlarged) so Freedom House was opened to ease the crunch.

And I agree they never really got a handle on client behavior. After opening they had to hire the ""ambassadors"" who cleaned up the messes, directed clients away from businesses and toward bathroom facilities, etc. To open a day shelter without thinking that might be needed from the get go was optimistic.

Speaking specifically about the unhoused people, the shelter was only open from 8am to 8pm. Also, they didn‚Äôt seem to have the same sobriety requirements that Catholic Charities and Salvation Army seemed to have.

So each night, at 8pm, they just shut the doors and turned everyone out into the surrounding neighborhood. After that time the only resource to deal with any outcomes were the Saint Paul police, who would have to deal with whatever mental or dependency issues that were occurring.

Contrary to what the article states, **there is no need to call the city about this.** Sign up for updates here: https://www.stpaul.gov/departments/saint-paul-regional-water-services

- there is no first-come first-served policy.  
- There is nothing to sign up for.
- The city will be rolling this out street by street
- they will make contact when it is your turn.  
- 1 inch copper will replace your lead service


priority will be by street needing repair. If you live on a newer street, you are likely to wait longer for new service line than someone on a street needing repaving.  This is because they will need to rip up your street, to get at your connection, and it makes sense to do this for an entire street for efficiency.

"You're right, most developers don't pursue projects that are 100% affordable, but almost all are willing to build some affordable units if they can increase the rent on other units (see: Minneapolis.) This amendment restricts the ability of developers to cap some of their unitsand still make the returns that their financiers expect.

Further, *high-income units reduce the price of all units*. It's called the filtering effect. Each high-rent unit you build increases the supply of high-rent units, which in turn reduces the price of high-rent units in real terms. This allows a middle-income family to move into a now-cheaper high-rent unit and frees up a middle-income unit. The increased supply of middle-income units reduces the price of middle-income units, which in turn makes it possible for a low-income household to move into a middle-income unit. This frees up a low-income unit, increasing the supply of low-income units, and reducing their price in turn.

It's a complicated effect, but the net result is that one new high-income unit actually ""adds"" a low-income unit. Thus, you want developers to build *no matter what income* they expect will fill the units. This rent control amendment, by restricting all rents, is actually going to hurt low-income people as well as high-income people.",t2_3tn6uqi5,jcmcgough,0,1647887656.0,0,t1_i1k973w,i1k973w,False,dmau9600,t3_tgbbuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/,"Minnesota Senate committee votes to cancel rent control ordinances in Minneapolis, St. Paul",/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/i1k973w/,1,r/saintpaul,0,1
"Yeah but here's the thing: If the value of an investment is capped below market value *developers just won't make the investment*.

Let's say you have five dollars. You can invest it in a low-return market (St. Paul) and make six dollars, or invest it in a higher return market nearby (say, Falcon Heights) and make ten dollars. You want to make ten dollars more than you want to make six, so you'll invest your money in Falcon Heights. *You won't make the investment in St. Paul*. 

Limited capital + seeking highest returns possible = avoiding low-return investments.

And let's be clear: this isn't just a ""wah wah"" for developers. This will materially harm metro residents by raising rents over time.

Your wage doesn't grow enough every year, and that's a problem, but it's a separate problem. The solution to stagnant wages is not to cap the price of everything a low-wage person might want to buy, but to raise your wage.

Could they not find a buyer and sell the company?

Maybe they've tried all this and more, obviously I wouldn't know. I'm not an expert on any of this but it just makes me curious about how one comes to this decision.

"**[Wheatstone bridge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatstone_bridge)** 
 
 >A Wheatstone bridge is an electrical circuit used to measure an unknown electrical resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit, one leg of which includes the unknown component. The primary benefit of the circuit is its ability to provide extremely accurate measurements (in contrast with something like a simple voltage divider). Its operation is similar to the original potentiometer. The Wheatstone bridge was invented by Samuel Hunter Christie (sometimes spelled ""Christy"") in 1833 and improved and popularized by Sir Charles Wheatstone in 1843.

And it's honestly, because they are uncomfortable dealing with the fact that this is a major problem, and they've been taught to simply sweep issues like this under the rug, because again, of the non-confrontational nature of the state.

There is a major problem with dealing with outsiders in the state, or people who are perceived to be outsiders, and instead of talking about it, we're finding solutions with, people get upset with you for bringing it up.   It's like we didn't learn about the lessons from 2 years ago.

Oh I agree. Do I think rent control is a great solution? Thats a different discussion.

"I think 3% is reasonable for old construction, but most will agree that 3% is way, *way* too low for new construction.

Landlords, as economic actors, are theoretically willing to engage in any endeavor that makes a profit, and 3% per year is generally plenty to do that. The problem is that landlords are, in reality, not actually willing to ""provide housing"" (i.e., rent out properties they own rather than sell them) for 3% a year because they can get easily get twice or three times as much in unregulated communities. It's not about whether or not landlords *should* make more than 3%, it's about whether or not they're *willing* to work for that, and most are not. Landlords can make money at 3%, but most won't bother.

The same problem extends to financiers and developers. The value of a new apartment complex is the total expected value of the rents it will accrue *ad infinitum*. Subtracting inflation from the rent cap, that means that most developments in Saint Paul will only be able to make 1% annually on new construction, and when immediately across the border in Minneapolis, they could get 5%+, they just won't finance new construction. They have limited capital, and they, on average, won't dump it into a less profitable project when they could spend it on a more expensive one.

At this point, the analysis is pretty straightforward: at 3%, existing landlords will take their properties out of the rental market if they can, and developers and financiers won't finance new construction. This will drastically reduce the supply of rentable units over time and actually *increase* rents across the region. Saint Paul's 3% rent cap, then, will exclude low-income residents from the region by reducing the supply of rentable units, even if a small subset of them remain rent-controlled.

This isn't to say that rent control is always the wrong policy; applied surgically, carefully, and prudently, rent control can save a lot of heartache for communities, and that's worth something. Ultimately, though, the long-term, collective impact of a blanket rent control policy like Saint Paul's will be negative.

In my opinion, the better solution than rent control is just to unleash housing supply by deregulating the market (the urbanist perspective, and one Minneapolis has embraced.) If supply is actually meeting demand, landlords won't be able to increase rent inordinately or people will just move. In the interim, careful rent control policies could serve us well, but Saint Paul's probably ain't it (maybe Mayor Carter's tinkering will fix it though.)",t2_3tn6uqi5,jcmcgough,0,1647537074.0,0,t1_i11i0js,i11i0js,False,dmau9600,t3_tgbbuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/,"Minnesota Senate committee votes to cancel rent control ordinances in Minneapolis, St. Paul",/r/saintpaul/comments/tgbbuq/minnesota_senate_committee_votes_to_cancel_rent/i11i0js/,1,r/saintpaul,0,1

"I see it both ways, honestly. I think there should be affordable options for people, and that does start with adding MORE options. That said, land developers and landlords typically don‚Äôt run non-profits, and won‚Äôt build in an area where they can‚Äôt make money. So without companies building, you won‚Äôt have additional spaces for people. 

While I agree, we should have affordable housing, I think the rent control measures went a little too far. Capping increases to 3% a year is problematic once you take into account interest rates, utility increases and taxes. Essentially, unless you price your rental correctly to account for future cost increases, you will eventually lose money. (I know, boo hoo)

Additionally, even if the unit is NOT rented and is sitting vacant, you are still not allowed to increase the rental price by more than 3% a year. So, basically landlords will have to overprice their rental units ahead of time to account for future increases, which will just raise all rents in the area.

With all of that said, I do agree that we need to do something to protect lower income people from being priced out of their own neighborhood. I rented an apartment and I remember having to move because the rent went up $200 a month. 

I think the most realistic way to approach this issue is to tie the increases to a moving target, like say interest rates or tax increases percentage than just coming up with an arbitrary number. Either that or incentivize rental businesses to rent to lower income families by giving them tax breaks/refunds.

"I moved to St Paul in 1970. Many of the descriptions given on this subject sound like it‚Äôs 1970. Again. This past summer in what people here would describe as a nice neighborhood I woke up to the sound of my dog telling me something was in the back yard. I didn‚Äôt think much of it. It was still dark. Maybe a rabbit. Found out later that  the St. Paul Police were in my back yard with a Police Dog looking for a young man who a hour before had stolen a car 2 blocks from my nice neighborhood home and then struck and murdered a 50 year old neighbor out for his normal early morning walk. 
The police were nice enough to leave the gate to my yard open so my dog could get loose as I let her out later that morning. As they searched every yard on my block they left every gate open. 
I have never heard that they caught the nice young man who murdered my neighbor. 
I was just grateful that I didn‚Äôt let my dog out while police with a dog in the dark were in my back yard without knocking on my door to alert me. My dog would have not fared well in her yard with that encounter. 
Last year we had record area murder numbers. After a cold winter we are on par to set a new record this year. 
Where do you folks live?  It sure isn‚Äôt Record Breaking St Paul. 1970. I weep for this town. Enjoy La La land.

Their metric *** (1) is obviously biased towards ""stuff you can walk to"" vs good PUBLIC schools, low crime, etc. They also ignored SUBURB, and TOWN - ""City Neighborhood"" was the only box checked. Sorry, 50th and France, etc. 

Start adjusting the criteria and you might end up with Deephaven (Wayzata) or Medina, instead.

"There are frequent posts on this subreddit and other local ones asking if St. Paul or Minneapolis are safe. I'm never sure what exactly is being asked. Do you mean personal safety? Are you asking about property crime? Is it about perception of risk or actual risk (the former is personal and depends on a number of factors, the latter is just data). I'm a 6'4"" straight, white man, so I  don't feel unsafe as much as many other people might, for example, if you are a woman or identify as queer or trans. Crime is also not evenly spread across a population or geographic area. It can be concentrated in very specific areas (like a particular bar) or limited to parties that already know each other. 

As another poster commented, some neighborhoods can vary block to block. One block might have a problem corner bar or a single house that attracts problems. I've lived in St. Paul (Hamline-Midway) for seven years and love it.

"I've lived within a mile of downtown for 20 years now. No issues. No burglaries, nothing stolen from my yard, no vandalism, no threats, and the only ""is that gunfire?"" comes from the kiddies on the neighborhood Facebook and Nextdoor pages. That's not a universal experience; I had a neighbor many people didn't like and he had some stuff stolen from his yard and some loud arguments outside his place. But it's been pretty quiet here. 

I would argue, though, that living within city limits is cheaper than the burbs. Despite what the people in the burbs like to think, enough people want to live in St. Paul that housing prices have gone way up in certain neighborhoods. Actually, they've gone up in *all* neighborhoods and while there are parts of some neighborhoods you probably won't feel safe in, get a few blocks away in the same neighborhood and the streets get much quieter.

Living in the city you probably won't spend buckets of money feeding and caring for a car because you have to drive everywhere you want to go in the suburbs. I can walk to a decent grocery store and restaurants/bars and liquor, the library, and a rec center, and bike to more groceries, a drug store, more restaurants/bars and another rec center. Multiple bus lines, too. 

So do the math. Find out what houses you might like will cost and then look at the property taxes for that house. It may be cheaper than the suburbs and paying 59 cents a mile for fuel and wear and tear on a car.

"Ultimately it is the responsibility of the property owner to clear snow on the PUBLIC walkway/sidewalk. It is also the property owner‚Äôs responsibility to clear snow on the access walkways and stairs on the property for you. If someone is injured slipping on ice, the property owner is sued - not the tenants. 

You will have to bug the landlord about clearing snow on the stairs/walkway to your unit. Good luck with that. If I were you I would offer to shovel for the property in exchange for a break on rent and get that in writing or at least an email vs a verbal agreement. I used to do my own repairs on my unit and send my landlord a bill for parts and labor (a modest $20/hr) with pics - this was greatly appreciated because it‚Äôs a lot more convenient for us both this was than if I called him, he called the guy, waiting, etc.

The PUBLIC walkway is another story - you can file a formal complaint the city (YOU SHOULD DO THIS) and the property owner will get a letter warning them to shovel and explain the consequences if they don‚Äôt (city will clear the snow and owner will get a fat bill from the city) In St. Paul it is easy to file a complaint online.

"I bought in City Walk 2.5 years ago and am glad I did. The building is exceptionally quiet and very well maintained. Internet is not part of the HOA dues but you can have good options. Obviously Comcast, but I recently dropped them for Verizon 5G Home and it has been a HUGE change for the better. The building amenities are due for some updating but the board is good about managing the funds to not over extend on projects. The pool and deck are quite nice and get a ton of use in warmer months but are never ‚Äúbusy.‚Äù I like that are HOA dues are comparatively lower than other buildings in the area.

Consider a cake doughnut. It‚Äôs wheel-shaped, laden with sugar or glaze and dense ‚Äî at times, a little too heavy for my liking. Now, take that regular cake doughnut and add some bounce and levity to the dough (in the form of glutinous rice flour) and a bulbous shape (think eight small spheres of dough connected to form a ring). And there you have it: a mochi doughnut.

Mochi doughnuts have become trendy among U.S. foodies in the past two years, and they have finally arrived in Minnesota by way of Soga Mochi Donut, the new doughnut kiosk in St. Paul‚Äôs Dragon Star Oriental Foods.

Soga‚Äôs co-founder, Bella Zhan, originally fell in love with these doughnuts when she was studying and living in Japan. In Tokyo, there‚Äôs a beloved doughnut chain called Mister Donut, which popularized the mochi doughnut (also known as the pon de ring doughnut). Every day, Zhan would traverse back from school and pick up a Mister Donut mochi doughnut along the way. Mochi doughnuts are sold in Hawaii, California and New York, but, when Zhan was doing research, there were none in Minnesota. ‚ÄúWhen I came back to the U.S., I really missed that texture, that taste of the doughnut. So that‚Äôs when I started to create a plan to open a mochi doughnut shop,‚Äù Zhan said.

Soga Mochi Donut offers mainstay mochi doughnut flavors that include an original mochi doughnut and a churro mochi doughnut, along with four flavors of the week that change each Monday ‚Äî some past flavors include matcha doughnuts made with ceremonial grade matcha powder from Japan, Oreo, pistachio and yuzu. Zhan seeks inspiration for the weekly flavors by perusing the ice cream section of Target and compiling a list of different flavor possibilities on her Notes app.

These scratch-made doughnuts incorporate glutinous rice flour into the batter to create a chewy, elastic texture. This flour is naturally higher in starch, which lends a bouncier mouthfeel to the treat. The doughnuts come out hot with a golden and crisp exterior, and they go down bite by bite, chewy and light. According to Zhan, on any given weekend day, the shop sells around 1,800 to 2,000 doughnuts.

Though Zhan‚Äôs mochi doughnut shop is Minnesota‚Äôs first, it won‚Äôt be Minnesota‚Äôs last. The soon-to-open Bober Tea and Mochi Dough in Dinkytown is slated to open sometime this spring. Who knows where else folks will find these doughnut delights in Minnesota in the coming months? But for now, Zhan is elated to introduce Minnesotans to the magic of the mochi doughnut.

"I mean I‚Äôd use it. Being able to go to Duluth without having to drive? Once your there how much do you really need a car? I like walking around canal park, grabbing a beer and maybe walking around downtown. That‚Äôs all within a few miles of each other. If I could do that all without a car and having to pay for parking or whatever sign me up. 

College students who have family in the twin cities I‚Äôd imagine would use it too. I went to school in Fargo and I would have given anything for the empire builder to show up consistently on time (lol) and not show up at the butt crack of dawn (it showed up at like 2 and 4 in the morning at least scheduled). 94 between Fargo and the Twin Cities is legit a horrible drive. 

I‚Äôm obviously a homer with this project but here‚Äôs something for people that don‚Äôt see the value. No matter if the line is initially popular, or if the passenger train gets canceled in 5 years, the double trackage, the upgraded rail and speed, the updated rail crossing will all still be an asset for the state. Freight railroads (the BNSF) would be able to run 80 mph freight trains (110 rating for passenger usually isn‚Äôt what freight is rated for) with huge sidings  will allow for more freight traffic.

Does this require a full stop? Also what would be needed as far as rail infrastructure and tech to bump the speed up a bit?

I used to work in the rail industry and I 100% believe it, because, as you mentioned, all the sidings required for trains to pass each other. BNSF will probably always de-prioritize passenger trains as well, so you'll be taking the siding pretty much 100% of the time there's any conflict.

Turnouts themselves on sidings require certain speed limits according to their geometry and just... physics (or you'll derail), so the slow down is pretty much inevitable.

The way to make it more efficient is to study frequent points of conflict, then just put in dual-track for those areas.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶I see the ridership will be, is just not going to be worth it,‚Äù Rarick said‚Äù*

If it‚Äôs not an option for people of course the projected ridership numbers will be low. If you build it they will come.

"I‚Äôve been in the area since about 2015. It‚Äôs definitely a bit quieter now than it has been pre-pandemic, but it does have its more active moments. Saturdays with the farmers market, Saints games, and the Saint Paul art crawl make the area of a busier, and fun to be in the warmer months. The winter months are definitely a bit quiet, not much happens here beyond the winter carnival parade in January.

The light rail transit station is pretty active, and it does have some houseless folk that are there. However, that station is under constant watch by metro transit police. Even late at night and early in the morning there are officers there. I do frequent the light rail pretty often, and I do have the safe line number for metro transit saved to my phone to reach out in a bad situation. 

My best piece of advice is, if financially possible, support the local restaurants in the area as often as you can. Lowertown has had a string of restaurants come and go in the six years I‚Äôve been here. A lot of restaurants that open up here, even now, depend on local traffic beyond a lot of the events in order to stay active. While it‚Äôs been nice to enjoy a dinner or two surrounded by pretty much just local residents, it‚Äôs been awfully quiet with few people in the restaurants and it‚Äôs concerning since I do like quite a bit of them.",t2_jxyuk,Ihatebird,0,1646858509.0,0,t1_i00ojyd,i00ojyd,True,sabbyteur,t3_taem7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/taem7a/if_you_live_in_lowertown_how_is_it_doing_since/,"If you live in Lowertown, how is it doing since the start of the pandemic?

"Lived at The Cosmopolitan from June 2019 to June 2021. The area is nice, especially with the transit access. I have Wolves season tickets and would regularly take the train from Union Depot to Target Center (sometimes the 94 depending on the time). The Union Depot station is fairly safe, that might be since there are always transit police there although I kind of question how effective they truly are. Even though I own a car, I really like using public transit, especially if I'm going somewhere with expensive parking (an added plus is that I can booze it up). The various farmer's markets are also nice. The big one is obviously near the Saints Stadium, but during the weekdays there are also some near the Palace Theatre that often are cheaper.  
  
The main reason that I moved to Lowertown was since I worked in downtown Saint Paul and could walk to work. I spent a lot of time in  the skyway as a kid since my mom worked at Ecolab, so there are also good memories for me. There certainly are a lot more homeless people now, but that is sort of to be expected with so many people being ruined financially by the pandemic as well as the city's policy on treating homelessness like whack-a-mole.",t2_6wgzl,nrag726,0,1646853921.0,0,t1_i00ctrl,i00ctrl,True,sabbyteur,t3_taem7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/saintpaul/comments/taem7a/if_you_live_in_lowertown_how_is_it_doing_since/,"If you live in Lowertown, how is it doing since the start of the pandemic?

"The city of St. Paul is dogged by having a high percentage of nonprofit properties belonging to government, schools, churches, hospitals, etc. that does not pay property taxes or the right of way fees us ordinary residents and business owners pay and yet those roads still need plowing, pothole filling, etc. There's a lot less money floating around the city for maintenance. 

My additional personal thought is that Public Works has not been considered an important function in the city for many years. I think the workers on the street are just as good at their jobs as anyone anywhere but they've gotten the message for years that the department is a political reward, the people in charge often don't have any idea how to do what needs to be done, and that doing the job well has no real reward. I have had a couple of conversations with the new leader and I think they get it to a much greater degree than leaders have for many years.
