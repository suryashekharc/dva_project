"A camera can't pick up what you see with your naked eye. Or, you'd have to be extremely precise with the exposure. It's either going to pick up more stars or less. If you just take a photo, it will be totally dark. But a 30 second exposure (like what I tried in December) of the sky is going to capture stars you can't see with your naked eye. Additionally how many stars you can see will differ depending on how bright the moon is, how many lights are around (campground? primitive site), and how long you look since your eyes become adjusted after a longer period of time. Basically, *all* photos of the night sky have to use exposure settings so what you're asking isn't really possible. 

I will say, you can see the milky way easily. You can see a ton of stars. Big Bend has a gold tier dark sky rating--it's literally one of the darkest places in the world. You won't be disappointed AT ALL just looking with your naked eye. Those photos probably do contain more stars than you could see easily, and you will not see any of those pretty colors in them (they may be stacked shots incorporated sunrise/sunset into the star exposures.)

"In a place like Big Bend you can easily see the Milky Way with the naked eye.  It looks a lot like a milky cloud.  It is not as bright as your image posted but still easy to see.  The ground is not near as bright either but in the dark you will be surprised how much you can see once your eyes are acclimated to the dark.  If you have a campfire, lanterns, flashlight, and electronics going you will see much less.  But in the dark in a place like Big Bend you get quite a show.  

Even more so since there is almost no air traffic.

A camera can get an image but remember the camera is doing a long exposure and gathering light.  In a shot like you posted, probably something like a 30 second long exposure.  After you gather all that light  you then have enough data to process to something like you see.

BTW many phones can now photograph the Milky Way.  I do shots on my Google Pixel 5A.

"Getting sick or injured out there is no joke.

Back in November 2019,  I came across an injured bicyclist on Old Ore Road, about 4 miles from the northern end.  His companions were already on the phone with the NPS when I arrived.  Here is the timeline for the part of the ordeal I was involved in:

 * 01:57 - I come across the bicyclists
 * 02:18 - Border Patrol arrives (there were eventually at least 3 Border Patrol vehicles)
 * 02:41 - EMTs arrive in a Tahoe
 * 03:19 - EMTs drive off down Old Ore Road with the injured guy
 * 03:53 - EMTs arrive at Dagger Flats, where an ambulance was waiting
 * 04:08 - ambulance drives off

That was 2 hours 11 minutes from the time I encountered them until the ambulance started rolling.  And the guy's injury had happened several minutes before I arrived.

And his ordeal wasn't even close to over.  I was told that the ambulance was going to drive 40 minutes up 385,  to meet a helicopter that would be landing at the intersection of two roads.  From there the helicopter was going to fly to either El Paso or Midland,  because the guy needed to be taken to a trauma center.

"The good news is that there's really only 4 main paved roads that connect the park- Maxwell Scenic Drive, Chisos Basin Road, Main Park Road, and Park Rte 12. There are other small offshoots and primitive roads to get to specific things, but those main roads get you around the park.

The bad news is that this is a big park, everything is very far apart, and the speed limits are low through the park.

So it really depends where you plan on going. The only thing that will be a grind is going to the RGV side of the park. If you're still planning on Lost Mine and Emory then you'll be fine, just plan on about an hour each way to the basin from Cottonwood.

"It's doable, but you will want more time everywhere. I definitely recommend Santa Elena to see, but it is a looong drive from Rio grande covering the distance of the entire park. It may be best to stay on the boquillas side of the park. The Rio grande nature trail is a good short hike, and Boquillas canyon and the hot springs is closer. You could stay on that side and do more things then just driving across the park.

Once you make it out here, you will want to come back again.  Just plan on your next trip because you won't get bored out here and there is a very long list of things to do. Starting with south rim is the Pinnacle of the park, and catching sunset, sunrise and the milky way on the rim is just about the best thing to do in Texas. 

Also, the milky way will be up in the east before sunrise around 3-6 am I think.

I am hiking Emory peak next Friday and have the overnight campsite near the peak. My goal is sunset, milky way and sunrise on Emory of the weather works in my favor. After that I may hit up Terlingua since I need to charge my model 3 over there. Terlingua is also a destination in itself anytime you are in the area.

"I just stayed at one of the Fossil Knob Ridge shipping container homes a couple weeks ago in Terlingua and their Wi-Fi was fast & reliable, I was able to work normally (also an astrophoto nerd). There’s also a cell tower on that hill, so my service near the home was great. You will need more than a sedan to get back to those properties, like a 10 minute hilly, rocky, sandy trail that goes up behind the coffee shop.

At the end of the week, I joined some friends at one of the Basecamp Terlingua casitas and the Wi-Fi there was horribly slow compared to the previous rental. Also didn’t have cell service at the Basecamp property.

"So big bend was my first hiking trip (Emory peak, I am a ~runner~ and went with my hiker boyfriend so I felt comfortable doing this) and you don’t *need* hiking shoes, but honestly I highly recommend getting ankle Merrell Moab’s! I got mine off eBay ($60). I highly recommend hiking shoes, for big bend especially, due to rocks. I feel like it’s underestimated how you can hurt your foot without the hard soles that protect your feet that hiking shoes offer, especially since you mentioned you’re a newbie. People generally recommend breaking in your hiking boots too before a hike. Also if hiking is something you see yourself doing a lot in the future, it’s a good investment! If it’s just one trip though, you definitely don’t need boots! The trails are very well built there :)

Shoes. That is a personal preference many people like boots for the ankle support but they have fallen out of favor with many 

I personally dislike gortex as my feet will reek after 2-3 days even in desert climates.. that said the elevation gain is a lot if you do the south rim and or Emory peak. If you are unfit and don't have strong ankles boots would have the benefit of ankle support

"I'm choosing to read your comment as ""Go to a park where you can filter water, so you don't have to carry all of it. And where you can actually dig a cathole so you don't have to carry that either."" Big Bend is nice, it's just more challenging in some ways than other climates.

Hey, /u/Kilos4daze, which campsite did you stay in? Sorry this experience was so rough, but way to roll with it. When I started backpacking, I did a quick trip to Pedernales Falls, to test my gear. If you get new stuff, maybe try it out somewhere closer to home and less intense first! 

I'd recommend a well-insulated tent made for the weather conditions, check out the R-value of your sleeping pad since that can help provide some warmth, lay on the sleeping pad in the store (REI lets you do this!), and fyi the temperature rating of a sleeping bag is the lowest bound, if you're wearing layers of clothing while in it. I tend to go to the lower temp rating for cool seasons, especially given all of the wind in West Texas. I finally got a nice 15F full-down bag last year that I can't wait to try out in some cold weather, after carrying a humongous synthetic bag for several seasons.

"I will be counter to the no RMSD contingent here.  The park is three main parts (4 with the river) east side, west side and mountains.  Ideally you would have at least three days to check all 3 out.  Since you are staying at RGV I would leave Stillwells before light and get to Lost Mine and do that, it is sort of the essence of the Chisos, skip the Window this trip.  Then spend your afternoon on the East side, maybe back tracking to Dog Canyon and/or Fossil bone or Balanced rock then head down towards RGV.  Do the Hot Spring that night after setting up camp and maybe dinner.

Second day drive the RMSD all the way to Santa Elena, early again, and then work your way back stopping at the many good sights- Dorgan House, Castolon, Tuff Canyon, Mule Ears overlook, Burro Mesa Pouroff and Spring, Sotol Vista and Homer Wilson overlook, Sam Nail ranch.  Many good day hikes, short and long from those.  The west side is much more spectacular than the east, at least much different.  Getting going early is the key here and remember that sunrise is much later in the park than you are used to where ever you are from because it is so far west in the time zone.

Some of this depends on when and how you are leaving the park.

South Rim is amazing, but unfortunately it's probably not going to work with your 2 day itinerary.

The road to balanced rock is rough, but it's a great little hike.

I'd skip Ross maxwell for now, Chisos Basin and RGV area are better. Boquillas Canyon is nice.

"Your plan is good.

With 2 days I would skip Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive and Santa Elena Canyon.  That can easily be a full day. Save for a future trip.

Definitely do the Fossil Discovery Exhibit.  Super cool museum that is open air.

Dog Canyon is a great hike.  Flat and about 4 miles round trip.  Skip Devil's Den.  It's basically an unmarked walk in a dry wash and the canyon is honestly underwhelming.  

From the RGV campground you can do the short nature trail up to the hill.  Easy hike to a great spot for both sunrise and sunset. Great views both easy and west. Highly recommended.

Hot Springs is probably going to be crowded but do go.  Water is a perfect 105 degrees. You can actually hike to Hot Springs from RGV.  Nice hike but I would drive over if you just want to soak.

Boquillas Canyon is a decent short hike.

If you did Dog Canyon and Fossil Discovery Exhibit Monday morning I would say just spend the rest of Monday around RGV. Between Hot Springs, Boquillas Canyon and the nature trail you would be good for rest of day.

Tuesday could then be Lost Mine, Window and Balanced Rock.  Stop at Dugout Wells on way back to RGV.

"Be at the Lost Mine traiilhead as early as possible, 730 AM should be early enough to have an uncrowded hike. The Lost Mine is a great hike, better with few people around.

Do go to Boquillas Canyon, you are close, it's very cool, it's a short, fun, easy hike to a great destination. Dugout Wells is worth a short stop

Everyone should see Balanced Rock out in Grapevine Hills. Great place to watch the sun go down or just have fun amongst boulders. There is more than one rock balanced out there.

The Window is most often done from The Basin. You can get to The Window from the Oak Spring Cutoff side. Very different hikes, both are really good hikes, From The Basin it's a slight decline through a canyon to The Window and a slight incline on the way back. From the Oak Spring Cutoff side the trail zig and zags acoss the mountain up to a pass about a quarter mile from The Window.

"Being able to get a back road site would be my biggest concern.  The park has become too popular and I believe literally every campsite is taken every night these days.  

Plan on being at the PJ visitor center by 0700 to be in line for when then open. I believe you can get a spot one night in advance. So on the 1st you could book for the 2nd. 
You can then book for several consecutive nights. So you should have to wait in line only once and then be able to book spots for the entire trip.  Note, you could book different sites too this way.  So Tally one night and Buenos Aires the next as an example.

With a Bronco and Jeep you should be good for the side roads to places like Tally where the roads have deep ruts that would stop a Subaru. Black Gap is probably the toughest road. My buddy took his 4x4 Ram there once and said....never again....

Any of the camps along the river will be neat.  Zero shade but super quiet with dark sky.

Fresno campsite is next to the Mariscal Mine and is one of my faves.  Especially if you want to photograph the mine.  

Last idea.  If the national park is full maybe try the state park. Need 4x4 for most sites there too but might be less crowded.

Have fun.  Post pics.

"Big Bend is a tough place to be a beginner for backpacking. Unlike Colorado, you have to carry all your water.  It makes going out for more than 2 nights all but impossible. So consider yourself a glutton for punishment 😀

I would consider 5 liters per day a minimum in Big Bend. 6 would be better

I find I drink a liter of water as soon as I get up every day in the park. It's very dry and you wake up thirsty. To me the one gallon per person is too little water. Take extra.

I did an April overnight to South Rim. Just up and down Laguna Meadows trail. Noon to noon.  I took 9 liters. I got back dry.  If I was adding in Emory Peak I would have taken 12 liters. 

Expect hot days in the 90s. Expect chilly nights in low 40s.

"Sounds like a good time! I did this overnight last June, planning on another trip this summer as well. 

The recommendation I've typically seen for the mountain loops (which are cooler than the lower desert) is one gallon per 24 hours. I carried 3 gallons for two people. We ran dry a mile or so from the end, probably could have used another gallon because it was so hot.

Someone in my group carried two gallon jugs by hand. Seemed miserable, but doable. 

Someone else linked a nice water bladder. They're very useful as they can fit in your backpack close against your body and in the middle of the back, making it more efficient to carry. If you pack well and have a nice container that distributes the weight correctly, it doesn't feel as heavy as it is. I used a 10L and it really didn't feel that heavy.

Honestly, it was so hot that we didn't feel like eating the  dehydrated backpacking food. The dry goods were much more palatable. 

If you do bring dehydrated food, you don't need to bring ""extra"" water for cooking, as whatever you use for cooking and end up consuming will hydrate you just as well.

"I did it starting with Pinnacles the other day (just the rim, not Emory). I don't see any reason to do both honestly. Nice views both ways, but I'd start with Laguna early because it doesn't have a lot of shade and the views on Pinnacles and boot canyon are better, in my opinion. Laguna was HOT descending at noon, Pinnacles had more shade. 

 It's not that steep, it's just long. And the trails (especially Pinnacles) are very well maintained and have lots of switchbacks. I'd rate the south rim as ""moderate"" overall.

"I've only done Black Gap once, several years ago.  The road itself is narrower with more sections you may want to walk before driving.  The first 'challenge' I remember at the southern end was dropping into an arroyo then climbing the very steep other side out. I was surprised that my truck did it so easily. The vehicles capabilties exceed that of the driver! Then there is the Gap itself, a narrow volcanic gap in a hill. There are a lot raised rocks go you have to go over, no where else to go. At the end of the Gap there is a drop, here you may or may not need to pile up rocks.  Plenty of YouTube videos about his part.

There is a section of shelf road, you know mountain on one side ,nothing on the other. For me this was the scariest part. It's short and really nothing to worry about, easy to say looking back! That's the end of the details I remember.

So why do I drive the OOR repeatedly and Black Gap once? You drive, Black Gap, it's cool, challenging and some people want to drive every road in the park, me for instance.

">  I prefer to go from north to south, it just unfolds better that way. 

I've done it twice.  First time from the north,  second time from the south.

South was better for me personally for three reasons:  

1)  I started early in the morning both times,  so driving from the north meant driving into the rising sun.

2)  Both times I went the week before Thanksgiving,  which is a busy time at the park.  When I did it from the north,  I was finishing up in the early afternoon and there was a steady stream of traffic to Ernst Tinaja.  The second time,  I had Ernst Tinaja to myself for the entire 50-ish minutes I was there.

3)  There is a great overlook on the northern part of the road,  just north of that descent to McKinney Spring.  If you drive it from the south,  you hit it near the end of your journey.  It's a great place to stop for half and hour or so and have some lunch.  

> The first time I drove the OOR I was dreading the harder parts, by the third time I was looking forward to the harder parts.

This is an excellent point that your experience level can impact how you feel about the road.  The first time I did it I was *extremely* inexperienced,  and there were many parts that made me nervous.  The second time,  there was only one thing that made me nervous (It actually made me say ""whaaaaat the f***,  I don't remember this"" out loud, LOL).  It was a boulder thing that I had to climb that had been a descent when coming from the north.  

There was a guy on this sub a year or two ago who was thinking about taking his girlfriend's Subaru Outback on the road rather than his Canyon/Colorado,  because the Subi would have been more comfortable to drive to the park.

""No Rinse"" shampoo and body bath.  You can order it on Amazon.  It *might* also be sold at Academy.

I've used it camping,  and I used it for the 2 weeks I did not have running water at home after last year's deep freeze.

The shampoo is used straight out of the bottle.  The body bath is mixed with water;  I used a 2-liter soda bottle.

> bathrooms

You can buy a toilet seat that snaps onto a standard 5-gallon bucket.  I think I got mine at Academy.  Then dump some clumping kitty litter in the bucket.  It's like 100 times better than pooping a hole.

>  Any other advice about ... camping in general would be greatly appreciated.

Flashlights.  If you're going to be moving around at night,  you'll  want flashlights (including a small one to keep on you at all times).  If you are going to be doing anything that requires working with your hands in the dark,  a headlamp is pricesless.  If you're going to be hanging around in a tent in the evening,  maybe a an electric ""lantern"" of some sort.

Entertainment.  You might wind up with some time to kill each evening.  Back in the day,  I would bring a book to read at night.  Nowadays you might load up some media on a tablet and and catch up on a TV show or something (but bring headphones so other people don't have to listen to it).

Campground Paving Closure: Spring 2022

In April 2022, crews will pave the roads and vehicle pads within the Chisos Basin Campground. This will require closure of the entire campground and group campground for a period of approximately 3 weeks. To ensure that reservations are not cancelled, all campsites are currently unavailable for reservations during that time.

Once the actual dates for this project are established, campsites will be released for reservations. Stay tuned for more updates.""

You are overestimating the bears in Big Bend. You'll be just fine cooking inside or outside. The bears won't break into your van and if you cook outside they won't come attack while cooking. Black bears are pretty skittish and not aggressive unless protecting their cubs. Black bears are scavengers and they'll come eat food if left out or in a tent they can easily rip open.

"The campground itself is pretty safe. There's a slight chance you could have a bear or javelina come through, or even a bobcat, but there's a lot of people around and you should be ok. And the campsites are pretty small and close together, so she'd be ok socializing with you in the campsite on a leash if you'd prefer not to van her the whole time. Down on the hot springs trail, you might have javalina or some transient horses and cows from the Mexico side, but again there's usually lots of people and you should be ok. I'd be a little more wary on the balanced rock trail, not because of animals but the terrain. It's a sandy wash with gravel, and there's is a decent rock scramble to get up to the actual balanced rock. I can also get pretty hot. Make sure to watch those little paws and take lots of water!

Overall, the park is most dangerous and least dog friendly in the backcountry. But where you are planning to go it shouldn't be worrisome. Just be careful of rocks, snakes, cacti, stinging/biting creepy-crawlies, etc. Those are probably more of a hazard in the more populated areas you mentioned.",t2_9plix,Hambone76,0,1646075786.0,0,t1_hytbzie,hytbzie,False,plum-pey,t3_t3n08x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBendTX/comments/t3n08x/service_dog/,Service Dog,/r/BigBendTX/comments/t3n08x/service_dog/hytbzie/,3,r/BigBendTX,0,3

"> Have you tried Old Maverick Road?

That's a normal gravel road.  Not a ""primitive dirt road"" like River Road and Old Ore Road.  But I have done it and it's a nice drive that takes you to Santa Elena Canyon.  And one of the side drives off of it is pretty cool.

>  Years ago on a school trip we went to Earnst Tinaja on a rented 12 seater van and that puppy took those turns and dips like a champ. So I guess my view of OOR is a bit skewed. 

No,  OOR is legit.    People get a skewed view of it if *all* they have done is drive to Ernst Tinaja from the south.  That barely gives you a hint of what lies ahead.

It is good that you are treating it with respect.  But you do have a truck that can do it.

You should do a ""Newbie Expectations vs Reality"" post after you get back.  Would be useful for other people.  The questions you ask come up every year.

> We usually do three days out there but this time we want to do a full week, so I'm really excited about it. I love it out there!

I went canoeing, hiking, and rafting out there several times during the 90s.  I saw one of the 4x4 signs and said to myself,  ""Some day.""

> We have no experience. Just got the truck last year, it's a 2019.

"I was bone stock.

I have what is basically a Recovery Kit 101:  recovery points,  Maxtrax,  kinetic recovery rope,  snatch strap,  air compressor,  tire patch kit,  hand tools,  first aid kit.  Didn't need to use anything except the air compressor in the park. 

I did need to use my e-locker once on Old Ore Road.  I was crossing a dry wash at an angle,  and got crossed up with a front wheel off the ground and the opposite rear wheel off the ground.  Got wheel spin front and rear.  The locker got me out with no trouble.  Without it,  I would have needed to pile some rocks under the wheels to get traction.

I used the locker in a couple other places preemptively.  It basically lets me crawl over stuff with less wheelspin.

How much experience do you have? IMHO,  Old Ore is sketchier than people give it credit for - especially for newbies.  Last year or so,  a guy here on this sub was trying to decide whether to take his girlfriend's Outback or his mid-size truck (Canyon/Colorado,  IIRC).  Some people told him the Subi was fine.  I told him I had helped rescue a Subi on OOR and implored him to take the truck.  He wound up taking the truck and *still* turned around because some of the drops he had to go down made his nervous.

I recommend you start by doing all of River Road.  It's 50 miles through the heart of the park,  with several different types of terrain - plus you get to stop at Mariscal Mine.  That drive alone is epic.  (I recommend East to West.  West is more difficult so you get to work up to it.  And you don't have to drive into the rising sun.)

If River Road works for you and is no problem,  try Old Ore Road the next day.  Old Ore is my favorite road in the park.  (I recommend South to North.  If you start early you beat the crowds to Ernst Tinaja,  you build up the difficulty more slowly,  and you don't drive into the sun.)

Don't try Black Gap.  I did it once,  during my 2nd trip there,  and it was marginal.  I crunched my mudflaps multiple times (but they popped back out),  and came reeeeeally close to banging a rocker panel.  I won't do it again unless I get some armor.  Back Gap doesn't have any views better than the other roads;  it's mostly about the 4x4 experience.

I think you're good to go with your truck,  but you should have recovery points.  Receiver hitch on the rear would be fine,  and is a self-install.  I don't recommend using the hook on front as a recovery point;  I mounted a front recovery point from Habitat Offroad.  I'll mount a second one if I can get my OEM hook off;  I broke a socket last time I tried.  There's a thread on ClubFrontier about recovery points.

"Thanks so much for your insight! Initially, I was pumping myself up that my SUV would be enough and could handle it, but I guess I really should have opted for an SUV that also had the 4x4 capability. 

Yeah I was using Google earth to “travel” down the road and while not a lot of photos were added, you can definitely see enough of it to make you feel uneasy. Also was able to get a sense for how long it was! If I were to go there, I would definitely have factored in the time to get there and made it part of the trip.

"I camped Willow Tank in March of 2021 so relatively recently but the road conditions have likely changed a little since then. 

Like others have mentioned here, the beginning of Old Ore Road near Ernst Tinaja is easily manageable, but beyond that it changes dramatically and there were a few different spots where the 4WD of my 2020 Forester Sport really came in handy. On the way out of camp I was pretty certain I was going to get stuck at a certain part (steep sideways downhill with a large dip in the rockpile right at the bottom) so I actually got out and piled up some rocks in the low spot just in case. Still ended up bottoming out there but made it out. I did see a few Jeeps manage that part with relative ease, but I would definitely worry about a 2WD vehicle making it through there. Also keep in mind that Willow Tank is 10 miles down Old Ore Rd, so it takes upwards of 30min - 1hr to get up the road depending on road/vehicle conditions, just something to factor in when making plans. 

The campsite itself is nice with one complaint, the bear box had been shot and had bullet holes in it, slightly defeating the purpose of the box.

"> My vehicle while high clearance ... is not 4x4- do y'all think this would still be ok?

No.  The signs are up there for a reason.  I saw a Subaru Outback get stuck out there near the mid-point of the road.

> Looks like the northern portion of the road is the most dicey, and since Willow is slam dunk in the middle, that's where my concerns tended to lie. 

It ABSOLUTELY gets worse.  Way,  way worse.   

In just about every one of these threads where people ask these questions,  two things happen:

1) People who have driven only to the Ernst Tinaja from the south try to extrapolate their experience to the entire road.  But you can drive to the Ernst Tinaja in just about anything.  So their comments are misleading,  if not dangerous.

2)  Super-experienced people chime in and say all the roads in the park are easy and you don't need 4x4 to do any of them.   But an experienced person who took a beater Jeep out there has a different perspective than someone who is taking their $50k daily driver out there.  

And pretty much all of those people who say you don't need 4WD still actually *had it*,  they just *didn't use it*.  It would be like my saying you don't need a spare tire because I never had to use mine, LOL.


**IMHO**

People of normal skill in their daily drivers need 4x4.   There are stair-step like things that I could have bashed my Nissan Frontier over in 2WD,  but 4WD made it a piece of cake.  

The Border Patrol is out there in Tahoes and F250s.  I've seen fullsize pickups on the road.  But they are all 4x4.

Like I said,  I saw a Subaru Outback get stuck around the mid-point.  His AWD and lack of articulation was not good enough.

Hell, I myself got stuck *in a 4x4 pickup*.  I was crossing a benign-looking dry wash at an angle,  got one front wheel and the opposite rear wheel unloaded,  and just started spinning wheels front and rear.  Open diffs FTL.  But I did have rear OEM e-locker,  and that got me out.",t2_a0yhmpe7,ItselfSurprised04,0,1645236789.0,0,t1_hxj15ij,hxj15ij,False,alooshka,t3_svm2my,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBendTX/comments/svm2my/willow_tank_campground_drivability_old_ore_road/,Willow Tank Campground Drivability - Old Ore Road,/r/BigBendTX/comments/svm2my/willow_tank_campground_drivability_old_ore_road/hxj15ij/,3,r/BigBendTX,0,3
"Start at Puerta Chilicote trailhead in the interior. The hike to Fresno Canyon overlook is great (~2.5 mi). From there, hike back to the main trail and continue south and there are some good overlooks. I did the hike I'm describing in '19 and it was great. I can't remember the mileage but it was a great hike. That trailhead gives you a ton of great options from shorter hikes to backpacking loops.

The Contrabando Loop is also worth doing. Hike it out to the old factory/homestead, have lunch, then continue the loop back. If you're confident with a little bushwhacking, follow Fresno Creek back but there's no obvious exit point from the wash so you'll have to study your topo carefully but I found a spot that involved only a 6-8' climb out and a few hundred yards of bushwhacking before I was back on the contrabando trail.

"Sure, I should have clarified on the knowledge that it was backcountry. I am very comfortable with that style. Better phrasing on my part should have been campsite. 

That's the vibe I got from Old Ore Road- as long as it hasn't rained or looks like it's going to rain, I'll go ahead and plan on that being a pretty ok place to be able to drive to in my vehicle. I would love to be able to enjoy the skies. 

From what I have seen on other posts, like you mentioned the rain can cause wash outs and ruts so be on the lookout for that weather. I'll also make sure to air up my tires and check on the spare before I head out. I'll def have plenty of water in any case!

"First off, Willow Tank is just a backcountry campsite, not a campground. Don't expect any amenities. You're going to have a flat area for a tent and a bear box, otherwise nothing else around you but open desert.

Old Ore Road is a dirt road with lots of gravel and rocks. Typically, as long as its dry then high clearance is fine,  but if there's a chance of rain then you'll want 4x4. The last time I drove it was a couple years ago, back then it was rough but totally passable by normal vehicles. I've since heard that rain has washed out parts and caused a lot more rutting and rougher travel, so hopefully someone can give a better update. If nothing else, call and ask Panther Junction about the current state. Regardless, make sure you have at least 1 spare and lots of water with you. It's very easy to get a puncture on the rocks and there is little to no cell service out there. You might wait a while for help.

All that being said, it is a beautiful and isolated area of the park. Expect awesome skies and sunsets, with nobody to bother you (except maybe someone at the Ernst Basin campsite across the ways).

Edit: [Here's a shot from 2018 of Old Ore Rd just south of Ernst Tinaja](https://imgur.com/PBi1JIo).

"Stop at the rangers station at BBRSP and talk to them.  I forget her name, but there was a female ranger who lives on the property and she gave us a ton of advice when we were out there.  She told us that every once in a while someone will bring her some fresh produce (fruits and veggies) and they love it.  I guess they don't get that much out there.  ;-)  


We stayed at Papalote Nuevo.  Great campsite and there was nobody else around.  One day we hiked down the hill to the dry river bed and followed that several miles downstream.  Great hike.  Saw javelina.  Coming back was more difficult and we ended up going off trail for quite a bit of it.  The ranger basically told us to go wherever we wanted...no place was off limits, so we did.

One of the other days, we did what I think is called Puerta Chilicote Trail.  We did the whole circle part of it and then decided we weren't done yet so we hiked out to Fresno Canyon Overlook.  Puerta Chilicote was an okay hike crossing over some riverbeds and seeing some old rock paintings, but Fresno Canyon was really cool.  The hike itself was a lot of up and down, but the view at the end was incredible.  Well worth the trip.

Suppose the weird mofo you pick up freaks out when you go through the Border Patrol checkpoint (even though they mostly ignore you going into the park),  and unloads his drug stash in your car without you knowing.  Then when you are leaving the park the Border Patrol finds it?

"While you would probably find a free standing tent to be more convenient at times, the trade off is weight. The lightest tent options are not free standing. And even a free standing tent will need to be staked out when the wind comes up.  I highly recommend titanium nail stakes made by Vargo. These can be hammered in with rocks in most plates. I carry just a couple of the nail stakes, and use them to make pilot holes for my lighter j-hook stakes.

I have a fairly light free standing tent, but in all of my backpacking trips to Big Bend I have opted for a non free standing tent for weight savings.

"I hiked the exact path you are planning back in December. I highly recommend it. If you can, staying a night out in the backcountry would make it even better.

I’ve also done Pinnacles -> Boot Canyon -> East Rim -> South Rim -> Laguna Meadows as a day hike if you’re looking for a little more hiking. It’s also a beautiful hike, but it will take a bit longer than the above route.

As for hiking alone, you will be fine. There will be plenty of people on the trail in March. I’ve encountered bears in Big Bend, but they’ve never been aggressive or wanted anything to do with me. I saw one about halfway up the Casa Grande Peak trail and another near the Laguna West campsites. I’ve been going to Big Bend for years and these are the only instances I’ve had of encountering potentially dangerous wildlife (including snakes and mountain lions).

As for water, take a gallon a day unless you know for sure you can deal with less. Even then, it’s better to carry extra weight than to run out of water. There are exactly 0 accessible water sources in the Chisos.

The lost mine trail is also amazing. You will have stunning views of the valley surrounded by mountains such as Lost Mine, Casa Grande, Crown Mountain, and Crown Mountain West. However, on the South Rim you’ll have peaks such as Toll Mountain, Emory Peak, and Townsend Point. If you do decide to do the Lost Mine trail, get to the trailhead early.

I have had moments backpacking (a long way from water) in March that were legitimately scary. Even in the winter, the heat can be exhausting. The Dodson trail has virtually no shade.

"Bring drinking water, lots of it. Once there you can fill up a 5gal water can a day at any of the stations. Enough food and snacks to last you the entire trip and back. Any pets? Consider extra water, food and snacks. Take a can or two of Wasp spray. Sun tan lotion, Weather in Texas is very unpredictable it may get chilly at night, warm gear and blankets. Shades at the camp site are a major problem, ensure you have a way to provide shade for you, your pets and love ones. The wind could be your worst enemy while setting up camp. Take strong long metal stakes if setting up a tent or shade area, a big hammer will definitely make it easy. Propane enough to last you the entire trip. How much? It all comes down on your cooking and diet habits. I always take a 20lb propane tank for anything other than cooking ie: heater, etc, and the 4ea 1lbs for the stove and my grill. I know it may sound exaggerated but I rather have more than less. Comfortable clothing and shoes are a must.

"Bring your passport if you'd like to visit Boquillas, which is across the river.  The border is open Wed through Sunday, this time of year.  

There is a nice border facility on the river.  You will pay  $5 each for a round trip across by rowboat.  The town is about 3/4 mile up a dusty road.  You can walk, get a ride, or ride a donkey.   I always eat at Jose Falcon's place, as I knew him back in the day.   He has passed away but his wife and daughter run the cafe now.  They offer a few rooms and have a curio shop.  There is another restaurant also. 

There are many families selling crafts.  This is a very remote town, and all their supplies come from Muzquiz, about 3-4 hours away.  Tourist dollars are their only income.   

Going back to the US, you will interface with a customs agent through a computer kiosk.  You slide your passport across a screen, and talk to the agent via phone.

"Camping: As has been stated, getting a site could be tough. Go to the park website to see reservation policies and check [recreation.gov](https://recreation.gov). Since you're a first time camper, I recommend staying in one of the three campgrounds instead of the backcountry roadside sites (many of which require a long drive with a 4x4 to access). The campgrounds can sometimes be very windy, so make sure you bring enough stakes and guylines for your tent. Campfires are never allowed, but still make sure you thoroughly put out your charcoal grill (if you use it) and don't leave it unattended, especially in high winds.

Also, please follow all park rules. They are there for a reason. 

Things to do:

If you do one thing, absolutely do a hike in the Chisos Mountains. They are the real crown jewel of the park. If you are healthy and not extremely out of shape, my recommendation would be the to hike to the South Rim. Starting from Chisos Basin, it is a roughly 12 mile loop. I prefer going counter-clockwise because descending the Pinnacles Trail is gorgeous. Be forewarned, it is not as easy hike. You don't have to be an athlete to do it, but if you aren't in great shape you will be tired. Just start early and take it slow on the uphill. Obviously, bring a map, water (4L per person), a flashlight, plenty of food. Also bring a jacket, a bit of TP and hand sanitizer. The Lost Mine Trail is an easier alternative. It is not as scenic, but still not bad.

IMPORTANT: The park can be extremely busy during March. If you want to go to Chisos Basin, get there early, ideally by dawn (also important for starting a long hike early). During late morning there can be an extremely long one-in-one-out line to drive into the basin. 

A visit to the west side of the park is must as well if you have the time. The Ross-Maxwell Scenic Drive is incredible (be sure to stop at the Sotol Vista Overlook). Definitely visit Santa Elena Canyon. The short hike into the canyon is worthwhile.

The hot springs are great, especially under the stars. They will certainly be very busy during the day. Late at night it may or may not be busy. 

As for gear advice, you can find camping gear advice anywhere online. Here's what I'll say:

* The desert can be very hot during the day and very cold at night. One day can be very different from the next. Bring warm clothing and clothes for hot weather. Bring a hat and sunglasses. Bring chap-stick
* It may be the desert, but it can still rain. Bring a rain jacket if you have one.
* Bring a swimsuit if you plan on visiting the hot springs
* Those foam (non-inflatable) sleeping pads can be very uncomfortable for many people. Try  whatever pad you have before bringing it.

Pro tip since you're a first-time camper: Headlamps are so much better than flashlights. 

VERY IMPORTANT: Follow all park rules. They are there for a reason. [Leave no trace](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/). Do not leave food unattended and always store it properly. Do not feed wildlife. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4_Wu1ulGro).

"So getting a camping spot will be a huge hassle as March is up there for the busiest months. I’d suggest inputting your preferred days at the site below it’ll let you know when a site opens up. 

https://campflare.com

There are campsites that are released 14 days in advance of your preferred date but I kid u not they sell out within 30 seconds so if you want to try that route be prepared for when they drop at 9am CST.

Also make sure to check this website out regarding weather is you plan to hike up in the mountains in the park like Emory peak 

https://www.mountain-forecast.com

The weather app really isn’t good for checking mountain weather reports so this should help a lot. For itineraries check out the big bend NPS site they have a bunch of them. I’d highly suggest  staying in the chisos basin as it’s by far the best campsites with the best views and make sure that the trails your picking won’t be over challenging as you are a first time hiker.

"Keep your reservation for RGV.  It will still be chilly nights in late March. Warm days but cool nights. You will be fine for noise and coolness.

Explore the east side of the park when there.  Boquillas Canyon is a short hike.  Hot Springs is a neat to soak in. You can actually hike along the canyon between Hot Springs and RGV.  Watch a sunset and sunrise from the nature trail hill right by the RGV campground. The most scenic short walk in the park. 

Maybe consider driving up to Ernst Tinaja if your vehicle can make the road there.

In the Chisos you could do the south rim hike for a long day. Or you could look at doing both Lost Mine (start early or no parking) and then the Window.  BTW, they close the road to Basin when parking fills these days. So go early or don't go.

The day you got Santa Elena Canyon, stop at Sam Nail Ranch for a 15 minute walk to some shade.  Stop at Sotol Vista for the view.

"I think your sleeping plan sounds fine.  ""Too hot"" is really a matter of opion, and whether you have breeze and other factors, but I think you'll be safe in March.  It's low elevation, but it's still desert, so the temp drops a lot a night.  

But since you have that itinerary, I'd say stick to the east side of the park and explore Boquillas canyon while you're over there.

"I've been to Big Bend over a dozen times and stayed in RGV each time. I love it and would not say it's too noisy. It's close to Boquillas (canyon and town), Hot Springs, River Road East, and Ernst Tinaja on the Ore Road. The nature trail is very pretty and my favorite as a kid, and there's lots of wildlife to see (check my profile most recent post for pics taken mostly in RGV.)

South Rim is amazing and I do highly recommend it. In my experience none of the other hikes are really ""like"" it. I also recommend the East Rim trail too which is actually my favorite part of the loop, but it adds length. It is a long trip and marked strenuous and if you're not in good shape or experienced it might be a bit steep for a day hike. I've done it as a day hike and more recently as an overnight backpacking trip. I vastly preferred the day hike but that's only because I hated backpacking and carrying stuff lol. The length is much easier doing it overnight. 

Lost Mine is beautiful if you decide to not do South Rim or even if you do decide to do South Rim. It's the most popular hike in the park for good reason, since it's a shorter length with a great payoff. I absolutely recommend it too as long as you get an early start because it has a TINY parking area and fills up immediately.

Other good hikes I like: Grapevine Hills, first bit of Blue Creek Trail (it's a one way trail that connects to the chisos basin loop, just walk the red rock canyon part and turn around.) The last time I went I was a little kid so I don't remember it very well but if you like the mountains you may also like Pine Canyon trail.

Oh! If you don't want to go all the way to South Rim maybe you could do Emory Peak via Pinnacles. That's 9 miles round-trip. I haven't done it but that's shorter and still has a beautiful payoff. 

Can't answer your first question well since I've only been in the winter in a trailer. I would not move my reservations to Cottonwood though since there are no ammentities there and it has some burn damage from a few years ago. I'm not sure it even has a bathroom, and my mom doesn't remember either. However if you're experienced with no amenities then you may like it fine and have no trouble; it's still beautiful and definitely going to be quieter and iirc the burn damage missed most of the campground. But you may also just like a backcountry campsite at that point if you really want quiet and away from people.

"I've backpacked the high Chisos in early May, and it was enjoyable except for 3-4 hours mid-day, where we hung out in the shade.  But we went through more than a gallon a day and had to make a side trip to filter water from the tinajas in boot canyon because we only took 1 gallon/day.

With the elevation difference between the south rim and the Dodson, I'd say temps will be 15 degrees higher and it would be unwise to attempt the OML.  Can it be done? sure.  Would you enjoy it? probably not.  Could you die of heat stroke?  absolutely.

If you're bent on doing it, make sure you cache water at the foot of Juniper Canyon and at Homer Wilson.  I'd also plan to do the Dodson mostly in the dark.  Get on the trail several hours pre-dawn, and plan to 'siesta' during the heat of the day if you can't make all 10 miles before 10am.  Bring something that can work as a shade shelter.

"If you try and do the outer loop and it's 100 I'm pretty sure you'll just die...   This is 100% one of the toughest hikes I've ever done.   The amount of water you need is crazy, a 10 mile hike after doing a steep ass climb the day before with 2 days of water on your back (\~40 lbs) is brutal.  After the brutal climb with 40 lbs on your back, you have to walk down shale covered trails that have started to collapse down the mountain.  Your feet can't find a good holding, so your muscles in your feet start to get destroyed balancing.  Not only that but the next day, the second day, there is next to no shade and you're walking up and down steep hills for 10 miles.

The rangers say that it is very hard to cache water at the first stash.  I would go out of my way to pay someone to drive us up there to store water.   Not only to save yourself from carrying your second day of water, but to also give you extra water for cooking the first night and first morning on the trail.

"The first bit of Blue Creek Trail is very pretty and not too strenuous. It goes up and down a little in the beginning but not much, and then it's through a creek dry wash that may have some rocks but is easy walking. I last did it in the snow in Jan 2021 and it was *gorgeous*. It obviously gains a ton of elevation when it connects to Laguna Meadows but you don't have to go that far, just the red rock spires is maybe 2-3 miles round-trip, rough estimate. 

Mariscal Mine might be another good one. It definitely has uphill walking but since the mine is so close to the parking area I wouldn't really consider it much of a hike so you may be able to do that. It's more of a destination to explore than a specific trail. You need a vehicle capable of going down the River Road though, but the east section of the road where the mine is located is a better road than the west section (or so my dad recently reported back to us.)

Dog Canyon is VERY easy. I did it just about two weeks ago and it's almost completely flat until it reaches the canyon, and then it's through a dry wash that's still pretty easy. It was probably one of the easiest hikes I've done in Big Bend. I wouldn't attempt the nearby Devil's Den if you're recovering though, I would be generous calling it a ""trail"" when it's more of a faintly-marked scramble across the desert. Requires a lot of route-finding, boulder climbing, and going through bushes and prickly things. Stick with the well-marked Dog Canyon until you feel better if you want to attempt Devil's Den.",t2_2z4svc3y,letmebebrave430,0,1642099091.0,0,t1_hsiq796,hsiq796,True,garbage_moss,t3_s2urq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBendTX/comments/s2urq5/not_too_easy_hikes/,Not too easy hikes?,/r/BigBendTX/comments/s2urq5/not_too_easy_hikes/hsiq796/,2,r/BigBendTX,0,2
"I would say you have some good suggestions here for fair day hikes. Mule Ears is a good but maybe longer one for you.  No shade but fairly level. Dog Canyon on the north side is also a reasonable and flat hike with shade in the canyon.  Just over 4 mi round trip.

Two short things to see are Sam Nail Ranch and Fossil Discovery Exhibit. Both are strolls rather than hikes but both very neat. 

Lower Burro Mesa pouroff is a good short hike.  Save upper pouroff to when you are stronger as it's longer with some scrambling and elevation change. But it's a good when when you are ready.

"IMO the SP= True Adventure.  The access road into the interior is ~28 miles and suitable for most vevhicles. From there, the roads vary. Some are about the same as Old Ore but definitely narrower.  Others are completely unmaintained.  I’ve taken a “wrong” turn out there and ended up on a trail with some thick ass desert bushes growing 5-6 feet tall straight out of the center of them.   

“Wrong” is in quotes because it is still really hard to get lost out there and this trail eventually led us where we wanted to go, but it wasn’t marked and we discovered later that we zigged when we should have zagged.  That’s the kind of experience you won’t find at the NP, however. It’s what keeps me coming back to the SP.  It is challenging.  The payoff is that because it is so challenging, almost nobody makes the trek into the backcountry of the SP.  
 
So, you can get just about as hardcore as you would like.  The best part about the SP is the solitude.  I’m serious when I say you can go 4 days without seeing another human out there.  The NP has more “spectacle” but the SP has more adventure.  Every time  I’ve taken someone with me out to the SP, they eventually utter “this is crazy…” and eventually mark it as the highlight of the trip.  It’s really hard to describe. 
 
Coming from ATX, I usually make a Sunday ~> Sunday trip starting with a few days in BBNP and finishing with a few days in BBRSP.  Getting out of BBRSP from a remote campsite takes takes 4+ hours to get back to the main road.  Usually want to break that long drive home I will stay overnight in Alpine/Marathon.
 
*forgot to mention that nearly all of the trails in BBRSP — aside from the main access road — will be much narrower than BBNP.

"Not the same person replying but I’ve driven Old Ore road a bunch.  That trailer can handle it. 
 
What are you towing it with and have you ever trailered anything off road before?  26 miles is a long way in the desert.  It’s 2hrs+ of trail.  
 
There are sections that are fairly narrow and then washes that vary in depth & grade.  They evolve when it rains, so sometimes better, sometimes worse.  Sometimes a truck ( or truck and trailer!) are coming the other direction and you will need to maneuver.  

If you are comfortable with all of this and have a solidly capable truck pulling the camper, you should definitely be fine.  
  
If you’re not comfortable with that then it couldn’t hurt to start on something not quite as long/remote for a first trip.

"Glad you’re doing this hike! It’s honestly the best in the park I just did the hike with some friends before the new year. The south rim view is easily a top 3 view I’ve had on any my hikes including Colorado 14ers. The best path to go is the pinnacles first and then laguna coming back down, you get the hardest and most steep section (pinnacles + Emory) done first and then you can coast most of the rest of the way. I will say that the scramble up Emory is short but a legitimate class 3 scramble and can be scary for some. The downclimb from the summit isn’t as bad as it seems but don’t climb anything you can’t come back down. Additionally laguna meadows seems to go on FOREVER, the end is very misleading as the switchbacks look like you’re about to be back at the basin and then switch back around. Just be prepared to grind out the last 3 or so miles.

Additionally I see a lot of people just using the weather app to see what the weathers gonna be like for their hike but it’s very inaccurate for peaks & high elevation. The link below should give you a really accurate picture of what it’s gonna be like, any rain or really high wind could make that last scramble potentially dangerous.

"Did this exact loop 1/3/2021, packed 3L of water + 2 water bottles lots of snacks and sandwiches. Got back to camp dry on all of the above. Pack lots of water and be prepared for a strenuous hike. We were at the trailhead by 8:30am and weren’t back until 4:30pm, took breaks of course. Go up Laguna to get the bulk of the miles out of the way and a more gradual elevation gain after the initial switchbacks before summitting the peak. Be prepared for a lot of switchbacks at the beginning and a relatively easy descent down pinnacles. Overall get an early start since hiking in the dark would not be ideal, bring lots of water (more than you think you’ll need), and layers. Easily the hardest but most rewarding hike my friends and I have ever done. 1000% worth it.",t2_4tae9e70,hxebryxn,0,1641845818.0,0,t1_hs3xuqh,hs3xuqh,True,Professional_Bit_264,t3_s0amod,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBendTX/comments/s0amod/south_rim_trail_w_emory_peak_in_one_day/,South Rim Trail w/ Emory Peak in one day,/r/BigBendTX/comments/s0amod/south_rim_trail_w_emory_peak_in_one_day/hs3xuqh/,2,r/BigBendTX,0,2
