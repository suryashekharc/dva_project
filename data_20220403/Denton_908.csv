"In Texas [Murder](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.19.htm#19.02) is a first degree felony, but requires a death. Attempted Murder comes under the [Criminal Attempt statute](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.15.htm#15.01) which requires proof of specific intent. So you'd have to prove that he specifically intended to commit murder, but failed since the officer didn't die. Further, the Criminal Attempt statute means that a conviction is for ""one category lower than the offense attempted"". So Attempted Murder would be a second degree felony. 

On the other hand, the charged crime, [Aggravated Assault Against a Public Servant](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.22.htm#22.02), is a first degree felony that can be proven if the Defendant recklessly caused serious bodily injury to the officer while the officer was lawfully discharging an official duty.

A person being convicted of a second degree felony is subject to imprisonment for between [two and twenty years](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.12.htm#12.33), while someone convicted of a first degree felon is subject to imprisonment for between [five and ninety-nine years, or life](https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.12.htm#12.32). There are various situations where punishment ranges can be enhanced (often, though not exclusively, relating to the state proving previous felony convictions).

There are obviously nuances to every case, but generally speaking charging Attempted Murder rather than the Aggravated Assault Against a Public Servant would mean a harder case to prove (increasing the chances of a not-guilty verdict; imagine how to prove he had a specific intent to commit murder rather than simply a reckless disregard to the safety of the officers in an attempt to avoid arrest), not to mention a lower starting punishment range.",t2_gahgx,safhas,0,1649009170.0,0,t1_i390wpb,i390wpb,False,stopwastingmymoney1,t3_ttfsk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denton/comments/ttfsk2/man_found_guilty_of_shooting_denton_officer_in/,"Man Found Guilty of Shooting Denton Officer in the Head, Leg",/r/Denton/comments/ttfsk2/man_found_guilty_of_shooting_denton_officer_in/i390wpb/,1,r/Denton,0,1

- Something unexpected is found in the ground and must be dealt with, cleaned up, etc.
- A third party (Atmos, DME, TxDOT) takes a long time to do whatever they need to do for the project to continue.
- Sometimes a contractor goes bankrupt in the middle of a project (e.g. Teasley).
- Sometimes the weather conditions have to be right for installation of certain surfaces or road striping.
- Inflation or unexpected increases in construction costs can result in delay as the city or whoever has to find additional funding.
- A shortage of construction workers or supplies has been a bit of an issue lately from what I've heard.

"I have had a very similar past. I can appreciate how you are coming at this and you are right I am not here to pass judgment on people.

Getting them hormones to change their sexual identity is not on the top of that list for most foster kids. And yet here are so many people that think the most important thing I could do is agree with them. I’d wager not many would even do a fraction of what it takes to be a foster provider. Life is not black-and-white. Jesus wasn’t a white man. Gay people make great parents. Being a good person is not always about agreeing with everyone, and I have had to come to terms with that myself.

"Here’s the thing man, if you want to hate gay people I really don’t care. If you want to hate trans people, I really don’t care. I say both of these things as a gay man. I have literally nothing to prove to anyone but myself. I prove to myself everyday that I am worthy of all of the good things in life. I don’t need validation from others like so many people need nowadays. Personally, it amazes me more gays do not think along these same lines as you figure they would, being discriminated against and thrown out into the world on their own, that is. I was kicked out at 17. Mom was an addict when I was growing up and my dad was abusive. I was Laughed at. Lived under stairs during the winter for a few nights. Couch hopped. Today I manage a small business, all of my bills are paid, i have my own place, I have new shoes on my feet, and I have a roof over my head. Not one other living person on this earth helped me obtain any of those things. Certainly not the “LGBT” community either. They were too busy laughing at the “homeless, problematic gay” on one hand and using situations like mine to advance their own political agenda instead of helping on the other. So don’t let these folks belittle what you do to help people who were once like me. I have ZERO belief that you “hate” trans people and I know you would foster a trans *child* if that was what was necessary to remove them from physical harm. People just suck. These people criticizing you are probably so self-centered and self-focused they won’t ever *truly* help anyone else until the day they have a kid. Even that will be selfish at its core.

Edit: Touched up my grammar. Also wanted to add that after sharing this personal aspect of my life someone from “the firm” (ominous term borrowed from the British royal family to describe the LGBT PAC) chose to downvote my comment and send me a hate message instead of being happy I made it out alive. Thank you for reminding me why I feel the way I do. All because I chose to have a dialogue with someone they disagreed with. This is why I will continue to not stand with your shitty PAC and hypocritical worldview. Y’all really ain’t shit and need to get your priorities right. A lot of you guys really would prefer all of the gays to be homeless as long as they “toe-the-line”.

"Accurate summary.

I can only imagine the exasperation of the journalist as he sat there listening to Gerard rant about newspapers as opposed to, you know, actually suggesting anything productive.

Also, this quote:

Is pure gold. Didn’t Gerard just run for mayor barely a year ago? And didn’t he also have no specific experience prior to that? What made him more qualified to be a first-time mayor than Meltzer?

"Trinity II is an exhibit series that features the work of Chris Adams, James Flowers and Sam Ivie, who are all UNT alumni.  
  
Chris Adams is a professor at South Plains College in Levelland, where he teaches drawing, design and art appreciation courses to students. He is a graduate of the University of North Texas (BFA, 1998) and Texas Tech University (MFA, 2012). He works primarily in drawing, watercolor, printmaking and photography - utilizing still life and pop culture imagery in his work. He has most recently exhibited at the Buddy Holly Center in Lubbock (2022), the Faculty Show at South Plains College (2021) and the Charles Adams Studio Project in Lubbock (2019).  
  
James Flowers is a photographer who received his BFA from the University of North Texas in 1995. He creates composite images in a similar manner to artists such as Joseph Cornell, except that his arranged collages of found objects are meant to be viewed as photographs. These miniature images are intimate doorways to the unknown, memory, science and speculations on the afterlife. He most recently participated in Trinity: Chris Adams, James Flowers, Sam Ivie at the MCL Grand in Lewisville (2020) and in a solo exhibition titled The Nighttime Sky and Other Miscellany at UNT on the Square (2019).  
  
Sam Ivie received his BFA in painting and drawing from the University of North Texas in 1997. His work is a combination of invented imagery and portraiture which was most recently exhibited at the Bath House Cultural Center (2019-2020), the Patterson-Appleton Center (2019), Midland College (2019) and the MCL Grand Theater in Lewisville (2020). He works in graphite, ink, watercolor, colored pencil, acrylic and oils.  
  
The show runs from March 25th-April 16th, 2022. Please join us and meet the artists at the opening this Friday.

"It’s a great answer, IMO. I’m not a monster. I didn’t say harm trans people, I didn’t say deny them care, I just don’t agree that they need us to assimilate to their severe mental health condition. Severe body dysmorphia is a real thing and it’s very challenging for the people who have it and medical doctors have found that treating them would actually produce better outcomes than leaving them in the situation they are in. That is their choice. I’m happy for them to have that choice. But when they want to start forcing their lifestyle on the rest of society that’s when it becomes a problem. I do not need transsexuals entering a bathroom with children. I do not need transsexuals competing in sports with people of the (formerly) opposite sex. If they want to be trans that’s fine by me, but I don’t think our society should be focusing on giving trans people everything they want. I just don’t think fighting for trans rights should be centerstage, right now. You can paint me however you like but I’m pretty boring.

"You twisted my words I did not say that liberals cannot care about children and trans rights, but I would say one seems to get a lot more of the spotlight than the other. You say that you care about foster children, but here we are talking about trans people when there are over 400,00 foster children in America. Maybe you’re answering your own question. If you want me to answer it I would say that people tend to think they care about children, but ultimately do not care enough to do anything about their concerns. I think that’s why so many liberals cling to the trans rights movement. It’s such a small movement and you can actually see change. It’s an easier movement to get behind than 400,000 foster children, systemic racism, oppressive classism, and climate change… You get where I’m going with this?

"At what point will you realize that your friends treat trans people as less than people, and readily show it by making an effort toward hiding their existence from their kids? And why do you keep accusing me of treating someone as less than people? I just don't like associating with people who act like assholes. Big difference.

And hey, if I were to treat them as less than people, should I feel so bad when they cast the first stone (downward, I will add)? My trans friends would be pretty upset with me if I showed the same tacit approval that you do. Because tacit approval of people who actively exclude marginalized groups means you passively exclude those marginalized groups.

Please tell your friends in no uncertain terms that they need to accept trans folk, and that, no, knowing about their existence won't make them trans (as if it's even a bad thing, were they to turn out to be). Or, at least, that they need to stop aligning themselves with the movement to suppress trans rights, which is way more along the lines of ""not treating people like people"" than I will ever be. And do not accuse me of that one more time. You must understand that it's, at best, baseless, and, at worst, ironic and backwards.

"Plenty of people are and yes 15k after tax in my experience. Your definition says you want to buy a home in 2-3 years which is going to consume the most of your income. Truth is you’ll be paying over asking and 10k a month is not going to afford you that luxury. Lets say you pay 50k over asking you still have to consider closing costs, down payment, moving, furnishings, inspections. Money goes by quickly & Vacation budget is severely different per person but Im using 2 vacations annually as an example each costing 8k.

"I'm not offended.  I'm saying that is unprofessional behavior.  If an employee can't be relied on to show up to the first day of work and doesn't call to let you know that, no employer is going to want that person as an employee.  There's no point in calling at that point.

A lot of employers have reported issues these days with people agreeing to take a job and then ghosting them.  You also hear a lot of employees these days complaining about a lack of respect from employers. Respect and professionalism are two way streets.  You can't expect it if you aren't willing to give it.

Right now it is an employee's market.  There will come a time when it isn't.  These things go in cycles.

"Not gonna downvote you, but you're wrong bc you're massively underestimating the cost of replacing a human with a machine. A wage slave is cheaper than an automated solution, at the current economic and tech level.

I once worked on a machine that cost $250,000 to replace the work of one human, and the low skilled human labor still outperformed the robot 10 to 1 in terms of efficiency. The human cost 35,000 per year, while the machine requires service contracts and parts. We could hire 7 humans for the price of one machine, that's a 70:1 efficiency of humans over machines.
