"Yikes man. 
UPTOWN/DOWNTOWN: Stolen cars are anywhere and everywhere. There were like 3 parked in the downtown area just on my morning walk with my dog. Saw a rented or brand new bought BMW SUV bipped (windows broken &robbed) someone was living in it recently at least. A red BMW and a Whitt car. Police will leave totaled cars around and park their squad few blocks away and wait for someone to steal it if there’s multiple frequent thefts in the area….

THE WEST: there’s dumped cars everywhere out here. Just drive. 

THE EAST: just wait for the police to find it. There’s too many places. Someone is probably driving it there right now if your lucky. 

SAN LEANDRO: there’s lots of empty lots and warehouse to leave crime scenes and cars… also more people have houses and garages here to keep things. 

THE WHOLE BAY: cut losses. but if this is your life mission. I would check the easy places first like Berkeley and Emeryville. small,lots of people, easy to find something like that. 

Don’t drive too slow at a slow creep down the street, don’t look out with your windows down, don’t rubberneck too long, don’t be looking at night. You driving around looking for your stolen car in the streets can look bad in 100 different ways. Don’t get the car your driving in stolen during the process too.

"Add Flynn Investments to that list. They own over 30 medium to large apartment complexes in Adams Point and around Lake Merritt as well as over double that in SF. The construction and unabated noise they allow at their properties is ridiculous as it can go on for 9+months. This isn't retrofitting work for building safety, just renovations for units they're hoping to rent at crazy mark ups. A benefit to prolonged construction is that it usually causes tenants to move out due to noise. Which they can then rent again at higher rates. It's no secret that it's a tactic they use.

EDIT: I'd like to add that Flynn Investments almost exclusively uses Meridian Management Group in SF to manage their properties. They also donate a considerable amount of money to the CHA among other housing organizations in the state and local areas that they own properties in. A lot of these donations are done through property management companies or LLCs that are created for each property they buy.

If ever you've wondered why changes to zoning laws and better protections and rights for tenants have such a hard time getting created and enforced, it's because the landlords can lobby like crazy through donations.",t2_5yl3q,oblue87,0,1648927177.0,0,t1_i352zw9,i352zw9,True,redditisforpedossss,t3_tuk0ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/tuk0ya/hello_would_anybodys_be_interested_in/,hello would anybody's be interested in r/reportlandlords,/r/oakland/comments/tuk0ya/hello_would_anybodys_be_interested_in/i352zw9/,6,r/oakland,0,6

"Barber here. Not exactly how that works. 
The barber gets a percentage of that (usually50%). Add a tip to that ($5-$10) and you’re making $35-$45 per cut.  
You’re working 8 hours but you’re not doing 16 half hr cuts a day. Maybe 10 if you’re lucky so that makes you $350-$450 a day at $60 per cut. 

Now. Most barbers are charging $25-$45 on average. More quality places charge $40 so your making $25-$35 per cut. At 10 cuts that’s $350 max per day sometimes you do more, a lot of the time you do less. Take out self employment, state and federal taxes which is more than what salaries employees have to pay and you’re making $20-30 in the Bay Area.

"As everyone is saying: ""multiple thin layers (one of them a fleece), and be prepared for wide variation in temperature"".

I've been in the Bay Area a long time, and there are patterns that can help you understand the variations everyone talks about.  Even in these times of climate change, there are still major patterns that determine the microclimates that the Bay Area is famous for.

1. The cooler months are more predictable.  Basically, from October 31 through January 31, it will be darker, colder, and wetter, and almost never hot in any way.  Cold during that period can get down into the 30s at night, but most commonly into the 40s. In any case: very bad if you don't have any shelter, and if you do, then dress warm when out at night.
2. Once February hits, it can be surprisingly warm throughout the Bay Area.  March can be wet, but it hasn't been for decades.
3. Starting around end of March, early April, the Bay Area ""Fog Cycle"" starts to become a thing.  Here's what happens:
   1. the sun shines bright
   2. the ground warms up, especially in the INTERIOR of the state (THE CENTRAL VALLEY, which is the conjoined Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley, which, in totality is where a big percentage of the US food supply comes from).
   3. hot air rises
   4. which creates a vacuum
   5. and the Marine Air Layer along the coast gets sucked in through gaps in the Coastal Mountain Range.
   6. The Marine Layer is wet, and when it gets pulled in, several things happen:
      1. the suction causes the wet air to condense as it gets pulled in, and that's what causes Fog
      2. The Fog gets blocked by taller mountains, but it pours through gaps
   7. The MAJOR GAP is called ""The Golden Gate"" — this is literally the gap that is spanned by The Golden Gate Bridge.
   8. During Fog Influx Cycles — which typically vary from 2-5 days, the Fog — which is relatively cold air — runs fast and furious though the Gate and hits the target due East which is Berkeley.  
   9. Berkeley and Oakland are right next to one another.
   10. There are days in the summer when the Berkeley Campus is shrouded in gray fog, and almost chilly.
   11. Every 2-5 days, if you were to walk from the Berkeley Campus south, along Telegraph Boulevard in about 2.5 miles you'll be at the Oakland-Berkeley boundary, somewhere past Woolsey Street, and definitely by the time you're at 56th Street, Oakland.  At that point, you'll find a zone where you can literally walk from 62°F to 80°F in about five minutes.

There's more to all this, including the nuances of which parts of SF get cold and which ones stay warm during the Fog Cycle, and all kinds of details that have to do with exactly where the gaps in the Coastal Mountain Range allow the fog to flow east.  Petaluma, 40 miles northwest of Oakland has another big gap.

Oakland weather is actually some of the best weather in the Bay Area.  The East Bay from Albany to the north down to Alameda to the south is a belt of some of the most beautiful air in the US. It's air that has never disappointed me, and I've lived in some fucking bad air in my life.

"> Perhaps for a few, but there are many others who have weapons/guns too and have no problem using them on victims. So what happens when you get the thief who has nothing to lose and shoots back? 

We're already there, except *right now* the thieves *know for a fact* that their victims are unarmed.


> You want to get in a gun fight on the street over a $2k bag? 

Yes, property is worth more than a life. If I try to take from you, take *anything* from you, by force, threat or intimidation, you are 100% justified in cutting me down. I don't care if it's a stick of gum or a million dollars, in that situation *your property* is worth more than *my life.* That's a plain and simple fact.


> In this situation, if the victim pulled out a gun and shot them all he would probably have a legal issue on his hands because while a terrible, frightening situation, his life does not appear to be in immediate danger. 

His life doesn't need to be in danger, all he needs to do is *fear for his life* or for great bodily harm. That's it. No DA, even in SF or Oakland would prosecute this. He might et charged and then... the charges get quietly dropped. Remember the shopowner in Oakland Chinatown who fired at a theif who was mugging some lady? The OPD officers who responded were ready to cut him loose until brass showed up and *ordered them* to arrest the guy even though they objected. Of course he was booked and released and then... *charges were quietly dropped.*

> They dragged him around because he wouldn’t let go of his bag. Once he let go, they took off.

"…ok, you’re in that sort of mindset. Let me just say this: I have no respect for an occupying force of armed individuals who deem it acceptable to commit war crimes (using chemical weapons, firing at journalists and medics, launching less-lethal weapons at civilians when you’re supposed to aim them at the ground so that you DON’T hit people directly, just a few examples) against people who criticize them. There’s a reason those “riots” happened, but you’re too stuck in your “blue lives matter” shtick to understand. 

To be fair, policing is a tough job, and officers are expected to deal with a lot more than they’re trained to deal with or in any way prepared to handle (hence why funds should probably be allocated to other organizations that can fill in those gaps, instead of giving it to existing departments to use to buy freaking tanks). But a lot of people have tough jobs where lives are on the line, where they are forced to do far more than they should be expected to handle. And when they mess up, they usually face actual consequences, not paid vacations. It’s like defending a firefighter who doesn’t want to help someone who called him a prick. Is it wrong to say that’s a childish response  when your responsibilities are so significant? I’d say no but it sounds like you’d disagree. 

I don’t know how you can defend the police not doing their jobs bc people asked them to be held to a higher standard (on par with people who work customer service) and maybe be less trigger-happy and murderously vengeful to anyone who doesn’t give them the respect they think they deserve. But you can, apparently, and that’s concerning. And before you go off about ‘burning buildings’ this and ‘public nuisance’ that, the police response to the “riots” was wholly disproportionate, and any similarly-armed body of individuals would have faced much more severe consequences than many of them did. But you’ll see things as you want.

"It's the explicit job of the police to handle the ""criminals that run whole neighborhoods like they're fucking warlords"", not the residents. The resident's job is to articulate their needs to allow for a functioning civil society. Which, to me, includes the right to not have an officer shoot you or kneel on your neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds when you don't pose an immediate threat of seriously hurting or killing someone. Hence, if you are unwilling to do your job in either context, you are just out here showing your ass.


With regards to the 2020 protests, do you mean the OPD that illegally used tear gas on the students that marched from Oakland Tech to downtown to explicitly protest the violence that was happening? Or the OPD that let many businesses be looted saying it was unsafe for the officers to be out while pointing at the Federal Services officers who were shot as the reason while blaming said shootings on BLM protestors? Maybe if they had done their job that first night they would've caught  Steven Carrillo and Robert Justus, both right wing terrorists, before Carrillo had a chance to murder those Santa Cruz sheriff deputies...

"Yeah but, they also patrol Oakland. 

You can be the best cadet, straight as an arrow but, the people of this city will change you. 

Oakland is more of a reflection of its residents than one may care to admit. There’s a culture of taking pride in this being a dangerous place. In being able to survive “the streets”. Doing so is more of a defense mechanism than anything else. I know because I grew up here, I know what some people in the hood are like. Some are just poor and can’t live anywhere else, they cope with having to live around people who are openly against the forward progress of their community, people who sabotage the youth of the neighborhood, people that intimidate other and commit acts of violence. 

During the summer of 2020, how many demonstrations against police were there? Now tell me, how many demonstrations did we have against the criminals that run whole neighborhoods like they’re a fucking warlord?
Don’t get me wrong, OPD has a bunch of issues but, I think it’s clear that the real threat lives amongst us as private citizens

Every time I post calling out how shitty some people are in this city, I get a bunch of smart asses replying and downvotes. I’m expecting the same here because of my criticism towards the focus of BLM being lives lost at the hands of police and not including those we lose at the hands of criminals and the lives we lose to a toxic culture of glorification of violence and crime.",t2_a2z9tp1w,510dude,0,1648863162.0,0,t1_i323w7a,i323w7a,False,mvpeast,t3_ttq62j,https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/ttq62j/man_assaulted_and_his_lv_bag_stolen_in_oakland/,Man assaulted and his LV bag stolen in Oakland.,/r/oakland/comments/ttq62j/man_assaulted_and_his_lv_bag_stolen_in_oakland/i323w7a/,6,r/oakland,0,6

"We really need to figure out a better prison system. It’s not sustainable how we’re doing it now and the system has already cracked and is leaking badly. I think there should be way more “repaying your debt to society” type programs in prison and DEFINITELY way more rehabilitation programs. They get out and go back to crime because it’s what they know and it pays. So if rehab showed them more than crime and gave them more ways to get paid without crime, then I think we’d see a positive change there. 

The whole glorification of the hood/gangster life thing doesn’t help either, but that stuff is impossible to quash.

"Ain't that hard to get good.  Just need to learn how to raise a burr and hold a steady angle, really.  Good equipment and a little technique will yield amazing results.

Thing is, it takes 20-30 minutes on good whetstones to ""touch-up"" one of my knives.  Who knows how much work any given knife is going to take.  I sharpen for friends occasionally which usually entails completely resetting the bevel, sharpening, and then stropping, which can take an hour a or more.

Imagine what an hour of professional labor in the bay area is worth?  I'd pay that for sharpening service, but I'd be one of the few.  If someone were going to charge enough to do a proper job, they wouldn't have enough customers to keep 'em in business.

Would you look at that. Extrapolating from here, a reduction to your estimated decade ago rents (50% increase is a 33% decrease) would only require building 1.1% more housing! Obviously the relation isn’t actually linear, but the rhetorical point stands. What are these examples of cities with high vacancy and high housing prices? 😂

"I get it, but while ""an established family neighborhood not wanting...to change its character even more."" is understandable, it's also like the prototypical example of NIMBYISM. We can't maintain the character of established family neighborhoods and have enough housing in California. We have to choose between the two. 

I get it, because people will pay a premium for houses or apartments that are the perfect distance from population and commercial centers for their needs (balancing noise/traffic/cleanliness against shopping/nightlife and so on) and it's hard to accept it when you paid a premium to live in a less busy area and have quiet, peaceful, private space, and other people tell you you have to give all that up to make your neighborhood more like everywhere else. It's a really hard pill to swallow, and I don't think NIMBYs are universally selfish or shitty people.

But they are an obstacle to housing a greater percentage of the community at prices that leave them money for food and health care, and it's important to communicate that to them. I don't blame you (general, not personal you) for wishing your neighborhood could stay calm and quiet, but if you oppose denser housing in your neighborhood you ARE part of the problem, and you need to be aware of that.

It's hard. It sucks when places that felt more personal and like a closer knit community become more corporatized, and it's frustrating that it feels like we can't house enough people without doing that. I think cities in the Bay Area need to make some hard choices and come together to discuss how to improve housing density without necessarily fully giving over to developers and real-estate speculators. But if they're not going to have those conversations, then they at least need to allow more and denser housing, and other services. A bigger school is actually relevant to denser housing, even if it's a private school, if we assume that private schools have an appropriate place in the ecosystem of education in our city.

Police NEED to do their fucking jobs. I understand why they're unhappy,  and why they don't want to ( I work for one .... it's more toxic than yall think in here ), but still. You hold the badge and gun, and do right by the community, not yourself. 


Prosecutors need to fucking prosecute. Yall went to school for too long to let petty shit slide the way yall been doing it. The current system does t work, fine we know, but the DA office is 80% responsible for the sideshows / petty thefts getting as far out of hand as they have. 
You can't expect police to do any arrests when the prosecutor constantly drops those specific charges.  For crimes....the community needs to start putting more pressure on them. 

Politicians are to blame for the poverty that's driving these crimes. I don't know what they get out of it , but they fucking know damn well what they're doing .

"I mean, cops writing tickets in general is pretty silly. I would be surprised if a cop cited either person in this scenario, and had a collision occurred and damages been pursued the insurance companies (if any) would seek to minimize their clients liability.  


I got curious about how that scenario would shake down, and did a bit more research and found the lovely Bay Area Bicycle Law section on pedestrians yielding to cyclists: [https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/safety-laws/should-pedestrians-yield/](https://bayareabicyclelaw.com/safety-laws/should-pedestrians-yield/)  


If this particular scenario had resulted in a collision and litigation, it seems it would fall into the gray area of ""Common Sense"" with both parties bearing some ""comparative negligence."" Likely, prior rulings around VEH D11 C5 21953 and 21954  as well as prior rulings around collisions between vehicles and hearing impaired pedestrians.

That said, most of my prior comment is focused on the ""litigation prevention"" side of things. Cutting ""close enough"" to a pedestrian to prompt a shouting match isn't cool; not checking before stepping into a designated bike lane is also not cool.   
People accidentally do not cool stuff all the time. A lot of the not cool behaviors we engage in can be avoided by slowing down a touch.

  
TL/DR: I agree, citations shouldn't be issued for jaywalking or for using a bike lane a pedestrian walked into.

"There are ""options"" but they aren't often available to these youth the way they are to other people. I worked at a shelter for a few years and a lot of them don't have family they can turn to, and their social networks become super important to them. We had one kid (who was in one of the robbery circuits for awhile) set up to get into a live/work program - and they didn't want to go because the ""family"" they created wasn't going to be there.

We would often get them set up with job interviews and they wouldn't get the jobs because their lack of education or difficulty interviewing, or already have records. It wouldn't be long until they would stop trying or become really disheartened by it.

People look into what their communities are doing and how they are thriving and copy it. Our social programs are super fucked up and hard to navigate already, especially for young folks who don't know their way around a computer, or know where to go or who to ask. Like, I don't know what to do or how to fix it, but I know what is happening now isn't working - as you can see our houselessness situation is Oakland is growing at a saddening rate.

Also, a lot of the non-native groups would join gangs if they came here without family or jobs set up, or places to go. It's not uncommon at all.

"I grew up in the Bay Area, lived in Oakland for 7 years while working. It was not sustainable so I moved. Pushed out by extreme costs, and what do you get for paying that much? The cities are dirty and violent, people are tense individualist who are just looking out for themselves. That's great that silicon valley is there, but at what cost? Great for the 1%, but everyone else who are normal people suffer from people coming from all over the world with big pockets, able to pay inflated prices. I knew I'd never be able to buy a house where in the area I grew up, and it was sad to go, but I am much happier now with a better trajectory because of lower costs. 

We now live in a house in denver, 4 bedrooms, yard, basement for 2k a month. I was paying like 3,500 split with my gf for a 1 bedroom in oakland where someone was shot outside the building.

"> It seems to me that this term has lost any real meaning if we apply it to projects with zero ( or even negative) public benefit.

I get why this sounds appealing at first, but I think it falls apart in practice. The private, expensive homes also aren't providing any ""public benefit"", just like most privately owed land doesn't provide public benefit.

"We could!

So let's say you wanted to ""solve"" this by getting back to 130k inmates (though keep in mind there was a lot of crime in 2019 too), that would be $3 billion to construct more prisons and then $3b every single year to keep the extra 30k inmates locked up.  And there would still be crime.

"What's frustrating is that everyone is a victim at some level. The person who got looted. And, yes, even the looters. Income inequality or even perceived income inequality is a good motivator for crime. When the basics - food, shelter - are not consistently met, people will resort to stealing. It's their only chance at survival. And for many, survival is not merely enough. Contentment is subjective. Some need a lot more material items regularly to feel content. 

It's hopeless. Many poor people don't have a regular livelihood that pays enough for their material needs and they will resort to such quick schemes to get rich in the moment. Increasing police won't do squat, because the scales are terribly imbalanced. 

A systemic approach needs to happen, but that won't because people are unable to look at the whole picture and want to gut-react to the problems by offering gut-reactive solutions to the symptoms.",t2_iw4b2,SabashChandraBose,0,1648834621.0,0,t1_i30cbtp,i30cbtp,False,mvpeast,t3_ttq62j,https://www.reddit.com/r/oakland/comments/ttq62j/man_assaulted_and_his_lv_bag_stolen_in_oakland/,Man assaulted and his LV bag stolen in Oakland.,/r/oakland/comments/ttq62j/man_assaulted_and_his_lv_bag_stolen_in_oakland/i30cbtp/,-53,r/oakland,0,-53

"1. Society hasn’t normalized it, it’s a high end luxury item, nothing about it is supposed to be normal.

2. People can do whatever the fuck they want with their money

3. The fact that that’s all you’re focusing on here is a bit concerning.. an innocent man was brutally attacked by 2 complete strangers in broad daylight. He had his bag stolen, which had to hold his wallet and other important items. Not taken out of his car, stolen directly off of his body. I can’t even imagine the kind of trauma this must cause. 

4. This would’ve happened even if his bag was from Target. Sometimes the perps just want the goods inside, other times they want the bag + goods.

5. Now this poor man has to file a police report in a city that probably won’t follow up on it. The perps could now have the ability to charge up his credit cards, open new ones, and completely damage his credit. Even if you report your identity stolen, it takes YEARS (sometimes 7!!) for your credit score to go back to normal. 7 years where that victim wouldn’t be able to move, buy a car, or have the flexibility to make any big financial decisions.

We incarcerate 0.55% of our population, above the national average of 0.50%  and our prisons constantly hover at around 135% capacity, with some individual lock ups going higher.  

The second highest incarceration rate in the world is China, officially at 0.12%.  Frankly, they're lying.  Including pre-trial detainees, ""administrative"" detainees, and about a million Uyhgars, you get to almost 0.24%.  Yet this is still less than half of California's rate.

You can't say that we can't run a society without locking up so many people. Literally every other nation in the world makes it work.  Either were locking up the wrong people, incarceration people for too long, our lack of a social safety net has driven more people to crime, or all three.  Building more prisons or packing people in even tighter--which the state supreme court ruled to be cruel and unusually punishment--can only ever be a Band-Aid.

Probably because you parroted a countlessly debunked right wing talking point aimed at closet racists. Then after someone directly debunked it with a primary source again, you proceed to repeat it. It honestly doesn't matter what your political party is, if you have worms for brains.

"I agree with you that shouting matches are stupid and it's great you want to apologize. This guy is also 100% in the wrong. I'm deaf in one ear and 1. I've never had this issue for a visual issue like crossing the street 2. He wasn't crossing at a sidewalk. When you jaywalk (which I do ALL the time) you have to remember YOU are the one liable. 

Similar thought (and you're not gonna like this) but it sounds like you're biking a little recklessly. As you said no one cares about bikes and if you're biking in a city like Oakland, SF, or New York you *have* to imagine you're invisible. When I ride close enough to the parked car doors I am always scanning cars about 5-8 ahead of me to see if anyone is i the driver's side. I know that most people driving will speed extra fast through yellows (and early reds) and wait for that last surge before biking across. 

Not saying you don't do those things but that's three near hits in one day. Were the others guys assholes? Assuredly. Doesn't getting angry about them save your life next time?

"I don’t know if I’d call BART a treasure, but it’s definitely good at moving people from point A to point B in an environmentally friendly manor. Plus no traffic is great too. 

As expected there are a lot of “BaRt BaD” comments on here, and they do hold some merit. Bart in the early 10’s with those cloth seats could be pretty gnarly at times. That said it’s improved a massive amount and many of the issues people are mentioning on here seem to be issues that happened a while ago. Sure there will still be a homeless man conked out on two seats, but let’s be real public transportation so for the public and not the “elite”. There are definitely some sheltered folks in the comments who have clearly never been on trains in New York, Chicago, hell even London can get musky as hell.

"My brother lives in the Sacramento area. He came to go to a Raider game with me one Sunday. We usually drove and tailgated, but this day we took BART. 

I brought a 12 pack and a flask of whiskey. We got on at the start of a line. 

I offer him a beer. He thought I was crazy. I cracked my beer and just started drinking. He was visibly concerned and kept saying O was gonna get arrested.

The next line, a ton of Raider fans got on. There some dudes that sat down on those seats across from us (you know the section of the train where seats face each other), and pulled out their tequila. I gave them a cheers. 

My brother looks at me, smiles, starts drinking tequila with them. The train is packed with Raider fans. 

My brother and I drank heavily on the way to BART, at the game, and when we got back safely and didn’t even have to think about driving, he’s like “you have no idea how lucky you are. BART is great!!!”

I’m like, “I know exactly how lucky I am. That’s why I live here”.
