1) continue to try to make progress on subsidized housing, especially for women with children, the disabled and people that are working to improve their lives. know that it will always be a tiny fraction of the perceived need.

"My observed answer as a very non-expert is that it likely has to do with Santa Cruz's geography. We have a ton of pinch points that funnel all road traffic (and bike traffic) along a handful of routes. There doesn't seem to be a great way to extricate bus routes from the already bad traffic in town. 

I think that Santa Cruz also has an extremely high traffic population for it's size. On top of the regular traffic from residents, there is a ton of pass through traffic that is just trying to get across town (such as from highway 17 down to south county) and tourism traffic that contribute a lot of cars to the road. 

If you look at trying to get from the bus station hub to somewhere like soquel or aptos you really only have a few options to get across town. To get to the harbor/Arana you have hwy1, water, soquel, and e cliff/Murray. You could also jump on Broadway but you'll be forced over to soquel or Murray.
To get passed Arana gulch you get pinched down to only three options (unless you are snaking through the prospect heights neogborhood which isn't very efficient either and just reconnects you with soquel). You have to be on hwy 1, soquel, or Murray to get through. Even once you get passed Arana gulch to get passed Rodeo you still only have a few options: 1, soquel, capitola, brommer, Portola etc. Then to get through Capitola your only options are soquel, highway 1, or taking cliff drive straight through downtown capitola.

When you take a step out and look at getting fully across Santa Cruz you really only have some variation on three options: Soquel, the Highway, or coastal. Once those three options are jammed up, busses are going to be as bogged down as every other car. 

Dedicated bus lanes could help but they really don't have much physical room. I think they could make it work but it would take a lot of will to push it through",t2_z4gq7,cheapseats91,0,1649001035.0,0,t1_i38h58l,i38h58l,False,Ok-Machine4361,t3_tunhfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/santacruz/comments/tunhfq/enough_greenway_spam_no_way_greenway_greenway_is/,"Enough Greenway Spam, No Way Greenway.

"All of those places have a high enough density to warrant regular service from Santa Cruz to Watsonville. Here’s a quote from the study done by our actual real transit planners on that: Santa Cruz Branch Rail Transit Feasibility Study -- Final ReportDecember 2015 Excerpt from page iii: 
""The county’s population density is one of the highest in California, with approximately 90,000 people living within one-half mile of the rail line. Areas along the rail line have population densities similar to Berkeley/Oakland and cities along the San Francisco Bay Peninsula. The number of people per square mile in the City of Santa Cruz and the Seacliff area are approximately 4,000; Live Oak ranges from 5,300 to 7,100 people/square mile, and the City of Watsonville has over 7,500 people/square mile. 2""  (footnote 2: quickfacts (dot) census (dot) gov)

"Enough do work from home, however. Light rail in order to work has to have pretty significant ridership.

We also don't know if gas will get to 7 a gallon or stay there. Gas prices have spiked before.

You don't need to buy a 30k electric cars you can get them cheaper and there are even extra credits for lower income people. The average new car price in the U.S today is already over 47,000.

I guess my point is that in order for this to work it has to be better than driving, and that's really hard to do in low density suburbia. Do I drive a car and sit in traffic for 45 minutes or do I walk 20 minutes to a bus stop, take a 30 minute bus, get on the light rail for 30 minutes take another 30 minute bus and then walk another 20 minutes? That is the big issue to tackle.

"Maybe, but I believe there are rumblings of medium/high density housing at the old par 3, especially with the new state laws. 

Also, this brings up an interesting issue - how much demand will there be in the future for light rail? Remote work has caused demand for public transit to go down quite a bit in many places. Do we really want park and ride at all or do we want to focus on long term development with no cars?

I think I might rather see all those areas instead receive high density transit village developments if light rail winds up getting built.

"I have answers for you! 1. Why not just fund buses more? Because buses sit in traffic and we have a rail line! The RTC did a study and found it’s actually cheaper to upgrade and add light rail to our transportation system. This is because light rail is cheaper to operate then buses, and runs faster (because no traffic) and so gets more ridership. ALSO bonus, adding light rail as a component actually improves METRO’s funding situation and ridership so much that you start getting the synergy needed to improve the entire system. 2. But I want a trail because rail might be far in the future. Guess what?! The trails already being built now! It’s called the Coastal Rail Trail, and not only is it being built already, but Greenways plan actually causes all the current planning and construction to stop, and have to start over, costing us MORE time and money.

"Why befriend a latino kid who goes to your school when you can take a trip to Mexico with you christian church youth group?!

Being ghosted was my childs experience in her so called friend group at SVHS. Another friend left the school after coming out & being ghosted & bullied by his football team. 

My kid had a 504 plan to help with testing for anxiety issues. No one took it seriously. I mean, I understand, so many students with ""real"" issues to deal with. But it ended up as a diagnosed  heart issue that was causing anxiety like issues making it difficult to take test or do public speaking. This kid had diagnosed mental health issues.

The district provided great academic prep for college but failed with the social structure being geared for the super smart, rich, white & entitled.

I was told by many people not to enroll in the SV district because of these problems and deeply regret that we didn't do the drive to Santa Cruz.

If you look at the city goverment staff you will see the lack of diversity. Same with people running city hall. As a brown skin human, I know when I've walked into an non diverse environment. SV fits that bill.

"I used to live in the Seacliff apartment ghetto on the edge of the former coastal meadow that is now home to condos, a playground, skateboard park and Episcopal church.

Every Sunday afternoon after the 49er game we'd take very well-lubricated golf swings aimed at the 9 hole par-3 golf course across the freeway. Eventually we added to the realism by using some leftover sod to build a beautiful elevated tee box, and horseshoe pits. 

It was considered a pretty good drive if you could reach the frontage road where it arcs at the dummy curve/offramp/chain link fence.

Only one ""golfer"" ever reached the actual golf course, on a couple of very high hops, 300+ yards over the frontage road and four lanes of Highway 1 traffic. We found it difficult to really enjoy the history-making golf shot because we were all running away, doubled over with laughter.

Ok, so I actually had been planning on it, until I found out they didn't deliver. The airbnb we stayed in....we had a weird interaction with the host. So the hosts husband was cool and we chatted in the evenings the first 2 nights. He specifically told me that he was her husband. The 2nd night the host comes out and I say ""hey, its been really nice chatting with your husband."" She's like ""MY WHAT?!"". Turns out, the dude had left for 18 months, and was now just the boyfriend and slowly getting back in her good graces. She was pissed he'd called himself that. So they go inside and argue, and I ignore it. Then a few days later dude knocks on the door and asks me to help him push his harley out of a shed in the back yard, she was kicking him out and he had to get all his stuff off the property before she got back. Never heard or saw her after the 2nd night. So after I push the dudes bike out for him, he offers to buy us dinner at the Red Pearl, but I felt weird about taking him up on it, all I did was take 5 minutes to help him get his bike through a doorway.

"I applied for a position with Public Works in 2019 and never heard more back from personnel than “we’ve received your application” and zero information about the selection process.  While posted as open to new hires and promotional, I later heard, whether truth or rumor that there was no intention to hire outside applicants.

Last year I was hired by another county department.  Application was submitted in August; actual start date wasn’t until December.  There was a strange test of sorts in scheduling an interview appointment.  I received an email from personnel instructing me to call a number that I knew to be an extension of the department phone tree immediately upon receipt of the email. This was late on a Sunday, and the next day was a holiday.  I left a voice message Tuesday morning and got called back Friday at 6:00 in the evening to schedule an interview.  Turns out nobody answers that phone extension, it always goes to voicemail.",t2_7h4dyun7,Jaded_Tank_8869,0,1648788944.0,0,t1_i2y2tf8,i2y2tf8,True,Caswell19,t3_tqoyjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/santacruz/comments/tqoyjg/applying_to_county_jobs/,Applying to County jobs,/r/santacruz/comments/tqoyjg/applying_to_county_jobs/i2y2tf8/,1,r/santacruz,0,1

>The analysis of rent control is among the best-understood issues in all of economics, and -- among economists, anyway -- one of the least controversial. In 1992 a poll of the American Economic Association found 93 percent of its members agreeing that ''a ceiling on rents reduces the quality and quantity of housing.'' Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand. Sky-high rents on uncontrolled apartments, because desperate renters have nowhere to go -- and the absence of new apartment construction, despite those high rents, because landlords fear that controls will be extended? Predictable. Bitter relations between tenants and landlords, with an arms race between ever-more ingenious strategies to force tenants out -- what yesterday's article oddly described as ''free-market horror stories'' -- and constantly proliferating regulations designed to block those strategies?

"The work from home crowd totally blew up the less-legal trails during the pandemic. 

The parking areas are full of Google and Apple employees at 2pm on a Tuesday, all chasing the same empty trails that no longer exist because everyone had the same idea to take a 4 hour lunch and drive to Santa Cruz with their eBike. 

Anyway… yeah… Demo. Braille (trail) is steep as hell. Cool place. The ruggedness and eBike ban still keeps the crowds thin.

UC is more “accessible,” and wild in a weird sort of unregulated way. But I think the actual trails in Demo are of better quality because they were created legally by a huge club with funding and education on how to build really nice trails. The UC trails can be super fun, but they don’t flow as nicely. You’ll find yourself peddling mid trail more often or asking yourself, “okay, now what!?” Where as at Demo, once your bike is pointed downhill, you could conceivably not even crank the pedals for 15 minutes. It’s a full on ride to the bottom.

The illegal trains in Nicene are not as nice as the US. Like sure, you can ride them and have fun in the woods. But the corners are banked wrong, they’re sometimes very loose, or just peter off into nothingness.

"I don't think our dip will be as substantial as many other places. The combination of scant available space to develop new housing, proximity to the beach/forests/Silicon Valley, and the constant market of renters from the University buffer us.  


In regards to OP's comment of ""some people who bought at the height (2005-06) didn’t see their homes return to the same value until quite recently.""?  I think that ""some"" is the truth.  Some probably did take that long, but I doubt most did. And, the housing collapse was 2007, not 2005. It was booming in 2005.  


My timeline as an example of a different reality:  
Bought in 2004.  
Worth 25% more than purchase price in 2006.  
Crashed in 2007. My value was only about 66% of my purchase price, or half what it was in 2006.  
Came back steadily. Back at the same value as purchase by about 2011 or 12.  
Current value today is  more than double what we bought for.

">that only happened because of overly lax lending that was letting people buy houses they were in no position to buy

https://www.nber.org/digest/aug15/us-foreclosure-crisis-was-not-just-subprime-event

While it is true that the subprime market and the foolishness around repackaging them and selling the trash to AIG triggered it all, the crash was not entirely in the subprime sector.

>The researchers find that the crisis was not solely, or even primarily, a subprime sector event. It began that way, but quickly expanded into a much broader phenomenon dominated by prime borrowers' loss of homes. There were only seven quarters, all concentrated at the beginning of the housing market bust, when more homes were lost by subprime than by prime borrowers. In this period 39,094 more subprime than prime borrowers lost their homes. This small difference was reversed by the beginning of 2009. Between 2009 and 2012, 656,003 more prime than subprime borrowers lost their homes. Twice as many prime borrowers as subprime borrowers lost their homes over the full sample period.

>The authors suggest that one reason for this pattern is that the number of prime borrowers dwarfs that of subprime borrowers and the other borrower/owner categories they consider. The prime borrower share averages around 60 percent and did not decline during the housing boom. Although the subprime borrower share nearly doubled during the boom, it peaked at just over 20 percent of the market. Subprime's increasing share came at the expense of the FHA/VA-insured sector, not the prime sector.

>The authors' key empirical finding is that negative equity conditions can explain virtually all of the difference in foreclosure and short sale outcomes of prime borrowers compared to all cash owners. Negative equity also accounts for approximately two-thirds of the variation in subprime borrower distress. Both are true on average, over time, and across metropolitan areas.",t2_a1s2le94,boomerbill69,0,1648760376.0,0,t1_i2wcp45,i2wcp45,False,DistrictFlashy3286,t3_tt6uq0,https://www.reddit.com/r/santacruz/comments/tt6uq0/economists_and_the_fed_are_now_predicting_a/,Economists and the fed are now predicting a housing bubble.

"Are these the same economists that thought inflation was not going to happen, and then when it did happen they predicted it was ""transitory?"" 

Economists are often wrong.  

Something to think about, all of the people who got VERY low interest rates in the past few years are not going to be rushing to sell their houses and increase their interest rates.  We are going to see interest rates in the 7% range soon with the feds increasing their base points.   If someone has an interest rate of 2.5% they are not going to sell and get a new mortgage with a 7% rate.  There will be fewer houses on the market due to the low pervious rates, and this will counter the lower purchases by people not able to afford the lower rates.

"The argument isn’t that the causes of the bubbles are the same. This is distinct from 2008. Also this isn’t about the “crisis” as in housing shortage, is about overinflated prices.

The reason there’s a bubble now is because of irrational exuberance and FOMO raising prices above what the market fundamentals would dictate. And the super low interest rates artificially kept borrowing cheap which added fuel to it. We’re due for a correction the question is really when/how not if.

This isn’t me arguing this, it’s professional economists whose job is to study these things.

UCSC trails provide maximum steep dh for climbing earned ratio. Typically you do little 600ft - 900ft descents in laps, there are options to shuttle this as well.
All of it is illegal and poorly regulated, so you might find it confusing to find so many people riding clearly illegal trails. None of the good trails are labeled. 

Soquel Demo forest is the Bay Area’s local bike park. It’s free and the trails are legal and maintained by the local bike advocate group.

"I know everybody else is saying that you'll have no issues with SMOG, but my experience is the opposite. Recently moved from out of state to Santa Cruz. Both cars had their cats checked when they were smogged. Any shop smogging a car is REQUIRED to check the code imprinted on the cat and run it through an online system to ensure that it is CA compliant. You may not see them do it at a shop (or they may not do it, if they are skimping on their job), but it is required.

Both our cars had aftermarket cats (one had original stolen in Seattle, other had original rust out). Even though both aftermarket cats were full legal, the process was a PITA overall. Involved taking both vehicles to the Smog ""referee"" in Monterey, a process which took 1-2 months for both cars. I would HIGHLY recommend making sure that whatever cat you put on your car is CA compliant. Otherwise you will have dumped ~$800 in to a worthless cat (if you get caught). And remember - just because you don't get caught this time, doesn't mean it won't happen the next smog test.

"Dirty... the county gives various members of the community in need (homeless for the most part) membership there because it's a way for them to have access to exercise (more importantly, showers). 

If 24 hour gym access/ multiple gym access while traveling is something you're looking for, it's good. I quit my membership during pandemic. I recently heard they filed for bankruptcy and as a result most clubs aren't 24 hours anymore and have posted hours. 

Toadal fitness is really good if you're looking for something low-key, don't have to worry about people being judgemental, most people won't be on roids, people will clean up their area after use. I left Toadal to join 24 because my new job had my working various hours and I needed access to the gym at random hours at night, as well as traveling for vacation. The downtown location you were about to access 24hrs with your Gym ID, but sometimes the system would bug and not unlock even if it scanned ultimately wasting your time. 

Santa Cruz power fitness (SCPF) is goodIf you want something more ""Hardcore"". People definitely use there, they have IFBB pros and professional body builders working out there constantly. Much more social media driven, the owners are cool (husband and wife) and Camille competes still I believe. 
That kind of environment can either scare/motivate you, but the machines are 1000% better at power fitness if up to date workout machines is something that factors in your decision. Toadal machines are a bit outdated in comparison (5-10yrs +).

"**[Railbanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railbanking)** 
 
 >Railbanking is preserving railroad rights-of-way for possible future use. Railbanking leaves the tracks, bridges, and other infrastructure intact, relieving the railroad operating company from responsibility of maintenance and taxation. Often the tracks are put in custody of a state transportation agency, which then seeks a new operator for possible rehab or reactivation. This helps ensure the possibility of future restored rail service when new economic conditions may warrant resuming operation.

If you can make rent go talk to Bay federal about first time homebuyer programs, they will help people pull all the things together, it's a grind for sure, but it sure as shit beats renting any day of the week. 7 years ago we poured everything we had into our first home purchase, and over those 7 years we've seen security that we would never have had renting. 

I will happily share any useful knowledge and experience to help others make that jump over the chasm from renting to owning. IF you want to live here long term it's the best way to build security. 

Sure, it means sacrificing some luxuries, like, not buying a new car for a decade, and maybe not having the vacations we might have wanted (we still had a couple nice trips) but so so worth it.",t2_7lwlp,thescottishguy,0,1648662116.0,0,t1_i2qozre,i2qozre,False,waitinfornothing,t3_tra561,https://www.reddit.com/r/santacruz/comments/tra561/are_there_limits_to_rent_increase/,Are there limits to rent increase?,/r/santacruz/comments/tra561/are_there_limits_to_rent_increase/i2qozre/,3,r/santacruz,0,3

"The 2 1/2 mile for just segment 8 is going to cost at least $32,000,000 to construct. The county only has collected about 31% of the money required to build it due to the cost. The extensive excavation and 30+ft retaining walls make this all to maintain a railroad track that has not seen passenger travel in over 60 years and there is nothing beyond a planning document is making the costs so high. The current plan  would see a train coming back in no less than 25 years and a $1,200,000,000 in costs, for that, we have $0 collected and a very limited possibility of getting those funds from the state or federal without further taxes from Santa Cruz residents. 

Measure D is a sensible solution that would rail bank the corridor, build a trail that only costs $2-$3 million per mile and could be completed in under 5 years. It protects the coridor at a federal level, there really is no reason to keep the 100 year old plus rusted tracks that cannot support passenger travel as even if we do decide and get funding for passenger rail, the tracks would require upgrading and re-configuring to support such use. 

It's time to stop holding the corridor hostage. We can easily build something similar to the rec trail that Monterey has enjoyed for decades where 2 million visitors use annually, including 70% of Monterey residents on a weekly basis.

"Well for a condo or a small home in Watsonville / SLV, you might sneak in closer to $600k. 

When I bought my house, I just bit the bullet and bought a super duper MFing fixer upper on a ghetto ass street. That’s what I had to do to make it work. 

Then rent out a room or have your partner pay half. 

You only need 3.5% down for your first home with an FHA loan. 

The way I competed with the cash buyers was by seriously looking at about 30 homes and probably bidding on 10+. 

It requires some serious stubbornness. 

I came up with my 3.5% downpayment and a little extra for closing costs and renovations by tossing whatever I could at the stock market every paycheck for maybe 4-5 years. I didn’t go out, drink (not even at home), go on a single vacation, buy clothes, etc in those 4-5 years. Also no car payment. I bought crappy clapped out cars and fixed them up. Think of every time you drop $40 on food or a new t-shirt and just put it into the stock market or crypto instead and sit tight. Adopt a really simple life. 

I’m not saying it was easy. It actually kind of sucked. But it was worth it. 

It’s not impossible. It’s just a matter of how much suck you’re willing to endure. I mean you are talking to someone who is a homeowner and who has also used EBT and WIC to get by. 

Being poor teaches you how to get rich in this weird round about way that I think a lot of people miss out on because they want to have their cake and eat it too.

"My family and I get a lot of racist ass encounters when we’re in Aptos/Capitola/Santa Cruz (usually caucasian women - sometimes men). Sometimes it’s verbal, other times it’s passive aggressive like blocking a cafe door when we are clearly about to walk in (perhaps they think there’s no way we buy $10 coffee?)

I typically ignore them but if I say anything, I often just remind them in a subtle but stern tone that they have no idea who we are and that it’s a bad idea to harass random strangers. The gist being that, I might be one of those strangers whom you don’t want to harass. 

Whether it’s blatant racism or just unprovoked harassment, I find that there’s a lot of frickin’ loud mouths around here. They assume nothing will ever happen to them. 

Try talking to strangers like that in Watsonville or Salinas and see what’s up. 

That said, this dude sounds mental. I dunno what to do there. Perhaps alert staff that there’s a racist a-hole preventing their customers from spending money.  

With mentally ill folks, I just try to be nice but also stay the hell away. Create distance. 
Keep an eye on their hands as as aggressions rise. 
Fight like an animal if attacked - hopefully you never have to. 

And regulate if you see someone else experiencing a problem like this. People of all colors need to back each other up when they see someone being harassed in public.

"I live at the California street house and have lived here through the construction. It has been a fucking nightmare. We had no path to our house in back for six months. There were trenches dug with rebar sticking out of the ground, piles of mud and equipment everywhere. It was dangerous and a pain in the fucking ass leaving or walking to my front door. 
 They tore down our laundry room so we got to trek through the debris and mud to get out of the house, to the street where there is limited parking, to do laundry at the laundromat. 

They did a lot more stuff that was not only illegal but just fucking stupid. Too much to list here because I will go on a rant. 

I can post photos if anyone wants to see how fucked it is. 


After seven months they built us a path. Now we have six new bedrooms in our driveway, zero privacy, no parking, no laundry anymore, and the yard we spent a year working on now is going to be shared with a stranger who moves essentially into our yard. 

Villa construction who is building these ADUs has zero communication between the different construction groups (solar, plumbers, etc) they literally don’t know what’s going on. 

Sure it is more housing but it has been done with no thought whatsoever aside from getting more money. They took up every inch of space possible and it all looks like shit. Not to mention that they rented out the two houses that were vacant at the beginning of construction for 4k each. There is no way a “normal” person is going to be able to rent these. They will be expensive as shit… and who wants to live in a creepy bright white college-dorm compound?

This is just greedy and fucked. Oh no, a renter complaining about more housing!!! Get fucked. Fuck you. It’s hard enough finding a place to live in this town.. after years I thought I finally got the house that I can stay in for a long time. We spent hundreds of hours improving the yard and making it a nice place. Not anymore. This has been soul crushing. We have been paying rent the entire time while the constant noise and construction workers surrounding us continue on 6 days a week. It sucks.

"No, not “good for me.” I didn’t do it. I was “simply” in the right place at the right time, and grateful that I was. 

For every high-profile, dangerous individual like the one you describe, there are dozens more low-profile, folks out of your line of sight (or you see them every day and aren’t aware they are homeless) while they work one or two jobs, sleep, and jump through whatever bureaucratic hoops are thrown at them to become housed again.

You are the one making excuses - excuses for punishing those who’ve made enough bad choices that they are no longer capable of making any choices at all by leaving them on the street to continue behaving as you’ve described until they drop dead.

Yes, they need to be somewhere off the streets. They are a danger to themselves and everyone they come in contact with. They are no longer able to do it  themselves. Someone has to facilitate that.
