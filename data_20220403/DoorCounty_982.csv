">what about compared to our average yearly gains excluding that year?

The stagnation (by inflation-adjusted GDP) is still there even comparing the 2019 figures over the previous several decades. The Great Recession forced a serious decline which hasn't been overcome. For the [2019 figures, this is an older version of the same link I posted earlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Economy_of_Door_County,_Wisconsin&oldid=1058725482#Tourism). Arts, entertainment, and recreation peaked in 2007, while accommodation and food services peaked in 2004. Symbolizing this, the [interior decor of the Target in Sturgeon Bay corresponds to that era](https://www.reddit.com/r/Target/comments/mjiylc/fyi_the_sturgeon_bay_wi_store_is_stuck_in_the/). It makes sense that a large corporation chose not to spend unnecessary money at a location which it doesn't expect to grow.

It isn't that tourists don't come, they do, but overall they don't spend enough to support wages where they need to be. Elites which the county needs to attract (they fund good jobs) tend not to travel to the county. The room tax raise from 5.5% to 8% this year is an acknowledgement that the current tourist economy is not doing well. Although I disagree with the hike, at least they are trying something different rather than pretending everything is hunky-dory.

>a county wide solar program

The [facebook group buy](https://www.facebook.com/doorcountysolar/) is a start. Plus Egg Harbor and its [SolSmart designation](https://www.villageofeggharbor.org/solar).

>I suggest switching to all electric energy

That would really put a dent in air pollution, and environmental quality in turn would facilitate continued development.

>a long term solution without losing many of them

Owners might leave, but the properties aren't going anywhere. The real estate market already has its own instability; some communities buy up existing houses to rent out as an affordable housing program. In a serious crash situation the county could do that too.

>is a more efficient use of our acres

Improving commercial lodging occupancy is especially more efficient given that there are existing vacant rooms which could be occupied. Labor shortages hamstring lodging providers because they end up not getting dirty rooms turned around right away.

>They need security from random shifts in the market and an easy means of expanding.

Farmers did better in 2020 than in 2019. Because agricultural markets do their own thing independently of the economic cycle, the decline in agriculture has made the overall county economy less stable. This alone should motivate others to support agriculture.

>a large share of small businesses is more resilient

Its a trade-off. You can have a bunch of resilient, though less efficient small businesses, or you can have fewer efficient, though less resilient large businesses. It was really damaging for the state to go around shutting down smaller food processors in the later 20th century to protect the environment. But just as it is possible to rig the rules in the wrong way to shut down the little guy, it is also possible to write codes and statutes which reward resiliency.

>offshore wind farm industry

This is sort of like oil, where there is a risk to shoreline property values. Affected property owners wouldn't give up, they'd [fight it like in Kewaunee County until the wind farm closes](https://fox11online.com/news/local/wind-energy-facility-in-kewaunee-county-no-longer-in-operation-will-be-gone-by-2019). And if you go far enough away from shore so they can't be seen, its too deep.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife would want a say (because of bird kills) given their nesting islands. Yet the feds broke their word to county residents, and [even to Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hog_Island_(Wisconsin)#House_hearing)  when they decided not to let people onto the islands at any time of the year. The islands could be used as destinations for snowmobilers and also for winter geocaching without affecting the nests.

>I agree that fighting our brain drain should be a top priority

I think we agree about a lot of things, and so do many others. A difficulty is that the opinions at the local government level don't quite match the population. Its the same basic thing which made the county board block the development of Whitefish Bay State Park, while a referendum approved it the first time around. Possibly referendums will be necessary to make things happen again.",t2_cgz5a6ue,ThrowAway943533,0,1648316826.0,0,t1_i27t4v0,i27t4v0,False,ThrowAway943533,t3_to2rq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/to2rq2/diana_wallaces_great_idea_for_the_housing_problem/,Diana Wallace's great idea for the housing problem,/r/DoorCounty/comments/to2rq2/diana_wallaces_great_idea_for_the_housing_problem/i27t4v0/,2,r/DoorCounty,0,2
"Half the decline from the year we had a multi week quarantine and deadly global pandemic, what about compared to our average yearly gains excluding that year? But even then an offshore wind farm, a county wide solar program or a public hospital could offset that loss both in advertising and in retaining dollars. An offshore wind farm industry could take advantage of our existing marine manufacturing infrastructure. 

I know I said I want energy independence, but I absolutely am against any new drilling. I suggest switching to all electric energy, including cars and heating.

Out of county property owners are a primary driver  of housing costs, I don’t see how we come up with a long term solution without losing many of them. I know that they have been a traditional source of income for the county, but our limiting resource is space and concentrating tourism housing into smaller areas like resorts and multi-floor hotel is a more efficient use of our acres.

We need subsidies for farmers supplying the local economy. They need security from random shifts in the market and an easy means of expanding. 

 A manufacturing job is usually a good long term job, but I mean just look at the rust belt! An  economy less reliant on imports could provide a market that’s competitive and innovative. A market with a large share of small businesses is more resilient and more beneficial than having a few large corporations.

">This can help but it’s not nearly enough money to help the people already living here

I wonder about this, too; Wallace's proposal is only 5% which may not be enough depending on the scale of the plans yet to be drawn up. If you count it as cost-per-head, it is cheaper to retain your area's existing young adults than to recruit new outsiders. This is because new arrivals are highly mobile, probably lack existing social supports, and may leave. So the subsidies would go farther with holding onto existing workers. As for competition with short-term rentals, this can be reduced with various fees and regulations.

With depressing tourism numbers, a previous estimate I made was that if the entire tax-generated portion of the Destination Door County budget was shifted to tangible municipal development, the hit to the tourist-dependent economy would be about half of the decline seen during the 2020 season. Wallace's proposal 5% is much less and might not even be noticed if inefficiencies were curtailed.

>residents less and less accommodating to tourists and the tourism industry

This depends on which residents we are thinking of. Out-of-area property owners and seasonal residents generally benefit from a flat or declining tourism industry, while business owners and their employees benefit from a growing industry. There are many former resort communities in the United States which once were into tourism until the cottage owners and similar types took over.

Historically, out-of-area property owners had the most to lose from an expanded tourist market. This was due to the DNR's use of condemnation to get land for state parks. Negative reactions many decades ago with Newport, Whitefish Bay, and Grand Traverse Island State Parks come to mind with this. For business owners, the parks are good for the economy, but they came at a cost to out-of-area property owners. The days when Hjalmar Holand kindly gave up his cabin to make way for Peninsula State Park are over. Instead there were unhappy fights in the 60s and 70s.

>if it became energy independent? Even if only 50% of our energy means were met with county

There is oil in the county's portion of Lake Michigan which is currently locked up due to a federal ban on new drilling under the Great Lakes. I ran the numbers: the value of the estimated recoverable oil is only 1/10 of the assessed value of the residential properties. With contaminants and accidents it doesn't make sense to risk residential property value even if oil drilling was legalized. Wind was tried and it bothered too many people.

Solar has seen serious growth over the last several decades, and also some publicly funded projects. Solar is a status symbol thing for out-of-area owners to spring for on their own dime. Like luxury yachts, it means good jobs. Subsidizing solar at the county level might come someday, but not yet, the economic impact isn't strong enough compared to the cost of the panels.

>make more property available for farming, that would lower food cost, create agricultural jobs, and would make the county more food secure

In terms of dollars retained in the community, nothing beats agriculture; agricultural revenues circulate within a community longer than other types of revenue. The decline in the county's agriculture is a major factor in the county's economic decline. The county could subsidize agriculture by paying for an extension agent.

A major problem with agriculture is the cost of land and difficulty in finding affordable hired help. The county produces a lot of forage, which is a relatively low labor-intensive crop. If some of these acres were switched to higher value crops this would expand the economy. So a housing subsidy might be good for agriculture too.

Related to this issue is the system with the Cherry Industry Administrative Board and its restriction orders. By frequently ordering the destruction of part of their own crops, they prevent U.S. tart cherries from ever going ""on sale"" in the sort of way that would drive up demand for cherry products. Over decades, this caused U.S. grown tart cherries to lose market share to imports and other fruits. Years ago the Advocate covered these orders in detail, but if this is an unfamiliar topic, [this news article](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/07/28/farmers-dumping-cherries-traverse-city/87676176/)  gives some background. In theory the county could play hardball about this by requiring crop destruction to be publicly reported with an ordinance. The threat of a public shaming might reduce the likelihood of the board voting to destroy otherwise good cherries.

>county hospital

Wouldn't it be something if the hospital in Sturgeon Bay could handle the more serious injuries instead of helicoptering the patients to Green Bay? I wonder how feasible this would be. Besides saving lives, it would also represent more money kept in the community.

>large corporations whose coffers and jobs lie far outside our county

The county could sue Sherwin-Williams [over the lead arsenate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_in_Door_County,_Wisconsin), and use the money to remediate areas with lead in the soil and groundwater. They could even join with Kewaunee County on this, since the lead arsenate once sold in Forestville could explain why there is lead in groundwater between Forestville and Algoma.

It can be difficult to fight back. An example of what resisting the dominance of large corporations looks like is the picture of Kim Roberts getting short term rentals to pay taxes. Then she left and said they need two people to replace her.

>If we want to get ahead we need reduce the number of dollars leaving the county

It was understood from a study of the county from around 50 years ago that tourist-oriented businesses provide somewhat less circulating cash to the local economy than ordinary businesses. This understanding supported the transition away from tourism and towards attracting seasonal residents. The downside is that it is difficult to grow much by attracting seasonal residents. Cottages are a less intense use of the available resources than resorts and state parks. So as tourism and agriculture fade, the benefit from having more seasonal residents around doesn't compensate for the total decline.

Reducing dollars leaving is not just sales, but could also mean investment. I think of various historical ventures people invested in that they simply wouldn't now that there are national banks and a stock market instead. And Sturgeon Bay businessmen subsidized the (entire) cost of electricity out of their own pockets for every new manufacturer willing to set up shop in Sturgeon Bay. If there was some way to encourage people with money to invest in area businesses instead of buying stocks and bonds, that would help. But who wants to invest in a declining economy?

And every child raised in the country also represents an investment, especially the cost of education. When children reach adulthood and move away, it subsidizes the area they move to at the expense of Door County.

"This can help but it’s not nearly enough money to help the people already living here, at best this is a temporary solution. It won’t take long before housing costs outstrip the lodging tax. Now that I think about it it’ll probably make it worse. As the cost of lodging increases it’ll make property ownership more attractive to tourists, we’ll see a rise in AirBnB and short term house rentals. With that’ll come a raise in the cost of housing as residents are increasingly put in direct competition with tourists, which will make residents less and less accommodating to tourists and the tourism industry. Possibly even to the point where it depresses our tourism numbers, in which it’ll make the housing problem worse as we lose income. Edit- After rereading the article I still think this’ll still happen but it’ll take a long time.

We need to curb the sale of property to non residents, when locals can’t afford housing how can we expect to attract anyone who isn’t desperate? 

We need to revisit county and municipal regulations that dictate the maximum number of floors and the density of housing. That can further depress the cost of housing, increase our green spaces. Or make more property available for farming, that would lower food cost, create agricultural jobs, and would make the county more food secure. 

We also need 100% internet coverage, and good reliable internet at a reasonable price. That will bring a huge variety of work at home jobs. 

Or how about investing in offshore and land based turbines, or how about residential solar subsidies. How attractive would Door County be if it became energy independent? Even if only 50% of our energy means were met with county assets how would that extra money improve our community. 

Or how about a public county hospital? Then we can keep the money we would pay to insurance companies or out of county corporations?

I agree with this proposal that it’s needed, but this is a drop in the bucket. We bring in a lot of money thru tourism, enough to support our communities and then some. But every dollar spent in the county is also being taxed by outside interests, large corporations whose coffers and jobs lie far outside our county and usually our state. If we want to get ahead we need reduce the number of dollars leaving the county, then we can make the infrastructure improvements that will make things stable.

"This was in the news yesterday. People were putting graffiti on other things nearby. In response they may ban graffiti on the warehouse building, save one wall. [https://doorcountydailynews.com/news/624286](https://doorcountydailynews.com/news/624286)

Some thoughts on this:

This is an example of a [Giffen good](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/giffen-good.asp) in economics. Demand for ownership in/of ""Door County"" exceeds the supply. Prices go up overall, which channels the available demand towards the cheapest possible substitute. During bad times in the Middle Ages, this drove up the cost of wheat to make bread. Normally, people would eat some meat too, but during bad times people couldn't afford meat, so demand (and price) for wheat increased. Signing your name on the Anderson dock warehouse is an affordable way to have an ownership stake in Door County. Since for most, actually owning property in Door County or sponsoring a public park bench or building aren't realistic options, demand is channeled towards affordable substitutes such as this and previously the old Eagle Tower.

Tourists caused this problem, tourists can solve it. Purchase a nice looking premade wooden fence. Paint it the same color as the warehouse and install it nearby to increase the ""supply"". When it is full, replace it. From time to time, sell completed fence(s) to tourists or seasonal residents during a benefit auction or raffle. The fences, due to their limited supply and unique means of production, (hopefully) will become a [Veblen good](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp), and since Thorstein Veblen did some of his scholarship while on Washington Island, implementing his idea would be both a practical tribute and also fit the area. Veblen goods are status symbols; the more expensive they are the better they sell.

(If this fails to become a Veblen good, and you never know about these things, the fence could be repeatedly repainted, or the fences could be stored for a bit and auctioned at Sotheby's or exported to Norway as genuine Americana.)

The money gained from the auction or raffle could be used to quickly cover up vandalism on nearby structures as fast as it appears and before a trend crops up. Some of the proceeds could go towards paying expenses for A. J.

"This is the strangest thing: Chicago and Milwaukee make a lot of pollution, and then Door County and Newport State Park of all places gets a public shaming for it. What are they supposed to do about it? Relocate to a city for cleaner air? But some Door Countyites embrace the scarlet letter P by filling their burning barrels with mixed plastic and paper trash (even though they have trash pickup). Burning plastic and styrofoam trash is illegal, but not everyone may know that, and if they do, they may not really care because its the DNR.

It is satisfying to watch things burn, and making smoke is a way of making an area yours. In Door County, burning is a status symbol. If you want a cord of the best hardwood, long-cut and split thinly for a satisfying arrangement in your fire pit, you can pay top dollar to have it delivered in person by the woodcutter to your cottage. And the DNR gets to haggle with the EPA over exactly what gets the big ""N"" for Nonattainment: all of Door County, just north of the canal, or just Newport State Park. At least the DNR doesn't throw Door County under the bus.

[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/03/2022-04319/air-plan-approval-wisconsin-redesignation-of-the-revised-door-county-partial-area-to-attainment-of](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-and-wisconsin-propose-door-county-now-meets-federal-air-quality-standard-ozone) has some serious problems. The 2014 data seems good enough, but the 2019 figures came about in a strange way:

>Wisconsin interpolated between the 2016 and 2023 emissions of EPA's 2016 version 1 emissions modeling platform.

So instead of using historical data showing what 2019 pollution figures were, the DNR plotted a slope or a curve going from 2016 to 2023, and picked out the numbers for 2019 in the middle of that.

That's weird to need to do that when 2019 happened in the past. I guess 2016 was the latest figures they had to work with for the tons of different types of pollution coming from different sources.

In Table 1, the data for the monitor in Newport State Park has figures for 2019, 2020, and 2021. But the report claims that the figures show pollution is going down from ""**permanent** and enforceable reductions in emissions **resulting from the implementation** of the SIP and applicable Federal air pollution control regulations and other permanent and enforceable emission reductions""

The report states it like covid didn't have an impact, and the author doesn't even talk about Fyr Bal getting called off. But covid must have had an impact. I don't mean so much from the lower motor traffic from 2020, but from the overall economic slowdown and lower traffic in major urban areas in 2020. There isn't a single mention in the document about the restrictions or impacts at all. As if 2020 was just any ordinary year.

It also doesn't mention whatever impact the high lake levels or the drawdown in Forestville would have had. Wetland microbes produce NOx and VOCs, and Door County has a lot of wetlands. In theory higher lake levels should mean less pollution since there are fewer beach closings during high lake level years. This is from less microbial activity, and which should also come out to fewer NOx and VOCs. But this effect may be a drop in the bucket. I  am not of any studies which look at the relationship between lake level and NOx and VOCs. That could be a job for the EPA.

Whatever the EPA decides, Newport State Park is a very nice clean place.

If something was to actually happen about air pollution, it would mean planting urban trees and forcing new storefronts to be set back further from busy highways. Or public service announcements about everything you used to be able to burn as a child and now you can't because of the DNR. At Preble High School in Green Bay, they monitor the air pollution-even more than what is measured at Newport State Park. And the Lower Fox River Monitoring Project is a group of 11 high schools all working together with student pollution monitoring.

"If this causes some of the lower performing units to be removed from the STR market, they will add to the overall supply of long term rentals. A low end STR rental isn't contributing much to the economy; they would contribute more if they were rented out long term. Some owners of STR rentals are not very serious about actually getting it rented out. They may dabble in it for a season or two as an experiment. For some it is mainly a speculative investment, or they expect to live in it after they retire but want to buy well in advance. Some owners may decide long term rental is a better option because it means less cleaning and work.

In the US, housing is subsidized in various ways, such as with the mortgage system. In Wisconsin there is a cap on property taxes. Even people not directly taking a subsidy may benefit from the overall market being subsidized. People who are buying to rent are taking advantage of subsidies which were intended for residential dwellers and using it to compete against commercial motels and resorts. It isn't Sister Bay's fault that the feds subsidize what they subsidize, yet the distortions on market don't go away by ignoring the impact of the subsidies.

">to allure first generational wealth who value status. What those buildings represent as part of society

There are some modern, cube-based designs here and there near the shore. None are taller than three stories, so they can be overlooked if desired. This lighthouse could possibly be inspired by some of them. And maybe it will inspire cubic concrete condos in imitation. 

Status-seeking goods are also called Veblen goods. People who acquire them are looking for other people's opinions, even if they pretend otherwise.

For some people, making a living doing hard work isn't just something people learn about in a museum.

People who fished and lived in shacks a long time ago were not into Veblen goods like this tower. It is disrespectful for the state government first to choke off their livelihood and force them into other professions, and then subsidize a museum about how they used to live. It makes sense that the same sort of people who a generation ago forced them off the water would then during the present generation, disrespect their memory a second time by subsidizing a museum which ""owns"" their history. Almost like how the Indians were treated. Some of the 1800s fishermen in what is now Door County were Native Americans who lived and worked alongside whites.

"First week of June the water will still be really cold. Probably in the 60's. The water on the Green Bay side of the Peninsula will be warmer than the Lake Michigan side so keep that in mind. If you really want to try snorkeling you could do it with a wetsuit to help stay warm. I recommend kayaking or stand up paddleboarding. Both can be rented at a number of places. The water at Nicolet Beach in Peninsula Park is usually warmer. Not much to see from a snorkeling point of view, but the bottom is nice and sandy and the protected bay and shallow water are great for swimming, and there is a place to rent kayaks and paddleboards right at the beach.

The county used to have a more sustainable economy, but it has transitioned into an economy more based on real estate speculation and rooted in the wealthier transplant community.

One helpful thing about 2020 is that farmers made more money than in 2019. Manufacturing didn't do as badly as real estate and tourism, so the downturn could have been worse. The main problem with the manufacturing industry is that the state does not subsidize it as much as they do in the southern part of the state.

If you make as much or even more money as the yellow line, you are more likely to be accepted even as an outsider. This is because the other newbies around you make about that much. You will need to focus on accumulating obvious status symbols to show you have higher income, and preferably donate to one or more groups. If you make as much money as the black line, other transplants won't accept you, but if you are both really likable and make every effort to conform to existing community standards (Do you play baseball?) you will eventually be accepted by others making about as much as you do.

If your expected income after moving is about as much as the purple line or lower, both the other transplants and those who are from Door County will look down on you. They might tolerate you if you mostly stay out of sight and are a good worker. Life at this sort of income level may still be enjoyable in Door County if you are a member of a close-knit group that will accept you despite your income. This probably means one of the stricter religious groups; you can have your own subculture which accepts you even as many outsiders won't. Eventually you will likely leave as the others in the graph already have, maybe by personal preference or economic factors.",t2_d604a1qo,frexers,0,1642189433.0,0,t1_hso3nc3,hso3nc3,True,oheyydare,t3_rpbypo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/rpbypo/young_couple_wanting_to_move_to_door_county_and/,Young Couple Wanting to Move to Door County and Needing a Little Advice…,/r/DoorCounty/comments/rpbypo/young_couple_wanting_to_move_to_door_county_and/hso3nc3/,0,r/DoorCounty,0,0

"I can't speak for the trans community, but as a gay man I can tell you Door County is very gay-friendly. There isn't quite a gay community like you might find in Saugautuck, MI.

I have a small place up there so I consider myself a part-time resident.

I'm currently single with 3 kids, I probably don't automatically get spotted as a gay man. But I can tell you when my ex and I vacationed there for years with our kids, we were never treated bad or given much of a second look. I often felt people went out of their way to be nice when it was obvious we were a gay couple with kids. I do believe it attracts a more sophisticated crowd than what you might find in The Dells.

"I'm on mobile, so forgive any mistakes.

I think there are going to be more young people around Sturgeon Bay because there are more year-round job opportunities there.  That's not to say you won't find people in your age range in Northern Door, but the declining enrollment in all the local school districts, especially north of Sturgeon Bay, is a sign of changing demographics outside of Sturgeon Bay.

I think making friends would be possible, whether it be through whatever jobs you find or some other ways like church, community groups, hobbies, or whatever.

Most locals are pretty friendly to new people, though maybe cautious at times.  It's hard to answer your question about them being open minded without knowing if there's anything specific you're thinking about.

Like many smaller schools in Wisconsin, the schools are doing the best they can with the funding they have, within the limits of the state school funding formulas and laws.  The teachers I know are passionate and dedicated.  The district in the northern part of the country, Gibraltar, has had some turnover issues recently with administration and some staff that you might want to look into.  The school I attended, Sevastopol, just built a new addition to replace its original 1920s building.  All the schools are supported by their communities, and have good arts and athletic programs, and prepare students well for entering the workforce or some form of post high school education.  They are also ranked well against other schools their size across the state in graduation rates, GPA, and test scores, and frequently win awards for things like school newspapers and co-curriculars.",t2_sgouzbu,balthazar_blue,0,1640574678.0,0,t1_hq3pgwl,hq3pgwl,True,oheyydare,t3_rpbypo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/rpbypo/young_couple_wanting_to_move_to_door_county_and/,Young Couple Wanting to Move to Door County and Needing a Little Advice…,/r/DoorCounty/comments/rpbypo/young_couple_wanting_to_move_to_door_county_and/hq3pgwl/,8,r/DoorCounty,0,8

"Door County can have a lot of traffic and crowds in the summer. May is less crowded than June, which is less crowded than July and August. This list of parks includes many which are not so crowded: [https://wisconsindoorcounty.com/door-county-parks/](https://wisconsindoorcounty.com/door-county-parks/) . The only one of the three lookout towers which is currently open is the the new one in Peninsula State Park. Other good lookout places are down the stairs at Wequiok Falls and from the Ferris wheel at Bay Beach Amusement Park. There is also a decent view from the Maritime Museum in Sturgeon Bay.

If the next summer is like this past one, shops and restaurants put you at risk of catching Covid. Instead you can buy food from grocery stores and eat at parks. Instead of shops, try an open-air farmer's market or U-Pick. Farmers markets in Door County can have more than food, so it is not all that unlike going to shops.

If shops are interesting, you might find Thorstein Veblen's cabin on Washington Island to be an interesting place. He developed extensive economic theories about conspicuous consumption, conspicuous leisure, and why some things sell better the higher they are priced. The first result on google: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/veblen-good.asp)

Many of the shops are near state highways and can have considerable exhaust on some days from the traffic. If you have your heart set on shopping, there are several mall-like establishments where the breathing is easier. Or pick a breezier day and aim for areas upwind of the congestion.

The trolley tours are one option for wineries. If instead you are traveling to them by car, have a designated driver. If you intend to drink and then walk around, look up the community you are in with this map: [https://transportal.cee.wisc.edu/partners/community-maps/crash/search/BasicSearch.do](https://transportal.cee.wisc.edu/partners/community-maps/crash/search/BasicSearch.do) so you can see the location of each pedestrian whose been hit by a vehicle, and also to get an idea of how common drunk drivers are in the area.

It is possible to order books from online sellers before coming which can help you identify wildflowers in the parks: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora\_of\_Door\_County,\_Wisconsin#Further\_reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_of_Door_County,_Wisconsin#Further_reading)",t2_d604a1qo,frexers,0,1637030631.0,0,t1_hksz674,hksz674,True,leslieisadorable,t3_qusp0a,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/qusp0a/planning_a_girls_trip_need_advice_please/,"Planning a girls trip, need advice please!",/r/DoorCounty/comments/qusp0a/planning_a_girls_trip_need_advice_please/hksz674/,1,r/DoorCounty,0,1

Lodging might be less expensive around Sturgeon Bay, but possibly more convenient to try to find something around Egg Harbor, Sister Bay, or Bailey's Harbor.

Good places for cute shops are Egg Harbor, Fish Creek, and Sister Bay.

Lots of winery choices.  My wife and friends like Stone's Throw and Harbor Ridge.  You can also check out Door 44 and Door Peninsula.  Other options for potent potables are Hatch Distiling Co and Door County Brewing Co.

"**[Satisficing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing)** 
 
 >Satisficing is a decision-making strategy or cognitive heuristic that entails searching through the available alternatives until an acceptability threshold is met. The term satisficing, a portmanteau of satisfy and suffice, was introduced by Herbert A. Simon in 1956, although the concept was first posited in his 1947 book Administrative Behavior. Simon used satisficing to explain the behavior of decision makers under circumstances in which an optimal solution cannot be determined. He maintained that many natural problems are characterized by computational intractability or a lack of information, both of which preclude the use of mathematical optimization procedures.

"There's several questions in there.

First, Starlink is the best answer right now.   It can be a bit spendy, and for best results you need a clear view of the entire sky .. but it's the best answer for internet speed.

If that's not an option and Frontier ""up to 12 megs"" is your only option for improvement, then that's all you got.

Is 12 megs good enough?   Actually, yes, although it's important to know the ""up"" bandwidth.  Perhaps it's 12/1 (12 down, 1 up) service?  12 sounds like DSL, so I'm guessing 12/1.

1 up is .. barely sufficient for a Zoom call.   Zoom specifies 1 meg for their lowest 480p video.   It *should* work with 1 meg, but it very well could be choppy.  (720p HD video needs 1.8 megs up.)

Another problem with 1 up service .. imagine if you took some video with your phone, and most people send their photos/videos to a cloud service like Apple or Google photos.  When your phone connects to wifi and uploads your 3 minute video .. it might take 15-30 minutes to upload -- which is OK -- but that upload will max out the pipe (so to speak) and for 15-30 minutes you'll be trying to surf the web and performance will be awful until the video upload ends.   (This can be solved with QoS settings on your router, but that's an advanced topic.)

12 megs down is sufficient for video streams.  While 12 megs should support one 4k video stream .. most services aren't streaming 4k .. so 12 megs down could support more than one 1080p or 720p streams.     In short, yes, you could stream your Netflix.

.. Anecdotally .. we took a trip to an island this summer and had a DSL connection that tapped out at 1.5 megs down, 768k up.   My kids were able to stream Youtube at low resolution and it was .. not great, but OK.

That shows how over-sold we all are on bandwidth.",t2_5fbba,duncantuna,0,1634913654.0,0,t1_hhmizq3,hhmizq3,True,Anxious_RN,t3_qd1b4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/qd1b4i/frontier_internet_in_door_county/,Frontier internet in Door County?,/r/DoorCounty/comments/qd1b4i/frontier_internet_in_door_county/hhmizq3/,2,r/DoorCounty,0,2

"Door County Motorsports might have a rental. Some years the trails aren't open much. Door County is warmer in the winter than other northern Wisconsin places, this is a downside for that sort of thing.

In the past the county had three downhill ski areas, then it had two, then one, and now it has zero. The Kewaunee Winter Park is the closest place.

Understand that not all of the parks may have their parking lots cleared of snow. Especially do not expect the Land Trust preserves to be cleared.

Look up crash statistics on [https://transportal.cee.wisc.edu/partners/community-maps/crash/search/BasicSearch.do](https://crashmapper.com) ... from this you can see that plenty of people think it would be fun to head out in the winter, but it doesn't always work out that well. Urban standards for clear roads are higher than rural standards; if you come from a city you may not be used to it, or have snow tires. Norman Blei used to play up being snowed in as a plus, but he was a writer who liked being stuck at home.

"Thanks for clarifying.  I asked because the entire Door Peninsula is about 80 miles long, and Door County covers 2,370 square miles.  I didn't want to suggest things that might be a long drive, especially in the winter.

That said, a Sturgeon Bay address still comprises a lot of area.  It could be within the city limits of Sturgeon Bay, or it could also include any of the rural areas served by the Sturgeon Bay post office and thus in the 54235 ZIP code.  Considering what I've been reading recently and that you're staying in an Airbnb, I think it's fairly likely you're in Sturgeon Bay or very close.

A few points of information before I start listing recommendations:

* A lot of places reduce hours or even shut down entirely during the off season, so you'll want to check ahead to see who's open and when.
* I don't live there anymore, but I'm a Door County native, still have family there, and visit frequently.  There are some places and things we like to keep to ourselves.

Hitting some of your points first:

* Snowmobiling: Everyone I knew/know that snowmobiles has their own.  I unfortunately can't help with this one.
* Stargazing: State or county parks are a good option for this, but any rural area that's sufficiently dark would be adequate.  Newport State Park is north of Bailey's Harbor, so constitutes a considerable drive from where you're staying.  If you want something closer, consider Potowatomi State Park, Whitefish Dunes State Park, or Cave Point County Park.  You could also consider driving to the lake shore by Whitefish Bay (little hamlet east of Valmy) or visiting some of the nearby boat launches at night, like Lily Bay or Shoreline Boat Launch out near Sherwood Point.  You could even try the Door County Motorcycle Memorial on Mathey Road or the Sevastopol Town Park in Institute.
* Hiking: Cave Point County Park doesn't have much hiking itself, though you can easily enter Whitefish Dunes State Park's trails from there.  Someone else mentioned The Ridges Sanctuary, which while a bit of a drive since it's in the Bailey's Harbor/Toft Point area, would be worth it.  It's a fascinating combination of ecosystems, and the trails include the old Bailey's Harbor Range Lights.
* Food: for classic Wisconsin supper clubs, I recommend The Mill, The Nightingale, and Donny's Glidden Lodge, all in or near Sturgeon Bay.  If you visit the Bailey's Harbor area, you can check out the Cornerstone Pub for food and Door County Brewing Co. for beer, and Coyote Roadhouse (if they're open) on Kangaroo Lake.  We also like Casey's in Egg Harbor for barbecue, and Mr. G's near Jacksonport is another classic supper club.  Other places worth trying include Sonny's Pizza and Trattoria Dal Santo in Sturgeon Bay, and Belgian Delight in Brussels.  Al Johnson's is worth the drive, especially for breakfast, and will be much easier to get into during the winter.  Another of our favorites in Sister Bay is J.J.'s.
* Lighthouses: I already mentioned the Bailey's Harbor range lights if you get to The Ridges.  The Cana Island lighthouse is in the same area.  You can also visit the Sturgeon Bay canal lighthouses.  You could also check to see if you can visit the the Sherwood Point lighthouse.  The rest of the lighthouses are either inaccessible year round, or would be very difficult to get to in the winter.

Other ideas:

* Scenic stuff: You already mentioned Cave Point.  You could also look at George K Pinney (formerly Olde Stone Quarry) County Park, or if you're willing to drive, Door Bluff Headlands County Park.
* Museums: Check hours for the Door County Historical Museum, the Door County Maritime Museum, and the Miller Art Center (inside the Sturgeon Bay branch of the Door County Library), all in Sturgeon Bay.
* Potent potables: If you like wine, beer, or spirits, check the hours for:
   * Stone's Throw Winery
   * Harbor Ridge Winery
   * Simon Creek Winery
   * Door 44 Winery
   * Door Peninsula Winery and Distillery
   * Hatch Distillery
   * Door County Brewing Co.
* Coffee shops: There are some options in Sturgeon Bay.  The first two that come to mind are Kick and Glas.
* Farmer's markets: Most farmer's markets will probably be shut down, but for a comparable experience or for local specialty foods, check the hours for Lautenbach's Orchard Country, Koepsel's Farm Market, Grandma Tommy's, Marchant's Meats, Renard's Cheese, and Welsing's Foodland.
* Other stuff: Miniature golf/fun parks will be shut down.  I've been itching to try Cherry Lanes Arcade Bar, though.

If you're into bars/taverns, let me know what you like and I can point you to a few places.

If you have any questions, just ask!

"Major factors to consider are the moon and the weather. Pick a night with a last quarter, waning crescent, or new moon when you expect it will be cloudless.

Lighthouse beacons can be annoying when watching the night sky.

This can be a guide for where to camp: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon\_Bay,\_Wisconsin#/media/File:ISS030-E-183973.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon_Bay,_Wisconsin#/media/File:ISS030-E-183973.jpg)

From the picture you can see that the shore on the Door County part of the Door Peninsula is mostly ringed with houses and cottages, except for the parks. The really dark areas are where it is hard to pick out where the shore is.

It is dark on the lake side of the peninsula except for Kewaunee, Algoma, Jacksonport, and Baileys Harbor. Unfortunately, the campgrounds tend to be near the cities. Newport State Park is the major exception to this, and also the adjacent Wagon Trail Campground.

Major sky glow factors are the city of Green Bay, Menominee & Marinette, and Sturgeon Bay.

Newport State Park is one of many areas with a dark sky; notice that all the islands are really dark, also the east side of Green Bay (not on the Door Peninsula) is really dark as long as you are away from the cities.

If you are coming from the west, I recommend this campground: [https://www.browncountywi.gov/community/parks-department/general-information/camping/](https://www.browncountywi.gov/community/parks-department/general-information/camping/) , especially because I don't expect there will be many people there and because there are opportunities for viewing different directions in the sky--such as over the grassy park, over the bay from the park benches on the escarpment, and from the beach. The downside is there are some lights on the restroom buildings and also from highway 57 traffic. Possibly some sky glow from Dyckesville and definitely some from the city of Green Bay.

If you are coming from the southeast, you might look at this one, especially if you can reserve a site near one of the picnic areas by the lake: [https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/pointbeach/recreation/camping](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/parks/pointbeach/recreation/camping) .

"I’ve spent a couple nights across the last two years at Site 4. 

All camping is hike in, so you ideally should be able to fit it inside backpacks, or use a wagon. 

Each site has a bench, sometimes two - no need for camp chairs.  

Some sites have toilets without doors, so be mindful of that if privacy is a concern. The ones without doors have a partial height wall in the direction of neighboring sites to serve as a privacy screen. 

Water you can filter right out from the lake. 

Firewood? You’re OK to burn dead and downed wood but a lot of it gets and stays damp because of spray and moisture from the lake. I always suggest people bring a bundle or two of dry, seasoned wood to start the fire and you can use that to dry out and bring the stuff you find around the campsite. 

And as another said, there’s no cell service up there, so make sure you’ve got what you need to keep everyone entertained!

I’ve never had problems with bugs, but it does get chilly when the wind coming across the lake picks up, so usually plan for it to be a little cooler than you’d think. 

There is no light pollution so you’ll have as good a view of the night sky as you can get, but you’ll just have to hope for good weather and a campsite that opens up to the sky. If your site is wooded, you could always set your headlamp(s) to red light, pack some chairs or sit pads, and head over toward Newport Bay to enjoy it from there.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy\_of\_Door\_County,\_Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Door_County,_Wisconsin) has a breakdown of the different parts of Door County's economy. If you really want to dig into statistics, look in the references for 2001–2018 & 2019 figures. Looking at the spreadsheet with 2001-2018 figures, there is a smaller breakdown showing only ""arts, entertainment, and recreation"". This area was flat in real-dollar amounts and failed to expand with inflation from 2014-2018. Previously it grew from 2011-2014, having previously contracted from 2007-2011 because of the recession. On the other hand, ""Accommodation and food services"" did better, having only one flat year since between the recession and 2018; otherwise it had steady growth.

The long term trends suggest that Door County will continue to be a good place to operate rentals and install solar panels. Manufacturing expands and contracts with the economy, and typically pays better than restaurants. ""Arts, entertainment, recreation, accommodation, and food services"" is a large chunk of the economy too, but has not experienced the same degree of success as some of the other areas. This could partly explain why wages have not been the greatest for this area when compared to the rising cost of living.

"There are a ton of things to do, but these are the main ones that come to mind!

Coffee: Analog, Leroy’s (if it’s open - it hasn’t seemed to be open for a while but for sure check!), Bearded Heart

Breakfast: White Gull Inn (the cherry French toast is divine!), Al Johnson’s

Lunch: Casey’s BBQ

Dinner: Parador (tapas), Whistling Swan (lovely atmosphere), Shipwrecked (cheese curds), Wild Tomato (pizza), Casey’s BBQ, or you could go to a fish boil or go the traditional Wisconsin supper club route 

Dessert: Custard at Not Licked Yet, ice cream at Wilson’s, sweetie pie’s 

Cute shops: Jackalope Trading Co (Bailey’s Harbor), Good Leaf Greenhouse (Bailey’s Harbor)

To do: Watch the breathtaking sunset in Egg Harbor at the harbor or at sunset beach in Fish Creek; walk around Sister Bay and Fish Creek; drive up Route 42 on the bay side up to the tip of the peninsula (I love the drive into Ephraim) (if you have time you can depart from there by ferry to Washington Island which has lavender farms, Schoolhouse beach, and bike riding);  Peninsula State Park (they have lookout points so you don’t necessarily have to go hiking); Hands On Art Studio is also great especially if there is a rainy day (they have ceramics but also a myriad of other things including glass work, metal work, etc and they show you how to do everything!

"These three places are the ones first suggested to me on my first visit, and based on my own positive experience, the ones I now recommend myself. 

Breakfast: Red Cup is great for coffee and a bagel or breakfast sandwich - the closer you can arrive to opening the less time you’ll spend waiting in line (it’s about the one and only legitimate coffee shop on the island, and a good one!). Their breakfast burrito is only sometimes offered as a special, but when they do, it is always fire. 

Lunch: Jackson Harbor Soup has a great selection  of homemade soups, sandwiches and salads you can enjoy while looking out at the harbor, but I don’t know when their season ends. Be sure to order “The Welcome Basket” so you can try a cup of soup and a half salad or half sandwich. 

Dinner: It looks like the season ends on October 23rd at Hotel Washington, if you planned to stay long enough to have dinner someplace. Probably the most legitimate meal, period, you’ll find on island. They have a small dining room, so if you plan on eating here, be sure to make a reservation prior (online or by phone) to guarantee yourselves a table. 

If the hotel is closed for the season, try the old staples on Main Road - KK Fiske (fish) or Nelsen’s (bar food). 

Or just pack a lunch! Bring a cooler with ice, and pick up some deli or bakery items from the mainland on your drive up. Many folks like to stop by Charlie’s Smokehouse (in Ellison Bay) for their smoked fish dips and carry those along on the ferry ride over to the island. 

I’m actually leaving Friday for Washington Island and will be there through the weekend. Red Cup is closed this weekend, but we will be having dinner at Hotel Washington on Saturday evening. 

The island is VERY seasonal (think Memorial Day through Labor Day) and even during high season has a limited number of options, compared to the mainland.

Best bet is to call ahead and just ask a business directly if they’ll be open. Sounds old fashioned, but it’s usually the best way of reaching businesses that don’t have a website and are lucky to have any sort of presence on social media. 

Fun things to do?

One of the best parts of the island is that most the activities are public spaces. Parking and admission are free, and many even have restrooms. Some might ask for pay what you can donations, if you’re able and inclined. 

Most everything there is to do is outside, and since it’s further north than most visitors live, bring warm layers and prepare for rain so you can still enjoy the island even despite bad weather. 

Here’s what we always do:

1.) Schoolhouse Beach. Go first thing in the morning (bring your coffee and breakfast along) and beat the crowds. Must do, one of only a few limestone beaches like it in the world. The water is usually too damn cold for swimming, but stay awhile and try building a cairn (stack of rocks) instead.

2.) The Stavkirke (stave church) is a beautiful piece of handmade architecture reflective of this region’s Scandinavian heritage. A short “prayer path” leads from the road and through the woods, back toward the chapel. The property also adjoins the Domer-Neff Nature Preserve and Bird Sanctuary, if you want some more time outside without having to move your car. Since the start of the pandemic you can’t *step* inside the chapel (they installed a clear plastic wall blocking entrance to the chapel), but you can still *see* inside (they also installed a motion-sensored light that turns on when someone approaches the doorway). Even though the interior is still closed, the exterior is still enough a reason to stop here. 

3.) Mountain Park Lookout Tower is, as the name implies, an observation tower. If you continue down the trail at the top of the hill, past the tower, it’s a nice bit of “out and back” hiking. While the tower has been closed since last year, the hiking trail more than makes up for it. 

4.) People’s Park is down a small trail off to the left of parking for Little Lake, and is the best place to watch the sunset. There are some benches, otherwise, folks lean up against the fence, and the most adventurous climb over it to sit atop the rocks to take in the view and waves. 

ALSO - there is a great visitor’s guide brochure out there specifically for Washington Island, and if you see a copy, grab one, because it includes a map and basic information about all businesses on the island. There is no proper travel guidebook written about the island, and this is about as close as I’ve come to finding one.

"Pheasant Park in Sister Bay, The Landing Resort in Egg Harbor, and Bailey’s Harbor Yacht Club. 

Pheasant Park is the least updated of them all, but reasonable if you need a big place with multiple bedrooms. They have an indoor pool. Great location as you are right near downtown Sister Bay. I will say while our room was just fine, it was not as clean as the other two hotels I am listing. I have stayed at many places in DC and this is my least favorite.

The Landing is more updated than Pheasant Park, yet not modern by any means. Very quaint and beautiful lobby area that you can actually use. They have a pool and hot tub. A little more price wise than Pheasant park, but nothing crazy. However, it is located in Egg Harbor which is 25 mins south of Pheasant Park. 

Bailey’s Harbor Yacht club is fairly modern. Everything looks and feels newer. They have a pool and hot tub. Pretty location, right on the lake. Reasonable prices. I got a room in winter for $130 a night.

I highly suggest The Landing if you are ok with the longer drive. Otherwise, we do VRBO or Lundquist Rentals out of Sister Bay.

"Been coming up for 30+ years and looking to buy a home up there this year. Here are my suggestions:

Breakfast: Village cafe in Egg Harbor, Good Eggs in Ephraim (they only serve breakfast burritos, outdoor seating only currently, and must order thru app- but worth it!), Chef’s Hat Cafe in Ephraim, and the Old Post Office Restaurant in Ephraim. I heard Chives in Bailey’s Harbor has a great breakfast, but I personally haven’t tried it. My favorite is Village Cafe in Ephraim and Chef’s Hat comes in a close second. Old Post Office is good for a regular ol’ breakfast. 

Dinner: Wickman House. Hands down the best food in DC. It can be pricey with drinks and appetizers but it is so worth it. Wild Tomato- I recommend eating at the sister bay location and eating it just behind the restaurant on the city’s public picnic tables right on the bay. White Gull Inn for a fish boil (reservations recommended!), Chop in Sister Bay if you’re looking for steak or seafood, Harbor Fish Market and grill for seafood - they have the best lobster Mac and cheese I have ever had in my entire life. 

I would have more recommendations but many of the staple restaurants that have been around forever have gone out of business in the last year. 

Drinks: As someone previously said, the only nightlife is in sister bay, so if you’re a drinker stick around there. Husby’s is open late. Try the beer cheese soup! They have a cool little beer garden/outdoor bar. Sister Bay Boathouse is a cool place to grab a drink. You can sit on their rooftop area which overlooks the marina. Also in sister bay is the beer garden next to Al Johnson’s. They have a full bar and music on weekend nights. It is pet and kid friendly. Bayside Tavern in fish creek is a nice little place to get a cocktail. If you’re near Bailey’s Harbor, the Blue Ox is open fairly late year round. Stone’s Throw in Bailey’s Harbor is our favorite place to do a wine tasting. They have a patio out back where you can buy a glass or two of their wine to enjoy. 

A suggestion for those with kids: Hands On Art Studio. This place is awesome. You can paint, make mosaics, glaze ceramics, weld, make jewelry, fuse glass, among other things. There’s snacks and drinks available, including beer for adults. Seriously, this place is a winner.",t2_8lzczn7l,RazzmatazzLeading488,0,1630508179.0,0,t1_hb70274,hb70274,True,sinnamongrrrl,t3_p8z5wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/p8z5wj/visiting_for_the_first_time/,Visiting for the first time,/r/DoorCounty/comments/p8z5wj/visiting_for_the_first_time/hb70274/,1,r/DoorCounty,0,1

Grand Traverse Island State Park is probably the most famously obscure Door County destination. Due to a longstanding feud between the county and state governments, its existence is not recognized by the typical tourism information sources. If you go, please share photos.

(A much larger parcel on the opposite side of the island is owned by the FWS, and is also open to   
 the public, but not year-round. The State Park and adjacent Land trust parcels are open year-round. To figure out where to visit, try the ""Door County Web Map"" on the county website.

"I've looked into the origins of xenophobia; by now I understand that the county was not originally so xenophobic, but it became that way due to acculturation from tourists and transplants from exclusive suburbs and neighborhoods in the Chicago area and maybe some other areas. So many status-seeking people came to the county that the overall value system changed towards that end, with the pursuit of money becoming more important as a means to acquire status. Good contrasts in culture (if you want to verify what I write for yourself) are Algoma and Kewaunee; they were not affected so much by acculturation, and also suffer less from xenophobia.

A century ago, people with the ""native"" vs. ""non-native"" and utilitarian money oriented mindset were publicly countered by Hjalmar Holand, who argued that the merchant must understand that the tourist does not exist to make him money.

Unfortunately, Hjalmar Holand lost, but not completely. There are still people in Door County who will will respect you as a person instead of treat you with like a money vending machine. Other than that, you can minimize the xenophobia by avoiding establishments where overtourism creates extra stress on the owners and employees.",t2_d604a1qo,frexers,0,1630162182.0,0,t1_haorw6y,haorw6y,False,frexers,t3_p3hgh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/p3hgh3/this_pisses_me_off/,This pisses me off,/r/DoorCounty/comments/p3hgh3/this_pisses_me_off/haorw6y/,0,r/DoorCounty,0,0

"Sandman's comments are spot on.  

I'd put in a vote for everything he wrote.  Sister Bay, Eagle Trail, Cherry Hut, Wild Tomato, etc.

I'd call out the Northern Sky Theater too, it's a unique experience to see a play outdoors.    -- Or the Skyway drive-in movie theater.

I'd also say .. try having lunch at PC Junction.  It's aimed more at kids, but their outdoor campus is entertaining, pedal carts through the woods, outdoor chess, visit a pig or two.  Max quirky.

Another tip .. Door County is spread out.  Choose lodging that's a few minutes walk to a ""downtown.""   You're going to be driving around from town to town, parks, lunch, whatever.

"Where are you staying first off?

Sister Bay is hands down our favorite town and only town for a night life. Husby's is your best night life scene - music usually starting at 7. Stabbur has a great outdoor biergarten. The bowling alley is vintage and has an outdoor bar. Door County Brewing in Bailey's harbor is great.

If you're looking for 2 mile hikes I'd recommend the Eagle Trail in Peninsula State Park, The Ridges Sanctuary Bailey's Harbor, Door Bluff Headlands County Park, or newport state park lynd point-fern loop. Peninsula State Park has a neat tower and plenty of drive and stop scenic areas.

Check out The Cherry Hut (brewery, winery, market) outside Fish Creek and Lautenbach's. Koepsel's Farm Market, Seaquist Orchards, and Wood Orchard are all common too.

Cana Island Lighthouse is cool if it isn't too busy.

I'd recommend driving North all the way to Washington Island ferry. Nice area to walk around and scenic along the way.

Best sandwich's imo are Door County Creamery (turkey brie) or Blue Horse in Fish Creek. If you've never had Wild Tomato pizza it's a most - I'd make this a priority.

Finally - if you can... try getting tickets to the Northern Sky Theatre in Peninsula State Park. The shows are cheap but amazing.

"Wild Tomato is a victim of their own success.

Locals don't like wait lists to get a table. My main issue with Wild Tomato is that they push so much pizza through their oven(s), the floor of their oven gets cooled down by fresh dough, and often you're not getting the proper char on the bottom of the crust. They know this, so they try to compensate with a longer cook time. But then you get a pizza that's slightly overcooked on top, and slightly undercooked on the bottom.

It's keeping them from moving from the ""really good"" column to the ""really great"" column, at least for me.",t2_1ycqnxek,Pizzarepresent,0,1629036840.0,0,t1_h916one,h916one,False,[deleted],t3_p4ic0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/p4ic0p/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/DoorCounty/comments/p4ic0p/deleted_by_user/h916one/,1,r/DoorCounty,0,1

"My family has been here for generations. Hardworking, community building, and of course land owning. With all the Airbnb development, the million dollar mansions, and excess of hotels my family has prospered. But we have noticed that this is starting to lean towards customers using cheaper alternatives. GFS has taken a quarter of business from what we once had and it doesn't seem to slow down. Alot of it is the new owners who take over old businesses. 

Some of our family is moving to Kewaunee just to be closer to GB where there are better paying jobs. Some moved to the UP or Minnesota. I wish DC would do something about the Airbnb development but I don't see it happening. The other side of that coin is the mansions. I don't have too big an issue with it, actually. They tend to spend money in the county and I appreciate that. They are often out of sight too. Unless you are driving moonlight bay or back roads I haven't seen too many.

"Most natives left for many reasons; because of good opportunities elsewhere, the federal strategy to separate the Potawatomi into different bands, and the typical treaty type arrangement with the more centralized Winnebago. But some stayed in the county into the early 1900s, living as a minority in the land that was once belonged to their grandparents. They did not live in a traditional lifestyle, but paid taxes and were counted by the census. I think you can relate.

Natives at first were more prosperous than many settlers, (many who were squatters, some francophone like the natives were). But as time went on more prosperous settlers came, and the earlier ones that survived became more wealthy. Like a flood, you aren't going to win the culture wars. (In the 19th century, culture divides in the county split between Winnebago/Potawatomi, allegiance to the Crown/USA, anglophone/francophone, farming/fishing, tribal religion/Christianity, and polygamy/monogamy.) These sorts of culture wars were answered one way or the other. If you are a Native American in Door County in the 20th century, you aren't going to change that; instead you pick and chose what matters to you.

Simon Kahquados and Roy Oshkosh were very deliberate at what they wanted to accomplish. They didn't think they could just fight the culture war in the traditional manner of fighting such culture wars.

You might decide it is better to give up on the county. If you want to experience something like your ancestors' Door County, visit the Garden Peninsula in Delta County. You may find better opportunities elsewhere; places where people are friendlier, less xenophobic, and less class-conscious. There are still places like this in the US. Or maybe you will someday, somehow get wealthy enough to fit in.

As for what is left of Door County for you personally right now? That is what you make of it. You might have a small fraction of the community and opportunity your ancestors had, but that doesn't keep you from making the most of it.

As for the puff piece, those are subsidized by Destination Door County. They pay lots of money for media placement programs and subsidizing journalists. All the puff piece means is that somebody from NYC got a sweet deal in return for writing another puff piece.

Puff pieces will rot your soul if you take them seriously, so don't. They tend to appeal to base impulses, and entice, but not satisfy. If they were art, they would be considered kitsch. As the rapper RZA (Robert Fitzgerald Diggs) said, ""If you keep eating McDonald's, you gonna get sick. You need a real home-cooked meal"". He meant that about rap... if you go listening to what the media barons call rap it is no good; he put art into his craft so it would be a home-cooked meal. The purpose of a puff piece is to make people thirsty for Door County so they will come and generate room and sales taxes. But what you need is a home cooked meal; be it of stuff about Door County or wherever you decide is your heartland.

I, and some I know, sometimes have vivid dreams of walking though a Door County that is sort of like what we know, but is larger, wilder, more fruitful, and has an old schoolhouse where you can attend and learn. It is not built up and overrun. Don't give up; go and learn and explore. It will inspire you, think of the lyrics, ""Oh Parson Tell Me Quickly / Will My Soul Pass Through The Southland"". The soldier in the song needed a Southland to understand what heaven must be like.

Also, on June 5, 2015, there was an accident involving a senior citizen driver and a failure to wear seat belt(s). There was one fatality and one injury.

This database also records two minor accidents in the Culver's parking lot. The most recent one was on November 3, 2019, it involved a senior citizen aged driver who was not wearing a seatbelt. There were no injuries in this accident or the other one, which was from 2018; just property damage.

">So it's going to start to look like every overly traversed small town in America.

Federal grants have uniform standards.... typically what happens is a town needs money to repair their road or replace utilities. But to qualify for the grant they must widen the road, and to widen it they must remove the roadside trees.

From what I've read on this, they plan to pay for it with property tax money. I didn't see anything about grants.

"Most of these comments are spot-on. One thing that has not been mentioned are the taxes for waterfront property. Think H-I-G-H. Also, pay attention to taxes. Each of the municipalities (townships or villages) have their own tax rates - so your location can be a pretty big variable. My house, for instance, abuts the start of a neighboring township - taxes up the road from me for a similar older house in a rural setting, run a couple hundred to nearly a thousand dollars higher than what I pay.

The local animus towards Air BnB is pretty well outlined here (and valid).

"Subsidized affordable housing in Door County goes back to 1943 with the Sunset Trailer Park for veterans in Sturgeon Bay. The administration building for the trailer park was later sold so it could become a gradeschool.

Then in the 70s, the Bayview Terrace was constructed to house the elderly, who at the time couldn't be APSed into nursing homes. Because 2% of the cost had to be raised elsewhere for the feds to fund it, both the city and county contributed to it. That is somewhat comparable to Sister Bay being willing to fork out $460,000 for this project.

Bayview Terrace didn't happen overnight. Lobbying for the project goes back at least to 1969, and it took until late 1974 for a final decision to begin construction, with occupancy scheduled for September 1, 1975. It is still operating today.

After that came the Mapleridge Apartments, which are also still operating today. 32 units were for the elderly and 24 for those with a moderate income.

Another project for the elderly was the Velkommen Apartments on Washington Island. They had to find 25 people willing to invest $5 each in order to qualify for funding. The apartments received an award in 2016 ( [https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/news-release/usda-presents-award-excellence-velkommen-apartments](https://www.rd.usda.gov/newsroom/news-release/usda-presents-award-excellence-velkommen-apartments) ). It was dedicated on June 2, 1976.

"look to see if you can pre-schedule the uber drives otherwise you will likely not find anything. There are a few shuttle / party bus options but you're likely late on that.

Sister Bay is the only town that will have an actual night life other than Sturgeon Bay. Husby's is probably the main one for outside music and lively crowd. Stabbur is a great place as well. CHOP is in sister bay and has a good steak + seafood menu.

I'd make a trip to Door Count Brewing. Neat place for a beer or two. Can stop at Coyote Roadhouse too.

There is a new place called the Cherry Hut that is definitely worth stopping at for beer and wine tasting. Market inside as well and the food is great, smaller sized tacos and hotdogs.

"Quarter 1 saw 20 Elder Abuse/Neglect cases, of these, 90% can be expected to be for self-neglect. In theory this could free up to 18 homes or apartments for workers.

As of Quarter 1 there were 48 people being held by court order in a care facility. An annual WATTS review is required. Had they stayed at home, that could be as many as 48 fewer homes or apartments for workers. Or maybe more than 48, given that once in a care facility, nationally the median lifespan is only five months after placement. The total number of people under a court order is constantly changing as some die and others get new court orders.

Figures are from page 11: [https://www.co.door.wi.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/\_05102021-902](https://www.co.door.wi.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_05102021-902)

How many of the Adult Protective Services reports came from Ephraim? I don't know. The total 2019 population in Ephraim was 268 people. Sturgeon Bay currently has 400 affordable housing apartments. That is nearly a half a percent of their whole population. Proportionally, for Ephraim to have the same percent that would mean 12 people. So they only would have to APS 12 seniors into care facilities to be even with Sturgeon Bay, proportionally speaking. It is possible they have already done that in the last few years.

If Ephraim residents are to be convinced of the merits of affordable housing one way could be to ask ""Who wants to get APSed next?"" In theory the county could stop APSing so many seniors into care facilities if the housing shortage could be resolved by O'Malley's Inn or another way. With the full picture, Ephraim residents could realize that affordable housing is a win-win situation for them. They get to avoid being placed in a nursing home, and workers get an affordable housing project.

Algoma could be a model for Ephraim: They just got $1 million for affordable housing: [https://doorcountydailynews.com/news/583035](https://doorcountydailynews.com/news/583035)

The Kewaunee County APS referral figure for 2019 was only 13% of Door County's figure; another way to look at it is that for every 15 seniors APSed in Door County, only 2 were APSed in Kewuanee County. Because they are willing to build affordable housing that means both workers and seniors can live as neighbors in homes and apartments.

"If I was tasked with building a structure to house so much rich history, I wouldn’t prioritize the exterior over what’s inside. Most of the other residents here who I’m close with have never been the sort of people to care about other peoples opinions. Utility and practicality prevail.

The condo buildings along the waterfronts offer nothing to the community and are made to allure first generational wealth who value status. What those buildings represent as part of society is far uglier.

The fact that a lighthouse that is part of a modern museum specific to the fascinating history of the area is refreshing.

"I bought a home on Sturgeon Bay where I live year round. It’s among the best decisions I’ve ever made. The community is frustrated, and rightfully so, with the influx of buyers who are contributing to a housing shortage and aren’t just gone for the winter, but will opt to rent their homes out on AirBnB (the worst case scenario for their neighbors) in their absence.

Where you decide you’re most happy is where you should live. I found a house on Sturgeon Bay across from the shipyard, so I’ve got free entertainment year-round, neighbors who are each incredibly interesting, kind, and remarkable in their own way. I’ve learned it’s like a safe haven for some very talented, brilliant people who often aren’t the types to care about the opinions of others. There’s a great deal of mutual respect among my neighbors and a true sense of community which I never except rifled in a city. Like many others, I’ve lived and worked in nyc, Baltimore and San Francisco and knew what I wanted when I saw it. I’m in an environment that makes me the best version of myself.

If you followed local news in the area, your post would be considered tone deaf since vacation rentals are a very polarizing topic. If you lived here and had a rental property, it’d be easier for folks to swallow but what you’ve described would contribute to a major problem in the area.

Based on historical patterns, the vacation boom will likely wind down as restrictions relax and federal subsidies end, thus removing a source of revenue for many.

A home on the water is a lot of responsibility and upkeep for someone who isn’t onsite or living locally. I bought my home from someone who after three years threw in the towel. Some of the  guests that I’ve heard about from neighbors did things which make you question humanity.

Based on the context I’ve been given, the primary types of guests were bachelorette parties, couples letting lose for a weekend, occasional professionals enjoying the amazing view while working remote and a few families. To allure a family you need amenities as parents like to have plenty of options to keep their kids busy so they can also have a break.

You should do a lot more research and calculate the value of your own time by the hour. The opportunity cost may not be worth it. There’s definitely inflation in home prices given the scarcity. It’s usually wise to purchase an investment property when it’s a buyers market since investments shouldn’t be made with any urgency. You have the advantage of time and options while many others don’t, so perhaps wait for the market to cool off and in the meantime brush up on economics, patterns in housing markets, and then come up with a business plan.",t2_1568dn,thewolfoftheweb,0,1627442520.0,0,t1_h6se9zo,h6se9zo,True,BelgianBillie,t3_os155k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/os155k/thinking_of_buying_a_vacation_home_should_it_be/,Thinking of buying a vacation home.

Oh yeah definitely. The roads here are maintained very well. It’s the amount of traffic we get and the long lines of cars that are getting to be a problem. The best solution would be build more roads but the downside to that is removing trees and destroying land. Another solution would be 4 lane highways but again we can’t extend our roads that wide because of how small the towns are and the closeness of buildings to the road.

"The biggest thing right now is to be kind and patient. Expect most restaurants to have long waits (even up to two hours). Small businesses are short on staff and may not be able to help you find something right away and there may be long lines. Most places are also not doing carry out or outdoor dining but may be able to fit in carry out during slower times (beginning and ending of business hours) due to staff shortage. If your favorite place is busy or not able to meet your needs do some digging and find other places you may have not been before, there are a lot of new and amazing businesses up here that need the business. And most importantly watch for pedestrians and be mindful when you’re driving up here and pay attention to the road.

Not particularly however some of the properties have potential. I myself am thinking of buying a house with adequate property to start a small business. I’ve looked at some of the farm type properties and if you put the effort in to them you can really transform them.

Yes however we’re catering more to tourists than our own residents and no one can find affordable housing because all of the out of towners/out of staters are retiring up here and buying summer homes or homes to turn in to Airbnb’s. If you do some digging you will find it’s been very detrimental to our community. School enrollments are going down and younger residents are moving elsewhere. And this year more than ever has been tough on residents because there are more tourists than ever and not enough workers because of J-1 students not being able to work here. There is only so much room on a peninsula and building more and more for tourism will destroy the wildlife and environment. I love the tourism but it’s getting to a point where we don’t have room for people up here and I don’t think people are realizing that. I’ve worked in customer service up here since I was 12 (at a family business for two years) and have had so many rude encounters which are almost always by tourists who think they’re entitled to everything because they are on vacation. Not to mention the traffic is out of hand too and the roads can’t handle the amount of traffic we’ve been getting. I want people to be able to come up here and enjoy Door County but a lot of people have been unhappy lately because service is slow or business are closed because of staffing issues. I’m not trying to be harsh I’m just trying to be real and eye opening.,t2_d2wauw1i,neomanotneomi,0,1627325636.0,0,t1_h6m94cb,h6m94cb,False,BelgianBillie,t3_os155k,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/os155k/thinking_of_buying_a_vacation_home_should_it_be/,Thinking of buying a vacation home.

"We've been up to DC for a few anniversaries, as well as a few dozen other times.

I'm hard pressed to give a place that's a ""tourist trap"" .. perhaps the most popular place is Al Johnson's for breakfast, but I wouldn't avoid there, it's a great experience.  

Try Al Johnson's or White Gull Inn for breakfast.   Wilson's in Ephraim is a 1950s style diner for lunch.  

Chop is our go-to for anniversary dinner.  Great patio top view of Sister Bay.

Shopping is tough, not knowing your likings, but both my wife and I love the store On Deck (in Fish Creek and Sister Bay.)    There's plenty of markets/orchards, they're all quality.  If you want some levity, go to Seaquist Orchards market .. and spend a few minutes in their (free) rope maze next to the parking lot.   

Walks?  Everywhere.  Make sure you tour Peninsula State Park and hit the new Eagle Tower.   I'd also recommend the Eagle Trail (starts near the tower) which is marked ""difficult"" and it has some tough terrain, but I'm an out of shape 50-something, I did it a few months ago.  Great view.

Consider this art installation in Milwaukee: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Calling\_(di\_Suvero)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calling_(di_Suvero)) . It continues to be resented by a decent chunk of Milwaukeans even though it has sat there for 30 years now. The complaints are similar in nature to those concerning the tower.

In 30 years, should we still be complaining about the tower?

"If downlighting is your thing, you could look into remodel options compatible with it. There are pros out there who specialize in fancy lighting for broken surfaces. This link has contact info for one of them: [https://www.clevelandrestoration.org/projects/steeple-lighting](https://www.clevelandrestoration.org/projects/steeple-lighting)

In this setting, large unbroken flat surfaces look industrial (a commentator from the original post cited [brutalism](https://mymodernmet.com/brutalist-architecture/)). It isn't just this tower that people have been complaining about; there are residential neighbors to Bay Ship who have a similar concern. Bay Ship's recent expansion plans ran into a roadblock with their neighbors.

Another issue is analogous to the ""[uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley)"" issue. The tower is just close enough to a historical lighthouse to generate certain expectations about its appearance. The current appearance rests in the ""uncanny valley"" somewhere between a lighthouse and an industrial building.

Additionally, [kitsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch) art is out of fashion currently. Think of how the [coffee pot](https://www.roadsideamerica.com/tip/17077) no longer has a woman inside dressed in traditional European garb. If the coffee pot were to be used again, people would take offense at it.

"I'm sure it is fine from the inside... but what can you do to improve the appearance from the outside?

The Welcome to Door County sign is made with dolomite; its local I think. So is the Door County Historical Museum. Could you clad the outside with local dolomite, and extend the observation deck out a little? This would break up the flat surfaces that raised the ire of the people on the other subreddit.

This could be paid for with room tax revenues because it would qualify as ""[tangible municipal development](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/66/vi/0615/1/fm)"". All you'd have to do is come up with a plan and submit it to the county board. They give anyone three minutes to talk at the beginning of a meeting; that would be enough to get the ball rolling on it.

A remodel project involving a facade would be a far better use of money then letting Destination Door County feed it into Google for pay-per click or printing more guides than are used only to recycle them anyway.

(When people from Wisconsin think of a museum addition, they think of this: [http://mam.org/info/calatrava.php](http://mam.org/info/calatrava.php), which cost $122 million. That's a high bar to meet, and not your fault. You only had $7.2 million to work with, and no one can blame you for that, you did what you could afford with it. This doesn't change the problem with the long, flat surfaces, but it makes it more understandable. I think if you explained the circumstances which led you to compromise on exterior aesthetics, the people who run things would be sympathetic and be open to helping you out with room tax revenue. They'd even be more sympathetic if you offered some sort of acknowledgment of the public funding, such as opening the museum and tower for free during the January after the remodel is completed.)",t2_cgz5a6ue,ThrowAway943533,0,1626705434.0,0,t1_h5r93qy,h5r93qy,False,ThrowAway943533,t3_omwry4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/omwry4/this_cheaplooking_lighthouse_at_a_museum_in_door/,"This cheap-looking lighthouse at a museum in Door County, WI.

"Door County has another chance to get it right.

Door County's twelfth lighthouse is on Boyer Bluff at the northwest tip of Washington Island. The Wisconsin DNR tried to buy the 60 or so acres around the lighthouse in the 1970s in order to add it to a combined state park including Rock Island. This was opposed by the town of Washington on the grounds that it would cut into their property tax base and increase the number of visitors to the island.

Since then, Destination Door County (and the same institution by prior names) will not admit that the Boyer Bluff lighthouse exists in their marketing materials. The fear appears to be that discussing the Boyer Bluff lighthouse might encourage the state to go ahead and try to buy the property, probably with some coercive measure such as eminent domain. So to paraphrase Harry Potter it is the ""lighthouse that must not be named"".

Someday, someone with vision might propose using room tax for ""tangible municipal development"" and replacing the TV tower-like lighthouse on Boyer Bluff for a beautiful structure that looks like a lighthouse. That would be a chance to ""get it right"" with beautiful design.

"There is an interesting table on page 19 that says construction laborers in the county do not make enough money to comfortably fit a local apartment rental in their budget. Page 8 attributes the housing shortage in part to shortage of construction industry workers.

[https://www.co.door.wi.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/\_01182021-824](https://www.co.door.wi.gov/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_01182021-824)

It is not uncommon for seasonal construction laborers in rural areas to live in campgrounds where a monthly rental can be arranged. Why they do this makes sense to me after looking at the table.

At the end of the report there is a copy of an application for a grant to turn a school building in Sturgeon Bay into 15 new apartments.

The county recently voted to ask the state to help out with the housing shortage, but in the wrong way. Actually they want the state to pay to put more seniors (aged 60 on up) through APS. So if they end up in nursing homes, that should free up more houses for workers.

 >Door County is the easternmost county in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. As of the 2010 census, the population was 27,785. Its county seat is Sturgeon Bay, making it one of three Wisconsin counties on Lake Michigan not to have a county seat with the same name. Instead it is named after the strait between the Door Peninsula and Washington Island.

">I don't understand the concern on spending room tax dollars on such a visitor center and associated transportation services instead of advertising, unless I'm misunderstanding something.

I've been able to piece apart five factors:

One is that Van Lieshout is representing Sturgeon Bay, where the current visitor center is held. If they built a new visitor center in the northern part of the county, that would leave Sturgeon Bay out of the loop. So Van Lieshout must oppose it.

The second factor is that Jarosh has the most to lose... his job; now that Moneypenny is gone eyes are on him to see if he remains. Does he even want to manage a smaller piece of the pie?

The third factor is that Myles Dannhausen has a conflict of interest due to his position on the Zone while being a co-owner of the Pulse. Likewise, Dave Elliot used his position as chairman of the Baileys Harbor town board to push for the room tax hike. Dannhausen can be assumed to be an ally of Elliot due to their joint publishing work. Earlier this year, a lodging provider suggested in a letter to the Zone that perhaps Elliot resign due to his conflict of interest. (There is still sentiment against Elliot because he was the most vocal person in the media advocating a room tax hike. Note though that Elliot is not currently overseeing the Tourism Zone or Destination Door County.) Exactly how much room tax money flows through to Elliot and/or Dannhausen is unclear. It could be considerable.

The fourth factor are cliques and social networks related to the previous three factors. In media, money is not the only thing that flows. Information and social status also get transferred. People who've made it to the top have a reason to be concerned about changes.

The fifth factor is that some people have insecurities over public sentiment. They feel like money can buy good sentiment, and if money is short good sentiment will be lost, causing bad things to happen. Covid put them short on cash, so Destination Door County needed a room tax hike to raise more cash... only keep forking it over to Google for pay-per-click marketing. Otherwise [doorcounty.com](https://doorcounty.com) might be listed second to [co.door.wi.gov/](https://co.door.wi.gov/) or [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door\_County,\_Wisconsin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_County,_Wisconsin) .

Some pleasant myths out there: That Hjalmar Holand's boosterism a century ago created Door County, that the 1969 ""A Kingdom So Delicious"" put it on the map, and that the *New York Times* and *Cape Cod Times* validate the Cape Cod of the Midwest slogan. Several negative myths are that the 1971 ""Poison in Paradise"" and the 1988 ""Shut the &!@# Door"" were existential threats.

And even if all the myths are true, we live in an internet age where the rules have changed. This is hard to accept for those who were trained heavily with honor and shame when they were little, or whose publicity careers were built off the old model. Two adages which come to mind are that if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and ""Don't believe your own publicity"". But if you work in media maybe you think that unless you succeed, people won't come anymore. (Bultmann addressed this line of thinking with his ""as long as there are people, they will come to Door County"" comment in the pressgazette link.)

In reality, Door County has never enjoyed perfect public sentiment, and never needed it because its not Disneyworld. Someone whose first impression of the county is the official county government website or the wikipedia article could even be more likely to come...even if those websites do not present a 100% perfect image like the fluff pieces in myriad newspapers and magazines subsidized by Destination Door County.

Robillard is from Gardner. She represents people who years back lost some tourist revenue due to the widening of Highway 57. (But they were never so dependent on it in the first place.) Like Van Lieshout she has nothing to gain from a new visitor center in a northern community. Of course the panel also discussed trying to expand tourism in the southern part of the county.

People bring up broadband internet all the time. Doesn't Starlink solve that by the end of 2021 WITHOUT all the expensive utility work?

The affordable housing is the biggest issue in my mind. And I don't like the idea of punishing short term home owners. I would like to see the room fee tax perhaps go towards some affordable housing projects. A nice TIF package that a builder would actually want to consider. Look what ski resorts do for their seasonal and full-time employees that can't afford an expensive home. They have dedicated affordable lodging with nice amenities and attractions.

Tourism is a good problem to have. But it needs to be managed and considered carefully.

"A lot to unpack here.

>""For several years now, there has been increasing division among residents concerning the growing number of tourists, vacationers and visitors coming to Door County.""

Thank you, Captain Obvious.

&#x200B;

>\[Bob Bultman\] said as long as there are people, they will come to Door County, and that the county is turning into the suburbs of Green Bay -- and he doesn't see that going any other way.

I'd argue places like New Franken, Luxemburg, etc., are outpacing Door County in becoming suburbs of Green Bay.  But if this doesn't go any other way, that's largely in part to the likes of the DCEDC and the villages and towns who have for decades put the tourism industry ahead of everything else and resisted efforts to add or expand locally sustainable industries and businesses.  Goode reinforced that with her statement that ""the county has focused on getting tourists... but not on retaining residents.""

Door County has a huge brain drain.  While there are many intelligent people I went to school with still living and working there, there is also a very large number of schoolmates that live elsewhere.  I don't see that changing any time soon so long as the county doesn't have reliable broadband internet access outside of Sturgeon Bay and a few other places, and so long as housing options favor tourists and not long-term residents.

Heise's statement that ""it is selfish to think Door County is at capacity"" is arguably short sighted.  Selfish for who?  Those that rely on the tourism industry, possibly.  But as a native who now lives somewhere else in Wisconsin, it's getting to the point that I don't like going home in the summer to see family because of the hassle from tourists, whether it be traffic, wait times, crowding, etc.  And that's just me as someone who doesn't live there anymore.  I can only imagine how much worse it is for full-time residents.

&#x200B;

>Susan Kennedy... suggested... educating tourists.  
>  
>Heise said educating tourists on how to be good stewards of the land could help manage the impacts.

Educating tourists?  The same tourists who disregard road signs, disrespect private property, and cause environmental damage by doing things like building cairns?

&#x200B;

>Solomon Lindenberg... emphasized that overtourism isn't just an issue of wanting fewer people around or the county losing its ""quaintness,"" but rather the effect of it on labor, housing, culture and the environment.

I'd love to hear more from this guy, because he seems to understand how all the moving parts fit together.  Without a labor force coming from local full-time residents, employers have to look elsewhere.  But without adequate housing and wages, non-residents are reluctant to take jobs there when there are better opportunities elsewhere.  When I was younger and still living in the area, there were some places, especially in northern Door County, that brought workers in, but the core workforce of many tourist businesses was made up of local teenagers, arguably because at least one of their parents had reliable jobs at one of the shipyards or at one of the places in the industrial park.

&#x200B;

>""I fear at times we replace the quality for quantity.""

Another Captain Obvious.

&#x200B;

>A roadblock he sees in doing this, however, is disappointing local residents by drawing attention to the county's ""secret beaches"" and destinations they enjoy.

On the nose.  Even in this subreddit, when people ask about things to do or see, there are some places I rarely mention or don't mention at all.

The idea of a bus or other transportation service from some kind of visitor center could ease not just parking but traffic, I think.  I understand a general concern for how room tax money is spent, but beyond mitigating the risk of legal issues on how the money is spent, I don't understand the concern on spending room tax dollars on such a visitor center and associated transportation services instead of advertising, unless I'm misunderstanding something.

&#x200B;

>One issue Goode hears about often is with location and design in development, but creating county-wide design standards would be difficult, ""because the towns don't agree about what they do and don't like,"" she said.

All the more reason to try to get everyone to the table and come up with some kind of county-wide zoning and development framework.  At least that way everyone can (maybe) come to some kind of agreement or compromise before either (1) someone like the County Board comes up with something no one likes or (2) the whole tourism thing falls apart because everyone was doing their own thing and businesses can't find workers because no one wants to live or work there anymore.

I agree with u/sand24man about a trolley or bus service.

I went to a few times in 2020, including Jan 1.  Just like you said, as soon as you get to Sturgeon Bay, coverage drops to zero.     At that time, if you looked at Visible's coverage map, it would say ""No coverage.""

Every time Visible would send me a survey, I'd complain that DC might not have a big population, but is a huge tourist area that will create many unhappy Visible customers if there's no coverage.  

Sometime in Jan/Feb 2021, their coverage map changed and suggested 4G coverage.   I was there in March and .. no signal.

My wife uses Tracfone with Verizon towers .. and she has coverage all over DC.  I think what's happening is Visible doesn't have agreements for roaming other networks -- although their map says they (now) do.

"So .. I can only speak for myself, and I've now owned my unit for only a few weeks. -- But they gave me 4 years of booking data for my unit, so I have a lot of numbers.

I created a spreadsheet taking in to account each of the 12 months, the HOA fees, electricity, taxes, cleaning fees, capital requests, and the predicted bookings based on the previous 4 years' data.  (Smoothing out the pandemic data, of course.)  June-August are nearly booked 100%, whereas January is maybe 10% booked.

After all expenses, roughly if we never used the unit, allowing max bookings, the net income was over $5k a year.

I did another ""max usage"" scenario where I used it 18 days in the ""high season"" and then used it exclusively from November-May (so no one else would be booking it.)  This also tagged in visiting it 30 times (there's a $75 cleaning fee for each visit).    The net income was still over $1k, and I very much doubt it'll be used 30x (between myself and friends.)

Even if I'm off by double, it's still generating some cash with max usage.  I'm expecting something in the middle, like $3k for the year -- which is all gravy.

Obvious caveats, every condo resort would have different figures, revenue, expenses.  I didn't factor any loan interest as I paid cash.   

As for limits, there are a few.  You can't book your unit for 30 consecutive days (basically, you can't live there.)   There's a $75 cleaning fee every time you visit.   Some holidays (4th of July, etc) have 3 night mins.

One other surprise rule that seems common at other condos .. you can allow friends to use the place .. but you are limited to six friends that you list each year.   When it's winter, I'd love to let my friends use the place .. I'd love to bump into someone random and give them access, but .. you have to pick 6 only.  -- (You can give anyone a 50% discount though, which gives up your rental income.)

So, anyway, that's been our journey to date.  I might be wrong, it seems too good to be true, but I'm pretty good with spreadsheets .. relatively confident in the prediction .. at absolutely worst, it's break-even.",t2_5fbba,duncantuna,0,1623423539.0,0,t1_h1ere33,h1ere33,False,[deleted],t3_n1b4eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/n1b4eu/has_anyone_been_successful_in_acquiring_a/,has anyone been successful in acquiring a property in Door County within the past ~12 months?,/r/DoorCounty/comments/n1b4eu/has_anyone_been_successful_in_acquiring_a/h1ere33/,1,r/DoorCounty,0,1

"Funding could be both/and rather than either/or.

The long-run difficulty is that the overall cost in government services (police calls, CPS calls and school for the kids, plus the usual infrastructure) outstrips whatever you get back in property taxes.

Since Door County is the only county in Wisconsin which has both a high per-capita cost of government and lacks a larger permanent low-income population, what should we expect once you expand the year-round low-income population? Even larger government expenditures. Because of this TIF might not be the best way to go for this because it of how it prevents the local governments from receiving tax revenue. The money aspect would tend to anger existing residents, who resent subsidizing others' lifestyle. This anger could contribute to problematic behaviors, which are explained below. Federal funding though? Absolutely. Room tax? If it can be arranged.

Another element is whether the housing project would just become a honeytrap for CPSing the residents.  For Kewaunee County, using 1 - ( 1 - (0.009104752)\*.65 ) \^ 18) = 0.101, it follows that 10.1% of the children can expect to have their parent(s) found guilty (indicated or substantiated) of child maltreatment sometime before they turn 18, assuming that 65% of screened-in reports are indicated or substantiated, one child per report, and that the 2019 rate of screened-in reports persists indefinitely. For Door County, that turns to 1 - ( 1 - (0.023282195)\*.65 ) \^ 18)  = 24.0%

The long decimal string in each formula is the number of annual screened in reports per child in each county. All of this is for 2019 figures of CPS activity and minor-aged population. In recent months though screened-in reports have been way up.. 78 from January 1st through June 8th, compared to 35 during the same stretch in 2020 and 31 in 2019. If it interests you as much as it does me, you can look up figures at [https://dcf.wisconsin.gov/dashboard/access](https://dcf.wisconsin.gov/dashboard/access) .

The 24.0% reflects a higher amount of xenophobia and a more broken down community structure in Door County compared to Kewaunee County. As I understand it, there are both more genuinely messed-up families and more disgruntled random strangers, neighbors, or professionals who are filing reports with questionable motives in Door County than in Kewaunee County.

Building a housing projects is going to lead some people see fresh meat; all these new families to file CPS reports about. And then the county must bear the costs of doing home inspections and interviews, and removing the children or placing the parent(s) on a child welfare plan and the children in therapy. Then the building the housing project gets blamed for all this, stymieing more such projects.

The current approach of making life so hard on lower-income workers that many don't stay and raise families here is perhaps the kinder approach than inviting them to stay, only to put their children in the 24%.

The second worst county in Wisconsin for 2019 per-capita screened in reports is Burnett County. 1 - ( 1 - (0.06340996)\*.65 ) \^ 18)= 53%.  So if this current rate keeps up, roughly half of all children can expect to have their parent(s) indicated or substantiated for child maltreatment. (Both mean guilty, but substantiated is worse.) The worst off county is Menominee County, which fits with the high level of poverty on the res. But Burnett County does not have that bad of a poverty level; when per-capita screened-in reports are taken as a function of poverty Burnett County is an outlier all by itself. Nor was this some sort of fluke because the number of screened in reports has been stable in Burnett County for some years now; for 2020, if you figure it using the 2020 screened in reports and the 2019 population, you get 48%, which is almost as bad as the 53% in 2019.

What is wrong with Burnett County? It is a more rural county that is close enough to the Twin Cities to pick up on some of the economic benefit which comes with exurbia, and also the drug traffic. Like with Door County they are dependent on net migration to support their population level. They also rely on tourism for a decent chunk of their economy. Similar to Door County, tourism is smaller in importance to them than manufacturing.

The mix of high and low incomes, new and old blood, and suburban and rural values will get you the sort of culture war which puts children right in the middle of it. Not fair to them, it would be better to live somewhere stable and safe. Developing new housing projects could contribute to Door County becoming more like Burnett County.

A example of the sort of worker housing that won't anger the existing population are the cherry industry labor housing facilities: [https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-101914-093218/unrestricted/Farm\_Labor\_\_IQP\_Report.pdf](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-101914-093218/unrestricted/Farm_Labor__IQP_Report.pdf) If you search the link for ""Door County"" you can find them listed. The workers come and then go; local school districts are not responsible for their children, and if ICE stays away they are unlikely to require government services. Local taxpayers are not worse off for having them here and tax credits were not needed to build them. Instead the employers take care of them in a way that doesn't make anyone jealous about their lifestyle.",t2_cgz5a6ue,ThrowAway943533,0,1623211018.0,0,t1_h143fqh,h143fqh,False,Brainrants,t3_nqjmsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/nqjmsl/is_door_county_full_zoom_panel_to_discuss_tourist/,Is Door County full?

"What if room taxes could be directed into an account which would provide a subsidy to developers and builders to develop properties available for Algoma-sized rents?

Would this even be legal? The [Wisconsin state code involved](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/66/VI/0615) says

(fm) “Tourism promotion and tourism development"" means any of the following that are significantly used by transient tourists and reasonably likely to generate paid overnight stays at more than one establishment on which a tax under sub. (1m) (a) may be imposed, that are owned by different persons and located within a municipality in which a tax under this section is in effect; or, if the municipality has only one such establishment, reasonably likely to generate paid overnight stays in that establishment:

1. Marketing projects, including advertising media buys, creation and distribution of printed or electronic promotional tourist materials, or efforts to recruit conventions, sporting events, or motorcoach groups.
2. Transient tourist informational services.
3. Tangible municipal development, including a convention center.

I'm not a lawyer, but I think affordable housing could count as #3. The question is whether such housing could be ""reasonably likely to generate paid overnight stays"". Probably only if the occupants were actively involved in working tourist related jobs, which might be tricky to implement.

[Sunshine tax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_tax) is not an injustice perpetrated on anyone, but the question is how to account for it and minimize its ill effects.

"A TIF district involving new construction will take at the minimum three years to accept new residents because these things take time. In the meantime, should the county get back to APSing 392 people a year? And how are they going to do that? Are you going to volunteer for meals-on-wheels?

It doesn't have to be a massive drop in value across the board to fill the need for workforce housing; just enough motivated sellers. Senior citizen homeowners who are APSed into nursing homes may become motivated sellers depending on the circumstances. Legal regulations [are complicated](https://www.seniorplanning.org/long-term-care-medicaid-eligibility/wisconsin/), and provide some protection from the nursing home taking the house. Only one house can be protected, if the senior owns two houses he or she must chose which one to protect. For many it comes down to the preference of whoever manages their accounts. It isn't really a secret though that houses can become vacant when elderly go to nursing homes, and that those vacant houses eventually get occupied again one way or another. One way or another it happens, and APS can speed up the process.

which used 2001 survey results. That was before things were online so much. If you support shifting some of the room tax, maybe you will find an opportunity to advocate in that direction someday. The 30% share allocated to municipalities is politically more vulnerable to shifting. The Wisconsin Lotto says that ""You don't have to play to win"" because of how the revenue is directed towards tax relief.

"Until the APS can get back up to 2019 or higher in their number of annual referrals, converting AirBnBs is the quickest way to solve the problem. New construction (even affordable) takes time. APS opened up new houses every year, but then 2020 messed it up.

&#x200B;

""how many locals would be able to afford those houses anyways""

They would need to drop in value a lot like the Sur la Baie mansion did.

&#x200B;

""for a landlord to make any money off renting that house, the monthly rent is going to be insanely high""

Once prices everywhere fall and show no sign of recovering in the future, those who bought in for investment purposes will sell, even at a loss. Working people or landlords would buy up the newly-affordable properties and either live in them or rent them out at reasonable rates.

""Door County Room Taxes brought in 5.1 MILLION in 2019.""

The bulk of the room taxes is spent on advertising. In Wisconsin it is allowed (& sometimes done) to direct room tax money to fund infrastructure used by both tourists and residents. Door County has failed to do this. A typical ROI of good, effective advertising is 5x. If this is the case for the room tax funded advertising, then its impact is 5x of $5.1 million or only $26.5 million. Really it is less though because some is spent on salaries, public car chargers, etc., but $26.5 million is still useful as a ballpark figure.

If Destination Door County and the municipalities receiving shared room tax revenue stopped advertising to tourists today, the number of visitors would drop, but the drop would be less than the drop caused by coronavirus. It would be bearable. Direct visitor spending in 2019 was  $304.2 million ( [https://www.doorcounty.com/media/18701/2020-door-county-toursim-economic-impact-fact-sheet-web.pdf](https://www.doorcounty.com/media/18701/2020-door-county-toursim-economic-impact-fact-sheet-web.pdf) ) . Losing $26.5 million is only an 8.7% loss. The drop in 2020 compared to 2019 was $61.8 million, a 17% loss from coronavirus.

From the research publications out there, the most important thing for a Destination Management agency or Tourism Zone to do is to answer individual inquiries. Most prospective tourists do not decide where to visit because of the ads or media placements. It is enough instead that people know a place is recognized as a tourist destination. Once this is accomplished, additional advertising is unnecessary.

In my opinion, that $5.1 million per year would do a lot more good if 70% went to the county highway department and the municipalities used the remaining 30% for their own infrastructure. In 2021 the highway department had a budget of $22,657,558. An additional $3.57 million (the 70%) could be put to good use or displace existing funding for use elsewhere.",t2_cgz5a6ue,ThrowAway943533,0,1622831318.0,0,t1_h0li5tu,h0li5tu,False,Brainrants,t3_nqjmsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/nqjmsl/is_door_county_full_zoom_panel_to_discuss_tourist/,Is Door County full?

"The question is whether the long-term impact of over-speculation can be reversed. Even fancy houses can fall in price and someday become affordable. An example of the sort of price change that would be needed to make all new construction unnecessary can be seen in the decline in value of the Sur la Baie manion in Liberty Grove. It sold for about $20 million in 2019 but only $2.7 million in 2016. This was a decline in value of about 92.6%. More on Sur la Baie:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4h9V3OGDNU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4h9V3OGDNU)

[http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/ellison-bay-mansion-largest-in-wisconsin-is-sold-b99711108z1-376570171.html](http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/ellison-bay-mansion-largest-in-wisconsin-is-sold-b99711108z1-376570171.html)

If all the currently unaffordable properties declined in price by 92.6%, there would be enough affordable properties for the working class. 92.6% seems unrealistic though absent more coercive measures. In order to get properties to fall in value, you need motivated sellers. What would make older people sell the homes they live in, even seasonally? Adult Protective Services can get elderly people into court-ordered nursing home placements.

From 2007 to 2019, Door County APS referrals increased from 61 to 392. This is an average increase of 53.6% every year over 12 years. There are only 8435 people 65 and older, with roughly 2489 people from 60-65.

8435+2489 = 10,924 residents old enough to be accountable to APS.

10,924/392 = 3.36% the 10,924 elderly are APSed in any given year

The current life expectancy for a person in Wisconsin aged 60-65 is 24.1 additional years ( [https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/stats/life-expectancy.htm](https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/stats/life-expectancy.htm) ).

1 - ( 1 - 0.0336 ) \^ 24.1 = 58.6% of elderly Door County residents of the age of 60 can be expected to get APSed sometime within remaining lifetime, should the enforcement rate return to and stay at 2019 levels.

0.586\*10,924 = is 6401 residents. That can only be a ballpark type figure because the number of elderly changes each year. But using it anyway, if even only 20% of the APSed residents get sent to a nursing home that would be 1280 residents over 24.1 years. Most of these are homeowners. Dividing it out by year that means removing 53 elderly residents each year for the next 24.1 years. At least as many working age adults could live in their old houses.

The problem is that the elderly community meal stations were shut down, leading to a steep drop in 2020 APS referrals since this is the main way the social services department caught elderly who are self-neglecting or otherwise maltreated. So because of the coronavirus impact there aren't enough houses newly emptied of their elderly around for younger workers to move into anymore.

So this is where it makes sense to get some of the AirBnBs to convert to rental housing for workers. 60 houses is a start. If Sevestapol curbs short term rentals, maybe other communities will follow in a few years. Possible the county as a whole could do something about it too. Or if not maybe re-opened community meal sites will solve the problem by getting more elderly out of their homes.

Sounds kind of heartless doesn't it. Wish it weren't so. Other counties that don't have such a housing shortage like Kewaunee County and Brown County had (as of 2019) considerably lower APS rates as a percentage of their total population. People who are 60 or older and afraid of being moved to an old peoples' home could live there and be a lot safer from APS that way.",t2_cgz5a6ue,ThrowAway943533,0,1622830323.0,0,t1_h0lfht8,h0lfht8,False,Brainrants,t3_nqjmsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/nqjmsl/is_door_county_full_zoom_panel_to_discuss_tourist/,Is Door County full?

"The tipping point is also a social one. An unhealthy community either won't support new families forming, or will drive out existing ones. When people don't expect the community will support the next generation, there won't be a next generation. Or it will be stunted.

This is already happening, see [https://www.wbay.com/2021/05/17/interview-door-countys-drug-problem/](https://www.wbay.com/2021/05/17/interview-door-countys-drug-problem/) , an interview which followed up after the County Health and Human Services Chair posted a cry for help on her facebook page because of a large increase in screened-in CPS reports: [https://www.facebook.com/mklundahl/posts/10157859746191160](https://www.facebook.com/mklundahl/posts/10157859746191160)

From her comments it appears that 3/4 of the families investigated had the children removed from their homes, this was necessary because someone in the home was using hard drugs. There is concern that so many children will eventually be taken that the county won't be able to pay for it.

Adult Protective Services complaints were way lower (115) in 2020 than in 2019 (392) because the community meals stations were closed much of the year. Most of the complaints involve self-neglect, but sizable number of them end up in court-ordered care placements. When coronavirus measures end, it is reasonable to assume that the number will continue to climb again because the community meal stations will open up again.

In the Calhoun rodent utopia experiments, what made the rats and mice mentally ill and violent was that they were subjected to too much social interactions. Each experiment reached a social tipping point beyond which they could not raise new broods. They could not control for feeling overwhelmed by retreating somewhere private. Traffic can be part of that, racism can be part of that, socio-economic strains can be part of that, inadequate housing can be part of that, getting sick from bad groundwater can be part of that.

What makes Door County unique is that the local government is especially funded by taxes paid by seasonal residents and visitors. Most local governments need to help their population in order to prosper, but the County of Door's pocketbook is more immune to whatever ails its population. And many types of residents require more in services than what they pay in taxes anyway, so it is actually good for the budget to replace the population with AirBnBs taking up the housing and CAFOs taking up the land. Getting past the tipping point can pay pretty well if you are positioned to benefit from it.

What keeps this from happening? People like Meghan Lundal, who value a community of people.

"What's the criteria for ""too busy""?

I can think of 4, but feel free to add:

1. Traffic
2. Parking
3. Bar/Restaurant wait-times
4. Entertainment wait-times (golfing, bike rental, bowling, whatever.)

Now .. entertainment is not mandatory, i.e., if you don't want to wait for a tee time, don't golf that day.   If you can't get tickets to Northern Sky, try again tomorrow.

Bars and restaurants .. yeah, that's a bummer.   But .. you might not want to eat at 5pm, but there's an answer.  Or make your own.  

Parking is problematic, but it's all about a mindset.   If we have to park and walk 10 minutes, it's terrible .. but is it really?   If you had to wait just 10 minutes for a dinner table, you'd be thrilled.    (Obviously, handicapped parking is an issue.)

Traffic .. same thoughts.  Festival traffic notwithstanding, I think I'd say Fish Creek has the worst traffic issue, mainly due to the 42-turn intersection.   -- But I've driven through there in what would be called awful traffic .. and it's about +5 extra minutes.  

Yeah, going up or down 42/57 arriving or departing can have thick traffic, so instead of going 70 it's 45.  It's annoying but .. outrageous?

"> FISH CREEK - Are too many tourists vacationing in Door County? 
> 
> The Door County Environmental Council has set a Zoom meeting for June 9 to discuss ""Overtourism and the Capacity of Door County"" after ""increasing discussion among residents"" concerning the number of visitors to the county, according to the environmental council's president, Mike Bahrke. 
> 
> In a press release Tuesday, Bahrke noted ""many Door County natives and locals have become more outspoken in their opposition to what they consider to be over development and loss of the 'Old Door County'” and asked if the county was approaching a tipping point. The council's mission, he wrote, is to preserve and protect the county's natural beauty and resources. 
> 
> ""Proponents of development here in Door County argue that more business and development bring more needed jobs and more money to Door County,"" he wrote. ""Relatedly, others add that we should not rely so much on tourism, that we need diversification, affordable housing, and increased sustainability.""
> 
> The panel discussion will feature Bob Bultman, Ryan Heise, Susan Kennedy, Solomon Lindenberg, Steve Eatough, Mariah Goode and Jon Jarosh, and can be accessed via a link on the council's website, [dcec-wi.org](dcec-wi.org).
> 
> The talk will begin at 7 p.m., and is open to the public. A question and answer session will follow the discussion, and questions can be sent in ahead of time to contact@dcec-wi.org.",t2_hoah3,Brainrants,0,1622633411.0,0,t1_h0avr6q,h0avr6q,True,Brainrants,t3_nqjmsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/nqjmsl/is_door_county_full_zoom_panel_to_discuss_tourist/,Is Door County full?

"I recently realized there was another reason for the housing shortage along with the AirBnBs: it is because the county Adult Protective Services is used to move elderly people (aged 60 and up) into nursing homes. The main way they generate new referrals/complaints (mostly alleging self-neglect) are the community meal sites for the elderly. This was a really effective strategy and gave the Door County APS some of the highest per-capita referral/complaint figures in the state.

These meal sites were closed early last spring due to coronavirus. Since then Adult Protective Services activity in the county has been way down from what it used to be in 2019. So now there are less elderly in nursing homes and more elderly taking up housing that would otherwise be bought or rented by working age people.

[I looked at some of the statistics involved with Door County's Adult Protective Services in another thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/nqjmsl/is_door_county_full_zoom_panel_to_discuss_tourist/h0lfht8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

This is my previous comment:[https://doorcountypulse.com/all-str-eyes-are-on-sevastopol/](https://doorcountypulse.com/all-str-eyes-are-on-sevastopol/)

It is because thousands of what would otherwise be rental houses for workers or retirees have been turned into AirBnBs (& etc.) for tourists. There aren't enough apartments for all the would-be renters who are prevented from renting houses.

There are so many AirBnBs now they can't even fill them all. Some are owned by LLCs or people out-of-state and may be sort of an investment thing. There is a lot of money out there and if you are afraid of inflation Door County real estate is one place to park that money. Short-term rentals are a way to get some money out of the real-estate speculation. Even if they lose some money on AirBnBing they may still overall come ahead with the speculation when they sell in 10 or 20 years or whenever.

So you can't find an apartment because of a lot of complicated factors that have been going on for some time now. Things may change; if you see the link maybe some communities will curb the AirBnBing and so workers can rent instead.",t2_cgz5a6ue,ThrowAway943533,0,1622585945.0,0,t1_h08u03a,h08u03a,True,Coolwalsh,t3_nmrnc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/nmrnc9/whats_with_almost_no_availability_for_apartments/,What's with almost no availability for apartments?,/r/DoorCounty/comments/nmrnc9/whats_with_almost_no_availability_for_apartments/h08u03a/,4,r/DoorCounty,0,4

"You mention outdoor seating and live music .. for Friday or Saturday, I'd aim for Sister Bay which I think has the best 'night life'.  The Husby's area has outdoor seating and live music.   Chop and Boathouse have great upstairs patios overlooking the water.  Not to mention Stabbur, Al Johnson's huge outdoor bar/games area. 

I've rented a pontoon several times -- but only for 2 hours, which is perfect.  I would bet Memorial Day won't have weather in the 80s.  Four hours on a pontoon when it's 60 and breezy might gather some complaints.

You have a lot of time in Sister Bay on Sunday .. here's some extra time killers:  Al Johnson's for breakfast, but then drive north.  It's a pretty drive to the ferry terminal, and you'll hit the famous windy road.  There's a beach up there to walk around, plus a visitor center.    Then go back south and stop at Seaquist Orchard/Market.   The market is great, but take 10 minutes and have a race through the (free) large rope maze next to the parking lot, see which of you is the smartest.

I would be remiss in not plugging PC Junction and the winery next door, Stone's Throw.  Yeah, PCJ is aimed at kids, but adults can kill hours too in the outdoor campus.  Good place for lunch.

One comment about DC and your schedule .. you can get tired of all the driving around.   Egg Harbor to Sister Bay is 27 minutes, so round trip you've driven an hour.    i.e., you might want to skip that additional big breakfast at the White Gull Inn, although I've heard the cherry stuffed french toast is amazing.",t2_5fbba,duncantuna,0,1620937595.0,0,t1_gy0rst1,gy0rst1,True,[deleted],t3_nb6zls,https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorCounty/comments/nb6zls/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/DoorCounty/comments/nb6zls/deleted_by_user/gy0rst1/,1,r/DoorCounty,0,1

"If you’re staying in egg harbor I recommend walking around the Main Street shops. Eating at bagels and beignets (next to fireside) and checking out pink bakery for cupcakes, bread or sweets. 

If you’re talking about Gibraltar Grill I believe they’re closed permanently, it’s been up for sale for some time and no ones been in to start reopening it. I recommend the old post office in Ephraim. They have their own waterfront area to sit on. Plus fish boils. 

A few more places I recommend: DC chocolate design in fish creek for delicious chocolate, blue horse café in fish creek for breakfast, fat belly bowls in sister bay if you like burritos. Wood orchard market in egg harbor for pies, fudge, outdoor and indoor decor, plus cider. Lautenbachs has amazing apple cider donuts and door County souvenirs, as well as wine tasting.  Koepsels farm market in baileys harbor has some great canned jam, butters, pickles, etc. They also have amazing soaps.

"First Choice Fishing Charters in Baileys has a waiting list for individuals/mixed groups. You call them they put your name down and as soon as they have 4 people who are interested they call to book the dates with you. I wanna say its $150-$200 for a mixer/5hr trip. They go for big salmon & trout out on lake Michigan. Really amazing crew. We had Capt. Steve and first mate Krisz, they seriously knew those waters and really made sure everything was set and ready to go for us. Krisz even cut up our salmon and bagged it up for us, beautifully might I add and free of charge. I've taken multiple summer trips with them and this past year I did a lawyer ice fishing trip with Krisz, another great experience. Their sister business is Lakeshore Adventures in Baileys that is also the office you go to for payment its just across the street from the Marina. The office opens Memorial Weekend I believe.
