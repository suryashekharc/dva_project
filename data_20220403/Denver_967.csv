 >The Camden County Police Department (CCPD) is a county police department providing law enforcement services to the city of Camden, Camden County, New Jersey, formed in 2013. It is the successor to the Camden Police Department. Then-chief Scott Thomson used the disbanding and replacement to transform the department's policies. Camden's new department has been called ""a model"" of how to reform police departments.

The police barely sent a police report to the insurance company, they did almost nothing except take a statement and send a notification that I had, indeed, been an accident, at least according to me. What a fucking waste of taxpayer money and time. And when they did catch the asshole who stole my car and his equally trashy female partner in crime? They let them out on a personal recognizance bond because ""he might catch COVID in prison,"" as if that was an excuse to let somebody who had committed several other auto thefts in the last month out of jail.

"And I think you fail to understand how much people do pay attention. If the person riding those prototypes stop anywhere near a group of other riders, the other riders will more than likely notice what is clearly not an average road bike. Anyone riding that 50 miles is going to want to stop at a bathroom, or get out of the weather if it's too rough. And if it's a one of a kind chainless drive train, it's entirely possible that the tools to maintain it aren't even available outside of the shop that made the bike, meaning that chopping them would be pointless. Also, as I stated in my first post, random Nike thieves wouldn't know about that shop, only competitors and bike nerds. I'm not sitting here saying everyone is going to notice those two most expensive bikes, but other riders will notice them if they get close enough to see there's no chain, and that adds to risk of getting caught, period.

"It sounds like that poster is like most of us, someone who is tired of living in fear of the criminal element that is roaming the streets and destroying our quality of life with no repercussions.  I can’t afford a new Catalytic Converter if mine is stolen.  Many people can’t afford to replace it.  If my car is totaled or what not I may not be able to get to work.  If I lose my job, I lose my apartment, my healthcare, and I am screwed.  For many people, this is a potential attack on their livelihoods, especially if they drive for a living like Uber or Lyft or a delivery service.  I don’t want to end up homeless because someone else decided to steal from me.

Mother’s Day is usually the marker for turning on sprinklers (and planting freeze intolerant things like tomatoes).

For a new house, I’d suggest getting a sprinkler pro to come out and turn them on for you.  That way you can learn about what you’ve got (be there and ask a lot of questions), and if there are any issues they can address them ASAP.

"The type of sprinklers you have will dramatically alter necessary frequency and duration for watering. Some sprinklers are meant to spray a small amount of water over a longer time. Others push out a ton of water in a short time. 

You should mow at least once a week, but might need to do more in spring. The key is to avoid letting the grass too tall and then cutting it short. This shocks the grass and will kill it. Ideally, you should never cut off more than 1/3 of the grass height in a single mow. 

I recommend aerating it in the spring/now. Denver Lawn Aeration has a convenient and reliable online booking platform.

I when I arrived back in the US a few years ago I was standing in FedEx. This guy comes in with a cart of them. Asked him about it and he said it was a good business. Pulls them the off junk d cars.

"This is terrible advice. The rule of thumb for watering an established lawn is, “water as deeply and as *infrequently* as possible.” 

OP, you can't know how long to run your system until you know at what rate it is delivering water. To do this put some empty containers around the yard and run the system for a set length of time, then measure the depth of the water in the containers. Using that measurement calculate how long you have to run the system to put down 0.5 inches of water at a time. In spring and fall run it long enough to put down that 0.5 inches twice a week, for a total of one inch per week. In the hottest part of summer do it three time a week for a total of 1.5 inches per week. Adjust this as necessary based on supplemental rainfall.

"Don’t turn it on yet. General rule of thumb is Mother’s Day. Mine usually turn off for the season late Sept or early October. I don’t like scrambling to do a blowout if there is a surprise cold snap. Just pay attention to the 10 day forecast in the fall. 

Don’t run them every day. Every other day is good for like 4-6 min per zone. Mine go for 2 min, cycle through and then another 2 min. Some say 2 days a week is good using a 7 minute cycle/14 min total. In my yard that caused a lot of run off so seemed like a waste. Summer time drought might need more time.

"Going through life right now can be very scary and unsettling when we are making the transition away from alcohol to sobriety. Whether or not you’re committed to staying sober, you need to be sober during this period of time you are in court appointed sobriety classes. It is obviously in your best interest to get out of the court system as quickly as possible and will be the cheapest for you in the long run. Take all the advice you hear from everyone in the court system with a grain of salt, much like common knowledge, a lot of it strays from the actual reality we will find in life.

First off, I’m going to give you the answer on how to stay sober. Despite whatever you hear from anyone parroting anything at a class, from a billboard, or anecdotally, you need to understand that sobriety is a choice. Alcoholism is not a disease in the traditional sense that anyone can catch it, it is a choice. The choices that you have made, have made you dependent on alcohol. Those choices were yours and yours alone. Now that you understand this, here’s the truth will set you free: You are the only person in control of your life, and if you fix the things in your life that are making you unhappy, you will not feel the need to turn to alcohol for relief. It really is that fucking simple. There is a reason why 85% of all people who get their first DUI WILL get a second DUI. It’s because they stopped drinking, but they didn’t fix any of the other shit in their lives that drove them to drinking, so they go back to drinking when life gets too fucking hard again.

That’s it Dawg, I literally just saved you weeks of classes, many years of searching for it, and handed you the winning fucking lottery ticket. If you actually will be honest with yourself, and change your life by getting away from the things that make you unhappy, no matter who you are or how much you love them, staying sober is as easy as fucking breathing. Focus on the things that are important in life, like your spouse and kid, or if you’re single and have no kids, cut yourself off from all your old friends for a while, go find new ones that don’t drink, and then come back to your old friends to see that most of them weren’t actually your friends they were just your drinking buddies, and reestablish non-drinking boundaries with your friends that you do you want to keep that are not going to make you drink, and if that’s too much for you to handle, just cut everyone off and make new friends that don’t drink, or who don’t make drinking their primary activity or #1 hangout accessory. 

Does your job make you drink because it’s too fucking stressful and you hate them? Quit your fucking job and go do something else that doesn’t make you wanna drink alcohol. Do your friends stress you out because they’re always asking you bullshit that pisses you off and making your life inconvenient so you want to go have a drink after you see your best friend? Cut them out, they’re not your friends, or at least not good enough to be more than acquaintances. Are there members of your family will you just can’t fucking stand, and stress you out every time you see them text you? Block them, and tell them to fuck off for three months. Do you hate the place you live at whether it’s your apartment, house, or city? Then you need to work on fucking moving as quickly as possible and make it your number one drive in life is to get away from where you’re at. As soon as you can afford it, fucking move. Whatever it is, you have to understand that the things that are stressing you out are stressing you out because YOU are allowing them to. You are a free human being that can do whatever the fuck you want, any situation that is stressing you out is one of your choosing. Put yourself in a better situation, relieve the stress that you are under, and all of a sudden drinking doesn’t even enter into your mind because you’re not looking for that release.

It may sound unsurmountable, you may think you can’t do it, but I believe in you even though I don’t know you, just like I believe in every other person because they have the same strength inside of them to want better. You are very wise to stay away from religious-based alcohol treatments, as they only want to enslave you by shackling you to your sin and your disease in order to control you and just take your fucking money. A lot of these programs that are secular-based listed on this thread are great places to start, but ultimately it all starts with you and it will all end with you. I gave you the answer, forget all the other bullshit you hear, take responsibility for yourself, and the choices you make, and you will have no problem setting yourself free. You can do this.",t2_jijmfogc,NoLightOnMe,0,1648995550.0,0,t1_i384sq5,i384sq5,True,dankestwallaby,t3_tuy0cq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/tuy0cq/please_advise_re_aa/,Please advise re: AA,/r/Denver/comments/tuy0cq/please_advise_re_aa/i384sq5/,1,r/Denver,0,1

"How much time and money is worth one life? 2000 catalytic converters have been stolen since 2020 in Denver alone, meaning at least $2M has been stolen. Most people don’t make $2M in their lifetime.

Sum up the time and money and we have collectively lost more than a lifetime and a life’s savings. Shouldn’t the thieves be subject to the same losses?

These thieves contribute nothing and cost us everything. They take your time and resources by force, and then compete with you to buy goods and services with their stolen money, driving your costs higher. When you have a parasite, you kill it, you don’t spare it because “that’s a life.”

"This will never be solved with more police, cameras, or anything like that. Only way to solve theft is to address the cause.

Step 1: Properly funded asylums for drug addicts and the intentionally homeless.

Step 2: End for-profit housing. Homes are for living in, not for making a quick buck by exploiting someone else.

Step 3: Universal, tax-funded healthcare paid for by a combination of a simplified and properly enforced corporate tax law, and a wealth cap.

Or... we can keep having our property vandalized, our sidewalks covered in human shit and used needles, and our ""keepers of the peace"" only focused on speeding tickets and killing minorities.

"Wow. Such hostility.  The liberal media ties itself in knots to try to deny that  Trump achieved true energy independence in 2020. The simple fact is that for the full year of 2020, the U.S. became a net exporter of energy for the first time in modern history.  The media tries to ignore this fact and simply point to crude oil imports of which the US has always imported more than it exports.  Then when they want to make Biden look good they switch it up and measure Petroleum  (crude oil + hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGLs) + refined petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel fuel, and biofuels).  Under this measure the US had a substantial import/export surplus under Trump (2020)  and a very slight surplus under Biden (2021).  The liberal media never uses this measure when referring to Trump, but rolls it out to claim Biden has an energy surplus (albeit a very slim one).   So the media focuses on OIL statistics for Trump and Petroleum statistics for Biden. This trickery lets liberals claim that we were net importers under Trump and net exporters under Biden.  It's effective.  Gullible people simply accept this statistical slight of hand.  You did.

Here's a chart that shows Oil, Petroleum and total net import/export data.

"You think a random junkie with a hacksaw/cheap sawzall can easily ship them out of state, wait for a check to come back, then has the ID and desire to go to a bank to cash it? What, they'd have to go get a P.O. Box to get the check if they're homeless? They want to deal in cash, and they want quick turn around.

And it takes money to ship stuff.

Going after the local buyers would ABSOLUTELY reduce the rate of theft from petty opportunists. And if someone more organized starts shipping them out in quantity, it's easier to catch them, too. Some guy is paying cash and filling a box truck to take out of state and sell for more?

"Hey, so let me put this right out here. I had to sit with this comment for a little bit before I could wrap my mind around it. 

Im coming from the perspective I don’t like thieves. I think they’re dicks. I think a lot of them are pushed down into poverty by a system designed to suck every penny out of everyone- but I also think that’s not an excuse to be a thief and millions of people in poverty don’t steal. 

So we’ve established I don’t like thieves personally. I think they’re bad people, wouldn’t want them near me or at my bbq. 

*No human life is worth a material item.* I am totally fine with 2,000 more catalytic converter thefts even if one (1) person *doesn’t die*. 

So I had to really sit here and try to figure out why you’re ok with looking at a pile of metal and saying you’d rather exchange it for multiple human lives. 

And the only thing I can think of to reframe this is you are viewing this from a Christian paradigm. That a trespass of law is a sin, and sins are supposed to be punished with eternal torture and death. So you’re willing to kill anyone who trespasses because they’re sinners and thus worse than worthless. 

If I’m wrong tell me what you’re coming from. 

But this worldview is so baffling to someone outside the sinner paradigm. Because a HUMAN LIFE cannot be replaced like a hunk of inanimate metal. And even if you don’t LIKE a person that doesn’t mean they deserve death. And the theft of any item leading to death- That’s an exchange of the irreplaceable for the replicatable. 

I don’t think the lessening of crime (not even the total removal, just a downward shift!) is worth the danger and death.

At one point, highway 36 was closed due to the Lefthand canyon fire, highway 34 was closed due to the CPF, and highway 7 was closed due to the fire near Nederland. Then the East Troublesome fire kicked in over in Grand Lake, which is ultimately the fire that forced our evacuation. Then they closed Trail Ridge Road. All of the other highways eventually opened back up, but we were beginning to wonder how the hell to leave! The day we were evacuated, the sky was so orange and dark that we had to turn on our lights so we could see to pack—-at 2:30 in the afternoon! And some idiots say these fires are “overblown by the media”??? The only thing that really saved much of RMNP and Estes Park was the dense fog that moved in and laid the fire down, followed by a huge snowstorm. Timing was everything—-that East Troublesome fire was about one mile from the YMCA, and the winds were howling.

"The idea behind the gathering is solid-- peace, love, etc. The problem is that the gathering attracts a LOT of people who don't simply want the community in general, and don't simply believe in forming a community with little/no personal property (within the group)-- they tend to attract a LOT of people with no boundaries whatsoever.

A common theme is messing with food at a store in a way that requires the store to throw it out...and then they dumpster dive the food. Or outright theft and claim they are borrowing and that there is no such thing as even personal items (eg. theft from a backpacker, theft from a car, etc). Others are violent, abusive, etc not only to their peers, but to strangers.

There have been numerous fires awfully coincidental to the group (none major, fortunately) which they actively deny happen at all-- not just ""not me"", but ""no, no fire"".

They claim to work with forest service/etc and Native leadership, but at best it is ""you can't stop everyone, we'll be there on Thursday, and because we have no central authority we can't enforce any rule/request you may have-- that's on you and good luck, and by the way we aren't the type to listen much.""

A few may clean up after, most do not. At best that amounts to putting piles of trash bags together and filling in potty trenches. The public are left footing the bill for any ecological followup, trail repair, etc. that may occur. The amount of damage varies highly from location to location and by the number of people & length of time of the camp. One camp may be effectively no damage, others can run up repair to a half-million $ and years or more. Native sites of various types may or may not be respected, see previous few paragraphs for type of personality and attitudes that may show up.

Basically, they may have a good intention but they flat-out refuse to self-organize and blatantly reject any attempts for rangers and/or municipal and/or Native leadership to put down boundaries with the partial exception for fire regulations (eg. they may cook in an earth oven or with gas instead of an open fire pit). This results in a free-for-all by any ill-intended people, and the people who are ill-intended and/or don't understand that strangers they meet may have personal boundaries...and all those negative impacts leave a lot of resentment in the group's wake.

The flat-out refusal by the ""mindful"" to reject the bad actors make it impossible for the public to do anything but want to throw out the baby with the bathwater. We can't differentiate between who's who, and until the group decides to help with that there is not much to be done but reject the whole thing.

Note here that I am not hating on gathering, nor on any of the Earth-loving, incense burning, toking, etc. Burning Man does well on a routine basis. The National Mall (DC) and The Gorge (WA) both do groups this large and larger without issue on a near-daily basis. Major National Parks can do that or more on a busy weekend, every weekend. Red Rocks (CO) can do 10,000/night every day of the week and be open to hiking on top of that. There are how many damn festivals and raves. Even a freaking County Fair in bumufkc\* nowhere can do that number on a Friday and the only real problem is traffic. Many of these (or at least the concert venues) even manage this with everyone high, drunk, getting a bj behind a bush, or simply hopped up on adrenaline. \[edit: Coachella might be another really good example of how to do a big, long event with a \*hitton of drunk/high people, and do it well\].

The problem is not the activities, or the numbers\*. The problem is that this very specific group conflates ""public"" and ""rights"" with ""free for all"", and completely denies that there are any downstream consequences to people outside the gathering-- and THAT creates a lot of resentment (never mind figurative and literal costs) that can linger for years.

"The big 3 to do solo in Denver are music / sports / comedy. 

- For music, check out the Red Rocks schedule but also other venues like the Fillmore, Ogden, etc. We have one of the best music scenes in the nation!

- For sports, lucky again, we have some of the best teams as well! Avalanche games are sooooo much fun and I go solo a ton. The Nuggets are also great, but tbh I love going to Rockies games and just getting the “rockpile” tickets. $10 and it’s basically standing room at the top jack daniels terrace bar overlooking the mountains and the game. I barely watch the game and treat it like a fun bar cover charge. Broncos too even though it’s pricier - we just got a bigggg name QB that should bring a ton of fun. I also second Volo Sports. 

- Lastly comedy, we also have a massive and well respected comedy vibe here. I saw Nate bargatze a couple weeks ago. Check out the Comedy Works schedule and red rocks as well. I have tickets to John Mulaney this summer.

"These are only worth that much money to a competitor - they're prototype bikes and would stand out like a sore thumb on the roads. You wouldn't even be able to get them serviced without catching a felony, there isn't a bike shop within a thousand miles that would be able to do more than replace the tires on any of those bikes. The reason they got stolen is because that prototype shop is in a shitty warehouse row next to foothills in Boulder, there's little to no action for cops to worry about and a bike path nearby means the thieves could get away on the product in no time without even being on camera - you could bust down the door and be gone in minutes. Still, these are either going to sit in storage for decades, get taken apart by competitor labs, or be found on the side of the road somewhere because the people who stole them can't sell them or service them. Only competitors and true bike nerds would know about that shop, though...the smart move would be to get them out of the country ASAP.

Correction: the $12k Specialized could possibly get maintenance done by someone who knows their stuff, and it could possibly be used on mountains around CO without getting a ton of attention, depending on the trails it's ridden on and how deep in the mountains they are with the bike.
