"I hear you. As I see it the focus on real estate development and the monied interests of Pedro not only is unrelated to the needs of folks in Wilmington, harbor gateway and harbor city but it also ignores the needs of folks in Pedro. Even the demographics of Pedro and these folks’ needs don’t reflect the political projects of Buscaino. A candidate who actually understands and lives the lives and needs of the majority of the folks in an admittedly gerrymandered district I think is a positive way forward. This is also a way to get discussions going about the whacky district lines. Your concerns are totally valid and our current representation isn’t concerned about them or the diverse needs elsewhere in the district.

The projects look like shit but within 2 or 3 years they will all be converted into condominiums. I would assume residents will be relocated or given the opportunity to purchase their unit. I agree though I love living in San Pedro but I live all the way up off of the Western words a lot nicer than down there. I hate coming down to that area but I believe it'll be cleaned up within the next 2 years and San Pedro will be nicer than surrounding cities like Long Beach Torrance Harbor city and all I've ever seen it and all those other ones. And actually already is. People are just talking down about that 1 little corner but look at the rest of San Pedro and also look at the top part of Western down by sunken city and all those areas it's absolutely stunning.,t2_a5siy92w,colinm37,0,1644999512.0,0,t1_hx5e00p,hx5e00p,False,KittenImmaculate,t3_sezzex,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanPedro/comments/sezzex/anyone_live_in_or_have_any_insight_to_this_complex/,Anyone live in or have any insight to this complex?,/r/SanPedro/comments/sezzex/anyone_live_in_or_have_any_insight_to_this_complex/hx5e00p/,1,r/SanPedro,0,1
Most of the Og's from RSP are up state in prison.  There was about 4 of them that got arrested for murder about 6 years ago and they were high ranking. A bunch of others got locked up for distributing a controlled substance (meth)  If there's any remnants of that gang it's just a bunch of knuckleheads because the shot callers are gone. Federal authorities did a sweep of that place that place after a long narcotics investigation 2 or 3 years ago.  The projects are all being converted into condominiums also prior to the opening of the waterfront I believe.

"I don't live in that specific complex but I've lived in this part of San Pedro for a few years now. There are a lot of cool bars, shops, and restaurants within walking distance on 6th and 7th streets. I've never felt unsafe walking around in the immediate area, there is a high school and Port police station by there. People also love to dump their scooters on 5th if you want to use one to get around. I have also walked up and down Harbor (on the port side) with no issues, I see a lot of people using that path to exercise.

Unfortunately the only grocery store that I would walk to is Numero Uno, otherwise I drive to Vons/Ralphs/Albertsons/Trader Joes etc. I wouldn't walk north past 3rd street because then you get into the projects. There is a big homeless encampment by the post office if you choose to walk there too.

"Back in 2018, the county of Los Angeles issued an ordnance that limits the amount of roosters in unincorporated areas of the county. Under half an acre properties can have 2 roosters if they want more they have to apply for licensing. The goal of the ordinance was to curb cock fighting. 

Here is the link to the ordinance for more information.

That being said, residents still have to abide by their city’s zoning regulations. If your  city or specific neighborhood is not zoned for fowl you have some recourse. 

I could not find any specific agricultural codes for San Pedro so I recommend contacting your council member Joe Buscaino’s office (310) 732 -4515. The assistants will be able to locate regulations about housing fowl and you can ask them what your options are. 

This master list for Los Angeles county agriculture codes put together by UCLA does not list San Pedro as being zoned for fowl, but it could be a mistake or not up to date.

"**[SS Sansinena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SS_Sansinena)** 
 
 >SS Sansinena was a Liberian oil tanker that exploded in Los Angeles harbor on Friday, 17 December 1976 at 7:33pm. She was docked at berth 46 at Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro, California. The vessel was a steamship built in 1958. At its final port of call, Sansinena had discharged its cargo of crude oil and was taking on ballast and fuel when a massive explosion split the ship in half and obliterated multiple port buildings.

"I’ve lived here all my life (I’m 20f) and so far here’s my advice. Most of the time anything below gaffey is considered the worse areas. Anything above western is considered the best suburbs. Basically, the closer you are to the hill the better the neighborhoods. That said, it seems your neighborhood seems ok, though I’ve never been there much and don’t know a lot about it. It’s easy to tell when things are ghetto. Still, I would do my shopping on gaffey or above. The neighborhoods surrounding cabrillo beach are pretty good and I find generally okay. 

I have never had issues with the air here.. in fact I would say it’s probably cleaner then most of LA, since the sea winds blow inland and make it so that the smog is low. About once or twice a year the winds reverse and it’s obvious (you can see the smog on the sea) 

I personally don’t surf, so I can’t say for sure, but I think cabrillo is not that popular for surfing. It’s more a chill beach for kids to play. Common surf spots are in the small coves all along the coast through Palos Verdes. I’d do more research though as I can’t really say much. 

If you want to get involved in the community, I suggest going to the shows at the brewing company near the marina. I’m kinda biased because my dads in a band that plays at them XD but there’s also first thursdays on 6th street off pacific. Those are REALLY popular. Just ask around, or go to coffee shops, there’s usually mention of an event going on that people can point you to. We have a big music/rockNroll culture here. Lots of art and military too.

"The area near point fermin school is pretty safe. The general rule of thumb is south of 25th is good OR west of gaffey is good. If youre south and west that is safest. Pedro is a good value, definitely a bit of a hidden gem. Also there is a big waterfront port development coming which looks like it will be pretty nice with restaurants and entertainment. Hoping that sparks an improvement in the area even more.

Edit: also you're right by Whisky flats bbq. Great neighborhood spot. And korean bell park is close -pretty awesome park with killer views and amazing basketball court.

You are definitely in a good spot there. No worries Especially being in the gated community. I lived in the condos that are next to the property with those homes. I moved to 25thish and meyler which is closer to the coast. It’s cooler here but if you have ac that’s not an issue. But it is usually like a 10 degree difference. I did enjoy being closer to Torrance and the 110 when I was in the condo. Now I got to add an extra ten to fifteen minutes to every trip.

"Here's the text of the article in case you're hit by the LA Times paywall.

LA Times David Zahniser SEP. 3, 2021
Los Angeles City Councilman Joe Buscaino has begun laying the groundwork for a ballot measure that would prohibit people from sleeping or camping on sidewalks and other public spaces if they have turned down offers of shelter or emergency housing.


Buscaino, who is running for mayor, said he intends to ask his colleagues to place his proposal on the June 2022 ballot — one where he also plans to appear as a citywide candidate. He said that if the council declines to act, he would gather the nearly 65,000 voter signatures necessary to qualify the proposal for the ballot.


The proposal offers the latest sign that homelessness will be a central issue in next year’s municipal election, both in the mayor’s race and in other city contests.


Buscaino argued that his ballot proposal, still in the early stages, would help the city respond to a humanitarian crisis more swiftly than it will under the city’s new anti-camping ordinance, which was approved in July and goes into effect on Friday. The ballot measure would provide emergency housing for ""everyone living on the streets,"" while also prohibiting encampments in all public areas, he said.


""We’ve learned through experience that not everyone goes into shelter if there are no consequences for staying on the street,"" Buscaino said. ""There need to be rules banning camping citywide.""


The councilman, who represents neighborhoods from Watts to San Pedro, said he has already begun speaking with donors who are ""anxious and excited"" about the proposal. Contributions are going into his ballot measure committee, Joe Buscaino for a Better L.A.


Still, Buscaino is already facing pushback from some of his colleagues, who have spent the past two months developing their own strategy for delivering services to the unhoused and restoring access to public spaces. ""Until I am caused to think otherwise,"" said Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, ""what he is proposing is enforcement with lipstick on it.""


""Enforcement alone, no matter how you dress it up, is never going to be sufficient to address this crisis,"" said Ridley-Thomas, who heads the council’s homelessness committee. ""What’s needed, and desperately so, is housing and services. And so my comment to Mr. Buscaino would be: Show me the housing, Joe. Show me the housing.""


Councilman Kevin de León, who has been pondering his own run for mayor, also weighed in against Buscaino’s proposal. ""The council is already moving forward on a plan that balances effective outreach, housing, and enforcement,"" he said in a statement. ""This ballot measure is simply the wrong approach.""


Homelessness has emerged as a front-burner issue in L.A. The city’s unhoused population exceeded 41,000 during the last formal homelessness count, which was conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak.


One recent voter survey, conducted between July 29 and Aug. 5, found that 93% of respondents viewed homelessness as a very serious problem or extremely serious problem. Another poll, commissioned in June by Buscaino’s mayoral campaign committee, found that 50% of respondents strongly favored the idea of banning camping on sidewalks and inside parks if camping areas with restrooms were offered elsewhere. An additional 30% somewhat supported the idea, the survey found.


Buscaino said he is modeling his efforts, in part, on the city of Austin, Texas, where voters overwhelmingly approved a law in May making it a criminal offense to sit or lie down on a public sidewalk or sleep outdoors in its downtown and in the area around the University of Texas. He also cited efforts underway in Seattle, where civic leaders have attempted to put a package of strategies for addressing homelessness on the ballot, only to face legal setbacks.


In L.A., the new anti-camping ordinance will allow council members to prohibit homeless encampments on sidewalks near schools, parks, daycare centers and other public facilities. However, enforcement cannot take place unless the council has approved a resolution allowing such actions in a particular location.


Once a location has been identified by the council, city crews would need to install signs making clear that the area has been designated for enforcement. Enforcement would not begin for at least 14 days after those signs have gone up. U.S. appeals court says L.A. can’t seize and discard homeless people’s bulky property


Council members are still putting together the ordinance’s ""street engagement"" strategy, which would assign outreach workers to help unhoused people secure housing, shelter and other services in each targeted area. That strategy, envisioned as a seven-step process, is expected to come up for a council vote in two weeks.


Buscaino, who voted for the anti-camping law, nevertheless contends that the process will be too slow and bureaucratic to provide meaningful progress. Meanwhile, the city’s strategy has been denounced by homeless advocates, who say it will saddle people living on the streets with financial penalties that will make it more difficult for them to escape poverty.


Foes of the ordinance also contend that the measure will be confusing, leaving homeless people unclear about where they can sleep outdoors. Buscaino agreed, saying the city needs an ordinance that is easier to understand.


Ridley-Thomas, who recently ruled out a mayoral bid, said he believes Buscaino is only pursuing a ballot measure in hopes of delivering a boost to his own citywide campaign. Buscaino denied the allegation in an interview.

"As someone who grew up in San Pedro and has lived around the country and traveled internationally, I couldn’t think of a better place to live. 

You have White Point Beach where you can go to tide pools and surf, an affordable and truly middle class community which is rare in LA, weather and beauty only comparable to the Amalfi Coast, and Busy Bee sandwiches around the corner. 

It’s fairly diverse and pretty friendly especially to families and leans conservative politically if that is your thing. It has not been gentrified, it is not chopped up by freeways and the abundance of LA proper is not a long drive away. It’s basically a small town that gets to benefit from being part of one of the largest cities in the world but has fewer of the drawbacks and so much natural beauty. And shit is still cheap there. 

So move your family there and enjoy it while the above still holds true, take them to the grunion run, go whale watching, go to the Korean Bell and go to Catalina. I’d like to think your children will thank you so many years later for these experiences.",t2_an13j,gridsquarereference,0,1622961908.0,0,t1_h0rqz4q,h0rqz4q,True,TriassicTurtle,t3_ntcyl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanPedro/comments/ntcyl7/good_place_for_young_family/,Good place for young family?,/r/SanPedro/comments/ntcyl7/good_place_for_young_family/h0rqz4q/,8,r/SanPedro,0,8

"Moved to Pedro in 2017 and have lived here since. Me and wife originally lived just above 1st and Gaffey. And we have since moved to to 1st and Western. 

The first two places are going to be your best bet for safety. Everyone here telling to be above Gaffey is 100% correct. Parking is a bit cramped below Gaffey as well.

Outside of that Pre-Covid Pedro is amazing. 1st Thursday is great and the Farmers Market on Friday are great ways to experience local San Pedro. Restaurants on 5th, 6th and 7th are diverse and pretty reasonably priced.

"San Pedro is amazing! We’e moved because of a job opportunity but when living there we always called it the hidden gem of LA. It’s a fairly quiet town, no traffic, great microclimate, and lots of nature & hiking very close by. If you ever want the city life or nightlife, Long Beach is only about 10 min over the bridge, and downtown LA isn’t too bad of a drive depending on the time of day.

Edit to add: as much as I loved San Pedro, if we were to move back we’d go back to Long Beach. It was so artsy and full of different cultures. In my opinion, it’s more of a dog city and easier to meet people because it has more “going out type places” like Pine St and 2nd St. Pre-covid, there were always cool free events like movies on the beach and yoga at the bluff (a park overlooking the ocean). The parking was horrible, but San Pedro can be difficult in that aspect too depending on the neighborhood.",t2_5fjmmwz0,alekstoro,0,1613096535.0,0,t1_gn0idgu,gn0idgu,True,birdgebirdbrains,t3_lhu6kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanPedro/comments/lhu6kb/i_think_im_in_love_with_san_pedro/,I think I'm in love with San Pedro?,/r/SanPedro/comments/lhu6kb/i_think_im_in_love_with_san_pedro/gn0idgu/,1,r/SanPedro,0,1

"For a taste of something different, try Joseph's Bakery between 10th and 11th on Meyler. They have a nice sweet roll and good pizza. 

Then we have the relatively new Colossus Bakery who are doing great things with sour dough. I got their sour dough raisin bread and it was delicious. Their pastries (sweet rolls, etc) sell out quick, and they open up at 8, so you have to be quick. They only do online purchasing with in-person pick up:  https://colossus-bread.square.site/s/order

Then there is a pretty good mexican bakery on 3rd and pacific called Acacia Bakery. They have all of the conchas and bready and colorful mexican pastries available. That's worth a visit too. I like their boudin which is a sweet bread pudding-like bread desert.

"It's honestly not that bad. 

I've lived here all my life but my mom wasn't from here so I've always just felt like it was a place I lived and grew up in VS ""my town, my home"". 

There's definitely a lot of awful ""townie"" type people here if you dig deep but you really only see them if you lurk too many awful local community Facebook groups where the real keyboard warriors come out of the woodwork. 

Those are the try hard snooty ones who probably live above Gaffey and will want to give you the whole ""hurr ride or die for pedro don't fuck with our small town"" kind of mentality. Most people here are pretty chill. 

Your only real downside may be a commute. Yes it's the port but its also the butt end of the freeway. There's not a huge bar/nightlife scene here but if you work remote and want to be chill like you are saying I personally think it's a fine place. The upside is there's plenty of smackin food places here and around the south bay in general so that'll be fun

"That part of san pedro is very much like dtla, it's also where all the hotels are so it will feel alot like home.  It feels very safe and most of the buildings are nice and new.  It's when you get closer to Pacific and Gaffey that it starts to feel like south central, especially near the freeway.",t2_11rtew,FortuneMonger,0,1591581118.0,0,t1_ftbslt7,ftbslt7,True,shirlen3,t3_gyp6ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanPedro/comments/gyp6ee/moving_to_downtown_san_pedro_from_dtla/,Moving to Downtown San Pedro from DTLA,/r/SanPedro/comments/gyp6ee/moving_to_downtown_san_pedro_from_dtla/ftbslt7/,7,r/SanPedro,0,7

"Hey there, my wife and I bought our house 2 years ago (late 30s) and it's rough around the edges but we immediately felt part of the community. We speak to 5 of our neighbors regularly and we've liked almost everyone we've met. We're 3 blocks from the 3 downtown streets between Mesa and Centre. 

If you're single and or don't have kids yet I'd definitely say downtown is a good spot. It's still sleepy most of the time but it's coming up. We've gotten 5 or 6 new restaurants downtown just the last 18 months or so and the city is trying to pump it up. They've talked about shutting down some streets to traffic to let restaurants put tables in the streets regularly. They've already done it some. 

And in a couple years the waterfront will begin opening and I'm stoked we're gonna be easy walking distance from that. We walk our dog downtown all the time. 

The homeless problem has gotten better since a shelter opened up but that's always something to think about. There are more random fireworks down here. 

We like it a lot so far and are really looking forward to the city's future.",t2_167jhn,chasinjason13,0,1591580475.0,0,t1_ftbrjn9,ftbrjn9,True,shirlen3,t3_gyp6ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/SanPedro/comments/gyp6ee/moving_to_downtown_san_pedro_from_dtla/,Moving to Downtown San Pedro from DTLA,/r/SanPedro/comments/gyp6ee/moving_to_downtown_san_pedro_from_dtla/ftbrjn9/,6,r/SanPedro,0,6

"My step bro and a group of ppl went down to 6th and 7th st today and boarded up the businesses to help protect from rioting and looting.

So far there hasn't been any activity since sun night when they hit 1st and Gaffey. But when I was at the pharmacy earlier a lady said that she heard the big 5 was hit. Though I didn't see anything when I drove by.

I also saw that longshoremen are volunteering to protect our local businesses.
