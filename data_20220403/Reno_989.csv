"NTA.

My philosophy is: I don't have the authority to decide if someone deserves help. That authority belongs to politicians or law enforcement or the restaurant owner or your God or fate or whatever you believe in.

I *do* personally feel I have an obligation to help those who need it, and I will do so. If your government or God or whoever doesn't like that then they should do something about it.

I particularly don't buy the ""feeding the bears makes more bears"" argument: we are talking about people, not wild animals. If giving people help attracts more people that need help I say you're welcome for giving {government, God, whoever} the opportunity to help more people in one place.

To proactively address those who argue I don't have the authority to ""encourage"" someone to visit a private business by helping them: yup you're absolutely right.

"So, I was at a local coffee place yesterday where a homeless, and possibly mentally ill, person was attempting to order coffee. The manager at the time pulled him aside from the small line and told him he is no longer welcome there. He didn’t become agitated but he didn’t really take no for an answer. It became awkward quickly and after about 10 mins of back and fourth he left. I overheard parts of the conversation and in short he was causing problems at several other places. I have a lot of sympathy for the homeless but to be blunt I don’t want to hang around an establishment that allows unpredictable people (homeless or not) to hang out there. It’s tough all around.

"That is an interesting experience and thank you for sharing it. Mine has been a bit different. I understand that the pay ratio may seem important but the decrease in purchasing power is more troublesome. In my previous comment in regards to OP's rent issue, I wanted to point out that it's not a Reno issue but a national issue. I don't have a good solution, but it's important to identify the correct cause. CEO pay isn't the reason a house is 1/3 million in Reno and curbing CEO pay won't get anyone much closer income wise.

"I think cars go to the root of America. The story of westward expansion was epitomized by the horse and wagon. Leaving to America and specifically the West symbolized freedom, something I believe we still get about cars. There's something very primitive and attractive about just getting up and being able to leave whenever you want, wherever you want, not bound by the common train seat or the determination of the rails. Justly so too, don't you think, our country is super beautiful and sometimes you need a wrangler to get there. The real shame, I think, and I speak as a huge car fan, is that public transportation wasn't invested in as heavily along side of the highway infrastructure, because we ""blew our whole load"" (in carbon terms) on boring commuter cars and now we can't have any gasoline vehicles, fun or not.

"The Tahoe Rim Trail is a strenuous hike, even for people who are in good shape and hike regularly. Just the single stretch from Brockway Summit to Mt. Rose Summit has more than 4,500 feet of elevation gain, IIRC. That’s no small feat for someone who doesn’t hike regularly, even without considering balance issues, recovering from previous surgeries, elevation intolerance, etc. This could pretty quickly become a situation that is at best not super fun, and at worst, unhealthy for your father. 

I’d have to agree with another commenter that point-to-point might be a better choice. Maybe start with a few legs that have less elevation gain, either as day hikes or small overnights, and then assess before tackling the more technical sections. [Here](https://tahoerimtrail.org/day-hiking/) is a great resource for that. 

Or if you’re set on doing it as a thru hike, which frankly I wouldn’t recommend, maybe readjust your pace is expectations. 17 days equates to ten miles a day roughly, which is a lot to expect of anyone who doesn’t hike often, not to mention someone who may benefit from moving at a slower pace for balance/injury reasons.",t2_3h32r11u,azurinia,0,1648920922.0,0,t1_i34pocg,i34pocg,True,Crozadile,t3_tu0vl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/tu0vl8/tahoe_rim_trail_fitness_benchmark_suggestions/,Tahoe Rim Trail Fitness Benchmark Suggestions?,/r/Reno/comments/tu0vl8/tahoe_rim_trail_fitness_benchmark_suggestions/i34pocg/,2,r/Reno,0,2

"The gay bars in Reno are OK, but might be disappointed if you are from a bigger city. Don't belive the reviews, they are definitely worth checking out! 

Carl's Saloon (my favorite) - going to be the most relaxed and casual. Feels like a neighborhood dive bar. Often an older crowd. Nearly empty on the weekdays. Do karaoke frequently. Also do a leather/gear night first Sat of the month which is an amazing time. Also note, this bar will be very heavily male most nights. 

Faces - going to feel like a bar for the ""pretty"" or ""popular"" folk. Often have drag events and can get pretty packed. Feels like a club more than a bar. 

Splash - probably the youngest crowd. Lots of drag shows, and often get some pretty well known performers. Good for a fun night out to party. 

5 star - very mixed crowd, gay and straight. The place most people end up at the end of the night. People get white girl wasted here and stay out until nearly sunrise. 

The Emerson - the most expensive and most ""high class"" cocktail bar. If ya like something a bit fancier, this is your best bet. 

Our Center - not a bar. LGBT hangout with frequent events. Check out the website if you want something that isn't a bar. 

Aside from the above, lots of coffee shops and other places in town are very LGBTQ friendly, thought maybe not specifically geared ""for the LGBTQ community""",t2_4duwj2vo,Petergriphy,0,1648871834.0,0,t1_i32jyl9,i32jyl9,True,YaoiLover34,t3_tu99j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/tu99j3/any_good_lgbtq_hangs/,Any good LGBTQ hangs?,/r/Reno/comments/tu99j3/any_good_lgbtq_hangs/i32jyl9/,12,r/Reno,0,12

">   If you’re making a rule that teachers must break up a fight 

I'm not, I specifically wrote I'm against that. 

I literally wrote for the protection of kids,  Teachers who can break up a fight, should, and they should have legal immunity for the action of breaking up a fight. 

That's still equal treatment and equal protection under the law.   Its just not ""equal outcomes"". 

Just like many  good Samaritan laws, Including [Neavada's](https://naqvilaw.com/your-guide-to-nevadas-good-samaritan-law/). 

If you saw someone drowning in a river and pulled them out.  But while you pulled them out, they lost their cellphone.  You can't be held legally liable to replace their cellphone. 

This doesn't force you to jump into the river to save them.  And just because you saved someone last week, you don't have to jump in again, this week. 

I agree teachers are there to teach.  but no teaching is getting done in the middle of a fight.  

I don't think you understand the point I'm making.  \*shrugs\*  No worries.

"Teachers shouldn’t get involved, and shouldn’t be expected to get involved. In the classroom, or at a park off school after hours. 

Teachers are there to teach. These boys will figure out what they did or said to get beat up and take the corrective actions necessary. 

If a teacher gets involved with a fight in any way they shouldn’t be protected because they’re the adult and they know consequences occur when you get involved with a fight.  


I disagree with the logic that some teachers can get involved some times based on their age, gender, athletic ability, or anything else.   If you’re making a rule that teachers must break up a fight then literally every single teacher is required to break up a fight.  No exceptions.

"I don’t want to crush your dreams. My experience in that market is quite dated. With that said…

Not sure what the job market is like now as I am retired, but back in the day that was about enough experience to get you a dub monkey job at some post house mindlessly making copies all day.

Maybe in a bigger market at a larger post house where they pay assistant editor to digitizing and logging and stuff like that it would be cool, but Reno will never be that market.

Best options as I see them to work in that field in Reno….

Local tv stations. 
They always need help on the newroom crews, especially for morning news. Those camera ops get up EARLY.

IATSE local 363
They get to do all the big fun jobs in the area. There a movie shoot? IATSE. Concert? IATSE? Rodeos, the ranch rodeo, you name it, those are IATSE crews.

Local sports.
Show up at the production truck at lawler before a game, resume and work gloves in hand.
Beg.
Show up every week and repeat until you become such a pain in their ass that they hire you because it’s cheaper than the time you waste otherwise.

Once you have some practical experience on your belt try to get on with Golf Channel when they do the Barracuda. That is the best way into a high end gig (Universal/NBCSports) from the Reno market.

I just wouldn’t expect to have much luck with limited experience with consumer software.
Yes, some professional edit bays may have those it them, but that will be the cost cutting minority that honestly, from my experience, you d9 t want to work for anyway.
Never have I ever worked at a post house or station that used Premiere and have them be worth the effort and air expended saying their name.

 Now After Effects can be a different story, but you want to market yourself an an AE artist and compositor rather than as an editor that knows AE.

1st and foremost, demo reel. Put together a good one, but do not blow off your former clients non disclosures and trade secrets when doing so. Easy trap to fall into. Saw it destroy a post house once. Not mine, thank god.

Anyway, good luck. 

I have heard that some aspects of the production market are hurting for people right now so it is fully possible to find your unicorn.

That is really kind of you to want to do that and good for you for even just considering it tbh,.. but I would be careful if you went that route though. If you feel hesitation on it then I would probably not do it or atleast go do a 30 minute consult with a lawyer. I do know landlord/tenant laws are different when the landlord lives in the home. But you will become a landlord and that can come with big headaches. Try to protect yourself. Don't feel like you have to do something like that unless you are fully comfortable with it.  Be safe. 


My experience with roommates has always been okay but I've always known at least one roommate beforehand. My favorite roommates are ones where we can hang out every once jn awhile but mostly we all keep to ourselves and do our thing. But there are still crummy people out there along with all the good. Roommates and sharing with someone can be a good experience too.

">A gun is an extremely effective tool for self-defense, so claiming it wouldn't have helped when you have no evidence of statistically unlikely events that would make it less effective is a really obvious and strong bias.

Yeah a gun is a great tool for self defense when someone doesn't walk up to your car window from behind pointing a gun at you, because the person holding you at gunpoint can kill you before you can reach for anything, gun or not, you're telling me to spend more time thinking about this when you couldn't imagine something simple like that happening?

If a teacher can reasonable break up a fight,  and they are okay with that risk, they should try to.   They should not fear a law suit from trying. 

A 64 year old, could probably break up 2 kindergarteners from hurting each other. 

A 45 year old man, who is willing to risk some injury, could jump between two 17 year old's.  

As much as i want every single fight broken up, ASAP.  I don't want a law that forces the old lady, to jump into two 17 year old foot ball players fighting. 

I also don't want a teach to be sued, for making a good faith effort at stopping a fight.

"It's also a ridiculously misleading statistic because they're basing it off labor force, defined as people who are employed or are looking, excluding a huge chunk.

Do you actually think there are only 250k working age,  capable adults in washoe?

'Cause there's a hell of a lot more than that. [Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/washoecountynevada) estimates put the working age population at around 310k. Knock off 5% of that to cover disabled or otherwise unable to work, which is a high average estimate for labor force (most I've seen use 3.8%) and we have just over 298k labor force with 243k employed. 

So, you know, 55k unemployed.  Higher probably since I'm using 2021 population numbers. 

So try 18.5% true unemployment. Sure we can tweak the labor force down with whatever methods you want, like suggesting that the incapable of work population is 8 or even 10% off the 310k, but excluding 50k+ of your working age population from the labor force is a pretty herculean effort of statistical manipulation - you'd be claiming that 1 in 5 18-64 year old residents are INCAPABLE of working.

"> Why do people here get so upset at the suggestion we make our neighborhoods more walkable, rideable and community based.

Because it's a fancy money laundering scheme pushed by gullible,  useful idiots that don't recognize the reality that the millions they allocate to such projects result in 95%+ of it being embezzled and only crappy token improvements are completed that cater to maybe 5% of the population. 

> Why is driving 10-20 minutes one way to a grocery store better than a 5 minute walk or 3 minute bike ride?

Because most people can't lug their week or months groceries on a bike. Most won't want to walk each way in the snow or scorching summer heat. You're offering a solution in search of a problem that sounds good on paper but rejects reality. 

> Why are we letting ourselves be pushed to the edges of cities for longer commutes instead? 

Economic reality. Don't like it, move to kansas.

Don't know if you've noticed,  but what you're advocating is an extreme luxury that offers very little actual tangible benefits to the community because few would consume it.

"I don't know if something like robbing a store with a gun deserves a potential life sentence, up until this point I think that's about as violent as this guy got charged with.

The thing that got him 15 years ( of which he served 12 ) was helping dispose of a body of a drug dealer his girlfriend murdered. He was only 17 years old when he did that. While it's a very serious crimes I don't think it really is ""violent"".

The fact that he was released early after serving 12 of the 15 years at least implies that he was deemed to be safe to release. Maybe he was ""rehabilitated"" at one point but over time regressed. I think he was released in 2009/2010, and nobody is reporting him being in trouble with the law from that point until now. I think 12 years is more than enough time for a rehabilitated ex-con to regress back to serious crime.",t2_60f2e,chriskmee,0,1648756335.0,0,t1_i2w23hc,i2w23hc,False,Motor-Ad-8858,t3_tsq2ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/Reno/comments/tsq2ic/nevada_the_body_of_missing_18yearold_nevada_woman/,"Nevada: The body of missing 18-year-old Nevada woman Naomi Irion found, suspect charged",/r/Reno/comments/tsq2ic/nevada_the_body_of_missing_18yearold_nevada_woman/i2w23hc/,2,r/Reno,0,2
