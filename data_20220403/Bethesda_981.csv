"There's downtown Bethesda with the large buildings which is roughly Bradley Blvd to Cedar Lane, there's Bethesda which is roughly Cedar Lane to Tuckerman, and then there's North Bethesda which is roughly Tuckerman to Nicolson. North of that it's all strictly Rockville.

You can actually get condos in Bethesda for relatively cheap but they will be in very old buildings and the condo fees are hit/miss in how expensive it'll be. Single families are very expensive and just a teardown, if I recall, will start around $600K+.

"Overall, I think living at 8200 would tick the boxes for what you're looking for. You can walk a block or two and eat at good restaurants, or go shopping for groceries at the Harris Teeter that's practically next door. A Trader Joe's should be opening up in the near future that will also be within walking distance. The standard studios don't have a balcony or dishwasher I believe, but I'm living in a jr. one bedroom that has both and I'm paying less than $1,500 a month. The front desk staff when you enter are super friendly and helpful, but I did have an issue with the leasing center staff regarding my unit's dishwasher that was broken when I moved in. I could go into more detail, but basically, they started ducking me completely when I would ask for updates and I had to order a new part for it myself and fix it on my own. That was my only major negative interaction with them. Also, some of the units overlook the Mexican restaurant Guapo's, so be prepared to hear them sing happy birthday and play music on a near-daily basis on their patio once Spring rolls around. And don't even get me started on the construction with saw blades they would do past midnight on weeknights.

"Guesses based on google maps

8100 Wisconsin Ave:  Either Maple Beer & Wine or Bethesda Beer & Wine.

4800 Fairmont:  7-11 (Georgetown Carpet and EMYA Salon seem less likely)

7900 Norfolk: Capital Beer and Wine

The timing suggests they're local, maybe someone who worked at those places.  Bethesda is dead quiet after midnight, a single car driving around from 1-4 am would be noteworthy and there are occasional police patrols.  Around 4:30 AM traffic picks up, people going to work early in DC or at hospitals.  Considering they also had to actually gain entry and steal stuff I favor the ex-employee theory, although commercial storefront doors are ludicrously nonsecure these days.

"Here's the relevant law:

> Sec. 29-54. Rent adjustments; notice requirements.
   (a)    A landlord must not increase the rent until 90 days after the landlord gives the tenant written notice of the increase.  A landlord must not impose more than one rent increase on a tenant in any 12-month period.  

https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/montgomerycounty/latest/montgomeryco_md/0-0-0-15054

Thus, your rent cannot be increased again for another 12 months (by the way, the 1.4% increase is the maximum currently allowed; they legally cannot increase your rent by any more than that until mid-May due to covid-19 related legislation). That being said, since you're going month-to-month, don't assume you can stay in your unit for the entire 12 months as your landlord can revoke your lease with 60 days notice. So while you have flexibility, so does your landlord.

If you're still in your unit 12 months from now, your landlord can then increase the rent further, and that increase will definitely be higher than 1.4%. Probably substantially higher.

However, check with Montgomery County's Office on Landlord-Tenant Affairs just to make sure. Also refer to your lease.",t2_h9hqy,sumpdiddlyump_,0,1642131268.0,0,t1_hskyksa,hskyksa,True,Peckerwood17,t3_s3d9rt,https://www.reddit.com/r/bethesda/comments/s3d9rt/question_about_going_on_a_monthtomonth_lease/,Question about going on a month-to-month lease,/r/bethesda/comments/s3d9rt/question_about_going_on_a_monthtomonth_lease/hskyksa/,4,r/bethesda,0,4
"Hey I'm not a lawyer, just someone who has rented month to month and googled this: https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/maryland-late-fees-termination-nonpayment-rent-other-rent-rules.html

My understanding is the land lord enjoys the same benefits of the flexibility as you do, to an extent. In Montgomery county the notice to vacate and/or increase rent is only two months when in a month-to-month agreement. They can only raise rent at the end of the lease, or with 2 months notice when month to month. 

So, it's a risk decision for you. You could lock in your rent for 12/24 months, but have an obligation for the whole lease, or chance that your landlord doesn't raise your rent. Really depends on your situation. I used to have a land lord who kept my rent the same when month to month for a few years.

"I lived in downtown Bethesda for 8 years (the seasons on Bethesda ave) then I moved over to a condo in Van Ness and now I live in Friendship Heights.

Everything shuts down by 10:00 you could hear a pin drop its so quiet.  There used to be a bit more of one but most of the local bars and pubs that held that are gone and have been replaced with expensive shops.

"Elrich is a glorified schoolteacher who, like most of his ilk, is both weak and a closet fascist.  He just doesn't understand why we don't march silently in single file lines with our heads down, raising our hands and speaking only when called on.  


His periodic emails are darkly funny, a reminder that a job and a talking head that many of us didn't even know existed pre-pandemic is now on a full-on power trip seeking to exert ever tighter and more farcical control over our daily lives.

He has zero qualifications to speak about 'science' and yet it's a constant refrain.  His office provides analytics that would embarrass a two year old as this vicious swine stumbles and bumbles in a pandering panic.

Your comment about the space having very little in the way of natural light has me wondering if the windows are large enough to meet fire code specs.

Maybe look at Aldon of Chevy Chase and Aldon Glens on Battery Lane. Not sure what the studios/1bedrooms are going for these days but they’re on the *relatively* cheaper side in Bethesda. $1500 would be the minimum though. Furnished is also a pretty good deal as well.

"Honestly that’s a really good price for this area, I live in FH waliking distance to the metro, is it a one bedroom?   Are you being a dope? No you just are having a hard time adjusting to the DC area.   But that’s really cheap and you are getting a deal because it’s a private person.   Where will your kid be working at?   I moved to DC from a small town outside of Pittsburgh 20 years ago.  Yes it was some serious sticker shock.    One bedroom in Bethesda 2k or so standard no utilities but that would be walking to metro.   My advice?   Have him find a roommate and share expenses. Most kids right out of college have roommates, he could get a room in a house and save on expenses, it’s the only way they can afford to live.    Just for reference we bought a townhome in Friendship heights in 2019, and paid 820 for it, no contingencies in the contract as it, and had a bidding war.

Definitely Great Falls for hiking, the Billy goat trails are amazing (lots of rock hoping and scaling) and the Maryland side is also super bike friendly. Sugarloaf mountain is also awesome, great views especially in fall AND there’s another winery at the bottom of it, Sugarloaf Mountain Vineyard.

Laundry room is great. Occasionally somebody will do all of their laundry for the month at once and eat up all 6-7 machines, but generally you should be able to find a machine or two. Dryers are heavy duty and can take big loads.  Doing loads on off hours (hours not at 6pm) is the smart choice.

No (or very, very little) pests. They keep it really clean here and do occasional pest control.  It's really quite impressive considering the city environment surrounding the building.

There's a gym on site but its small and mostly uninhabited.  Weight machines, dumb bells, treadmills, exercise bike.

There's a community room that nobody uses that is open to everybody.

As an investment, and if the condo fees don't hurt your budget too much, it's a pretty sound one considering the hyper inflation of Bethesda real estate.  The condos aren't crazily expensive, especially considering the other offerings in the area.",t2_fxirb,signalbot,0,1633491370.0,0,t1_hfkb09y,hfkb09y,False,abcbri,t3_q294mt,https://www.reddit.com/r/bethesda/comments/q294mt/experience_living_in_sussex_house/,Experience living in Sussex House?,/r/bethesda/comments/q294mt/experience_living_in_sussex_house/hfkb09y/,1,r/bethesda,0,1

The building is an old wood frame structure, so you can hear your upstairs neighbors walking around if you have any. If you're sound sensitive you will have a difficult time with it.

I remember using barwood in the 90s and 2000s to get to the airport. Jeez it was bad. And once I took it from union station to Potomac. We agreed upon $40. I fell asleep and when I woke up we were in bad traffic. He started saying how he hated going to my area and it was going to cost more. I just said ok. Then wouldn’t open the trunk when we got there. My dad had to come out it was a mess. Middle of the night too. ONLY gave him $40.

"Taxi drivers actually bid on fares. The bid that generates the most profit for the taxi service wins the fare.

 Often the winning driver / bidder decides they don't actually want to take the fare after all, because there's not enough profit left for the driver, so you get a lot of driver no-shows. There's no real punishment to the driver for canceling the fare after they've won the bid. At least with Uber there's some accountability and an audit trail such that if the driver no-shows enough times, they're no longer permitted to drive for Uber.

That razor thin profit margin for taxi drivers often means they're not able to spend money on things like keeping the taxi well maintained or clean. That's doubly true if they are already paying the service for the use of the cab. Uber drivers own their own cars, so the incentive to keep the car clean and working is entirely different.",t2_54m2p,irishflu,0,1633016120.0,0,t1_hev0tba,hev0tba,False,mb7877mb,t3_pylms2,https://www.reddit.com/r/bethesda/comments/pylms2/best_taxi_services_in_the_area/,Best taxi services in the area?,/r/bethesda/comments/pylms2/best_taxi_services_in_the_area/hev0tba/,9,r/bethesda,0,9

"Hope you hear back and get the job!! I personally have loved living here over the past couple months. Coming from the Chicago area you might be more akin to this, but what surprised me most was how good public transport is. I ended up leaving my car in Indiana and have had no trouble getting around the city, DC, and a few other surrounding areas. I'm not sure where you'll be moving to in Bethesda but if it's anywhere near Bethesda Ave and Wisconsin Ave, I can definitely say that it is an amazing place so far. Everyone warned me that people in the East might be a lot less friendly than people in the Midwest but it seems that the people of Bethesda are a massive exception haha. Bethesda overall gives me a Big city yet small town vibe somehow which I find as an excellent in-between. Overall, I have had nothing but good times here and being able to travel to DC or anywhere else in the area via the metro has been a wonder.

"Who uses checks today and for large amounts?

I'm not living in USA, so maybe mileage varies (for whatever reason), but I've never used a check. There's today no payment I do that's not fully digital, and on top of that most of them are automatic, so the only thing I need to do is to see to that I have enough money on my account.

Companies push people to use this automatic process as it saves a lot of money for them and also for the banks. Banks really don't want people to visit them.

All purchases in shops are made with a card, and receipts are sent digitally and securely.

All letters of importance (agreements, licenses etc) are sent digitally and securely.

Why is USA (parts of hopefully) so backwards on this?
