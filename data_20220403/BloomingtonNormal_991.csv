"The academic breaks are always a relief, but many of us wouldn't have jobs without the university and its students. Most of the irritations and inconveniences we associate with the student body are either unavoidable issues associated with population density or issues caused by the university administration or other structures beyond the students' control.

I don't know how true it is that more students have cars on or near campus than in previous years, but that would make sense considering how much on-campus housing capacity ISU has shut down in recent years and not replaced. Before Rivian's impact, ISU's decision to demolish so many dorms had already impacted the local housing market and caused more students to become commuters rather than living directly on campus. The associated reduction in dining services also caused more students to rely on local grocers and restaurants rather than on-campus options.

I have the luxury of being able to live a comfortable distance from campus, so I only have to deal with student-related issues while I'm on campus for work.

Thankfully it was my work van, so no money out of my pocket.

On the north end of Veterans(Sam's club area) I hit one of the metal frames that hold the lane dividing reflectors. Thought it was a brake caliper at first. Put two gashes on both the inner and outer sidewall of the tire.

"Oh, this is super late, but I live in B-N and struggled with postpartum anxiety (basically the same thing as PPD, only it manifests as anxiety instead of depression, although it definitely contained hints of depression as well) a few years ago. I went to Terri Prenzler (LCSW)  and combined therapy with meds (sertraline) from my OBGYN's office. I think more than anything, just talking to someone was a huge relief. I don't know that Terri was the be-all, end-all of PPD (her practice was much more widespread), but she was an impartial listerner, gave good advice and encouragement. 

It took a while (9 months to a year?), but I pulled out of it and have gone on to have more kids without having PPD at all (took meds preemptively after giving birth).  Please note that I am generally not a fan of medication, but in this instance, I think it helped a LOT. If you truly have PPD, your brain is not functioning normally. For me, meds helped me to return to normal (never made me feel weird or anything). I was afraid they would make me feel out of it, but they didn't at all. They made me feel like ME again, until my body caught up and then I was able to ween off of them.

I also joined a moms' group and met a lot of other new moms, which helped tremendously, too. They were some of my first friends in town. 

So sorry to hear you are dealing with this. It's really hard. I hope you're doing okay (it's a month after your post, so maybe you're doing much better?). Please feel free to DM me if you want more info or just want to chat. I'd be more than happy to, really!

"Yeah.  I mean, perception is relative and all.  I was born and raised here, but lived in St Louis city for a few years, so more often than not(this isn't everybody or every time), ""bad part of time"" just means there's more black people there than other parts of town.

"I used to commute via train from Joliet, IL to Chicago. Even in that shorer time, it can be a haul. Pedestrians getting hit by trains, trains running behind, gate and computer issues. It could be a complete nightmare and sometimes take me way too long to get to work. That said, it beat driving and sitting in traffic. Especially if it's only 1-2 days a week. 

For rentals, private landlords are hard to find. We have lots of rental companies - but some are straight up slumlords. WGLT did a great landlord v tenant series so you'll know who to avoid. Be extra careful with listings because lots of housing here is student housing. We've lived in Oakbrook Court (owned by BayOak) and Arbors at Eastland, neither were bad. Oakbrook was our favorite place. 

Townies will tell you there are bad places to live and loads of crime. Don't buy in to it. Check crime maps and check out neighborhoods at different times of day and you'll be fine. Much of the crime is targeted and/or domestic and doesn't affect a majority of the population. You'll learn quickly people like to fearmonger and try to stifle growth.

Many people commute to Chicago. The train ride is really easy and fast. We moved to the area in August '21 and previously had jobs in B-N that were remote due to covid...so we've known about the move for two years and have been looking for a country house/farmette. There's little inventory and a lot of buyers. It was even hard finding a decent rental.

"The bus system in BloNo has significantly improved over the last decade, but I haven't taken it in years. They used to not run on Sundays and only had about 10 routes. Now it has significantly increased and they have at least what feels like twice as many routes.

"I‚Äôm living in Normal right now without a car* (fianc√© has a car which I use every now and then) and the transit system is definitely decent, I use it pretty much every day. I can‚Äôt compare it to Champaign, as I‚Äôve never lived there, but having visited plenty, it definitely seems like Bloomington-Normal is a much friendlier environment for non-drivers, and compared to our roads, C-U‚Äôs are dogshit.

The Constitution trail here is a big help, because you can get from where I am, the northernmost edge of Normal, to downtown Bloomington in less than 30 minutes on a bike via the trail, hitting Uptown halfway. There isn‚Äôt much you can‚Äôt do for leisure that isn‚Äôt accessible in some capacity via the trail, and the bus can take you pretty much anywhere else, besides the very fringe part of town, where there isn‚Äôt much anyways. There are even lines that stop right in front of the Target and Walmart here in town, so it makes shopping a lot easier; you‚Äôre not lugging groceries to the edge of Veterans‚Äô to wait for a bus like you would on War Memorial in Peoria. Where I‚Äôm at, there‚Äôs a Schnuck‚Äôs within line-of-sight walking distance, so I don‚Äôt even need the bus for that.

My main complaint about the busses here is the schedule. I wish the intervals were smaller, but it is what it is. It could definitely be a lot worse. The busses are always clean, and if they aren‚Äôt right on time it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre ahead of schedule.",t2_9lf45,TheBlackBradPitt,0,1646760234.0,0,t1_hzuzvaj,hzuzvaj,True,[deleted],t3_t9g7su,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/t9g7su/how_is_life_in_normal_without_a_car/,How is life in Normal without a car?,/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/t9g7su/how_is_life_in_normal_without_a_car/hzuzvaj/,1,r/BloomingtonNormal,0,1
">it's total nonsense to pretend it's going to be no big deal.

Also, in general, everyone you know is going to assume you have one. Social plans will be made accordingly and you're going to very likely have to constantly figure out how to get to places busses don't go.

"I think in some ways Champaign can be easier to get around on a bike (more E/W and N/S bike lanes), and it certainly has a better mass transit system, but outside of commuting to campus, downtown Champaign, or downtown Urbana, the roads are miserable and the drivers here are some of the worst I've experienced in IL, and I regularly see people driving inches away from cyclists well above the posted speed limit.

I think if you lived on the west side of Veterans in Bloomington/Normal biking everywhere would be easier hands down. Getting across Veterans on a bike is near impossible outside of the GE/Vernon trail segment. But Constitution Trail and its little fingers make for biking around town incredibly easy and SAFE. There's not going to be a lot of rentals in that price range East of Veterans anyways.

I grew up in the C/U area and live here currently, but I went to college and spent nearly 15 years living in B/N and if you're just considering a bike to get around for the majority of your commuting B/N wins hands down. If you're more interested in utilizing mass transit then probably Champaign. Either way you can't go wrong, they are both great central IL communities with a LOT to offer.

We had our wedding at Miller Park Pavilion. We had our ceremony upstairs and then transitioned downstairs for the reception immediately after. We had around 80 guests and it was the perfect size. This was 6ish years ago and the only issue we ran into was alcohol. We were only allowed to serve beer and wine and it had to be provided by our caterer. We would have preferred to just buy our own alcohol and hire a bartender but it worked out fine.

Fat Jacks in downtown Bloomington is a bit like two-face, so apt that Jack Nicholson is plastered on the wall. They've got probably the best wide-range beer selection in town.

"Hi there,

I consider myself to be somewhat of a craft beer fanatic, I just wanted to mention my favorite breweries in town and also mention a great bar just outside of town in Lexington.

First, the breweries.

Lil Beaver Brewing -- [http://www.lilbeaverbrewery.com](http://www.lilbeaverbrewery.com) \-- I could write love letters to Lil Beaver for you, but I shall refrain. What I will say instead, is that Lil Beaver is my wife and I's favorite place to eat and have a drink or two.

The food is made by a locally renowned talented executive chef. I must recommend the Beaver burger and cheese curds. They also have salads and pizzas.

They are well known for their stouts and IPA varieties, as well as their sweet fruit beers. The crowd is mostly families and friends  with a wonderful patio space, built by the owner himself, in the summer,

Inside, they have a really great space with plenty of seating for both big and small parties. They have a number of in-house-brewed beers on tap.

White Oak Brewing -- [http://www.whiteoak.beer](http://www.whiteoak.beer) \-- What I love about this place in Normal, IL, is their stouts and hazy IPAs. It's a small-batch brewery, but I would put their hazy IPAs up with anyone's they taste clean! not skunky!  They also look amazing in a glass!

They have a small indoor space, but there are always locals and people from around the area there sharing a drink. It feels very homey. The bartenders are super friendly! One thing to note, I don't believe they serve food.

Kemp's Upper Tap, Lexington, IL -- [https://www.facebook.com/kemps.tap](https://www.facebook.com/kemps.tap) \-- If you're ever looking to get out of town, but not go too far, may I recommend Kemp's Upper Tap to you? I'm a townie, so I'll always love Kemp's with a little bit of a bias, but this place has it all. For a local bar its size, they have a great menu, prepared by a great chef and crew. They also have a lot of taps, mostly craft beer, handpicked by the owner and sometimes bartender John Kemp and his wife Megan.

I love the burgers at Kemp's, but I can't say I've ever had a bad meal there. It's more of your standard bar food, but they also have these alcoholic slushies that are too die for! Very fruity, very cold, very good.

There are all kinds of people at Kemp's , both young and old. It's a nice little drive from Bloomington to Lexington. If you're ever looking for something a little more local, come check us out! Maybe do a little shopping, too?",t2_4axnu,lsmucker,0,1646416728.0,0,t1_hzcdx5o,hzcdx5o,True,BerneseMtClimber,t3_t6jidf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/t6jidf/best_bars_and_pubs_in_town_description_of_the/,"Best bars and pubs in town?

"My wife and I are kinda specialists in this. . . so you came to the right place.  The best places you want to check out for a food/drink kind of experience are:

Here are some of the best nice places for a date:

Rosies (Downtown) - Excellent food, casual, cozy vibe.  Excellent service.

Reality Bites (Downtown) - Excellent food.  The weekly specials are ALWAYS delicious.  Excellent drinks.  Excellent service.  More of a bigger city nice bar vibe.

Destihl - A great place for beer lovers.  Good food and Sunday Brunch.  Good service.  Nice upscale vibe.  Their brewery location has a lot of sandwiches but also lots of beer, obviously.

Medici in uptown normal, you might hear recommended.  But the fact is their food is good,  the atmosphere is decent, their drinks are decent, but their service is terrible.  Recommend avoiding it.

Stave in uptown normal is a FANTASTIC wine bar.  Their charcuterie boards cannot be beat.  Nice, quite, upcale vibe.  Great for a date or a girls night.

Baxter's bar area.  Great food.  Be sure to hit this on a Monday for 1/2 price wine, or on Wednesday for 1/2 price ""bar"" food.

Ancho & Agave, a great, modern, upscale Mexican place.

Biaggis.  Fantastic Italian restaurant and bar.  They also have a lounge where you can't order food, but is great for just having a drink.

The Mystic (Downtown) Another wine bar.  Great food here.  Need a reservation.  Much more lively that Stave.",t2_96401424,TheDreadnought75,0,1646407258.0,0,t1_hzbq195,hzbq195,True,BerneseMtClimber,t3_t6jidf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/t6jidf/best_bars_and_pubs_in_town_description_of_the/,"Best bars and pubs in town?

We just tried Harmony for the first time and we loved it. My partner just began eating meat again after a year, and admittedly a bit picky, so I was kind of worried, but we absolutely loved everything there. The ice cream dessert alone is worth a visit. My only criticism is that the server cooks your meat at the table for the Korean BBQ. I‚Äôd rather be instructed on the cook times and do it myself, our poor server was literally jogging from table to table. We loved the bulgogi, the pork belly, the steamed eggs, SOOOO many pickled veggies which I love, their kimchi was mouth-watering, and we also got a complimentary soju flight and I think some tteok-bokke.

"I'll swear by the service department at O'Brian Hyundai. I don't even drive a hyundai, either. I've never, *ever* had a bad experience with them, and they've reliably done good work, for cheap, and have even found rebates that kinda-sorta apply to shave off the cost.

Good example was last month; I had a break light out on my VW Jetta. I take it to the VW dealership in town, who after keeping it all day want to charge me $70 for the inspection, and then $390 for replacing the light, the housing, and some wiring they say is part of the problem.

I wind up taking it to O'Brian Hyundai. For $55 they inspect it, replace two bulbs (there was a second I hadn't noticed), confirm the housing and wiring is fine, and throw in a free car wash at the towl-try car wash out by the Normal Walmart. $55 instead of $390.

What's your take on Mandarin Garden comparing it to your favorites. We've enjoyed their dishes a few times, finding it a bit more refined than most. Great family running it too.

Have you been to Harmony Korean off Vets Pkwy / Currency Dr yet ? It was originally built as a Japanese restaurant for Mitsubishi transplants that came to BloNo with the Diamond Star (Rivian) plant. Unique place. Japanese were very picky about their ingredients and preparation. Really curious to hear what it's like now.

The Grand Cafe thing. It's different than it used to be at their original building, esp with the sit down dining areas. Place had its own vibe. Lotta nostalgia for what people remember it to be. Since being sold then moved, its close(ish) but now, not the same. Their egg rolls are King (but they used to have more tiny shrimps and pork bits in the mix, more cabbagey now).

"Grand Cafe is easily the worst Chinese food you can get for miles. I am a freak for Chinese takeout, I have had takeout from as many places in town as I can. I currently swear by Sichuan in Uptown.

If you offered me fresh, free food from Grand Cafe, with the alternative being you offering to let me pay you full price for day-old Ming Shee that you left sitting on your stove overnight, I‚Äôm grabbing my fuckin wallet.

I always see Grand Cafe touted as a popular favorite in the Blo-No Curbside page on Facebook (granted, that‚Äôs mostly where Pop Pop and MeeMaw go for food recommendations just to end up at Denny‚Äôs or Busy Corner, but still‚Ä¶)

My partner and I ordered takeout from GC, I waited in the parking lot for it to be done, I brought it STRAIGHT home (6 minute drive), still steaming, piping hot, but it was absolute, miserable horse shit. We spent almost $40, trudged through as many bites as we could stand, before finally throwing in the towel, tossing it in the trash, and putting a Jack‚Äôs pizza in the oven instead.

The food was flavorless, textureless, colorless(???) and felt like we were eating astronaut food before it had been slurried and forced into a tube.

My all-time favorite Chinese takeaway comes from Golden Kitchen, next to the DMV in Peoria. Nothing else comes close for me, including Sichuan.

"I hired an interior designer to help me prepare my house for sale a few years ago. Because I was downsizing, we focused mostly on cheap easy wins that would still work for me in my new place -- things like flowers on tables, pillows on couches, etc. She only charged me around $150 IIRC for her time and advice.

I'd be happy to give you her name via DM if you're interested.

As for feeling like you're wasting their time by asking for estimates: you're not wasting their time by asking for estimates. They're business people; they want your business. And most businesses expect that a sizable share of estimates they put together won't turn into paying customers, so that's already accounted for in their budgets.

"I was a bullied kid, acted out, defiant, skipped classes, got into fights, refused to do homework, and generally thought the school was teaching mostly useless stuff. I was sent to the RAS SAVE program.  I don't remember what SAVE stands for but it was morning classes, uniform dress code, half days, 5 days a week, no homework, & focused on 4 core subjects. 

It was the best thing for me.  Class was heavily policed, no more bullying, small class sizes.  One year of the SAVE program and I was graduated to the afternoon classes.  No more uniforms but basically the same. 

IMO RAS focused on more important subjects.  I didn't feel like I was learning useless nonsense there.  I appreciated the absence of homework and still feel that homework after 8 hours of school is rediculous.  Part of the program then was to get a part time job which the counselor there helped me do.

I graduated from RAS but my HS diploma is from NCWHS, so no one knows if I don't tell them.  I have nothing but praise for RAS.

Lots to do here, I know plenty of younger couples that have found a nice quality of life here, it's cheaper than many places, safe and with SF, Country, ISU etc the population influences things like decent restaurants, and lots of unique places, not just chains. I think folks forget about  a lot of the great places that are owned locally. Proximity to Chicago/St. Louis/INDY and ease to get there are also nice. I've been here for 15 years (San Diego and Salt Lake City) so yes, the geography is not that great, but I can afford to live here.",t2_11e4xc,drinkinwine,0,1643339218.0,0,t1_huj6tph,huj6tph,True,lowkeyproducer,t3_se9c61,https://www.reddit.com/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/se9c61/considering_moving_to_blono_within_a_year/,Considering moving to BloNo within a year.,/r/BloomingtonNormal/comments/se9c61/considering_moving_to_blono_within_a_year/huj6tph/,3,r/BloomingtonNormal,0,3

I think there are pretty awesome restaurants here - great Indian and Korean restaurants, good Thai food, pop up chicken shop is amazing..but this town is the king of fast food chains..everything but white castle.

"Not sure how hold you are, but definitely keep in mind that BloNo is a big family town. If you are partnered and looking to settle down, it's a great place for that.

Good non-chain restaurants are few and far between. The constitution trail is great but outdoorsy activities are otherwise limited. I've gone ""hiking"" at some of the bigger parks in the area and they're mostly nothing special.

I'm in my late 20s and looking to leave the area within the next 18 months, primarily because I'd rather put money down to buy a house somewhere with more going on.
