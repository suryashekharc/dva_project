">a place that doesn’t have a ton of undergrads

They're a student complex.

Most of the places that have known availability already for August are student-focused. They try to screw students into renewing basically as early as possible under the threat that someone else will take their lease.

Most places around town have a 60-day or 90-day notification clause for moving out. You'll start to see more places come open in the next few weeks for August. 

Without having a place around town that you would prefer, I'd just say to keep an eye out on places that come up for rent on all the usual places.

"Not voting per se sure, but driving the agenda absolutely. And I would say it was not Matlow’s side who has acted childishly throughout this period.

Jack took a photo of the highest ranking local government officials traveling together because she thought it was sketchy. (Debatable, but not childish imo)

A Grow Tallahassee lobbyist sent his sister to sneak photos of Jack and Jeremy at a public event where lots of people were openly taking and posing for photos (childish) and then lied about it after getting caught (more childish).

Ben Pingree had a personal issue with Matlow and made up allegations and filed a complaint that was dismissed, as did same above lobbyist (childish and also just reckless, wasteful of public dollars imo)

Matlow and Porter posed strong and direct questions about how Pingree was hired and how Blueprint conducts major business outside of Sunshine (not childish) and then the majority took their ball and went home, cutting off discussion midway through meeting (childish).

"It was pretty shocking to witness five people gavel out a 12-person meeting while elected officials still wanted to speak about something of major public importance, the whole purpose of the meeting.

There’s a direct connection to the unpopular priorities we’ve seen at Blueprint ($20+ million stadium giveaway, nine figures worth of vanity “gateway” projects which are mostly just subsidies to wealthy interests) and the undemocratic structure of the agency.

The largest land-use decision in recent history (the Welaunee Comp Plan amendments, also linked to a huge Blueprint sales tax-funded road project) was finalized at a vote after the 2020 elections — but *before* the commissioners elected in those elections were seated.

Yes the biggest local government decision in decades was made in part by two former Commissioners (one who was never elected at all) who had just been rejected by the voters by large margins at the ballot box.

Somehow even after that, I was surprised by what happened at this meeting. 

This was the first meeting since the Scott Maddox convictions that heavily involved Blueprint where the people of Tallahassee have gotten to actually explore and discuss the root of the problems that we see at Blueprint.
What happened at the meeting was inappropriate, plain and simple. It sets a dangerous and radical precedent that we simply avoid and cut off conversations that we don’t like.

">For those who don’t subscribe to the Democrat, a rich guy bought the mall where a Kostas has operated for a long time and is kicking out the business. The new property owner refused to be interviewed by the Democrat and instead wrote a response claiming that the business was behind on their rent.

For those who don't subscribe to the Democrat, OP's summary isn't the whole story. Apparently, the owner of Kosta's was operating under an expired lease and was paying only 60% of the lease rate (which was already a low rate). Kosta's opening hours are limited, and the new property owner wants a more active business.

The new property owner also offered the owner of Kosta's a new space to rent.

"$1500 a month can get you a lot in this town. We're talking 3 bedroom houses with a fenced yard are $1400-1500 in some places.

If you're working by the Capitol, you're *very* limited in nearby housing - most of it is still aimed at students (All Saints, Gaines Street areas), is out of your price range (downtown condos) or isn't really that great. There are some hidden gems along Park Ave, east of Monroe, but when they come up for rent they typically go quick ... though to be fair that's almost standard for Tallahassee.

You may be better served though looking up towards Midtown (basically north of where Monroe Street and Thomasville Road split off just north of downtown). You'll have a 5-10 minute commute then, but you would be closer to a lot of the nightlife and could feasibly walk to Publix (grocery store) if needed.

Unfortunately, a private garage is most likely going to be the thing that you won't find in your budget. It's just not common unless you're renting a house. I'm not saying you won't find it, but you likely won't be downtown if you do.",t2_wz3bh,Paxoro,0,1648823660.0,0,t1_i2zkmy3,i2zkmy3,True,optimiism,t3_ttjssd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/ttjssd/apartment_hunt_young_professional/,Apartment Hunt - Young Professional,/r/Tallahassee/comments/ttjssd/apartment_hunt_young_professional/i2zkmy3/,4,r/Tallahassee,0,4

"If there’s one thing you can be sure with Adam Kaye it is that he ALWAYS has a story when it comes to the shady shit he does. More often than not, they’re relatively one-sided excuses and he polices the shit out of any criticism or discourse that makes it out in the world. Btw when Adam uses phrases like “vibrancy“ that’s his codeswitch for black people- and in that article his statement is quoted as saying this well-established, immigrant-owned restaurant of 30 years isn’t “vibrant“ enough for him. He regularly uses this thinly veiled language and it’s gross


Unfortunately, I had a dread something was going to happen to Kostas when Kaye had that BBQ shed parked smack in front of Kosta’s restaurant entrance for the last 1-2 months. Such blatant disrespect & intentional undermining of Kosta’s even being open. The shed blocked his business from view and has made it difficult to actually enter the restaurant. 

BTW Adam Kaye also owns Railroad Square, that bobo Applebees restaurant, Railroad Square Craft House, and has bought a number of warehouses on the Southside since the Pandemic started-- this article is pinnacle example of how many former or current tenants have experienced him.

"Left my wallet there, came back after I realized it was missing- they said they found it and put it in the safe because of the amount of cash that was in there, but that someone came in about an hour earlier and claimed it - using my full name (first,middle,last) I went with my girlfriend and I don’t post shit about where I eat, only my closest friends & family know my middle, and I definitely don’t ask little small red headed kids to go use my full name to grab my wallet for me. Basically whichever staff member found my wallet looked at my name and texted someone to come claim it. They went from being confused and helpful saying they’d check the cameras and see if they can get any information for me. I waited around while they spoke with the manager who was on shift when my wallet was claimed when she came back she went right to being short and saying - “we can’t help you, you’ll need to get  a lawyer or a police report if you want the footage. “

Before this, literally ordered a burrito bowl it was noon, and they were out of black beans. 

Times before that- I’ve ordered burritos for staff - 3 burritos - we received 2 burrito bowls with literally lettuce sour cream cheese and beans- no explanation. I called the door dash driver and they said they were out of everything and it wasn’t his fault. 

Another time I ordered a burrito, with queso/chips & a Mexican coke. When I go to pick it up they just hand me my bag and there was just a burrito bowl… I asked about the Mexican coke and the queso and they were like- “ah were out sorry.

Comcast, unless you are moving somewhere that gets CenturyLink Fiber (if they offer you the 940Mbps download speed)

Eh, point to Comcast on this one too. I have had few reliability issues with Comcast, and honestly their in-store team isn't completely incompetent. But dear God, if Comcast could ever get a move correct on my account...

You'd need to move to either a CenturyLink 'fiberhood' or somewhere with MetroNet. Otherwise your closest bet is Comcast's 900Mbps or Gigabit. But their upload speeds top at 35Mbps versus the speeds you get on fiber.

"Tallahassee realtor here, I’ve had a great experiences with Van Dyke Mortgage (Carrie Edgerson). I usually don’t like dealing with larger mortgage companies, but Rocket is actually not bad at all and I can’t recall a time where I’ve ever had an issue with them. Companies like Chase and Bank of America are god awful for mortgages and a nightmare for everyone.

And like the other person in the comments said, your mortgage will probably get sold at least once. Right after I purchased my house I got sold to Wells Fargo, but was sold again before I even had to make the first payment to Penny Mac, and then after I refinanced when rates dropped to 2.5% it went to SunTrust.

"I think the water dispute had a lot to do with it. George began siphoning off more and more of the water for industrial and agricultural purposes so there is less water flowing out. That goes for many rivers and wetlands that originate in Georgia (and Alabama too). It was a huge national story about Georgia taking water before it reached Florida and states were arguing over who held claim to the water. I had heard the water was brownish but I guess I didn't realize it was coming out of the spring already brown. That is disappointing. I guess runoff from the Apalachicola National Forest is also contributing to it turning brown.

"I'm a Tallahassee Native and I work for Florida State. Not sure what your tolerance for commuting is like but I would recommend getting as far away from campus as you can stand. Everything costs more, you get less space and you will always be subjected to undergrad parties and activities. I might suggest looking at the north side of town, out by Lake Jackson. It's 10 or 15 minutes to campus and you won't have someone living on top of you. Greenwood Hills is nice, so is Harbinwood Estates and Huntington is a huge subdivision. Also check out Indian Head off Apalachee Parkway. There are always houses for sale in there, just get used to living on a Nene instead of a street lol. 

You may be able to find something in your price range in one of them. You could definitely get a house and property in Havana in your price range, you'd just have to drive further into town.

"Always a pleasure to meet another outdoor adventurer in Tallahassee.

Okeeheepkee seems to be very hit or miss. Either you'll see amazing birds or none at all. I heard they recently sprayed something in the water to kill the hydrilla and grass and ever since then the birds have not been around as much. I hope that fades and the birds return once the grass regrows a bit. 

St. Marks is the hands-down best birding spot in the area. I just went kayaking on the East River there on Sunday and I have never not had a blast there. We got some amazing Bald Eagle pics, probably the closest I've ever been to one. There was apparently a single Flamingo that got stuck there after a storm and stayed. I've also heard of rare Roseate Spoonbill sightings there but I think it too may have moved on.

"I live in the area and I can back up what the other person said. The water has been coming back to the lake lately, especially with all the rain we've had. I have seen the most birds out in the lakebed, around the small pools that were left when the lake drained. The lake is quickly returning to an actual, full lake so the opportunities there might be winding down without a boat. It also turns into a mud pit after rain and can be even harder to access. There is also really good birding potential at the landing 30 seconds past Faulk, in between Faulk Drive and Oak Valley Publix. It is the one on the right side of Monroe at that little boat ramp across the Street from Arbor Landing and Lakeside (I think that's the subdivision name). You will likely need a canoe, kayak or boat to get the best access to the birds there.

The **absolute** best place on that side of town for birding is Okeeheepkee Prairie. It is kind of hidden off Talpeco but of all the places on that side of town, it is the best for birding and bird photography. I cannot recommend that place enough. It doesn't seem like much on paper but it has a ton of birds due to its proximity to Lake Jackson, Meginnis arm and the other surrounding bodies of water. It is a tiny park, with a clean walking path circling a pond. I have seen Ospreys carrying Pickerel there, all sorts of Herons and wading birds and even alligators and eagles. Seriously check out Okeeheepkee Prairie for birding. You may have to go regularly to see a good number of species but it is free to get in and easily accessible. My dad was going there every day for a while taking pictures. 

The landing behind Fresh For Less (aka the old Winn Dixie) past the Indian Mounds at the end of Fred George also has pretty good bird presence. I saw a bunch of juvenile Limpkins back there and a few Griebes, Coots, Wood Ducks and Herons. There *was* a large White Ibis population living in the storm water pond next to Canopy Oaks for a while, but I think they have since moved on.

The hydrilla can affect clarity in certain parts of the river, but if you are going to Wakulla Springs State Park, the high dive and swimming area should almost always be clear. The spring's flow tends to wash brown water downriver pretty fast. There has been a lot of rain lately and that can wash mud and soil into the river, reducing clarity.

"Well I've seen several back (and other) surgeries cancelled after body work by a good therapist but if you're dead set on surgery, have at it. You'll always wonder if I was right though.

If you get body work by a therapist educated in Structural Integration you will have your eyes opened and will wonder how in the heck that worked when everything else failed. It's hard to believe until you've seen/felt it yourself. 

When a doctor or PT can't fix an issue they often want to try surgery and if it's a soft tissue issue they are helpless when a good body worker can easily fix it. Go for it. Let the surgeon cut on you and risk partial or full paralysis when it was already proven to you by the PT that it was a soft tissue issue. Otherwise it wouldn't have been solved and slowly returned.

"Visible is most likely a terrible solution for the OP. It's deprioritized Verizon service, in a town where Verizon is overwhelmed at a number of times throughout the day. Add in that it's a 5Mbps speed limit on hotspot, and you're better served by getting Comcast's 100Mbps plan (or paying $10 more to get the 600Mbps plan), or even CenturyLink's $45 one price for life plan that is usually 25-40Mbps. Hell they'd even be better off with the T-Mobile at home plan for $50, since it includes the router and doesn't have the 5 device limit.

> Since the internet in Tallahassee is so awful

Multiple comments say this, but I don't get it. So much of Tallahassee has either CenturyLink fiber, Comcast gigabit, or MetroNet fiber (or more than 1). CenturyLink DSL is a last resort I would think, but it is still available in a lot of places and is tolerable for a lot of people.

"Sciatica can be caused by a herniated disc that is compressing the nerve, which can be clearly identified/diagnosed from an MRI - which is probably what their doctor did if a discectomy/laminectomy was suggested. PT may help resolve herniated discs in some cases, or at least relieve pain, but definitely not always. An honest PT would tell you (they’ve told me) there’s only so much they can do, and if you’ve gone through their PT program and still in pain, it’s time to see a surgeon. Most surgeons will not suggest surgery unless you’ve already tried PT. Additionally, after being diagnosed with a herniated disc I was specifically told by multiple doctors to avoid chiropractors for neck treatment (I honestly think a chiropractor may have caused the injury initially). Surgery should be the last route you take, but if you’ve tried other less invasive options and you’re still suffering, surgery may be worth it.",t2_3xlvbrk8,daydreamingflgirl,0,1648652802.0,0,t1_i2q1la4,i2q1la4,False,throwawayadvice102,t3_tr9w8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tr9w8h/anyone_have_back_surgery_with_dr_albert_lee_at/,Anyone have back surgery with Dr. Albert Lee at TNC here in Tallahassee?

"Thanks, I really appreciate your post.

I identify towards the left on most issues, but sometimes I feel ideologically trapped in the middle. Many on the outer side of both the left and the right seem to see things in black and white in a way which fails to account for the complexities of our society or promote productive discussion.  Discussions can be additionally difficult to have with many on the right who have views based on ""alternative facts"" which aren't grounded in reality.

I think that is exactly in line with your concern about how the left talks about the issue of policing.  There can be a middle ground between the unacceptable authoritarian view that police can do almost no wrong, and the unrealistic view that police should be powerless and that we don’t need police for society to function.

Like you, I also take the view that all violence is bad, but I recognize that it can be necessary to use violence or force to someone causing harm.  It should be used as a last resort, only to the minimum degree necessary, and with transparency, but it is necessary when someone is acting in a way that puts others at risk.  I think it’s a grey area between not limiting police powers, allowing abuses of civil rights, and making police officers unaccountable; or making it so that police officers can’t do their job without fear of career-ending consequences, leading to ineffective police force and a lack of capable people choosing law enforcement as a career.

Unfortunately, I think many people gravitate to one side or the other, leading to reductive black and white viewpoints and disagreement with anything that isn’t exactly in line with their chosen view.   Again, this is just my opinion, but I think that is a lot of what feeds the alarmist posts- people latch on to one fact or facet that fits their preconceived viewpoint and comment based on that, rather than viewing the situation as a whole and within the context it occurred in.

I'm glad you see value in discussing these events as well.  In terms of downvotes or belligerency, I try to recognize that we try all our best, and even when I think someone else is mistaken or their analysis is incorrect or short-sighted, that doesn’t change that that is how they honestly feel.  Similarly, just because I think my viewpoint is sound and well reasoned does not mean it really is- everyone else feels like their viewpoint is correct too.",t2_7wl85kcw,Fight__Censorship,0,1648624410.0,0,t1_i2org42,i2org42,False,Fight__Censorship,t3_tqnv90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tqnv90/tpd_officer_placed_on_leave_after_use_of_force/,TPD officer placed on leave after use of force incident,/r/Tallahassee/comments/tqnv90/tpd_officer_placed_on_leave_after_use_of_force/i2org42/,2,r/Tallahassee,0,2

"Not an expert here, but as far as I know: it varies from department to department, but there is no legal prohibition to people being arrested without being cuffed. However, it almost never happens because it can be dangerous and becomes a giant liability issue.  If a person isn't handcuffed, they can fight with the cop or reach for their weapon.  That creates a situation where everyone involved can be seriously injured or killed.  If a person is arrested not cuffed, then they grab a cop's gun and get shot, the question will be raised ""why didn't the cop prevent this by cuffing them?""

If you aren't fighting or pulling away, you are pretty unlikely to be put on the ground.

If someone's arm can't go back, cops can use two sets of handcuffs strung together or cuff people in the front.  Some will do that and some will force your arm.

Unfortunately, like most other groups, people who are police officers run the gamut from great people to decent people to assholes.  It's up to us as a society to create a framework of rules that limits the ability of assholes to abuse power, but also doesn't prevent good police officers from being able to do their job safely.",t2_7wl85kcw,Fight__Censorship,0,1648604557.0,0,t1_i2ntqss,i2ntqss,False,Fight__Censorship,t3_tqnv90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tqnv90/tpd_officer_placed_on_leave_after_use_of_force/,TPD officer placed on leave after use of force incident,/r/Tallahassee/comments/tqnv90/tpd_officer_placed_on_leave_after_use_of_force/i2ntqss/,1,r/Tallahassee,0,1

"You might get downvoted based solely on the context of the post but I do want to say that I really value having these kinds of discussions and I want to thank you for posting this and defending your viewpoints without being belligerent. 

I worry one of the major problems the left has in regards to the policing dialogue is that we don’t acknowledge that police officers do, to some extent, have to deal with people who are violent. Whether they are actually accomplishing it or not, the police’s fundamental job is to stop violent people from interacting with the rest of society. I think at some point it comes down to a question of how much an officer is willing to risk their personal safety to guarantee the safety of a stranger and everyone is going to draw that line differently. Moreover, I think we can be armchair officers and say what we /think/ we would do but until you’re actually there, you don’t know.

All that is to say, I think there’s a bit of alarmism with the use-of-force stuff. Like, I don’t support violence in any form but one of the definitions of having your own country is having a monopoly on it — literally getting to say what kind of violence is and isn’t acceptable and you have to draw that line somewhere.",t2_p2wj0,Kainimuss,0,1648586889.0,0,t1_i2m47py,i2m47py,False,Fight__Censorship,t3_tqnv90,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tqnv90/tpd_officer_placed_on_leave_after_use_of_force/,TPD officer placed on leave after use of force incident,/r/Tallahassee/comments/tqnv90/tpd_officer_placed_on_leave_after_use_of_force/i2m47py/,4,r/Tallahassee,1,4

Quotes from my post history when police officers have been in the wrong:

>We desperately need police reform both in the country as a whole and locally, and TPD's leadership has policies that are inexcusably non-transparent.

>[Rachel Hoffman] was murdered by two drug dealers during a buy bust in 2008 after being pressured to act as a confidential informant by TPD to avoid prison time for drug offenses.
After her murder and widespread accusations that TPD mishandled the situation, Florida passed Rachel's Law which offered some legal protections for confidential informants in Florida.

"I'm not a lawyer nor a use of force expert, but I personally don't have a lot of issue with this one as it played out, assuming the officer did in fact prevent the arrestee's head and neck from hitting the ground. Even if that is the case, I do have some concerns that it put the arrestee at unnecessary risk.

It's pretty clear the arrestee is resisting lawful arrest without violence.  He is told he is under arrest, and is pulling his arm away.  He is using force to resist, but not violence.  He also is visibly carrying a knife which, although perfectly fine on its own, when combined with him resisting arrest and pulling his arm away, could be articulated as raising a valid concern for the officer that force needed to be used to prevent the physical altercation from escalating towards a deadly force encounter.

In all of the videos, the officer then picks the man up and turns him over in the air.  In the body cam video, it appears he drops him while preventing his neck and head from hitting the ground.  In the bystander video, it looks more like he is dropped, but it still doesn't appear like his head hits the ground.  Considering the fact that he was uninjured and that a drop to the solid ground on your head or neck would cause serious injury, it appears more likely that the officer did drop him in a manner that prevented his head and neck from hitting.

If that is true, it doesn't appear that the officer was attempting to injure the arrestee, nor would he have been acting with malice or reckless disregard for the arrestee's safety.  If the officer had dropped him on his head, that would be a different story.

However, I do see the argument that allowing this would be a bad policy.  It opens the door for a less competent officer to attempt this and drop the person on their head or neck.  It would also open the door for an actively malicious officer to drop or slam someone on their head or neck and claim it was the result of an accident.

I'm very much not a lawyer, but while I could see this resulting in internal discipline for the officer, I wouldn't think this would rise to the level of charging the officer with either battery (as no injury occurred) or assault (as no attempt to injure occurred.)

">In 2018, in specifically the states of Illinois and Missouri, Circle K rebranded many Top Tier fuels (Shell, Phillips 66, Exxon, etc.) to the Circle K brand. Circle K, though when co-franchising with major Top Tier fuel brands, such as Shell or Phillips 66 for example, did sell Top Tier fuel, it currently no longer sells Top Tier fuel at any location that is a Circle K exclusively convenience store and gas station. *Circle K has parted ways with the vast majority of its co-franchised brands, that were Top Tier fuels. Circle K was officially removed from the Top Tier certified retail brands list in 2019. Circle K fuel is definitively the same quality of gasoline that Walmart, Sam's Club, Kroger, Murphy USA sell, to name a few major chains, and is not a Top Tier fuel, As of July 2021.*

"When they announced the move to Atlanta, I wasn't surprised at all. Tallahassee was a very weird place to put a brand new network. Atlanta already has a very strong TV/broadcast world - WarnerMedia, The Weather Channel, and Atlanta's local TV & radio markets to name a few - and let's be honest the available talent or new grad hire/undergrad intern pool in Atlanta is far stronger than FAMU's journalism program or FSU's lack of a real journalism program. It just made sense to be there instead of here.

When that move was announced and there was no real information about what would happen to their Tallahassee location, and then no actual update about the move for months, I began to suspect that it wasn't going to happen after all. I figured they couldn't get the space they needed or some of their talent wanted to stay here. I never thought it was on the verge of bankruptcy.

"I used Two Maids and A Mop for a move-out cleaning last year and they did a good job. On time, made sure they knew what I wanted/needed to be done and confirmed everything with me while I was there to meet them, and called me when they were done. The only downside was that I had to book a minimum 2 hour session and they only needed about 45 minutes. It was $175 or so for that but I know they're cheaper if you book more frequent work.

I would never recommend Molly Maids. I've posted a few times here that their entire setup is a clusterfuck - I contacted them about getting the cleaning, and for whatever reason their Pensacola people called me back, then when I was finally able to reach the Tallahassee people, they only had appointments after my lease ended, so I told them I couldn't use them, and they proceeded to call me multiple times about the appointment I supposedly setup for 3 weeks after I moved out, even after I told them I never set an appointment and that I already had the place cleaned.

"It's easy enough to ignore. Like someone else said it's 10 min to south tally and if you're smart you don't interact with neighbors much anyway.

Fact is with increasing real estate prices woodville and crawfordville are becoming more attractive if you're buying real estate. In 10 years the MAGA thing will balance out with people coming from Tally who are educated. For the cost of a 2 bd single family home in Tallahassee you can have a compound of privacy and acreage. 

It's been mentioned about wakulla springs but a major plus is you're much closer to st marks and fishing.

"Hey kids, I'm late to this thread, but am going to share FL driving and insurance facts for future reference. 

Yes, OP can and should get the FL learners permit while they learn to drive. Learners permit does not require a road test, just a written one. OP, sleep late this morning pls. 

When OP is eligible to test for operator's license, they will very likely be driving a car they don't own - accompanied by the owner who has given permission. The owner's insurance automatically transfers covers permissive drivers and will be primary in the event of an at fault accident.

Florida companies do offer what is known as non owner liability coverage, but it's designed for REGULAR drivers of a non owned vehicle. It's mostly used for those who drive a work vehicle also for personal use, and don't own a vehicle.

"Like another comment said, when I took my test, they didn’t actually get in the car with me. The comments here provide some solid advice. The only thing I would add is to use the smallest car available to you when you go and take the test (as long as you feel comfortable driving a small car vs a larger vehicle). I say this because the road where you do the three-point-turn is VERY narrow. The instructor will have you do the three point turn on this road and, when I went, I was specifically told not to touch the grass and to stay on the paved road. You get points off for touching the grass. I took my parents’ sports utility, and because of how narrow the road is, it was physically impossible to complete the turn without touching the grass or without going over three turns. I didn’t touch the grass, but my three point turn was actually a five point turn, so I did get a couple points off for that. I still passed my test, and really I don’t remember getting many points off for being unable to complete the three point turn on that road.

Investment-wise Frenchtown is your best bet. You can get a decent house around 125-130k and the area is getting gobbled by investors. I expect this area will double in the next 3 years. Levy Park and Midtown are both decent but you won't see too much more of an upside in those areas. IMO Frechtown is great because its in the middle of everything and cheap and getting safer by the minute.,t2_k8iw6eic,JellyDonuts147,0,1647978365.0,0,t1_i1pavj4,i1pavj4,True,Mixed_Signalss,t3_tjjpce,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tallahassee/comments/tjjpce/best_neighborhoods_for_potential_grad_student/,Best Neighborhoods For Potential Grad Student Making Good Salary?,/r/Tallahassee/comments/tjjpce/best_neighborhoods_for_potential_grad_student/i1pavj4/,1,r/Tallahassee,0,1
