"My kids go there, and they have been AMAZING.  My daughter is on a 504 for ADHD, and they were really quick and helpful with setting it up for her after her diagnosis.  They allow her to take breaks when she's feeling over stimulated, as well as let her sit in a more quiet area to do her work so there are fewer distractions for her.  They have been incredibly accommodating for her, and I'm thrilled that she isn't struggling like at her last school.  At her previous school in NC her teacher would have her stay in during recess to finish assignments, which really pissed me off.  Young kids need recess to get all of that pent up energy out to help them focus better, and taking it away as a punishment for not finishing her assignments I felt was inappropriate for a kindergartner.   When I brought up what happened at her old school, her teacher was actually horrified and said that they would NEVER take away recess. Her teacher also noticed she has a slight stuttering, and she was the one to approach me about setting her up with an IEP for speech therapy to help her fluency.  My son also has an IEP for speech, and even though he hit the point of no longer needing it for the pronunciation of words (which he struggled with) they let me decide to keep him going to help with his grammar.

My son started at TE in TK.  By the end of the year he was doing 1st grade math, and reading quite a few sight words.  (I wasn't a fan of his TK teacher's personality, but by golly that woman was able to teach the kids A LOT.  I was really impressed with how much the kids learned by the end of the year.)  He's in kinder now, and already reading above grade level.  They use iReady for the reading and math, which allows the kids to work at whatever level they're at, which means my kids can do work above grade level.  My daughter is in 2nd grade and is reading at a 5th grade level.  My kids are THRIVING there, and their teachers have all been amazing.

Another big thing that I was extremely thankful for was how they handled my son being picked on at the beginning of the year.  A couple boys from his class was teasing him, and calling him names.  One of them even pantsed him during lunch.  My son told me about it the morning after being pantsed.  My husband and I talked to him about what he should do if it happened again, and I sent a message to his teacher about what happened.  The admin acted incredibly quickly, talked to the boys involved, and one of them ended up becoming friends with my son.  Hell, my son ended up going from being teased to being the popular kid in class.  The other kid that wouldn't stop teasing my son was moved into a different class.  I was really happy how quickly they dealt with the issue, and they kept me informed about what they were doing to get it to stop and prevent it from occurring in the future.

Seriously, the school has been amazing.  They are a Title 1 school, which means majority of the kids are on free and reduced lunch, which is probably why the rating is lower.  It also means that because of COVID all of the kids are getting free lunch this year, and last year when they were distance learning we were given pEBT food cards to compensate for the kids not getting the free lunches since they didn't go to school in person.

I also like that they are walking distance from our neighborhood, so I'm saving on gas by walking my kids to school.",t2_4regsm7e,Blue_Bettas,0,1648487129.0,0,t1_i2gj6um,i2gj6um,True,L_xo,t3_tqam7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temecula/comments/tqam7e/elementary_schools/,Elementary schools..,/r/Temecula/comments/tqam7e/elementary_schools/i2gj6um/,7,r/Temecula,0,7
"The school is close to lower cost apartments and has a lot of low income families.  Check out the demographics of the school and compare it to other higher ranking schools.  There tends to be a correlation between these metrics.  It is likely due to lower parental involvement and issues at home.

Tashasips is right in that this school has the headstart program.  This is actually a great program but it does negativitively affect the schools scores.

Your child should get a great education there as the teachers are top notch, the student to teacher ratio is low (19:1) .

My wife and I had a good experience. Oh, cool layout too. We had a two story with attached garage. A room and bathroom downstairs and stairs leading to an open floor plan that had a patio that overlooked the freeway.

"Unfortunately, none of these have firm dates or funding, but I'll try to give you my best guess.  Anza Rd from Morgan Hill to to 79S will most likely remain disconnected for the foreseeable future.  A portion of it is actually drivable dirt road, which homeowners access from Los Caballos Rd, further down 79S.  But to my knowledge, there's no developable land (at high-enough density or commercial zoning) that could be bonded against to pay for improvements, and I imagine that homeowners would oppose any project that could create cut-through traffic.  
  
I'm not sure if this is within scope of your question, but Anza Rd from Morgan Hill to Redhawk will probably never happen.  Part of it is privately owned and not well-maintained, part of it goes through Pechanga, and the challenging terrain would make any connection very expensive.  
  
The Butterfield extension past Murrieta Hot Springs will hopefully happen in the coming years.  This is exactly what Temecula planned for when it had the Sommer's Bend developer install the traffic light at that corner (currently resting in a flashing yellow state).  Riverside County does have plans to realign Butterfield to Auld Road... However, funding will be entirely dependent on whether there's a development project in the county to pay for it.  Last I heard, there was an application submitted for a commercial center near Auld and Purroy, which includes the realignment.  The applicant has requested several extensions from the County (which has so far given approval at every step of the process).  It's unclear when (or if) the proposed development will actually move forward-- the ball is in the applicant's court, beyond the reach of what the public record can tell us at this point.",t2_l7vxy221,David_Matics,0,1648480185.0,0,t1_i2g1xev,i2g1xev,False,LongjumpingShower677,t3_tpspmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temecula/comments/tpspmg/traffic_crisis/,Traffic Crisis,/r/Temecula/comments/tpspmg/traffic_crisis/i2g1xev/,4,r/Temecula,0,4

"The Housing and Circulation elements of Temecula's General Plan have always been linked, going all the back to the early 1990's, shortly after Temecula became a city.  The local roads were engineered to handle capacity at 100% buildout, based on land use / zoning, and the City has been steadily replacing substandard roads that were built prior to the city's incorporation.  Nexus development has historically paid for new roads, with developers stipulated to fund and construct new lanes before they can receive a certificate of occupancy.

City planners try to account for external factors outside city boundaries and within Temecula's ""sphere of influence.""  Unfortunately, a city has limited ways to exert its influence outside of its jurisdiction.  For example, Temecula had to sue Riverside County many years ago, to have the County mitigate the traffic impacts of French Valley.  Temecula also has no say over development in neighboring cities, which contribute 80% - 90% of the traffic on I-15.

The development next to the Duck Pond is unique in that it was approved administratively by the California Department of Housing and Community Development.  As a consequence of recent state legislation, the project was not allowed to be publicly noticed, not required to mitigate traffic impacts, not required to undergo an environmental review, and was essentially beyond our local control.  Temecula will be using General Fund money to make the needed improvements on Ynez between Rancho California and Rancho Vista.  I expect that this will continue to be a source of tension in the years to come, as the State passed a number of laws last year which override local planning in an attempt to solve the housing crisis.",t2_l7vxy221,David_Matics,0,1648434943.0,0,t1_i2e2vgs,i2e2vgs,False,LongjumpingShower677,t3_tpspmg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temecula/comments/tpspmg/traffic_crisis/,Traffic Crisis,/r/Temecula/comments/tpspmg/traffic_crisis/i2e2vgs/,5,r/Temecula,0,5

">However I always remind my self it won’t last and this entire area will be over built sooner or later.

My mindset towards a lot lately has become ""enjoy it while you can because nothing lasts forever."" Eventually things change whether we want them to or not.

Anyway, best example I can think of locally is the Sommers Bend development. I really enjoyed the views from Butterfield Stage, but I also recognize we need more housing and so I'm just glad I got to see that land before homes were built.

I think there's a balance to be struck between protecting land, open spaces, and of course views while still building new homes to accommodate growing populations.

There could also be an argument made that we need to start pivoting towards denser, more walkable areas with better public transportation but that's a whole other can of worms.",t2_4lyj8x09,ReallStrangeBeef,0,1648394237.0,0,t1_i2bl9yt,i2bl9yt,True,YOU_WONT_LIKE_IT,t3_tpjwo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Temecula/comments/tpjwo2/temecula_views/,Temecula Views,/r/Temecula/comments/tpjwo2/temecula_views/i2bl9yt/,14,r/Temecula,0,14

"IMO this depends on where exactly you are and when your home was built.  We do have a fairly big fault (the Lake Elsinore Fault) which is capable of 6.5-7.5 ... for reference, Northridge was 6.7.  In 1910 there was a magnitude 6 just north of the lake.  That likely wouldn't have done much to newer construction around the greater Temecula area though.

&#x200B;

After Northridge, construction laws changed and houses are much better prepared to handle earthquakes in the magnitude 6-7 range.   All this said.  I do not have earthquake insurance.  Mostly because the cost was more than my normal home insurance and the deductible was high enough I wouldn't be able to afford it.  Since the values went up so much in the last few years my equity has also gone up so I am reconsidering it now.

"My son used to go to an elementary school where the teacher had a entire ""shrine"" in the corner. I thought that was not allowed? I would have complained but I was stuck between a rock and a hard place - the teacher was a good special ed teacher and rocking the boat for a child who was already struggling to stay at the school would not have ended well.

We moved to the Lake Elsinore USD and that seems a lot better - in fact, though people look down on LE and Wildomar, I think that might actually be racism surfacing rather than the place being ""bad"". I feel it's an improvement anyway, and we're not far from anything like malls, Old Town, wineries, etc.

I started exploring - cause lets be real here - it's pretty freakin sweet from here we can hit a beach or mountain or the desert.  So much to explore - thats how I've been getting out.

"As someone who grew up here, 25, moved here when i was 14, try to stick near the north side near murrieta/french valley zone for the mall. I can't express how much my social life relied on walking and cycling to the mall from Chaparral HS and Day Middle, anyone and everyone would congregate there after school and on weekend. The south sides reall nice in terms of houses and local parks but it's an ocean of nothing for kids. The nearing things in that area are grocery store shopping plazas after a long time of walking or cycling. Same kind of goes for the French Valley/Dutch Village/Winchester area up the big hill right past Chaparral, it's an ocean of houses with nothing much but the schools and parks. Even living by the Rancho Cal/Margarita intersection is a really good spot but once you get to Temecula Parkway it's kind of socially isolating outside of school. Especially if you're near Great Oak/Pechanga. For wineries/breweries/bars they're like littered across the entire city left and right, if you just take a main road and go a little further out you'll always find them! Adult and kid fun can always be had in Old Town by the way, during the day theres the retro candy shop, Pennypickles, the local theater, tons of seasonal events, and in the evening it's a walkable bar hop zone.

"I used to live in the Central Park community for nine years. The community, under normal circumstances, was underneath the take-off path of every aircraft from Cessna to Leer jet at full throttle.

At some point after a couple of months, you just stop noticing the sound. It becomes background noise like yard work, fire engine/ambulance sirens from the near by fire station, the ebb and flow of traffic in the area, etc. 

Central Park, by the way, is a great low tax neighborhood. There’s been a lot of turn over recently with the inflated property values and such, but when I lived there (as recent as 2021), the neighborhood showed such great pride of ownership. 

I would imagine the noise from the airport is much less over in the Spencer’s Crossing neighborhoods because they are across from the airport, not directly in the flight path. Even homes in the Benton rd area don’t experience much noise pollution from the airport because the engines are at low throttle during landing.

Also, there are no restrictions on the airport. Planes can take-off and land 24/7. I’ve never been woken up due to this, but I have been awake at 0430 and heard planes taking off on a few occasions.

Anyhow, that’s my take on it.

My in laws live directly across the street I am assuming where you are looking at buying and I have never heard any noise that I would not hear any where else. I live across town and feel like I hear more noise from them trying to get to that airport than I have when at their house. I actually can hear planes flying over me while writing this lol. I believe they may have restrictions on when you can and cannot fly out of that airport as I have never seen or head any planes taking off at early or late hours.

Sounds like a bunch of crap to me. They can pull someone over for just about anything - ""following too closely"" can certainly be twisted into some interpretation of reckless driving.

I live in French Valley.  We use Temecula’s school district.  So the schools are good and area is fairly crime free.  You can still get a nice single story 3br house with a small yard for the mid to upper 500’s.  Not sure for how much longer though.  I don’t think you can find homes in Temecula for the 500’s anymore.  Unless it’s a real “fixer upper”.  I definitely prefer French Valley over Hemet or Menifee.

"I think the Fresno area would also work for you in CA.. One of my employees just bought a house in the 500s up there.  We just moved to Murrieta from Orange County, CA and it's VERY affordable down here compared to OC.  

Also #1, don't expect the market is going to cool any time soon.. I'd buy ASAP if I were you.  

Also #2, be very careful looking in the Murrieta/Temecula area as new homes or newer construction can carry quite a premium when it comes to the property taxes.  If you're interested in a house, look up their property bill on the Riverside county tax collector's office and look at how the taxes are calculated.  There's usually a 1.% tax rate that you'll want to re-calculate at the same 1.% x your purchase price plus some properties carry special assessments that tend to be flat $##.  Add the two together to determine what your new annual taxes will be and factor that into your decision.  Older homes that are 20 or more years old tend to carry very little if any special assessments whereas newer homes will carry more.  DO NOT USE THE EXISTING ASSESSED TAX AMOUNT AS AN ESTIMATE OF WHAT YOUR FUTURE TAXES WILL BE OR YOU'RE LIKELY TO GET BURNED. 

Also #3, keep an eye on the HOA fees as that will also add a significant amount to your mortgage payment.

"I think most people on reddit are fairly liberal, I'm pretty conservative in some areas and pretty democrat in others. I'm black in my 20s and have been in temecula for about like 5 years or so. Everyone's just nice, you can kinda see the blend of people who live here, but everyone kinda makes it work. I think when covid hit allot of the more conservative younger families and single people just left to other states as California is the most left leaning politically really and most expensive, so now there's just older people left. But Temecula is growing, but like every other city in California it's probably gonna turn more and more blue.

Yes and no. We bought in 2008 at bottom of market. It only stayed bottom for a short time due to foreign capital buying up real estate. Californias market is unique.

"Your down payment is excellent and you should be able to get a mortgage in the $2200 range.  Working from home is the key to living a happy life here.

You will love it here. It's unbeatable quality of life in most regards.

I just visited Florida to visit my wife's family in the Bradenton area.  I was SHOCKED how expensive homes were plus there running costs. Water bills are $300/m.  Gas is almost double. Electricity rates are higher. The propert tax rates were also very high.

No state income tax was the only benefit but after everything considered, there wasn't much of a difference in total costs.
