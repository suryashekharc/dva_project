Cycling PEI might be worth contacting as well, they might be able to point you toward some more affordable rentals.

Another option, though it may be a bit unconventional, is to post on some of the Facebook cycling groups for the area.

"It's a shame that there is no objectivity here. Luckily it's only online and not in real life.

PEI infections are at an all-time high and are higher than in other jurisdictions with no restrictions. This is also seen in Scotland (Mask) vs England (Unmask). No difference in infections, hospitalizations, or deaths. Very similar rates.

On the mask debate, the science is clear it has almost zero impact. The only use, unfortunately, is to virtue signal, and divide people... but this is only online behavior. 

When you come out of the basement, and go out in the community to eat, drink, play... there is very very little concern for masks or distancing... time to end the theatre, because it's not reflective of reality.

"r/place is a recurring April 1st reddit event.  


It involves a large, blank canvas. Every reddit user account of a certain age has the ability to place 1 pixel every 5 minutes.  


It becomes part art project defining the year, part competition between different groups trying to represent themselves through a logo or some other image.  


Its very interesting to me, like a digital graffiti wall.  


OP is recruiting users to represent Canada, who is currently a little unrepresented on the board (interestingly, at the time of this comment, the Quebec mural is larger than then Canada one).  


It's nothing to be concerned about, and not even surprising considering this is reddit, and many larger subs have rally posts just like this.

"The Soviet Union is a country, not a labor organization that does collective bargaining with a company….bro.

The union your are describing is not a country either, so I assume you are just spewing some nonsensical theory you have romanticized.

Unions, like all things have the capacity for bad. Most private companies invest in employees if they want to keep them. Heck most tech and stem companies bend over backwards to offer great benefits, education and stronger pay. This idea only unions are fantastic for all is absurd.

"Bro, I literally just did in the comment you responded to... You said not all unions are great and I agreed giving the soviet union as an example.

Unions do not exist to negotiate with large companies, they exist to prevent employers from mistreating their employees while offering fair wages to all employees. Because of unions, we now have a minimum wage, whereas before, we would have been paid pennies. Unions are also responsible for the two day weekend. Before the two day weekend there was only one day of rest which was the sabbath.

While a union does pay all employees at different levels depending on the duty, there are multiple scales in that level which guarantees a wage increase. On the other hand, unions offer courses that are available to take and offer higher payment for those with higher education. There are also plenty of job opportunities that are available so the argument that high performance individuals aren't incentived to work hard is kind of a straw hat argument.

It's rough that paramedics aren't being paid better wage for the work that they do, and I'm fully behind them for a proper wage increase but don't tell me that between Medavie and CUPE, its CUPE that is holding back their wages.",t2_9ffi0,Merick24,0,1648763696.0,0,t1_i2wl56o,i2wl56o,False,[deleted],t3_tsc9cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/tsc9cp/pei_premier_tests_positive_for_covid/,PEI Premier Tests Positive for COVID,/r/PEI/comments/tsc9cp/pei_premier_tests_positive_for_covid/i2wl56o/,1,r/PEI,0,1

"If in warranty: pick a car brand that is on the Island. Paying a toll just for servicing will suck. 

If not: do what you like, but keep in mind some shops may not be as experienced with a ""luxury"" brand. 

SUV vs Car for potholes doesn't really make a lot of sense when most crossovers are around the same height at this point.

Go with a smaller rim size and larger tire for more rubber cushioning to minimize impact of bad hits. Also a set of steelies; unlike alloys on impact, they bend instead of shatter. Might be repairable and safe a few bucks in an unlucky long run. 

AWD is not all wheel stop. Pick your preferred driveline, if the weather is bad enough, most businesses will be closed anyway. If living in an area prone to icing over, like with bridges, studded tires will help, at the cost of noise. 

Assuming the SUV costs more, he just wanted to bigger commission by playing with fears.

"I drive a Nissan Micra and also cycle - I'm pretty intimate with road conditions. We're a developed province just like everywhere else in Canada, our roads are not as bad as your dealer is making them out to be, and you certainly don't ""need an SUV"" to drive here.

Sure there are some dirt roads you wouldn't want to try without 4 wheel drive, especially in the spring runoff season when everything is wet and soft. Once they dry out there can be deep ruts from farm equipment using them, but I've been down lots of them in the Micra with no problem. I lost a wheel cover once. But these are back roads - you wouldn't find yourself driving on one unless you meant to be. They're also very narrow - I've done an Austin Powers 20-point u-turn on them in the Micra if they're blocked (big puddles, fallen trees), I don't think you'd be able to turn around in a larger vehicle and would have to back out.

All of the roads you'd drive on to get anywhere are paved just like everywhere else in the country, or there might be some gravel sections but those are properly graded and maintained. We get potholes like everywhere else in the country and they get filled and patched at about the same rate, and they're definitely cleaned up by July - that's tourist season. Studded tires are popular so many of the busy roads develop noticeable ruts, and they become a hydroplane risk when it rains, but if these are deep enough for your car to bottom out then you shouldn't be driving it on public roads at all.

tl;dr: your dealer is full of it, and trying to scare you into buying a more expensive vehicle you don't really seem to want.",t2_5a9y0,ivanvector,0,1648646096.0,0,t1_i2plwjj,i2plwjj,True,thisisjas9n,t3_trypyp,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/trypyp/driving_cars_on_pei/,Driving cars on PEI,/r/PEI/comments/trypyp/driving_cars_on_pei/i2plwjj/,7,r/PEI,0,7

"I mean, if you're in the city or something, you'll probably be fine. If you're intending to drive out to the sticks, especially something not on the main highway? 

I don't think you need a full blown SUV, but, there's a lot of SUV's and Trucks out here for that reason. A lot of roads rurally are uneven, sometimes for years, they get potholes but they generally do fill these. You 100% shouldn't lower your vehicle here. If you do so in say ontario, sure, be our guest. But, the last lowered vehicle I saw here had damage from hitting stuff.

There are definitely dirt roads here, but, they're not that common. You either live on one or you don't. 

Yeah, we get a solid amount of snow here. Also, we don't believe in snowfences here, so, you can get a lot of snow drifts across the highway. I'm talking like inches to sometimes feet snowbanks. Contrary to this, they plow pretty religiously during the winter.

To counter this point though, I see a number of other co-workers make it into work here just fine with compact sedans and such most of the time.

Something with a skinny sidewall isn't quite great here either. I've seen people blow tires in cars like that. I hit something bad enough to ruin my steering shaft in a vic, but not blow a tire. 

Honestly though, if I had to buy a vehicle tomorrow? I'd probably try to get something like another vic, or consider some sort of Suv or something with solid suspension tbh. I live rurally.

"Couple things:

1) Welcome to the Island!

2) Before we even get into the legalities of you having to buy your own appliances, do they not understand that if you buy them then you're taking them with you when you leave, thus having to get new ones later?

3) Check your lease agreement for any mention of appliances that are included, as well as (if you can find it) the advertisement from when you found the apartment. If the offered apartment had them included, then it's on them to provide / maintain them.

Depending on how maliciously compliant you want tog et, buy really expensive ones and then provide them with the receipts for reimbursement.

4) Who is the landlord. Post their names, so we can shame them.

5) Check out [https://registry.myoldapartment.org/](https://registry.myoldapartment.org/) if your place is on there (to find out if they are also breaking that law.

"The thing is it didn't really hold economic value any more as an active rail system, its value was in the property it owned, rolling stock that could be repurposed, and materials that could be sold for scrap. Passenger service ended in the 1960s since everyone started buying their own cars after WWII, and industry had been shifting to just-in-time operations (better serviced by trucks) for decades before our freight service ended.

Also it's not like it was sold off by the province to make a quick buck - it wasn't our asset. The whole system belonged to Canadian National, and they had been wanting to shut it down since the 1970s and put resources into their ferry services (for trucks) instead.

The former alignments wouldn't have been suitable for modern passenger rail anyway - with all the curves it would be too slow, and there had been no direct connection between Charlottetown and Stratford since the 1950s. A heritage railway to Cavendish would be interesting, except there's no route: it would be new construction, and that kind of defeats the nostalgia value.

Also, don't discount the value of bicycle tourism. A study by Atlantic Canada Trails on trail-related tourism estimated the economic impact in 2007 from Confederation Trail tourism at $1.6 million in PEI GDP (after discounting interprovincial effects) and about 150 seasonal jobs. Quebec's Route Verte is a much larger cycling network than the Confederation Trail, but in 2015 it was estimated that it generated $700 million just from bicyclists, which translated to $100 million in provincial tax revenue.",t2_5a9y0,ivanvector,0,1648564830.0,0,t1_i2kic0x,i2kic0x,True,Leo-J-Covo,t3_tqiy4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/tqiy4l/would_it_really_have_been_that_detrimental_to/,Would it really have been that detrimental to keep the train?,/r/PEI/comments/tqiy4l/would_it_really_have_been_that_detrimental_to/i2kic0x/,3,r/PEI,0,3

Thank you for your good wishes ☺️💖

About your question, it's a big no, at least for me. Not only you need the work permit to get a job legally but that would also look extremely suspicious to the officers in the border and if they investigate and find out your real intentions, you could get sent back, both of you. When you apply for your tourist visa or study permit you're basically signing that what you stated there is the truth and if they find out you lied about it you could get sent back, visas denied and probably face a ""punishment"" like not being able to go back to Canada for X amount of time. 

I don't think it's worth the risk specially because you're already on your way to get there as a student and he's in a good position to get a work offer the legal way. You still have time to apply for his permit and get there without any issues, don't risk it 💖.",t2_3www41k2,Hallehallehalle1,0,1648434202.0,0,t1_i2e1ej3,i2e1ej3,False,tadpowl,t3_t7f8ni,https://www.reddit.com/r/PEI/comments/t7f8ni/moving_to_pei/,Moving to PEI?,/r/PEI/comments/t7f8ni/moving_to_pei/i2e1ej3/,1,r/PEI,0,1

> Some Islanders will still see some money in their pockets from a carbon pricing rebate — up to about $140 a year, depending on household income — but it's significantly less than in other provinces.

"I went to Halifax for my LASIK surgery over 20 years ago.  I was nearsighted.  It was amazing to be able to read and see things in more detail, without contacts or glasses. I just had my eyes tested and my distance vision is still great but reading and other activities require glasses. I'm able to purchase 'readers' for this at about $10 a pair in many locations on the Island.  

  
I see there are LASIK surgeries on the Island, but I have no idea how often this is done. I can't imagine there are that many Islanders getting LASIK on a daily basis. Or perhaps they just do referrals? Or 1 or 2 days a week? If it can be done on the Island, there are expenses you likely won't need, but I've listed what I had to cover, jic.  


The clinic I went to in Halifax only did LASIK. The 1st day was the exam to see if I was a good candidate, if I wasn't - I would have been done and on my way home.  The next day was surgery and the 3rd day was checking to see if everything was good, so we could travel home.  (You need a driver, as you won't be allowed - legally - to drive for a day or two).    
Note: after surgery I went back to the motel and slept until supper time.   


Expenses for you and a driver are included in the link below.  Keep track of your mileage, and basically every single cost for you AND your driver. Gas is covered. Even a vehicle breakdown on the way to or from your LASIK is allowed.  Meals for you and your assistant/driver are covered.  Motel/hotel costs are all covered, etc.  You can also talk directly to Revenue Canada to get a handle on other expenses you may incur, including parking fees, Confederation Bridge or Ferry trip. Keep every receipt and claim it when you do your next tax return.  


""To claim transportation and travel expenses, all of the following conditions must be met:  
""Substantially equivalent medical services were not available near your home.   
""You took a reasonably direct travelling route.  
""It is reasonable, under the circumstances, for you to have travelled to that place to get those medical services.  
""If a medical practitioner certifies in writing that you were not able to travel alone to get medical services, you can also claim the transportation and travel expenses of an attendant.""

"Summerside:

* Brothers 2 - family/pub style, good fish and chips, nothing you couldn't get in AB but alright.

* Arigato - probably the best sushi on the Island. My wife is from Vancouver and says it stacks up against West coast stuff, the people who run it formerly ran a restaurant there. Again, probably nothing you couldn't get in Calgary, but it's good.

* South Central - Good sandwiches/lunch

* Sissy's Kitchen in the mall - sleeper place, super good Vietnamese food and really really sweet people who run it.

* Evermoore - 'gastropub' kind of place, good food, don't go for the beer.

* Island Stone (Kensington) - another gastropub, good food and a nice atmosphere

* CKB Cafe (Kensington) - new and really good coffee and brunch, definitely worth a trip.

Charlottetown: 

* Churchill Arms - really good pub style curry, good atmosphere.

* Himalayan - North Indian food, super good, great folks who run it.

* Slaymaker & Nichols - small plate/bite style food, had some good experience but haven't been for over a year so not sure what the scoop is now.

* Cedar's - Lebanese food, go and get the chicken schwarma, some baklava and Lebanese coffee.

* El Sabor - authentic Mexican food, only available on Saturdays at the Ch'town farmers market

* Spicy Chef - some good items, I think run by the Himalayan folks.

* Point Prim Chowder House - worth a trip if you want something with a nice view, may not be open when you're here.

* Papa Joes - kinda like Brothers 2, family dining style but good food.

"There are two groups on the Island now divided by gender. There is GEBIS which is the Monks and there is GWBS which are the Nuns. The Nuns are just outside Brudenell and the Monks are in little Sands. It's basically a religious boarding school. If you wanted to join them you apply and then give up your worldly possessions and start studying The Five Great Treatises. Which are the holly books of Tibetan Buddhism. If I remember correctly from their open house they basically need to memorize these texts and it can take over 7 years to finish their studies. Now as far as the language issue I think the problem is that we are viewing them as ""immigrants"" who are looking to start a life here which isn't really the case. They come here to study Buddhism and live an isolated life with no intention of integration into society at large. Now there are some valid criticisms (land use, the age of some of the students, families of members moving to the area and driving up house prices) and they are definitely a little culty but at the end of the day they are Buddhists trying to live an isolated life of peace and really aren't harming anyone.

"Please tell me why our politicians and decision makers are still fear mongering covid when hospitalizations and deaths are plummeting because 84% of people are vaccinated? I bet you can’t cuz you don’t understand epidemiology beyond what your spoon fed. New variants aren’t caused by people not getting the vaccine??? Viruses are always evolving in order to combat the immune system of its host. Not only that but these variations aren’t even created in North America where a large majority are vaccinated and have been vaccinated for a while now. We’ve known since day one masks and lockdowns don’t stop the spread of covid. China follows a “0 covid policy” which continually infringes on the rights of their people for the sake of controlling covid. And to what success? None. They still have to lie and conceal there true numbers. So why are our leadings looking to china as a shining example? Because it’s a kickass way to consolidate power and pump money into spaces we don’t need it to go. You look at things 2 dimensional. But with any kind of critical thinking you’d see the pandemic and it’s mandates for what they rlly are. Scientifically baseless procedures which have caused more harm and damage to our people and economy then if we just let covid go wild. So if you wanna “follow the fucking science” be my guess but do not attempt to bring people down with you. Hell the chief medical advisor for the United States didn’t even believe in masks before the pandemic💀 and when we was asked about his change of heart all he gave was some half asses excuse along the lines of “I didn’t wanna inform our people about the benefits of n95 masks so our medical system wouldn’t be short stocked” and he only gives quick and short answers to why he never condemned cloth masks until the media started pointing out their ineffectiveness. The fact we’re pushing for a fourth covid dose while less the 10% of the worlds poor have even had there first dose is absurd. if as you say covid Variants are caused by people not being vaccinated soon enough then it’s crazy that our government doesn’t send vaccines to these poorer countries cuz in return we’d lower the risk for new, reinfectious  variants which would further improve our situation.

Thats odd. Chances are it might've been a poor quality PCR done. Usually with the Rapid tests you need a high viral load for the Rapids to detect it meaning they are less accurate.

">Apparently I’m misinformed about my life, and I’m pretty sure my phone number started with 416.

First things first, there is zero need to get defensive. Secondly, I never said you were ""misinformed about your life"" 
 but I'm going to further breakdown why I disagree on each of your points (hint: a lot of it comes down to *choice* and *options*).

>If I lived in a more vibrant neighborhood with more restaurant choices, like closer to downtown, then meals would have probably gotten cheaper. 

Well as someone who has lived in the following neighbourhoods:

1. Jane/Finch
2. Chinatown
3. Baldwin Village
4. Woodbines Gardens
5. Etobcoke by the airport

I don't know what you are talking about here. Half of those are not even close to downtown, and on that note, I actually find that eating out is cheaper the further from downtown you go; at least until you hit the suburbs. 

Like I'm sorry, I'm not saying you don't find it expensive, but I do think that the reason you do is because you either have a warped interpretation of what ""expensive"" means in terms of going out to eat, or you were somehow picking exlusively overpriced restaurants. I work in an office for a Toronto based company where there are many of our staff that are GTA transplants, and one thing they all agree with me on is that eating out is on average anywhere from 10-20% more expensive. So this is either you making terrible dine-out choices, or you're being Adishonest. A literal quick Google search of GTa restaurant menu prices will prove this.

>Plus more walking instead of transit/parking/delivery fees would have been great.

Again I only had a car for about a year of my near 10 of living in the city. I literally got rid of it because it was almost always quicker and cheaper to take transit, and when transit couldn't fit my needs, zipcar and uber filled the gap easily, and I was still paying less per year than I would owning a car even here on the island. Short of having kids (eventhen, many families pull it off just fine) or a job that requires a car (delivery driving, on-site sales/service, etc.) having a car in Toronto is in no way, shape, or form a requirement and is nothing short of a status symbol, convenience *choice*, or required due to a mobility issue. Did you need a car, or did you want one? 

>For parking, what really blew up my budget was the cost to park at the building I lived in. As far as I could tell this is common in the 416. Its not common in Charlottetown. Those couple hundred per month add up.

See above. Owning a car here is essential. Having one in Toronto is predominatly not. 

>So Toronto cost at least $3k more per year to have a car which if I stayed in TO long enough might have been given up, but that wasn’t the case.

So again, a choice. You *chose* to have your car because of ""time"" or some shit, which I'm sorry makes no sense to me. All this comment tells me is that you lived in Toronto for like a year and without learning a single fucking thing about life there, decided it was too expensive because you came in expecting things to be a direct correlation with life on the island. You need to make adjustments when you move dude, regardless of where you move to, but especially when it's from somewhere small to somewhere big. 

This is clearly a case of someone who expected to move to the big city and have everything just work out without any effort on their part to learn how to adjust to their new environment. Your experience is 100% on you. Toronto has many issues, some of which I have personally been very vocal about, but none of the points you've mentioned are any of them.

God speed.

EDIT - so you mentioned this in your first sentence:

>I’m pretty sure my phone number started with 416.

But if you lived in Tooronto in recent history, which your reply indicates is the case, this is so incredibly unlikely.  They haven't even been close to recyling abandoned 647 area codes  since introducing 437, let alone 416.

"Boardwalk is good as others have said. Can be windy, though.

Confederation Trail is great if you're in Charlottetown. I don't know what the trail is like far outside of town for strollers, but within the city limits it's cleared and decently sheltered (except for the more open parts by the Experimental Farms).

Out by the airport there are paved walkways along the road that are good - I mean I guess you could still call them sidewalks, but they're set out farther from the road than a sidewalk so they're safer than a regular sidewalk, and are paved instead of concrete pavers.

Same for Stratford, it has some good walking spots along the road as you get away from the bridge and go down into Keppoch.

Would not recommend a lot of the nature trails -- especially out in Bonshaw -- unless you like to baby stroller parkour.

"Just that they don’t test people who were positive in the last 90 days for that reason. 

I can try and find an actual scientific study on that if you’d like once I’m off of classes for the day. But good point to add that it is primarily speculation at the moment and I will amend my comment.

Edit: To follow up, PCR tests, not RATs, should not be taken following a previous infection as it can result in a false positive. I was mistaken in my original comment as such does not apply to the OP’s case. The RAT after having a positive should not create a false positive.

Couldn’t find a link to an article that isn’t blocked by an academic paywall but here is a clip from a doctor on Good Morning America from about a month ago. I’ll try more later to find where this claim comes from.

Most suggestions from other times of the year are probably applicable, except for some obviously seasonal ones. 

There is a lot to experience, so it would depend on your interests and location! Have you been to PEI before? What do you like to do? Where will you be located?

Charlottetown has a lot of great restaurants, and the food diversity has really expanded the last 5-10 years. There are a lot of really good microbreweries (Moth Lane, Lone Oak, Village Green, Upstreet, Copper Bottom, Bogside; to name a few) and a cidery (Red Island Cider). 

There are usually live shows to be found although restrictions are still being felt here. It is nice to sightsee by car. Route 20 is a really beautiful drive with lots of beaches and bays/rivers to see. The dirt roads are usually terribly muddy this time of year so some beaches and ""off the trail"" spots can be difficult to access.

Bonshaw and Strathgartney provincial park have really nice trails for some outdoor options.
