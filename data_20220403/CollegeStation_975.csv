"I can't speak to their fiber yet.  If that is what you have available I'd give that a go.


I don't recommend their dsl service, it is slow and not as reliable.  


Like the other comment said most router equipment that comes from the isp is usually pretty bad especially wifi on them.  Deepening on coverage area triband mesh wifi is the way to go for larger areas of coverage.  


Lastly there are other providers aside from frontier and Suddenlink.  Wirestar, vxv, brazos wifi, CEO.

"No experience with Frontier, but I'll offer this much:

If you're with Suddenlink and using / renting their Altice modem-router unit, it's basically going to need rebooting eight times a day on a good day.  Known issue: it's trash.

That problem can be fixed by using decent equipment of your own: a bit expensive, but mine ran just fine after upgrading to my own equipment.

ETA: I'd recommend the expensive but excellent Arris Surfboard modem and a bottom-of-the-line cheap Linksys router.   Even the cheap Linksys stuff is reliable to get you your wi-fi, most have ethernet-out ports as well as in, and you can get one for under $40.  I begrudged the expense, but I think I've had to reboot twice in three months.

Once you get your modem, write the help desk and let them know you've got it and ask them to register the MAC address (printed on the modem and usually on the box or documentation).   Also request them to take the rental fee off your bill.

Then drop their deplorable kludge at the Suddenlink office, where there's a box where you  can dump it.",t2_d0fn8q,Futueteipsum7,0,1648871625.0,0,t1_i32jlzx,i32jlzx,True,Sufficient_Tea_3020,t3_tu8o5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeStation/comments/tu8o5a/is_frontier_a_good_internet_provider_in_college/,Is Frontier a good internet provider in College Station?,/r/CollegeStation/comments/tu8o5a/is_frontier_a_good_internet_provider_in_college/i32jlzx/,7,r/CollegeStation,0,7

There are local things to enjoy, and though a lot of people will complain :) if you're someone who tries to make the most of things, you'll find things to do here and it's growing enough (and quite rapidly) that you'll have things to do. But it really depends on how you like to spend your time, your interests and values (small southern town in the Bible belt, which is exactly some people's cup of tea and exactly not others.

"First Friday: The first Friday of every month in downtownve Bryan, there's live music food and events.

Farmer's Market: Every Saturday up til noon I believe, in   downtown Bryan, there's a ton of stalls with local vendors and sometimes music and raffles.

Wolf Pen Creek Park: There's usually a big billboard out front showing upcoming events being held. Usually it's a family friendly event for holidays or Music events held in the amphitheater.

Rudder Theater: A&M often has plays and events happening cheap for the public to attend.

Lake Atlas/The Stella: I can't remember but it's like every month, there's a weekend of family friendly music, food,  and local vendors. There's also a coffee shop near by and a children's museum.

Rellis 4th of July: The rellis campus holds a big fireworks  where families can come out for free and experience it. it's very fun to see everyone come together and celebrate.

Festivals: Downtown Bryan, annual chilli fest, wine tastings, art crawl, and other events.

Hmmm.... I'm trying to recall what else there is. Besides this, there's tons of parks and trails to go walking on. The University hosts plenty of concerts,  theater performances, and special speakers. There's always sports at the University going on. As well as huge games of children's sports competing at parks.

"It depends on when you'll be here and what you're looking for. Do you want to experience typical American/Texan/Aggie activities? Or are you just after having a good time with your friend?

If you're wanting Aggie experiences, I'd recommend:

*  Hurricane Harry's - It's a country dance hall that is a quintessential Aggie spot. Even if the music and dancing isn't your style, you can grab a few drinks and enjoy the people watching. It is on the end of our bar district, Northgate, so you could swing by for a bit and then move on to bars that are more your speed. Saturdays are also free admission for 21 and up!
* The Dixie Chicken - While we're talking about drinking, The Dixie Chicken (colloquially referred to as just ""The Chicken"") is the most well-known bar in town and has very stereotypical ""Texan"" vibes. It's more laid back and a great place to start a night of drinking. Grab a pitcher of beer, carve your name into one of the tables, maybe play a little pool, and then move on to other bars in the area.
* Catch some type of sporting event - if coming sometime this semester, watch a baseball game at Blue Bell Park. If you're coming in the fall, see if there is a football game in town the weekend you're here. Football is more pricey but well worth the experience. 

If you just want to do something fun with a friend:

* [The Break Room](https://www.thebreakroombryan.com/) - pay $10 and get a room and a bucket of breakables to smash. Awesome stress reliever and a lot of fun with friends.
* [Big Shots](https://bigshotsgolf.com/locations/bryan-tx/) - golf driving range where you can order food and drink while you play.
* Check [this](https://www.destinationbryan.com/events/) website as well as [this one](https://visit.cstx.gov/events/?view=grid&sort=date) for events happening in the area and see if any peek your interest!

"I live in Castle Gate and spend most of my days doing art in the garage and walking my dogs. So I meet many of my neighbors here that work at A&M. I hear the same stories over and over again. Unfortunately it is not just the spouses of the college, but same holds true for the financial companies, hospitals ,as well as the tech companies

I can not speak with a 100% certainty of course it is just what I have learned living here from neighbors.

Just a side note about me.

I myself can not seem to get a small business off the ground here. I have to do business in Houston, DFW, and Austin. What I do for work is family entertainment & events, educational entertainment for school assemblies, libraries, and use to do birthdays as a magician. Families here are not doing in home entertainment as they prefer Grand Station from what I gather.

The other complaint I hear from small business owners I have met. Is the students take the side gigs that spouses of the university faculty are trying start up. For example dog walking by the veterinarian school students. Don’t get me wrong here I applaud those students who are working to get their bills paid. They do the job cheaper than a small business professional can afford to.

Even in doing birthday parties I ran across at first Friday a small group of magicians who have a club at A&M. Who go out for very cheap to birthdays when they get them or for free in some cases. This is what they told me while showing me their latest card trick. This was before Covid. 

I have bills like everyone else so I can not do that lol.

This is just my limited experience here as a transplant to take care of my wife’s parents. Because they moved here to be close to the one grandchild whose parents work at A&M. So I am not an expert of the college policy or BCS demographics.

"Not the main point of the post, but the faculty spouse comment peaked my interest.

Gaming PCs and laptops and relatively good broadband have made LAN centers largely an anachronism.

If you’re determined to try it I would investigate and research LAN centers that are in fact working as a business preferably for years.  I’m sure they’re out there but you’re facing a long slog to make it viable.  

The basic goal of any business is to have it generate revenue and provide meaningful profit.  If it can’t do that within approximately 2 years - and thus you would need enough operating capital to keep it going that long - you might have a shot.

"But where would you put this bus lane? On Texas? University? What about the people that don’t live in the vicinity? Most of the area around Texas/University are apartments, rental homes rented by students. You are missing the neighborhoods of actual residents because most of them have moved further out to get away from the students. Are they expected to drive to a parking lot and walk to the bus stop? That defeats the purpose. Who is going to pay if the business owner tows the car while parking. This is huge in College Station with businesses wanting spots for patrons, not just random parkers. If they have to drive, they can just drive to the location. Adding buses increases costs and I don’t see those costs being justified in this area. The reason I only rode the bus a few times when I went to TAMU is because by the time I walked, waited and got to campus, it was usually about an hour. Couple that with needing to get to home and to work after classes, I didn’t have time to wait on a bus. Have you ever had to cart kids around and wait on buses? I have in other cities, kids aren’t patient. Remember when NG parking was FREE!?! I use to park up there after work, ride my bike to Mays and then ride it to the main campus. Can’t park there for free anymore. Miss the bus and you are late, might get yourself a $30 parking ticket. Pay enough of those fines, you might as well just buy a parking pass.",t2_3c9tharr,scratchoffqueen,0,1646509806.0,0,t1_hzhldia,hzhldia,False,TrejoAdrian,t3_t6mxdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeStation/comments/t6mxdw/college_station_should_have_dedicated_bus_lanes/,College Station should have dedicated bus lanes,/r/CollegeStation/comments/t6mxdw/college_station_should_have_dedicated_bus_lanes/hzhldia/,2,r/CollegeStation,0,2
"Those are neighborhoods, sure you can walk in neighborhoods, I’ve walked many I use to run south wood valley, edelweiss, Marion Pugh/sw parkway but you aren’t walking those areas for shopping. I don’t know how long you’ve been here but I walked from Walden Pond to Polo Club cause my car was left there from a party. I think it took me almost 2 hours walking. But we are not talking about walking in a neighborhood. Do you know how long it would take me to walk from Arrington to Texas? Or from where my house is to the HEB at Tower point or Jones Crossing. No sidewalks in certain areas. North gate is the old downtown and it’s probably the most walkable other than downtown Bryan but you are limited in businesses within the area. Take me to north gate but all I can do there is go to a bar and get lunch. It’s not like I can spend my day shopping and come home. Id have to catch a bus after bus after bus to get my errands run. 

Walking to Texas isn’t feasible for many people here, the city is sprawled. The transit authority has buses and you can schedule rides. TAMU has its bus system but it doesn’t go everywhere, it costs too much. The TAMU bus routes have barely changed in 20 years. You know why? Because it’s not a money maker. One bus is over $250K (remember the times when TAMU used to advertise this?) plus maintenance, gas, etc. I don’t know what the transportation fee is these days for students but when I worked on campus, I paid almost $400 for a non-guaranteed parking spot a year. Forget to put your tag on? Fine. Park in the wrong lot? They’ll tow you and fine. That’s where the money comes from. The cities have to rotate projects for funding, I won’t go into the city making terrible decisions on land purchases then selling at a loss, or the ARTS. But the city doesn’t have the funding for this, as I said in another post, it would be a huge undertaking and I don’t think there would be much interest except on gamedays.",t2_3c9tharr,scratchoffqueen,0,1646508985.0,0,t1_hzhjjhx,hzhjjhx,False,TrejoAdrian,t3_t6mxdw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeStation/comments/t6mxdw/college_station_should_have_dedicated_bus_lanes/,College Station should have dedicated bus lanes,/r/CollegeStation/comments/t6mxdw/college_station_should_have_dedicated_bus_lanes/hzhjjhx/,1,r/CollegeStation,0,1
"There are actually quite a few walkable neighborhoods here especially considering our size (CS: north gate, parkway square, lemon tree, bee creek, autumn chase, NE southwood valley, southwood terrace) (Bryan: southview terrace, parkway terrace, downtown, I’m not as familiar w Brian there may be more). A big problem is many of these walkable pockets are separated by big parking lots and R1 zoning, a better transit system that connected them well would see more rider ship than you’d expect even if you & the people you know would not care to use it.

Also since our city is long in one direction, short in the other, and pretty heavily clustered around Texas avenue a lot of people can walk from their home to tx ave and from tx ave to their desired destination making it honestly a prefect candidate for BRT (dedicated bus lanes).

Instead of adding another lane it would be much cheaper to just paint over an existing lane. Many people think that adding more lanes reduces traffic but surprisingly that isn't the case. Making other forms of transportation viable is the only way to reduce traffic congestion. So by making a dedicated bus lane more people would be encouraged to ride the bus. More people on the bus means less people in cars which means less traffic.

"Honestly I was bored and this gave me something to do. I already did this a few days ago playing around.

Our water likely would be okay and not contaminated (I think the water source is far from any targets.) Food and electricity would be the only real risks. Texas actually has its own grid for electricity, so someone would need to specifically target certain areas of Texas for there to be an issue.

Maybe foreign threats wouldn't target DC or LA because they see how much damage they do to our country anyway :p (jokes aside, those would probably be the prime targets)",t2_gzop9,TPMJB,0,1646153902.0,0,t1_hyxjkcl,hyxjkcl,False,Mag1cWays,t3_t3smao,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeStation/comments/t3smao/fallout_shelter_in_close_to_college_station/,Fallout shelter in close to college station?,/r/CollegeStation/comments/t3smao/fallout_shelter_in_close_to_college_station/hyxjkcl/,3,r/CollegeStation,0,3

"Alright, instead of just dismissing your fears, OP, I'll provide information on just why your fears are irrational.

So say Russia AND China have had enough of our shit and just launch nukes willy nilly. This is the US map - where would be a good target for the most damage to the US?

https://empoweryourknowledgeandhappytrivia.files.wordpress.com/2014/11/united_states.jpg

Coastal cities, cities with high population. But say for some reason they want to target Texas specifically. They hate our cows. Whatever. Big cities where a lot of damage could occur? Houston, Dallas. San Antonio and Austin are BIG maybe's. Why would anyone target a shit city with only 200k people (ours)? This is a good source for how this will affect you:

https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/

Really we could only possibly be affected if Austin or San Antonio was targeted specifically with the largest nuke on record, and even then the fallout is small (i.e your risks of cancer are pretty small). The possibility of Tsar Bomba actually making it to Austin or San Antonio, with the already slim possibilities they would ever be targeted, are infinitesimally small.

No, instead of Fallout shelters you should focus on the possibility of food/water/electrical issues.

I'm at a loss on what to do because it's like they have to be around here somewhere but as one person I can't search everywhere at once. I thought maybe somehow I could figure out the dude's number or if he had a facebook but I'm at a loss on where to even begin. I didn't realize there was so many Texas area code numbers and so many combinations. I'm actually no longer in state so this makes it even worse. I feel terrible I moved without her but we were moving and I couldn't do anything. I posted flyers in some areas before I left, including my own area but someone took it down right after I put it up. I have no idea why because our area has a community board and I even asked people where to post it and people told me to put it on the community board but I guess they didn't want it up there. The only other place I put flyers was at different Tracker Supplies cause I didn't know where to put them since you can't just hang them on poles. I was hoping people in different nearby towns could help with flyers or something to get these people to see it but I don't know anyone that well in the area and I no longer talk to the neighbor there. I thought about maybe I could make post cards with her picture and send them to various addresses but there's so many different areas and addresses I don't know where to even begin or how to find a list.",t2_k1rcjrv8,MissKitty_TX,0,1645797456.0,0,t1_hydpexq,hydpexq,False,MissKitty_TX,t3_t0spva,https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeStation/comments/t0spva/stolen_tabby_cat_please_help_share/,STOLEN TABBY CAT!

"Our cat was stolen and I've had a hard time locating her. I've posted her on every lost pet site I knew of, posted in Facebook groups, and no luck. I was wanting to try to reverse number search them but I don't know their name or number. I thought I could guess but there's wayy too many to guess from. I just want her back home I am devasted she has been gone this long. ANYTHING helpful I would greatly appreciate. I know these people live somewhere around here. If you're anywhere nearby this area please help keep a lookout and share as much as you can, other sites/apps, in public, ect, I just want my cat home :(

College Station is close to us and there is no group here for my community/town here so thought I'd post here. She was stolen and we are not sure where exactly they live so they may be in College Station area.  
  
Original post- PLEASE, can anyone HELP with locating the thieves? Is there a way we could mass search phone numbers or profiles to locate these people?! If anyone in an area around or in Bedias could share her flyers at a public place I would greatly appreciate it as owner is not currently in the state! The thieves commented being about 40 minutes from Bedias, they have ""yard"" dogs, and it was an older woman with a young man who called her ""maw/ma""! We aren't sure where they live but we just want this cat home! With enough sharing and posting we've got to find these people eventually!

"I live in Austin but was in BCS for 6 years. I’m gonna drop some deep cut restaurants for you. 

For street tacos my go to is Tacos La Perlita off Harvey Rd, *get the carnitas*. There’s also a Korean place across the street called Mong Chon Grill, Taste of Korea that’s freaking amazing. The best Torta Al Pastor imo is from the white food truck at The Backyard on Northgate! So-Fly Hot Chicken is a drive-thru off Texas Ave that has a badass chicken sandwich. For comforting Chinese food I always went to Chef Cao’s off University Dr. Best BBQ joint is 1775 Texas Pit BBQ and it’s not even close. If you’re looking for nice cocktails hit up Downtown Elixir’s in Downtown Bryan. If you’re looking for cheap cocktails then Rough Draught on Northgate. While you’re on NG get a breakfast shot at Dudley’s Draw (thank me later). Kyle House is my favorite coffee shop. Campfire is a cool farm to table restaurant with a great chef, located in the Stella Hotel. 

BCS is very comfortable and homey. I wish the music/art scene thrived more but at the end of the day it’s a college town centered around a military school so it’s pretty dry as far as creativity goes.

"There's nothing to worry about, I came all the way from Madrid, Spain...

It'll be a great experience, you'll meet people, you'll fall in love with the people, enjoy the food, you'll make connections, and grow.

This town is not that small, the sport scene is huge here, there's a lot of things you'll be missing, but you're 1-1.5 hours away from big cities like Houston and Austin for your favourite artist concert or big event.

There is also a weekly, seasonal event called the local where a bunch of shops, live music and stuff pop up. I went when it first started and once last year and it has grown massively.

"If you like coffee shops, I recommend [The Kyle House](https://www.downtownbryan.com/the-kyle-house) near downtown Bryan. It's an old house that has been turned into a coffee shop. Perfect place to study on a beautiful day as they have outdoor seating on their porch and lawn.

[Harvest](https://www.harvestbcs.com/) is another good one, also in downtown Bryan although they just opened up a  satellite location right across the street from A&M. (I haven't been to that location yet, so I can't speak towards it)

Sweet Eugene's is a good coffee place in College Station. It's large and eclectic, with funky art and mismatched comfy couches. It's a very popular location though, so it might be hard to find a table around midterms/finals.

If you're looking for non-country concerts, I recommend [The Stafford](https://grandstaffordtheater.com/) in downtown Bryan. You won't have concerts every week, but it's where you will more likely find non-country performers. 

As for events and happenings in the Bryan/College Station area, I recommend keeping an eye on [this page](https://visit.cstx.gov/events/?view=grid&sort=date) for college station events and [this page](https://www.destinationbryan.com/events/) for Bryan events. You can find events happening in the area, like athletics events at A&M, concerts, local trivia nights, yoga, community theater, etc. 


I've lived here for 10 years now and I think it's a great place to be. Coming from Houston, I've always said it has the feel of a small town but the amenities of a large city thanks to the university. Welcome and good luck with your studies!

Edit: One more thing. I encourage you to go to Hurricane Harry's (popular Country dance hall) at least once. It's a quintessential Aggie thing to do and it's free on Saturdays to those over 21.

"I'm from Houston, the 4th largest city in America, and I've lived here since 2016. It's very homy and there are plenty of good places to eat and cool bars. Downtown Bryan is dreamy and what American towns should be. College Station is a bit larger and has some more modern things. Bryan has First Friday on the first of the month, which you can kind of think of is a town festival where there are bands playing outside, all of the shops are open, people are drinking and having a good time. There rodeo comes to Reed Arena once a year and we have concerts here in town some parts of the year. There's a ton of churches and we do actually have a good number of nice parks in College Station, and golf courses in College Station and Bryan. I welcome you to Texas and I hope you have a great time here. My only note to you would be that you shouldn't come here looking for a unique experience every 20 seconds. I think a lot of urban Americans have this problem where they want to visit a different museum every Saturday or be able to visit a different bar or comedy joint every time they go out... I think that's just people being too lazy to have actual unique experiences with other people. At least, that's how I was in Houston.

Still, Wastewater cost is roughly double what water costs me, which is bs.

>They keep the power and water on very, very consistently.

I've lived in many places and never heard of water ever going out (10+ across the US). Electricity last year, most of Bryan and college station were out for a week. I was at a different house in Bryan and on the hospital grid, but down the street had no power. Doesn't sound like the flawless record you propose.

"This is not accurate information, at least for the US. Ivermectin hasn't been FDA approved for treating COVID-19, which only means that Merck can't advertise it as such. Doctors can prescribe whatever off-label meds they want. Hospitals may have policies barring doctors from certain prescriptions, but that is it. There are plenty of US doctors who have prescribed Ivermectin for COVID-19 prevention and/or treatment, and who continue to do so. Also New Hampshire is about to make it legal to sell over-the-counter.

**Edit:** After re-reading I saw you mentioned the licensing boards.

Well then maybe the signal is weak from the router. You ever check connection strength on your connected devices? I get a shitty signal in my office (and it's the only room in the house that does) and I use a mesh system plugged into my router to make up for that.

You have a decent router, but it's a budget router so it may not be sufficient depending on your home size. You can spend...lots on routers.

"FYI as an update so far Rx Pizza is the best I've tried of all those recommended (though admittedly I haven't tried all suggestions yet).  

Piasano's was still meh IMO.  Not terrible, but not particularly great either.  I would say it's a good value for the money - a TON of pizza.  Lots of lots and LOTS of cheese for sure.  My kids ate on the pie I got for days.

"I used Take5 on Southwest parkway and recommend them also. They required new windshield wipers (which I knew I should have replaced for the month or two, but hadn't). I just had them put on new windshield wipers, which I am sure cost more than if I had done it myself but that is fine.

They also spotted a rear turn signal out. They actually took a look at it and were able to just get it to work again (probably was just a loose connection).

The process was easy, you could just stay in the car.  And they didn't have a problem with ""insurance card"" just on my phone (in the past I had a place that wouldn't accept it and I had to have my agent fax them a copy).

"I worked at Welborn Road for 5 years. I have worked in other states and clinics but unfortunately CStat was always rampant with Parvo it seemed. Please get those first sets of puppy and kitten shots, they are extremely important to your pets long term well being. Parvo can and is usually deadly in young pups without quick treatment and very expensive to treat at that.  Parvo can also live in the environment, like your apartment complex grounds for many years. That's why we stress young pups and cats shouldn't be allowed outside to roam or meet unvaccinated adult dogs/cats until they have had their boosters. I've got more experience with Parvo puppies than I would ever like to have. It SUCKS.

"> A prosecutor won't file a criminal case for hurting someone's feelings.

It's the same bullshit ""BrazosReporter"" has been complaining about for the last year. David Flash doesn't have any talent as a reporter, so he shits up this sub with his highschool-newsletter-quality complaints every month. All because one of the useless reporters in ""Brazos Guardian"" complained to Dustin about getting ""illegal haircuts"".

But after several people complained about BrazosReporter, whoever was in control of that profile cut the shit for a few months and we were in relative peace. Instead of complaining about how Dustin hurt their feelings, they posted a write-up about some stupid taco truck or something that was coming to CStat, trying to build up their karma. And now it's obvious that person is back on his/her bullshit again.

College Station only exists to serve the University and the CS city council. 

The property taxes are much higher than Bryan if you are going to buy a house. 

The city is removing recreational things like pools and parks. They are giving away millions to have new big businesses move in. 

It used to be worth it to stay here for the school system (which is still excellent) but now Bryan ISD is ranked as high or higher in many areas as CSISD. 

So I’m a bit bitter about owning in CS, but we stayed long enough for both our kids to graduate from CSISD and now our house is close enough to being paid off that we are going to stay.

"VIP Enterprises

They are a tree trimming company that sells firewood. When you call they will give you the # to the firewood guy (sorry not in my contacts).

Last year's freeze depleted stock and people have been buying early. I would expect prices to be a bit higher and wood to be a tad greener purchasing this late in the year.

They will deliver & stack too.
