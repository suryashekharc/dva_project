I yield as one group of people cross and check the corner to see if the other people were going to cross and they weren’t and just stranding there, so I began my turn, but as soon as I started turning they began to cross quickly to catch up to the group of people in the front, so I stopped to let them cross but by that time oncoming traffic was already approaching the intersection and had to wait for me for pedestrians to cross.

And I'd argue both of your problems with Downtown would be solved with a complete street. With more people coming it would be easy to see what needs to go as certain shops would simply see no change or negative changes to their business while great places would adapt and grow.

"I agree with almost everything you've said here. 

That being said, I think it's not all that great among valley cities. I feel Exeter and Hanford have comparable, if not superior downtown experiences. 

Some other issues will need to be resolved:

1) Improving Visalia's food culture. This city has been called very ""chain loyal"" by analysts who are involved in the process of deciding which restaurants will do well here. We need a better local food scene. Our downtown Mexican restaurants are overpriced garbage, many of our restaurants have horrendous lighting (looking at you, Sequoia and Stacked), and many other places are only open for lunch. Even the ""nice"" places are not only not as good as what they have in Fresno (Elderwood), they're trying to charge the same prices for inferior experiences or are firmly stuck in the 80s (Vintage Press, the Depot, Tommy's). Hell, I don't even go to Pita Kabob because the owner has literally done illegal things to ""dox"" patrons who left negative reviews after literally being yelled at by the owner in the restaurant. 

We do have good places, and good talent - but we need more if downtown is really going to come to life. I'd love it if the people behind Quesadilla Gorilla/Component tackle this someday. They know their shit. 

2) Better shopping. I don't know if this can be fixed in the internet age. Downtown isn't setup for the volume that great places to shop demand. Small, speciality places work, but come on - we don't need a dozen dress shops downtown. We need speciality bakeries, interesting boutiques that aren't dated as hell, perhaps a used outdoor gear shop, etc. After this next recession, I hope this improves.",t2_j7rehk6p,MetaphysicalBlue,0,1648653048.0,0,t1_i2q2758,i2q2758,True,Sequoiadendron_1901,t3_trz3lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/trz3lt/a_more_complete_main_street/,A More Complete Main Street,/r/visalia/comments/trz3lt/a_more_complete_main_street/i2q2758/,2,r/visalia,0,2

"I certainly agree with your opinion on prices staying moderate but Visalia is not immune to the rate hikes. Mortgage lending still comprises the bulk of all home purchases in CA and Visalia specifically, if those dry up the competition of cash buyers can't sustain these prices alone.

I would dare to say that even in the past week I am looking at large number of price reductions on current listings, much more than in previous weeks. Combine this with the uptick in homes hitting the market in the spring and we could see a substantial shift for buyers.

It's hard to believe that this can have a long term impact as the number of buyers is still currently outpacing the amount of homes for sale.

"In my opinion:

Rates will still be historically low. They won't impact all cash buyers (read: corporations, investors) people moving from other parts of California

In Visalia, the prices probably won’t fall because of how low they are compared to nearby communities. I'm well aware of the incoming rate hikes. I just don’t see the listing prices falling much, if at all - 15% year over year? No way, but a year from now if they’re 3-5% higher, I wouldn’t be surprised. Now, actual closing price may fall due to fewer people fighting over homes, but who knows if that will actually be the case. 

Story will be different in other parts of California, possibly. 

Where's the new inventory going to come from? Foreclosures, if an oncoming recession is bad enough, but the people looking to buy will still be competing with cash only buyers who see (rightfully so) real estate as a safe bet when other investments are hitting the shitter.

I'd love to be wrong, but inventory here is still abysmally low.

">The “positive” things are just people in denial. It isn’t true. I’ve lived all over the place and I can tell you that this place is awful.

I think the issue arises when you post things like what I've quoted above. This is not just an opinion, but an assertion of fact. 

&#x200B;

People get upset when you tell them they live in ""shitholes""; which they are entitled to feel . They live here and identify with the community and as such your statements are insulting. 

 Yes, compared to metropolitan life there is considerably less amenities here. That does not equate to ""no amenities"" as you also asserted.  Objectively, there are amenities that exist in Visalia, though you may not find them of value. There is excellent access to hiking and other outdoor recreation, AND there is a lack of nightlife and arts (my views). 

From you perspective as a single woman, I can see your point that there is a lack of things in which you might find interest. However, I think OP and everyone here would find it more helpful and less offensive if you just listed the things you found to be lacking rather than call the town a ""boring"" ""shithole.""

Seem to be a lot of haters here. I would start by going downtown Main Street. Last couple years Visalia Main Street has been popping. But I would also take a drive down on Mooney Boulevard. When you get established you can frequent the Tulare Outlets. Also Kaweah Lake and Three Rivers is great for fishing camping Etc. Visalia is a great place.

"This last year was the first time in over a decade we had traditional Tule Fog. The atmospheric conditions rarely exist any more due to either lack of moisture (hello drought) or wind (stirs the inversion layers). Climate change has ironically made things far less dangerous. That said, it is NOT just morning fog, and it is difficult to describe how the lack of visibility changes things. 

This is an insightful article from someone who moved to the Central Valley: [https://www.latimes.com/projects/return-tule-fog-california-central-valley/](https://www.latimes.com/projects/return-tule-fog-california-central-valley/)

I recall going to a family Christmas party in Strathmore back in the late '80's - just North of Porterville - an old orange growers ranch. When you don't visit a place in the country but maybe every other year, you might have to get out of the car and look at street signs in the dark and fog! My sister and I were both back from school, so we had a mutual support laugh about it, but there are no style points for being brave in dense fog.

SO - yes, the fog can be indescribably dense, no I don't like my wife commuting to Hanford in it, NO it is not common any longer and Visalia has a very good quality of life that I definitely prefer to Porterville. 

Incidental to all this, at the beginning of pandemic I had to turn up a different kind of VPN with more tolerance for latency due to the really crappy home cable internet connections for staff living in Porterville. They have some bough-five-times-since-Falcon connectivity there, seems to be Spectrum now. Blech. Frontier is the telco provider, double yuck! 

Comcast residential can be a nightmare to deal with, but the performance and cost in Visalia is darn good (Xfinity). The old Visalia neighborhoods with above-ground power/phone lines (you'll see the poles) are getting AT&T fiber at an astounding rate, 1 mile per day according to the AT&T tech I chatted with in our neighborhood. My cousin has their service a few blocks from us, symmetrical 1 Gbit is $80-ish a month (!!!). Unfortunately getting past the AT&T GPON terminal to run your own router and such is excessively difficult, so I run my own equipment on Xfinity.

"This still baffles me and I've lived here in Visalia since 2013 (believe me, qthe years flew by!) Coming from my hometown inside Los Angeles County (and a brief 5 years in beautiful San Diego 😍), I am generally familiar with how crime on the streets works over there. With that being said, crime was usually dedicated to a majority 
of one crappy town and everyone knew which areas to attempt to avoid.  Over here on the other hand, you have a brief warning that you are on your way into a bad neighborhood by catching the decline in aesthetics of the nearby stores.  With all that said,  I wasted your time since I still have no answer to your question. It's really quite scary that a handful of streets in Visalia can produce so much crime and hurt.

Little 2/1 houses that 2 years ago would have been $150k are now selling for $300k. This is a very crazy time for real estate in Visalia and everywhere else too.

The floors were put in so bad that I couldn’t use my vacuum on them because the vacuum wouldn’t roll over the tiles- the height difference was that bad all over the house. Every single room with tile. 
They replaced the worst parts but wouldn’t replace the whole floor. 
Other issues to get repaired took months - they’d make an appointment and then we would take the day off work and no one would show up. 
Poor quality control- they never hooked up the wires to the sprinklers so our lawn was dying. Turned out the wires inside the wall were never connected. We had stuff like that pop up constantly. The new owners are lucky because we fixed everything thinking we were staying. 
If you go with DR Horton, make them fix everything before you move in. I would even go as far as hiring my own home inspector to catch issues. Honestly I would do that with lennar too - make them fix any issues before you sign off on it and move in",t2_3zhy09hy,Mako-the-Landshark,0,1647103227.0,0,t1_i0dv1uc,i0dv1uc,False,Ordinary-Sand-1450,t3_t001xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/t001xx/is_visalia_dangerous/,Is Visalia dangerous?,/r/visalia/comments/t001xx/is_visalia_dangerous/i0dv1uc/,2,r/visalia,0,2

"The problem with abandoned and eerie places is Visalia is not a city in decline. It's constantly growing and knocking down the old to build the new. You might have to go out into the hills and do a little trespassing to find anything really fitting your tastes. There's a lot of abandoned buildings out in the fields but most are on private property. 

My recommendation is to head out into the Yokohl Valley or north on Exeter Blvd. There's some empty buildings where old telephone lines and a railroad used to run. The Valley doesn't have as much old infrastructure but it's got a lot of caves with Native paintings and some abandoned buildings.

"We were going to move from the house we were in to that same lennar new construction. I’m sure you saw in the disclosures about the homeless shelter and the low income housing. It’s going in right on the other side of the wall from those. The houses are pretty but we worried we wouldn’t be able to sell later for the amount we were buying the house for. We had signed and put our deposit down, then a few months later the shelter and apartment project was announced. We asked (and so did most other buyers) about making the neighborhood  gated but lennar said no.  

Another issue for us was that they kept delaying. The house we were supposed to buy was  supposed to be finished nov 12, then they said end of nov. Then Jan, then feb.  I drove by the other day and it’s not to done yet. 

We had sold our house and the buyers were letting us lease it back until the new construction was done, but they finally said no more extensions so we had to move out. There was nothing to rent short term. 
I know that’s not their fault but it was a problem for us. 


The car being lit on fire and the shooting at the park happened after we signed. Then they announced the shelter and apartments, and we were asked to sign new disclosures or if we wanted out they’d refund our deposit, so we started looking for another house. 

I would say don’t buy over there if u can avoid it, new construction or not. 
There’s San Joaquin homes on riggin and Akers, or southern highlands on visalia parkway and demaree if you want new construction. 

Don’t get me wrong, those houses are gorgeous- I was bummed at the location, and the park problems increasing. Riverway park is across a busy street from the houses. But the riverbed is along the outside of the housing tract and there’s a significant homeless problem here now. They’ll be around those houses too So I would anticipate some problems. 

And visalia is nice enough. I just didn’t think it was a wise investment to buy over there.

A fun place to chill is to drive to this place called rocky hill ( 36.29668° N, 119.09841° W ) it has a nice view at night and a lot of people go running on this road be a little careful there at night It’s pretty dark",t2_3f8nl6mj,TacticZoom,0,1645688822.0,0,t1_hy7q9ps,hy7q9ps,False,Ordinary-Sand-1450,t3_t001xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/t001xx/is_visalia_dangerous/,Is Visalia dangerous?,/r/visalia/comments/t001xx/is_visalia_dangerous/hy7q9ps/,3,r/visalia,0,3

Visalia is pretty safe just stay away from the oval area lots of homeless Mooney is a nice place it’s the center of Visalia it has the very small Visalia mall compared to Roseville which I have been to many times since family lives there honestly Main Street is super nice one of the best in the valley just be careful driving there lots of one way roads. The north side of Visalia is pretty nice just stay away from Huston around a gas station called double d mini market. It’s super getto I only go to Huston to get Scotty donuts other than that never really walk there. The east side area around lovers lane is not the best place to walk so stick to demaree and county center they are pretty safe. There is also a cross road called ferguson and dinuba not the safest place tones of homeless just I only drive by there to go to target also don’t even stop at a store called shop and go gas station not worth it just go to the arco.,t2_3f8nl6mj,TacticZoom,0,1645688407.0,0,t1_hy7pmrc,hy7pmrc,True,Ordinary-Sand-1450,t3_t001xx,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/t001xx/is_visalia_dangerous/,Is Visalia dangerous?,/r/visalia/comments/t001xx/is_visalia_dangerous/hy7pmrc/,5,r/visalia,0,5

"We lived in orchard walk by the target. My house was in dove near riggin st and court st . The house was nice, the yard huge! But the area is sketchy.

They dump the trash cans to look through them, etc. and there was a shooting 2 streets down from our house (we lived on dove). When we bought our house it was new, and most of the rest of the  houses weren’t built yet. I didn’t know how close we were to the bad areas.

The target is ok, but you should know they are building low income housing and a homeless shelter in the field between the lennar houses which are north and behind target and the DR Horton houses that are right behind the target.

"There are actually a few precedents around the country for light rail lines considerably longer than the distance from Visalia to Hanford! Granted, most of them are within pretty continuously built-up areas, but I'd cite the River Line in New Jersey as an exception—its route from Trenton to Camden is over thirty miles, with several large gaps between stops.

Additionally, interurban-style service—operating like light rail in city centers and like regional rail in more rural areas—used to be common across the US and died out largely due to the automobile lobby, as seen with the Pacific Electric in Los Angeles! This sort of service is still decently common in Europe to this day; I'd cite the Sheffield Supertram and the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn as good examples.

As for the case of Visalia and Hanford specifically, one big advantage of making that connection is because of the planned HSR station, which is much closer to Hanford than to Visalia. It makes total sense to connect the light rail system to the station, making the light rail an excellent solution for the last-mile problem. And if you're going all the way out to the station, might as well go to Hanford too; it's right there!

I'd say you're spot-on about the issues surrounding going east to the park, though.",t2_5zur73x2,thetransitgirl,0,1645063074.0,0,t1_hx96jzn,hx96jzn,False,sikhlakersfan,t3_lea4de,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/lea4de/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_visalia_light_rail/,What do you guys think of the Visalia light rail map I made,/r/visalia/comments/lea4de/what_do_you_guys_think_of_the_visalia_light_rail/hx96jzn/,2,r/visalia,0,2

You make a compelling argument.  I read every word of it.  I have lived in Tulare County for 40 or so years of my 45.  There was a horrible flood in 1955 or there about.  My grand mother told me there was 6 feet deep water on main street in Visalia.  The areas that Mr. Fyffe's car thief was spotted in are extremely rural  mountain communities.  The jacket found in Lodge Pole is not in police evidence?  It would have been Park Rangers at Lodge Pole and Dorst's Creek.  Lodge Pole is a trail head to the John Muir Trail of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.  People rent pack mules in lodge pole and hike 30 miles up Mt. Whitney.  It is back country and that is where the trail went cold on the suspect.  Kingsburg is the closest city to Traver.  Kingsburg startles Fresno and Tulare county.  I don't think you mentioned Kingsburg.  Maybe try searching records there?  Great read very interesting.

"I like Neighborhood Church. They have a “FOR Visalia” campaign that really focuses on helping the community rather than being “against” things. They focus on a specific group to help every month (one month they asked people to bring diapers and wipes for single moms, for example) and they partner with a lot of non-profits in the city to support their work, including some homeless outreach services. They partner with a local school that has primarily low-income families and provide mentorship and even college scholarships for the kids, and at Christmas they have toys for their parents to buy at 90% off.

Your not wrong. But just because some people can afford $1400 a month for rent not everyone can. There should be multiple price points for the renting market but as you said….. greed.

Why charge 400-800 when the owner can charge twice that and get it. I lived in a place for 15 yrs with rent at 600 a month.

Agree. I’d love too find my own place but I can only afford $600 a month for rent. There’s nowhere in California that lists studios that cheap.

"Depends what you’re looking for.

If you drink and need some buddies, try some of the breweries in and around town. Always a friendly crowd there. Barrelhouse has games I believe.

If you wanna hoop, hit up some parks with a half or full court around town.

Take a class or two at COS. You don’t have to do anything too curricular either. Maybe some classes like cooking or dancing.

If you skate or rollerblade, Provident skate park. Very upbeat and mostly chill crowd.

If all else fails, go on Facebook and the meetup app. They have groups you can get together with and do extracurricular activities like hiking, running, or even trivia nights sometimes.

This is your best bet at staying at a decent hotel/motel for a reasonable price.  Going rates here are from $80 to $120 per night (per Hotwire and Priceline).

If you will not have a car, find something near groceries or be willing to pay a little more for Instacart/DoorDash/GrubHub to have things delivered to you.

Visalia has the best downtown in the valley. The sky will be clear soon so park on top of the parking structure on Acequia and look over the hills and downtown before walking to a restaurant on or just off Main. There's a lot of clothing and jewelry shops as well as a record shop on Main. Some have already suggested the Hotel restaurant but there's also good Mexican BBQ and Mediterranean downtown too. Then you could get hot chocolate at Starbucks and sit in the cold together looking at the lights. Idk if covid has changed this but there's usually an ice skating rink by the Regal and lights/decorations all over downtown.

"Actually if you look at a map it purposely cuts Visalia, a reddish-purple city, in half separating both republican voters and the second largest African American population in Central California into 2 districts.

I respectfully disagree. The district is shaped in a way to capture predominantly white neighborhoods and stretches down the 99 to Visalia lumping in farmers who traditionally are republicans. The district line specifically skips over areas that are more diverse e.g tower district.

"Actually thanks to the City of Fresno Nunes' district is a more blue-purple than you'd think. While all the city's except Fresno have turned more red Fresno grows the fastest and usually with Bay Area Refugees who haven't learned their lesson about bad politics yet. So a democrat does stand a chance at winning as long as at least 2 other towns vote blue with Fresno or at least an equal populations worth. 

It's actually a weird situation because many groups think Fresno should go with the more blue Stanislaus-Fresno district so it could have more representation without drowning Republican votes while some democrats would prefer the gamble of possibly taking Nunes' seat. 

There's also the racial question as removing Fresno from that district decreases the Latino population (and thus representation) but keeping it dilutes the African American population (representation) in the Tulare-Kings-Kern area due to CA redistricting rules.",t2_d4wx2un9,Sequoiadendron_1901,0,1638958306.0,0,t1_hnp9xgz,hnp9xgz,False,BlankVerse,t3_rb6wlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/visalia/comments/rb6wlq/devin_nunes_retirement_could_mean_an_opening_for/,Devin Nunes’ retirement could mean an opening for California Democrats.

Get comfortable hanging out alone. Go see that movie by yourself and have a great time.

Alternatively, get involved outside of school in something else your interested in and meet new people.

"Ya see, you didn't listen at all.

Irrational psychopathic behaviour is what YOU feel is the answer to the question.  Before even considering the situation logically and with empathy your IMMEDIATE reaction is to dismiss the behavior.

Ill give an example using Trump supporters on Jan 6.  I don't think insurrectionists were (all) sociopaths, irrational sure, but I recognize (through empathy) that they feel helpless and angry, that their voices arent heard and they had no other choice but violence because they believe a big lie.  That they trust their friends and peers over objective, measurable evidence, which is why they believe the big lie.  It does not mean I support their decision, but understanding motive goes a long way when determining whether you support something or not.  Meanwhile, we are literally watching republicans dismantle democracy, gerrymander and suppress votes in a tangible, factual, well documented and easily proven way and its resulting in the despair of the other side who will feel powerless as Republicans easily win 2022, 2024 and beyond.  Both sides feel the same way, but only one side is grounded in reality.

All I was saying is there is no easy way to get into or out of Visalia and that is a very bad thing. As I said, when the train does not even stop there, that is a not a good sign.

"I was unwinding some investments in property for my company -- we had been involved in central valley real estate for many, many years.

One thing I noticed: on what used to be a street of upscale properties, there was one functioning streetlight -- almost pitch black at night. I walked around during the daytime and spoke to some locals who told me of car break-ins and squatters breaking into houses listed for sale. 

We no longer own property in Visalia and I think we might not have anything in the valley at all. 

But Visalia's proximity to the parks and the mountains as well as being not too far from San Francisco and the coast are all pluses.

"I’ve got one relayed and cannot figure it out. 

I’ve attempted to change settings to 44158, reboot router and miner, then I go to check it on port checker.co and it still says closed. 


  I was using portchecker.co earlier.    In my router settings I would use IP address ABC , which I found doing the diagnostic on the miner .    

When I would go to portchecker.co IP address XYZ automatically populates.  I run the test on both ABC and XYZ IP address and get the same closed results.
