>Benjamin Hromadka, 15, wants to change the narrative around young people always being on their phones.  
Hromadka is the owner and founder of Camas Typewriter Co., a one-man business focusing on restoring and selling vintage typewriters. While many may think typewriters are outdated, Hromadka hopes that the passion he brings to his work will inspire people to reconsider.

It can be a bit shocking to people to see a sophomore in high school working on typewriters older than his grandparents, but everyone here finds it cool,” Hromadka said. “Clark County has a lot of people interested in typewriters and antiques, so the market for typewriters here is a lot larger than most other parts of the United States.”

"Lacamas/Round Lake in town is great for a quick afternoon. Washougal also has a very small skills section in Hamllik Park. Stay away from both when it's been wet!

If it's dried out a bit and the snow has melted off the top, the Yacolt Burn area is fantastic. Trails are generally flowy with bits of techier sections here and there, plus there's the Thrillium DH/jump trail. The trailhead also serves the Bells Mountain XC trail, and nearby are some much longer loop trails that are shared with horse riders. Yacolt is about a 40 min drive from Camas, and requires a Discover Pass to park at the trailhead.

Sandy Ridge in Oregon on the way to Mt. Hood (about an hour from Camas) is also excellent, and seems to hold up better when trails are still a little damp. It has everything from very beginner trails to intermediate fast bermed/rollered flow trails to expert jump and technical trails. It does not require any parking passes.

Syncline is in Washington about 1 hr 15 min east of Camas. It's far rockier than the above trails and east enough to get much less rain, so it is better when the more local trails are too soggy. Beware of ticks and poison oak though. I can't remember if it needs a parking pass, but I don't think so.

Portland has a purpose-built MTB park at Gateway Green. It looks like they are doing work on the main jump lines there, but the beginner trails and the pump track should be open. Portland also has a privately-owned indoor park called The Lumberyard.

There are other nearby systems I haven't had the chance to explore yet, including Post Canyon in Hood River OR (\~75 min away), LL Stub Stewart west of Portland (\~60 min away), a very few trails open to bikes in Forest Park in Portland (\~45 min away), plus a bunch of parks in Portland, like Powel Butte, that look like they have decent biking trails.

"This is a really good observation and I'd echo that I think its common in Camas, particularly up the hill in the prune hill type neighborhoods. Many neighborhoods up there are quiet, focused on their job, kids activities / school and staying inside to scroll on Facebook / watch TV. A lot of living through kids at the house, and this seens to involve a decent bit of drinking. When people do get ""social"", alcohol may be seen as the crutch to help them become more ""social"" since its quite unusual for them to be hanging out with someone that isn't their kid, spouse or partner. 

My experience is that there isn't a lot of adults with hobbies outside of their kids and the ones that do are away most weekends. 

Compare this with other transplanty places such as Bend or Hood River and the social makeup / approach is very very different and more open.",t2_41pe511l,Fair_Bison8497,0,1646380888.0,0,t1_hzajwiu,hzajwiu,True,Kind_Camel7013,t3_t6ctvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/camaswashington/comments/t6ctvj/grownup_friendships_are_so_weird/,Grownup Friendships Are So Weird,/r/camaswashington/comments/t6ctvj/grownup_friendships_are_so_weird/hzajwiu/,3,r/camaswashington,0,3

">Preliminary land-use concepts for Camas’ North Shore show a mix of residential, commercial, mixed-use and business park-light industrial zones abutting a thick band of city-owned green space along the northern shores of Lacamas Lake.  
The city has been working with two subcommittees to develop draft land-use and transportation options for the North Shore, a 990-acre area that is currently being used for agricultural and single-family residences, but is expected to see substantial growth over the next 20 years.  
Camas annexed about 800 acres in the North Shore area into the city in 2010, with plans to use the mostly agricultural area for a mix of residential, commercial and industrial purposes.  
“North Shore is in the city limits and has comprehensive plan designation and zoning,” Camas Planning Manager Robert Maul said during a Parks and Recreation Commission meeting on Jan. 26. “It could move forward with development today if somebody wanted to do that.”  
Instead, city officials and many community members hope the North Shore will develop into a unique, forward-thinking area of Camas known for its abundance of green spaces and recreational opportunities; natural beauty and environmental protection; walkability; mix of housing options; small, locally owned businesses; and light industrial business parks located farther away from the lake, on the northern end of the North Shore.  
The city has two drafts — Option A and Option B — on the table for consideration. Both options have a variety of land uses and zoning, including business park/light industrial, commercial, mixed-use, higher-density residential, lower-density residential, parks/open spaces, and schools.  
Both options designate around 250 acres — or 25 percent of the space — for parks and open spaces, but Option A offers more lower-density residential (230 acres in Option A versus 199 acres in Option B), business park/light industrial land (187 acres in Option A versus 153 acres in Option B) and commercial areas (75 acres in Option A versus 49 acres in Option B). Option B offers more higher-density residential (175 acres) than Option A (132 acres).  
The draft options will serve as the starting point for new recommendations for zoning in the North Shore as well as new design and zoning standards.  
Camas officials are seeking more input from residents on the city’s North Shore Subarea Plan. The city launched an online virtual open house on the Engage Camas website on Feb. 16.

"We moved here a few months ago from outer SE Portland, and we have a 2 year old. I had always thought I'd live in Portland my whole life, but we had dealt with multiple incidents around our home that factored into us moving away (attempted break-in, woman high on meth screaming at us and blocking my son and I from leaving our house, police searching for a guy with a gun in our side yard, etc). 

The first night in our new place in Camas, I stepped outside to look at the moon and it felt like a weight had been taken off my shoulders. It was so quiet, and I felt safe for the first time in quite awhile. I didn't even realize how much the anxiety was weighing on me. We've been here for about 5 months now and I absolutely love it. It's a great place to have a young child. There are so many great parks and trails, our neighbors are wonderful, the downtown area is cute and we love the library.

"They wanted to prevent CRT and woke garbage in schools, and they wanted to stop mask mandates. Those two reasons are all I need to call someone a shithead. 

I use that term because the anger you express at ‘wokeness’ and how you immediately bring up BLM shows an intuitionism  with ethics and worldviews, one that is damaging not just to you but to children you demand learn the same way to think. Intuitionist logic pushes any direction it needs to as long as the person at the center has a reason to jump on consistencies from their perspective. 

It’s how you leap from my frustration at people yelling at school boards to BLM. They’re not related except to you and those who think like you.  BLM was an explicitly anti-police-overreach protest, it wasn’t about being woke. It was about how the police everywhere and government have rights to ruin us and trample our freedoms of just existing. 

When the police came in and beat and tear-gassed and even shot at protestors during BLM conservatives cheered them on, even if the protest was peaceful. 

Contrast this to the trucker protests in Canada where the government froze their accounts and the police trampled them with horses and more. Conservatives are furious, Laura southern even tweeted that maybe the police are overreaching. 

Most of us on the left? Really mad alongside conservatives, writing lawmakers even as I cannot believe anyone here in the US would be happy about that or even propose the ability for American leadership to do the same. 

That’s the difference.  I’m against government overreach. Conservatives care firdt about who’s the victim and build their moral system after that. Conservatives are the real identify politics people, naturally. After all, idpol has always been a reactionary philosophy. So yes.

"Camas is definitely top 3 places to live in Portland metro, and has made several lists in top places to live in WA State and even nationwide.

Basically great schools all around, no unsafe neighborhoods, very well funded public services, a LOT of parks and all of them very nice, and the Round Lake area is something that not even much larger cities have. Lots of trails, biking, lakes, close to wild areas, all the outdoors stuff you want.

Traffic can always be a problem in Portland Metro, but the 205 bridge and 205 in general is better than I-5. 14 only has traffic around rush hours.

Housing is on the expensive side, but when compared to Portland proper is not more expensive.

Anyone who says camas is balanced is probably center right on the spectrum. It’s a lovely place, the people are generally quite kind. But it is very conservative. 

The silver lining is more non-shitheads are moving here. And I’d encourage you to as well. It’s a place of decently active local politics and involved people. 

As an example, last year the camas school board had a whole slew of shitheads coming and screaming at them about masks and ‘woke’ things - the kind of thing you see on YouTube. To the cities credit, a good number of people didn’t let it sit like that and came out in support of the school board. So it’s changing. And the best way for it to change is more people.

I hope that this event causes the community to acknowledge that this is an issue and for the students to discuss and share their opinions and experiences.

"I have 3 kids, all either adults or nearly adults at this point.  They grew up in East Vancouver / Camas, and a period of time also in a suburb of Seattle that is as nearly bucolic as Camas.

During my time as a parent, I have found these communities generally not Racist as we think of it in the classic sense.  What I have found is these communities are very much Classist, and culturally exclusionary.

The Classist tendency/ Cultural Elitism is very inclusionary when you fit into the correct class/culture. 

Economically well off - not rich, comfortable - ensconced firmly in that middle to upper middle class, then regardless of race or religion, this community is welcoming.

The problem is when that traditional middle class culture clashes with cultures seen as 'less than'. This includes urban poor or rural poor.

I am the Benson High School head girls basketball coach of some of the most brillant, gifted, talented and inspirational Black and brown young ladies in the city of Portland and the Portland Public School District. I could write in perpetuity how truly amazing these young ladies are and what they not only mean to so many in our city, but to their community as well. These young ladies stand on the broad shoulders of hard working parents, aunties and uncles, grandparents and great grandparents, who generations ago endured the worst of bigotry, racism and oppression. They, like many of their Black and brown peers, are truly their ancestors' wildest dreams. Therefore, is with great pain and frustration that I write this letter to the Camas SD, Camas high school principal, faculty, athletic director, coaches and student body.  
>  
>This past Friday night, December 10, 2021, Benson girls basketball team played Camas High School at Camas. This was our girls' second game of the season and first road trip. They were naturally excited to play a very competitive game against a legendary program in SW Washington. Clearly Camas was as excited as we were based on the crowd's size and energy over the first home game of the season. During the JV game my varsity players, who sat next to the Camas student section, expressed to me that the student section had hurled racist slurs to and about my Benson players, specifically the ""N-word."" I took their words in and encouraged them to ignore them and allow our play to be the response to their racism. I assured them that I had their back and that unfortunately racism is a fact and reality for us, and that they will have to navigate this the rest of their lives.  
>  
>Throughout the game, both during play and timeouts, a number of my players told me one-on-one that they were hearing individuaals from the student section using the N-word to taunt our players. Additionally, Benson parents came to me and said that they heard people in the Camas student section using very derogatory language about our players and felt it created a very hostile environment. By the second half, I had heard the same thing from enough players that I finally had to take action, so I waked right on to the court at the next dead ball toward the student section saying ""we are not going to do this anymore."" The referees intercepted me and I alerted them to what I had been hearing from my players and that I would not tolerate the blatant racist language directed toward our girls, and if the referees did not get it under control we would not finish the game. The referees assured me that they would not tolerate that kind of bevor either. I then huddled with my girls, and we agreed to play through the hostity. We won the game by eight points. The Camas players were great; none of my players or parents heard or felt anything hostile or racial from them; it appeared to be limited to the student section in the stands.

>Please consider this an official complaint. I am writing to you as a Black father, husband, public school coach, community and nonprofit leader. I am as familiar as you are with athletic codes of conduct at state and national levels, as well as pertinent laws and regulations, and our political climate. I would never purport to educate you or make assumptions about your implementation of these things. Based on my team's experience in your gym Friday night, clearly you have a lot more work to do around fundamental principles of diversity, equity and inclusion. My team is solely comprised of young women of color; they deserve to be treated with respect and feel safe no matter what gym they play in. The core of this complaint is a question: What are you going to do to ensure that Camas High School will be a safe environment for the neat team of non-white students that plays in your gym? I leave this question for all of you to grapple with and I trust that you will do so.

">Dear Camas Community,  
Our school board received a complaint on Monday, December 13, that has since been shared on social media. The complaint alleged that racist remarks were made from our student spectator section during a Benson High vs. Camas High basketball game. The same day, we launched an investigation led by a neutral third party and consulted with the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA). On Tuesday, December 14, and throughout the week leading up to winter break, interviews were conducted with student spectators, student athletes, and staff present at the game. Interviews with Benson High students and staff are expected to begin this week and interviews will continue with CHS students and staff.   
Racist slurs and remarks have no place in our schools or anywhere and will not be tolerated. We take these accusations very seriously and are committed to aiding a complete and thorough investigation. In our schools, in our hallways, and in our community, it is a shared responsibility to call out injustice and racism. In Camas School District, we will continue to be unrelenting in our commitment to providing safe, welcoming environments for our students, staff, community, and guests.    
Sincerely,  
Doug Hood  
Interim Superintendent

"Agreed. Sadly there is a lot of Trumpism around these parts...lots of shouty, ill informed people that love berating local government and City staff.

I agree with you r.e. 2016....the more that inadequate govt mails it in, you end up with a crazy awakening when a Trump type gets in and starts blowing shit up. 

I just wish that people like the Steve Hogans actually went out on a limb for things they feel passionate about when people aren't looking as opposed to whilst on the election trail I.e. make the case for doing something, educate, influence the decision and ride it out if it doesn't go well. At least you did something instead of blabbering nonsense afterward about ""group decisions"" or ""the consultants"" (guess what....consultants like money, they tell you what they think you want to hear so that the money keeps flowing).

"Yes, we're on fiber using our own router, getting promised speeds both directions (and I watch them carefully, I'm using an EdgeRouter X to [load balance Comcast and Ziply](https://wp.bitrazor.com/2020/12/19/two-internet-providers/) so I can watch the real-time rates easily.  We're on the north side of Prune Hill, which is a reasonably new fiber install (I think they pulled it in 2015ish).  

The other commenter's concerns are reasonable - this group has a number of installation-problem posts.  The promo pricing is typically $20 less than the long-term price, so my $20/mo 30/30 will go to $40 soon.  In our case, though, everything has been perfectly smooth.  Everybody showed up on time for the install, the installer was great and ran the line where I asked, the automated billing has been fine with no issues.

Comcast's service has also been very reliable (we've been with them for a long time) but they have this practice of raising rates out of the blue every so often.  My bill just went up another $15 last month.  I'm tired of that, so that's why I've been experimenting with Ziply given the low intro rate.  So far so good for us.

"It's important to remember that this whole thing started as Verizon FiOS, which was sold to Frontier in 2009 in a massive territory acquisition.

The service was impossibly shitty due to Frontier not asking the right questions in the due diligence process, and Verizon not delivering the stuff that they knew Frontier would need ""because it wasn't in the agreement"". They used the many-years out of date Verizon gear - my fiber modem had been out of production for like five years at one point, and they kept swapping it for a new ancient artifact every time it failed.

Frontier sold those assets to Ziply in 2020 as part of their bankruptcy proceedings. 

Ziply is owned by a private equity group out of Kirkland, so at least they're semi-local. But they're still motivated by profit. They have committed to ""upgrade"" the system (that's the whole system - OR, WA,  Idaho, Montana) to the tune of $500M, but that's about a third of what they spent do acquire it.

A bunch of that is bringing fiber to places that don't have it as part of a Rural Digital Opportunity Fund cash-grab. That doesn't leave a lot for improving the actual operations, or upgrading the gear. 

I used to run big fiber networks. I can guarantee that bottom feeder prices will give you bottom feeder service, if not now, eventually.  And yeah, they're saying ""promo prices, the real price is X"" but the reality is that when they start bleeding customers as they roll off their promo period, the price is gonna stick.

"As someone who just completed this move from 1100mi away I’ve got a couple insights. 

1.	 Housing market could be described as “Champagne prices, warm beer service”. Rental groups and owners are charging insane “move in” fees, mandatory cleaning fees, “change of services” fees. Like…any imaginary thing that I’ve never seen before in 20+ years of rental and home ownership. It’s a super good time to already own rental properties. Super hard to find something otherwise. 
2.	Be persistent. We called all the prop managers we could find and introduced our family situation as personally as we could. In the end, this paid off. Two different prop mgrs called us with listings before they went live and we ended up taking one of those. 
3.	Pay CLOSE attention to school districts. There are “Camas” addresses that go to Vancouver schools.

"We lived here without kids for a while and whilst it's an adjustment, Im glad we we in when we did as we now have kiddo and feel like the school system and kid activities will be worth it in the long run. 

Lots of pros as everyone has mentioned.

R.e. cons...

City of Camas is growing a lot and town planning is going to be a big issue going forward - its going to put strain on the schools and the local infrastructure. 

Admin. My other concern is that the current administration and council has had a bunch of turnover, high profile fuck ups and is absolutely rudderless. Way out of their depth at running a growing City. 

Politics....The 2 candidates for mayor are godawful. There are also some politically active folks on both sides of the spectrum that pull a lot of strings, stir up noise and manipulate media and voters. People are heated on both sides of spectrum. Everything becomes a big argument, nobody works together. 

Wtf? They City also completely fucked up with allowing a drug rehab facility to muscle in on a foreclosure next to Fox Elementary. It's not even for locals, it's being marketed to Cali residents by a two bit outfit. The City subsequently delayed sharing foia documents containing their shady backroom deals / redacted BS until after the hearing. Residents have taken them to superior court about it. I don't buy any of their puff about being ""citizen focused"" and ""child safety"". I'd be happy to see a rehab facility for locals in Camas by a reputable operator but not next to a fucking school and kids park.

"seems most comments have covered everything, so i’ll talk about food places. cuz of course that an important part of a town you are looking at moving to

Natalies Cafe (right in downtown) is great breakfast, long wait times (but worth it!). decent alternative could be Smitty’s Dine In, good corned beef hash and tuna melts for lunch.

speaking of tuna, if you like seafood Puffin Cafe on the water at the Washougal/Camas port is amazing, love their fish and chips. plus its a cute place and the staff is always great

for more fine dining and for a bit of money, Feast 316 is great, amazing steaks, it is pricey. Tommy O’s isn’t bad either, along with the Hammond, neither are as expensive as 316. however both are still good, could make good places for date nights

i’m not a drinker, but i have heard good things about Grains Of Wrath (GOW) and their food.

and there’s more than just this area, travel up to Mill Plain (not far drive really) can find more big name places, and if you like sushi or chinese cuisine, theres a good place called Eastland. and if you like mexican food i recommend Cathedral (also Mill Plain), great mexcian foo. Camas also has a few of their own mexican restaurants, like Los Dos (they’re ok in my opinion 🤷‍♂️)

of course PDX probably does have more places that serve good food, but thats also due to how big portland is and the space for so many places. honestly i think one of the best parts of moving is finding these places and trying them yourself

also another nice bonus of downtown, as im sure you may already know, theres a theater called Liberty, awesome cute theater, love going there and the prices are much much better than big theater chains",t2_bcvek6r,ScarySkeleton24,0,1628220877.0,0,t1_h7w6x4n,h7w6x4n,True,50north14east,t3_oymwf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/camaswashington/comments/oymwf2/buying_a_house_in_camas_vs_portland/,Buying a house in Camas vs. Portland,/r/camaswashington/comments/oymwf2/buying_a_house_in_camas_vs_portland/h7w6x4n/,2,r/camaswashington,0,2

For us, the pros of Camas for outweigh the cons of Portland with all the issues the city is facing. It’s also super easy to get into Portland, basically a 20 to 30 minute drive to get to most neighborhoods you’d want to spend time in.

For me, I chose camas over other parts of SW Washington because the town has a distinct feel to it, and you don’t feel like you’re living in suburban sprawl. Having a small downtown core with bars, restaurants, a movie theater, etc gives the town a ton of character.

"Pros:

* Great School District
* Small town feel
* The gorge, hiking/biking trails, rivers/lakes all very easy access
* Quite neighborhoods
* No state income tax
* We no longer smell (the paper mill has drastically reduced operations)
* Everything Portland has to offer is a quick trip over the bridge

Cons:   

* Already high housing prices have absolutely skyrocketed
* Property taxes are higher
* Restaurants and shops (even most of the ones everyone here raves about) aren't as good as PDX
* Everything Portland has to offer is ALL THE WAY over the bridge (we just try to time our trips accordingly)

Maybe pro or con depending:  
 
* More conservative
* Lots of development in progress or planned

The isolation is what you make of it. We go to Vancouver virtually every day and Portland several times a week and that's usually plenty for us. Living near HWY 14 probably helps. If you absolutely *crave* city life then it would at least be an adjustment but it's not like we're in the middle of nowhere here.

I always tell people that, if you're not gonna take advantage of the school district, it's worth looking in Washougal or Vancouver instead. You'll get more house for your money there. But Camas is a *fantastic* place to live IMHO and if you're thinking about maybe having kids someday, and you can find something you love and can afford then it should be on your list for sure.",t2_47vz8zt,_noncomposmentis,0,1628185620.0,0,t1_h7u0wv1,h7u0wv1,True,50north14east,t3_oymwf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/camaswashington/comments/oymwf2/buying_a_house_in_camas_vs_portland/,Buying a house in Camas vs. Portland,/r/camaswashington/comments/oymwf2/buying_a_house_in_camas_vs_portland/h7u0wv1/,9,r/camaswashington,0,9

Great school district

Lively and charming downtown

The drive to Portland is not long at all since highway 14 almost never has any traffic and it's pretty much a straight shot.

The views of Mt Hood and the Columbia are amazing

"The law specifically mentioning the ‘free play’ aspect is what is the lynchpin here. As odd as that sounds!

Pinball games are games of randomness with a minor amount of skill. They also aren’t the machines or culture we think of today when we say pinball. Commonly in the history of pinball it was that people would win prizes by playing them. This is the rub. If prizes are attached to play, and the games are much more about random ball bounces, what you actually have is Plinko or Pachinko. And that’s gambling!

So ‘free play’ pinball is specifically machines that have prizes based on the random actions within the machine. Many of these didn’t even have flippers. 

And nothing against camas, but I have a feeling that in the 1980’s it wasn’t at the cutting edge of entertainment here and had many of the older gambling style machines around.",t2_l1rdk,8BitHegel,0,1625724762.0,0,t1_h4g20nd,h4g20nd,True,zztv,t3_ofc2pb,https://www.reddit.com/r/camaswashington/comments/ofc2pb/free_pinball_is_illegal_for_minors_in_camas/,Free pinball is illegal for minors in Camas,/r/camaswashington/comments/ofc2pb/free_pinball_is_illegal_for_minors_in_camas/h4g20nd/,1,r/camaswashington,0,1

It is imperative that we do not let these people intimidate their way into vacating a board seat so they can attempt to hijack our school board and undo all the wonderful progress that has been made by the board and administrators to make (the district) what it is today.”

"Washington, we're about to have some historic high temperatures in our state so it's very important to check your local forecasts on your favorite weather app or weather.gov. There are excessive heat warnings in multiple areas of the state. It's also important to know the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke and to call 911 if potentially facing a heat stroke. These are going to be some uncomfortable days. During the heat, stay hydrated and make sure your pets have shade and water.  And please help us prevent forest fires. There's no need to make an emergency even worse.
▶ Don’t rely solely on fans to keep you cool. While electric fans might provide some comfort, when temperatures are really hot, they won’t prevent heat-related illness.
▶ If you need a cooling center, contact your local county or city to see what their plans are. Spend some time at a shopping mall, grocery store or public library - even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help.
▶ Take cool showers or baths.
▶ Use your stove and oven less to maintain a cooler temperature in your home.
▶ Avoid high-energy activities outdoors.
▶ Drink plenty of fluids and wear light colored clothes.
▶ Check on and take care of those vulnerable to heat (children, those with chronic medical conditions, elderly, pets).
▶ Stay inside during the hottest times of the day (afternoon and early evening).
▶ Be wary of rivers and lakes. The water is still cool and the drowning risk is real. 

HEAT CRAMPS
Signs: Muscle pains or spasms in the stomach, arms or legs
Actions: Go to a cooler location. Remove excess clothing. Take sips of cool sports drinks with salt and sugar. If you are sick and need medical attention, call your healthcare provider first. If cramps last more than an hour, seek medical attention. 

HEAT EXHAUSTION
Signs: Heavy sweating, paleness, muscle cramps, tiredness, weakness, dizziness, headache, fainting, nausea, vomiting
Actions: Go to an air-conditioned place and lie down. Loosen or remove clothing. Take a cool bath. Take sips of cool sports drinks with salt and sugar. Call your healthcare provider if symptoms get worse or last more than an hour.

HEAT STROKE
Signs: Extremely high body temperature (above 103 degrees). Red, hot and dry skin with no sweat. Rapid, strong pulse. Dizziness, confusion or unconsciousness
Actions: Call 9-1-1 or get the person to a hospital immediately. Cool down with whatever methods are available until medical help arrives.

"It's not that he was in over his head so much as he was treated pretty poorly by the City Council members for the most part. Not all of them but most of them. Back-stabbing, pushing back at every turn, sometimes being very disingenuous and at times outright childish.  
  
And I won't tell you the things they did and said to Jamal Fox to get him to where he just wanted out. Barry was full of ideas and really wanted positive change for our little City but the way he and Jamal were treated he just decided that since they pushed out Jamal it wasn't worth it any longer for him.  
  
It was a telling sign on Jamal's very first Council meeting when Council member Greg Andersen's welcoming comment was ""we'll be watching you"" and it got worse from there. Oh and don't forget to watch the Council meeting when Barry was reading his proclamation for Black History Month, almost every single Council member was completely uninterested and either looking at texts, shopping on their PC's or otherwise couldn't care less. That too set the tone for how little they respected Jamal (or people of color). And a ""word"" used by a Council member directly to Jamal that no person should ever use to a man, let alone a black man. It was so easy off his tongue as if that's normal for Camas. These things put Jamal over the edge.  
  
The staff at the City, Barry's direct reports, enjoyed working for him and confided in him about the previous working conditions under previous City Admin/Mayor. He was a breath of fresh air for sure down at City Hall (other than the City Council). Sure, could or should Barry have worked through that? I suppose, but in the end it was affecting his personal life too much and the fight was too much for him.  
  
Barry made some tactical errors for sure, he was uber-focused on working on the City and not so much on talking with press or being out in public which I think hurt him a bit too. Because the local press (if you call them that) pressured people in the City i.e. Council members and business owners, that too was a burden he tried to work through. He dropped our local press because of the way he was treated and yes he should have worked through that, in that he was naïve no doubt.  
  
Barry is one of the nicest, good-hearted people one will ever meet. Maybe that was his downfall, he couldn't stoop to the level similar to the Council members did/do. Ellen Burton is great but during his time, while she was very supportive of Barry she too at times made decisions that didn't make sense at all and any of us who saw would question WTF? But she's great, just like Barry, very nice and wants to do what's right. Why do you think she really decided not to run again? Do you think it was just time? Nope!!  
  
And Melissa Smith not running. You think she didn't have anything but time? Nope, time had nothing to do with her not running again. She was completely done with the Council and how they acted. Melissa was very supportive of Barry but even she couldn't fight the ""good ol' boy's"" down there, or didn't want to any more. She was disgusted and wanted no more of it. Heck, before Barry got elected she was in it for life and thought she'd be there forever, or as long as we'd elect her but the experience of how Barry was treated ruined her image of public office in Camas. For her it wasn't just how Barry was treated, but it exposed the worst in these people and she wanted nothing to do with them.

">The district’s online ThoughtExchange survey, which launched earlier this month, had 645 participants, and asked families: “When you reflect on learning this year, what experiences of learning would you like to see for our students moving forward?”  
The more than 500 shared ideas included a desire for students to attend school in-person, five days a week, during the 2021-22 school year, with more instruction from teachers, an emphasis on critical thinking skills to help students filter and process information, placing students’ needs above all else and ensuring that students are meeting the basic standards for their grade level.  
Greseth said the recovery plan examines what went well in the district during the pandemic — increased access to technology, more flexible learning models to meet students’ and families’ needs, more online options for students, a focus on equity and anti-racism through community equity forums and school-based equity teams, and a strengthening of family partnerships using digital platforms like Zoom and the district’s two-way communication tool, Parent Square — as well as the challenges the district faced during the pandemic, including inequities in access for many students, the inability to reach every student and challenges meeting the social-emotional needs of students, families and staff.",t2_yeqb3a7,Fake_Eleanor,0,1622162963.0,0,t1_gzpd0z0,gzpd0z0,True,Fake_Eleanor,t3_nmlxsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/camaswashington/comments/nmlxsw/camas_school_board_oks_recovery_strategy/,Camas school board OKs recovery strategy,/r/camaswashington/comments/nmlxsw/camas_school_board_oks_recovery_strategy/gzpd0z0/,5,r/camaswashington,0,5

"I saw some of the signs about this and just thought oh yeah...typical Prune Hill folks. Started looking into it a bit but I actually think they have a point here.

They all seem to pitch these facilities as ""for professionals, locals"" etc but then you look at their websites and content and it's focused on out of state folks and very general. The Costa Mesa stories are frightening as once they let it happen once, it just exploded...as did incidents, crime and house values being impacted.

"Camas has its own street grid and we only have one SE. Clark County and Vancouver share the same street grid which is different from Camas’s. 

Those other SE addresses are either in the City of Vancouver or in unincorporated Clark County. Costco is in Vancouver, as are most of the areas immediately east of 192nd such as Westridge, the Terrace, and the Glen. They just happen to be served by the Camas post office so they have a “Camas” address. The post office and zip code came about before the cities. 

The SE addresses outside of SE Camas are actually a good way to distinguish the City of Camas from Vancouver or Clark County places in 98607.

 The city shared that a local station would be placed in E. Vancouver to provide shorter response times, neighborhood patrols, but all those measures are simply 'after the fact' - i.e. the police take a report, not prevent.

Apartment buildings along E. Mill Plain were built, traffic went up, and that same year, local car prowls went up, break ins went up.

$700 is just for labor.

"Did you provide the mount?  If so, that's really, really high.  If not- two techs, 2.5 hrs to install a $270 TV mount is a still high.  However, 2 things: one, I think it's shitty that they used two techs, I dunno why they'd do that, especially considering COVID etc...  Two, 2.5hrs (*'s 2 technicians = 5hrs) to hang a TV mount and TV seems like a ridiculous amount of time to perform a simple task, 4-8 screws and/or some anchors, cordless drill, a laser level, bubble level and a measuring tape is all you need.  I do it in about 20min- but I also work in construction.  Sounds like you got the B team, or the company that you used is hurting, possibly because of COVID.

Doing the math:

$700- [$270 *1.15: mark-up] = $389.50 (cost of labor)

$389.50/2 = $194.75 (per tech to install)

$194.75/2.5= $77.90/hr rate.

Considering load (payroll taxes, parts, insurance, etc...) that's still a bit high- they're probably making $30+/hr.  Though, I'd expect that due to COVID, companies are trying to make a profit where they can.


I am gonna say that you should use this experience as a moment to learn the first rule of having work performed at your home:

Ask for a quote first.

"The good:

* The schools
* Low crime
* Trails and the city continues to invest in even more land for outdoor recreation. I could see Camas becoming a tourist stop as the Trails get built out around Northshore and Green Mountain.  
* The lakes are wonderful.
* Tax advantages
* Closer to Portland/PDX/Dowtown Vancouver than most people think.
* The future.  This place will continue to grow and I believe grow into something special

The bad:

* Lack of diversity

"Good:

* Good schools (Camas)
* Lots of churches. I'm personally not religious, but church goers tend to be pretty friendly and charitable
* Small town vibes (though some might prefer city feel)
* Pretty clean and safe, relatively environmentally conscious
* Big houses with yards
* Close to Portland, PDX airport, and Vancouver
* Trails/forests
* Close to groceries (Safeway, Grocery Outlet, etc)

Bad:

* All houses look exactly the same
* LaCamas Lake is literally green
* No Fiber (stuck with Comcast or Frontier, both suck)

Ok:

* Pretty Quiet most of the time, some may like, some may not
* Activities - mostly limited to trails and swimming in middle of summer
* Restaurant selection - decent selection from Camas downtown to the Camas-Washougal border, though pretty limited compared to Vancouver and Portland. See my list of recommendations [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/camaswashington/comments/k4fmej/best_restaurants_in_the_camaswashougal_area/)
* Housing prices can be relatively high in Camas (still cheaper than Portland however)
* Most jobs (with a few exceptions like WaferTech and Fischer Investments) nearby require a minimum of 30 minutes drive (likely impossible to walk/bike to work)
* Not a lot of good colleges in the area (University of Portland is ok, UW is 3 hours away). PNW in general is not known for the schools, especially compared to California or the North East

"I would have  tough time coming up with Bad, as it pertains to Camas, as a comparison to regional options.   

For context, moved to East Vancouver from SE Portland in 1994, and then to Camas in 2015.   I was born and raised locally, in this region for over 50 years.  I also spent time in the Seattle area.  I have a lot to compare.   Looking at both the Portland and Seattle metropolitan areas, and the many, many small towns that surround those cities.

Camas has:

* Low crime
* Safe, quiet neighborhoods.
* Close access to jobs (Portland, Vancouver)
* Close access to a major airport
* Close to outdoor recreation of all types - coastal, mountain, river, fishing, hiking, camping - pretty much something to do with everything that you could find in Cabellas. 
* Low population density
* comparatively High median and High Average resident incomes (Census data)
* high ""Livability"" scores across the board.
* High performing Schools

On the Ugly/Bad side, once Camas had (mostly past tense) a 'smell'.  

As a child, coming across the I-205 bridge, you often got a whiff of Camas. When we built our home in E Vanc. in 1994, there were times I knew exactly which way the wind was blowing based on smelling the air - that, however, is history.

What Camas does NOT have, is diversity of revenue.  

Camas doesn't have much in the way of remaining Industry to provide diversity of tax base, so major projects are dependent upon existing property taxes, resident taxes, or forced improvements as part of development plans.   

City budget reflects this, and infrastructure projects take longer and have to be scoped down to reflect this reality.",t2_imlky,KG7DHL,0,1610640949.0,0,t1_gj8nthf,gj8nthf,True,isthreeinchesenough,t3_kx14u3,https://www.reddit.com/r/camaswashington/comments/kx14u3/what_are_some_things_that_the_camas_washougal/,"What are some things that the Camas/ Washougal area is known for (The good, the bad, and the ugly)?",/r/camaswashington/comments/kx14u3/what_are_some_things_that_the_camas_washougal/gj8nthf/,9,r/camaswashington,0,9

" Yep.. Not going to disagree that the timing was not in their favor and that continuing with the protest may have not been the best choice :-)

That being said, I wonder if how many more people would have turned out.  Sounds like they had about thirty or so parents.  It's also a shame that it was reported that one parson didn't wear mask. Most were at least responsible but you like to see all of them do so.

As far as the school district message.. I have been on some zoom meetings where the dates and the we're going to be re-evaluated.  

And yes, everything is closed again but I doubt they were closed when this agenda started. I remember seeing website weeks ago.  I am not sure there is a difference between movies,  restaurants, and school.  All of them would require social distancing and masks.  That is the plan from the school district.

Again, thank you for a constructive conversation. I don't really do Facebook or twitter or anything like that. I'm usually online on Reddit for soccer or wine  :-)

"Yeah, some of them may simply want hybrid learning but those I've spoken with, and most of the things I've read, suggest that most who are pushing for the district to reopen simply think we're making to big a deal out of Covid and that schools (and everything else) should just be open. Granted, not everyone thinks the same but that's the general idea.

The district hasn't really gone back and forth. Before the school year started they listed the criteria that needes to be met before students could safely begin returning to in-person learning. They want to transition to hybrid learning gradually and were planning to do so for elementary students first, then middle school, and then high school but have pushed back those target dates because cases are rising again. I believe they were preparing for opening elementary schools when the cases started rising again. The criteria for reopening simply haven't been met yet.

And there's a big difference between movie theaters, restaurants, etc and school. Nobody is required to go to a movie theater or restaurant. Kids are required to go to school. Also movie theaters have been closed again. And restaurants are no longer permitted to have indoor dining. Honestly, it's kind of laughable to hold a protest about opening schools the day after the Governor announced increased restrictions.

Many of us realize that the district is looking to get kids back into school. But at what point?  They have gone back and forth with messages about what is the right time. I don't know what the answer is but I can empathize with these people. they are seeing kids left behind. Some are seeing psychological effects of their kids not being able to socialize.  They are mad because we open up restaurants and movie theaters but we can't figure out any type of hybrid learning environment.

So while they are currently demanding hybrid learning I'm reasonably confident that they will begin demanding a full reopening as soon as the kids are back to part-time since that is their stated goal. I've also had conversations with a few who have signed and that's what I've been told they want.

I understand the importance of getting kids back in school at least part time I feel it's misguided and naive to be demanding anything.

> At a July 20 city council workshop, Hogan told other Camas councilors and McDonnell that he’d been researching the history of the lake and had been working with Lorincz to form a community group that could look at the entire watershed.
> 
> “We started (polluting the lake) in 1883, six years before Washington was even a state,” Hogan said at the workshop meeting. “We’ve been polluting the lake for a long time. But this lake and watershed are a key part of our legacy … and we bear responsibility for this lake.”

> Built in 1883 to support the Camas paper mill operations, the 2.4-mile-long lake is fed by the 43,000-acre Lacamas Lake Basin, which winds through open fields, private farmland and housing developments, collecting water that eventually flows into Lacamas Creek and then into the lake.

"So, Camas has a traditional high school, similar to the two high schools in Wylie, with sports, electives, a.p. classes etc.

Additionally, there are two project-based high schools. There is also a project-based middle school.

The project schools are not like a stem school, but use real world projects to teach multiple subjects at once. The schools are smaller and tend to create their own programs, often in conjunction with the students. There is a good focus on real world skills, like presentation, public speaking, project mgmt, etc.

While the mortality rate for 0-29 is very low, that does not mean there is zero risk. Recovery from influenza or covid19 is not binary, you don't live or die, there are a lot of in-between states that effect the individuals quality of life.  


Even with that, they can still become carriers of the virus and spread it to higher risk factor age ranges like their parents, grandparents, or people in their social and family group that are immunocompromised.  


I do not disagree that kids, especially younger kids, need to socialize. One of my kids is on the spectrum. He has zoom calls on a regular basis specifically to socialize. Even so, a delay to the school year is not the end of the world. Even if it carries out until 2020-02-01, it is not the end all be all of social behavior
