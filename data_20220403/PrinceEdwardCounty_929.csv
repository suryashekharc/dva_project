I think the editorial in The Times is a bit over dramatic...  the only thing I saw in the tourist plan was the issue of parking at some of the more popular waterfront attractions.  There is certainly precedent for resident only parking - my mother in law has had it in Toronto for over 20 years.  Further all residents of The County can go to a local library and get a parking pass for Wellington Beach.

"This is all subject to change with the upcoming tourist season but:

• Roblin lake (park at the playground area)
• Drop off kayak at Wellington Harbour, and then park up on Main, at CML (over the summer), or up at the ball diamond. A bit of a walk back over but totally worth it.
• I believe the Waupoos Marina is still free, it looks run down from the road but people go down there all the time. 
• Tale 62 up like you’re going to Bellville, then pull of at 28. There are wide shoulders to pull off onto and it’s a quiet little river like experience. 

As you network more, you may start meeting people who have waterfront property and will let you access the water from there.

"Spring and Autumn are perfect times to catch what is referred to as a superior mirage from Sandbanks.  It is caused by a temperature inversion where there is a cold layer of air at lake level and a warmer layer of air above it and a hard boundary between the layers due to light or non existent winds.   Light from the buildings gets refracted by the boundary layer between the cold and warm air so you can see things that are normally beyond the horizon.

"Neighborhoods with big lots like this have a really hard time paying for their infrastructure in the long run. It’s too expensive for the tax base actually living there. Typically it’s either minimal infrastructure (like most of the county outside Picton) or paid for buy a treadmill of yet more unsustainable subdivision development at municipal level. Option 2 won’t work if condo corp owns the infrastructure so the alternative is going to be ever increasing condo fees. 

That’s especially true when you’re using uncommon infrastructure, like dedicated solar & water recycling stuff. That isn’t your typically parking/pool POTL condo common elements. I suspect buyers may be participating in a very expensive rural infrastructure experiment.

"I don’t even know where to begin with this show. Objectively, the changes made were all cosmetic, with the cheapest finishes, and with no thought as to how the rooms would realistically function for guests other than to have a selfie. No commercial grade furniture to sustain wear and tear, installation of a single wall sconce for a two-bed room (there’s a reason why there’s usually at least one for each bed), no inclusion of closet or clothing storage, hard to clean tambour headboards, plastic plants everywhere that are probably not fire retardant or resistant. The place is a giant millennial cliché and focuses solely on the worst stereotypes - millennial pink slapped on everything, having a diet of only rosé and avocado toast, faux mid-century modern style (which ironically, they paint over authentic elements from that era to a white that’s completely devoid of personality). Vapid is what comes to mind as the definition of what “Junify” truly means. It’s insulting that they’d charge luxury pricing upwards of $300-500 per night for the sham.

Worst of all, they take constant jabs at the Sauble Beach community that they claim to support. Within the first 15 minutes of the first episode they point their noses in the air to the lack of alternative milk lattes, that it has nothing to offer outside of summer, or suggest by the end of the show that the town wouldn’t be worth staying in without their superficial motel. I wouldn’t be surprised if Sauble Beach residents resented their city girl condescension. Not once do they acknowledge the local history, the Indigenous land, or look into partnering with local small businesses.

The only saving grace is Rick the contractor, who clearly can’t stand the women and gives them much needed reality checks and shut downs.

"Where I live now, the homeless just set up tents in the city parks. Maybe vote conservative as their plan to change the capital gains tax on housing would encourage a lot more building. Idk about this Shambhala field work camp, maybe it’s just me and maybe the people of the county have changed but from what I remember I’d say there would be a 95% chance of things…digressing. Going to be brutally honest here. the county has apparently changed, stop holding on to an idealized past. Vote in people on a local level which will change the severance by-laws, foster more forms of industry than the one trick pony of tourism. I don’t mean industry which is B2B for the tourism sector, I mean heavy industry. Most people don’t know the county has natural gas underneath it (ever wonder why some wells have sulphur in the water?) from what Iv been told it wasn’t economically viable in the 1950-1970 but with what fracking can do these days..I’m sure it could create some year round jobs. As it’s pretty clear what the county use to be is dead and your plan is to set up a rave camp to be able to placate to the status quo? Why not think bigger? Have some self respect! Channel that sense of anger into aggressive, critical action for how the local government and remote workers have been humiliating, disrespecting and exploiting people.

"I like your vision here, though I think keeping things at this camp from getting unruly is easier said than done based on my experience. Figure out how to do that and I bet you could make this viable through proper channels with a little effort.

I know people with land (assuming this specifically doesn’t need to be tourist-quality camping land) who’d agree to host in exchange even for $400/month of general landscaping and fence maintenance work. That’s the kind of arrangement where everyone wins, including the community which gets left better as a result of it.

Zoning might be a challenge, but anything is doable with special permission from council. There is already specific support in the zoning by law for rough short-term accommodactions for temporary farm workers. This is the same, it’s just the housing situation has shifted that problem to other industries, even ones that pay a solid wage don’t pay for a bed nearby.

Housing in the county is a crisis so we should consider all options. Strict rules against lot severance in the county mean there are a lot of former city dwellers on 50+ acre lots they had to buy in order to build a vacation house but can’t/don’t know how to maintain. With STAs filling anything that they’re able to, workers are getting squeezed, it’s not right.

There needs to be a more flexible solution, housing **is** a crisis here, and council needs to adapt to this reality. So... you should write to your councillor :)

"I'm almost done watching his, one more episode to go. My thoughts.

I'm so torn about the two ladies. To get this out of the way, their voices are intolerable. At first I thought they weren't even Canadian, who talks like that around here? I know people their age but they talk normal not like these two women.

I see them designing the place, working so hard and making hard decisions. I'm impressed. Then along the way they make boneheaded decisions that drive me insane. I'm no hotelier, I'm not in the industry at all so take my opinion for what it is. I thought the A pillar structure would have been good for wedding receptions. You get the wedding people staying in the motel plus now you get the reception, booze, everything that goes with it. A big payday no?

The place looks too cluttered but I'm a minimalist so I'm biased. They have way too many plants and to make it worse I think most are fake anyway. A few plants yes but they overdid it IMO. The neon signs are tacky. The place will look dated in a few years. If it was me designing it I would have made it look more neutral or timeless; I don't know maybe a beach theme or even like a rustic style? Also their design choices makes it look kinda cheap-ish. They're clearly going for young women like themselves, nothing wrong with that.

They got rid of the hot tub, big mistake IMO.

Anyway it's not all bad and I do commend them for launching a business in the middle of a pandemic, it takes guts and smarts and an awful lot of hard work to do that.

They charge north of $400 a night for a motel with hardly any amenities. To me it's overpriced and I wouldn't stay there but from a business point of view if they're filling up the place more power to them. They say charge what the market can bear, right?

"My wife and I binged this last night and were just yelling at the TV most of the time at all the dumb decisions they were making like painting over the wood and trying to fix up the restaurant while working on the motel which split their budget and ended up having to make cuts on both.

It also killed me how they would say they don't want to make the place too ""girly"" looking but then go and paint everything different shades of pink.

I think the only thing we agreed with them on was with what they did with the A-frame.

"You had me until the last paragraph. If we are going to go that route, I find a majority of the tourists entitled trash. Especially the last few years. People have had to actually put up signs saying 'no pooping' and 'please don't use our property as a toilet'. I have had some terrible experiences including being run off the road  by out of town drivers (once on my motorcycle), watched them toss garbage wherever they want,   gave another a heads up that (in a very friendly way)  if he parked there he would get a ticket, only to be told to fuck off. We had a hidey hole where we swam that was discovered by tourists. Which would be fine, except it was then over run with garbage and empties, with the icing on the cake being a guy that whipped his dick around, 50 feet from a family with young children. That access is now blocked off. I won't even get into the amount of times I've witnessed staff being treated like garbage or all the issues surrounding COVID. I've accepted minor inconveniences like no Timmies or beaches from May-Sept and driving 40 minutes out of town to get my groceries. And this is getting long so I won't talk about the frustration with our council who did not adequately prepare for the tourism that they pushed so hard for. Usually I enjoy talking to visitors. I like hearing where they are from and when they talk about the County it gives me a  renewed love of my home. Yes, some locals can be a$$holes but overall, most of us are just tired of the nonsense and disrespect which seems to get worse every year.

"ok this is some intense BS.  


Sandbanks listed in this article like right at the top. They get their grapes from Niagara and in the US because they are a mainstream winery and they are all about volume. Is this a sponsored placement or something?  


One of the wineries that should be top of the list is Potter Settlement in Tweed, Ontario. They could be the most award winning winery in all of Canada. They have a beautiful landscape and if you go on a tour there, you'll learn way more about wine than visiting all the wineries in Prince Edward county combined. You probably won't find anyone more passionate about wines than Sandor Johnson.

"> COVID and remote working opportunities

I think this is especially important. We moved to the county 2 years ago, I have been working remotely for 4 years now and I dreamed of leaving the city for years. My partner and I settled on PEC since it offered an urban-lite culture (we can find things to do, and people are for the most part progressive thinking), but a rural and quiet lifestyle.

COVID seems to have changed a lot of the ideas in my old co-workers heads. Lots of folks in tech. will likely not go back to working in an office unless they really enjoyed it previously. The others are likely going to start hunting for housing well outside the city.

But what can you do... I lived in Toronto between 2007 and 2019, and I could share the same gripes about how Queen street changed so much, how the east end used to be more affordable, how triplexes at Lansdowne and Bloor used to go for 750k, etc. Everywhere is changing at the end of the day.",t2_8qrle,lingodayz,0,1614973159.0,0,t1_gpt3uq4,gpt3uq4,False,chops_big_trees,t3_lyeg3u,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceEdwardCounty/comments/lyeg3u/county_real_estate/,County real estate,/r/PrinceEdwardCounty/comments/lyeg3u/county_real_estate/gpt3uq4/,4,r/PrinceEdwardCounty,0,4
"The new Official Plan that Council approved may slow down some of the severances on agricultural lands. I believe it's now limited to one severance and they are actively trying to focus development into the settlement areas. That doesn't mean people won't be trying for re-zoning applications but I do think in the future it's likely to slow things down. That might also mean increased demand for rural land which has not yet been severed (or the prices of rural houses / existing severances). Tough to say.

The County is certainly changing rapidly and it's going to be a different place in 5 years. There's some good and some bad. The key is focusing on sustainable development and year-round residents as opposed to short term accommodations. 

It's not just The County though... lots of places are booming with housing becoming increasingly less affordable in the GTA and people are looking much further out for housing as a result of COVID and remote working opportunities than they ever would have considered before.

"It's part of the larger move away from urban areas to rural ... now that a city dweller can get most services they could want in the city out here (see: Starlink) it's an option where it never was before. Plus add the proximity to great restaurants, wineries, breweries ... it makes the County super attractive.

Once the pandemic restrictions are lifted & things find a new normal I expect this to subside somewhat but not totally ... there are a lot of people who are exploring the idea of working remotely, maybe going into the office for a day or two a week, and employers are supporting this ... which again makes this area desirable.

"Ask for at least half a dozen quotes. You’ll be lucky if 3/6 return your call, and if more than one actually shows up, I’d be surprised. It’s incredibly difficult to get landscapers, fence builders, etc, to actually SHOW UP here. I’ve had literally dozens flake on quotes and follow-up appointments. Example: recently had a guy come by and roughly quote me a large landscaping job of $15K, said he would need to crunch the numbers before sending a formal quote, I said great and asked for that quote plus a couple other options (if we do x but not y, if we do x and y but not z, that kind of thing) and he just never followed up. Didn’t return my call, either. Multiple different jobs, multiple companies and freelancers, they just don’t show up. Sometimes you get a text the next day “ya sorry I was busy” but usually not.

"Lots of good suggestions in this thread.

If you’re going this weekend, check out Campbell’s Orchard. Apples are fresh right now and the craft cider (Apple Falls Cidery) is fantastic.

I like Chardonnay and for me Exultet is the best in Ontario. It’s out of the way but Lighthall is nearby and they’re nearly as good as well as Long Dog if Pinot is your thing. A pretty accomplished winemaker from Niagara, Derek Barnett, is making some really interesting wines these days at Karlo Estates also worth checking out.

A walk along Lakeshore Beach in Sandbanks, North Beach or even Wellington Beach is pretty nice this time of year. There are also three solid trails in Sandbanks to see some nature (Cedar Sands, Dunes and Woodland) that are good for a casual walk. I go for one of these every weekend.

My favorite farm stand is on Sandy Hook Rd, between the roundabout and County Rd 10. They have a white hut and a haybale spider out front with a parking area in behind it. Fresh eggs are everywhere, if you’re in an AirBnB/STA find breakfast eggs roadside not at the grocery store.

I have to second Blumen, long time local favourite restaurant for fancy meal. They have Exultet on their wine list, never seen it elsewhere except maybe the Drake when they first opened. Maybe late to book for this weekend, if so check out County Canteen or the Vic in Picton for something casual.

"FLOSSIE’S SANDWICH PARLOUR. They are at Carson’s Garden + Market. A small little “shed” attached to the market with an outdoor living room as they describe on their website. The best sandwiches I’ve ever had in my life, and our meal there has been added to my most memorable food experiences list. We even went back a second day to grab another sandwich in between our lunch and dinner reservations lol. When porky met petuina and Carson’s serendipity were our favourites,
with the eggplant parm one following close behind 

We also really enjoyed the old salt cocktail pop up and sausage vendor at the grange winery. 

Trail estates had very unique wine and a very informative tasting session (by reservation only, $25 for 6 tastings)

I really like closson chase if nothing more than for the purple barn and patio area. Their wine is decent too.

Lakeside motel patio for drinks had great ambiance, however we showed up the night of our reservation and the patio was closed bc it was too cold. We are able to get in the following night, but definitely try to plan it for during the day and/or when it is warm and nice out otherwise you run the risk of it being closed.

The Old Third isn't too far off from there either and is pretty and has a fresh pasta bar. Then on Wilson Rd, you can check out Gillingham Brewery, Domaine Darius and Carson's Garden Market.

"Sorry if I'm repeating what has been said. We moved here just over 20 years ago. We absolutely loved it for the first 15-16 years. Great place to raise our children. I'm not happy here from May-September, still LOVE it fall to spring but will probably sell and move in the next year or two. Yes, this year was exceptionally crazy, but it's been getting steadily worse the last few years. Just not for us anymore. Even with the new STA bylaw, there are still alot. STAs, b&bs, camping, inns, motels etc. Most of our friends have or will move as well. On the other hand, I know a lot of people who have no issues dealing with the summer craziness and will likely stay forever. 
We use Eastlink for internet and their service and customer service have been phenomenal. I've worked from home online since March, we stream all our TV and both my son and husband are gamers. We have had zero issues or lag.
The County does tend to have its own weather system. There have been many times I've called into work (I work in Belleville) because we have blizzard like conditions just to have my boss laugh because Belleville was clear and sunny.
I'm thinking if the Ottawa traffic doesn't bother you, the summers wouldn't be too bad for you here. The County is incredibly beautiful. Even after 20+ years I am still in love with it. 
Picton is growing very quickly with a lot of new subdivisions being built. Housing is very expensive, but maybe not compared to Ottawa?

"We moved here in Dec of last year. Obviously work impacts many decisions on where to live in the County - we're just out of Picton and have barely-acceptable internet, tho word is that we should see some improvements , just don't know when.

Yes Airbnb - STAs  (short term accommodations) are a real concern. Where we are it's not an issue but I have heard that it's a problem for some. Having said that I understand that there is now a by-law that requires licensing, but of course that's not easy to enforce.

Overall tho all the things that make the County wonderful are still here - it's amazing to be so close to wonderful wineries & breweries, awesome food (even in covid times there's amazing take-out), and the water is always 5 mins away.

I will say that both Bloomfield & Wellington are pretty busy in the summer - even last weekend we drove through both & both were still crowded.

"Since 2000, PEC has focused on tourism, and smartly so. 

That was 20 years ago and I think its safe to say that PEC has arrived as a destination. Not a single cent more of budget money should be go towards it. In the age of social media and hashtags, this place sells itself. 

There needs to be a pivot towards tourism management. This summer has been insane. Born and raised here and not one of these angry locals that is surprised every summer by how busy we get it. This year has been different, though. 

Its a perfect storm happening. As locals we thought that maybe this was “our” summer to enjoy things to ourselves here in PEC, due to the pandemic. At the same time, tourists want to get away from their locked down hubs and so here we are. Locals are much less tolerant and tourists that much more entitled (for lack of a better term). 

If you’re coming here, try to think about that before blocking someone’s driveway because you need to go sit in sand or take a shit next to a dumpster because the mean teenagers at McDonald’s won’t let you in without a mask.

"I agree with better municipality planning. I think we have enough us vs. them mentality, divisions  and identity politics in the world right now and quite frankly it isn’t very helpful. In many cases, the debate is a thinly veiled vehicle for racism or xenophobia.

Some of the comments repeatedly called for more respect from tourists and I wish they would elaborate on what they mean or provide specific examples to create opportunities for education. The county deserves to have its own voice and point of view heard. If there are specific customs that would make life more pleasant in the county for everyone, make them known and give the tourists  a chance to abide.  It could even be considered one of the County’s many unique charms.

If the petition were to instead focus on being able to better benefit financially from the influx of tourists to use to towards things like hospital and school upgrades, new community centers or promoting local entrepreneurship, I would wholeheartedly agree.

"This is such a difficult topic to debate or discuss because there are both sides of the story, both sides of the coin. But the hard truth is: we need the tourists in the summer months to survive all year long. Yes, we had jobs before tourism, but the tourism has brought many more jobs with it. I can see though how the locals feel overrun in their own home.
I really think It's a matter of finding a way to make it work for you. This is the time to get creative and investigate what is out there to see how you can get into this market yourself and flourish from all of the attention on our County!

"IMO this fight is closely related to that of the fight against gentrification. The people negatively affected really don’t know how to deal with it (understandably).

Some smart regulations and infrastructure improvements can mitigate the increased tourism numbers.

"Great thread. I never realized there was a PEC Reddit. We've been going there bi-annually for 5 years now ever since we ""discovered"" it. Wish we had known about how awesome PEC was before! We're about 4 hours away near Montreal and this is our go-to quick vacation spot.

Probably too late, and I know the request is for breweries and restaurants but I feel like doing a tasting/visit to Kinsip is a must. We go each time, it's great. Have to book in advance now for a tasting. Hopefully this info is useful to anyone else doing research.

Barley Days had some good beers we purchased, but Parson's was definitely the more memorable experience from the setting to the beers themselves. The Miller house on Lake on the Mountain is awesome if the patio is open. More for snacking but have a decent selection of ciders and beers, and the setting is awesome. Bit overpriced though.

Midtown brewery is indeed great.

555 has good snacks and pizza and some of their beers were excellent, some less... they switch them up (at least in between each visit we do!)... I also love their hats for some reason so I buy one each time lol.

">  Demand for real estate in Prince Edward County, Ont., exploded in June as pandemic-weary Toronto residents seek an escape from the city.

> The number of properties that traded hands doubled in June from May, says Treat Hull of the brokerage Treat Hull and Associates. Sales were also jumped sharply from June, 2019.

> The average price, meanwhile, climbed 14 per cent from June of last year to hit $600,000.

> Mr. Hull sees more than a burst of activity stemming from pent-up demand: he believes there is a tectonic shift underway in real estate that will likely result in high demand for Prince Edward County properties for a long time to come.

> Mr. Hull says the coronavirus and the measures imposed to contain it seem to have prompted many people to think about a change in lifestyle. As restrictions were eased and the market began to open up again, buyers swarmed to Prince Edward County, which is about two hours east of Toronto.

> “I think it’s psychological. The risk didn’t change overnight,” Mr. Hull says. “All of a sudden they just returned to the market. I was gobsmacked.”

> Meanwhile, the number of resale listings fell far short of the same month last year. Months of inventory stood at just over four months at the end of June.

> Months of inventory is an indicator of the balance of supply and demand. It measures how long the pool of current listings would last at the current rate of sales. The current level has not been seen since the bubbly days of 2016-2017.

> Prince Edward County’s mix of farmland, beaches, charming towns and fine dining have made the headland jutting into Lake Ontario a popular weekend destination for visitors from Toronto for many years.

"So it really depends on where you are in The County.  I'm on CR12 in West Lake and our only options for internet are KOS, Xplornet and Bell - all 3 options use a wireless connection to a tower.  We were with KOS until May this year when we switched over to Xplornet.  It was great until the tourists arrived in June and then it went to ok during the day and unusable after 7pm.  I've herd others complaining about the same with Xplornet.  We are now with Bell and it is much faster, doesn't drop out and we can stream 2 simultaneous Netflix feeds at night.  Compared to what you get in a city or bigger town it is expensive and slow.  My service is 25mbps down and 2mbps up.  When I lived in Oakville I got 70/15 for 1/3 the price via cable....but the downside is that I was living in Oakville.  The thing to remember with Wireless is that KOS and Xplornet need to buy tower bandwidth from Bell and they are reluctant to do so to improve summer service  when they will just end up over provisioned in the winter.  Since Bell owns the infrastructure to their own towers it doesn't really cost them anything to overprovision so if you can get Bell wifi it is probably going to be better than anything else.

If you live in Picton you might be able to get Eastlink cable which will get you decent bandwidth for your internet and I see that Bell has been installing fibre in Bloomfield so that may improve things for residents there.  Otherwise I've read that people have good results with Tri Canadian Energy but again service areas are limited - you might not get it where you live.

For cellular service, I was with Freedom Mobile but it is roaming service in most of The County and I needed to remember to make a phone call once every morning to ""wake it up"" or anything inbound would go to voicemail.  I switched that service to Bell about a month ago and it is only a few $ more than my Freedom service was and it is reliable.  Rogers is about the same price and people I've talked to say the same about reliability.",t2_2a1tbl,cjmpeng,0,1594687145.0,0,t1_fxzl79j,fxzl79j,True,Eisgboek,t3_hqp7sv,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrinceEdwardCounty/comments/hqp7sv/internet_phone_providers/,Internet & Phone Providers,/r/PrinceEdwardCounty/comments/hqp7sv/internet_phone_providers/fxzl79j/,2,r/PrinceEdwardCounty,0,2

I also agree with the Midtown reco. Sand and Pearl is delicious but I find it very expensive. Haven’t been this season yet, though.

Strato’s is the best pizza in the area, as far as I’m concerned.

Jerkebago is amazing Jerk chicken.

Kaleidoscope makes the best bread in the world and they deliver other ready-made items, too. You can order online or pick up at The Counter in Consecon. They also sell great treats.

Prince Eddy’s brewery is great. Closson Chase is my favourite winery.

Lakeshore Farms has incredible donuts.

62 and county road 1 are both asphalt. I’m not sure what is being done differently but one guess is there might be more proactive salting / brining of the provincial roads (before/during a storm) whereas I don’t see nearly as much put on the county roads so you get a lot more patchy ice left over on the road surface that can’t easily be scraped off by a plow.
