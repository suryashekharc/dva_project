The town of St. George has an outdoor activities after school program that takes kids to do all sorts of fun stuff where they can meet kids [here](https://www.sgcity.org/outdooradventureprograms/). There‚Äôs also a site/Instagram account that brings up lots of activities to do for kids [here](https://www.stgeorgeutahkids.com/). St. George is all about youth sports so getting them involved in city sports would probably be a great way too. 

As far as piano teacher/nanny I don‚Äôt know personally but our local Facebook pages have been helpful with recommendations when we have asked. For the swim teacher- there‚Äôs an aquatic center in Santa Clara that would be worth checking out. 

Good date night activities- depends on what sort of thing you‚Äôre into but we like to visit the desert garden and watch the sunset at Dixie rock (during the week so it‚Äôs not busy), get Ramen at Slirpin‚Äô Ramen Bar, get BBQ and listen to live music Friday nights at Dub‚Äôs BBQ on Sunset, go hiking literally anywhere, go to Tuacahn for a show or musical, mountain bike, road bike, go climbing, go into Snow Canyon, etc. There‚Äôs lots to do here if you love the outdoors and Vegas is only 2 hours away if you want to go to a show or something.",t2_r9iqq,Pat_Foleys_Dad,0,1649010517.0,0,t1_i3946pz,i3946pz,True,DiscombobulatedAge30,t3_tvbpas,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/tvbpas/moving_to_stgeorge_this_august_any_tips_are_much/,Moving to St.George this August!

"Okay - I'm being a little hyperbolic. The St. George metro area has the highest per-capita water consumption in the country - and likely in the world. Our local water sources are almost tapped out and being in the biggest drought in 1200 years isn't helping. The County's ace-in-the-hole was to build the Lake Powell Pipeline - and that is not going to happen. Serious water conservation and rational water-pricing aren't going to happen either. Growth will continue unrestrained because that is what is overwhelmingly desired. At some point this growth will hit a water wall and the results will not be pretty.

I moved because it was essentially the same weather/environment as where I was (the high desert, Palmdale/Lancaster in CA), but better schools for my kid, and a better community all-around. I'm not a fan of the religiousness, but as long as you keep yourself out of my business, I don't care about yours. I do feel safer here, than I did there.

That said, I probably wouldn't have been so open to it without family that had previously moved here. A lot of trips visiting, and it just seemed like where I was already living, without the criminal element and better resources. Bought a house in 2020 because it was obviously going to go off the rails, and I'm pretty happy with everything.

"Wow that's really odd.  I've actually had convos with a few of their fiber techs here saying other TDS markets are going 2Gbps but no word on when for St George, and if so probably only their fiber service.  

But I got really fed up with the 20 up and needed much more for work. So I set up a wireless point to point beam to a location in Santa Clara with fiber about a mile from me in St George. And I now get symetrical gig century link fiber.
 Exciting also because all of Santa Clara is getting utopia fiber (huge in SLC)and they even offer up to 10Gbps residential.

"Apparently I woke up in an alternate universe, because I VIVIDLY remember having multiple conversations with TDS reps about upgrading to 1.5 from 1 (when will I be able to upgrade, is it available in my area, is my current modem compatible, difference in price, etc), then I remember upgrading, but I just called them the other day to confirm after you asked and the CSR told me that not only was I only on 1Gbps, but they‚Äôd never offered 1.5. The strange thing is I changed my auto bill pay to pay the higher 1.5Gbps price (about $178), but because I supposdly  only had 1Gbps the whole time and it was only supposed to cost $107, I‚Äòve apparently built up just over $1,000 in credit.   
So if they never offered that speed, why was I paying so much more per month? Why do I remember all those convos?? It‚Äôs all very strange.

"I have 1 Filipino friend but he's moving in 3months haha. I have to go to vegas every month or so to grocery shop for asian food, which I'm not really that unhappy about.  Any excuse to goto vegas is a good one.  
The aforementioned asian store in st george has been closed for some time now so that's not an option. 

I've been here for almost 2 yrs bc of school and I've enjoyed the outdoors when I had the chance to do so. I feel relatively isolated from the general community because I live near school and only goto the gym,  costco, and occasionally to eat out and drink at 1 of only 3 bars in town. (Night life is non existent here. Last call is at fucking 1145 for fuck's sake). I haven't personally experienced any racism here as an asian, people are friendly. But I do get stares from time to time. But I feel like it's less so now as st george is getting more and more diverse. Couple times I've heard of people being rude to my friends were from people unhappy about newcomers in general, not neceassarily because of race, but who knows. AND it is trump country through and through (ralleys, parade, flags during elections) so I'm sure that'll be a change from WA.

We have couple mediocre sushi spots, a decent ramen shop, okay Indian restaurant, couple almost decent pho/thai restaurants, and apparently every white persons fav asian restaurant around here: sakura. The rumor is that someone is trying to open a korean bbq spot too in few months.

"That's all well and good, but for me, I'd rather cross the street and avoid most people than deal with an awkward smile or hand wave or whatever.  That could change from day to day depending on how anxious I'm feeling in the moment, though. There's a spectrum of what people do or do not want to deal with and how they deal with it. Just because you personally can give a little wave, doesn't mean others are ok with that. Everyone is going through their own stuff, they navigate the world through their own individual experiences, and what you may think is a slight is just some other person's way of dealing with life. Some people are legitimately scared of other people. Maybe they've had some sort of trauma and now they are hyper vigilant with making sure they are physically safe, whether or not you think they should be because of how YOU think you appear to be. Instead of being offended or wondering if there's a problem with a certain demographic of people within a city, maybe give them some slack, understanding and compassion.

Also, as a woman (because women have been socially trained to be hyper aware of their surroundings and do things to preserve their safety while out in public that men wouldn't even think to do, because that's the world we live in), you never know who has nefarious intentions-- even if they dress nicely. I mean, look at Ted Bundy-- he was a hottie and was very nicely dressed and well-educated, and no one suspected him of being a serial killer. So, no, there isn't a problem with people trying to avoid you on the street.

St George area ...

\-Ideal spot for hiking and many outdoor sports

\-Snow Canyon State Park is underrated - truly picturesque, and practically right in the middle of town

\-Zion National Park, Bryce Canyon, and other natural showstoppers are close-by

\-Desert wildlife spotting, birding, botany can be diverse and rewarding

\-Decent regional airport

\-Las Vegas with its shows, entertainments, international airport, shopping, etc. is just under two hours drive

\-The winters are mild, the summer is very hot indeed, and the rest of the year is temperate, dry, and sunny

\-Cultural activities are limited. There's a lot of amateur theatre - some good, some bad. Occasionally there will be a notable concert or stand-up comedian who pass through Tuacahn (a local amphitheater). There is a burgeoning film community, being led by FMASU and the Desertscape Film Festival, but for regular movie-going there are just two mediocre movie theatres - they are serviceable, not more.

\-Nearby Cedar City has a Tony Award-winning stage theatre and they're better than you'd expect for a small Utah location

\-Most restaurants are franchises and far from unique. A few quality places have started to change this. Namely: Onyx Cafe, Red Fort, and I can list off a few more, if requested

\-Dixie University has a dubious reputation for with political machinations

\-Much of the demographic is right-wing and Mormon Christianity is the predominate religion. Personally, I think it is pretty friendly place overall and it is growing rapidly. I won't dispute anyone's claims of discrimination, but in my own circles there have plenty of foreigners, church-goes, ""ex-Mormons,"" etc., and everyone gets along. There's a Native American reservation next door and a substantial Hispanic-expat community

\-A vehicle is mandatory; public transport is poor, and if someone saw you walking downtown, they would assume you're in trouble and need a ride

\-Low crime rate

\-There are two city pools and a couple community recreation centers. There are plenty of gyms, bike trails, parks, tennis courts, etc..

I don‚Äôt drink and my husband has had I think maybe 3 drinks in the last year? So while I‚Äôm not personally worried about the presence of alcohol I can see that the community reaction to it demonstrates a larger issue? Atypical world view? Not sure what to call it tbh. 

I‚Äôve unfortunately met my fair share of Q people. Thats problematic. But we‚Äôll see if the movement dies down a bit more. 

The COVID response is disappointing as well. I‚Äôm about a month away from finishing my masters in public health so I definitely understand what it should have been.

Bar scene is pretty controversial. They opened a brewery and cocktail bar next to the pub and hotel bar, and now the city counsel members are afraid of a ""bar district"" and say melodramatic things like ""Is that where we are headed"" as if walkable entertainment will kill their daughters.

If you're not used to State owned liquor stores they're pretty hard to get used to. You can't get wine or strong beers in any grocery store, it's illegal. 

It's Trump country, with a weirdly high number of Qultists. The libraries get a lot of methheads, like most public spaces do, who believe all sorts of crazy Q conspiracies.

The Covid response here was pretty pitiful, lots of people very publicly talking about how they're proud of not helping others.

"The reason that google says that 85,000 people live in St. George is because the city limits are set and they are only just learning about 'building up, not out'. If you look at the growth of Washington County in the last decade, you will see the issue that is being had. Housing is an issue here, as in many places, but the demand is definitely outweighing the supply currently. Traffic sucks at the normal times of day, and there are intersections that you will always be stopped at. Chain stores have taken over and it seems like all the local shops are closing. This place is turning into every other tourist town. I'm probably being overly nostalgic.

"I doubt that it will become a huge metropolitan area, but it is growing quickly.

"I've purchased there as a new resident in town - once. My experience was just OK but I am not interested in going back - I'll shop anywhere but there just because it has a very weird vibe. My purchase was around April last year. Went in, a very very nice sales young lady helped us and so politely answered our questions and just let us be while we looked around. I always have to think my purchases real well so I came back two weeks later ready to buy and I asked for the lovely sales girl only to find she had quit the day before. Apparently, it was due to customers being difficult to dealt with paired with the low inventory and slow shipping, at least that is what her collegue shared with us. I about walked out except I really liked the piece of furniture. They helped us order it, created an ""account"" and then told us once it arrived we had to pick up at their Hurricane wearhouse - kinda of a pain really but didn't want it shipped to my address. Had no problem accepting a cash payment. But I have noticed that if you purchase ANYTHING at any furniture store around here, they want you to create an ""account"" and provide all your data, even if you do not need it delivered - bizarre if you ask me. Sometimes I'd rather buy at a thrift store just to avoid the hassle of creating an ""account"". So, no, we were not asked to leave through the back door nor provide drivers license.

"Once the tech comes out to install it, they shouldn't have a problem using your modem (I used to work for them doing installs and tech support back when they were called Baja). If you want to be 100% sure you don't have an issue, just call and order it over the phone. That way you can give them a heads up that you'll be using your own modem. 

The only other advice would be to remember that the modems I linked to are just that, modems. You'll still also need a wireless router. If you hired me to install it and had a decent budget I would put in a Ubiquiti system, but those cost a few hundred $$$ (I think they're worth it but that's a whole different discussion).

They're WiFi 6 compatible and support WPA3 security. 

The sub-$100 wireless routers available are usually garbage and have incredibly weak security (most Netgear routers can be hacked in less than a second regardless of how strong your password is because of a WPS vulnerability), and we use WiFi so much in todays world that it's worth spending a little bit of money to do it right.

"Yeah I had to fight them tooth and nail when I upgraded to the 1Gb plan and I didn't want to use their modem. They finally allowed customer owned modems and I switched ASAP. Now I'm on the 1.5 Gb plan and still using my own modem, so if someone tells you differently just ask to speak to someone else. 

With cable internet, modems are rated by their download and upload streams. So higher speeds typically require more down/up streams. The SB6183 is capable of 16x4 (16 downstreams, 4 upstreams) ([https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Surfboard-SB6183-RB-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B01ERK1JLM/ref=sr\_1\_26?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-26](https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-Surfboard-SB6183-RB-Certified-Refurbished/dp/B01ERK1JLM/ref=sr_1_26?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-26)) and the SB6190 is a 32x8 (32 down, 8 up) ([https://www.amazon.com/ARRlS-Surfboard-Approved-Spectrum-Xfinity/dp/B088HHT41L/ref=sr\_1\_3?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-3](https://www.amazon.com/ARRlS-Surfboard-Approved-Spectrum-Xfinity/dp/B088HHT41L/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=sb6190&qid=1645137795&s=electronics&sr=1-3))

So if you're on a lower tier plan (100 Mbps) the SB6183 would be fine. You just need to double check with TDS as to what the stream requirements are for the plan you're on. If this is all just sounding like technical jargon, just order the SB6190 and you're guaranteed it will work. 

&#x200B;

When it comes to signing up, there should be an option for ""customer owned modem"". If you don't see it, just call them and order over the phone. Keep in mind that using your own modem only works if you're not bundling your internet with phone. If you're using their phone service you're going to HAVE to use their modem. Keep in mind that if you need phone and want to use your own modem, just go elsewhere for the phone service (aka don't bundle with TDS).

"For most areas TDS will be the fastest option (by a long ways). Infowest has been here since dial up days and is an awesome local company, but sadly their DSL/wireless speeds just don't compare to TDS. Centurylink's DSL is abysmally slow in most areas (I'm talking 10 Mbps), but they're putting fiber into some of the new developments (Desert Canyon by the airport for example) and retrofitting it into some of the older neighborhoods (they're installing it into The Knolls and some areas in Washington Fields as we speak). Go Fiber is another option but their service area is super limited. For your specific area I would just double check that Centurylink's fiber isn't available, and go with TDS. 

One little bit of advice if you go with TDS (I guess this applies to all ISP's though) is to buy your own modem. If you do a bundle deal and use them for VoIP, you'll have to use their modem, but if you're just getting internet from them you can get a great refurbished Surfboard modem from Amazon for \~$30.",t2_ciw7u,agrowland,0,1645128394.0,0,t1_hxcoq3d,hxcoq3d,True,Any-Lavishness3540,t3_surrcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/surrcg/who_is_the_best_internet_provider_in_st_george/,Who is the best internet provider in St. George?

"My mom is POC/Filipino and I don't recall her safety ever being compromised, there may have been minor instances of racial profiling but nothing that's threatened her. Her anxiety is through the roof though with the asian-hate news. 

I've lived here my whole life and as a half-asian I personally haven't experienced any threats to my safety, as I'm mostly white-passing, although I did still experience some stereotyping / bullying in highschool. There weren't many asians in my graduating class, but things may have changed since I've been in school.

Ultimately, I don't think we've had any cases of asian-hate crimes here. But many here are right-leaning / [support Trump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Df8665fEJI) / deny COVID / [anti-mask](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vh-nlY3U6M) / [all-lives matter](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/gx6kn7/counter_protester_has_a_tantrum_at_george_floyd/) and unfortunately asian-hate is within that realm.

"It seems pretty equivalent to my travel in Canada.  The further I get into a Canadian province, I am less likely to find a U.S. flag.  Beyond Waterton, possibly Banff I will likely not be able to find a U.S. flag.  

There may be certain places you can find it, but probably not worth your time to search.  If you can secure an address you will be near, you can deliver to it and pick it up on a specified day.  I have delivered to a hotel(not my residence) multiple times via Amazon or another service that provides a decent timeline.  

If you aren't a guest at a hotel you might be able to send it to a local post office where you can access it.  The pandemic has changed the accuracy in time in which some products are delivered though, so be aware of that.

I have loved time in Canada and hope I can visit again within the next year.  I hope you enjoy your time here and that you can see everything you want and have a great experience.

"If I could predict the market I'd be a billionaire, but there are a few things going for St. George that indicate it's in a good spot relative to other markets. 

1) Retirees will continue to flock here as homes in Salt Lake and other markets continue to rise to ridiculous prices.

2) Our proximity to California means we catch a lot of the demand as it moves east.

3) Families move here from Las Vegas.

4) The economy here is growing, with manufacturing coming to the east side of the county, more international traffic to the parks, vacation homes and short-term rentals going up near Hurricane, and the expansion of DSU into a polytech school.

"> St. George is a lousy rental market. There are few choices and even fewer good choices. To me that makes renting less attractive if you think you will be here for any length of time.

I agree with you here.  However let's remember that city planning policy is what is driving this.

"A couple things to consider:

* St. George is a lousy rental market. There are few choices and even fewer good choices. To me that makes renting less attractive if you think you will be here for any length of time.
* The area is still growing and there is a shortage of housing overall. In the 2007 crash prices went down but it was driven by speculative purchases and bad loans. This time around more of the purchases have been cash deals and more are owner occupied (I don't have a source handy but that's what I've read). That suggests that prices are unlikely to drop much even if there is a correction. More likely prices will just level out.

I don't have any special insight into the market, though, so *caveat emptor*.",t2_1trp,russross,0,1644162964.0,0,t1_hvtnbsh,hvtnbsh,True,gucchella,t3_slnnor,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/slnnor/to_buy_or_to_rent/,To buy or to rent?,/r/stgeorge/comments/slnnor/to_buy_or_to_rent/hvtnbsh/,3,r/stgeorge,0,3

"My wife and I are in the same boat! I would say there is never a better time than now to get in on home ownership, because there is no way to predict the market. To give you both sides of advice though,

"We moved to the area about 18 months ago (August 2020) and looked in all the areas mentioned. When we came to look we were 99% sure we wanted to be in Santa Clara or St. George proper. Budget wasn‚Äôt a concern, infact we didn‚Äôt know the price for most of the homes we looked at, which was intentional as we didn‚Äôt want that to sway our view. After looking at dozens of homes, we found an amazing brand new neighborhood in Hurricane out near Sand Hollow. Gorgeous views, nice and quiet, and our neighbors are amazing. We are absolutely not conservative, I wouldn‚Äôt say we‚Äôre liberal either, I‚Äôd just call us open minded and our neighbors are all largely the same way. It‚Äôs been nice. Our neighbors are mostly retired transplants (which worried us at first because we‚Äôre not near that age group at all) but we do have a handful of families that have lived in the area most their lives. 

Our son is from another country and I have to say we‚Äôve had more race related incidents in St George and Santa Clara than we have in Hurricane. I‚Äôd like to chalk it up to it being the older generation you get way more of in St George and Santa Clara but we‚Äôve seen it from all generations. That was one of our concerns when moving to the area, unfortunate but true. You do get a lot of Trump love in all of Southern Utah but certainly in Hurricane, in fact I bet a week doesn‚Äôt pass by that I still see a ‚ÄòTrump 2020‚Äô flag still flying on someone‚Äôs truck. Again, we‚Äôre open minded and as such let them have their opinions and beliefs. 

As mentioned, the food scene in Hurricane (and really all of Southern Utah) is embarrassingly sad. I think there‚Äôs a huge opportunity for someone to do a good casual non-chain restaurant in Hurricane. There‚Äôs tons of tourists coming through all the time either from the non-stop events at Sand Hollow or those going to and from Zions and other parks and locals all seem to be wanting more.

I did/do find it a bit comical when talking to locals that have been here their whole life and talking about going in to St George. They all act like it‚Äôs a full day activity because it‚Äôs sooo far. It takes us no more than 20 mins, sometimes much less, to get to down town St George. At first I was confused how everyone didn‚Äôt want to go ‚Äúall the way‚Äù in to St George. Coming from an area that had stores on every block and it still took at least 20 minutes to go anywhere, I found it entertaining. (I still get a chuckle any time someone talks about some place being ‚Äúfar‚Äù. )",t2_4iiif5cq,deleted_once,0,1642783152.0,0,t1_htm7xzt,htm7xzt,True,Historical-Walk-6327,t3_s6s6m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/stgeorge/comments/s6s6m8/honest_local_thoughts_on_hurricane/,Honest local thoughts on Hurricane?,/r/stgeorge/comments/s6s6m8/honest_local_thoughts_on_hurricane/htm7xzt/,2,r/stgeorge,0,2
"Yeah those events for us were really necessary.

"I live in Hurricane so I'll try to answer. 

>Just wondering, is Hurricane a good place for a family? Are the any restaurant opportunities or bars for my son to work in? Any good private schools? What is the culture of the town?

Yeah, I think it's probably great for a family. Low crime, lots of other families, good schools (or so I hear, I have no children). There are some restaurants in Hurricane, but not a lot. But St George isn't that far by car so he could commute. St George also has what few bars are in the area, unless you count the weird (usually empty) Eagles bar out here. Utah in general has weird alcohol laws and views, so if you're a drinker maybe look into that. Also our alcohol is weaker.

The culture is predominantly white and conservative although I can see it changing over time slowly. But liberals, leftist he'll even center people are probably the minority. We had lots of folks with lots of Trump flags making fools of themselves. 

>charging stations are sufficient for getting around southern Utah. 

I've seen one charging plug in all of Hurricane and it's a tiny thing in my apartment complex. If there are others I haven't noticed them. Walmart in Washington has some, and so do other businesses in STG. Springdale also has some, but that's up in front of Zion. I have no idea if that's enough for your needs, sorry. But short answer is that it's almost non existent out here.

It‚Äôs ofttimes moisture that comes in overnight when the temperature is lower and then it warms up during the day and melts.

"If you need 200 mbps, InfoWest isn't an option. I believe they go up to 100 in some locations, 50 in others. Besides that, they're honestly overpriced. 

TDS is honestly the best provider in town. Century Link is fine as a competitor, and at least keeps TDS prices down to stay competitive. 

I probably would compare the prices and specials of Century Link and TDS and decide based on that. My Dad switches between the two every 2 years or so to get better deals. They're both fine.

I use infowest at my work. It was AWI before they were bought out and they have consistently gone down hill. They will outsource there calls if they get more than a few at a time. Wind also affects my service. I hated CenturyLink and there terrible customer service. By far my last recommendation.

"I personally would never go with infowest. I prefer a hardline to my house, not a satellite on my roof pointing at a tower. Right now TDS is offering 300mbps for $65. I‚Äôm not an employee, I just recently upgraded. Outside of fiber, broadband internet is the best route. Also, but your own modem and router.
