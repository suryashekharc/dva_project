"I grew up shopping there as a kid and used to love it. Then I got to be in my 20s and realized that the owner was a total jerk. They hired people who were really rude to females who shopped there for video games. Even as a kid, people would make weird comments when I was trying to look at Atari games or whatever, and it was so annoying. I ""won"" a FB contest for a free shirt and was so excited, and then when I went to pick it up the owner was a total asshole and made some comment about how I didn't shop there enough to warrant winning it. Mind you, like I said, I had been going there my whole life because it was one of the few game stores in the area. So his comment was completely unfounded and just flat out rude. After that I quit shopping there entirely, which was around the same time the Sub burned down and his crackpot posts about it all blaming the firefighters came to light. Anyone who shopped in any of his stores regularly knew/knows it is a total firetrap. The ONLY time one of his stores was not a firetrap was when Cheap Thrills briefly moved into one of the buildings downtown. I was in there when the San Simeon EQ hit and everything was shaken completely off the walls and floors and they refused to sell me a CD and acted like I was crazy for asking. SO I went to Best Buy and bought it there instead.

"The accessory dwelling unit side of things makes a ton of sense, I guess I focused more on unlisted business numbers as it topped your list. More inventory is indeed a good thing!

As an aside, I wish I knew more about the local zoning rules etc. because I think a development of relatively hyper-dense, inexpensive rentals makes a ton of sense for SLO. In SF they built up some supposedly low-income condos like that intended to help people into ownership (I think they were zoned as SROs), but they were all immediately bought by young single tech workers who don't demand much in terms of square footage and couldn't afford SF's usual rents (perfect for working at a startup where one's paycheck might not be very FAANG-ey).

Putting the whole tech workers & SF politics angle aside, I think there would be a decent market for something like that in SLO. A  building of dense pack small apartments catering to young single people with communal bike storage & parking underneath, a wash rack for mountain bikes and other gear, access to walking/biking trails, and maybe stick it out of town a bit so things are cheaper (put in good windows and stick it out by Cuesta Equipment / the airport or something). Basically, really nice dorms.

For a lot of people that makes sense ‚Äî when I  was younger I would have loved an option like that. I suspect my friends in commercial real estate would immediately tell me why it's a bad idea, but it would fit the bill in terms of adding inventory and meeting the needs of many single folks who want to live in SLO vs. perhaps being okay with a larger place for the kids in A.G./Atascadero/Arizona/Idaho/etc.",t2_122tnc,TriTipMaster,0,1648935042.0,0,t1_i35jgdc,i35jgdc,False,grumpy_slo,t3_tt6w5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/tt6w5c/airbnb_violations_in_slo/,Airbnb violations in SLO,/r/SLO/comments/tt6w5c/airbnb_violations_in_slo/i35jgdc/,1,r/SLO,0,1

That article and reading about further restrictions the CC has passed since then took my dreams of operating a truck here away.

"Oh yeah; I have a daughter living in Portland, food pods and occasional food truck pod pop ups are all good- unfortunately, like SLO, Portland is discovering that a parking lot size area for food pods can be converted to a building for retail, office, housing, or combinations of those three.  They still have quite a selection depending on the area, but really nice to come across them nonetheless.  In reality though, I don't think there would be enough demand to keep a permanent food pod operating in the black due to factors like lack of parking or an available set up space with heavy foot traffic .

"I‚Äôm GLBT and was born and raised in Los Osos (I moved to the bay area for a number of years, but returned to be near family).

I have a GLBT couple next door, a couple directly across the street, and a family around the block.  The local bookstore, Volumes of Pleasure, has been GLBT owned for decades.  But there is no GLBT community in Los Osos or the other coastal communities.

For the most part, SLO county is ok with glbt people that don‚Äôt make a big thing about being gay, but I wouldn‚Äôt live in north county if you could avoid it.  Most everyone ok with us existing.  But not if we ‚Äúflaunt‚Äù it.

I‚Äôve been called gay slurs, but not in the coastal communities from Cambria to Los Osos.

We have GALA in SLO and if they are your kind of people, you will find community.  If they are not, there‚Äôs not much else here GLBT community wise.  I‚Äôm more on the Queer side of things and there‚Äôs nothing here for me.

From 2003 to 2006 I had my car with 3 gay bumper stickers vandalized more times then I can remember.  Tires slashed, nails put in my spare tire, my whole car paintballed, cottage cheese and pickles thrown on my car, bumper stickers slashed/torn off/ drawn on, anti gay/religious stickers applied to my vehicle, back window smashed, got keyed a few times, and nasty notes left on my windshield to top it off.  I don‚Äôt have anything gay in or on my car anymore, so I don‚Äôt know if this kinda thing would still happen, but I won‚Äôt chance it because it gets expensive (the cottage cheese ruined my paint job) and the overall attitude toward GLBT people hasn‚Äôt improved noticeably since then.

I don‚Äôt want you to misinterpret this.  I don‚Äôt know of any violent anti-gay hate crimes that have happened in SLO county.  The schools are becoming more accepting with glbt groups and a few local churches fly a pride flag.

My partner and I (both gender queer people that looked like a lesbian couple until recently) take care of my nieces and frequently have people telling us how adorable our kids are.  People assume we‚Äôre a gay family and interact with us like we‚Äôre just another hetero couple.

My nieces (6-10 years old) have friends that have gay parents and friends that identify as GLBT and it‚Äôs normal for them.

I am a visibly gender-queer person and I feel safe walking around holding my partners hand 99% of the time (I don‚Äôt go to Passo).  I do get stares and children occasionally ask me questions (are you a girl or boy?), but I generally don‚Äôt run into people that are openly hostile towards me for existing.

If your serious about moving here, I‚Äôd check out GALA and see if they are your kind of people.  A lot of stuff has been online since the pandemic, so you should be able to attend online stuff before moving here.",t2_6giyzfza,Birdseye_Speedwell,0,1648688442.0,0,t1_i2sfwoa,i2sfwoa,True,ego_brain,t3_td15qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/td15qy/gay_families/,Gay families?,/r/SLO/comments/td15qy/gay_families/i2sfwoa/,1,r/SLO,0,1

If your teeth are below the gumline or mostly below the gumline then you'll probably need to see the OMFS.

"I went to Johnson Family Dental in SLO near Rite Aid/Carls Jr. for mine, had Blue Shield also. My wisdom teeth were only partially breaking through my gums and it was causing food to get stuck, and my gums were becoming infected. I didn't have a ton of time to shop around and check out my options.

Honestly I did not have a good experience there and would not recommend. I have no way to prove it really but I am almost certain they permanently damaged my jaw. Sorry I don't have an alternative place to recommend, just wanted to give you a heads up about where I had mine done. They were a fine place to go for teeth cleaning or simple procedures, but not that. They had two different dentists while I was there and I did not like either of them very much. The dentist who removed my wisdom teeth was an old gentleman, and they are not allowed to put you under there, so you will be awake the whole time.

I also had some cavities filled there, and my current dentist had to fix them (shave them down to fit my teeth better) and re-do some. Also, one of the cavities they did fix, the filling only lasted a couple months. They wanted me to pay for them to fix it again, but I had to fight them on that and they eventually agreed to just fix it since it did not last long at all???",t2_nrx56,gameofcats,0,1648503901.0,0,t1_i2hnkq8,i2hnkq8,True,pisser60,t3_tqcwa2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/tqcwa2/wisdom_teeth_removal_slo_city/,wisdom teeth removal SLO city,/r/SLO/comments/tqcwa2/wisdom_teeth_removal_slo_city/i2hnkq8/,2,r/SLO,0,2

It's not illegal for cyclists to ride side by side. Just wait for a safe moment to pass and you'll be ok!

"Most of the important points have been covered here, so I don't have too much to add. Road riding here is incredible, especially if you're used to dodging cars in OC. Basically every single road in the county either has a bike lane, shoulder, or doesn't see enough traffic to worry about riding and there's a huge diversity of terrain. Lots of wind and rolling roads, so get ready to get strong, it's pretty consistently 1k of climbing per 10 miles. 

Heading up the coast gets you some jaw-dropping views (check out old creek road, Santa Rosa Creek road, highway 41 & 46 (I only ride those east to west, the shoulders suck on the west side), and Santa Rita creek and cypress mountain if you want some gravel to spice it up), going over the grade (huge rideable shoulders along 101, get off at Santa Margarita, take the shortcut thru the gate before the bridge when heading south) gets you awesome loops through Creston, huer huero, Santa Margarita, pozo, black mountain is an insane climb with awful roads, but it's gorgeous (it gets crazy hot in summer in north country, there's places to get water at the park in Santa Margarita and the fire station in pozo), going south gets you Lopez lake and hi mountain road (don't go on the dirt section on a road bike), the boot loop through arroyo grande, Santa Maria, plus loads of short punchy climbs in arroyo grande (check out the ""hill ride"" Strava segment). 

If you're into mountain biking, it's literally world class here. Chris Blevins, current XC short course world champion and Olympian trained here for the last 4 years while going to Poly, so it's at least good enough for him. Poly canyon, Cuesta ridge, pismo preserve, Madonna mtn, Johnson Ranch/ Irish hills, and of course Montana de Oro are all exceptional places to ride plus a million more. If gravel biking is more your speed, there's not a lot of fire roads, so as long as you're okay on green circle and blue square MTB trails you'll be fine. 

For routes, check out the Cal Poly cycling website for a few basic ones, but Strava is your best bet. The rec I always give is to check out the CP cycling Strava club and look at public rides that people in the club go on. It's spring break rn, so less local rides until next week, but it's a great place to see where people actually ride. Also most of the Voler factory racing team guys train around here, so check some of them out. 

Sadly very few group rides around here. I think all that's going on right now is the Thursday night hammer ride (~20-21mph), they leave from Art's at 5:30, I think that started back up a week or 2 ago. It's a hammer ride, but there's 4 sprints where they regroup after, super fun group, usual etiquette there - don't roll up if you don't know what you're doing or else you'll get yelled at. There's been Tuesday night drop race pace rides and Sunday morning practice crits in the past, but I don't think any of that's on rn. 

The two major clubs in the area atm are Heritage cycling club, and vivid cycling club. Heritage is mostly older guys, VCC is (mostly) younger, and races some -mostly cat 3- and puts on some rides. Check out their websites/socials if you're interested.

Kin is great, I love going there. 

Student leases basically all start in June/July, so that when all the move-ins are happening.

"Former employee here. Harris is a nut job, but I thought this place would be an interesting job (and I've met my share of crazy business owners). 

After organizing DVDs and Blu-ray's, my hands would be *black* with dust. And he would NEVER get rid of any DVDs or Blu-ray. That whole section full of racks is at 99.8% capacity, and he buys another 80 blu-rays for us to somehow put on the floor? 

Ferris buys anything that's wholesale, like  video stores' closing sales, blowouts, you name it, and shoves it in this dusty over-stacked closet he calls a store.

It rained *non-stop* during December, and it really pushed the integrity of the building to the max. Gushing -I mean *gushing*- waterflow was coming out of the same walls electrical wires came from. Rainwater oozed into multiple sections of the store, and they had me patting the moist carpet with paper towels... 

Nevertheless, I got COVID and they blamed it on me and my family, and refused to pay for my tests because *I* single handedly brought COVID to the workplace according to them. Which is false, and they have no way of proving that. I left shortly after, to say the least.

"Former employee here. I worked at one of their warehouses, which was absolutely another fire hazard, and a health hazard. One time the rain was leaking from the ceiling onto the inventory shelves, so they put a moldy tarp over one shelf and told me to get under the tarp to get products. There was literally no way for me to hold up the tarp, and get to all the shelves I needed to get to, without the mold touching me. It was not just a ‚Äúlittle‚Äù moldy either, it was definitely a health hazard. 

My interview was also just Rick‚Äôs 2 hour rant about the government, and it had almost nothing to do with my resume. I should‚Äôve seen the red flags then, but I just really needed a job. 

& For the record, Richard‚Äôs daughter is not a good boss either. There were so many times that I found out from other employees that she was talking bad about me behind my back. I was an efficient and fast worker, but she‚Äôd complain about the pettiest things that I can‚Äôt put here, out of literal fear that they‚Äôd know who I am. I also found out she‚Äôd talk about how I should get together with one of the other employees there- a thought that made me very uncomfortable. (All of this is just to further explain how unprofessional that workplace is.) 

Also I was sexually harassed there and didn‚Äôt do anything about it- because I was naive. One of the older employees, about 40 years older than me, would talk about how we wanted to kiss me. Not ok. That wasn‚Äôt even close to the worst part of the job there though.

"I have actually never had a bad experience there. When games people play, foghorn and boo boo shrunk their presence; it kinda became the spot to get comics, dnd stuff and like old receivers, albums and games in one spot. It's always been the weird kitchy junk shop in town to me. 

They were pretty helpful, had good dice sets and models, and even helped me special order to complete obscure comic collections. Prices weren't like astoundingly fair or outrageous, but yknow, you're buying local, so it felt better.

"Haha! I applied for a job at Cheap Thrills a few years ago. The application itself was extremely arduous. I distinctly remember there being a math section where you had to do long subtraction/addition/multiplication without a calculator to show that you could handle the math of cash transactions. IN THE APPLICATION

Once I finished my app and turned it in, I was emailed to come into the store and complete a ""music questionnaire"" in lieu of an interview. It was the craziest shit I'd ever seen. They'd list a person's name, and you were expected to name the band that that person was in. It's one thing to put John Lennon or Freddie Mercury on there, but they put really obscure names that most wouldn't know, like the name of the drummer from a minimally popular Ska band 30 years ago, or the bass player from a one-hit 80s synth-pop group. Really crazy shit. There were 5 pages to this test, each page with like 20-30 random names. I got maybe 50% of them, but I still didn't get enough of them to get a call back. Turns out it was a blessing in disguise. Your post says a lot, but I can't say it's the first time I've heard these kinds of claims about Richard Ferris' stores.

">The median home price in San Luis Obispo County was $829,000 in February, according to Realtor.com, which was up about 11.1% year-over-year. SLO County also had one of the higher per capita personal income averages at $62,342, of the 205 small metros studied.

829k. 829,000 fucking dollars is cheaper than half the homes in the county. So if the average person wants a 20 year home loan for the middle priced house, (and it's probably going to be a 900k loan after interest and taxes/fees) then you have to spend 45k per year on your mortgage alone. That leaves you with barely more than 17 grand per year or about 1450 a month to spend on everything else such as food, property and sales taxes, gas and utility bills. Good luck raising a family on that. Of course in practice you'll never, ever get that kind of loan approved anyway so it's a moot point.

Absolutely not. For several reasons. I don't think it is an effective form of expression for the valid frustration, and of course even if I was in favor of blocking the freeway there is no way in hell I would take my kids to do that.

>If so, how does that jibe with your comments about placing the cop's child at risk of physical harm?

It jibes because I would not put my children in that situation.

>Why would you think said child would be at any risk from peaceful BLM protestors?

Because I don't know all of the protestors and all of the cops on both sides of the encounter. It is an inherently unpredictable situation. That said, I went to a couple of these protests in our area and I saw no signs that either protestors or cops intended to be anything but peaceful.",t2_1p94f,tiktaalink,0,1647905006.0,0,t1_i1lf3oy,i1lf3oy,False,BlankVerse,t3_tis7p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/tis7p2/this_california_wine_country_town_is/,This California wine country town is multicultural.

"Two moments stand out to me from when I went to a BLM protest in Paso. The ugliest and most relevant to this discussion is the blockade of the street as the marchers approached the freeway. The police were not provocative or overtly racist in behavior but it was telling that a young man of no more than 13-14 years of age was in that blockade. I assume it was a son of one of the officers.

I wonder what the conversations were like in that household? As a parent myself, I was very concerned for my teenage children who were with me. I coached them to be near the sidewalk in case a car drove through the protest. When we were stopped I wrangled them to the side so that we could more easily step out of harms way at the blockade. In the family of the child who was in the blockade, they apparently encouraged or condoned the intent of that young man to be at the focal point of conflict. I can't imagine wanting that for your child. 

Apparently the tradition that is important for many Paso parents to uphold is that of denying or ignoring the historical and current injustices that characterize white society's approach to race relations. So much so that they are willing to put their children's education and even physical well being at risk. 

In another episode a local officer was instructing personnel from the company I work for how to deal with an active shooter. This officer made the claim that the nut job that shot Paso police was a BLM activist. 

Even if this is true, the evidence is overwhelming that the offender in that shooting was someone with severe mental health issues, and these issues were the proximal cause of his activities. Instead of having an honest discussion, we were treated to a healthy portion of what my friend calls copaganda depicting dissent against police as an inherently violent, anarchic and anti-social activity.

As far as we've come as a nation from the worst episodes in our history, it is still clear we have so far to go.",t2_1p94f,tiktaalink,0,1647867404.0,0,t1_i1iwk8w,i1iwk8w,True,BlankVerse,t3_tis7p2,https://www.reddit.com/r/SLO/comments/tis7p2/this_california_wine_country_town_is/,This California wine country town is multicultural.

"You literally said ""I don't think about Bi as being unique or different in the same way that I think of L/G"" which is textbook bi erasure dude. We face significant though different problems than our L/G and straight peers

Like, as per https://ncadv.org/blog/posts/domestic-violence-and-the-lgbtq-community

> 43.8% of lesbian women and 61.1% of bisexual women have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner at some point in their lifetime, as opposed to 35% of heterosexual women.

> 26% of gay men and 37.3% of bisexual men have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime, in comparison to 29% of heterosexual men.

I think the fact that we have *significantly higher* rates of being victims of sexual assault and intimate partner violence compared to other sexual orientations is *maybe* relevant to conversations. Erasing our existence does nothing to help us address *why* that is

You insulting me to my face for my identity and then saying I'm wrong for being upset about it? Like, come on dude.
