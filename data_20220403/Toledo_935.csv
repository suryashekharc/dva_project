"Lead paint is possible in anything built before 1978. Water is treated with chemicals that bond and coat lead to keep it out of the drinking water. Lead solder was used on copper fittings until 1984. Straight up lead water lines are possible but unlikely. Asbestos is likely in any large building from the era in which it was used, but that doesn’t mean there would be much/any exposure to it for a resident. More likely a concern for the plumber that has to do a repair in a mechanical area of the building. Any old building is going to have these things going on, but that doesn’t mean that you will be exposed to hazardous levels living there.  If you have zero tolerance for living in a building where these  hazards are present then you ve got to live in newer building.

Edit: btw it is essentially impossible to have a zero tolerance policy on no lead in a water line system. It was only 2014 when the standard became “lead free” brass which still has like .0025 percent lead in it. So there is lead in the brass alloy body of every single faucet in America, except maybe the $14 Walmart plastic faucets that leak from day 1. Also there is leaded solder and brass in the municipal system that gets the water to your residence.

This kid is incredibly funny and I can totally understand why you would want to share the things you enjoy with another human being obviously. I also told him if he does happen to find another kiddo at school that mentions they like Adventure Time as well, that he can almost bet they would make great friends.

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Yes, I would have to agree with that. I don't really see the need of that median at all. And it still seems like visual interference between drivers and pedestrians.

Now that I see that website, narrower street makes more sense to me. I'm not trying to under value the difficulty of design. Putting in bike lanes,.. could take a street from 4 lanes to two. I think that works with turn lanes to keep traffic moving but I'm not sure how turn lanes work with bike lanes, lol.

"An example of a bold stroke would have been rebuilding Summit Street with a full intensive [complete street](https://smartgrowthamerica.org/what-are-complete-streets/) approach. Complete streets focus on safety and making streets work for all people, not just cars. It seems like the only updates made to Summit Street that improve the street for non-car users is the addition of “the Oval” pedestrian island (under the previous location of a now demolished skywalk) and the bump out of sidewalks over the removed bus lanes at a few crossings to reduce crossing distance (removal of bus lanes, the transit implications that has, and TARTA routes/funding being a whole other issue). Aside from “sharing the road” bicycles are given no space on Summit Street. In a response to this I had seen it explained that  wasn’t needed because the future Glass City Riverwalk would provide the needed bike infrastructure, and the Glass City Riverwalk will be great, but it is something entirely separate from allowing bikes to be able to safely access Summit Street itself. I would also love for Toledo, especially the downtown area - located right on the Maumee just upstream from Lake Erie an within reach of algal blooms - to start putting in green stormwater infrastructure to showcase and put emphasis on the importance of water stewardship right there in the core of the region. Green stormwater infrastructure is another thing that can be integrated into a complete street as well and functions as landscaping features aesthetically. 
Summit Street just very much feels functionally the same as what it was before, and I just don’t know that most people would be able to say that their experience with Summit Street has been improved aside from the fresh pavement (and I am very open to hearing denials or confirmations of this from people who work or live downtown and use it much more often than I do).
I know that there are restrictions on what can be done to Summit Street with it being a state route, and obviously there is only so much space available. But it feels like the status quo had been established Summit Street is a primary artery for car traffic through downtown and it was decided that the status quo must be maintained. At the same time, if the stated goals are to make downtown more walkable, accessible, enjoyable, liveable, and vibrant, that car-centric status quo on the signature street connecting the downtown core with the waterfront, activities, venues and restaurants, is at odds with that goal and something has to give.",t2_9begzp6n,tolwat,0,1648574972.0,0,t1_i2l8nkp,i2l8nkp,False,Ponch47,t3_tkicpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tkicpd/reflective_sculpture_going_up_in_downtown_toledo/,Reflective sculpture going up in downtown Toledo on Summit Street,/r/toledo/comments/tkicpd/reflective_sculpture_going_up_in_downtown_toledo/i2l8nkp/,2,r/toledo,0,2

I say this because 15/hr isn't going to do much for you if you end up quitting or getting shiitcanned because you took up work you can't keep up with. So it helps to have at least a general idea of what you can do and where you're going (though people are likely to give you some leeway for being that young).

The University campus has some nice small art that makes walking a bit more fun. I like the old guy on the bench and there's some sort of eco pond near the tail gaiting lot which is cool.

"Thanks! For all that.

That Monroe street section is hard to cross. I appreciate that island. There wasn't a light ther before, was there? Anyhow, always seemed like I was running to get across before the big smoosh.

Never had a problem with Summit. Lights every block, I think it was easier to just get across without the stop. It looks .... OK, but not a game changer by any means. I like the stuff they did on the sidewalks though.

TBH, I'm tired of ""industrial"" though. I posted this on another reddit they were discussing  remodel done industrial to reflect ""past,"" got a lot of agreement. Don't care at all for the COSI or hotel remodel. Are there really a lot of old factory workers looking to stay in something that reminds them of the factory?

It's on Summit Street between Madison and Adams (could also say on Summit Street between Promenade Park and Imagination Station). [This image is a rendering of the oval from before the project started.](https://www.toledoblade.com/image/2019/11/13/1140x_a10-7_cTC/Summit-St-Rendering.jpg) The Summit Street reconstruction, that ""the Oval"" was a part of involved median work (there were some medians on Summit Street already) changes to the configuration of travel lanes (there used to be a bus lane), and changes to as street parking, as well as relocation of utilities and probably several other incidental items. It was very much billed as a project to impress golfers and visitors for the Solheim Cup, but the impact that the new streetscape actually had on any visitors is absolutely a matter that is up for debate. The issues with the lawsuits and Federal investigation are tied to the City paying to relocate Buckeye Cable utilities while other utilities paid the City to relocate their utilities as I discussed in my first response. Honestly it is very confusing, and as I said I don't think it has been resolved yet.

There is pedestrian island as you are mentioned on Monroe Street between the Toledo Museum of Art and the Glass Pavilion, but that is something separate. That pedestrian island is probably about half the width of ""the Oval"" on Summit Street and is only intended to shorten the crossing distance from 4 travel lanes at once to 2 travel lanes 2 times. I agree that the narrowness of that pedestrian island could itself pose safety issues when needing to wait in it while crossing, however I will disagree with the idea that Monroe Street there is never hard to cross - because Monroe Street is rarely busy on that stretch drivers can easily feel like they are on an open road and blast through that stretch going well over the speed limit. Crossing 4 lanes of intermittent traffic moving at widely varying speeds is not always an easy task, yes there are times with long intervals with no cars, but at other times there are steady flows of cars spaced just close enough to each other to prevent you from crossing and at speeds that are difficult to judge. Crossings like this can especially a concern for those who may have mobility issues and might not be able to just jog across a street quickly in the gaps of traffic. Note both of these islands are located at road crossings without signals, which is a major driver behind these pedestrian islands being there.

While ""the Oval"" is twice as wide as the Monroe Street Art Museum pedestrian island, I still don't think people would choose to hang out there in between 4 lanes of traffic. It just feels like they are trying to force something to happen there that will never take.",t2_9begzp6n,tolwat,0,1648318871.0,0,t1_i27xyxz,i27xyxz,False,Ponch47,t3_tkicpd,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tkicpd/reflective_sculpture_going_up_in_downtown_toledo/,Reflective sculpture going up in downtown Toledo on Summit Street,/r/toledo/comments/tkicpd/reflective_sculpture_going_up_in_downtown_toledo/i27xyxz/,2,r/toledo,0,2

"I'm not sure if you're saying ""yes?""  Promedica, I thought that was down by the water. I didn't know anything about the Y. Maybe that's why I'm not following.

I'm not in the know here, just trying to understand the conversation in order to understand what ""The Oval"" is. I don't see anything ""oval"" on, off or near Summit St. Not trying to be obtuse, I just don't follow.

As I recall it, only having news to go by, there was Summit St development down by the Old Fort where Boody House was, really cool area. Then there was suddenly this very expensive added median which is, just a median.  But they were playing it up as if it was a difference maker that was going to impress the golfers. And it is I think what led to a bunch of lawsuits about cables,

If it's what I'm thinking of, I cant see why it would get any special name like ""The Oval,"" so I'm thinking ""The Oval"" is something other than what I have in my head. 

What I have in my head is around the museum. I don't see any reason for pedestrians to hang around it, there's no room to sit and barely enough to stand to cross the next two lanes. Would be better to just let them cross the entire street where no one is trying to control kids between streams of traffic. It's just a median for a never particularly hard road to cross.

Since she loves THAT specific Toledo moussaka so much, I figured there'd be some peculiar wrinkle to it, that sets it apart.  But nope.

"I-75 will get you to and from downtown Toledo is 25ish minutes depending how close to live to the highway, but if there is construction it could take way long. If you're taking back/side roads it may take 45-60 minutes depending on traffic and where you're located in Toledo.

You could always split the difference and live in between like some others have suggested, unless you're wanting to be very close to the fun stuff. Places like Temperance is on the border of MI/OH or you could go North to somewhere like Belleville which is between Ann Arbor/Monroe (probably 20-30 minutes to get to either) and somewhat closer to Detroit even.

Unfortunately, if you're wanting to be right next to the bars/clubs/parties you will likely have to commute a ways to Monroe.

"I'm from the Toledo area and lived in Monroe for a few years, back in Toledo area. 

I'm assuming that you're working at the actual hospital in town, on Macomb. Personally, I think it's easier to get there from I75 than it is through town. Monroe is set up slightly strange where there's no real good way of getting through it without hitting a bunch of lights. 

Monroe isn't bad. In my opinion, it isn't great. There's a lot of stores. And a lot of food options, but not much to do. Toledo and Detroit are going to have the 'activities' Plus if you like going to State\county Parks you either have to buy a rec pass, or pay to get in every time. 

Point Place is great. So are parts of Toledo. That's if you don't mind dealing with out of state taxes every year. 
Toledo area has an amazing amount of metro parks that are all free to get into. Toledo has ALL the food and has a minor baseball\hockey team and occasionally has some decent concerts.

Like others said, Lambertville\Temperance are close to the State Line, but have quick access into Monroe, but still really close to Toledo. Small towns though. 

I wouldn't consider going West.

"Closer to Toledo makes more sense since any transfer in side Promedica will probably be to Toledo where most of their facilities are.

Cheaper places than Temperance are Erie and Luna Pier, but Temperance has all the amenities and would be my first choice. I'd also look at Point Place in Toledo, good access to I75 and an old quirky place with personality. 

Toledo is a surprise in many ways, with a world class art museum and zoo, surprisingly both better than Detroit's. It's Little Detroit in all ways, including the good ones.

Monroe itself is pricey to live in, but despite several severe economic blows in the last 20 years, has weathered everything and continues to grow.

The owners of the Westgate Village Shopping Center plan to purchase the vacant Sears building and redevelop the property, the company’s CEO told The Blade. 

Liz Holland, the CEO of Chicago-based Abbell Credit Corporation, which owns the Westgate plaza, said the vacant building would be razed and plans would be evaluated to determine a redevelopment proposal for that site.

“We’ve been their neighbor since 1956 and we feel like we are probably in the best position to redevelop it,” 

The company already owns the parking lot that wraps around the building, she added.

 

“It made the most sense for us to be the logical buyer,” Ms. Holland said.

The purchase price will not be disclosed until the sale is finalized.

There are no plans to purchase the vacant Elder-Beerman building, which sits adjacent to the Sears building, she said.",t2_1yl01e3,Ponch47,0,1648047091.0,0,t1_i1sv0q1,i1sv0q1,True,Ponch47,t3_tkvmk6,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tkvmk6/vacant_sears_store_at_westgate_could_see_new_life/,Vacant Sears store at Westgate could see new life,/r/toledo/comments/tkvmk6/vacant_sears_store_at_westgate_could_see_new_life/i1sv0q1/,13,r/toledo,0,13

"Yeah, I felt like the Summit Street reconstruction project was such a wasted great opportunity for the city to make a statement on its showpiece street about shifting the paradigm and making downtown a place for people. But instead they just put down shiny new pavement and effectively said that the status quo will be maintained and the most important thing to focus on is allowing cars to drive through our showpiece street as quickly as possible. There are definitely improvements being made, but none of them feel like the bold statements that need to be made (I know there is a lot of pushback to that but I still think bold strokes are needed) and I don’t really see a systematic approach being used (or at least communicated), it just feels like things are put down in isolated haphazard pockets that aren’t too useful by themselves.

"Thank you for this! Most of it is exactly what I thought. But, I had completely forgotten that I have a medical exemption that I had turned in at the beginning of January because I was in and out of the hospital and have been using these exemptions since I initially got really sick and started struggling financially from spending weeks at a time hospitalized. I suffer from onset heart failure and a few types of Dysautonomia. 

I know that they just started being able to do disconnections in October after Covid. So I’m wondering if they are just trying to get as much money as possible because of the effects of that. I would imagine some people just defaulted if evicted or losing their homes also. Back in October actually I had a woman come to my door specifically to give me a 10 notice telling me I had to pay on due date and that now they can start disconnecting again. She was trying to bully me into paying right then with her. I will admit that I was two months behind. I have been on Auto-Pay since then. This month I couldn’t pay exactly on due date. But, it was only 12 days late. And I received no prior notice. Could not pay with debit or credit, and suddenly added on an extra $124 on top of reconnecting fee.

"Definitely not more to the story. Wish I could say their was. I’m not ashamed to admit I’m a poor single mom and have had past due bills. Honestly the $197 is one of the lowest bills for electric I’ve even had. Usually my bill is around $250 a month. But in the past anytime I have had a disconnect notice, the first put a 10 day notice in my door or mailbox. And the one time I did have a shut off, my bill was almost $600. Also there wasn’t an extra $124. Another difference is that when I went to pay for it, I couldn’t use credit or debit. I had to give banking/routing #. That was my only option for payment method.

There are not very many businesses on summit street that would warrant someone sitting down in the middle of it to eat or hang out, especially with Promenade and Levis right there, like you said.

"Question: has anyone ever seen a single person hanging out in “the Oval”? The renderings show people eating at picnic tables there, and I feel like it was marketed as being a nice place to hang out, but I cannot see how anyone would find that small island in between 4 lanes of traffic an enjoyable place to be, especially with Promenade Park and Levis Square right there. I’m 100% in favor of the slight traffic calming that the Oval provides by shifting the alignment of the road, and the pedestrian safety it affords by cutting down travel lanes to cross from 4 to 2, but it still feels like a bit of a boondoggle to try to distract from the fact that Summit Street is still 4 lanes wide and will still feel like a pedestrian barrier between downtown and the river (I mean thank goodness it didn’t become a highway, but still).

"Maumee has some really cool suburbs right off of Airport Highway(more of a big main road than a highway). Runs right through Maumee with tons of food and shopping alongside it. Definitely nicer than parts of Toledo and only a 20 minute drive to Toledo (even shorter if you use tolls). That goes for any of the surrounding towns: Perrysburg, Maumee, Ottawa Hills, and Oregon(basically is Toledo still). 
Idk about selling potential, but with cities like Nashville, Pitt, Denver (Tol is not as big as those) slowly becoming transient shitty places, Toledo may be a place to buy and stay for a while until it gets engulfed by transplants like other cities have, then sell once cost of living goes through the roof. 
Toledo's great, the towns around it have just as much to offer  just without highrise buildings and you can always travel 15-20minutes into the city from ANY of these towns to catch a Mud Hens(minor MLB), Walleye(minor NHL), or a Rockets(college football) game. Huntington Center hosts pretty much every artist unless they're huge, then you just gotta take a short little trip up to Detroit.

"The metal itself should have no difference, but there are slight functional differences. When using cast iron you'll want to ""season"" the pan which is a process of cooking it with a thin layer of oil that will build up overtime and help create a non-stick surface. When they used to cast pans back in they day they would use ultra fine sand and pour the iron in so the surface is smooth to the touch and the eye. Some of the boutique producers today will use ultra fine sand in the production or they will grind the surface smooth. Lodge, which is pretty much the budget brand for cast iron, used larger grain sand and often the cooking surface will be textured. You can still get that non-stick effect on the pan, but in my experience it take a much longer period of time to do so. 

The boutique brands can be expensive with some new pans being more expensive than vintage.

Also many vintage brands no longer exist so it's cool to have a piece of history and some of the pan sizes they used to produce I can't find from any modern producers. I just got a 14 inch cast iron skillet the other day and the largest I've found from modern producers was like 12.5 inches. 

Regardless, any cast iron you buy today will treat you well if you take care of it the right way. Also, the metal is a great at retaining heat and can keep your food warm longer after cooking. If you want more info r/castiron is a great community. 

Some brands new and old did have various ways to reduce the weight of the pans. I've read Stargazer is a really good modern ""lightweight"" pan.",t2_9tydc,MollyWompus,0,1647793046.0,0,t1_i1f2gcs,i1f2gcs,False,MollyWompus,t3_tgtzva,https://www.reddit.com/r/toledo/comments/tgtzva/best_places_to_look_for_vintage_cast_iron/,Best places to look for vintage cast iron?,/r/toledo/comments/tgtzva/best_places_to_look_for_vintage_cast_iron/i1f2gcs/,3,r/toledo,0,3
"Our public transport is FREE and it's not being used. 

Insult our concerns of more investment as ""low hanging fruit"" if that's you.  The actual facts in this country are, people would rather sit hours in their car than take our version of mass transit. People do not trust the government, certainly not TARTA, particularly after that big build and high Administrative costs (which taxpayers will always assume true), to create a desirable mass transit system. Taxayers simply are not going to trust that the people pushing this are not looking to self-enrich when even FREE, the system isn't desirable.

Forcing people to pay even more of their paycheck into something they do not see purpose, do not enjoy and insulting their reasons is not going to gain supporters for your movement, no matter HOW much sense it makes to YOU.

As a polite suggestion to a person who prefered to insult, maybe YOU can donate YOUR money to TARTA to help pay for those that struggle to pay the boarding fee or maybe smarter, start a non-profit for that purpose so others can get a tax break for helping.
