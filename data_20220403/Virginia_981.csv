"Historically I have moved (overseas) every few years and I (too) used a UPS Store box as a mailing (only) address.  It worked for a very long time until it didn't.  Someone in the Virginia Department of Elections decided my use of a UPS box violated the rules -- it was considered a ""commercial address"" -- and I had to adjust my voter registration information to comply.  The notification that the UPS box was not acceptable was mailed to my old address and it didn't arrive particularly quickly, which caused some difficulty getting a ballot for a primary election ([https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincodefull/title1/agency20/chapter40](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/admincodefull/title1/agency20/chapter40)).   My suggestion would be to call the elections office of whatever county in which you are registered to inquire.  It helps if you know your voter registration number, in the past paper voter registrations cards were sent to us by mail.  In my case it took weeks to straighten everything out but I managed to get a ballot and vote.  According to press reports, the Youngkin Administration has begun to look at the Virginia's ""aging voting data systems"" and social media reports suggest that behind the scenes it is moving quickly to purchase its favorite ""brand"" of equipment.

"For emergencies like your mother getting cancer, you could submit the application to a vote by the public.  Very easy.

Drafting bills is too complex at the moment.  They need to have zero pork.  And so every bill should get an individual vote. No more combining unpopular bills with popular ones.  Votes can be tallied remotely and at the convenience of the representative.  Votes are always in session!

Districts are forever lost when you vote for compromise.  There should be no compromise with unpopular bills and popular ones.  If the bill is popular in NY, that’s what state government is for!  Keep federal out of it!

Value of government services… that’s what NY is for!  You don’t need to trample on people 3,000 miles away from you just because you want to abort a baby 28 days after birth!  And you don’t need to steal from people 3,000 miles from you if you want a socialist model!  Steal from NY!  Not from me.  (NY is used as an example). It’s not my job to determine what can be valuable to you, but the 90% of people who don’t want to participate in your social program in NY feel better off participating in their social programs in MD.

Prove it?  If you are “calling the government” for a handout, you are calling for more than $15 of benefits.  If you spend an hour with that person on the phone, you’ve now cost the government thousands of dollars in your benefit payouts.  That’s more than the $15 it costs to pay the phone agent.

">You are being silly. Why would they be bribed if all their assets are frozen?

I had $100,000 in USD before I entered Congress. It's currently frozen, a life emergency comes up such as my mother getting cancer & needing expensive medical treatment. I now need access to $100,000+ in cash. 

Because my assets are frozen (& hence I can't use that $100,000) it's more likely that if some rich person generously paid for my mother's medical expenses that I would do what they said. 

This type of thing is what they look for on security investigations, a lack of assets & huge debts make you vulnerable to being bribed. 

>You are assuming Congress can’t do work from home.

>They only need to read bills and sign them.

They need to draft bills as well. Said drafting requires them to hear testimony & collaboratively determine what Amendments pass or fail.

Additionally the folks on the national security committees who oversee the CIA, NSA, DoD etc all have to meet in secure areas to be brief about the top secret work these agencies are doing. Even with end to end encryption when your threat model is a nation state attack you cannot be sure that the Representatives house hasn't been bugged without doing costly sweeps. 

>They would be better off building rapport with people in their districts rather than other politicians.

That's up to them as elected representatives. If based on their experience as being an elected representative they determine the best use of their time is to talk to other representatives that's on them. Being able to know what other representatives want & hence being able to pass bills your district needs seems pretty important. 

>For websites, you are assuming that the government provides some sort of service to people. They don’t provide any valuable services. 

You aren't God & you don't get to determine what is & isn't a valuable service to other Americans. I enjoy plenty of useful services delivered to me through government websites & if I didn't have access to said services it would have been much harder to attend college & get a well paying job. 

You have to learn some humility here & recognize that your definition of value isn't going to be shared across all of society & it's very pompous of you to determine what is & isn't a valuable service to me. 

> What does a government need any websites for if it shouldn’t be taking any telephone calls either?

Again, who made you God? We as an American people have collectively decided that the government should be accessible through the Internet & via the phone. 

>On wasting money on people operating phones… it wastes more money answering phone calls or having websites than it does having a call center.

Prove it. 

>On the government not knowing how to do something cheaply… now we are getting somewhere with you! **Every single thing** the government currently does can be done better in the private sector. Leave it to them. There exists nothing cheap on government projects!

Again no. The private sector cannot provide military defense, air space management, food inspection, environmental regulation, drug regulation, & consumer protections to name a few because those things aren't profitable in nature & the profit nature of companies means they won't self regulate. 

>On DNA similarity.. you aren’t even trying to see my point of view here. You are simply being contrary because you feel you have to oppose me. Do I have to answer this one in better detail?

Yes you do because you could be meaning 17th cousins or immediate nuclear family & it's entirely unclear what the hell you mean. 

>If all this can be accomplished, America will truly be great. Anything short of this and we will be forever wedged between two political factions. Those who want to destroy America and those who want to save her.

"You’re the one who came up with the idea of freezing the money of politicians. But if Trumps takes in a few million it’s ok?

Following the election, the Trump Organization reportedly doubled Mar-a-Lago’s initiation fee to $200,000. The club’s revenues reached an estimated $29 million in 2016, up 25% from the year prior. And despite dozens of organizations pulling events from Mar-a-Lago, Forbes estimates the place is worth $10 million more than it was before Trump was elected. Those eager (and wealthy enough) to rub shoulders with a sitting president appear to be flocking to the club, hoping to bend the commander in chief’s ear.

"You are being silly.  Why would they be bribed if all their assets are frozen?

You are assuming Congress can’t do work from home. They only need to read bills and sign them.  All of this can be done electronically.  They would be better off building rapport with people in their districts rather than other politicians.

Yes.  Any semblance of luxury in excess of their means is the chopping block.

For websites, you are assuming that the government provides some sort of service to people.  They don’t provide any valuable services.  In the famous last words of the last great Democrat, “ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country”.  What does a government need any websites for if it shouldn’t be taking any telephone calls either?

On wasting money on people operating phones… it wastes more money answering phone calls or having websites than it does having a call center.

On the government not knowing how to do something cheaply… now we are getting somewhere with you!  Every single thing the government currently does can be done better in the private sector.  Leave it to them.  There exists nothing cheap on government projects!

On DNA similarity.. you aren’t even trying to see my point of view here. You are simply being contrary because you feel you have to oppose me.  Do I have to answer this one in better detail?  How about second cousins first removed and anyone a judge would recuse himself from, like family friends, neighbors, coworkers, etc.  though these types of people should all be allowed in their administration.

"Cheaper than that even. $8600 per unit in the multi-family rentals, of which there are 812. $16.6K per 'affordable ownership' units of which there are 30. The rest is going for counseling and maintaining already built units(255). So you're not even getting 1000, you're getting 842 new units. So of the $7.5M that's actually going to new housing, you're roughly looking at $8900 a unit averaged out. 

And you know that the contractor aint going to be doing this out of the goodness of their hearts so there's going to be some profit made in there somewhere, so figure they're somehow squeezing at least at a minimum of $500 per unit in profit on that much work so $420K in profit there which drops it down to about $8400 a unit averaged. Then you factor in wages for workers to do all this(carpenters, plumbing, electrical, drywall, paint, flooring, etc) and what's left is what you've got for materials. You just know that the materials are going to be the cheapest lead-paintiest, Chinese asbestos laced dry wall bulk materials they can possibly lay their hands on and even then that may be more expensive than they want to lay out for.

I’m not even going to downvote but I seriously ask that you consider what actually makes life worth living. Money is important yes but there are ways we can create an economy that is based on more meaningful and sustainable activities. Consumerism isn’t going to save our economy and inflation is partly fueled by rampant consumerism. Prices go down when demand drops and balance out the effects of less consumer activity. It’s on a curve and we are too far one direction right now.

"I took a quick poke through the code and found the [relevant section](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/58.1-3511/):

 > A. ... the situs for vehicles with a weight of 10,000 pounds or less registered in Virginia but normally garaged, docked or parked in another state shall be the locality in Virginia where registered ...

They've got you dead to rights on owing tax on the car since you left it registered here.

There was a potential escape hatch:

 > Any person domiciled in another state, whose motor vehicle is principally garaged or parked in this Commonwealth during the tax year, shall not be subject to a personal property tax on such vehicle upon a showing of sufficient evidence that such person has paid a personal property tax on the vehicle in the state in which he is domiciled.

Arizona charges a vehicle license tax on cars based on value, which is roughly the equivalent of Virginia's personal property tax.  They just build it into the registration fee; it's separate here because the taxes go toward funding the counties, not the state.  Had you quickly registered the car in Arizona and paid that, you'd have only owed tax for the time it was registered in Virginia.  But that's water under the bridge.

The good news is that, because the car is now registered in Arizona, Loudoun County doesn't really have anything to hold over your head to make you pay.  Making good on the obligation you incurred here would be the right thing to do.  The Treasurer's office has a team that can deal with collections issues that includes arranging payment plans.  Their number is 703 771 5656.

Have you looked at Waterford Village or any of the other apartments in nearby towns? The reviews I'm seeing for everywhere I've seen are really not impressing me. 

Are there any subreddits specific to the Staunton area? If there are, ask the locals. There has to be more than what's showing up.

You'll also find country ham slices in the bacon/sausage sections in grocery stores where you're supposed to fry it first.  Those are also good with a buttermilk biscuit for breakfast.

"I grew up smack dab in the middle of Virginia, right at the foot of the Blue Ridge. My grandmother cured hams for the whole family, and we usually ate them at Christmas. Cooking a country ham was a chore, involving a 5-gallon steel pail, boiling water, and a whole ton of newspapers and blankets. You'd have to see it to believe it. :-D Now, most of the little grocery stores in the area sell sliced country ham by the pound. Ham biscuits are still a favorite of mine. We also get it sliced raw, flour it and fry it, though we save that for our yearly vacation.",t2_e24s2,macynell,0,1648781864.0,0,t1_i2xpvqo,i2xpvqo,False,thatblackman,t3_ttduhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/ttduhs/what_is_the_best_cuisine_in_virginia_what_is_a/,What is the best cuisine in Virginia?

"Moving it out of DC is stupid IMO..  DC is centrally located to MD & VA. If you move it to a suburb of either state, you just made it more complicated to get to work for 2/3 of your employees. Also the federal government wants people to use mass transportation and if you are in DC, you are accessible by all metro lines. Moving it to any of the 3 locations puts them on specific lines... And where are your transfer stations? In DC.l, excluding Rosslyn.

For example, say someone works at HQ and lives in Reston.. their commute in via Wiehle station is already a hour.. you are then going to take the train all the way to L'Enfant and hop on the green line and ride it to the end adding 1 more hour to your commute. Just dumb.

Or you live in Silver Spring now and ride the red line to Gallery place. Quick and easy... Roughly 25 minutes. Cool easy. Now you have to go to Franconia? You are going to transfer at Metro Center (in DC) and add 30 more minutes to your commute. 

JEH Bldg is in bad shape and a new HQ is needed but I think it needs to be in DC.

"Virginia is a surprisingly diverse state, especially in terms of what you’ll hear from as “must eat” food. It’s also kind of spread out for different cuisines, Tidewater will have different food than Richmond, different than NoVa, and certainly different than the western parts of the state that identify more Appalachian. VA country ham and peanuts are what most people will say, but I’ll tell you Chesapeake Bay oysters from the southern bits are some of the best I’ve ever had. VA style BBQ is also my favorite, Pierces Pitt in Williamsburg does it best. If you don’t want to get far off 95 then Plaza Azteca has a few locations near in Richmond. If you’ve ever had “white sauce” at a Mexican place, that was created here in VA.

"They get paid the same as any other politician.  Assets earned by the politician during their service would obviously not be frozen.

"Overall it's a good place to live. The cost depends on how close you are to DC. The closer the pricier but the more opportunities for jobs as well. VA is doing pretty good with covid compared to a lot of other states. 

If you live next to any if the major cities like Alexandria or Richmond you'll have plenty to do. Everywhere else not so much though. 

Living here you'll have to decide if you want to live in NOVA or southern VA because they are almost completely different. NOVA is similar to Maryland and southern VA is similar to North Carolina. 

NOVA is more urban and has a lot of jobs but is costly. It's also diverse and democratic. It also has a lot to see and do like Alexandria harbor or Tyson's corner.

Southern VA is rural and makes up the majority of the state. It has beautiful rolling hills and nature valleys and caverns. However, people generally make less in southern Virginia. It's also mostly republican. 

This is just generalizing though. Many areas in both sections overlap with their traits.

"Your car registration is with the VA dmv. Your license is with the CA dmv, soo…

In VA your license can be suspended (no matter the state your license is in) if you don’t have VA insurance on your VA registered car. Again, No matter where you have a license. 

You should have moved your registration to CA too. 

Now you will likely have to 
- 1 change your registration to CA.

Are Federal taxes used in a partnership with the Commonwealth of Virginia taxes for I-95 maintenance to be constantly repaired and under construction?  Multiple bypass highway routes created to reduce traffic might prevent a repeat of the Snow-pocalypse that Senator Tim Kaine was caught in for 27 hours in his car.  I suggest the Senator and Transportation Secretary Buttigieg work to solve the issue of the I-95 corridor.  A bypass route further east between Fredericksburg and Washington DC could help.  Although I despise toll roads converting this segment of I-95 to a toll road could help maintain it and reduce people like me from driving it to lessen the traffic.  I already attempt roads further west than I-95 to avoid anxiety.

"There is no eviction moratorium, but in Virginia there are rules in place that must be followed before you can evict someone which includes waiting 14 days after notifying the renter that they could file for rent relief before filing for eviction, and actually filing for rent relief (landlord does this) during that 14 days.  Tenants are required to participate in the rent relief program including giving all documentation requested to enter the program to be eligible for protections from eviction, but an eviction can proceed if the tenant refuses to cooperate, is found not eligible for the program or if the program just plain runs out of money to give to landlords.

There is also an automatic 60 day continuance on eviction cases if you can prove you have lost income due to COVID-19 by bringing written proof of said hardship to court.

Regardless, you can still be given notice to quit, can still have an eviction suit filed against you, the court may still allow the trial to move forward based on the information presented to the court, and the court can still issue judgements, orders and writ of evictions against you, and finally, law enforcement can still enforce eviction orders against you.

Renters with 4 or more tenants must offer tenants with COVID-19 specific hardships a 6 month payment plan and tenants must participate in the plan, and sign a declaration their non-payment is for COVID-19 reasons to receive this protection.

"You seem to be having a hard time following this conversation. 

We’re having a conversation about whether OP or you was or wasn’t aware that they were significantly over the speed limit.

One of the following statements is true:

A) the overtaking driver has no situational awareness and accidentally drove significantly over the speed limit because the other driver sped up. Their lack of situational awareness caused them to drive recklessly 

B) the overtaking driver had total situational awareness, recognized the car they were passing sped up, they didn’t want to get stuck behind the driver again, so they intentionally drove significantly over the speed limit and therefore drove recklessly 

You’re trying to say the following that makes zero sense

3) “I’m an excellent driver! I have total situational awareness at all time! I was stuck behind this guy and when I went to pass he must have sped up because, despite my total situational awareness, being in control of my car, and being an awesome driver I drove significantly over the speed limit and it’s the other driver’s fault.”",t2_3fauw,otter111a,0,1648661759.0,0,t1_i2qo32b,i2qo32b,False,Traditional_Tomato30,t3_tr1gah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/tr1gah/reckless_driving_by_speed_a_commonwealth_citizens/,"Reckless Driving by Speed: A Commonwealth Citizen's Tale (Or: Congraulations, You're A Criminal!)",/r/Virginia/comments/tr1gah/reckless_driving_by_speed_a_commonwealth_citizens/i2qo32b/,0,r/Virginia,0,0

And of course that costs money, so your taxes in those small counties can actually be surprisingly steep.  Worse, there's tons of counties; Virginia has well over 100 of them.  So there's a lot of government overhead and waste across the state.  Up here in NoVA isn't not too bad because the counties/cities are huge so costs get spread over a million people.",t2_h4ple,SmaugTangent,1,1648616167.0,0,t1_i2og2tm,i2og2tm,False,Danciusly,t3_trpltu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Virginia/comments/trpltu/gov_youngkin_signs_law_allowing_localities_to/,Gov.

"I said that I was going to 70-75 (my estimate) when I swung out into the oncoming lane.  I had already accelerated to that speed before I started the pass.  I dropped back so I could get up a head of steam.  I do (well, now did) not like lingering while passing.  It unnerves me.  I wanted to spend as little time in the other lane as possible.  As I said in another comment here, I'm simply not going to do it anymore.  It's always struck me as a little nuts that the law allows you to use the oncoming lane to pass, usually on roads where the speed limit is 45 MPH or higher.

When I saw oncoming traffic, I floored it.  That's when I accelerated from however fast I was going (let's say 75) to 99 MPH.  Sir, I was not looking at the instrument cluster.  I was watching the road.  I knew I was going too fast, but I didn't intend to go 99 MPH too fast.  I completely accept responsibility for this, and I swear on the grave of my mother (who died while I was waiting to go to trial, believe it or not) that I did not intend to go that fast.  I wouldn't call it a ""whoopise.""  It was an intense moment and I did everything wrong I possibly could have done in that moment, just not with a plan to go that fast.
