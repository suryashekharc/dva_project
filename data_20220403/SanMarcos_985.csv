"Yes, I don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook‚Äù disabled, but I suffer from seizures, have a TBI, a pain disorder, and several other invisible disabilities that make it difficult for me to complete everyday tasks. My dog took 3 years to train, and he is completely focused on me. But when a person comes in with their yappy dog that‚Äôs lunging at my dog, he could miss an alert, which in turn could cause me to miss me to take my emergency medication in preventing having a seizure in the aisle at Walmart or HEB. It‚Äôs life line for me. And people don‚Äôt understand that. When my dog is in a restaurant with me, you don‚Äôt even know it, he doesn‚Äôt beg for food, because he is highly trained and knows better. He is tucked under the table and is quite unless he needs to alert me to a medical emergency or condition I am having. But people who just slap a vest in their dog and bring them to restaurants or stores. And let them sit in the shopping cart or on the seat at the table, not only is it illegal, but it‚Äôs also a hazard to peoples health and safety around them (those who have real service dogs doing a job) and against health code (by having them sit in shopping carts and on chairs in restaurants).

"San Marcos doesn't really have many formal restaurants. Palmers is the fanciest one that comes to mind. Never been so I have no opinion. Blacks BBQ isn't fancy but they usually have live music and BBQ is usually a crowd-pleaser. 

If your family has never been and you don't mind the drive, head to Salt Lick BBQ out in Driftwood. It's about a 45 min drive from SM, but if you go on a nice day around sunset it's a fun drive. Not so much a fancy restaurant but really popular and good BBQ + live music pretty much any weekend evening. Get there early and BYOB (or any alcohol if that's what y'all are into). We did this after my boyfriend's graduation and had a GREAT time. 

I've seen people recommending the Gristmill over in New Braunfels. I'd recommend Clear Springs Restaurant over Gristmill any day. Sure, Gristmill is definitely the cooler venue with some really pretty outdoor seating, but Clear Springs food is just so good (and cheaper for portions last I remember).

If you want to go somewhere more formal, I'd look for places in Austin. Austin has so many cool places serving just about anything you could imagine.

just not doing well in the space i had for him. so i looked up the fish drop off location, and my room mate and i went. the discovery center was closed, but there was an open gate so my room mate and i ran in, said bye to smudge, and gently poured him in the water water of a pond that was labelled ‚Äúfish drop off‚Äù or something similar. was years ago. after letting him acclimate to the temperature, we dropped him in and dipped. not sure if smudge lived, but was neat there was a place to take him instead of

"They‚Äôre making repairs to the dam because they didn‚Äôt do it right the first time. Portions were being undercut and were in danger of collapsing. 

‚ÄúThe instream structures and bank improvements at Rio Vista Falls that were constructed 15 years ago have never had any maintenance and have resisted consistent strong currents and 3 major flooding events since their construction. In many locations throughout Rio Vista Park, underwater voids or undercuts have formed in the existing bank and structures due to the river‚Äôs strong currents.  This maintenance project will repair the voids and undercuts using a different strategy than was used for the original construction project which will provide a more robust system of protection against strong currents in the future.  This project will also include some minor maintenance work at Dog Beach. In order to perform the maintenance, the river will be dewatered from the upstream drop to near Cheatham Street.  Strategies will be in place to ensure maximum survival of aquatic flora and fauna during the dewatering process.  Additional strategies will be in place to protect the water quality of the river during construction. The project bid has been awarded and construction is scheduled to start mid-September 2021.‚Äù

Sometimes you may not get a fourth roommate. It's rare but it happened to me and my roommates this year. It's only 3 of us paying for the four person room (which still isn't too bad of a price imo at least compared to other places I've seen here).

"I enjoy it, I consider myself completely introverted and a bit on the weirder/quiet side so the people that party tons sometimes bother me cause I can hear their music but it happens more less than often, usually by the end of summer is when it stopped (I'm on the floor right above the pool and gym/rec rooms). I wouldnt worry about noise or other people unless youre under the 13th floor/penthouse or something.

 The area is extremely convenient, I live right off campus it takes me 5 minutes to walk to campus, 5 minutes to walk to the square, downtown sm, theres a ton of restaurants right across the street that have a variety of food (mexican, tex mex, fast food, asian and korean), sewell is also 10 minutes away. You also live on top of the target and across the street from the bobcat quickie gas station in case you need to make any quick or late night trips. If target gets too costly, the walk to HEB is like 7-10 minutes away and not too bad at all. So far I rate it an 8/10 and the price I pay is really good. I pay around 850 for a unit with 3 other people and our monthly bills are like 20$-40$ max in total. The location, furnishings, room space, price, safety precautions, amenities and etc. are good pros.

 The only cons are that there is always at least one elevator broken down or the doors in the back entrance dont work--it seems like there is always something technical going wrong with the building at least twice a month but these are just really nuisances at best because they get taken care of (and we dont have to pay for it).

Democracy, slavery, women‚Äôs rights, civil rights‚Ä¶always conservatives trying to prevent others from having rights.

"Austin is basically center. The juxtaposition with the surrounding area highlights the differences but to pretend like it some ultra far left area, is not really true. Basically everything west of Mopac is Conservative and the policies of the city are often limited by the state or by the 30% of voting conservatives int he area. The largest group of people moving to Austin are other Texans...from liberal and conservative areas. A city will always be more liberal than the surrounding areas because of education, youth & dealing with modern problems. The needs to advance a city tends to push against the ""pick yourself up by your bootstraps"". Not enough bootstraps or community in a downtown than a small town church.

"I would say this is a rather extreme view and why the OP is asking. Being conservative does not mean any of those things specifically. Those are the things that bother you most and get the headlines from people that want you to vote the opposite way.

I consider myself progressive on many issues but if I took the Far Right's definition of progressive(similar to what you are doing here with Conservative) then you would think I want open borders and everything free. Neither are accurate and this actually gives legitimacy of why the OP is asking. 

I think the best tools to help me understand our current situation is to study the middle and ideas like Neo-liberalism. Biden and Pelosi and Clinton are Neo-liberals and that helps explain why ""progressive"" ideas are stalled. The people in power are more closely aligned to others in power.

"It is not wrong to have conservative values. What has happened is that conservatism has been used to ram a bunch of non conservative ideas and the term is conflated. 

Conservatives want to ban books and always spend just as much as Dems when they hold government.  All the while shouting ""small government"" is just one example.  

There are problems with ""liberals"" and ""conservatives"" because the terms are overly broad. What specifically are you asking about being an issue? If you dont have a specific idea or issue that is bothering you, than you now understand why the terms are not very useful. 

Try talking to people about policy instead of labels that are attached to 1000 charged subjects.

Edit: i was raised ""conservative"" swung left and now pretty central so neither of the big names define me. That is the main issue.

"My friend lives in Bishops Square which is, IMO, probably the best of the student housing you'll find. He's had some minor issues, mostly dealing with crickets during San Marcos's lovely cricket season. I live at Parkway Grande (nonstudent housing) and I think overall it's better. It used to be less expensive comparatively, but now I'm not sure. 

Funny enough, as much as I like this place I had the flea issue too! I am of the belief they never vacuumed this place before my move-in. I made them aware I am allergic to animals before ever signing my contract, and they told me not to worry. When I first moved in there were so. many. fleas. and pet hair EVERYWHERE. First time I vacuumed sooooo much pet hair and dirt came up. The maintenance guy was over fixing something and literally said ""wow it looks like it wasn't vacuumed."" 

I called the office for help with the fleas, had to wait a week because pest control only comes on Wednesdays (???), and when the guy got in my apartment he was like ""yeah I can bomb it next week."" I have a pet turtle and had just moved all my furniture in so I told him that was in no way an option for me, and he pretty much said well tough luck. I ended up going to HEB and buying a bottle of flea spray and used pretty much the entire thing on the carpet. 2 passes with that a few days apart and the fleas were gone pretty much within a week. So I would recommend that to anyone who has a flea issue when they move in.",t2_m1dsy,FreckledManatee,0,1647933374.0,0,t1_i1muitk,i1muitk,True,[deleted],t3_tjhvio,https://www.reddit.com/r/sanmarcos/comments/tjhvio/student_housing/,student housing,/r/sanmarcos/comments/tjhvio/student_housing/i1muitk/,2,r/sanmarcos,0,2

"You're fine. I watched the Same Jose, CA area go through the same thing as the Austin area is now. Home prices went crazy and developers started building in all kinds of houses like an hour away and people thought they were too expensive. Well 5 years later and yeah...

The city I'm thinking of is Morgan Hill. Kinda rural..not much going on there. But it's a not-insane commute (1 hour give or take) so all the houses were getting bought up anyway. 

I'm always reminded of Morgan Hill when people talk about stuff like this. Hold that house for as long as you can .. if you can afford to rent it out instead of selling in 5 years that would be ideal. 

Here's an article about the housing market in Morgan Hill in 2005. https://www.google.com/amp/s/morganhilltimes.com/home-price-median-soars/%3famp

In case you don't feel like reading through this: I equate what's happening in Austin similar to what happened in San Jose in the late 90s / early 2000s. I would put the housing market here around the time of the early 2000s. It should continue to insane rates, fallback down, but then be higher and stay higher than anyone thought possible.

"Think of it this way.  Right now you have about 1k sunk in as earnest money.  IF you back out they will just re-list and it will be significantly higher.  All I can say is do not trust their timelines.  I purchased with them roughly 6 months ago and was supposed to move in beginning of March (now I am realistically hoping for July).  I went out there this weekend and I don't even have shingles, walls, or windows yet.  They say 6 months, plan for 10.  By the time you go to lock rates, take a look at the recent listings at DR Horton and make a decision then.  You may end up in an interesting position.  I signed a purchase contract for a 2400 sqft in the same area for about 340 last fall and I expect it to appraise about 50k higher on final inspection.  End of the day, SM is in the ""golden triangle"" of the San Austonio corridor.  Austin and SA are going to creep closer and closer to each other and with SM being a college town in the middle I am banking on the outlying neighborhoods will be going for a premium in 10 years.

"If the past predicts the future, SM will grow more slowly than Kyle and NB, and wind up squeezed between them. Texas State (and the associated student housing and student-related business) actually retard certain kinds of growth, that you see in Kyle/NB.
