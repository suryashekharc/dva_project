Why was this crazy? Because unlike the derailleur or tires or anything else on the bike, the hanger isn't likely to be compatible with another bike. If you are going to jack a person's bike parts, leave the hanger out of courtesy.

When I took my bike to the shape it was a week and a half to get a new hanger shipped.

"I thought I would add to this. The garage 529 project has worked well in other city‚Äôs such as Ottawa (Early statistics there showed 39% of bikes stolen that were registered with the app were later found). 

The Codiac RCMP were giving out stickers early last summer at events. In September I contacted them and they still had some stickers to give out so long as you showed proof that you actually registered with the app. 

It is possible the Codiac RCMP might still have some stickers left over to give out. Stickers would typically cost 12.99 individually on Amazon.

"When I first started cycling I would flip between pedestrian and car rules but it was too confusing. So I generally will now just act like a slower moving vehicle, have lots of lights and hand signals and be extremely predictable. 

Generally I would stay off of the busiest stretches but there is not really an alternative to get from that end of Mapleton Park back to a trail.

"I overestimated my climbing abilities last year and held up Saturday traffic as I struggled up the hill from Mapleton Park past the Old Costco. I normally am cautious but not deathly afraid of traffic but after I got to the lights we decided we probably wouldn't bike that route again. Because once you get to the top of the hill, then you have to get in left turning lane to get to the trail by Rallye and it's a slightly hair raising experience.

On the bright side, the drivers were super courteous and gave me lots of room, but I can only imagine it was because they were completely surprised to see a person on a bike there.

"I definitely hand-picked the most egregious example, but I find these images pretty indicative of Moncton's general attitude towards cycling. The painted bike lanes on Vaughn Harvey are another favourite example of mine, where someone brilliantly put a buffer zone...

...in between the bicycle lane and the sidewalk.

I agree that I feel pretty safe on most shared routes (Gordon/Queen is decent, for example), however I'm also aware that I'm much more comfortable on my bike than the average person, both in terms of maneuverability and situational awareness.

When I see stuff like the images above, I understand why most people I know feel unsafe cycling in Moncton. I doubt anyone would let their 12 year old cycle down Mapleton, despite being designated as a shared route.

"5G phones function at 0.6 watts and send a pulse of up 3 watts when looking for towers. 

Old Bag phones would function at 3 watts (mine's documentation said 4?).

Commercial paging transmitters typically radiate 1000 watts of effective power, resulting in a much wider coverage area per tower than a mobile phone transmitter, which typically radiates around 0.6 watts per channel.

With over 2 million pagers in use today (as of 2022), Pagers are not only alive and well, but are THE backup communication source relied upon by people who absolutely have to be accessible.
There is literally NO place in NB that can't be reached by pager.

The only friction point that I found was that since they do multiple vehicles from multiple clients at once along their routes, pickup and delivery dates can be pretty vague, so I wouldn't go this option if you have very precise deadlines you need to have met. In my case, to get around this, and since I had to move separately, I had arranged for pickup from a trusted shop in my old city without me being there, and drop-off at a shop in the new city I was moving to.

So why would people still be protesting? here's a few reasons that come to mind


-Private enterprise notably the tech industry has been censoring doctors essential deciding what is true . Do you really want some billionaire deciding what you ingest as information online? hell Facebook had censored the bmj for potentially misleading information one of the oldest general medical journal creator of the double blind study

-The loss of bodily autonomy. Now to save lives one could argue that is similar to wearing seatbelts but . Pfizer never tested transmissibility of the vaccine and vaccinated people can still transmit so where is the cost benefit analysis? why is it not made for the individual? For example 89% of covid deaths across all ages had co-morbidity's . now i can only speculate but I would assume that 100% of those deaths under the age of 20 likely had co-morbidity's

-Using coercion for vaccination. Some may of been ethically sound but not when it involves money or food (not necessarily counting restaurants)

>being refused service based on vaccination status

-Transparency . All the data should be available to the public so that any misgiving may be addressed tough not everybody will accept the information presented it is important that they are available

I've yet to be convinced that most of the measures done during the pandemic were for the greater good such is my pessimistic view on politics generally speaking the worst come to power best of luck to all and hopes all is well

"I really agree with the spirit of your comment, but if I had any inkling of hope that Higgs' government gave a fuck about the population of NB (nevermind the homeless population) I would probably have called them out in my comment. But they barely even pretend to care.

Am I glad the government of New-Brunswick ignores its responsibilities? Not at all, and it sucks that the problem has been dumped on municipalities with way less resources. That doesn't change that the Cons aren't and will not ever do anything to address these issues, and at this point trying to get them to do anything vaguely progressive is simply naive. 

Dawn Arnold and her crew at least play the game of pretending to care, so maybe we can shame them for having more than 50% of their 2022 budget allocated to the new RCMP facility instead of something that could actually help Moncton.

"The vaccine was never intended to be a cure for covid, covid is past that its more of a flu shot type of deal. The shot was always intended to help fight off covid, curb unnecessary death and shorten the period in which individuals had covid. The co-morbidities present in a lot of covid deaths are common, asthma, respiratory diseases, auto immune deficiencies are all co-morbidities, really a lot of these restrictions are no worse than having your flu shots up to date and not bringing peanut butter to school because of allergies.

So why would people still be protesting? here's a few reasons that come to mind

&#x200B;

\-Private enterprise notably the tech industry has been censoring doctors essential deciding what is true . Do you really want some billionaire deciding what you ingest as information online? hell Facebook had censored the bmj for potentially misleading information one of the oldest general medical journal creator of the double blind study 

\-The loss of bodily autonomy. Now to save lives one could argue that is similar to wearing seatbelts but . Pfizer never tested transmissibility of the vaccine and vaccinated people can still transmit so where is the cost benefit analysis? why is it not made for the individual? For example 89% of covid deaths across all ages had co-morbidity's . now i can only speculate but I would assume that 100% of those deaths under the age of 20 likely had co-morbidity's

\-Using coercion for vaccination. Some may of been ethically sound but not when it involves money or food (not necessarily counting restaurants)

\>being refused service based on vaccination status

\-Transparency . All the data should be available to the public so that any misgiving may be addressed tough not everybody will accept the information presented it is important that they are available 

I've yet to be convinced that most of the measures done during the pandemic were for the greater good such is my pessimistic view on politics generally speaking the worst come to power best of luck to all and hopes all is well

"Not quite. 

Right lane for turning right. For right indicate right on approach.

Either lane for straight ahead (assuming a two lane roundabout with both lanes exiting - which is how every roundabout SHOULD be designed and built.) For dead ahead do not indicate on approach but indicate as you pass the last exit before the one you'll take. 

Left lane for turning left. For left indicate left on approach.

Actual exit numbers are irrelevant as not every roundabout has only three exits (exactly left, dead ahead, or right) many have lots.

I agree with your points. But:

There are a lot of roundabout's in Moncton with a spurious right lane that is a solid do not cross line (when you can even see it), but you can cross it - and people do because you have the usual procession of idiots in the left lane not realising they are cruising along in a passing lane, or because they want to turn left in 10 kilometres time.

Take a look at the 'roundabout' heading to Dieppe from the ring road for a good example. It was clearly designed by a child during bring your kid to work day. 

Roundabout at Riverview before the causeway is the same, more slip roads off the side you're meant to not cross from but people do, because they have no idea wtf they are doing.

In all my years driving in Europe I've never seen a roundabout designed like that, cause it's a terrible design!

If people could learn the basic rules of the road (right lane for driving left for passing and do not cross a solid line) it would help everything work better.

Never mind the fact that fewer than 1% of drivers approaching or exiting said roundabout's use a turn signal correctly and roundabout's are a dangerous proposition here.",t2_80dk55v,Chris-WIP,0,1648163145.0,0,t1_i1zttbl,i1zttbl,False,rorix39,t3_tm2hmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/,"The zipper merge traffic technique, explained",/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/i1zttbl/,4,r/moncton,0,4

"I lived in Switzerland for almost a decade. In German-speaking countries it's the LAW and you are expected to do the zipper merge. And what you describe above is exactly the point. 

The idea is the same as a roundabout ‚Äî everyone must encounter the problem using the exact same solution. That strips out the complexity. The problem with non zipper merges is that it's every man/woman for themselves. Some people wait, some people are polite and let people in. Some hop on the shoulder to race to get to the front of the queue, etc. That's what creates ""friction"" and increases traffic delays. 

Ditto with roundabouts ‚Äî¬†everyone must enter and exit the intersection using two right hand turns. You enter the roundabout by making a right hand turn, you exit the roundabout by making a right hand turn. Four way stop intersections don't work on the same logic. Some people want to drive straight, other's left, other's right, whose got right of way? Oh but who got to the intersection first? But that lady's being really nice and waiving through someone who doesn't technically have right of way. 

Same problem. Same solution. When you can find a way to transform drivers' disparate wants and needs into a single solution that EVERYONE must follow, it eliminates friction and makes everything more efficient and enables everyone to get their differing wants and needs much more easily.",t2_62pi2whw,Smurfin-and-Turfin,0,1648148888.0,0,t1_i1yuczi,i1yuczi,False,rorix39,t3_tm2hmt,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/,"The zipper merge traffic technique, explained",/r/moncton/comments/tm2hmt/the_zipper_merge_traffic_technique_explained/i1yuczi/,6,r/moncton,0,6

A lot of cities have already been working toward those kind of changes.

Most cities are installing trails, bike lines, and shared routes to promote non-automotive forms of transportation. The problem is that this all costs money and takes time to implement.

"apparently my original comment of ""this guy pad thais"" was not deemed worthy by the mods. Probably for not ""sufficiently adding to the conversation"".

Well allow me to elucidate, having made pad thai at home before, this is a good recipe. I find tamarind paste to be a little hard to work with and usually soak it in warm water and then strain, because you don't really want the fruit fibres in your food, but otherwise, this is legit. Good choice of ingredients too.

"Here's my homemade pad thai recipe: 
SAUCE
2 TBSP tamarind paste (Pantai brand at Oriental Market, West Main)
2 TBSP white sugar
4 tsp fish sauce (Three Crabs brand, Oriental Market)
1/2 tsp ground chilis

This is enough for 1/4 to 1/3 package of wide rice noodles. Soak rice noodles overnight or at least 3 hours in cold water. 

Bean sprouts - half the volume of rice noodles 

Cooked proteins, ie chicken - half the volume of bean sprouts, diced or sliced small.

1 minced shallot or equivalent of minced onion
3 minced cloves of garlic

1 egg 

Green onions if you like them. 
The cooking part takes 5 mins to have everything prepped and in place. 

Heat a bit of cooking oil in a large frying pan to medium. Add shallots and garlic until it smells good. Add noodles and stir very quickly. Add sauce and stir very quickly. Make a small space in the middle of the noodles and crack the egg into the pan. Let it cook for half a min or so and then stir it all in with the noodles. Throw in your protein and bean sprouts. Keep stirring quickly and this should be done in 5 mins. Add green onions to garnish. 

One of the quickest and easiest weekday suppers!

- live music at local bars. Check out bars like Old Triangle, Navigator or Tide and Boar in advance to find some live music. There are often good live music shows at the Tide and Boar in the ballroom, check out the tide and boar website for upcoming events.

"There's also the fact that the younger generations don't go out or drink as much as they used to. I'm in my 30s but back in school, and the difference between students now and ten years ago is insane. Most of them have to work while studying so they can't afford to drink socially.

There also isn't a lot of people past 25 years old who are single. Moncton isn't big enough to have a sustainable population of single late 20s people to patron such a club. Tinder has to have taken a bite out of the bar market in general as well. How many people went to bars and clubs just to meet someone?

"I think its really just a matter of market conditions. There is and always has been an extreme amount of risk trying to open a nightclub. You can only get revenue 2-3 days a week and that's only from around 10pm and on. The people with the actual capitol to open these spots would much rather open a brewery, wine bar, restaurant which is far more dynamic and in demand. We have very few students here and a city which is only now starting to add residents to the downtown. 

What you end up getting with clubs is this carousal of people who either don't know what they are doing, don't have the proper funding to open an actual quality club, or are extremly shady (ie: cosmo owner from many years ago). After that in order to get people into a club that is of poor quality is to lure them in with extremely cheap drinks. Its super difficult to make any profit doing this, you need tons and tons of people coming in, and then your drink prices also now bring in a crowd that people who actually have money to spend don't want anywhere near the place. They'd rather spend 9 bucks a beer or $14 for a cocktail at a tide and boar, wine bar, tire shack etc. 

I don't see this city ever getting a quality club until the downtown population grows immensely or we get a major university closer to the city and I dont blame any good entrepreneur for not opening one. Tide and Boar kind of does it right where they diversified their business, and have a space with the ballroom where they can bring in a DJ and have a ""club like"" atmosphere every once in awhile, but not rely on it to keep the bills paid.",t2_8ns49,lirette,0,1647874628.0,0,t1_i1jc496,i1jc496,False,Objective_Ad_2989,t3_tjc3uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/moncton/comments/tjc3uu/nightclub_recommendations/,Nightclub recommendations,/r/moncton/comments/tjc3uu/nightclub_recommendations/i1jc496/,6,r/moncton,0,6

"Odd. A CBC article in 2018 says a movie came out ""a few years ago"" so I am guessing it must have been real at one point: [https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/rebecca-s-grave-moncton-debunked-1.4886049](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/rebecca-s-grave-moncton-debunked-1.4886049)

\[What has likely fuelled the invented accounts is that there is actually a grave at the site.

Upham said the property once belonged to the Lutes family, among the earliest European settlers in the Moncton area.

A 16-year-old girl named Rebecca Lutes died, probably of tuberculosis, he said, and was buried there in the family plot.

So were three other family members, said Upham.

""When the Lutes family sold the property, they worried whoever bought the property was going to end up accidentally mowing over or plowing up the graves, so they put a concrete cap over it to protect the place,"" he said.

Their idea worked until recent decades, he said, when vandals damaged the gravestones.

That's the main reason Upham isn't keen on perpetuating this particular local legend.\]
