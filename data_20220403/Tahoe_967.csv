"Yep. This is the big one for me. There‚Äôs no mass transit option from the Bay to South Lake. I know a lot of people who use Turo to get a car to drive up here to ski because they don‚Äôt own a car living in the city. But to get up here, they need one. A mass transit option that connected with a shuttle from heavenly would substantially reduce winter traffic at least.

It wouldn‚Äôt help much in summer because people would still need cars to get to trailheads and transporting bikes but less cars and less accidents in winter would be nice.",t2_ehmm0,nullityrofl,0,1649005816.0,0,t1_i38sn41,i38sn41,False,Quacker_United,t3_tvdhmv,https://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe/comments/tvdhmv/whats_your_opinion_if_tahoe_had_higher_density/,What‚Äôs your opinion if Tahoe had higher density housing and biking/bus riding wasn‚Äôt seen much as a poor thing but a thing lots of people started doing?,/r/tahoe/comments/tvdhmv/whats_your_opinion_if_tahoe_had_higher_density/i38sn41/,2,r/tahoe,0,2

"We used to go snowboarding here at Sierra when I was stationed on active duty in the Bay Area decades ago.

We were anxiously following the Caldor fire in the news last August. My friends were forced to evacuate, along with many of you, I'm sure.  I heard that Sierra and other resorts in the area were even using their snow making machines to fight the fire.  

Please support the resort next weekend, if you can. I have LOTS of good memories of Sierra and other places in the area, over many visits during all seasons. Lake Tahoe is just a gorgeous place, no matter the time of year.  If I was still in the area, I would totally ride my splitboard there all weekend. Or do what I used to do years ago and check out different snowboard models in their rental shop. Next time I go back, I might even rent some skis, since I'm looking to buy some AT/ randonn√©e skis :)

"I did the loop last year with 2 friends on April 30th. It was awesome, but we treated it seriously and had similar concerns as you. As another person commented, HWY 50 is no joke and the roads around Emerald Bay are narrow. There is no shoulder in Emerald Bay area and it‚Äôs moderately steep. 

Couple things:
1) How experienced of a road biker are you? If you‚Äôre doing it solo and not that experienced, I would wait until later in the season.. maybe later april or may or june. (Ironically, there are people posting that the summer is better, but you‚Äôll also get the advice that in the summer months there is more traffic so its more dangerous.) I think late April/May is best time for this ride, but obviously closed course / event is the best.
2) If there is a lot of sand/snow melt i would maybe reconsider. Again, super narrow shoulder.

I would consider another route, there are many in Tahoe, unless you are confident in your abilities - it is an awesome ride.

Start early, that makes a big difference in traffic as well. I would go clockwise. Beware of the descent down HWY 50 after the main climb on the east side (spooner summit). There are a lot of drainage grates on the shoulder you do not want to ride over. But it‚Äôs a 4 lane road and a fast descent so you can keep up with traffic pretty well and people have a whole lane to go around you so that helps when giving yourself more room. Few other places on the route have a high speed of traffic, which is nice. The other place that is sub par is just going through all the stoplights in south lake. Stay aware as always on the road but it‚Äôs an amazing ride and one you will not regret! Enjoy Tahoe

Edit: I am not fully aware of road conditions at the current moment so factor that into this decision.

"For those that are questioning the authenticity of this article there is lobby group in place looking to charge a $50 toll to pass the summit on 50 and 80, also new toll tag designations for construction workers, residents, commercial transports and the undesignated weekend warriors south of Roseville.   If you live in the Bay Area and can afford a 2-3 million dollar home I am sure this is nothing but a lot of people from Sacramento outer Bay Area are going to pay the price on this one.

Tahoe is becoming that bar or club you used to go when you were young that got ruined when the news got out about it.  Basically this will be the reset button or door man checking to make sure you look the fit.  I am all for keeping Tahoe pristine and cleaning up the culture and retaining family oriented environments.  However like all great wonders of the world it should be accessible to at least visit.

One more important thing is whether the process of attending a free lift ticket remained the same or changed as I heard some resorts no longer man the ticket office and do everything via pre reservation.

"Interesting as the website states $41 to ride the Gondola. But I do see it‚Äôs likely one of the largest expenses that the resort incorporates onto Heavenly‚Äôs Day passes. Alongside the expensive aerial tram next to the California lodge being another major expense. I don‚Äôt really know the purpose of that tram since there is already a chair lift that carry both up and down traffic much more effectively that parallels the tram. This is likely why Heavenly full price lift tickets are 60% more expensive if not double many others that in addition to having 27 lifts.

All in all To me I suggest if one is an absolute first timer they can save money by going to a smaller resort Ie Sierra at Tahoe(if it‚Äôs open) or Donnor Summit which has a very cheap magic carpet only ticket as first timers often would not be able to use a real lift the first day anyways.

Emerald Bay is crazy popular for good reason. But don't park illegally you will be ticketed. (They take fire access seriously here, any encroachment to the drive line is major problem.)

"I think that the article has a misleading title. 

They are not BATTLING Bay people, they are ACCEPTING the situation. Traffic makes  it too difficult for people to get there for day passes. On February 2nd, they only had 108 skiers,  which is  unsustainable. So, they are going local-only.

"Nah, something about this bugs me...

$64 for a reserved weekday, $104 for a reserved weekend day are cheap but window prices will be higher. This is cheaper than most of tahoe but it seems to me like if skier traffic was really the issue theres a lot more wiggle room in these window rates. Their season pass for tahoe city locals was something like $250 this year while for a south tahoe resident a season pass there competed with the epic local prices. 

It's been covid for 2 years, places like sugar bowl are still doing zero same day lift tickets or reservations for anything last I checked, so expecting walk-ups is still wrong.

It seems to me more like mismanagement; kind of a long-term intention to 'fail' to the public so they can go private to inflate west shore housing development project prices and HOA fees. 

And I've had a great time skiing there 5 or 6 times. But I don't think I've seen or heard of an advertising, promotion, sale... etc. Since 2013. There's huge ski culture in tahoe and they have 100% failed to embrace it. Sierra tahoe was closed this year and they did nothing to fill that gap; there should have been some opportunity there.

To be fair:

From what I can tell from a quick check Homewood is located on private land unlike most resorts which are largely on federal land, so Homewood can do whatever they want.

And the competition resorts are... well.. Not great to deal with I'm sure..

Steeper stuff skied a bit better due to all this. Had to walk through rocks to access some terrain off KT.

For OP, it's California spring take advantage of it! You're not going to be skiing pow. Hit up those moguls and take some spring laps. Playful skis encouraged. And get em waxed!! Ski all morning, get off the mountain and go grab a bite somewhere. Rent some bikes by the lake or something. Have a beer on a porch somewhere. Smoke up a bit and take a walk. The skiing won't be all time, but the experience will still be. Agreed with the person who said you're not going to be skiing any big lines.. well some will but for most of us prob not.. but it's gorgeous this time of year, hot and sunny

(Reading over these comments.. wow. I have a different perspective I can ski dog shit and have a blast lol, also comfortable enough to make the most of bad conditions. I'm not stoked with the season, but I think there's fun to be had still. And NorCal/ Tahoe are amazing most all the time.

"It's not looking great for conditions here in Tahoe, but having a good time, in my opinion, is more about you and your expectations than it is about what nature delivers for snow.

I go to the mountains a lot, and very rarely feel that I wasted my time out there or had a ""bad time"". 

That stated, if you read Brian Allegretto's report on Open Snow, which is an excellent source of info, the news for Tahoe from today was downright depressing.

I personally had a blast skiing East Bowl at Heavenly today, using my rock skis. But I think that the low runs at Heavenly will be done by this weekend, if not Friday.  

In my opinion, in California, Mammoth is going to be the place to be for the next several weeks.  You can usually also find discount lodging there at this time of year. The LA crowds are already at the beach or onto other activities.  You could even take a day trip: leave Tahoe at 7, ski at Mammoth from 10:45ish to close, and drive back to Tahoe. (gas up in Minden or you'll be paying at least $7 per gallon near Mammoth). If going to Mammoth is a possibility, I would strongly suggest that.

"Based on what you're saying, I wouldn't pay extra money to go to the big resorts like Heavenly, Northstar or Palisades, even though I enjoy those resorts myself, they're too expensive for beginner learners. 

The few times I was at Boreal, it's felt crowded because of all the beginners and families with people sitting around in the lodges not skiing. Not my cup of tea but it's very popular among those people who has the exact same requirements that you're listing out.

Diamond Peak and Sierra-at-Tahoe would be my picks for you. Heck, If anything, you might just go to Sierra-at-Tahoe to support them... They were closed this season due to fire in '21, and when they reopen next year, they'll need all the help they can get.

"You‚Äôre welcome! We chose Soda Springs this year because we were all beginners (our 3-year old included), and we figured we wouldn‚Äôt be out too much money if the little one didn‚Äôt like it. Also, we loved that there was an entire area dedicated to kids. 

Final verdict after spending the season there: totally worth it. The little one got a kick out of the tubing, and just playing in the snow in general, and he loved snowboarding. Kids rentals are included in the family pass, so you can get boots, board, and helmet (though we brought our own helmet) each time you go. As time went on, we started bringing a wagon with all our stuff (camp chairs because sometimes there weren‚Äôt enough chairs), our lunches, and snow toys. Because we came into it recognizing that our son would want to do a little bit of everything each day, we didn‚Äôt stress if he didn‚Äôt want to snowboard all day. 

As an adult who knows what they‚Äôre doing, you might get bored with the runs there. Or maybe not. I don‚Äôt know. I just learned this year, and spent most of my time with my son! But my partner went off alone on the green runs, and also had fun.

As far as Woodward/Boreal, I will say that you are correct, it is the sister property to Soda Springs. We‚Äôd (the adults) signed up for lessons at Soda Springs, but due to staffing issues, were sent to Woodward/Boreal. It was much busier than Soda Springs. Maybe it would be enjoyable for you as adults, but for us, we really liked what Soda Springs offered our child.

That said, we did get a private lesson for our son at Diamond Peak (they do lessons for 3-year olds). He had a great time, and was able to go on the Schoolyard run after it. Diamond Peak also has a program for parents where they purchase only one ticket so that one person can work with the child, and the other one can snowboard or ski, and then they can switch off. It worked perfectly for us. Honestly, my partner snowboarded down Schoolyard too while I worked with our son ü§£. It was great. But DP doesn‚Äôt have the kids play area that Soda Springs has, so while we had a wonderful time that day, we appreciated being able to return to Soda Springs with our pass.

Hope that helps! It might be different for you since you both know how to snowboard already, but Soda Springs was a great choice this year for three newbies (one of whom is only 3 years old!).",t2_11mhx0pj,Themellowsaguaro,0,1648514847.0,0,t1_i2i9dz7,i2i9dz7,False,DrivenTrying,t3_tpxc5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/tahoe/comments/tpxc5x/ski_resorts_for_families/,Ski Resorts for Families,/r/tahoe/comments/tpxc5x/ski_resorts_for_families/i2i9dz7/,1,r/tahoe,0,1

"I'll give you my perspective, for what it's worth. I was once a pretty decent kiteboarder, although I was a couple of years out of practice when I moved to Incline. I thought I would get back into it, but after looking at the conditions in Tahoe, particularly the Incline launch, I opted out. It has every hazard you experience in kiteboarding except (probably) sharks, so you will need to be strongly on your game before going out there and will need to find a way into the community (community is very important in kiteboarding). 

All that said, the sport is awesome and if you're willing to put in the work you'll get there. The best approach would be to drive down to the delta -- Sherman Island is probably one of the best places in the world to learn. You can also camp there (ahem, semi legally) so you don't have to blow out the bank to get plenty of time on the water. 

I have to admit that I've never looked into Washoe Lake as much as I should have. It also seems pretty risky (upwind launch and water hazards) so I doubt they have lessons there, but it seems like it could be pretty good once you're self-sufficient. 

My plan is to get into wing foiling this year. I think that for the conditions we have in Tahoe it will be a lot safer, but I'm skeptical we'll have enough wind to make it really work.

"Thank you! This detail is so useful. I looked up Diamond Peak, but didn't notice the lack of a magic carpet. I snowboarded at Diamond Peak before, but this was before becoming a parent so I didn't even notice the family/kid amenities.

I've always been curious about Mt. Rose, but it will have to wait for another year because they don't do lessons for 3 year olds.

I appreciate your commentary on the school yard too. It's absolutely something to consider. We just came back from Palisades and the school yard was less than inspiring.

"Thank you for the suggestion! Soda Springs looks great! They have a ton of options for small kids. The family pass is only $549 this year and a one hour private lesson is only $100 (only available for 4+ thought). I really like that they have a Woodward Start Park (can be used without taking a lesson). The runs would probably get pretty boring as a parent.

Boreal is apparently their sister site. They also have the Woodward Start Park and a magic carpet (have to confirm this is available outside of lessons). A season pass this year was $529 and a 90-minute private lesson is $150. They haven't listed their 22-23 pricing yet. They have tubing, but no season pass option and it's actually pretty pricey at each visit costing $49 for 90 minutes.

Home sales will only cover costs if they plan on making it some ultra-lux resort which they are apparently ""trying not to do"". Second, the traffic excuse doesn't make sense either. You also have to deal with Palisafes traffic to get to Palisades, yet people still go. Homewood has a reputation for their lifts being broken down constantly. That is why most people I know don't go there. The last couple of times I was there they had a least one lift break down for several hours at a time.

"Lots of good comments from other posters.

* Heavenly is just fine for beginners.... it's just the cost associated Heavenly or other major resorts, since as a beginner you're not accessing 90% of the runs anyway.
* If you're you're staying in South Lake Tahoe, you're not going to want to drive to Tahoe Donner, Northstar, Donner Ski Ranch, Homewood, etc. You'll spend an hour+ each way driving to one of those places, but that kind of kills your weekend.
* Assuming you are staying in SLT, Diamond Peak & Mount Rose are your best semi-nearby, cheaper choices. If I was just learning, I'd go to Diamond Peak as the cheapest, least crowded.
* If not staying in SLT, I'd look at Donner Ski Ranch, Tahoe Donner, Diamond Peak as best /cheapest places to learn.

I've done this not too long ago, most of this is with the idea of kids or brand new adult skiers. You want to optimize for the longest flat greens without a shocking steepness increase. Something I did to check the runs the green skiers would be on was to check [openskimap.org](https://openskimap.org) and find the slope (max and average) for the greens at that resort. Once you go to one resort, you can check its grade and compare with other resorts. With all that said, here's my take if I was doing it again:

1. Tahoe donner - I've never ski'd here but looking at their ski map and the sheer amount green and length + cheap lessons make it look ideal.
2. Mt Rose - Longer maybe more flat than desired bunny hill (show off), then progress to to longer green trails on Wizard lift (somewhat narrow and has more flat spots than desired), to Gallena (starting to move towards intermediate). The big selling point is they have lots of longer green trails that are cutting through forest and it's a better vibe. Put another way, you can ""explore"" different green paths here throughout your learning, whereas other places it will be ""here is one hill, and here is another""
3. Kirkwood - Haven't ski'd these before either but glancing at the map, it seems to be one of the longer green runs for a bunny hill. + a couple gradual upgrade runs before intermediate.
4. Sugar Bowl - Progression here is bunny hill on Judah side, to white pine lift, to nob hill. White pine is shorter than I'd prefer but a nice run to lap and learn turns before heading over to nob hill, and then onto pioneer trail or some of the easier intermediates.
5. Diamond Peak - Schoolyard run is the bunny hill, looks SUPER flat in person, but evidently its steeper than mt rose's bunny hill. Next step up is Lodgepole, which is steeper of a step up than I'd hope for (Similar to sugar bowls nob hill but longer, similar to mt roses galena in length)

Dont do:

Northstar - Lots of intermediate terrain but only greens are very crowded from inflows from all their other trails.

All of this is from the perspective of a very cautious, anxious skier. Some new learners could be bored skiing all those lifts above in the first day or 2 and ready for intermediate blues. Some might spend a few weekends/trips working on turns there before moving up.

"It really comes down to a number of factors with elevation being the primary factor. The warming of the atmosphere is going to hit ski areas at lower elevations sooner than those up here on the summit. The increasing variability in our snow from year-to-year is going to really stress the smaller ski areas around Tahoe and in the Sierra Nevada. In the next 10-20 years, we'll see a lot of them unable to operate during the winter because of the feast/famine conditions that develop. There have already been a few cases of this on the east coast. Even the large resorts are expected to start struggling in the next 20-30 years, which is why many of them are taking a proactive stance in climate change. 

Another factor to consider is that the snow season is getting shorter. In the 70s, temperatures were low enough to ensure that October - May was likely to have snow. We now have temperatures above freezing in October and May, which means that we're seeing less snow and more rain during those months. 

Overall, we're looking at the shrinking of area with snow and the window of when it snows each winter. Most of the resorts in the Sierra Nevada are already having to deal with it to some extent, but it will become much more prevalent in the next 1-3 decades. 


Regarding the argument about whether summer or winter business is better. Lets not forget that our snowpack is a natural deterrent for forest fires that keeps the forest floor and vegetation moist through late spring and, occasionally, the summer on good snowpack years.

"I've only been here for a little less than a year so far, but I can tell you that my most memorable moment at the lab was probably on Christmas Day.

"This is actually a fairly complex question. The central Sierra Nevada don't have a strong correlation to La Nina for our precipitation, and our snowfall can generally either end up above or below average during La Nina years because there are no strong trends (about a 50/50 shot). So, I would lean towards saying that we haven't had much, if any, snow as a direct result of La Nina. With that said, the El Nino Southern Oscillation definitely has an impact on overall North American weather patterns, so there could be a little influence there. Ultimately, we would need an attribution study to determine the effects of the La Nina on California's snow this winter, which would likely take a year before it could be published.

"Juat expressing my thoughts:
So I finally ticked off Tahoe to ski. The views from every angle are insane, we had bluebird days, sunsets and also a little storm. Everywhere we went was incredibly fascinated to see and absorb, but I feel like the skiing wasn't as good as many other places I've been (apologies to offend).

I feel like, if there had been more snow, the double black bowls on the mountains would've made me tick all boxes. But with the slight lack of snow, I steered away from them (missing my right ACL too from a previous injury).

I'd definitely  love to come back in the summer for more hiking, being on the Lake etc, but I feel like I wouldn't have a desire to ski there again which is different to many other resorts I've been to.

All in all; views were insane from nearly anywhere you go. Food options were good (I'd recommend Riva Grill, Hells Kitchen and Fire+Ice in SLT, also Red hut cafe for breakfast ), the apres was pretty poor in comparison to Europe. But that maybe because I wasn't there during USA holidays. People are all friendly and happy to chat wherever we were.

Hope I don't offend anyone. Just thought I'd share my experience!

**Short-Term:**

""It's getting really frustrating as we get later into the season and we have only been seeing storms in inches and not multiple feet like we normally see in Tahoe. The last time a storm hit 2 feet of snow was 12/27. We just had another weak system Tuesday and another on the way for Saturday, with a falling apart system in the middle Thursday.""  
""...We have been tracking clouds with a falling apart system moving through CA Thursday. That's how pathetic it's gotten, we're tracking clouds. ""

**""Fantasy"" (extended) forecast....**

""High pressure builds in over CA Monday - Wednesday. That will bring a dry and mild pattern. Highs into the 50s at lake level and 40s for the upper mountains Mon - Tue, then possibly up into the 60s at lake level by Wednesday.

The ridge is still forecast to start breaking down by the end of the week. That should bring the highs back down into the 40s & 50s. The European model is still faster to break down the ridge with a trough digging down the West Coast into the weekend of the 26th, and possibly a weak system moving through.

"Honestly, at this point Heavenly has become my least favorite ""big"" Tahoe resort, more than Northstar, for these reasons:

-Crowds: they're even bigger at Heavenly than Northstar. The only place with bigger crowds is Palisades on a powder day, but hey, at least there's powder. Plus the vast majority of skiers at Heavenly are pretty bad, so going down crowded groomers can get dangerous

-Terrain: I think Northstar has pretty comparable tree skiing and groomers to Heavenly. Everyone says Mott Canyon is great, but it's never been open when I've gone. Not really a great asset if it's closed all the time. Gunbarrel is cool, and in theory Heavenly has better snow than Northstar because of the higher altitude, but in general there's not a big difference imo

-Navigation: Once you get out of the base Northstar is fine. Lots of fast lifts. You can easily lap the Backside and Lookout Mountain. Hard to get lost. Meanwhile Heavenly is just a mess. It may be big but it's a huge pain to get around different areas. People call it Flatstar, but it has nothing comparable to the interminable, flat catwalks that you need to ski at Heavenly to get between the CA and NV sides. Which you have to do depending on where you parked, which leads me to...

-Parking. The Northstar shuttle is lame, but there is ample free parking. Meanwhile Heavenly has three tiny lots that are all far apart and fill up immediately, even on weekdays. Then you're left with trying to street park. In December my friends were getting rentals at the village, so I literally had to pay for parking at Harrahs and walk over. Then, if you do park at the gondola, you can't even ski down. We had to wait an hour just to board the gondola to get back to our car.

Overall the Heavenly experience is just more likely to be annoying. Just as expensive and crowded as Northstar, but with even more tourists there for the gambling.

"Agree with you. Climate change is a holistic problem in the sense that reducing CO2 in the USA is a very small knob compared to reducing CO2 in China and other places where our politics might not prevail. 

The U.S. is terrible in terms of energy consumption per capita.  That definitely needs to be improved! At the same time, we are foolishly considering spending huge amounts of capital to make tiny reductions in the globe's output of CO2, when the actual knobs, the ones that could actually make a difference, are making headway with GROWING CO2 emissions from China and India.

"People don‚Äôt like:

1) Not as steep as the other big Tahoe resorts, and there is no real expert terrain. The hardest area is Lookout Mountain, which is considerably less steep than Mott Canyon (Heavenly) or Wagon Wheel Bowl/The Wall (Kirkwood). It‚Äôs still somewhat steep, but if you‚Äôre a chute loving cliff jumper, you will be sorely disappointed.
2) Parking is a disaster, involving long waits and crowded buses.
3) Saturday crowds are truly ‚Äúepic.‚Äù Seriously, steer clear of Comstock Express on a Saturday morning. Lines can routinely exceed 20 minutes. (Vail is upgrading it to a 6-pack for next season though; we‚Äôll see if it helps.)

There are some awesome things about Northstar too though:

1) Amazing intermediate terrain and groomers. On a weekday you can seriously bomb down them.
2) Best terrain parks in Tahoe, possibly in California. Plus, they have a halfpipe!
3) Really upscale resort. The village is high end, everything is well marked, and almost all the lifts are express chairs.
4) Lots of good tree skiing (although a close second to Heavenly in my opinion).

"This year a Tahoe Local epic pass was $523, but they may raise it next year since their main competitor Ikon charges more than they do. They haven't announced pricing for next year yet. This has holidays blacked out but it gets you access to three of the bigger Tahoe mountains. Plus 5 bonus days at Vail owned resorts in Colorado and Utah. But since it's pretty cheap for access to three of the biggest mountains a lot of people get it so those mountains can get pretty crowded.

Sierra charged $500 for no blackout days last year, $400 with, but then didn't open due to fire. It looks like they are planning on opening for a bit starting in April so they should be open next year probably. I imagine prices will be similar this year.

Diamond Peak is charging $444 if you buy theirs by the end of April and this doesn't seem to have any blackout days.

Sugar Bowl is $669 with blackout days, Mt Rose is $795 with blackout days, there's a $595 option with blackout days and no weekends in Jan/Feb too. Both are more expensive with no blackout days obviously. Homewood is $749 for unrestricted with no option for a cheaper restricted pass. Donner Ski Ranch is $450 but a smaller mountain. Bigger than Boreal, but smaller than Sierra or Diamond. Soda Springs is very cheap, was $239 last year, but is very small, similar to Boreal I think, maybe even smaller. Tahoe Donner is 530 but is smaller than Donner Ski Ranch. Boreal was $529 this year but very small. Ikon Pass gets you both Palisades mountains, but is $769 for the one with blackout days.

In summary, Sierra, Diamond Peak, or the tahoe epic pass depending on how much they raise it are probably your best bet.

Yes, my goal is to find somewhere with as low a likelihood of encountering dogs as possible, without being one of those people who takes a dog where it's not allowed (I would never do that). I *do not* want my dog to infect any other dogs, that's what I'm trying to avoid, but even dogs with kennel cough need exercise and mental stimulation. This is his one chance potentially for quite a while to experience snow.

I would keep him an absolute minimum of 50 ft away from any other dog on a hike, and would just leave if another dog came to a snow play area. He also wears a muzzle with a stool guard which will minimize forward transmission, especially since he's no longer coughing so any viral load he might have is just in his ordinary breath. The muzzle has two other bonus effects: he cannot lick or closely sniff objects that other dogs might then lick or closely sniff, and other dog owners actually keep their distance if I unexpectedly encounter a dog when I take him on potty walks.

Feeling like I shouldn't have even mentioned the kennel cough since people are fixating on it. I don't let my dog interact with strange dogs on hikes anyway so it's essentially irrelevant; he'll be social distancing more than adequately.

I live in an apartment so dog-friendly that it has its own dog park, so I find the concept of my dog not existing in any space a dog might eventually be in pretty unrealistic.
