"Well done. Thank you for those observations. The truth of Brownsville is exactly as Professorgigs lays out. Plenty of beauty down in Brownsville, especially the people. I’ve noticed that people who are generally the life of the party find Brownsville and the RGV as a whole extremely satisfying, and those that need to be entertained tend to want to espouse big city life as better options. If you like outdoor nature-y stuff, Brownsville has great options. Countless miles of hike and bike trails, city and State parks, national wildlife refuges (go to Laguna Atascosa for an excellent mountain biking experience), the world birding center and it’s satellite sites are nearby, a virgin beach in Boca Chica beach, which is abutted by the Space X spaceport, called StarBase (check that out too, refer to this website for road closure information: https://starbasestatus.com/closures/), a developed beach in South Padre Island, with restaurants and bars (if you like karaoke, hit up the Coral Lounge) and then more virgin beaches for miles and miles once you get out of SPI city limits, and like Boca Chica, you can drive along the surf til you get to the end, and there are snack trucks that drive around out there on Padre Island. If you like fishing, there are piers, resacas, boat ramps, jetties, the surf, rivers (Rio Grande nearby, and easily accessible through Boca Chica, and the Arroyo Colorado, which is accessible in Arroyo City, just google Arroyo City fishing cabins) the ship channel, and canals that you can hit up for free or a small fee. If you like hunting, there are leases you can reserve in the northern portion of the Valley. The zoo is great, and should be on your list of things to do. If you like history, check out the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park and it’s satellite site down the street, Resaca de la Palma National Battlefield, to see and learn more about the first and second battles of the Mexican-American war. If you make your way to Boca Chica, stop by the observation deck at Palmito Ranch to observe where the last battle of the Civil War occurred. Hit up UTRGV/TSC. It was built on a former Army base so a good number of the buildings are old, and the history of what happened on the base is great to learn. If you're nervous about traveling to Mexico because of the reported violence, go to Progresso. It’s a small little border town about 35 mins from Brownsville, that has become a touristy place for the local Winter Texans, that decided to stay because the cost of living is so low here, and the medical/dental services provided in Mexico are also ridiculously low priced, that I would recommend if you have any need to receive expensive medical treatment, consider getting it addressed in Mexico while you’re here. Don’t buy into the services being sub-par. The Mexican food here is amazing, however many locals have no clue that they’re residing in the middle of the best place in the United States to eat Mexican food, since the overwhelming majority of them prefer their mom’s cooking. There’s something about being right on the border and as far south as one can get that makes the food better. El Paso’s Mexican food is too Tex-Mex to qualify. Anything pass Brownsville, and the food starts to get Tex-Mexified. Hit up the Broken Sprocket for outdoor evening food, drinks, and live music, with multiple food trucks to choose from. I have more to add, but the last thing I’ll mention, get a Michelada from one of the drive thru beer barns, and asked for it to be prepared. I drink mine with a Negra Modelo. Different beer barns prepare their michelada mix differently, and make the top lid prepared in really elaborate ways (think pickles, cucumbers, shrimp, fruit, candies, etc.) Also, hit up the local snack shops, paleterias, and panaderias.",t2_52zslaa3,ICanHearYourFarts,0,1648821377.0,0,t1_i2zfa7b,i2zfa7b,False,Head_Historian6025,t3_trvytl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brownsville/comments/trvytl/visiting_brownsville_as_a_solo_female_traveler/,Visiting Brownsville as a solo female traveler,/r/Brownsville/comments/trvytl/visiting_brownsville_as_a_solo_female_traveler/i2zfa7b/,2,r/Brownsville,0,2

"For Brownsville, that's absolutely blown out of proportion. The rules for safety here are no different than those of any American city, so your experience as a solo female traveler should already tell you what to do and not do.

Every now and then, an incident will happen of course, but if you don't watch the news, you'd think this is a peaceful town! The ""scary things about Matamoros"" don't bleed over to Brownsville (or at least they do without disturbing anybody). Also, Brownsville PD invested millions of dollars into making downtown safe - every intersection has security cameras, and having seen their surveillance room, if you pick your nose downtown, BPD will know!

"it’s a small town, not much to do, and the hiking isn’t good. land is flat as far as the eye can see and our plant life consists of mostly brush and mesquite; laguna atascosa is the best place for a hike. SPI access 5 is a great place to hike or spend the night at if you’re looking to sleep on the surf; boca chica beach is cool too and that beach allows you to drive towards the back bay for a good swim. warning, you need 4x4 for both.

edit: Also no hate towards my hometown, but it is what it is; you’ll probably find yourself bored and the food is bad. The tacos and seafood are the only good thing here. I will say this though, it’s better than california and it never gets cold here; so enjoy the beach 👍

"Brownsvillian here (raised for over 17 years), it is a beautiful and simple little town.

Hackberry is a good area to live around. You'll be 10 min from everything. There's a few walking trails near by. Nightlife is pretty chill and you won't be far from most bars. Island will be about a 30 min drive. Be prepared for the heat! Cost of living is reasonable for the area's pay.

"Brownsville is beautiful! Now more than ever, there's many options for how to spend your time here. First I'll give you the more ""touristy"" stuff:

\- You can go hiking at any of our local nature preserves and check out our unique birds, butterflies, and other animals.

\- If you like history, Brownsville's past is AMAZING!! The museums and other local sites will tell you a taste of our incredible stories.

\- If you haven't been to a zoo in a while, the Gladys Porter Zoo is a classic American zoo, and it makes for a great day trip.

\- TACOS!! You cannot go wrong with your taquerias in Brownsville. Try Ultimo, Sheko's, or the ones over in Southmost for a taco experience unparalleled in Texas.

\- If you'll be traveling outside of town, South Padre Island makes for a fun day trip if you like the beach! If you want a quieter beach, there's also Boca Chica Beach, assuming SpaceX haven't closed it.

Now for more ""local"" advice:

\- There's ALWAYS something going on. Events, community gatherings, fun & games... The beauty of Brownsville is in the people, and if you tell them you're visiting, they'll be sure to point you in the right direction according to your preferences. The most accessible people who are ""in the know"" of what's going on can be found every Saturday morning in the farmer's market in the Mitte Cultural District. Go there, ask for the organizers (the Brownsville Wellness Coalition), and ask them a specific question for what type of place/event you'd like to visit. If they don't know, they'll know someone in the market who does.

\- If you're into partying and drinking, go to the bars in North Brownsville for a ""good time"", but the bars in Downtown Brownsville for a ""long time"" - namely those around Market Square. Even if you're here for a month, I suggest the latter for a friendlier, more ""community"" type of environment.

\- Go to Hueso de Fraile on Elizabeth Street at least ONCE. They're the cultural hub of Brownsville's Elizabeth Street, and were the pioneers in reinvigorating Downtown.

I'm sure there's more to it. Likewise, if you have a specific question please let me know. Brownsville's a gorgeous, dynamic, and romantic city, and her visitors deserve to see the best of her.",t2_b40ke,ProfessorGigs,0,1648610616.0,0,t1_i2o699j,i2o699j,True,Head_Historian6025,t3_trvytl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brownsville/comments/trvytl/visiting_brownsville_as_a_solo_female_traveler/,Visiting Brownsville as a solo female traveler,/r/Brownsville/comments/trvytl/visiting_brownsville_as_a_solo_female_traveler/i2o699j/,16,r/Brownsville,0,16

"You gotta use the language every day. So if you don't got a reason to use it every day you'll need to find one.

However a few ways

1. Put post it's on stuff all your house with the Spanish translation ie your fridge, door, or cat.

2. Put subtitles on all your shows, even if their in English (I do this anyway because most shows have terrible sound mixers) however turn the language from English to Spanish.

This is a common technique to help children learn a foreign language.

3. If you have a partner, practice on them. Sexy talk is a good technique. If you don't have one find a Spanish teacher... 

4. Start swearing in Spanish. This a big one. Lots of English language classes for immigrants will usually focus on this. It's really helps people. 

5. Listen to Spanish songs.

6. Do Spanish stuff. Go to Spanish shows, restaurants. Try to order.

"I’m fucking from Brownsville.

The maga-chuds are American taliban, that includes abbot.

Each believes in restricting voting, subjugating women and limiting access to education. Neither believes in science.

Both are against a secular government. Each advocates for the death penalty. Neither favors immigration. And each harbors extremists.

They supposedly love America- but hate Americans.

They call themselves patriotic, but cheer on terrorists who attack the Capitol chanting “hang Mike Pence” and built a gallows on the White House lawn.

They believe anyone who disagrees with them is part of a ridiculous conspiracy- a cabal of leftists who want to…? Take your guns? Make sure you have healthcare?

They believe if your poor, your either too dumb or too lazy to not be.

They like to believe America is a Christian nation (it isn’t), but one of their biggest foes is Christ himself “heal the sick, care for the weakest among us, and always pray in private.”  

Ideological Purity, Compromise as weakness, A fundamentalist belief in scriptural literalism, Denying science, Unmoved by facts, Undeterred by new information, A hostile fear of progress, A demonization of education, A need to control women’s bodies, Severe xenophobia, Tribal mentality, Intolerance of dissent, and a pathological hatred of the U.S. government.

They call themselves republicans (republicans shouldn’t). They are a party of terrorists and grifters, making their own constituents into rubes in the big con. 

Every bit as sad and pathetic as the farmer who shot at me at Camp Slayer who has been whipped up into a religious fervor and actually believes American Soldiers are eating babies and stealing oil- fed on propaganda bullshit, but completely out of touch with reality.

So too, are those Americans fed a steady diet of Fox, newsmax, OAN and Breitbart. It’s brainwashing- Hillary is running a pedo ring? The FBI is trying to curtail parental rights? There’s a Jewish space laser? There’s also Biden controls gas prices, there’s the pending commie takeover of the country, Dems want white people extinct and you have Carlson pushing replacement theory…and it’s all lies to get you whipped up in a frenzy and ready to do violence on their behalf. They want you armed, absolutely furious and ready to kill.

"There really isn't a shortcut. Practice. One of the beautiful things about latino's  is they actually go out of their way to try and teach you if the intention and effort is there.

&#x200B;

White people on the other hand act pretty damn rude if you try to speak English, they'll sometimes purposely pretend to not understand for the sake of embarrassing you. It's horrifying for any foreign person trying to practice English in a real life setting. Not all of them OFC but for sure A LOT of them. The reason I'm pointing this out is because latino's are the complete opposite and will go out of their way to make sure you understand something. Don't be afraid to try because you think someone will make fun of you.

"I try to vote on policy but unfortunately, at times a I actually know these politicians, and they are worst than trash.   For example, I had the unfortunate experience of meeting one of our politicians in a professional manner when I was 20 yrs old. I was young,  dump, poor, and still attending college.
This politician treated me like crap I felt very like the stereotype that everyone depicts ""stupid Mexican"" or rather that's how she treated me.  
Fast forward more than a decade and I met her again... this time I was an educated woman, with double master's and in a position of authority. She treated me well, and was courteous and I thought good for her she's being kind and caring.  But an incident happened at a certain event and alas her true character came out... once again I saw the despicable woman that I met when I was 20. She is full of classism ideologies/  discriminates against the poor, just hateful.
And I hear everyone always talking how great she is and her policies. I think to myself so many have her ""average"" thinking policies and they are not as nasty as she is.  So to answer your question if I approve and like some policies but if I think a politician with a better character is out there... well then yes I vote based on both.

"Born and raised here too. Although we have our perks... Not enough for you to move to Brownsville. As to the pandemic, this area is as bad as everywhere else, and now many kids are in the hospitals. 

The beaches are not pretty because we have the gulf tide, no crystal waters. We have a zoo that needs a lot of work.  We have one very popular festival, ""charro days"", which consists of parades  and some concerts (basically adults and our city officials getting drunk and eating).  The school system lacks teachers and  just about everything else. Private schools aren't any better either... the same goes for charter schools.  

The weather is HOT we basically have two seasons summer and ""esta fresco"" (it's  cool). 

If you are an outdoor person there is not much of hiking / camping  to do other than fishing. If you like culture: museums, bookstore readings, lectures,  etc... those are few and far between. Museums are limited to only the history of the valley. No museum exhibitions, we don't have  bookstore, lectures from experts only happen at our local university, UTRGV. 

Food is good! Culture  shock if you're not hispanic. It helps to know a bit of Spanish and if you don't you'll pick up a bit within several months of living here.  Politics, ugh, don't get me started. Too much ""compadrismo"" (nepotism of some sorts) very frustrating. We lack infrastructure to service a big population, we have a lot of traffic. Usually,  everything is full and waiting list are abundant in restaurants and in every service. 

  Brownsville lacks physicians and medical specialists of all sorts, usually doctors recommend you to doctors out of town (very few neurologists and cardiologist, etc) so if you go to the doctor's office expect a wait (with or without a pandemic).  However,  your other option would be going to Matamoros, MX for your medical needs... it's very cheap and also very effective. With $50 you can see a dr and get your meds too. One last thing,  it's getting expensive... real estate has gotten too expensive because of SpaceX.

 All in all if you want to retire, go fishing,  or want to raise a family without worrying about school violence AND YOU CAN STAND THE HEAT... yup this is the place.  But if you are looking for entertainment on a weekly basis like museums, concerts, new restaurants, having a drink with friends, going to a park, etc... this is probably not the place for you. I see many of our high school graduates leave because Brownsville lacks all these.

"I'm a Brownsville native; born and raised. Question.. Is your main worry about moving to Brownsville COVID-19? .-. 

Well it isn't horrible, we have cases just like any other city, but not bad enough that every person you know plus their parents and friends is dying. People are pretty good about keeping on a mask when in public spaces. I do notice that people aren't really taking the '6 feet apart' reccomendation too seriously anymore. Students from elementaries to colleges are in person again, so let's see how that goes. Most jobs require employees to be working on site. There isn't a limit capacity to most places. You usually don't see people wearing masks at parks. I don't follow COVID case numbers too much, but all in all, La Raza seems to be pretty chill and well. I was actually hospitalized about 2 and a half weeks ago, nothing related to COVID, and i didn't hear the nurses talk about the virus at all. I even asked and they let me know that the situation was not out of the ordinary (as far as pandemic standards go). It's worth mentioning that the city is at Level 3 (Significant) on the 'Threat Matrix' scale. Most of the people I have spoken too and many of my friends have gotten their vaccines, I personally have not. I mean to summarize, we're doing well as of now. Dios bendiga mi cuidad 🤞. 

Ok, moving forward. South Padre Island Beach is a beautiful beach. Great place to visit with your family! Make sure to take lots of water and shade when you visit, it gets HOT! There is a small number of activities that are worth mentioning in the near by city of Port Isabel like the light house, the fishing pier, a few interesting crafts, and arts shops. South Padre Island (City) has a few carnivals areas, dolphin watch,   paragliding rides, cart rentals. Mostly though, you go there for the beach. Take your own lunch though, maybe you'll get a different opinion from someone else, but the restaurants are pretty WACK😂. 

By the way, Boca Chica is a street. It's also the name of the beach at the end of that street, and not a very attractive one. I wouldn't really take a cutie there, unless ya'll plan to walk for miles. Nothing really going on there, but Elon and his rockets.

I don't know about the rest of Texas, but Brownsville is a good option if you like the quiet life. People aren't going to bother because everyone is busy trying to make a living. Learn some spanish if you don't know any, i very HIGHLY recommend it for the best experience. You'll be able to network and get some cheap labor in many different fields of work. Plus, it's just the culture, man. The city officials are trying to modernize the place by bringing in new restaurants, and that's good and all, but it's all just some hipster sh*t 😂. You CAN NOT beat the local guys selling mariscos, tamales, and not to mention the TACOS 😋. Most of these local guys were legends on the other side of the border, and they made it over to Brownsville as testament of their success. I promise you this is as authentic as you are going to get without crossing over to Matamoros, which, BTW, is only minutes away from wherever you are in the city.

Hopefully this long response doesn't bother you. I just wanted to give you as much information as i could, because i doubt you'll get many natives on Reddit. Let me know if you do come down, please respect my city. I really love it and i hope that God bless it.

"I disagree, If by education we are referring to a schooling system such as high school or university and not those who are “self-educated” than there is a strong correlation between the amount of education received and books read after completion of those degrees. 40% of Hispanics in the country surveyed said they have not read a book in the preceding 12 months (I mention this because of the sheer number of Hispanics in the RGV). 44% of those who are considered “high school or less” fit in this same category. While only 8% of college graduates fit into this category.

"Been heavily into Finance for over 2 years now. I had 500k Dogecoins but sold early like a paper handed noob. At your age or anyone under 40 really needs to take more risk. Roth IRA's are a really slow investment tool with minimal risk. If you want to make the big bucks you have to get in early on things. We're still early to crypto but certain alt coins will probably out perform bitcoin in the long run especially if you don't have 50K or more to invest

I've doubled my money many times that's easy. What's great is when you 10x or 20x your money and that'll only happen in a minimal time with more risk in your portfoilo. Like I said you need to get in early on certain new burgeoning sectors or stocks with a low market cap. My favorite right now aside from crypto and alt coins is of course the psychedelic market. (MindMed, ENTBF, etc) Very low market cap in a sector that is only going to change the world as more and more states and countries recognize the power of DMT and the like.
