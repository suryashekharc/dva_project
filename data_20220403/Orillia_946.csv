"The issue I have with this comparison is that it is not just in Orillia that prices are so high, its all across Ont.  Its just over 2M in the GTA, a comparible city to LA.   If you look across the US prices will vary widely depending on the state, as in Canada, places like Saskatoon or Edmonton or Calgary, the average price is about half.

When I was up in Fort Frances I would drive to either Thunderbay or Winnipeg and then fly down to Toronto, occasionally I'd do international falls to Minny then to Toronto.

"I recommend actually coming to Orillia and checking out the neighbourhood in question. The opinions you get here are going to be based on anecdotal evidence and will come with a heavy (if the past is any indication) negative bias. Even hard data such as “houses selling in the 700s” should be less of a priority than what you see with your eyes, and particularly what you are prepared to endure. 

A perfect example of this is that [Charles Pachter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Pachter) owns several houses on Elgin Street. Now he is one of Canada’s most well known contemporary artists. Does that mean that it is a good street to invest in? Right next door to one of Charles’ properties is arguably one of the most questionable houses in Orillia.  What does 700 really mean then?

"If you enjoy sailing and racing or are keen to learn sailing it is quite interesting. The boats have all the same tuning and handling characteristics of a full size sailboat. They behave the same and all of the fundamentals of sailing are applicable. The costs are significantly cheaper then owning a real sailboat however. No mooring/docking/yacht club fees and you can transport the boat to the lake in the back seat of you car.  The Dragonforce 65 (DF65) can be purchased ready to race for about $300 and it's a restricted class. Everyone sails the exact same boat. There is some good videos that others have put together giving you a primer for what the hobby can be and I would highly recommend them:

"Brewery Bay is my undisputed top pick for homemade pub grub, I think they have the best burger in town, their wings are also phenomenal. Studabakers is amazing as well, a bit classier than the Bay, but really at their best during the summer so I'd take advantage of the last few hot days left to enjoy their patio. Sanafir is delicious for sit-down mediterranean. Rustica is amazing Italian food, so is Cosmo's, though both pricey. The Hog n Penny has weekly trivia if that's your scene, otherwise they've got great homemade Irish pub fare. Era 67 is fancy and a bit on the pricier side but really solid. Good greasy pizza isn't really tough to come by but I wouldn't say there's anything in Orillia that's the undisputed top dog for a slice. Depends on your tastes. I personally love 241, but Pizza Nova is decent and so is Pizzaville. Rustica also has pizza but it's classy and authentic so if you want a good greasy slice that's not the place to go. Kensington burger bar is good too. For the bar scene (like, late night bar scene) Studabaker's is best, followed by Fionn MacCool's and Kensington. I'm personally not a huge fan of the food at Fionn's but it's decent enough. The new taco place down at the waterfront in the old Island Princess ferry isn't bad - they're the most authentic tacos in town. Not spectacular, but just good enough and cheap enough for me to say I'd go back. 

For outside the downtown, you have Thai Plate on Memorial which is solid, Theo's is a classic pick for a regular grill-style place, and their pasta is also excellent. In West Ridge a place called the Food Truck opened up fairly recently, which I really liked, great onion rings. Haven't tried State and Main yet, but that's a steakhouse like the Keg. Plenty of good Chinese food in town. I like the Royal Oak, and Gung Ho on West St. near Fittons

If you like boarding sports and fashion, check out Pocket Skate and Vintage and also closer to the lake is Kahuna.

"I live in the south ward and would highly disagree! Just moved here from Toronto in April and love our area. Neighbours are beyond friendly and we are in close distance two THREE beaches (2 biking/walk-in distance and 1 short drive), multiple hiking and biking trails, while being a short drive to all the amenities in the west end. 

Imo the north ward and south ward is the best- close to everything: the west ward is cookie cutter and further removed from the outdoor activities. I’d rather have the beaches closer than the amenities. It makes a difference for me bc the lake has literally become my lifestyle, biking every morning lake to lake before work is a dream. So I guess it depends too what you value. But the south ward is honestly great, no safety concerns at all. 

Before we moved here there was a lot of stigma towards the south ward and maybe that’s from people living longer in orillia holding past judgement but the area has really transformed it seems. There are luxury townhomes across from me and 2 other younger families from Toronto moved in a few houses away.

"My opinion only as a resident:

Best beach area- Mara 

Best swimming- lake couchiching (huge dock for jumping, beautiful scenery in and out of the lake)

Best splash pad (and only)! - tudhope! Lots of kids for this reason, they love it haha 

I go to couchiching the most. Mara can get super crowded and bc it isn’t patrolled as much and you can cook, the litter piles up quick, and it’s a big pet peeve for me when walking the beach personally. I usually go there in the evening when it’s more quiet. Couch is small but never feels crowded. I like to lane swim at couch with there buoy lines. I guess you can do the same as Mara.

"I've been on something similar for about two years now. I am by no means devout or overly strict about it, but I suggest a crock pot, a pressure cooker and a food processor to make your meals immediately easier.

Potatoes and rice are the starches we usually fall to and put the flavour dishes on top. Really quite easy and with a food processor, you can process all your veggies etc in one day, put them in Tupperware and then in your deep freezer until the day of use. Upon the day of use, take out of the freezer in the AM and either directly in your slow cooker or into the fridge for the evening when you're back from work which I'd expect the pressure cooker to be the cooker of choice. Once you're tired of mushy foods, switch it up to a skillet to stir fry!

"Just moved into the south ward from gta. There are  great areas here with lots of young families. I see a lot of stigma towardS the south ward but I’ve been here for 6 months and love it. No safety issues at all (31F- dog got sick last night so was out at 4am walking him and had no worry or fear, very quiet too). So I’m sure there is history with the south ward but the current stigma around it is a bit wierd since it’s great. From my understanding the south ward is going through regentrification so maybe locals (who have lived here for 20+ years) still have that belief compared to the new people moving in here. 

The north seems to have bigger lots than the south and the west is your typical cookie cutter neighbourhood. The south is closer to all the beaches and good out door spots (including couch). Love being walking distance to both couch and tudhope. Endless fun of outdoor activities for kids (and adults!).

"**[Mnjikaning_Fish_Weirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnjikaning_Fish_Weirs)** 
 
 >The Mnjikaning Fish Weirs are one of the oldest human developments in Canada. These fishing weirs were built by the first nations people well before recorded history, dating to around 2500 BC during the Archaic period in North America, according to carbon dating done on some of the wooden remnants. The weirs were built in the narrows between Lake Couchiching and Lake Simcoe, now known as Atherley Narrows, over which Ontario Highway 12 passes today. They were preserved by the water and layers of protective silt.

"I appreciate your post. First, I am incredibly sorry you and your family have experienced this. It isn’t right and it isn’t fair. My background is in public health so I understand the effects of lack of affordable housing but I have not experienced it first hand to your extent. I just want to say that I do recognise my privilege and since moving here I have noticed a gap in income disparity as people most likely from the city are coming here with higher paying jobs and working from home. The last thing I wanted to say is that this housing market has really made things unaffordable for lots of folks and if you asked me last year if I would have moved to orillia I’d be like “what? Probably not!”. It was never on my radar but I also have to live my life the best I can. We were pushed to where we could afford to live as sad as it is. I do not come from a wealthy family and I am not buying an investment property, I am also looking for a place to live and grow and contribute to a community (a beautiful one too I may add). I count my blessings everyday I found a home with my husband in this beautiful community- it is not something I take for granted. We have both felt the effects of this housing market but I absolutely understand that these effects are not equal in anyway as you are experiencing homelessness with your family.

The problem with covid and the mass migrations of gta people out of the city means huge massive real estate market. I’ve lived in orillia my whole life. We were recently evicted due to our landlord trying to capitalize on this soaring market. Leaving us basically homeless. Just like the housing market the renters market is through the roof too. This leaves us with limited options for a whole family. Unfortunately because of people like you are lil city is being gentrified. A lot of families who lived in orillia  there whole lives are being uprooted due to real estate greed and the mass migration north. So do I say welcome to orillia. Hell no. Gentrification is real and no one is safe from the grips of its shadows. My family has been ripped apart from this covid real estate greed bubble.

"I lived in Orillia for twenty-two years and I would say the sketchy areas are Laclie, downtown and South Ward around Shannon and Lankin. North Ward also has its fair share of sketch, such as the crack houses around Fittons and Calverley.

The 'nice' area is definitely the newer developments in West Ridge. I also like the area around Twin Lakes S.S.

"The housing market is really unbelievable right now but after thinking about it a lot, you really can’t time the market. If your in a position to move and your looking for a place to live over the next few years then to me it always seems like a good time! Houses are still very affordable here compared to the GTA madness. I don’t foresee those prices dropping massively which means people will always be looking for affordable homes. 

We found this house honestly on a whim. At first we were reluctant to move to orillia bc it was further than where we were looking (Innisfil, Georgina) but we got priced out quickly and our agent pushed us to look at a house that seemed to fit all our needs (husband needs detached garage for a shop was a big one). There was only one other bidder and we offered what the buyer wanted. Since we felt really good about the house we offered an extra 10k more plus house inspection to seal the deal so we didn’t go much over but she priced it what she was expecting so it’s not like it was a ‘steal’, still at crazy market value at the time for the area. I think if you have a good feeling about it you just gotta to for it. The inspection was huge since all other bids that won on other houses we offered waived inspection. As first time buyers it gave not only an out but a really good understanding of the house. Houses here are older mostly so it’s good to I get the inspection if you can. I can honestly say no regrets. Maybe if we stuck to asking we would have still got it but who knows, it wasn’t worth the risk for us. 

Will have to see how busy the waterfront gets in the summer! Can’t answer that yet haha I just took a bike ride to couchiching beach after work today and it was really Quiet! I’m sure it’ll get busier though

We did buy in the south ward! We did things backwards and looked at the area AFTER which I don’t recommend but we did have the inspection out haha but it turns out we LOVE the area! It’s close to all amenities, close to dtown, it’s close to BOTH beaches and it’s close to the biking trails! I read a lot on reddit too that the south ward is sketchy but after being here for 3 weeks it really isn’t, if anything I’m shocked! So many young families it’s unbelievable. I’m outside right now on my porch in the dark enjoying a drink and I feel completely safe! I walk my dog all around our area and have no hesitations. Some types of homes probably eludes to this idea of sketchy as some are run down and waiting to be flipped or fixed up. But to me that’s just a sign of potential growth. There are still new builds in the area, beautiful brick houses and cute bungalows like ours. Also the level of income may elude to sketchy as you have people who have lived here for 30 years and our generally probably lower income compared to the city. I am assuming but it seems like there is much more blue collar work in this area too. Our neighbours are genuine northerners as they hunt in seasons and build everything themselves. But does this make them unfriendly or weird? Absolutely not! Lower income does not attribute to sketchiness. They are honestly
So lovely. They have offered us tons of help and support! It’s just another way of living since it is not ( or was not ) as expensive to live here compared to the city.

Sorry I am writing a monologue here! Please feel free to dm me if you have any more questions. The final piece I wanted to add was the mental illness and addictions narrative in the south ward and downtown area I read on reddit. I work in this field and have worked dtown Toronto in this highest area of homelessness and in smaller towns like Kenora where drug addiction was in your face everyday walking to work. Mental illness and addictions is in every town but I was shocked to read the level about it here now knowing it is not as in your face as reddit made it seem. Granted I have lived here for 3 weeks but I am more aware of this since it’s my job to support this population. I have not seen homeless people or drug addicts where I live in the south ward. Are there some here? Probably! but that is like in any area anywhere! Even in Richmond hill where i moved from.

Hey! Honestly it’s amazing so far! We are in week 3 so I’m probably still riding a high of even owning a home (first time buyers) but I am appreciating and loving what orillia has to offer! Coming from the GTA it literally feels like everything is minutes away. For example; there are literally 6 huge grocery chains in a less than 10minute drive. Unreal. We are in the south ward so lake and dtown access is minutes away by bike and not to bad of a walk with my dog. I’m so pumped for summer time to bike to get a coffee at lone wolf or mark iv (all excellent coffee places on par with the best from the city !) and just go to the lake in the early morning. Before the rush comes from the gta I guess haha everyone has also been really friendly. From random strangers waiting in line to our neighbours. I am looking forward to meeting more folks as covid restrictions ease 😊 Let me know if you have any other questions!

I feel like this is in every downtown area across Canada haha it just may be more noticeable since orillia is smaller that Toronto for example. I (30f) used to work downtown Toronto in the south east end in cabbage town running a health bus for homeless people. Highest population of homelessness due to the number of shelters but people still bought houses for over 2 million. there’s a lot of stigma with mental illness and addictions but the reality is that the majority really just stick to doing there own thing. It’s important to feel safe but we shouldn’t generalise mental illness and addictions to something bad or dangerous. That’s how the stigma grows. Real estate prices will certainly not be impacted by this from my experience as well.

"Congrats! and Welcome. I'm a born and raised Orillian and gutted to have to move out of town for a few years (but its for a good job so not all bad news ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )

Coffee is world class at Lone Wolf or Mark IV brothers. 

Food, as already mentioned, The Common Stove is the current pinnacle for a proper dining experience in town. Rustica Pizza Vino is also outstanding for a true Neapolitan pizza experience. There are  lots of others downtown, shine, eclectic cafe, brewery bay, Kensington's, apple Annies cafe is a nice spot for lunch (coffee isn't half bad, but doesn't compare to LW or Mk4) and Mariposa is an obvious staple for newcomers to town. its a landmark for sure.

Orillia is awesome. Summer or winter there are a myriad of things to do. With the lakes, the parks and the local infrastructure for things like hiking or mountain biking / XC skiing you'll have a hard time being bored. And the best part geographically is you're (+/\_) and hour for all the major stuff, airport, Muskoka, wasaga, blue mountian.. its all an hour away!

First spots to take the doggo would be Scout Valley or Grants Woods. then venture into Silver Creek Tract and start looking at the other local infrastructure the Simcoe County Mountain Bike Club has established. their trail system is spectacular and hiker friendly.

"Welcome! And for things to do in the summer, if you're the active sorts, there's services for renting kayaks around the lakes (which are safe to swim in) and nice walking trails up in scout's valley, and on the other side of the town in southward by james street, there's other nice walking trails that are pet friendly.

We have an antique car show in the summer that's a must see, and the tour boat on the lake is a nice ride, but i like to catch it if there's a performer (like craig cardiff) doing a set on it. For some more adult oriented fun, casino rama is just outside of town and hosts alot of performances and events (in more normal times) and in between us and barrie there's an event ground that hosts festivals like boots and hearts, and veld. There's also a few pool halls around town, and the YMCA is great for swimming obviously. And i think we recently built a rec centre too?

For coffee, i cant seem to think of somewhere other than mariposa that i really enjoy that isn't a chain, but for food, there's lots of must try places. Our most upscale destination is probably era 67 on mississauga street, but brewery bay is a must. It's a down to earth restaurant run by our very own mayor Steve Clarke! Hard to get more Orillia than that. But my personal favourite location in town is rustica, a nice, stone oven pizzeria that is far better in quality and atmosphere than I'd ever expect a pizza place to be. And, small town, it's owned and operated by Steve Clarke's daughter. So be sure to mention you're new here and either owner and staff will most definitely make you feel welcome.

Right! Things to do in winter. We have a santa claus parade and they make big snow/ice sculptures down by the beach. There's plenty of hills in this town for little ones to toboggan on, but for winter themed things to do, consider investing in some ski/snowboarding equipment, because horseshoe valley is like, 20 minutes out of town and horshoe resort has some great hills for beginner up to at least black diamond level ski/snowboarders.

And some advice about the weather, you'd think it cant be that different, being so close to Toronto, but we're in a snow belt, so we get lots of snow, and when it rains, it really rains. So make sure if you have to go anywhere in the winter you get out your shovel or snowblower early enough before you have to leave. And the summers can get pretty hot, so make sure you have a decent AC unit, and if not, a few window units is a must. 

Feel free to shoot me a message with any other questions and if i can't answer them myself, I'll field them to family and friends. -hope this helps!",t2_4dpj4ve6,whiplashMYQ,0,1615418410.0,0,t1_gqi9hfd,gqi9hfd,True,Dependent_Nobody_188,t3_m2are7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Orillia/comments/m2are7/moving_to_orillia/,Moving to ORILLIA!!!,/r/Orillia/comments/m2are7/moving_to_orillia/gqi9hfd/,5,r/Orillia,0,5

Ahhh yes trust me the housing prices affects all first time buyers, everyone is essentially being pushed more north/east/west as they get priced out. It was so sad to see 20 offers on the table and seeing more than half were contractors or investors. It’s tough to see that in any community.

"No. Absolutely not. Ive lived in many cities throughout Ontario, and this is by far one of the most backwards towns ive ever seen. Proportionately, the problems are a little unbalanced compared to other cities. There are Lots of rich, retired, conservative folks, and surplus of poor folks often clearly addicted to drugs. Further more, there is a lack of jobs but real estate is outrageous, becoming comparable the price of the cities. There is just an ironic disproportion of money here. Years ago, a mental health hospital in town closed down , now many citizens are wandering without care on the streets. Drugs are a huge problem and violence is ramping up. Homelessness is also huge. And it feels like one of those places where ""somethings in the water...."" its a weird place. The rich dont care about the poor. Locals are seriously weird. And theres nothing to do in the city. Depressing because yes , the summers are gorgeous and absolutely lovely. But it really isnt vibrant, its so uninteresting and if you really speak to the locals theres a high level of racism, bigotry and ignorance toward real world problems.

">I guess all those Cubans risking their lives to cross the ocean on homemade rafts to get to the US don’t know what they’re missing ;)

Emigration is an expected reaction to massive changes in power structure. Happens regularly in civil wars, revolts, or contested changes of power. The ones in power and those that agree with them feel threatened and leave. Emigration itself is not a sign of merrit or demerit in a system, it's just a sign of forceful change.

"It is a really lovely place to raise a family.  When we moved here 11 years ago I was against the idea of settling in the area (prior to living here I lived in Seoul for 5 years and prior to that in Montreal for 10), but without question I couldn’t be happier that we have. 

We own a house down the street from Lake Couchiching that was 1/4 the price of my sister’s house in Ajax that is located nowhere near anything noteworthy.

Throughout the pandemic I kept on hearing about how horrific is was elsewhere for this reason and that, while we were hanging out on the beach. In the summer we often swim in a different lake every day. In the winter we are skating on the lake whenever we can. 

There has recently been something of a renaissance for young entrepreneurs here. Mississaga Street, for example, has many new delicious award winning restaurants, like Eclectic Café and The Common Stove. The Refillery District is redefining grocery stores. The Holding Space is a stunning yoga studio that focuses on prenatal, mom and baby and kids yoga. 

There are so many reasons why Orillia has tonnes of potential. 

Without skirting around the issue, Orillia also has a economically depressed section of the population that is eating itself and desperately requires attention. This isn’t unique to Orillia, but because of some social programs that are available here (specifically at Soldiers Memorial Hospital) many individuals with special needs find themselves here with nowhere to call a home. This is a problem. Often when you hear of people who have a negative view of Orillia, it is from people who have lived here all their lives and have never gone even south of Barrie. This lack of perspective results in those individuals not having a clear understanding of how amazing it really is here. 

That notwithstanding, I am always encouraging friends of mine to consider living here.

"Wow, just had a look at Orillia listings and man have things dried up.  The last time we looked at rentals, we just checked [Realtor.ca](https://Realtor.ca) and contacted the agent for the property we liked the most.

"Hey! I'm a little late to the party but I'm in a similar boat... I moved here a bit before the pandemic started, but I didn't really make any friends pre-pandemic and I'm really starting to feel the isolation. So, feel free to DM me if you ever feel like chatting!
