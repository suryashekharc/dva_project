I don't see any reason you can't start with private services then switch once approved, but it's a good question to ask the initial service coordinator (who sets up your evaluations) and I would also try to find a provider that also participates with EI so you don't have to switch midstream.",t2_2yu8hbzd,ms10701,0,1649009552.0,0,t1_i391uog,i391uog,True,musicmerchkid,t3_tveod2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tveod2/any_advice_regarding_ei_early_intervention_in/,Any advice regarding EI (early intervention) in Westchester County,/r/Westchester/comments/tveod2/any_advice_regarding_ei_early_intervention_in/i391uog/,1,r/Westchester,0,1

">I’m closer to the Scarsdale station, so I park at the Eastchester lot on Grayrock and walk a few minutes to the station. The wait for a space was only a couple of months back in 2018 and there are a lot less cars, so there might be availability now. It’s $780 for the year, but you can pay quarterly. Previously I had parked at the Scarsdale freightway station which is much more convenient, but last time I checked it was around $1700 a year for a non-Scarsdale resident.

>If you’re interested in the Grayrock lot, call Eastchester’s town clerk. Mary, who handles parking has always been really helpful. The Scarsdale clerk’s office is a different story.

"This is a very complicated question. Statistically, you make more than many Americans, but not much for NYC. It's a hard truth, but NYC and real estate for the surrounding area is insane right now. If you go on Zillow, don't look at listings more than 9 days old, because those places are already gone. Also, everything that looks nice is selling for much higher than listing price. There is actually a nationwide housing shortage. The pandemic held up construction and renovations. I just bid on a 3 BR house in NJ listed for $639k that just sold in 5 days for $1.1 million, and it needed work. You probably already know this, but don't forget to calculate the price of property taxes, heating and water bills, interest on that mortgage (over 4.1% at current mortgage rates), and closing costs. For a condo, co-op, or townhome, you also have HOA fees, which vary greatly. Westchester will also mean you will likely need a car, car insurance and current gas prices. I know that's all a lot to take in, but if you keep your eyes on the housing market, you might be able to buy a place and sell it for more money in a few years. However, if you buy now you likely will lose money if you sell in less than 10 years, because the market is overinflated. 2024 might be a great time to buy as current buyers go through foreclosures and construction catches up.

"It depends on what the house goes for, but apparently the house has been listed/delisted 2x the past year and listing price dropped around 100k. The currently assessed price is about the listing but the assessment in 2020 was 730k and 2021 was 820k (based on 2019-2020 data), so one can argue that that valuation is too high as it doesnt account for the insane market movements in the past 18 months.

Greenburgh was unique in that they seem to reassess every 5 years after a major overhaul of the process in 2016.  They did another reassessment in 2021, they use a company called tyler technologies to run the data and apparently it seems like a decent methodology to make sure houses are comparable (ie: i read somewhere they even take into account whether they have a Hudson river view).

"I live in a different town in westchester so not 100% sure of greenburgh specifics. First, I’m sure you can correct the town data, and that there is a process for that. Second, while the new square footage could affect your assessment, it is not necessarily automatic and you might have to grieve your taxes. However, if you are just coming in to buy a property at $XXX, you might have trouble convincing the committee that you are overassessed, if your purchase price is greater than the assessed value. Finally, not sure about greenburgh specifically but many municipalities will increase assessments up to the purchase price upon an arms length sale. So your taxes might actually be going up.

"Stone Barns in Tarrytown is a functioning farm that has a number of animals including pigs and it’s a beautiful property to walk through. They are always moving the animals’ enclosures around the land so you can ask the staff where the pigs are located when you get there. They usually have the moms and babies together in one enclosure and then a large male or two elsewhere on the property, if i’m remembering correctly. 
They do not have a petting zoo though. 
You can bring a picnic lunch with you or they have a small cafe with a limited but tasty menu too if you don’t want to bring your own food.

"Applied to Hackley this year for both of my children.  Both got waitlisted.  One was going into an open enrollment year (2nd grade), the other was going into first grade, which head of admissions explained after getting waitlisted, only had one open space and they were only accepting a male student at this time to keep ratio fairly even.  Admissions said that due to covid they’ve had a huge increase in applications, so naturally the competition is tighter.  They did my children’s interviews via zoom (neither of my kids had ever used zoom, so that was a bit of a bummer).  Overall, what drew our family to Hackley was their commitment to engaging students in a well rounded way.  There is a large focus on academics, of course, but they also stress health/wellness, and all of the arts.  Just a piece of advice that I would’ve liked to receive prior to moving out here from Long Island City - do your best not to move into an area whose public schools you wouldn’t want to send your child to because you’re optimistic about getting them into a private school.

"Gonna break this down.

NYS Doc fees are CAPPED at $175, Anything outside of that like a prep fee or other bullshit are additions. The dealer/doc fee itself is $175. It was $75 for years and finally got up'd cause every other state can charge more. Anything outside of the $175 is negotiable/removable.

To all the no dealer/doc fee from sales, they are just trying to get you into the door.

For them not accepting any 3rd party payments (Credit union or pre approvals) I'd just walk. FYI if you had a pre approval you should have just been able to get the bill of sale from the dealer and call them and get a check from a local branch or have them overnight it to you.

There's a reason I stopped buying locally, not worth my trouble dealing with dealers around here. I buy $300k cars and it shouldn't take me more then an hour or two max to buy a $30k car or deal with bullshit.

"I’m not surprised at the comments regarding Yonkers. The area has drastically changed for the better. 

If we want to talk about crime/drug use, let’s talk about it. As someone who lived in Bronxville and hated it, you find the same amount of happenings except it’s all behind white picket fences and closed doors. I did the river towns for a bit (Hastings & Irvington) and the amount of questionable characters I met was interesting.

Yes the schools may be better and if you have children then I’d suggest Tarrytown, but I thought it was hilarious as how many adults did/do drugs and cheat on their spouses — there is a reason suburban stereotypes exist. Don’t even get me started on the drunk driving.

Scenario 2: house above 700k, children and one of them needs daycare, then you’re talking 250-300k.

I don't have tints now (wasn't worth the hassle to me anymore) but when I did I'd go months never getting pulled over and then times where I would get stopped multiple times a month.

"First, I'm with you on Central AC, my house has it and I love it. But this is one of those questions that is basically impossible to answer as it is highly situational. Biggest factors are if there is a basement, how many stories there are, if there's an attic, etc.

Adding a true central AC system is going to require ductwork. How that ductwork is done, again, is highly situational. If you're on a one story ranch and there's unfinished basement, this shouldn't be too hard! But obviously different on colonial built on a slab. Another thing to consider here: if it was easy to add central AC to the house you're considering, it probably would have already been done. In most cases, you either run the system from the basement and ductwork up (most common in this area) or from the attic and ductwork down (more common in the South and places where there are no basements), but again, situational.

Anyhow, the difficulty of how and where to run the ductwork and returns etc. factors into it quite a bit. If there's no obviously way to do it you will lose some space. It's usually a fairly extensive project which I can't imagine could be done for sub-$20k especially in this environment. You're going to spend at least $10k just for the condenser and furnace, easily. I'm guessing a lot of quotes for a typical situation would be around $25k-30k, although again, I'm guessing here.

Mini splits are a bit different and you might be able to get an easier estimate on those as you may be able to find someone who will quote you an average per unit install rate (ex. $3k for each unit installed and you need 5, BTW I'm making these numbers up because I have no idea how much mini splits are, just that you don't have to deal with whole ductwork hassles).

I kind of made central AC a requirement when buying and ended up getting an house that already had it (although I did end up doing additional HVAC work which is why I'm a little knowledgeable now). I did consider adding it to another house we nearly made an offer on but not surprisingly I couldn't even get anyone to make a ballpark quote considering I didn't own the house (and this was pre-pandemic when things were easier).

"Gilligan's Pier in Newburgh MD - Randomly came across this place once driving back, it could be a day 1 lunch/dinner stop depending on itinerary; ~6-7hrs away. Nice little local seafood joint on the Potomac. South of DC, you'd be detouring off 95 (no idea if this was done for traffic reasons or just for variety but was close enough to the chosen route that it came up in a quick lunch search).

Food was nice enough, not a conventional tourist destination by any stretch but the memorable thing about it was that out back there was a bizarrely out of place little beach with a themed tiki bar complete with palm trees. It felt like a minor Twilight Zone experience; ""Wait... palm trees don't grow this far north, right? We've been driving in the right direction, right?"". Not like, little ones in pots either. Legit looked like a Florida beach.

Apparently they've got a guy who trucks them in every year and replants. Which sounded nuts, but alright. I have no idea if this is a completely unique phenomenon or not (and I suppose no guarantee that it's always done up to the same degree depending on year/season) but it made for a fun little memory.

"Have lived here for six years and love it, although we are soon moving (very bittersweet). It’s definitely a small town where it’s easy to get to know your neighbors and see the same friendly faces around. There’s a lot of pride in the town and community with regular parades, fairs, events. 

It’s got some great restaurants and shops, but it’s not extensive, however town sorta bleeds right into Dobbs Ferry so there are always additional options a mile away. Antoinette’s roasts the best coffee in Westchester and bake all their own pastries in-house.  

There is a lot of musical people, but if you’re looking for a band to be playing at the bar there aren’t many options for it anymore (RIP Roadhouse and The Mill). That said, you may bump into a jazz quartet on the lawn outside the library.

There are two versions of HoH: Those who have lived here there whole lives and go back a few generations. And then those who recently moved here from Brooklyn to start a family.

If you don't have to move immediately there is 1 Clinton Park. It's just about done, but they are starting to lease now. This is 1 of a 2 building development with a pedestrian plaza in between.

"It's definitely worth taking a trip and having a look around. Vibrant music scene might be a generous term.

"Some thoughts:
* Rosie’s Bistro takes down its outdoor seating during colder months. It’s not an option now.
* Underhill Crossing is in an enclosed shelter with an open wall. It’s fine as long as it’s not too crowded. Tre’dici Social is similar in setup. Scalini Osteria has an outdoor alley and a true outdoor setup, but no one ever sits in the latter. La Casa Bronxville has an outdoor shelter with individual booths, too.
* If you’re coming on a Tuesday night, you’ll generally be fine anywhere. None of the outdoor restaurants get that busy. Busiest time will be 6-8.
* As things start to warm up, you’ll have more options. Coals just put out their tables, but have no heat lamps. If they’re open outside, their tables are well spaced out. Il Bacio (Italian) or Haiku (Asian bistro) would work when they’re outdoors, too. 
* That said, you can’t go wrong with a picnic on the Bronx River Pathway. Just check the weather first, as it is a flood plain and can get muddy after a legit storm.

"**An excerpt from True Allegiance, by Ben Shapiro:**


Then he heard the voice.

   “Hey, pig,” it said. The voice wasn’t deep. It was the voice of a child. And the
kid stood outside the door of the quick mart, legs spread, arms hanging down by
his sides. A cute black kid, wearing a Simpsons T-shirt and somebody’s old
Converse sneakers and baggy jeans.

   On his hip, stuck in those baggy jeans, was a pistol.

   It looked like a pistol, anyway. But O’Sullivan couldn’t see clearly. The light
wasn’t right. He could see the bulge, but not the object.

   O’Sullivan put his flashlight back in his belt and put his hand back on his
pistol, the greasy handle still warm to the touch.

   “Stop right there, pig,” the kid said. His hand began to creep down toward his
waistband.

   O’Sullivan pulled the gun out of its holster, leveling it at the kid. “Put your
hands above your head. Do it now!”

   “Fuck you, honky,” the kid shot back. “Get the fuck out of my neighborhood.”
Then he laughed, a cute kid’s laugh. O’Sullivan looked for sympathy behind
those eyes, found none.

   Oh, shit, O’Sullivan thought. Then he said, “Hands up. Right now.”

   The kid laughed again, a musical tinkling noise. “You ain’t gonna shoot me,
pig. What, you afraid of a kid?”

   O’Sullivan could feel every breath as it entered his lungs. “No, kid, I don’t
want to shoot you,” he said. “But I need you to cooperate. Put your hands above
your head. Right now.”

   The kid’s hand shifted to his waistband again. O’Sullivan’s hands began to
shake.

   “Get the fuck out of my neighborhood,” the kid repeated.

   O’Sullivan looked around stealthily. Still nobody on the street. Totally empty.
The sweat on his forehead felt cold in the night air. In the retraining sessions at
the station, they’d told officers to remember the nasty racial legacy of the
department, be aware of the community’s justified suspicion of police. Right
now, all O’Sullivan was thinking about was getting this kid with the empty eyes
to back the fuck off.

   “Go on home,” he said.

   “You go home, white boy,” said the kid. His hand moved lower.

   Suddenly, O’Sullivan’s head filled with a sudden clarity, his brain with a
preternatural energy. He recognized the feel of the adrenaline hitting. He wasn’t
going to get shot on the corner of Iowa and Van Dyke outside a shitty
convenience store in a shitty town by some eight-year-old, bleed out in the gutter
of some city the world left behind. He had a life, too.

   The gun felt alive in his hand. The gun was life.

   The muzzle was aimed dead at the kid’s chest. No way to miss, with the kid
this close, just ten feet away maybe. Still cloaked in the shadow of the gas
station overhang.

   “Kid, I’m not going to ask you again. I need you to put your hands on top of
your head and get on your knees.”

   “Fuck you, motherfucker.”

   “I’m serious.”

   The kid’s hand was nearly inside his waistband now.

   “Don’t do that,” O’Sullivan said.

   The kid smiled, almost gently.

   “Don’t.”

   The kid’s smile broadened, the hand moved down into the pants. “Get the
fuck out of my hood,” the kid cheerfully repeated. “I’ll cap your ass.”

   “Kid, I’m warning you,” O’Sullivan yelled. “Put your hands above your head!
Do it now…”

   The roar shattered the night air, a sonic boom in the blackness. The shot blew
the kid off his feet completely, knocked him onto his back.

   O’Sullivan reached for his radio, mechanically reported it: “Shots fired,
officer needs help at the gas station on Iowa and Van Dyke.”

   “Ohgodohgodohgodohgod,” O’Sullivan repeated as he moved toward the
body, the smoke rising from his Glock. He pointed it down at the kid again, but
the boy wasn’t moving. The blood seeped through Homer Simpson’s face,
pooled around the kid’s lifeless body. The grin had been replaced with a look of
instantaneous shock. His hand had fallen out of his waistband with the force of
the shooting.

   In it was a toy gun, the tip orange plastic.

   For a brief moment, O’Sullivan couldn’t breathe. When he looked up, he saw
them coming. Dozens of them. The citizens of Detroit, coming out of the
darkness, congregating. He could feel their eyes.

   Officer Ricky O’Sullivan sat down on the curb and began to cry.

"Hi, I’m in Hastings on Hudson. I’ll try to answer as many of your questions as I can remember. 

I guess it’s a hip town in a suburban kind of way. We moved here the year before the pandemic (2019? I can’t remember) so I’m not too aware of the music scene but I have been seeing some social media posts about local musicians performing at the local coffee shop and I know quite a few residents play one kind of musical instrument or another, myself included. I guess that counts as a music scene. I would love to see more bands playing around town. 

I’ve never been to Edgemont I can’t comment on how much more or less diverse Hastings is but on the grand scheme of things its not super diverse. That said, for what it’s worth it’s getting more diverse. It was a white working class town (read into that what you will) until, I think, about 20 or 30 years ago when the factory that made mustard gas or something shut down. 

There is no Starbucks or big box stores, there are a good selection of mom and pop shops and restaurants in the downtown area. When we need to visit a big box store we go to Central Ave in Yonkers, they have have most of them. 

It is comparable to Dobbs Ferry, I think Dobbs might be a little bigger and the downtown area is definitely bigger. 

The school district here is great and they have really great services for neuro-diverse kids which we love because our older guy needs some…actually all of those services. 

I’m guessing from your questions you haven’t visited yet. You really should come look around. It’s pretty walkable so if you’re moving up from NYC you don’t need to get a car right away if you don’t walk. The commuter train service is pretty good also.",t2_3cr6k2mz,gramps666,0,1647902878.0,0,t1_i1la5ws,i1la5ws,True,__BearHug__,t3_tjncjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tjncjn/tell_me_about_hastings_on_hudson/,Tell me about Hastings on Hudson!,/r/Westchester/comments/tjncjn/tell_me_about_hastings_on_hudson/i1la5ws/,8,r/Westchester,0,8

"I lived in Tuckahoe (very near Sagamore, as it happens) back in high school and it's a fantastic little town. I almost moved back a couple of years ago, in fact. It's actually come a LONG way in the last couple of decades, with a ton of revitalization of downtown and Main Street, as well as the old Revlon factory across the tracks, bringing in a good amount of tax revenue to the town that was missing during most of the late Eighties and Nineties. Despite having a train station the town still lacks a cool ""town square"", but it has great parks and sports fields, the Bronx River walking/biking path, solid schools (a ton better than when I went there!) and easy access to highways, country clubs like Lake Isle, NYC, White Plains and Central Ave. There aren't and never have been safety or crime issues anywhere in the town, unless you count the [Scripps Heiress murder back in 1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Scripps), right down the road from where you're looking to move.

"I've got a 1600 sqft. 3 bed/2bath  house built in 1940. Not very efficient windows or insulation, gas furnace,  cast iron hot water radiators, gas dryer, electric stove.  We keep the temp at 66-69°. Feb. 8th through Mar. 10 (coldest month) we (family of 4) used 125 Therms ($282).  I doubt use of gas stove would bring that usage cost up to $500. Seems like something isn't right.

Good rules to use: 
Stop and look both ways, listen for a train whistle. Open your window. Tell the tester why you do that. 
Never stop on the tracks, ever.

I am the original Highlands responder from earlier today. 10605 does cover a few neighborhoods, one being the Highlands. We have many beautiful neighborhoods here in WP and it’s a great family oriented area to raise kids. We do have 5 elementary schools (I never said they were all in the Highlands). My child went to Church Street which is across town but was a wonderful experience. I know families at all schools and all have had wonderful experiences.The Rocky Dell area is closest to the Ridgeway Elementary School. 

I never said Rooster Market was a coffee shop although they have excellent coffee. It’s a small local deli where everyone knows each other. A wonderful little local spot. But plenty of coffee shops like Hastings, Araras, WFM, Starbucks and Dunkin’ are all close by. 

I recommend the local WP Moms page on Fb. You can search and find lots of info on the neighborhood you are looking at and the schools nearby.

Yeah the taxes are high but I think as a percentage they are in line with lots of other places. Would be lying if I said it wasn't a bitter pill to swallow.

Food / etc. Not a huge amount of choice walking but I think in southern Westchester the relative density means a 5-10 minute drive has lots of different choices. Not discounting but I wouldn't use as basis for comparison. Even if you can walk to 1/2 places there's another dozen you still need to drive to.

Stop into Roosters Market on Gedney Way and you will get the perfect feel of the locals. We have 5 elementary schools all of which are wonderful.

"Your employer cannot take any action against you for missing work due to Jury Duty, but you should let them know ASAP of course.

Don't worry about dressing up, just wear something clean, not vulgar/offensive, and comfortable. There is no coat-check, so if you bring one, or a bag, you'll be carrying it with you through the day.

You're going to White Plains, yeah? If you're driving, park in the all-day parking at the Galleria Mall a block away. Bring a physical book/newspaper/magazine. They will confiscate your phone when you enter the courthouse. Wear comfortable shoes, because you could be standing for quite a while before you get inside. Even if you show up, like, an hour before you're supposed to arrive there will be people in line already. Don't sweat not getting into the building by the time on the card, just be on line.

From there, just follow instructions. You'll fill out some forms, you'll watch some videos made in, like, 1990 about the importance of Jury Duty. Then you'll sit until your name is called. You will probably be either picked or dismissed by the end of the day, but you *may* be told you'll need to stay late if jury selection is still ongoing, and you *may* even be asked to come back on another date (they only do jury selection on certain days of the week). If you're picked, you'll be led to a different room where you'll be questioned to see if the prosecutors and defense attorneys are okay with you being on that jury. You'll also have an opportunity to give a reason you should be excused from Jury Duty, but be aware they are *really* strict about what they allow - basically, you need to own a business you cannot be away from or be *absolutely essential* at home or work to be excused.

 If you're picked for a jury, they'll give you the start date of the trial and possibly some idea of how long it's expected to last. Again, your boss cannot take action against you because of this. They don't have to pay you, though, but you will be paid by the Court ($50/day if memory serves, check mailed to you after you complete your duty). If you are dismissed (not chosen and not told to come back another day), you're clear for the next five years.",t2_7gso6,TheCheshireCody,0,1647464961.0,0,t1_i0xnvsb,i0xnvsb,True,ImmediateAttitude218,t3_tfk3b9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/tfk3b9/just_got_a_jury_duty_summons_what_should_i_expect/,Just got a jury duty summons.. what should I expect?,/r/Westchester/comments/tfk3b9/just_got_a_jury_duty_summons_what_should_i_expect/i0xnvsb/,6,r/Westchester,0,6

Yup you were right. Unfortunately White Plains cops aren’t going to bother even with a partial plate. Won’t even bother reviewing cameras. So much for that.

"My dad, brother, and I would always come here once or even twice every week growing up. We even bought ""custom"" slot cars that I still have until this day. My dad passed 10 years ago, but the memories I have here with and of him are something that I will have and cherish until the day I die. Thanks so much for posting this and the unexpected nostalgia.

Slot cars, Sport Time, ice skating, mini golf, and movies (also the occasional visit to Sam's Club which was torture as a kid).
