"Per an energy/metals analyst I follow, and before the lefties get bent out of shape, keep in mind he's a Democrat...

>It's not like I didn't expect it, but there are LOTS of *really stupid* energy ideas emanating from this administration of late. The latest of which is this SPR crude oil release, which every economist knows will *increase* demand at a time when supply is short by way more than 1M barrels/day...SMDH.
>
>But the idea that Democratic party leadership keeps dangerously doubling down on is that renewables are somehow the best solution to energy independence. In their current state, that is nothing more than a fairy tale told to people who don't know better and can't do math.
>
>So let's do the math.
>
>The world consumes 25,000 TW hours of electricity per year. That translates to 25 billion megawatt hours (MWh) per year, which would require about 12 million MW of installed solar/wind capacity.
>
>Fossil fuel generated power, on the other hand, has a higher capacity factor and can dispatch 24/7, so the current 4+ million MW of installed capacity produces nearly two thirds of the world's electricity. Replacing this - which is the ultimate goal of the energy transition - requires 9 million MW of renewables.
>
>9 million MW of solar to replace fossil fuels requires 504 million tons of steel, 45 million tons each of copper & silicone (27 million tons of coal & 270 million tons CO2 & CO) for starters.
>
>9 million MW of wind would require 2.7 billion tons of iron, 4.5 billion tons of concrete, 81 million tons of plastic, 90 million tons of special minerals & 45-90 million tons of copper. And it would require 900,000 square miles of land - much of which will displace farms and forests. 
>
>All of these materials (which comprise 80% of CAPEX to build and operate) are already in dangerously short supply - for instance, the world only mines about 20 million tonnes of copper in any given year (chart 1), and demand is already outpacing supply (chart 2). As a result, prices for these commodities are up a *minimum* of 50% over the past year (coal, which is needed to smelt iron and silicon is up ~400% - more than bitcoin!)
>
>And this is even before addressing the Electric Vehicle market, battery metals, rare earths, or realizing that by 2050, that 9 million MW of renewable gen has to become 24 million MW.
>
>Simply put, there does not exist enough material in the world to acheive these goals that are being set out by non-experts. 
>
>To even get close will require ***trillions of dollars*** in mining finance, which will need to be deployed NOW, as it takes 7-10 years to build one of these diesel-consuming, CO2-emitting mines. 
>
>Oh and a lot of those deposits will be in non-ESG friendly countries that pollute massively or are bad geopolitical actors (like Russia and China, for instance).
>
>It's an impossible goal.
>
>Literally the only way I can model out to 2040 (when battery storage is slated to arrive at grid scale) without breaking one of these commodity markets is to lean heavily on nuclear energy and natgas/carbon capture. And that's not just my conclusion either - every single analyst with whom I've spoken (about 15 so far, mostly liberals, btw) encounters similar problems.
>
>So real talk: progressive politicians better wake up to this reality soon, or power prices are going to start looking a lot like Germany's (chart 3)...that ain't exactly a good recipe for winning elections.
>
>END RANT.
>
>TL;DR We don't have enough stuff to do the energy things everybody wants to do - so says math.

"Coal to make building materials? That sounds wild lol, I’ll have to look into that. I disagree with the sentiment coal is dead however. There are two different types of coal, thermal and metallurgical. Metallurgical coal is used to make steel and is currently the only way to make steel so unless we find an alternative, we will always need met coal. Thermal coal is used to make energy and the price of thermal coal hit an all time high earlier this month. It quickly went down as coal price is highly irregular, but I wouldn’t call it dying. The biggest threats to the WV coal industry is the WV natural gas industry which can produce cleaner and cheaper energy, the Wyoming coal industry where they have 100’ seams on the surface and can mine and ship coal for cheap, and environmental regulations. That’s not to say all those things are bad, most are really good things like environment regulations and burning natural gas instead of coal, but WV coal will still have a place for a long time. In the mean time, we should focus on the communities which weren’t as lucky and had their one and only industry shut down.",t2_epyri77,overlord0101,0,1648920612.0,0,t1_i34oxzm,i34oxzm,False,Geek-Haven888,t3_tuj148,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/tuj148/west_virginia_releases_52page_report_on_the/,"West Virginia releases 52-page report on the cost-competitive benefits of growing a regional renewable energy economy, and why ramping up renewable energy beats dependence on coal",/r/WestVirginia/comments/tuj148/west_virginia_releases_52page_report_on_the/i34oxzm/,-7,r/WestVirginia,0,-7

"From Moundsville originally but also lived in Wheeling.   Both towns had DiCarlos (or more than one).  As a kid, I loved it when my Dad would bring home DiCarlos at like 1AM on his way home from afternoon shift at the chemical plant.  Just something about it hit the spot.  The DiCarlos in Glen Dale was an absolute dump.  No one wore gloves or anything.  Heck, they probably stirred the sauce with their arm down in the bucket.  As an adult, I could never understand why I had to call an hour before I went and then wait another hour to get it.  It seemed like the most disorganized place most of the time.  For the younger crowd, it was a hang out spot and underage drinking also took place...but as adult, I just wanted to eat!  It's OK, but not worth a two hour wait IMHO.  DeFelice is also good but I'd say it is a way different type of pizza than DiCarlos.

"> This post does do that thing where they seem to imagine the place being some unpeopled frontier.  I think WV people have a thing about being unseen, maybe that is what chaps me.

Exactly, I feel the same. We’ve had such a bad reputation for so long, created by outsiders. No questioning why we were exploited, or why things might be the way they are here.

"I think the precision of my typing was spot on. The letters that I intended to use are accurately displayed in terms of order and spacing. 

Perhaps, it is the precision in the actual use of the language that could be better....I am not convinced that it is a ""typing"" issue, as you suggest.

Again, I urge you to consider use of your context clues. It does require a cursory understanding of meterology in the general sense...but nothing more than a layman would know.

I suggested that there is something to consider in relation to elevation and also that it tends to snow there early and that the snow may stay around longer. Putting these two clues together should lead you to a good hypothesis regarding my intended meaning.

Also, to misread my words to suggest that I was saying that ALL of this county is either higher or lower than ALL of the surrounding area would be an erroneous assumption. Often times,we must deal in generalities. I did so with my original post . I am sorry that the subtleties escaped you.

"Congrats on the inheritance and I hope you enjoy and work to maintain the beauty. I also support the idea of letting the forest stand. Any remaining primary forest/ old growth areas may be home to unique species. The forest alone provides valuable ecosystem services in that the trees remove and store atmospheric CO2, reduce erosion, protect soil nutrients, reduce flooding, and produce oxygen. The trees are more of an asset in the long term health of the environment than they would be for the short term benefits to your family wealth.

"It really depends what you’re looking for. 

For outdoor rec and “the wv experience” I recommend Fayetteville, Oak Hill, or Beckley.

For close to DC, Charlestown.

For under the radar, Snow Shoe.

For city life and ease of transition, Charleston.

For small town with quick access to resources, somewhere on the outskirts of Huntington (think Point Pleasant region). 

For true rural, wirt, Calhoun, and gilmer county.

For industrial with quick access to other states, Wheeling.

Then there’s Ripley, Ravenswood, Parkersburg, and Vienna. This is *kinda* the mid-Ohio valley. I lived there once and I don’t really recommend it just due to the lack of resources.

STAY AWAY FROM, Boone County and Hinton.

Also, if you have children or plan to have children, I definitely recommend Charleston or down around Beckley, that way they can either get a good grade school education or commute to wvu tech should they go to college.",t2_5qzlp7l1,AdventureEngineer,0,1648717193.0,0,t1_i2tqlo3,i2tqlo3,True,burstintoflames,t3_ts9tgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/ts9tgs/what_cities_would_you_recommend_to_someone_moving/,What cities would you recommend to someone moving to West Virginia?,/r/WestVirginia/comments/ts9tgs/what_cities_would_you_recommend_to_someone_moving/i2tqlo3/,2,r/WestVirginia,0,2

Of course you are since you don’t have to be here to see our natural beauty ruined by those hideously ugly things.

Also, you probably won’t be worried about the drop in property values of everyone around your little wind farm - and of those whose views are ruined.

"For what it's worth I'm in South Charleston and my internet is way better than when I was living in a somewhat sketchy neighborhood in a much, much larger city.

Also, if you're moving from DC. Probably just go for the Eastern panhandle. You'll still pretty much be on the east cost corridor. My other pick would be Morgantown, pretty much your standard college town. Also, someone suggested Elkins. Elkins is a really cool little place.

Of course you aren't going to get fiber or cable out in the middle of nowhere, that's just common sense. Second, the vast majority of teleworkers simply do not need gig or better speeds to perform their job functions. I spend 8 hour shifts connected to govt VPN (which seriously hampers my bandwidth), while also connecting to a VM and running a remote support tool on about ~100Mbs down, average.

"As a coronary patient of WVU in Martinsburg (and resident of M'burg), was underwhelmed with the coronary doctors (and other doctors) and also how unhappy the nurses & staff were.  To me a good hospital has nurses & support staff that are at least neutral to happy not sullen.  Doctors should not make you feel that you are an ATM to feed their lifestyle - constantly ordering tests of dubious value, etc.  These are small things that tell a patient a lot about the hospital and who they hire if you are listening,

About a year ago switched to Winchester Medical Center in Winchester, VA (20 miles south of Martinsburg, WV).  What a difference 20 miles makes. They run big time medicine there. The doctors actually care, listen to patients, run better and different tests to get at the root of the problem, and generally seem to care about the patient and seem to really want the patient to recover - difficult with congestive heart failure but at least they are trying.   All of the nurses & staff seem to be at a minimum fairly happy  and a lot very happy.

The wonderful thing about living in M'burg & where it is located is that there are hospitals 20 minutes north and south as well as another serious hospital in Frederick, MD  You are close to DC & Baltimore (90 miles) & 4 hours from NYC if that is your taste in entertainment.

"Hello, 25F college student here; I’ve lived in WV all my life, and bounced around the bigger towns. You could do Morgantown, if you like a party town. I absolutely hate the traffic there, and it’s definitely not for me. A good second option would be Fairmont, which is close to Morgantown (also a college town, but much smaller) and has a kind-of small town feel. 

Huntington is where I went to school. I had fun, but it has a serious drug problem, and the people aren’t that great in my opinion. 

Charleston is pretty cool, in my opinion. I like it there, and it doesn’t feel too congested. You can find some really cute houses to buy/rent there, and the amenities are endless. 

If you want small town, Lewisburg is pretty cool; I can’t deny that. However, I’m from Nicholas county, and I think Summersville is an awesome mix of city amenities with outdoor fun and small town vibes. The same goes for Fayetteville, and both are super close to Summersville Lake and New River Gorge National Park! 

There’s my two cents. Good luck with your move! :)

"Might have something to do with Morgantown becoming the largest city in WV 6 Saturdays a year, as well as the other things that go along with the college town. Its definitely one of the more fast-paced and few growing metro areas in the state. It definitely has the suburb of Pittsburgh-like culture, as well as Wheeling in that regard. Once you get to Weston the culture starts shifting towards the stereotypical Appalachian culture. Mason county and north along the Ohio River is kind of its own culture, Charleston to Huntington and south to the border is kind of its own. Greenbrier  county and north up the border to the panhandle is kind of its own culture as well.

"I’m not OP, but I have lived in and around Charleston most of my life.  

Restaurants - 
nicer/fine dining - Noah’s or 1010 Bridge.  

Pizza - eat in/artisan - Pies & Pints or Lola’s. 
Pizza - classic/delivery - Graziano’s.  

Burritos/tacos - Black Sheep (great brunch also)

Sushi - Ichiban. 

Classic Italian - Fazio’s. 

Filipino - Barkadas. 

Indian - Newab. 

Chinese takeout - China One. 

Breakfast - Tudor’s Biscuit World or Suzi’s for classic WV breakfast.  First Watch (chain) for healthier/more traditional option.  

Ice Cream - Ellen’s, Caffe Romeo.  

Bakery - Rock City, Sarah’s, Vandalia Donuts.  

Pepperoni Rolls are the unofficial state food.  Grab a good one at Pepperoni Grill in Kanawha City.

If you’re looking for a solid bourbon selection go to Hale House.  Good steak there, too.

Shopping - Kinship Goods, Base Camp Printing, Bear Wood, Taylor Books, JQ Dickinson has a nice gift shop outside of town - it’s out of the way and it’s small but it’s nice and they have unique local stuff.

There is a new skate park under the memorial bridge.  Walking the Sunrise Carriage Trail is a decent hike.  For parks try the Kanawha State Forest to the South or Coonskin a bit North of Charleston.

If you want to hit a few golf balls and grab a slice of pizza and a beer go to Southridge Golf Range.",t2_og9le,HoagiesNGrinders,0,1648672471.0,0,t1_i2rfdjo,i2rfdjo,False,burstintoflames,t3_ts9tgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/ts9tgs/what_cities_would_you_recommend_to_someone_moving/,What cities would you recommend to someone moving to West Virginia?,/r/WestVirginia/comments/ts9tgs/what_cities_would_you_recommend_to_someone_moving/i2rfdjo/,5,r/WestVirginia,0,5

"Eastern panhandle will be limited for internet unless you’re in Jefferson County. Berkeley & Morgan Counties *can* be a crapshoot, and it’s totally area-dependent.

Morgantown is a solid city option (that you can get decently away from for a more rural feel without being too far out) that has plenty of nearby outdoor activities and good internet. Lewisburg is a really cute little town if you’re looking for that kind of feel.

"Charleston is the largest, uh, I guess I'll call it metropolitan area in the state. It's barely a city. If you're from DC it's gonna feel pretty dinky.

"Pros
1 it’s where I grew up and made me who I am

2 mountains, lush and green in the summer and the calico colors of fall

3 some of the most kind hearted, will do anything to help, wonderful people I have ever met, not everyone, that’s next list

4 valley market in Logan. I was raised on their ham salad, cheese salad and antipasta, crave it to this day and get tubs of it when I go back

5 struggling to find a 5th. I’ll table this and maybe come back to it


Cons
1 how absolutely devastating it is when I go back and see the tops of mountains blown off and the shitty job of reclaiming the land

2 what am I going to do with 5 bags of trash and broken microwave? well throw it in the creek of course

3 Manchin. The man who has not one shit to give for the people in his state, relaxing in his yacht, counting the money he makes throwing WV under the bus. You reckon he ever gets on Reddit? Fuck you Manchin. Politics in WV has always been the worst. My dad was involved in the 80s and it was corrupt then and has gotten no better

4 while some people are the best, some are the worst. God forbid we open our mind, broaden our horizons and realize there are a variety of people in this world outside the holler, and that’s ok that they’re a little different than you. You miss out on wonderful people and learning about interesting things being like that. Plus it’s not nice. People can be stubborn and totally reject difference and change. 

5 what I hate the most is how so many have given up. There’s no jobs, education sucks, not a lot of opportunity for anything. Generational poverty has taken its toll and drugs are rampant and politicians don’t care. So they accept it and you can see it in faces everywhere, it’s taken it’s toll, they’ve hardened and accepted it. I wish they would vote in someone that cared and made a visible difference to make the quality of life better. It breaks my heart

Unfortunately I could go on with cons. That breaks my heart but despite that, I love WV and want so much better for it. The people and the mountains they live in deserve so much better


Just so I’m clear on this, once again, Fuck you Manchin.

"I apologize u/WVStarbuck if I wrote you a wall of text. I just had some free time this afternoon and I wanted to.

&#x200B;

I worked manual labor in a candy factory in NC for six months. I was getting ready to move here to West Virginia to help my parents whose mobility is failing. I worked two nights with an older lady who was a couple years off from retirement, or so she said: that old generation that probably should be retired already but doesn't know how to stop working. Anyway, just two nights beside her, and let's say she left an impression. Just chock-full of wisdom. All my adult life I've hated factories but she defended them in a way I hadn't considered before. She was fairly old so she'd seen my town grow up. She said that the factories didn't like and didn't want their employees to get an education, because they would leave. I said that was wrong. She didn't say it wasn't, but she said the towns depended on the mills to survive at the time. She left me with a lot to think about in such a short span of time. I got her information before I left and still write her letters to say hello and wish her well.

&#x200B;

She shut up a young boy who was blathering on about politics whose energy on the subject was probably better spent elsewhere. She shut him down with that very maternal heavy-handed sort of way, with a stern-pointed finger, and the unspoken but overhanging threat of a spanking if he didn't stop. And of course he did. He said he stopped because she was old and he was just being polite, but we all knew he was trying to save face because he had just got his ass kicked! I'll probably remember that for a long time.

&#x200B;

She talked about neighbors and how it used to be. That's the part of your post that reminded me of this woman. How they all knew each other and looked out for each other and their kids out the window, from the porch, etc. She mentioned the bible as well and that it had shaped/guided their duties to one another. She noticed that it's all so different now and not like how it was when she was growing up. I still don't know how we might get back to looking out for each other so devoutly. I think the answer is less in the bible and more in how antisocial we've become, but that's my opinion. But I don't think the problem is unique to WV, and I know you never claimed that it was, I'm just throwing in another data point.

&#x200B;

When I'm in control of all my faculties, I don't wish ill on anyone. Sometimes emotion gets the better of me though, and when I see that a stubborn person has inadvertently killed someone, half of, or his whole family because of either their beliefs or refusal to believe in what our doctors are saying--or they have chosen death over conceding their beliefs to qualify for an organ transplant--I can't stop myself from saying, ""Good."" 

Me in control of all my faculties would better say, ""It's unfortunate that had to happen to learn a rudimentary lesson."" There's always even the chance they still miss the lesson. But that really hit home what you said: grandchildren killing their grandparents through ignorance, selfishness, negligence. I've definitely seen my share of those people, but thankfully they're not the only ones out there.

&#x200B;

I think we're being emotional. We've seen so much bad, it's easy to forget or overlook the good, especially because it should be standard, right? No complaints sometimes equals good reviews, except you don't hear about them. You do hear about the bad. Always. So it can get and seem unbalanced. I agree with almost everything in this thread, your observations and everyone else's. The bigotry and hatred you've seen is real, and I put it on one end of the scale and on the other I would put the comment that one of the people's pros was that ""the people really are trying."" I think that's true. Maybe not the older/oldest generation as far as accepting change and new ideas, they're kind of set in their ways in that respect and nearly impossible to reprogram. But you may have noticed that their kids, and their children's children especially, are more and more doing a double-take, ""Huh? No, that doesn't seem right,"" the next time their fathers and mothers try to pass on their hate doctrines in the living room or the dining room. I know I rejected it when my own father tried to teach me to hate black people from an early age. My best friend in first grade's name was Jeremy, and he was black. My father was too slow I guess, and too few in number compared to those in the ranks of love and kindness equality that got to me first, and stronger, and overwhelmingly more often.

&#x200B;

There's a constant ebb and flow of hatred and acceptance shifting the status on racism and the LGBTQ community (and so many other races and communities) in the world, but I think, however small it may seem, hatred IS losing out. We know it will always exist, but I don't want you thinking the side of good is completely depleted.

"Lower part of the state here. We have onions, potatoes, and lettuce already in the ground. We have just started our 250 tomato plants. 35 pepper plants.

Outside seeds are  planted, squashes, melons, corn ( we space that out every two weeks so you don't have too much corn coming in at one time), cucumbers, beans (same as corn, plant seeds two weeks apart to keep too many from coming in at one time), peppers, beets, carrots and other seeds go straight into the ground. 

We can anything we can't eat right away. Our cellar will hold about 1000 jars. We have filled it many times. We dehydrate a lot of produce. We have very little waste. But what we do have, it goes into a composter. We process the tomatoes and gather the seeds and peels. Dehydrate the tomato waste, use a food processor to powder the peels, then use a sifter to remove any seeds. Once all of that is done, we put the powder in a coffee grinder and get dry tomato powder to add to food  or if you eat condiments on your sandwich, you can mix it with them.

"It isn't a one-or-the-other situation. Cost of living is being driven up by corporate buy-ups of residential properties more than any population boom. Even is happening in the few growth areas of this state.

Fact of the matter is this state puts a lot of the onus on the resident to earn money here and spend money here. So if there are less residents then there is less of a tax base to draw from. That's a big reason they keep trying to gut income tax in favor of a larger sales tax, not knowing all of their growth areas are so close to the border, everyone would gladly go to PA, VA, OH, MD, or KY to shop and therefore defeating the purpose. So in this instance, they need people to move here, not just visit.

1.The state parks are awesome, no shortage of places to visit. 

2.Lots of good people here

3.Plenty of outdoor activities

4.Cost of living isn’t going as crazy as it seems to be everywhere else

Cons:

1. Again, the people. I’ve met some of the best folks on earth here, and I’ve also met some of the worst. The mentality that you don’t count unless you’ve been here struggling your entire life has to stop.

2. The bigotry. Whether we want to admit it or not, it’s a big issue. 

3. Food. At least here in the panhandle, the pinnacle of cuisine is just bar food for the rest of the country. 

4. The government. From local municipalities to state level, we have some real winners here. 

5. Drugs. Access to treatment here is lacking, and the way we treat addicts is kind of appalling. Cracked out or not, that’s your neighbor, not your enemy.

"The pros:

1.  The mountains.  The beauty of this landscape satisfies my soul in a primal way.

2.  Having four distinct seasons, each of which is breathtaking at its acme.

3.  Water.  We haven't had the extreme droughts that other parts of the nation have experienced.  I love the rain, the creeks and streams and rivers and lakes.

4.  The variety of nature and the frequency with which I can observe it.

5.  I can still easily find dark skies for stargazing.

The cons:

1.  Littering.  I see so much litter on roadsides and it's mindboggling that people are so fucking lazy and short sighted.

2.  Corruption in politics.

3.  Conservatism.

4.  The lack of oversight and rule enforcement against law breaking corporations, specifically mine operators, who have treated this state like a thing to be raped and left battered and broken.

"Likes:
1. Natural beauty (of areas not completely destroyed by mining/timber industries)
2. Historic significance (mine wars, statehood, and beginnings of War on Poverty)
3. Not crowded in population
4. It's ""home"" to me
5. There exists potential for industries to boom here, especially in remote work settings.

Dislikes:
1. People were mostly fine with this state being destroyed and polluted to oblivion for the sake of a meager paycheck (thankfully that seems to be turning the corner ever so slightly).
2. The voting populace is easily distracted and swayed into authoritarian/fascist tendencies simply by playing into ""coal, guns, and god"" emotional responses. 
3. Hatred and bigotry continues to seep out of many people because of the rural disconnect with the rest of the country, along with the state not having any major urban areas to counter it in elections.
4. Federal spending seems to always be thrown into a black hole here. We as a state absorb plenty of money from blue states while simultaneously hating them, but that money is either pocketed or never spent efficiently on what it was intended to cover.
5. Infrastructure here is so far behind other states that the aforementioned ""black hole"" is currently swallowing any and all allocated funding for ""broadband"" only for Frontier to stow away and never provide improved services.

"1. It's beautiful.
2. It's so easy to drive here. No traffic :) 
3. There are some unique places.
4. Most people really try their best. 
5. Arts and music scene is small but great. Mountain Stage.

Dislikes: 

1. The food. There are not a lot of great restaurants in the state. I can think of less than 10. There's a lot of country cooking and chains. 
2. Politics. Self-serving and embezzling politicians. 
3. There's not a ton to do / it can be hard to find something to do. I've lived in several parts of the state and people are left to their own devices a lot. Not a ton of events going on or diverse events. 
4. Roads are not great, but that can be said for a lot of states. 
5.

"As an ex-smoker, I'm probably *way* more sensitive to smelling it than you are.  Once you're a smoker and then quit, the smell just becomes disgusting (more so than before you start smoking).  A lot of ex-smokers I know claim the same thing.

That said, it doesn't bother me unless it's in an enclosed space (e.g. riding in a car and the smoke blows back in).  Otherwise, they're adults and can do what they want: their bodies, their choices.

Yeah, people take smoke breaks at work.  But in all the jobs I've had, most people (myself included when I smoked) take their one 15 minute break and cut into three, 5 minute breaks.  If they're taking more than that, then they're probably not going to be that productive even if they were non-smokers sitting at their desk the whole time.",t2_gx8gn8s,asimons04,0,1648487548.0,0,t1_i2gk8ft,i2gk8ft,False,Lopsided-Nail-8384,t3_tq6xg7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WestVirginia/comments/tq6xg7/likes_and_dislikes/,Likes and Dislikes,/r/WestVirginia/comments/tq6xg7/likes_and_dislikes/i2gk8ft/,3,r/WestVirginia,0,3
