"depends on what you like to do? there are lots of parks not far from you.

His name should be on the paperwork. If it's not, file a complaint, and records request his name/salary/rank, etc, etc.  
NEVER give permission to search. If they have PC they'll search regardless of what you say.   
Lot's of reports of cops planting drugs to get promoted.   
Never answer any questions. Don't offer any information. ALL you're required to give at a traffic stop is your license, insurance, & registration, if you don't have your license, you're required to give first/last name, address, birthday..period. Where you're going/coming from is none of their business. The reason they ask stupid questions is to get you talking so they can judge if you're drunk/high.

&#x200B;

  
A Florida elementary school teaching assistant has been busted on heroin charges after she was accused of selling drugs to a teenager who later overdosed and died, according to police.  


  
Marina Deetz, a 20-year-old staffer at Moon Lake Elementary in New Port Richey, was accused by a 17-year-old boy of selling fentanyl to him and his 18-year-old friend, who later died, an arrest affidavit shows.  


  
The teaching assistant was accused of selling the drugs to the teens for $50 — then snorting some with them while also doing cocaine, the Pasco County sheriff’s report says.  


  
Officers later searched her home and car and found heroin, along with fentanyl residue on a straw like the one the teen said they had used, the documents say. A torn $20 bill like one the teen said they used to buy the drugs was also found in her purse, according to the affidavit.  


  
In interviews, Deetz admitted taking drugs with the teens — but denied providing the fentanyl used by the boy who died, the documents state.  


  
Deetz was arrested and charged with possession of both heroin and fentanyl as well as drug paraphernalia.  


  
Officers did not give details on the boy’s death, nor his identity, citing an active investigation.",t2_ag2bf3jz,HipHop_Local_Legends,0,1644426558.0,0,t1_hw8wh08,hw8wh08,True,HipHop_Local_Legends,t3_soiivo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pasco/comments/soiivo/20_year_old_teaching_assistant_marina_deetz_was/,20 year old Teaching Assistant Marina Deetz was arrested on drug charges after she sold fentanyl to 2 teenagers causing one of them to overdose and die.,/r/Pasco/comments/soiivo/20_year_old_teaching_assistant_marina_deetz_was/hw8wh08/,1,r/Pasco,0,1

"Yes, there are exemptions for everything. When you're in hot pursuit of a subject, and about to bail out of the car, it's common practice to take the seat belt off so you don't get hung up when exiting the car. Why would he NOT want to wear a seat belt during a high speed pursuit? We see the last moments of a chase. Who is to say he didnt take it off seconds before the footage started when the suspect bailed out of a vehicle and went on foot? He would know the vehicle state of the pursuit is over and he will be exiting.   


The problem with you and people like you is that if you got a seatbelt ticket written to you, you would be on here arguing the opposite, that seatbelt laws don't affect anyone else except the person choosing not to wear it and that it wasn't any of the officer's business. All of you people nitpick such stupid points where its obvious to anyone that you don't care about the actual merits of your argument, you just want to hate on the police.  


There are plenty of people who hold the police accountable that do a great job and are fair and unbiased. Look at a Youtube channel called ""Audit the Audit"". More often then not he absolutely scathes police for minor things, but he is fair and reasonable. You are not. You are just here to hate on the police. I'm not in love with the police either, you won't ever hear me yelling ""back the blue"" but c'mon dude.

"Fair assessment. The 3 pre-filed candidates are all Republican, as am I. My 'plan' is that while the other candidates all push their status-quo, cookie-cutter agendas and fight over the same voters, I can excite everyone else, the people who want to shake things up, to give me a shot.

It will be tough. Like you said, I'd have to beat an incumbent whose basically kept her nose down and didn't make enemies the last year, and it's a non-Presidential election, so getting people to the polls will certainly pose a challenge.

"I will not pretend to know much about the inner workings of Pasco county government but as a previous commenter said people are mainly voting based on either republican or Democrat. I’m in district 5 and was disappointed to see Jack get elected again. This county needs to start being on the people’s side and not shady business deals or re-zoning protected lands to put in gas stations.

"Since no one else has commented yet, I'll give you an honest answer. More than 95% of voters don't give a fuck about anything except whether the party next to the name they're voting for says Democrat or Republican, and most voters in Pasco are gonna vote Republican on everything. I'm not gonna pretend I know how the elections work past that, but my assumption is that it'd be pretty damn difficult to win the Republican primary against a Republican who already holds the office, and it would be pretty damn difficult to win an election as a member of another party against a Republican in Pasco.",t2_gdmvp,FrozenEagles,0,1640673374.0,0,t1_hq8zhan,hq8zhan,True,DiscoingGD,t3_rq1h0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pasco/comments/rq1h0x/thinking_of_running_for_county_commissioner/,"Thinking of running for County Commissioner, District 4.

"Will try to summarize some examples of my critiques:

* Lack of Transparency/Accountability: Had an issue that the cops told me was Code Enforcement's jurisdiction, yet Code Enforcement said it was the cop's and they were just being lazy. Put them both on the same email chain and asked whose responsibility it was and who was wrong, but neither would engage in written answers. Some time later, a Lt. told me in person that they had the necessary tools to resolve the issue and should have. It was a mess and no one should have to pull teeth like that to resolve an issue. Responsibilities and procedures should be spelled out and clearly defined and it's the Commissioner's job to guide that.
* Unwilling to Engage in Open Communication: On several issues where there has been contention, the county (i.e. the Commissioners) are very dismissive and often indifferent to the pleas of the community. They may let people speak at the meetings (because they have to), but the arguments and concerns are not addressed, merely ignored as they shoe the people away and hurry to the next person. At the local level, direct communication and debate with the 'leadership' should be paramount. Instead, they do whatever is in their interests and dictate to the people what is going to be done. On a similar note, the county's social media only gets a couple comments a post, and anyone with questions/critiques/concerns is never responded to.
* Crowding the County/Ignoring the People: Anyone that's lived here for more than 5 years can see how much new development has been approved, much of it tiny properties they've jammed into our wetlands to get as many homes/sqft as they can. Housing developers seem to monetarily support the existing commissioners who approve this, and Starkey, who is in the family that owns much of this land, is involved in these decisions, clearly a conflict of interest. The point is though, no one I know wants to be as population dense as Pinellas or Hillsborough. Also, the county goes out of their way to dress up the new areas and big roads, like all the freshly paved main roads and palm trees on US 19, yet I walk my neighborhood and surrounding areas and what do I see? Ragged streets/sidewalks filled with cracks, potholes, and even sinkholes that have been there for months/years, dead and flickering street lights, the list goes on. On the surface level, the main streets are being gentrified, but our neighborhoods, the neighborhoods of the people who have lived in and built this community, are being left to rot so that the commissioners can market the new areas and make money on real estate development, or the best case that they're not openly corrupt, think their salary will go up with more people and more taxes.",t2_1kxk1qjq,DiscoingGD,0,1640650724.0,0,t1_hq7pgs1,hq7pgs1,True,DiscoingGD,t3_rq1h0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pasco/comments/rq1h0x/thinking_of_running_for_county_commissioner/,"Thinking of running for County Commissioner, District 4.

"Pardon my 1am poor grammar, rambling thoughts and run on sentences.

Hadn’t thought of game sets, that’s a great suggestion!

Definitely a jazz/blues/ some acoustic type music. Even thought of getting a collection of vinyls for less busy nights when there might be enough time to handle a record player
Either way, volume just loud enough to dull the sound of the air purifiers humming

And probably not within the first month, but would also want to put in a library (space permitting) and encourage regulars to “take a book leave a book”, or treat it as an extension of their own personal library (in case someone gets too into a book and wishes to take it home to finish)

Not sure about a charcuterie board, love the idea, I just know most counties won’t let smoke and food mix. However I don’t think anyone county-wise would mind the many different food trucks that are typically parked out front of the nearby Zephyrhills Brewing Co being purchased there and then brought in. I’m not even sure I could justify a fee for doing so, it’s helping the community/local economy, which is one of my main focuses.

As far as Non smokers and ladies, I’ve been in and around ybor enough to see plenty at most locations as long as the air is mostly clean and the room is welcoming. Either way I’m planning on local craft beers and some wine options (in addition to bourbon, scotch, brandy, and a rotation of whiskeys)

I do appreciate the spit-balling, thank you

Too bad there isn’t already a decent lounge nearby to properly have this conversation. Then again, if there was I probably wouldn’t be so motivated to open one up myself.

I’m still working on finding the correct location, visited one today and two more next week.

Thank you again for commenting, hearing that there are like-minded individuals let’s me know that all the work I’ve done so far, and the many many hours and long nights ahead will be worth it (and hopefully not end up being a statistic of the typical start up: 90% go under within the first 3 years… although I genuinely think this is due to poor management/leadership with employees leading to poor customer service and not typically a lack of customers)

If you want to attract more women and people who might not smoke, you could throw in some wine offerings and a charcuterie board (which you could probably contract out to a local deli to package so you don't need a kitchen). You could also let people bring their own food/drinks for a fee so you don't have to bother with any of it.

"1. Inside info is speaking directly to pasco officers and how they utilize this system.

2. Thanks for helping me define what I was trying to explain. 

3.i can understand the outcry. Can you explain to me why this is so bad? What information is shared? 

4. You aren’t proving me wrong. Yes. There are those flagged and harassed falsely. There are absolutely offenders utilizing the media attention to get cops off their backs and have the media shield them while being criminal citizens. There are both. 

5. It’s not a straw man in this scenario. I know pasco cops. I’ve heard their side of the story. Those that actually utilize this system. It’s first hand knowledge. 

There’s no reason to think I’m attacking you. I’m simply sharing a opposing point of view to this. As with most things, the truth typically falls in the middle.

"Let’s deconstruct this:
1. That’s not inside info
2. The purpose of the monitoring is based on “predictive behavior models” to predict if people will commit crime.
3. The PCSO worked with Pasco County Schools to provide information to PCSO about FERPA protected information. TBT, or as you put it “the media” blew the cover off that and after public outcry, PCS ceased and desisted. 
4. If you don’t just rely on media videos and read the articles, it wasn’t just the offenders who are bringing attention to this, or as you put it, “playing victim”.
5. Having law enforcement friends is a straw man argument that assumes people cannot support law enforcement without disagreement of police tactics. I also have friends in law enforcement. Congrats to both of us.

"Im against police harassment but as someone with law enforcement friends the media is blowing this up. Here’s the inside info.
Pasco uses a database to note repeat offenders. Whether that’s a pattern of domestic violence calls, juvenile crimes etc. They then will monitor these repeat offenders because they have a high probability to commit crimes or cause issues. After awhile, you fall off the database. 

Here’s the thing. The people crying to the media ARE the repeat OFFENDERS. So of course they want to play victim as much as possible. The sheriff office doesn’t get the same limelight of media defense. It’s a one sided argument.

">The problem is most traffic infractions must be witnessed by the officer.

Not in the case of an accident with physical indications and evidence. FHP writes tickets for accidents they were not present for routinely.

The issue becomes if the ticket is challenged the officer's testimony cannot be used as evidence and neither can the ticket (beyond its existence and notation of the visible facts).

Instead witnesses will be called who tend not to show up.

So, yes, this person could get away with it if the victim doesn't follow through.

But we can all be smarter than the victim and avoid risk to ourselves both physically and financially by waiting for FHP.

Further, PCSO loves to hide behind all sorts of reasons for why they don't do a whole lot. Very little to no patrol routes, very little to no DUI enforcement. Let's add refusal to conduct traffic operations or accident investigations.

The list goes on.

Lastly, PCSO, FHP and the State's Attorney office have an obligation to the community to prosecute when a pedestrian is struck especially in an egregious manner like this. Whether the victim wants to press charges or not the authorities can do so.

"Dade city is cleaning up too - lots of rich moving in buying large swathes of land. Hudson’s reputation is unwarranted - I’ve never seen these crackheads everyone keeps talking about and none of the locals, many who have lived here over 20 years, know what they’re talking about either. There’s some bad crime in Bayonet Point / northern Port Richey, and a small patch that some consider Hudson that’s on the bay, but they don’t compare to the west part of Tampa or Suitcase City by a long shot. It’s gotten so great in Hudson that housing prices are skyrocketing and insurance rates are plummeting due to a steep decline in crime.",t2_cciqi,ThymeCypher,0,1625456746.0,0,t1_h43drvp,h43drvp,False,[deleted],t3_odbxqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pasco/comments/odbxqf/i_went_to_pasco_county_and_found_out_they_have/,i went to pasco county and found out they have drive thrus for panera bread and liquor stores in gas stations,/r/Pasco/comments/odbxqf/i_went_to_pasco_county_and_found_out_they_have/h43drvp/,1,r/Pasco,0,1

"Yeah I'm inclined to believe it's possible some of the issues here are secretarial problems, like maybe the owner should have actually got a quote for the full repair price so the court could have assessed that as the price instead of the $200 repair that wasn't sufficient. And maybe it's the court's fault that the payment wasn't delivered from them to the victim on time. Those seem reasonable enough to believe although they aren't ideal.

OP says the criminal charge was dropped though, even though it's a misdemeanor. Why not just charge him, let him plead guilty, and give a small fine if it's the first offense? Or give one day in jail, just to indicate that yes this was a crime and we accept that you're willing to pay the consequence which is now *more* (even marginally so) because we had to track you down.

Really I don't care specifically what the outcome of a minor property damage case is, but I do care that the law is applied evenly to everyone. If that's how the courts handle every single property damage case then okay, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to me since there's now no incentive to proactively offer to repair the damage until the court gets involved. Hence why I suspect this isn't how most cases are handled and am inclined to question whether the fact that this was a police officer is providing any favors. I don't think the punishment should be significant (60 days in jail sounds ridiculous to me even though the law allows it), but zero seems too low to me.",t2_fybcn,halberdierbowman,0,1623357749.0,0,t1_h1bpp9i,h1bpp9i,False,TampaCopWatch,t3_nwa9ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pasco/comments/nwa9ku/surveillance_video_captures_pasco_county_deputy/,Surveillance video captures Pasco County deputy damaging a business security gate,/r/Pasco/comments/nwa9ku/surveillance_video_captures_pasco_county_deputy/h1bpp9i/,1,r/Pasco,0,1

"Florida Highway Patrol usually handles accidents in Pasco County on certain roads as far as I know. Were you on State Road 52/54/56? US Highway 19? I-75 or the Suncoast? You don't have to answer specifically which one. There's a chance they handle others as well but I've only seen them on those roads when I lived there.

As for the hit and run. The first thing you'd want to do is write down everything you remember about the other car/person's description. After that, take a photo with your phone of all the damage, where the vehicle was when it was hit, etc. After that; if you can still drive it, move it off of the road into the closest parking spot. Never leave it in the road to impede traffic unless it's not moveable/injured person can't/shouldn't get out of the vehicle because they need emergency assistance.

A hit and run with no injures is probably a low priority call but I don't work for FHP/Pasco Sheriff but that's probably what happened and why you waited so long. Like someone else said; they probably aren't staffed very well and had other high priority calls going on.

"I think it is supposed to be 45,700 which was what the governor raised the minimum starting salary to, but I don't know if Pasco was able to meet that.

But our schools are neighborhood schools so there is more parent involvement and most kids are really nice and sweet - In my experience.

"Pasco, for reasons I've yet to understand, does not have their deputies work crashes/traffic incidents. They leave it to FHP, which there are probably only 4-5 working at any one time, handling every traffic incident in the county (which is why you're almost guaranteed to wait hours in Pasco).

They're the only county around here that I know of that leaves it entirely to FHP; The H stands for Highway btw, which means they're supposed to be on the highways and interstates while the locals work the little roads, parking lots, etc.

I'm not blaming the County Deputies, as I'm pretty sure they've never been properly trained on working the crash or the paperwork, but it's disgraceful from the outside looking in, especially hearing stories like yours.

Hopefully the media can blow this up and help initiate some change, because without major public outcry, I've found the administration in our county to be totally useless. Also, in this political climate, I guess it's good you clarified yourself, but it seemed obvious to me that you are not hating on officers, but merely criticizing the procedures which have proved inefficient and ineffective for we the taxpayers.

I'm with you for demanding change or a reasonable explanation as to why our county is so dependent on the state police.

">The decision comes two days before Gov. Ron DeSantis’ March 2020 executive order proclaiming a state health emergency is set to expire after its sixth extension.

Does anyone have info as to DeSantis' decision? The article states that the above memo went out before any government comment.

"While the restrictions are unnecessary to some extent, it’s in response to a steep rise in medical marijuana being sold privately. The limits imposed will have no effect on anyone who is prescribed medical marijuana for medicinal use and offers the ability to get approval from the board should the limits somehow impact your medical needs.

Edit: it’s also to combat the pay for a license market that came from medical legalization that is starting to have a very negative impact in many industries. The US government is one of if not the largest employer in the nation, and holding a medical marijuana card makes you ineligible for employment with the government as well as many top companies. The predatory practice of advertising to young adults who have not established a career only to completely lose the ability to work in almost every industry should be ended, and the fight for legalization needs to be focused on a federal level - especially since Biden has been vocal that he is not in support of legalization only decriminalization which doesn’t solve the problem at all, only fixes the racial discrepancies (and it may not even do that)

"Yes it's all going up. Older stock is going up slower than newer stock. Land value is also substantially increasing.

For flood zones they're a good guide but don't expect if you're in a no flood zone that you don't need flood insurance.

However even out of a flood zone it's quite expensive. Do your homework using elevation.

For example our house was new construction so I know the elevation of the foundation. It's four feet above the elevation of the nearest wetland which is also the highest elevation of wetlands in the area. Literally everywhere else would have to flood before I flood, so it's not needed.

For security at minimum get a keyless lock combo keyless is incredibly cheap. This makes them immune to bump attacks. From there a home security system... Install yourself and get monitored or just pay the money for one. It's usually a very small discount on insurance.

Other than that make sure you're aware of the wind rating of the house you're buying and plan to harden it for hurricanes.",t2_32u4o,MeisterX,0,1613937955.0,0,t1_go9ez6d,go9ez6d,True,[deleted],t3_lp3lga,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pasco/comments/lp3lga/deleted_by_user/,[deleted by user],/r/Pasco/comments/lp3lga/deleted_by_user/go9ez6d/,3,r/Pasco,0,3

"There's a cute nature preserve right in NPR with a boardwalk and canoe/kayak launch on the Cotee. James E Grey preserve. No parking fee!

There's a great canoe/kayak rental place on the Hillsborough River about an hour from NPR in Thonotosassa called Canoe Escape. The park they rent out of is a public park so just a $2 fee and if you get your own vessel that you can hand-carry you don't have to pay the extra $5 boat dock fee. (Rental fees are extra and are from the private company).

Starkey park has a great biking trail that goes all the way to the Suncoast Parkway if you're looking for distance riding but not on roadways. There are offshoots for off-road biking along that trail and some good hiking/horse back riding in the park as well.

If you go a few hours north you can go up to the Blue or Ginnie springs in High Springs. Swim in the cold ass spring water and marvel at its clarity and then tube down the Sante Fe river. Camping available all over that area as well if you want to make a weekend out of it (don't go on a holiday/school holiday weekend unless you want to hangout with all the kids from UF).

You'd have to go pretty far to find a waterfall of any substance. The north Georgia mountains around Helen are gorgeous and Helen itself is a pretty neat little German tourist trap. About 8-10hrs drive.

There are oodles of public greenspaces around here, though. Green Key Beach (Robert K Rees Memorial Park) is a pretty nice spot for watching sunsets right from the water/beach.

"video description - Drug overdoses, primarily from opioids such as oxycontin and fentanyl, have doubled in Pasco County, Florida, this year. It’s one of the hidden side effects of the COVID pandemic and subsequent lockdown that has left many without the support they need during their most vulnerable moments. “They're not just dying of a COVID virus, they're dying of overdoses and they're dying of suicide ... There's a hopelessness that comes along in that moment.” Kevin lost the mother of his son to a drug overdose during the pandemic. He was also forced to close the 12-step program at his church, he says, and he feels powerless as COVID's impact tears through his community.

"Looks like it is legal to park in the roadway so as not to block the sidewalk.

They amended the ordinance in 2009. It does also explicitly prohibit parking in a driveway in ""such a manner as to block a sidewalk"" as well.

So park in the roadway in the direction of traffic if that's what you need to do.

"Wow, that’s insane. Yeah in my situation there is several feet of driveway behind the cars to walk around.

I believe there’s a county law prohibiting street parking. Probably not enforced though unless you’re on Big Brother Pasco Sheriff’s target list,t2_4fowc6i1,LolKnights87,0,1599301599.0,0,t1_g43um53,g43um53,False,[deleted],t3_imsqd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pasco/comments/imsqd1/blocking_the_sidewalk_law_in_pasco/,Blocking the sidewalk law in pasco?,/r/Pasco/comments/imsqd1/blocking_the_sidewalk_law_in_pasco/g43um53/,4,r/Pasco,0,4
"My neighbors were a little more ""aggressive"" when my daughter's car was partially blocking the sidewalk (not completely forcing people to walk on the street), they slashed 4 tires on 2 separate cars. Interestingly though they stopped when a sheriff's deputy moved in 2 houses down, she still parks in the same spot.

"This is your answer here. We walk every night and have been almost hit several times because we have had to go into the street just to go around the cars. It’s definitely illegal and they are there to stop people from getting hit by those in the road.
