* Gardens on Spring Creek spring plant sale- also an awesome place to walk around in and get ideas: https://www.fcgov.com/gardens/spring-plant-sale

"Gulleys: great selection of house plants, outdoor plants  staff is very knowledgeable. Have a lot of sales to keep an eye out for.

Bath: has a nice vibe, lots of varieties, more fun household items/boutique things. Staff is sometimes hit or miss but usually helpful.

Palmers flowers: florist shop with some fun house plants both Loveland and fort Collins ones are great.


If you don't mind a bit of a drive

Windsor Gardener: a bit pricey compared to the others, but attached to a brewery and distillery.

The Loveland garden center: very reasonable prices, staff is great and owners are very friendly.

"As I've read this thread I thought FOR SURE there was no expectation of privacy in one's backyard.  But after some searching it seems there is precedent that that expectation is reasonable.  (Example I read was a hypothetical nude sunbathing scenario.  I'd always thought if you left the confines of your house you were giving up an expectation of privacy.)

My understanding is pointing a ""normal"" camera at a window is perfectly fine.  What can't be done is using a not-normal camera (such as a telephoto lens) to look inside beyond the capability of what the unaided human eye can see.  If someone is that concerned about someone looking in a window there is some responsibility of the homeowner to block the view (i.e. window coverings).  It all comes down to ""what is in plain sight"".

The way you MIGHT turn this into a game on your side is to do things in the backyard and act TOTALLY as if there is no camera there and you couldn't care less about your neighbor's nosiness.  Go back there and do whatever (garden, read a book, just hang out) and don't even look at the camera.  Don't even look at the person's house.  If you don't give her what she wants (a reaction from you.....you getting mad.....you getting incredulous) then watching you becomes the most boring thing in the world.  And usually people like that are looking for something interesting.  Be totally uninteresting to her.

I'M NOT A LAWYER!

If you get one and you think it's overreach - don't pay it.  It's an ACCUSATION.  It's not a TICKET.  I view the decision to pay it or not as similar to someone deciding to take a plea deal.  Some folks admit guilt for guarantee of a lesser charge.  This seems the same:  You can pay based on the accusation and be guaranteed a total $ outlay that will be less than if it turns into a real ticket.  Or you cannot pay it and........

....take the chance you'll be sent a summons to appear in court...which if that happens....I believe will end up in you paying much more $ than if the accusation had been paid.

"It kind of falls into categories, it's very much like an economy. If you spike oil prices, the cost of everything that uses oil is going up also. Those are the things we know are tied to oil, but then there are knock-on effects, things that are effected that you never would have guessed, until it happens. Australia is a really great example of this. 

They had these beetles in Australia that were eating their sugar cane. They thought ""we need to get rid of these beetles"", and so they tried spraying etc., finally they introduced the Cane Toad. The Cane Toad is now the most destructive invasive species on the continent. Predators cannot eat them, because they're poisonous, they kill thousands of native animals every year from exposure or from trying to eat them. Even children try to play with them and get toxic rashes. They'll get run over on the road and birds will die from eating them. It's not exactly a 1:1 comparison, but it shows how vital/devastating animals we consider ""pests"" can be in an ecosystem. 

Australia is probably the best example. They've made minor changes that completely messed things up for generations. They built a ""dingo fence"" in 1859 to keep the dingos from eating their livestock, which kept animals from being able to migrate, and then you had emu's building up on one side of the fence and destroying crops again. Then we're going to start what we call an actual ""war"" against these emus, killing them indiscriminately, on sight. Most recently, in the past 20 years, they've been culling kangaroos, because their population size exploded, and there's a lack of predators (aka dingos) that will take them. You can see how it just keeps going, all stemming from a fence that they put up in the 1800's.",t2_17g4vr,FoThizzleMaChizzle,0,1648910901.0,0,t1_i34343u,i34343u,False,awakefc,t3_tt1tjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tt1tjj/for_real_and_to_think_this_is_all_a_csu/,For real.

"I'm not from Fort Collins. Travel to Japan frequently, lots of time in LA. I book sushi dinners 3 months in advance when I travel.

Nimos is the worst sushi in town. I don't understand why it's held in such high esteem here. Sushi is actually the rice, and Nimos rice is ass.

I promise you everyone in Fort Collins is buying from the same vendor when it comes to fish, and the freshness of fish isn't what makes it good. Uni is a different story, but you don't order uni in NoCo. 

I eat at Nori. No sushi in NoCo is going to be great, but the service, drink, and overall experience at Nori is the best in town, imo.

Sometimes cities will work through a private company to do the enforcement, and if they do this, then you should never comply, because private companies don't actually have the power to be state enforcers and we shouldn't acquiesce to giving them that power unless you're keen on living under corporate feudalism.

"From the AP, 12/23/1987  
""FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) - Officially it‚Äôs known as the Fort Collins Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs advocacy committee, but to insiders it‚Äôs the Big Dot Committee, whose prowess is getting Fort Collins a bigger dot on the map.  
Rand McNally and Co., one of the nation‚Äôs largest map publishers, has decided to give the city a bigger dot largely because of the committee‚Äôs efforts.  
'When we looked at an atlas we were the same size as Greeley, Fort Morgan and Sterling, and that just didn‚Äôt seem fair,' said Doug Markley, committee chairman.  
According to the latest Rand McNally map of Colorado and Wyoming, which uses 1980 census figures, Fort Collins has a population of 65,092. Fort Morgan has a population of 8,768, Greeley 53,006 and Sterling 11,385.  
Markley said getting a bigger notation in maps and atlases should help the city increase its tourism and entice companies to move to Fort Collins.  
'When you open up an atlas and see a little bitty dot, you think it‚Äôs a burg,' he said. 'We want people to know we‚Äôre more substantial than that.'‚Ä≥

"I wonder what it would cost.   I can't really find a recent, non-biased source.

If you assume we keep the same amount of car lanes, you'd need to acquire some land in areas, probably move the sidewalks back, and add the infrastructure.  I assume you'd need to then purchase some type of plowing equipment?  And hire folks to drive the plowing equipment.

"Careful with unsubstantiated claims of ""ethical problems"".  You may not agree with folks, but that shouldn't be grounds for questioning their integrity.  Yes, several department heads and staff cleared out over the past couple years. Some were ready for a change of scenery, some needed to go, while others were simply burned out. How many of us are/have been there?

A few left because they saw no way forward with a Council that constantly trips over itself trying to pursue an agenda fraught with contradictions.  Housing affordability is issue numero uno, yet doesn't appear on their list of 37 priorities. (37 priorities!!)  Recovery of the song bird population is fabulous, but what of humans that can't find affordable childcare?

So the inside scoop is garbage in, garbage out.  The Council provided confusing and opaque guidance to the recruiters, failed to coalesce around critical skillsets, and engaged in awkward interactions with the candidate and the entire process.  Ultimately the majority of Council desparately hoped Ms. DeMartino would not only shine like the North Star amidst the fog of chaos, but agree to stay on at a discount.

"This is an issue being caused by reddit coding and how people are viewing/posting things. I'm not sure how /u/nonamecomputers posted this, but reddit got ahold of it and stuck the link into some weird class object/url screener thing. I'm not a web guy so I can't describe it correctly. But I can tell you that when viewed using old.reddit.com the link appears like it sounds like you see it, with a backslash (not foreslash) between for example 'Fort' and '_Collins'. Hover the link and you see all those backslashes show up as '%5C', which doesn't resolve right. However, if you view it using normal reddit the link looks and works just fine because of whatever it's doing under the hood. No idea what it would be doing on Mobile or a third-party viewer.

I've been running into this increasingly frequently. Most of the time so far the link will go to the proper page (usually it's other reddit posts) and load it just fine for a split second then display a 'not found' page error. Da fuq?

"There isn't really such a thing as ""pests"" in ecology. That's a manmade cultural construct that's basically used to say we think something is gross, ugly, or makes it harder for us to make money. As long as something is in its native or established habitat it probably has an important role to play in that ecosystem. Geese will keep plant and algae populations in check, especially in aquatic environments, and goose poop is probably an important fertilizer or microbial food source in those same environments. I'd wager that in a body of water like Sheldon Lake in City Park that without geese and ducks it would probably grow so much aquatic grass and algae that it would choke out the fish and turtle populations and require much more artificial maintenance. Goose eggs are food sources for foxes, raccoons, coyotes, etc. and geese themselves can be predated by wolves and coyotes, though I would think as a food source they are more important to scavengers than hunters when they die from other non-predation causes.",t2_60ydc,codyish,0,1648755664.0,0,t1_i2w0df9,i2w0df9,False,awakefc,t3_tt1tjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/tt1tjj/for_real_and_to_think_this_is_all_a_csu/,For real.

One thing I don't like is the new ""game day experience"".  It is so much more about beer and the stadium than football.

"So I've been doing chasing the northern lights in Colorado for about two decades, and what I've discovered is that under an absolutely perfect setting what you can see when you can see it is pretty underwhelming.

First, you need to go on a night when NASA says that the aurora will be visible - and it's usually just that one night and you usually don't find out about it until after it's over.   

Second, you need to go to a crazy dark spot.   You can't see anything from anywhere near Fort Collins.   You can drive east of Ault, I've found that a few miles east of Carr works as well... barely.

Third, even when you achieve both of these, what you see is nothing amazing.   What it looks like is a faint green haze on the northern horizon almost like there's a city there.  It's super faint, it's easier to see with a long exposure camera, and it is very low to the horizon.

"low income housing distorts the market and isn't fair to everyone else, particularly folks that are lower middle class.  Think about it why should someone making 35k be able to take advantage of distorted market pricing and someone at 40k being told tough luck.  It disincentivize folks from making more income because they lose benefits.

What should be happening is a combination of wages increasing higher density/upzoning and potentially more housing being built to meet demand.  The government shouldn't be subsidizing companies paying wages that are too low to support the workforce.  The housing issue is complicated because of all the additional regulation going in.  Density should be a slamdunk but there are too many NIBMYs in this town which is short for f u I have mine now go pound sand.    

Another complicating factor is all the folks working remotely which is distorting the home price and income.

Try zilker park in austin there are 100+ unleashed dogs at any given nice day and everyone gets along fine, train your dog and let them roam free if they are good. No need for this stupid post or all these idiotic responses. Colorado was once a free state but has turned into a bunch of idiots circle jerking over who can follow the law better. If a dog is smart acting and not aggressive it should be allowed to roam free in open areas (not by roads), think of it this way you are allowed to leave a bar and drive but you can be stopped for a dui, no one forces you to take an uber, however if you get too drunk to drive thats on you to make the decision to get a ride home.

"My service dog has been attacked by bigger off leash dogs as well as small children who should be on a leash.

Not everyone's dog can be approached.  Some are trying to pay attention to their owners and being attacked or jumped at, screamed at, or literally face grabbed, makes any dog - even well trained very good boys - reactive.

I've been accused of faking my service dog because every time he gets attacked, we have to re-do a lot of training.. but he still has to assist me while he's also retraining that reactive behavior away.. which means if we are in public and a dog lunges toward him, he's going to react even while he's on duty which is stressful, embarrassing, and downright dangerous to me.

It actually just happened again last week and the guy was calling the dog by name, while I'm here struggling, holding my dog up, trying to kick this one away while he's jumping on me trying to get to my dog, I'm literally screaming 'help me I'm holding a service dog' and at least 10- 15 minutes goes by and the guy finally comes over and says ""sorry it's not my dog, I'm just dog sitting""

If you have a dog you have spent lots of time and energy on training, that comes when you call *every* time, then I would agree: off leash no harm no foul.

"According to the [Census](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/fortcollinscitycolorado/POP060210), the 2016-2020 owner-occupied housing rate for Fort Collins was 55.3%. So overall, a little less than half the city is rentals.

As for your idea of requiring owner-occupancy... Well, it can be done with development covenants and deed restrictions, and those can be incentivized by municipalities (easing of development restrictions/requirements/fees/etc. in exchange for). This already happens in some cases with deeded income restrictions, and it's considerably easier to find info on that and why it does/doesn't work.

But as for a law requiring owner-occupancy, it's surprisingly hard to find any info about that or the legality. A brief attempt at searching comes back with a lot of 'tenant rights' related results, and if you get past that then laws requiring owner-occupancy *specific to ADUs* (accessory dwelling units) and how those are sometimes successfully challenged start showing up.

"You really need to learn how zoning actually works and what it does, because you *clearly* do not understand it - or you are using intentional hyperbole. You point to all this area that is zoned low density and claim dense housing is 'illegal' there (and btw 'dense' does not automatically mean 'affordable'). Do you know why it's zoned low density? *Because that's what they wanted to build there.* Land isn't zoned anything (under the city) before it gets annexed. It doesn't get annexed until the owner requests it, typically in preparation to develop something, and they propose zoning in line with what they want to develop. Zoning isn't arbitrarily determined by the city. In fact there's provisions in the code that *require* higher-density zoning based on location and proximity to services and size of proposal.

On top of that, zoning isn't permanent. It can be changed. It can be *requested* to be changed. It doesn't even have to *be* changed, there are these things called variances. If a developer wanted to buy up a block of detached homes and turn them into townhomes or apartments or whatever, it's entirely possible - there are ways to do that. Do you know what the biggest hurdle is?

NIMBYism. Anybody trying to do denser infill development faces an uphill battle because even if they *have* the zoning they need already, neighbors will come out of the woodwork bitching about traffic and noise and blocking mountain views and changing the character of the neighborhood - never mind if a rezone or variance was needed. Everybody hates zoning until it stops something they don't want from happening, and then look at all the sudden experts on how this and that 'violates zoning/development code'. And make sure we throw in 'evil developers just out for profit who don't listen to neighbor concerns' just for good measure.

"For what it's worth, you don't want to pay it off in 10 years.   Well, there's a nice psychological feeling to it but from a financial point of view, you get to take mortgage interest as a deduction to your income on taxes and that's worth enough that usually you want to pay off every other debt and leave the mortgage alone.   So, I would take out a 30-year fixed and just make the payments so when looking at a house, don't look at what you could pay off in a decade, but what payments you could make.  Also, for what it's worth, buying our first house was the most stressful financial decision that I've made and it's turned out to be the wisest in the long run - we put 2% down on ours.",t2_b4blz,Eloquent_Cantaloupe,0,1648656428.0,0,t1_i2qal43,i2qal43,False,rilezhill,t3_trweil,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortCollins/comments/trweil/this_shit_is_out_of_control/,This shit is out of control,/r/FortCollins/comments/trweil/this_shit_is_out_of_control/i2qal43/,3,r/FortCollins,0,3
