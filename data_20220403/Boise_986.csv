"Yes, big decline in the past few months.  I used to get really good coverage and at home, now, I'm lucky to get 1 bar.  It got so bad, I finally called them this last week after learning about cell towers so I could talk knowledgeably with them about the problem.

I noticed that I was getting full bars and 5G at the Village in Meridian, but drive half a mile away and coverage fell to nothing.  Towers are directional so they don't provide circular coverage (Omni-directional).  Just because you live near a tower doesn't mean the beam is pointed in your direction (Uni-directional, bi-directional, or tri-directional).  A lot of the towers in my area were uni-directional beaming North.  I was south of them.

I called Technical Support and had to get past the whole First Level nonsense like it was a phone issue.  Fortunately, I know tech speak and got around that pretty quick.  When I got to Second Level, they opened a ticket and said they were going to research the coverage problem.  They sent me a couple of texts asking if the issue was resolved, and I responded no.  The next day, they closed my case and sent me a ""form letter"" video link that said I live in an area without good coverage.  Their suggestion was to use wifi calling and explained how to turn that on.  I don't use wifi calling because it's limited and at the edge of the zone between the end of wifi and tower signal, the phone will effectively lock up trying to determine which service it's going to use.

This video was a cop-out in my book.  I called Tech Support again and asked why I had good coverage before but didn't any longer and referred to my original case number.  It was then I found out that over the past few months the old 3G towers are being turned off.  They called it ""Signal Redistribution.""  In theory, this isn't supposed to affect the voice bands, but in actual use, it is.  That technical support rep said there really wasn't anything I could do except to purchase a Signal Booster for $400 or up.  I said that was shit that I had to purchase something to get a signal I'd had for over 10 years before but he said that was the best he could do.

I hung up and called Customer Support.  This Rep said other towers were being activated but couldn't say when this might happen.  Coverage should improve when this is done.  I pulled out the safety-issue card because it really is a concern for me.  We live on a small acreage where wifi calling doesn't extend to the edges of the property.  We have livestock.  If something were to happen and I needed to call emergency services, I may or may not have a good enough signal.  As if to prove me correct, the signal started to get very nosy and fuzzed out a couple of times during the conversation, but didn't drop.  The Rep said they understood the concern and offered to send me, free, a Signal Booster to see if that would help.  I'm holding out to see how well it works, but that was a good move on their part.  I'll likely have it this week.

My advice, call and complain.  Make noise.  They know what's going on but won't stop with the current plan unless it starts costing them money.  I'm going to see how well the Signal Booster works, but ultimately, if I still can't get good signal, I'll have to see about switching services and have friends with other services come over and see what kind of coverage they have before I make a choice.",t2_bd8ll,Hydrogeology,0,1649007089.0,0,t1_i38vrou,i38vrou,True,peytoncurry,t3_tuxy6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/tuxy6j/terrible_phone_coverage/,Terrible Phone Coverage,/r/Boise/comments/tuxy6j/terrible_phone_coverage/i38vrou/,1,r/Boise,0,1

> population explosion has far outpaced the tower capacity 

You have a source for this? Other cities are growing even faster than Boise in terms of raw numbers. Are they having the same problem? Sounds like OP might have phone issue. Without trying a couple of different phones then OP's statement is unscientific anecdote.

> make serious investments here, 

They have been. In the last year or so the big 3 have started offering home home 5g internet that's cheaper than Sparklight or CenturyLink.  It's possible the rush to install 5G transmitters has hurt the 4G service, I guess.

> Yay deregulation, thanks Ronnie (Reagan)!

Can you imagine if AT&T was still monopolistic Ma Bell? Do you know how expensive a long distance call was back then? Even a call from Boise to Nampa was about $0.25 per minute. By the way, AT&T's breakup began during Nixon and Carter kept it up. Carter also deregulated the airlines. 

The competition in the cell phone space is far better than it was just 5 or 6 years ago. There are hundreds of MVNOs that have cropped up and if anyone is paying more than about $30/month for unlimited everything then they should start shopping around.

"Thanks again for sharing your experience. I'll be sure to give my kids appropriate guidance.

I'll share a bit of mine as well. I was raised in Hawaii and the SF Bay Area, so I didn't understand what being a minority was until I was out of College and visited France, Colorado, and Florida. I didn't see another Asian, let alone a person of color for days. Goddam! That's a lot of white people! Never seen that before. 

What I learned was that most people are broke or poor, desperately trying to keep their shit together one paycheck at a time. If you are fortunate enough to travel to different states or countries, and talk to many people, your perspective will change in many ways. 

As an Asian American man pushing 50, I can tell you that minorities can be racist, LGBT can be bigots, and there are assholes everywhere. Hating your JR high and high school experience is a very common experience. I can tell you that with effort, your life will get better.

Since your kids are already in elementary school it's likely they've already experienced some sort of racism. They may not have realized it and it might hit them in a couple of years that the things their classmates say to them are racist. In my experience the worst cases of racism were all in junior high. For my experiences, kids pulled up their eyes at me, said "" Ching Chong"", said how I was good at math because I'm Asian, COVID hit and people said stuff to me about how ""all Asians had COVID"" , and there's lots more but that's the common stuff.  I just want your kids to know that they shouldn't laugh along if someone is racist to them, it makes the situation worse. it helps if they know to call the racist kids out even though it's really hard. If they need to , have them get a teacher involved - in my situation recently my teachers genuinely cared about the incident and helped me through it. Make sure they are always proud of their culture despite the racist assholes.",t2_hoewx9i5,Frogs-r-fun,0,1648936173.0,0,t1_i35ltmu,i35ltmu,False,Frogs-r-fun,t3_tuq31i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/tuq31i/i_wish_i_didnt_feel_like_i_had_to_leave/,I wish I didn't feel like I had to leave,/r/Boise/comments/tuq31i/i_wish_i_didnt_feel_like_i_had_to_leave/i35ltmu/,10,r/Boise,0,10

"> I do a couple of days part time, in wine sales and education

I am 1000% sure that opportunity for wine educators exist in Portland. There are dozens if not hundreds of wineries in the countryside beyond the city. Wine isn't as big as beer here, but it's still huge.

And I am 100% sure that you could charge much much more for it. Not really sure what the problem is. But maybe you just don't like Portland. Which is totally fine too.

EDIT:

It also seems like if you are committed to living a really non-traditional, work a couple days a week only lifestyle, which is absolutely awesome and commendable, by the way-- then trying to buy a house is sort of a goal that most of us would not expect to be compatible with that lifestyle.

You just missed Treefort, but keep it in mind for next March.  It’s an outdoor music festival in downtown Boise that locals are super proud of.

If you are at all into bikes, check out the Goathead Fest and the Boise Bicycle Project.

Idaho has world class outdoor activities.  Rafting, fishing, hiking, climbing, skiing.  The green belt and the Boise River are right here and an easy entree to some of that.  If you are a fly fisher, make friends with the local fly shop owners/clerks and they’ll help you out.  If you aren’t one now, but want to give it a try, there are classes on how to cast and guides who will take out out.

The Boise Farmer’s Market is a big thing.  Produce, sure, but lots of other food, including lunch options.

The Treasure Valley has long been a refugee resettlement area and there are some great restaurants that come from that.  Kibrom and The Goodness Land come to mind.  You’ve already gotten lots of great Basque food recommendations, not sure if the Basque Market has been mentioned, but their paella (only available some days, check their website) is amazing.

"I work in tech but get paid about 1/3 of what I could make in those “liberal” states. We moved here because it *used to be* cheaper, but that’s no longer the case and the job market here is still crap. The jobs aren’t here - they’re remote. 

Albertsons is still Idaho’s biggest employer by an order of magnitude. Mostly low-wage service work. 

*People* are moving here in droves, often bringing *remote* work with them. Companies aren’t showing up yet, and are *less* likely to if they can’t attract & retain an educated workforce who feel comfortable raising their kids here. Being near last in education w/defunded libraries, worst-paid teachers, and religious witch-hunts in schools isn’t conducive to that. 

Micron reps, for one of Boise’s largest employers, have said “conservative” actions [‘threaten their longevity in the state’](https://boisedev.com/news/2020/12/10/micron-idaho-brad-little/). 

What Idaho has been doing recently is not “conservative” it is “Conservative” - meaning culture war religious & conspiracy-driven BS that *violates* small-c conservative “small govt” principles in favor of imposing their crazy on everyone else. Hate to break it to you. But neo-Nazis, bigots, stupid people & literal Taliban-like policies are not good for business.

And no, liberal policies clearly do not “destroy economies.” CA, NY, WA are among the largest economies *in the entire world,* and have propped up red states for decades.

"Hey! Welcome! I moved to Boise from Texas a year ago. If you aren’t outdoorsy, consider picking up outdoor hobbies because it will definitely improve your quality of life here if you can take advantage of just being outside. If you can ride a bike, use your bike to get around town! This place is just small enough that you can do a lot on a bike, and the green belt is honestly more convenient than drivig sometimes.

Also, food in Texas just wipes the floor with most food I’ve had in Idaho, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t gems here and there. There are a million breweries and they are almost all pretty good. Tango’s (empanadas), Funky Taco (fusion), Madhuban (Indian) are probably my top three restaurants, and I think all are local. Don’t go near most Mexican food joints in town unless you want your heart broken, but I’ve heard that there’s good Mexican (not sure if it’s Tex-Mex, Cali-Mex, or authentic) cuisine in Nampa and other surrounding towns. Also, because you said you’re from Houston, I would advise against ordering pho unless you’re at an actual pho restaurant (Pho Nouveau is the only one I think, but I haven’t tried it yet). Long story short, lower your bar just a little bit while you’re figuring out where to eat and you’ll eventually find things you really like!

As for tourist traps, there aren’t many “traps” because it still feels like a small town. Bogus Basin is worth the dizzying drive up for a nice hike, Freak Alley is a fantastically weird and small graffiti exhibit downtown, and Hyde Park is super small but kind of delightful and right next to Camel’s Back Park where you can hike up the hill and get a great view of the valley.

"Favorite eateries I can help with.

**Bacquet's restaurant:** Fantastic French food and their lunches are like 12-16 bucks so not too bad and well worth what you pay. You cannot find a fancier well prepared lunch for their price point. Everything on the lunch menu is fantastic. Their dinners range from 30-60 dollars a plate, also well worth it, but far less affordable than a 15 dollar lunch.

**Uncle Giuseppe's:** Basically a NJ/NY style deli and amazing sandwiches and cannolis. Their spaghetti, soups and lasagna are also top notch. expect 12 ish dollars a meal with an ability to go up to 20 if you go all out with dessert and soup.

**Tango's empanadas:** Best menu you will ever see for empanadas, inexpensive and damn delicious. A good 15 or so dessert options too, I recommend La Nona if you like banana for dessert. Something like 3.25 an empanada on average and 2-3 are a damn full meal

**Kibrom's Ethiopian and Eritrean:** fantastic Ethiopian food, if you are not used to it and/or not an adventurous eater this may not be the place for you. However if you are adventurous or love Ethiopian, do it. You are looking at 10-14 dollars a plate for a nice sit down meal.

**Janjou Pâtisserie:** truly the best quiche you can get for lunch, I want to say like 13 bucks for the quiche with a salad but I do not recall for sure. They have funky hours. Mostly this is a place for dessert, it is not cheap think 7-8 bucks on average for a dessert unless you get something less fancy there. But truly worth the treat from time to time.

&#x200B;

\-edit-

To add a few.

**CasaBlanca Cuban Grill:** I ate there a ton pre covid, sadly they are a bit out of the way so haven't eaten there in a year and a half.

"If you do the outdoors stuff, buy the state park pass for like $10/20 and get free entry to all the parks, it is like $5/6 each entry.

In town the best Thai place is Pad Thai House on Overland and Five Mile. Eagle surprisingly has a few good places, Bodacious Pig is really great BBQ, Schnitzel Garden down the road from there is awesome but pricey (the beef stroganoff is made with tenderloin). Cupbop is a local chain that does Korean style meat/noodles/rice and is really good.

"Bardenay Restaurant and Distillery has good food and they distill their own gin, vodka, and rum. Nice craft cocktails. German beer hall feel to the place. Laid back. While you're there go next door to the Basque Market, and across the street Bar Gernika is a cool spot (try the croquettes) and if it's during the day go check out the Basque museum as well. Boise has the highest concentration of Basque people outside of Spain so lots of Basque influence here.

Steelheads hockey games are awesome so check one out.

Great parks and the greenbelt for running, walking, and riding bikes. Extensive hiking trails in the foothills. Bogus Basin has great skiing and summer concerts, mountain biking, etc. Float the Boise River in the summertime. 

Honestly, I am a native Idahoan and I hate that so many people are moving here because it's really changed the quiet vibe around here. It is what it is though, and I don't have anything against anyone personally. Traffic is getting pretty heavy and the city is starting to get dirty. Lots of the fishing, hunting, and camping spots are getting overcrowded.

"Sooooo... are you looking downtown Boise or the central Boise area? The city is spread out and kind of blends into the surrounding cities. 

Lifelong Boisean and Realtor here so feel free to hit me up if you need help with anything. :)

Stuff I haven't seen mentioned:
8th Street Market on Saturdays in the summer! It's huge and fun to walk.  There are several farmers markets also.

Art in the Park in early September is AMAZING if you like Art. Free to get in and proceeds support the Art Museum

Concerts at Outlaw Field! Super fun, outdoors, and last I checked you could bring your own food/drink. Not sure about any post covid changes to that.  

If you like tabletop/board games check out All About Games.  They have a couple of locations. 

Hot Springs! There are lots of them around! Hike to then or drive to them.

Cherry Festival in Emmett

Shakespeare Festival is FANTASTIC and plays non Shakespeare  stuff too.

Gyro Shack- they're all over but I'm not sure if they're a thing outside of Idaho

"Forgive the double post, but I like to help, so here are some more ideas:

DOWNTOWN BOISE

\-[Boise Trolley Tours](https://boisetrolleytours.com/boise-trolley-tours): a quirky tour company with family-friendly tours that give a nice overview to Boise and our history.

\-[Boise Train Depot](https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/parks-and-recreation/facilities/boise-depot/): a historic and beautiful train depot that has a very nice view of our city. Sometimes the bell tower is open for an even better view.

\-[Bacon](https://baconboise.com/): a unique local restaurant that specializes in all different types of bacon. They've got other dishes, too.

\-[Center on the Grove](https://boisecentre.com/): in the heart of downtown Boise, within walking distance of the previously mentioned Basque Block, Capitol Building, etc. A lot of activities happen here like...

\-[First Thursday](https://downtownboise.org/events/first-thursday): as the name suggests, the evening of the first Thursday of the month during warm months there's all sorts of art exhibits, food/beverage tastings, live music, shopping experiences, and family activities.

\-[Capital City Public Market](https://www.capitalcitypublicmarket.com/): every Saturday they line the streets of downtown with local vendors like farmers, gardeners, artists, brewers, cooks, etc.

WEST BOISE

\-[Westside Drive-In](https://www.westsidedrivein.com/): a classic Americana drive-in with excellent food beloved across the area with signature dishes like finger steaks, prime rib, and the ice cream potato.

\-[Veterans Memorial Park](https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/parks-and-recreation/parks/veterans-memorial-park/): another serene park with nature trails.

EAST BOISE

\-[Idaho Botanical Garden](https://idahobotanicalgarden.org/): located next to the previously mentioned Old Idaho Penitentiary, multiple community-managed gardens with different themes and walking trails.

MERIDIAN

\-[Wahooz Family Fun Zone](https://www.wahoozfunzone.com/): kart racing, put-put golf, arcade, laser tag, etc.

MERIDIAN - THE VILLAGE

\-[The Village](https://www.thevillageatmeridian.com/): family-friendly shopping/restaurant center with picturesque outdoor walking areas, promenades, fountains, etc.

\-[Big Al's](https://www.ilovebigals.com/meridian/): huge bowling lanes, arcade, dining area with gigantic TV screens playing sports, serves huge portions of fun food.

NAMPA

\-[Warhawk Air Museum](https://warhawkairmuseum.org/): a huge hangar on an airfield that's been converted into a museum honoring military pilots from WWII to today.

"Depends what part of town you are in. By Overland Rd, New York Giant pizza and Goodwood BBQ are great. Also a Goodwood on eagle rd. 

Eagle Rd, yeah go to the Village. Yardhouse is a chain but I really enjoy it, but there's also matador and some other stuff in there. Huck House and Blue Buffalo are great breakfast spots, so is the Griddle and biscuit and hogs. Bardenay is nice, it's downtown or on Eagle Rd. 

Freddy's is a great fast food burger place. Get some fry sauce if you ain't familiar with it. Flying pie is okay for pizza, but it doesn't really drive me wild but they have a few spots all over town. Los Betos is great Mexican food, there's a few spots all over town as well.

If you want video games, go to VIP Games. There's indoor soccer at two places, one in Meridian and one in Boise. Indoor basketball at a place in meridian, I don't remember the name but it's an option. For gyms, depends where you are again because quality varies in the same brand just by location. Axiom is okay. Crunch is okay.

Some other places that deserve a shout: Brickyard, Barbacoa, Bittercreek, La Creme, Cinder winery.",t2_1gndzim,HateJobLoveManU,0,1648863720.0,0,t1_i324zwt,i324zwt,True,CharlesRichy,t3_tu2479,https://www.reddit.com/r/Boise/comments/tu2479/moving_to_boise_for_a_job_any_tipstricks_or_local/,"Moving to Boise for a job, any tips/tricks?

"Landlords are absolutely ruthless here. If you're renting do a VERY THOROUGH inspection with video & pics for move in AND move out. You are going to need it when you have to sue to get your deposit back.

If you like outdoorsy stuff, definitely check out the ridge to river trail system as a start. There's so much to explore even just right here near town. Options are virtually endless for outdoor activities in Idaho.

If the city life is more your style, I'd spend some time exploring down town during the weekend. We've got a decent amount of bars all within walking distance in the 9th and main area. I personally like taphouse & whiskey bar.

"This is gonna be basically a full guide to Boise tldr at the bottom.

Food - tangoes is very cheap and it's good argentinian empandas. Lemon tree is a great lunch place to get a hip sandwich. Funky taco is a California style taco place that's delicious. Wasabi sushi is the best sushi in town if that's your thing for a not outrageous price. Pie hole is a great place to get cheap pizza. Other than those honestly anywhere downtown will probably be pretty good.

Outdoors/parks - Boise is an outdoorsy town. As for parks check out Kristen Armstrong park, its got a cool fish walk thing, also right next to the greenbelt. The greenbelt is the coolest thing in the city it is a walk/bike path that goes along the Boise river, if you see one thing in Boise go take a walk or bike on the greenbelt (we have city bikes). Also renting or buying a raft and floating the river is a worthwhile experience in the summer. We have a reservoir just outside the city with a recreational area called Lucky Peak with is pretty nice. If you're looking for a place a bit more secluded I recommend looking up a place called ""naked rock,"" a great place me and my friends go swimming. If you're a hiking person google ""hiking guide Boise by Scott Marchant"" all of his books are quality. If you're a mountain biker I suggest checking out the military reserve area.

Entertainment - Not a highlight of Boise I'd say but not terrible. ""The Village"" is a nice place to go and spend an afternoon and shop around. Wahooz and roaring springs are two decent theme park we have here. If you like seeing movies I suggest checking what ""the flicks"" and the ""Egyptian theatre"" are showing as those are two unique theaters worth visiting.

Hip places - places worth walking around. 8th Street is the heart of our downtown and most boutiques and restaurants are local. 13th Street/camelsback is a nice older part of town. 

Coffee/drinks - dutch bros is *the* drink place around here, pretty good, make sure to Google the menu before going though as they don't typically show you a menu. ""The District"" has the highest quality coffee/drinks in town in my opinion. ""Flying m"" is a cute coffee shop that's open late and fun to chill at. I have no idea about bars sorry. 

General/culture - Try to avoid letting people know you're from out of town, like most growing places Boise doesn't like outsiders. However, expect people to be generally pretty nice to you here, it's a kind town. Idaho in general is very republican, but Boise is a bit of a mixed bag that leans democratic, we currently have a democratic mayor. Compared to a big city don't expect traffic really (we'll see in five years though). It get smoky for about 4-8 weeks a year here typically in July and August. There is essentially no public transit here, just a very very limited unreliable bus system. We have all 4 season here 5-15 days of 100+ and maybe 2 days we'll dip below 0 here and almost no rain. Good luck, if yah got any questions feel free to message me, I'm native to Boise.

"100% agreed. 

Biden, Trump, Obama, GW Bush, Clinton, Bush Sr., Reagan - they all sucked in many, many ways. Some more than others.

I don't know a single left leaning voter who truly likes Biden, let alone likes Biden or any other left-wing politician enough to fly a flag with their name on it outside of their house. It's insane to worship a public servant like that.

For example: I think the world of Katie Porter and the way she holds corporations accountable during congressional hearings, and she has a spotless public record - but the thought of flying a flag with her name on it (or even a bumper sticker) seems trashy.

"I likely can’t get pregnant because of some pre-existing conditions I have, but if I ever do I’m going to be high risk for complications similar to the woman in this article:

https://www.npr.org/2022/02/28/1083536401/texas-abortion-law-6-months

It makes me so angry, because if I do decide I want to try and start a family, now I have to weigh whether or not I’m comfortable with my personal risks and the fact I’ll need to drive several hours out of state for help if I have the “wrong sort of complication”. Whereas I might have kept a pregnancy before, I’m more likely to preemptively seek out an abortion, because the abortion ban made my personal risk for maternal mortality sky rocket. And I’m not the only woman who has to make a choice like that, which is part of why abortion rates don’t decrease with these bans even though women in poverty are forced to carry unwanted pregnancies.

"Criticizing Biden definitely means that I love Trump. ""If you disagree with me, then you're automatically best friends with my enemy"". You people are straight empty headed. Criticizing the choice of Biden during the primary and hoping for a different candidate automatically made me a Republican despite being a registered Democrat.

Biden keeps calling Putin a murderer to the public. Russia only supplies 3% of our oil. Biden had a direct affect on oil production in the US declining. Biden's sanctions have helped Russia become more independent, they have a gold standard for their currency now unlike us. The ridiculous spending under Biden (including in the infrastructure bill) has been a direct result of inflation for us and that has been known before the Russia war, which is merely an excuse at this point. Printing money causes inflation, full stop. I want reduced spending and an America first agenda. Money is not free and it comes out of all of our pockets whether directly or indirectly.

What happens when Taiwan gets invaded while our economy is crumbling and we're directly supporting the war against Russia by sending funds and troops? Spread resources too thin and that gives China an opportunity to completely destroy our microchip imports, which is already a huge problem.

There are massive problems in the US right now.

"That money would go a lot farther if we invested it in a light rail line instead of building another godawful highway.

Boise's beautiful, we don't need to mar that beauty with a beltway around the city, or another highway.

Edit: just to explore the idea a little further, where would you put the belt route? Along the foothills? Along state street? Would it be a raised highway, or are we demolishing some neighborhoods to widen roads and separate traffic?
