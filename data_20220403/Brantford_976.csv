I asked these mother fuckers not to preform a test because it usually makes me freak out and i feel sick or quickly pass out then come to - they did it anyways i had to go outside and get air afterwards as i was covered in sweat and about to pass out

The doctors kept me waiting HOURS for a enlarged nerve ive had since a child been to a specialist that monitored it half my childhood life  i explained this before they even started anything i explicitly told them what they will see -  then suddenly these fuck act like it was a worlds first and start to tell me they will attempt to pull my drivers licence if i didnt get a bunch of tests done

The optometrist didnt wear a mask (this was durning mid covid)  while telling me about potentially putting myself (my vision) in danger all the while this guys wearing his mask as a chin strap 2 inches away from my face

"You are stuck with rogers lines until bell installs fibre in your area. That could be this year, or next year, or the year after - who knows.

No matter which provider you get, it will be up to rogers to determine how reliable it is, unless bell fibre is available. Depending on where you are, that means its somewhere in the range of ""fairly reliable"" to ""completely unreliable"".

That said you can get lower prices and worse response time to outages by going with a reseller provider like teksavvy, start.ca, etc. or pay more, have worse customer service, and faster response times to outages by going directly with rogers.

"You're going to have a hard time with this.

Homes that old will have clay bricks and pure lime based mortar (putty) - not Portland cement based mortar like all modern houses use. If you use the latter with old clay bricks, it'll destroy the brick over time because Portland cement based mortar is much harder than the brick itself. Lime based motar is ""softer"" structurally, but it also has self healing properties that limit cracking. Unfortunately I've seen many older homes improperly patched with Portland and it sticks out like a store thumb.

Lime putty isn't something you can just go buy at the big box stores, it's something thats made by hydrating lime powder in water for months, sometimes upto a year. This is one of the reasons why it's harder to find guys capable of this type of work.

If you're able to find someone, make sure they're using lime putty and not Portland cement mortar. If they don't know the difference or try and tell you it doesn't matter, move on til you find someone that does.

Edit: here's a thread that kind of touches on the subject. I'd recommend calling supply houses that sell the hydraulic lime and see if they can recommend a mason / contractor that works with the stuff. https://www.diychatroom.com/threads/how-to-obtain-lime-mortar-for-repointing-in-ontario-canada.406538/",t2_4c12n,npno,0,1647990476.0,0,t1_i1q53yc,i1q53yc,True,GoldSeaworthiness,t3_tk86nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/brantford/comments/tk86nu/1800s_home_brickmortar_repair/,1800s home brick/mortar repair?,/r/brantford/comments/tk86nu/1800s_home_brickmortar_repair/i1q53yc/,6,r/brantford,0,6

"most retailers/business are considered private locations, not public areas, and its up to the business if they want to continue with it. Masks will still be worn on public transit, nursing homes, jails etc for a while. Beyond that, its personal preference, and I really hope people will be respectful, but I have my doubts.

Some will still wear a mask, some will never again unless they have to. My elderly Mother who is fighting cancer, has been told by her doctors to continue wearing them at places like Walmart.

"In Brantwood, around the area of Jennifer Court, used to be an old barn with a bunch of mattresses.  Local kids would jump off the barn onto the mattresses, until one girl got her pant leg stuck on a nail, missed the mattress and died.  Not sure if the Court is named after her or not, but I remember riding my bike out to the barn and hearing the story.

They said that back in the day, you could buy a teddy bear at Admiral's sub shop, and it would have drugs in it.

There was a secret party bar downtown called The Brantford Room, if you were at the Capitol theatre (Now Sanderson) you could see the party going on, but you could never get in.  You had to go to the back and know the password.  For years my friend and I tried to convince the patrons to let us in as they'd be looking out the front window and it looked like a great time.  Not so much a conspiracy theory but a bit of a little-known secret I think.

Another rumour was that the teddy bear had the password.

There was a guy with hook arms that used to walk around town swearing up a storm.  Really scared me one morning when I was downtown and he was just screaming, I thought at me, but really just the air, I guess.  Rumour was he was an electrician and electrocuted himself is how he lost his arms.  I'm probably mis-remembering, but I think he's the same guy who had that house on West Street that had the old cars painted silver and the sign 'Adoption not Abortion'.  The house still sits abandoned, as it was gifted to some natives who refuse to pay taxes on it.  

There was a truck driver who was murdered on the side of the 403 in town.  I saw the truck sitting there for a couple of days.  Rumour is a local prostitute or her boyfriend killed the driver.  She was a bit infamous, she operated her 'business' with a CB Radio which all the neighbours could hear due to interference on their televisions and radios, so her condo committee tried to get her to take down her antenna.  She called the newspaper and hung a flag on her antenna and said the condo committee was trying to take her flag down.

The Oxbow Road story, as I heard it was a couple teenagers went to make out back on Oxbow road, and unknown to them, someone had escaped from a nearby insane asylum.  The teenagers heard a noise, and the boy went out, but never came back.  The girl went out and found his head mounted on the car's antenna.  Scary for sure as a kid, but I don't believe there was ever an asylum out there, and plus a car antenna won't hold the weight of a head.

"I moved to Brantford early pandemic so it was a weird time to be moving to a new city. Things I like: 

\- Lots of great restaurants to try out. Favourites are Sociable, Healthy Rabbit and Everest Grill

\- Movie Theatre is great for new releases. Saw Free Guy, DUNE and Spiderman there. Friendly staff and they did their best with COVID. 

\- Decent variety of retail chains. For the most part we can find everything we need here.  

\- Surprisingly good pubic transit. It's reasonably priced to ride the bus and there is a bus almost every half hour during normal operating hours. Bus drivers are friendly. More than once I've spent some time alone just riding the buses and reading. 

\- Excellent libraries. They are modern and have exceptional selection. Friendly staff. The online resources are fantastic. I use Linkedin Learning for work. And I listen to a lot of audiobooks for free.  

\- The mall is okay. They quickly renovated the Sears area and it's really nice. I would like a Lulu Lemon and maybe some Tesla Charging stations though. 

\- Employment options are good here from what I've seen. I don't recommend retail though as it's not keeping up with inflation/cost of living. (if it ever did). If you are into trades or manufacturing it should be no problem to find something. They are doing something right with civic hiring too as Transit, Library and City Staff are all incredibly helpful and professional.  

\- There are a surprising number of specialty nerd shops... The Devils Bench, CaptCan Comics, Back in time Comics are all really great and have friendly owners.  

The big problem is the homeless and drug problem.  I donate to food banks and give people money when they ask. But I have no idea how best to solve this.

"A number of years ago (20 or so) my car was broken into in a secure parking garage in Toronto. Stereo was popped out and left on the floor of the passenger seat. CDs scratched but still there. Looking for cash or something to sell but there wasn’t anything worth taking I guess. It was a violation and felt horrible. Over time it gets better and you won’t think about it every time you get in your car or every time you triple check to make sure it’s locked. Sadly (different) car was rummaged through in my driveway more recently (10-12 years ago) and the only thing taken was an aux cord that was dropped on our lawn about 100’ away but the animals dumped out the diaper bag and threw everything around the car. It was accidentally left unlocked so no broken glass, no attempts to steal it but it took longer to recover from the second time because of the thought of the little punks touching things dear to my child. 

Can’t say I’ve ever typed that out anywhere before so thanks for anyone who read this far and for the OP it will get better and I am very sorry that you had to experience this. I hope that the police start to pay more attention to these incidents because it is things like this that will drive people out of the downtown and it always leads to larger issues and bigger thefts when the small targets are no longer available.

"They attempted to steal my husband’s truck 3 months ago. I heard them trying to punch the ignition and they got scared off once we turned an outside light on. Then they successfully stole the truck 1.5 months ago (we did it get back, because my husband put a tracker in his truck) but they took all his tools, his entire livelihood. Which pays our mortgage. 

Anytime I see a light go on outside past 11pm, I automatically freak out and have to get up and check to see if it’s the lights from his truck because someone is inside trying to steal it again. If I hear a car door in the middle of the night, same thing. We have literally been praising our dog for barking at the mailman, in the hopes that if it happens again, he’ll alert us.

"Massive amounts of petty crime. Almost expect your car to be broken in if you have anything in your car at all. 

It's also extremely dangerous to go out alone at night, especially as a woman, young adult, and/or child.

There's a pretty big drug problem and homeless problem, the apartment buildings near city Hall almost always have either Petty crimes or fires in the parking garage.

I might be a little bit salty about this but after living here for a year and a half, it's honestly not worth it.

You have the freedom of speech and expression is different. You don't have a right to speak whatever you say (in society) and not get reprisal for what you say. If you're a business and you politicize your business and you disenfranchise your customers that's your own choice. 

You're free to say what you want, but the free market of thoughts and money will reward or punish you accordingly.

BTW, it works both ways, for both right wing and left wing politics.

"These comments literally confuse me. Why is freedom so bad? Isn’t freedom what every individual wants? I wish to have the ability to make my own decisions, to be able to act and speak and think as I want without consequences. Obviously while maintaining the law and not causing harm to others. Individuals need to recognize that we are all different we all have different views and perspectives which should be okay and respected. But currently that’s not the world we are in. We don’t have those freedoms. I guess our charter of rights and FREEDOMS mean nothing and doesn’t apply to all. I don’t care if an individual is vaccinated or not, I am vaccinated and continue to choose love, kindness, and respect over division and hate. Take a good look at yourself and the world we are in now, and think morally and ethically, is what’s occurring correct or good?

"Re crime, story from Brantford Expositor today:

Calls for service to Brantford police are well above the national average and expected to increase as the city's population grows, said Saunders.    
In 2019, the national average for calls to police per 100,000 people was 38,371. In comparison, in 2019, Brantford police responded to 50,050 calls.   
While the Crime Severity Index, a measure of the seriousness of police-reported crime, continues to decline, Brantford is still higher than the national average.

I was wondering about the diversity, so we walked around Lynden Park Mall and we did see other cultures. We're a mixed family (Asian and Guyanese), but I've grown up in predominantly white neighborhoods and have experienced every sort of racism. Right now we live in Brampton, so it's the opposite of that. Very diverse and lots of 1st/2nd generation immigrants.

"Live in Brantford for 40 plus years. Ive seen the good and the bad.

Theyre are areas that definitely have a community feel, where neighbors know each other and look out for each other.

The new builds in west brant are expensive but there are many families in the area. Two newly built well designed schools with more resources than some others.

Only area I would try to avoid is East Ward near downtown. 

It actually is a city on the rise with more and more families moving here.

You will here many horror stories that are exaggerated.

As an original industrial city that has slowly shifted to more service industry employment there are still many jobs available. Pay may not always be the best though.

I live near the hospital (Terrace hill area) for 11 years now and have not had any serious issues with theft or destruction of my property.

All in all its not a bad place to live. 
Brand new YMCA, Library and renovated Wayne Gretzky sports center give lots of opportunity for children and adults alike.

"My family moved here about 5 years ago. We live in the north-east end of the town. A bit of a millenial-aged area (built in the 80s) and we love it. Moved from Hamilton. While not as diverse and a few less things to do, it's growing and if you go searching, you will find things all the time. I haven't run into the drug problems and theft issues that everyone keeps talking about yet, but that could be just because I grew up in a rough part of Hamilton and know all about that stuff.

We also have an autistic son, and there is plenty of support for him here, surprisingly. There's Lansdowne and Gregory School/Kaylana Support systems, if you require that type of therapy for your kids. 

Beyond Glenhurst and the Bell homestead, there's also the twin valley zoo, and pretty close to African Lion Safari, pretty close to Paris, St. George, and plenty of Farmlands all over the place, if you are into that kind of things. We live near Brantwood Farms, and they hold several gatherings and festivals all season long, great for the kids to get some fresh air and have some fun.

There's also the waterpark, we visited it for the first time last year, and it was a blast. We have two young children so it was nice to get some relief from the heat. Not the biggest (at least, not compared with Wild Water Works in Hamilton) but it's good enough. Also, very affordable.

Plenty of trails, lots to fish, if you like shooting, there's Urban Tactical. Great place, you can go shooting there without a license. 

My only gripe, just wish it was a little more diverse. Most of the population is Caucasian and for a visible minority, you can sometimes feel the judgement. I found a Cuban barber shop there and it's nice as hispanics are not very well represented there.

Hopefully that's enough information, I thought maybe an insight from a minority might be something to put out there as well.",t2_65puy,Buzzword33,0,1644852470.0,0,t1_hwx15x5,hwx15x5,True,mj99kb,t3_srsxor,https://www.reddit.com/r/brantford/comments/srsxor/thinking_about_moving_our_family_to_brantford/,Thinking about moving our family to Brantford.

"My boys were raised in Mississauga and my daughter-in-laws are from Brampton and Toronto. I have a grandson here in Brantford in junior kindergarten. He sounds out and reads simple words but that's due to home life I think, because teachers were really surprised he can do it. Makes me think kids here are behind what you're used to. I think combination of less exposure at home in the younger years and funding. 

MOST schools here barely passed standard testing. See link below example - every category more than half of students do not meet requirements. I can't explain it. Best schools I hear in West Brant and in the Catholic board.

We left a bike in our car port one day and it was stolen overnight. My family in Hamilton has been saying the same thing is occurring there. This isn't something that is very surprising in hindsight, but as a new homeowner, I did not anticipate it.

For location and amenities, Brantford is great. There is a movie theater, plenty of restaurants, and, hopefully soon, a Costco. Lococos in Brantford is great. For other grocery stores, I usually travel to the Paris Nofrills as it is a bit nicer.

The neighborhood you move to has a large impact on how prevelant the drug issues are. The downtown area (Colborne to Grey, Stanley to West) show these issues the most in my opinion.

Overall, I am loving Brantford, and don't anticipate moving out of it anytime soon.",t2_1528h8,dourazel,0,1644788702.0,0,t1_hwtw350,hwtw350,False,mj99kb,t3_srsxor,https://www.reddit.com/r/brantford/comments/srsxor/thinking_about_moving_our_family_to_brantford/,Thinking about moving our family to Brantford.

"Brantford for many years was 100% industrial. Jobs were plentiful, and pay was good. Then in the 70s things changed, and to a great extent, the industry left. Branford is now a university town. It is cleaner now, and the downtown is much nicer. There are drugs in Brantford, but I honestly do not think it is any worse here than anywhere else, regarding that. 

Of course, there is the Bell Homestead, but once you have seen it, you have seen it....and Glenhurst Gardens. And the Gretzky Sports Complex. And Mohawk Park. 

It's an ok town, as much as some people like to criticize it. I live in an older part of the city, and I like it because nothing ever changes here.

">In April, the same townhouse complex was the scene of Brantford’s first homicide of 2021.
Isaiah Castillo, 20, was shot in Unit 65 at 77 Diana Ave. just after midnight on April 14, in what police say was a targeted attack. Castillo later died in hospital.

>On May 7, a 17-year-old who cannot be named under the Youth Criminal Justice Act was charged with first-degree murder in Castillo’s death. Later, Taylor Brian Pasco, 25 of Stoney Creek, Ont., was charged with conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit robbery and several firearms offences.
