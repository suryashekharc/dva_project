"My life's in kind of a weird spot right now.  I'm starting to look at apartments to move into in July (before anyone says anything, yeah, I know about the ATL Housing subreddit), but my financial situation is in a bit of a holding pattern until I find out what's going on with my student loans.  

I have a fair amount in my savings, but most of it will go toward a down-payment once I have to start paying it back, and the amount that I'd feel comfortable paying in rent is highly dependent on how much I still end up owing once they make some sort of decision.

My social life is dominated by looking for free events, since I want to save up as much money as possible (again, I'll probably lighten up about that a bit, depending on what, if anything, happens), but that really limits what I can do with COVID restrictions starting to loosen.

I know I'm in a much better spot than most people (employed at a job I don't hate, with at least a small semblance of a social life and not literally living paycheck-to-paycheck), but I just wish that the medium-term future was a bit more clear right now, as it feels like I can't plan much until I know how everything will turn out.",t2_f4kqq,Gutterball1234,0,1648992738.0,0,t1_i37z6pp,i37z6pp,True,AutoModerator,t3_tv5gtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tv5gtx/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_april_03_2022/,"/r/Atlanta Random Daily Discussion - April 03, 2022",/r/Atlanta/comments/tv5gtx/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_april_03_2022/i37z6pp/,2,r/Atlanta,0,2

Here's the **real** pro tip if you are not checking bags.  Skip the domestic terminal completely.  No north side/south side.   None of that.  Go to the International terminal.  It is so quiet and calm it's like flying out of a small airport.   Just check in online with whatever app your airline uses.   Security lines are nothing like Domestic.    Then hop on the train to whatever terminal you need.

"Yep! Though if you go during peak international departure times, the wait may actually be longer than the domestic terminal.  It's frowned upon by TSA and the airport, but they can't turn you away.  Also no checking bags if you're not flying Delta.  Still, F is a great place to hang out if you have some time to kill before departure.  It's quiet and relaxing compared to the domestic terminal.  And if you have access, the Delta SkyClub in F is also the best one in the airport in my opinion.",t2_6egtc,funbob,0,1648851646.0,0,t1_i31glom,i31glom,False,AutoModerator,t3_ttmn7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/ttmn7k/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_april_01_2022/,"/r/Atlanta Random Daily Discussion - April 01, 2022",/r/Atlanta/comments/ttmn7k/ratlanta_random_daily_discussion_april_01_2022/i31glom/,1,r/Atlanta,0,1

"A lot of people who previously wouldn't have thought to carry a gun to... a roller rink, a bowling alley, a Dairy Queen, a McDonalds, Publix, etc are now going to be interested/emboldened/enabled in doing so, because Republicans made a big to do about it.

I actually don't feel safer with more people bringing more guns to more places, because I am fully cognizant that we have a lot more gun owners in America than we have \*responsible and competent\* gun owners. And we certainly have too many people who are mentally and emotionally poorly equipped to de-escalate human conflicts already, without adding guns into the equation.

The data doesn't lie. [Gun violence crimes increased 13 to 17% in states that passed these laws, out of step with the increase in other rates of crime over the same period.](https://news.stanford.edu/2017/06/21/violent-crime-increases-right-carry-states/)

[Gun assaults of police officers and gun thefts also increased.](https://www.americanprogress.org/article/concealed-carry-linked-increased-gun-violence-wisconsin/)

Just because carrying a gun everywhere might make the most insecure and paranoid among us \*feel\* safer, doesn't mean it actually does make anyone safer. And in fact, if you're the kind of person scared to death to go in public without a gun in the course of your daily life, you're probably the last person who should have access to one.",t2_2bl0uct,Rawr_Tigerlily,0,1648842370.0,0,t1_i30v9yh,i30v9yh,False,ATL30308,t3_tto0eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tto0eu/man_on_a_date_charged_in_womans_murder_after/,"Man on a date charged in woman‚Äôs murder after fight over bowling ball, Atlanta police say",/r/Atlanta/comments/tto0eu/man_on_a_date_charged_in_womans_murder_after/i30v9yh/,10,r/Atlanta,0,10

"These people aren't buying expensive homes. I've been looking for over 2 years over half the houses were corporate owned this is the sw/west side. I lost two houses to firms outside of Atlanta. The rise has been steady aka normal and they have been building the whole time. They are literally finishing 280 town houses no one can afford because cooperate buyers bought all the single family homes. If its under 250k its been ruined by flippers or bought as investments. Capping investors will increase the amount of affordable homes you can deny it but its true.  Also on your chart you'll noticed its staring leveling off so where are the homes?

They never stopped building but the investors also never stopped buying. In addition to those 280 town homes two different set of apartments were finished and 3 condo complexes you just need a 700K to get them and most are vacant still. I literally watched two house get built just in my neighborhood that were gone before hey were even finished. I tried to buy one of them and they were like its sold they didn't even have the doors on. They are clearing lots all over the southwest side building is insane right now.

For people buying 400K+ homes cooperate buyers are not an issue but if you come down here by the poors its huge issue.",t2_6kpy0j7f,randycomesup,0,1648831859.0,0,t1_i30563e,i30563e,False,sebeku2,t3_tta2lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tta2lm/federal_report_officially_lists_metro_atlanta/,Federal report officially lists metro Atlanta housing market as ‚Äòunaffordable‚Äô,/r/Atlanta/comments/tta2lm/federal_report_officially_lists_metro_atlanta/i30563e/,1,r/Atlanta,0,1

">Well one of the first things cadets are taught when dealing with a person of interest is ask if they have a weapon on them.

Were you a police cadet?

When people are questioned by the police they typically are already in trouble, its not that possession of the firearm got them into trouble. The police in general are ignorant to the concealed possession of a firearm until someone tells them so. 

Hence this doesn't really seem to do as much as you would think in reducing violence or possession by criminals.

"Same situation here, I bought my second house for $280K nearly 3 years ago, now it's worth $440K.  I would sell it because developers are building more crap near my home but if I do sell it that profit would mean nothing because it'll all be eaten up with another home purchase. 

The only way it would benefit me is if I move completely out of the Atlanta area.",t2_awjizrw8,cant_pick_anything,0,1648820735.0,0,t1_i2zdt8b,i2zdt8b,False,sebeku2,t3_tta2lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tta2lm/federal_report_officially_lists_metro_atlanta/,Federal report officially lists metro Atlanta housing market as ‚Äòunaffordable‚Äô,/r/Atlanta/comments/tta2lm/federal_report_officially_lists_metro_atlanta/i2zdt8b/,4,r/Atlanta,0,4

"Flooding the streets with guns is surely going to help as well. 

I‚Äôm all for first amendment rights, when you have a permit. 
But having 18 year old kids running around Atlanta with tons of guns and no oversight is stupid. 

Arresting kids with hand guns is one of the biggest ways we stop potential gun violence.

"And how would that stop investors from just going and buying those up too?

That is the issue.

I watched an interview this past Sunday with some guy from Canada who said his real estate investment company just bought over 800 homes in the Atlanta area in the last 2 months.

Its groups like this that are the problem.

My son and his wife lost the bid on a house to one of these companies as couple of weeks ago.  They were out bid by $1800.

They were lucky that this company didn't bother to do their HOA research.  One of the bylaws is that they owners of the house have to live in the home for 2 years before they can use it as a rental. So the deal fell through and since they were the 2nd highest bid, they got the house. This was just this past Wednesday.",t2_nvwzv,Velvetrose-2,0,1648820350.0,0,t1_i2zcyoj,i2zcyoj,False,sebeku2,t3_tta2lm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/tta2lm/federal_report_officially_lists_metro_atlanta/,Federal report officially lists metro Atlanta housing market as ‚Äòunaffordable‚Äô,/r/Atlanta/comments/tta2lm/federal_report_officially_lists_metro_atlanta/i2zcyoj/,1,r/Atlanta,0,1
