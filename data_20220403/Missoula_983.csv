The bars need to fix the drunk driving problem? It’s impractical to put that responsibility on restaurant and bar staff. You can’t know for sure how many drinks a person has already had before they enter your establishment.   How about increasing the consequence of blowing over? It’s remarkable how many drivers are out there with multiple DUI’s. How are you allowed to keep your license?  It is essentially legal to drive drunk in Montana. That’s the problem.

">The hard numbers show that the number of available rentals goes down as well as the investment and maintenance of existing rentals.

In the case of that MA study (from 2007) it was based on owners selling units rather than continuing to rent them. At the same time MA repealed conversion regulations - so if it were possible to mass-sell units in Missoula too it could be curbed by not allowing them to convert as many (or any at all) individual units into condos to sell. It also notes the reduction in investment of maintenance was in ""smaller items of physical damage"". When landlords do that type of maintenance they do it in between tenants, when tenants have rent control they stay longer, it's easy to extrapolate from that why there's a reduction in that type of maintenance. The tenants obviously preferred cheaper rent and a stable place to live.  

>I'd love to see anything that would back up your assertation that rent control would in any way increase the quantity of rentals.  

The first one is the MA study you linked, they found that new development was unaffected (you misrepresented the data). So even with being disincentivized by implementing rent control they still wanted to build more. Combine that with limiting the conversion of individual units and you end up with an increase in quantity - likely exponentially more in Missoula based on the incentive I already explained combined with our demand.  

Another is for the entire state of California evidenced by Census data. For context they have pretty loose rent control based on inflation but it's capped at 10%. From 2009-2019 the median rent only went up $300. I don't have the numbers for literal number of rental stock but the number of vacant units went down in line with the number of renters who went up, so that suggests at the very least the same case as the MA study (unaffected even with the disincentive of rent control).  

Ultimately the decrease in stock you brought up is from allowing owners to sell individual units instead if entire buildings, and an incentive to build new is created by rent control.",t2_4m9oa,TopScruffy,0,1648779973.0,0,t1_i2xluh5,i2xluh5,False,misterfistyersister,t3_tt4m6j,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/tt4m6j/what_local_businesses_are_making_missoula_worse/,What local businesses are making Missoula worse?,/r/missoula/comments/tt4m6j/what_local_businesses_are_making_missoula_worse/i2xluh5/,3,r/missoula,0,3

"I moved here in 2012, so I hadn't heard that story. Yeah, that's a bad faith move for sure. I wish people did what they said they'd do, and breaking a contract is the opposite of that obviously. And I disagree with it. I agree with you on this point as being a quality unbecoming of a member of our community. He purchased the Wilma around then? If so, the question is this: did he agree to the contract terms, or inherit them with the purchase? If the answer is the latter, that adds a new element to this equation.

I remember venues like Stage 112 and The Palace and I saw some killer shows there. Zion I and Nappy Roots at stage 112 were two of my favorite shows, and Lyrics born at the Palace. Awesome memories. And now that you mention it I'm sure the Top Hat's success came at the cost of losing those places. But its important to note though that in a free market, consumers vote with their dollars. So if they offered an experience that folks wanted to vote for with their dollars, they'd still be around. 

Yeah 100% I see your point in the last portion - it'd be crazy to see data about the influence the music scene largely created by these businesses and the kettlehouse's venue have contributed to people moving here! That could be a negative impact on the community.

"I used to think it was a good idea too until someone challenged me to look for economic research papers on the impact of rent control.

This paper changed my mind: **Out of control: What can we learn from the end of Massachusetts rent control?**[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119006000635](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119006000635)

Did some more digging and the results have been replicated anywhere rent control previously existed and was repealed. The hard numbers show that the number of available rentals goes down as well as the investment and maintenance of existing rentals.

I'd love to see anything that would back up your assertation that rent control would in any way increase the quantity of rentals. I looked as hard as I could in the student research databases at Mansfield Library and couldn't find any numbers to support that.

"Thanks for taking the time to put together a reply with some substance! I appreciate it.

Your first point I don't quite understand. What's wrong with the Top Hat being a restaurant? Is it a problem that food is served there? 

TIF financing of projects is a complex issue and I understand why it's controversial, so that could be fair. It could be argued that the result is a net benefit to us as taxpayers and as members of the community. Important to note that it didn't actually happen though.

As for screwing over Knitting Factory... isn't knitting factory a pretty big outfit? Pretty sure they've got venues all over the country, if not in other countries too. Not sure how he'd have screwed them over. 

As for the big sky meeting bit, yeah that sounds like it would be a rude thing to do!

The last bit is pretty shady for sure. Not the wanna be politician thing, we all want to be something. The hospitals part though. Wonder if this can be verified?

And I am certainly not trying to make a claim that there are any authentic Mexican options in Missoula. Your reasoning for there not being options is that there aren’t any Mexicans here and I can’t argue with that fact. My issue isn’t as much with people who bemoan the lack of authentic food options. My issue is with people who act all holier than thou about it (which I don’t feel like you were doing) and look down on those who like the food that Missoula has to offer. I can recognize and understand that something isn’t authentic and still think it tastes good.

"Ugh.

"“We cannot criminalize homelessness,” said code compliance supervisor Charmell Owens. “You can cite for other issues like garbage, debris, right-of-way storage, but in order to cite for camping in the city we have to have available housing. Some people will take those resources, and some will not.”

Aka the do nothing at all approach and let campers trash your city.

Once you see this happening, it only spreads until the population gets fed up and turns against city government. 

See what is happening in regard to People for Portland and the city. Citizens are ready to enact drastic policies like 1000 person open air shelters manned by the National Guard. Yes that was a real proposal. 

The challenge there is that hardline activists call for housing first and block all action against urban camping. Problem is you can’t just induce demand for housing by providing it to anyone who ends up homeless in your region from another.

This is a national burden forced onto Western cities because these people cannot survive year round elsewhere. Until climate is acknowledged as a homeless migration driver, there is no progress against urban camping.",t2_bcr8ce5l,MuddyFizzBop,1,1648653144.0,0,t1_i2q2fsp,i2q2fsp,True,FastidiousFalcon,t3_ts89lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/ts89lz/officials_face_challenges_with_clearing_occupied/,Officials face challenges with clearing occupied vehicles from Missoula streets,/r/missoula/comments/ts89lz/officials_face_challenges_with_clearing_occupied/i2q2fsp/,-12,r/missoula,0,-12

"Strangely enough, I, the person is not important. I've only decided to champion an important cause because the fucks in charge decided they want to hurt me and those I love for sitting the Truth.

What gets me though, is that everything I learned came from Missoula. I have an honorable discharge from the USAF with 8 years of service after being crushed in a training accident. I had no criminal record before the city decided to fabricate their bullshit. I've spoken ask over the world, in front of the United Nations. I've been on every single major news network in the world. I've spoken to politicians of every flavor... President Obama, Drumph, and Biden all have been briefed on who I am because I've brought to light every thing I witnessed that poisoned my beloved military.

I've gone above and beyond anything that was ever required of me, and yet... People like you just decide to shit on me because you feel like it. I fight for the people. My own people, and they turn on me every fucking chance they get. 

Really, I'm not mad, though my language is harsh, it's purposely done because I'm done with all the lies.

The City punished my mother. They made my bail twice the legal limit under the Montana state constitution and my mother put up her retirement, causing her to delay her retirement. Then, after I'd been acquitted of everything and the city was exposed to be the shit bags that they are, the People still have been horrible to my family and I.

They stole my home, tried to wreck my life. Gwen Jones and the lot should have been politically hung, and yet everyone attacks me even though I did nothing wrong. The asshole who made the video, is getting money directly from the cock of the military industrial complex. He bathes in the golden shower of the corrupt. And yet... Where the fuck is my justice?

Where are my people? Because I will fight this all by myself and win if I have to spit in the eye of the devil himself. Now you can join me, and actually try to fix this mess, or you can get out of the way while the adults do the true work.

"From the article:

>MCPS has been testing its water for several years on a voluntary basis, because we believe this information is important for the health of our school communities. In 2020, the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services created a new rule requiring schools to test for lead at least every three years. A full description of the sampling process and requirements for schools can be found on the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ [deq.mt.gov]) website.

So perhaps the difference in sampling protocol (taking from every water source) made it harder to hide the lead problems. Maybe they were just testing it and not doing anything about the numbers, but now they are required to actually care.

"What we really need is for the city to offer a subscription service called sidewalk crate, where every month each homeowner gets a new square foot of concrete delivered through their window which they can place over any degraded sections of concrete on their property.

Really though, why are we messing with this system at all? Now someone’s job at city government is going to be managing 20 year financing on sidewalk assessments. It’s a complex solution meant to put a bandaid on the financial difficulty of lower and middle class homeownership. Unfortunately, bandaids like this prop up an unfair system. They make it /easier/ for cost of housing to remain outrageous. They make it /easier/ to underpay an employee. If a homeowner can’t find a way to pay back the city for sidewalk repairs within a year, they probably won’t be a homeowner for long. The city doesn’t give me low interest loans for my unexpected medical bills, vehicle repairs, or other home repairs. Why sidewalks? If a homeowner is really struggling through little fault of their own, they can ask for a deferred payment due to economic hardship. That should be rare though, not the norm.

Lastly, is someone really suggesting that the city just pay for all sidewalk repair out of the general fund? What a terrible idea. It’s easier to throw out salt and hack away at packed ice than it is to shovel snow early and often. Speaking from personal experience as an idiot: salt and rock bars damage sidewalks. If homeowners are responsible for maintaining sidewalks but not fixing them when broken, they’ll do a worse job taking care of them.

"All great questions! I'm not sure equity is an achievable goal nor do I think it is a sound strategy for promoting more public funds in creating a complete, well-maintained sidewalk network. I also don't believe using the general fund is a great argument either.

Step one should be identifying the key pedestrian zones of Missoula and focusing there first. This means anything west of Reserve street is probably not a good fit for publicly supported sidewalks. A complete sidewalk network's value comes from being a reliable, complete network of non-motorized pathways for all residents. We would never tolerate a random dirt road in the middle of town, but you can find houses without sidewalks in most neighborhoods in town. Likely long-time residents who can't afford the work or aren't interested in it happening. 

Of course, there are folks who don't need assistance to complete their mandated sidewalk/curb work and for them, the current system is likely working just fine. For the rest of Missoula, an income-based support system where a portion of the sidewalk is publically funded is probably a better long-term strategy than having more folks taking on long-term debt. I think that this is a smaller task than folks make it out to be. Most of Missoula has good sidewalks already because sidewalks tend to last a very long time and are a sound public investment.",t2_4gxn06pj,BiffWebster9000,0,1648571984.0,0,t1_i2l0qjw,i2l0qjw,False,BiffWebster9000,t3_tr1mia,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/tr1mia/who_should_pay_for_sidewalks/,Who should pay for sidewalks?,/r/missoula/comments/tr1mia/who_should_pay_for_sidewalks/i2l0qjw/,3,r/missoula,0,3

"Sidewalks have always seemed like a thing where if the city is forcing a homeowner to install/replace/repair a sidewalk, and the homeowner has no say over who/how/what/when or NO, then it should be the city paying for the whole project.

Yes, everyone's taxes should go toward building/maintaining the sidewalks. Taxes go toward repairing streets, why are sidewalks different? Sidewalks aren't owned by the home owner. The homeowner is not allowed to go modify the sidewalk if they want to. They're not an asset when selling the home. ""Has sidewalk"" is not a check box on any sell sheet I've ever seen.

Yeah, people will argue they don't want their taxes going to someone else's sidewalk when they don't have one themselves. But, ya know, how's this different than a park, a bike path, the road you live on? I don't have a park in my front yard, but I can go enjoy the parks in town.

"The IRC is a huge scam and has been for years. Follow the money. 

In 2020, they spent $93 million on refugee programs in the US, such as occupancy, vehicles, travel, communications, etc. 

That same year, they brought in $825 million in revenue. This means they spend just 11% of revenue on helping refugees resettle in America. 

A whopping $101 million is spent on management expenses and fundraising. 

Are they helping refugees? Certainly not as much as they're helping themselves.

"So what percentage of refugees are being placed in other parts of MT? 
This article seems to say that all are being resettled in Missoula.

“Missoula’s ceiling for resettlement is set at 120 refugees a year, which comes out to about 25-30 families. Last year 115 individuals came in family groups and we are on track to receive another 110 individuals this year, which means that Missoula continues to be close to the goal for resettlement, despite a national downward trend. Mary explains that this is a big deal, as some resettlement communities have been struggling to meet their limit. She says that in part, Missoula’s success is due to Missoula itself and how Missoula has been able to provide for refugee families.”

“Soft Landing was born out of a need and a desire to help refugees not only enter into the Missoula community, but to thrive in it. Approximately 300 people have been resettled in Missoula, from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Syria, and Iraq.”

"Adding to your good advice: the fire insurance maps are often called Sanborn maps after the insurance company that made them (around here anyway). The earliest ones in Montana often contain many neat little details about building uses (eg, “Frank residence - cobbler”), while post-1900 they tend to be more professional (strictly limited to structure location and primary building material). 

I just checked and about half of the slant streets were covered by sanborn maps starting in 1912. Before that, only a couple blocks. Most of it was covered by 1951 and the last sanborn I could find was 1958.

I've had angry illegal passing on Higgins because im stopped for deer in front if me or the guy who was pissed he had to slow down behind me while I slowed down because a vehicle was entering the road from a blind spot. Or the people who honk because you're not out in the middle of the intersection to turn without being able to see the flow of traffic.  It's literally the responsibility of drivers to observe flow of traffic and road conditions, not be entitled to the max speed limits at all times. It was quite easy for the man in the truck's position behind me to turn his head slightly to the left and observe why I was waiting. I swear a lot of drivers here can't see beyond the bumper in front of them. That said I simple turned around and gestured at the man crossing the road.

Lol. But mythbusters proved they are faster than 4 way stops.

"I gotta agree with u/PlumSome3101 on this. I've driven here for 30 years in Missoula and surrounding towns. I thought we were all pretty normal until I started traveling in my early 20s. I actually think our issues have gotten better with the transplants, not worse! I personally think the issue is mostly the ""locals"" - especially in Missoula itself. It's not just slowing down either. I think the issue can also be the opposite as well - people too slow in a given situation. 3 fold:

1. Entitlement, no sense of courtesy at all - Montana independence attitude (which I actually love! Just not while driving).
2. Paying absolutely zero attention - whether that's while driving too fast or too slow or doing something that is a bad idea in the given situation.

"Pretty cool from a historical perspective. I don't want to sound like a downer and discourage you here... but as professional remodeler/home flipper for almost 20 years, I have to point out some things I'd be concerned about at this point. Take this for what it is - free advice. But, if you are my friend I'm going to tell you some concerns - definitely don't just start ripping off siding/drywall cause you want a log home - very unlikely anything about this would be this easy for 1. But also, I'd have some major concerns about what I just purchased and if it was disclosed that was a log home or not. In my mind, there are a LOT more negatives than positives on what you just found. Maybe it's all great because everything is in great shape? But the fact that you didn't know this before purchasing makes me very concerned:  


1. Original log homes using construction of that era (and basically most pre 1970s ish), did NOT have an indefinite life expectancy. Your average 1930s log homes would usually last around 50 years tops without major structural rehab. There are older ones today - yes. But, that is most often because major rehab has occurred.
2. A log home (even a recently built one) is more expensive to maintain regardless.
3. A log home is often more expensive to insure. Why? See points 1 and 2.
4. The drywall and siding actually gives you a big insulation/draftiness improvement. Those logs look like they have no chinking (a very expensive and labor intensive process to add)! Consider carefully before you start breaking up drywall and siding. Also, consider that a lot of the wiring and plumbing might be between your logs and your drywall as likely is additional insulation and possibly toxic materials (asbestos etc).
5. I'm not a log home expert specifically (though I had one in the family who built them professionally all over the country), I'm not 100% sure on this but I believe the lack of breathability with walls over logs might be an issue and you might have high risk of rot.
6. Covering a log house was something is often what people did to hide major structural issues like rot. Most log home issues start to occur in the bottom logs (i've personally replaced them a few times, jacked homes up and cut logs out to replace bottom rotten logs, it's common!) If you can see these (say from a crawl space), i'd want to look and see what kind of shape stuff is in ASAP.

Sorry to sound like a downer, but i'm just being honest. Everything might be fine / great.

Breakfast - #1 Market On Front. The Breakfast Club and Veera Donuts have great burritos, but call/order ahead... They can be crazy busy and i, personally, can't wait 30 min. for grab n' go breakfast.

"**[Firearm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firearm)** 
 
 >A firearm is any type of gun designed to be readily carried and used by an individual. The term is legally defined further in different countries (see Legal definitions). The first firearms originated in 10th-century China, when bamboo tubes containing gunpowder and pellet projectiles were mounted on spears to make the portable fire lance, operable by a single person, which was later used effectively as a shock weapon in the Siege of De'an in 1132. In the 13th century, fire lance barrels were replaced with metal tubes and transformed into the metal-barreled hand cannon.

"Blue Ribbon has gone downhill drastically the last few years, avoid them at all costs. I used to spend the extra coin with them because they were the best but no more. I ordered a new topper, and was treated like a king until they got my payment. After that, piss-poor customer service.  When the topper finally arrived the windows wouldn't slide open. They tinkered with it by adding silicone lubricant and gave up when that didn't work.  They sent me home and wanted me to make another appointment with them after they spoke with the manufacturer......after calling 3 times with no return calls, I finally went to another shop who aligned the tracks correctly at no charge.

"First and foremost, as you say, the (new) law doesn't specify.  And I think that's the most authoritative thing we can say with any certainty.

However, if we assessed it in the same way as existing traffic laws, it's not so much a question of ""right of way"" - it's more that whoever is to the rear has a responsibility not to run into whoever is in front of them.  That's how we typically decide who was ""at fault"" in an accident.  To put this another way, it has a bit to do with our spacial perception driving on the road - there's always room to put a motorcycle between any two cars with reasonable drivers, and probably multiple of them.  So the question is less whether to allow the motorcyclist in at all, but more what to do once they're in the space.

So, if a motorcyclist needs to enter the space between your front bumper and the car in front of you, you have a responsibility not to close the distance and run them over, in the same way they you have a responsibility not to hit any other car in front of you, even if a 4-wheeled vehicle were to pull into the same space.  In the same assessment, if a motorcyclist were directly beside you and attempted to change lanes right into the side of your car, they would be liable for the resulting scratch in the paint or small dent in the door.

Obviously, there's a more overarching issue at stake here, which is that it's best not to threaten each other's lives on the road because of the perceived affront due to having one's travel time lengthened by one or two seconds.  So, the people who drive inches behind a motorcyclist or lunge at them with their car, as if pretending to intentionally ram them, really aren't doing the right thing, even if they had to momentarily slow down or didn't like that someone got in front of them.",t2_7b7im,HungryLikeTheWolf99,0,1648313875.0,0,t1_i27m4zj,i27m4zj,False,HungryLikeTheWolf99,t3_tnonwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/missoula/comments/tnonwm/motorcycles_between_cars_friendly_reminder_about/,Motorcycles between cars??
