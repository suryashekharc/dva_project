"Getting them started was easy. I wrapped the seeds in a paper towel, squirted them with water, put them in a Ziploc bag, and taped the bag to my window with the most light. Out of 10 or so seeds, only 5 or so managed to take hold. From there, when the seeds sprouted roots, I took them into some smallish pots with soil and let them go from there.

 Unfortunately for me, I have dogs and kids, and more pots than safe spots away from the dogs and kids. Only one has survived and it's the one I'm protecting the most because it's the sole survivor.

Caring for it has been relatively simple. I transplant it to a bigger pot whenever the loquat is bigger than the pot. Now, it's in a 3gal pot and will stay there for a while. I will do one more transfer into a 5gal pot and leave it there for some time before putting it in the ground.

Reading up on these, they are fairly drought tolerant when they're adults.

"There's some pretty cool apartment complexes in downtown Riverside.  That's going to be your best bet for a fun active area with lots of young people around.  If you're here for summer, just make sure to live in a place with a pool.  These places are super expensive though, but then again, everything is right now.

Riverside is a great place to live, don't let the haters get to you.  Keep in mind that the city of Riverside is like 90 square miles and has 300,000+ people in it.  You can end up in a lame part of town easily since its so vast.  Downtown is a good bet.  There's plenty of places in Riverside and surrounding areas to hike and bike and you're really close to the mountains.  Hell, I can get off work in Ontario and paraglide up in the mountains for an hour and then meet my wife downtown for a beer or two and dinner on our way home.  It's rad.

Housing idea - furnishedfinder.com , typically a furnished room/rooms to rent from old people in my experience.

"I have to disagree. I can name 10 people I know off the top of my head who own businesses here and do very very well. I’m a government lawyer and these guys put me to shame as far as income they make with businesses right here in the IE. Examples: a plumber with about 10 crews working under him; a guy who remodels the interior of garages and has about 10 employees; another who remodels kitchens and has about 15 employees, another who owns 2 bars, another who runs his own branch of State Farm (sales), another who owns a title company for real estate, another who owns a business alarm company and has his own suite at a stadium. These dudes all make 300-500k easily. Big ass houses in the hills above Rancho or giant spreads in Corona that look like freaking resorts in their backyards. I also know two different guys who sold companies they built here, one for 10M and the other for 16M. I could go on and on (doctors, dentists, manufacturing, etc).

"This is so true. I used to date a girl from New Jersey. She literally lived 10 minutes over a bridge from Manhattan but the people in Manhattan looked down on the Jersey people and called them the “bridge and tunnel crowd.” Because they had to drive on a bridge or in a tunnel to get to Manhattan on the weekends to go to restaurants and clubs. But as an outsider I was thinking I’d way rather live where she grew up. It was beautiful with trees and big houses on big lots, normal nice people and good schools.

"I grew up in Pico Rivera, bordering Montebello and now live in Fontana. Much like Pico and Whittier, Fontana and the IE as a whole have the areas that everyone loves to bash on because it’s not where they’re from or they just don’t like it because of what they’ve heard of it. 

Personally, I’ve grown to love it out here very much. National cemetery, Reign games, Quakes games, 66ers, Auto Club Speedway, Mt. Rubidoux. There’s a lot of cool stuff out here to do or if you want to drive a little further, go out to Yucaipa for some apple picking and a nice day out, go to Whitewater and enjoy the cool water on a warm day. Stop at the dinosaurs in Cabazon, Maybe go up into the mountains in Twin Peaks to check out the Scientology center there. Go up to the Mormon Rocks off the 15 freeway and just hike there. 

Tons of stuff, man. 

I gotta admit, as embarrassing as this is, having grown up in Pico, I never once went to the mansion of governor Pio Pico.

"Imo it's way too expensive for what you get. People move here for the weather mostly. Job prospects are awful in comparison to these prices. If I had to worry about housing prices right now I would be gone in an instant. The weather itself sits a bit on the too hot side. Even winter can get too hot sometimes.

The cities themselves are usually way too spread out so getting around without a car is impossible. Some places have bike lanes and sidewalks at least though which is more than you can say about places like Texas and the Midwest. 

The amount of nature here is below average. You have to do a 30 to 60 minute drive just to see a forest or body of water. Some ie cities have an acceptable amount of greenery in them while others are dry and dull.

So yeah basically the only thing this area has going for it is that its not quite as expensive as oc or la yet. Buts it's getting there.

"The inland empire is sort of a bad place 

( but it’s not oc or la)


Let me explain if you are a poor unskilled worker in oc or la the density allows you to Atleast open your own business as a chef ( see little Saigon , sgv ( Chiense ) , Santana ( Mexican food ) little Arabia ( Anaheim by Disneyland ) Thai town la , Korea town / Buena Park ( oc korea town ) 

The punjabis and Arabs tried to make inland empire their home but the urban sprawl prevented business to develope ethnic enclaves like oc and la has 

If you live in the ie your only option is basically wearhouse work 

Zumiez , Amazon , ect all of its bad i know  because I worked it 

If you become educated sadly most the teaching , engineering , business , medical jobs are located in la/ oc so you will have to drive or move ( eventually ) 

We have universities sure but when comparing UCR  to UCLA or uc Irvine it is obvious the education is underfunded 


Basically if you move you will have to drive all the time and eventually be forced to move as you can’t really put down a community here and your kids will struggle to find work in the sea of track housing 


My friend said it best inland empire is a place. Where people don’t want to put down their roots 

If you get educated or want to start a restaurant and or business people will typically open it in oc and la  as they don’t see them selves retiring here or owning their final home here 

Corona ca is a good example where we have tons of Persians Arabs , Chiense , Vietnamese and desis who are wealthy but just use corona for cheap big houses and own their business in la / oc and will never put down here


Chiense living here drive to Rowland heights 

Vietnamese drive to Westminster 

Persian Irvine / Glendale 

Koreans Buena Park , Irvine , la 

Desi artesia , Irvine

"There's just a lot of issues the more you go towards the desert. That's why it's called the badlands lol. Moreno valley is my hometown and I spent 13 years in corona. Moreno valley is a hub for crime and I'm surprised it was only last year that we had the largest meth bust in US history. I've always said Moreno valley is the best place to find drugs because you have to pass through it to get to OC and LA and HD from San Diego and vice versa, so this part of the IE has a crazy amount of drug related crimes. 

The other reason is that we are HUGE. SB County is the largest singular County in the US being that it stretches almost the entire length of southern California's border to Nevada and Arizona. The IE, I found, contains SB County, so you're looking at the largest piece of sectioned land in the US that has a very diverse ecosystems and areas. 

I remember working in Ontario technically but I was right on rancho Cucamongas border off the 10 and we always got the ghetto from SB spilling over that ""scared"" the rich of rancho despite it being a more expensive place.

"I've lived in Redlands, San Bernardino, Moreno Valley and Riverside.

Redlands is by far the nicest and the place I would recommend to anyone. But it's also the most expensive.

Riverside is also huge and sprawling so it really depends on where you are. I lived near downtown and recommend that area for the most to do/nicest area to spend time in.

Moreno Valley is ok, just nothing special. It's just kind of tired desert suburbia. Redlands and Riverside definitely have more to do and are more pleasant places to hang out/walk around. But Moreno Valley is also the cheapest if budget is an issue.

Moreno Valley and Riverside you'll have to deal with a lot more traffic to Beaumont. The 60 freeway is always a mess and has been under continuous construction for decades. For Redlands you'd use the 10 freeway, which also has traffic (everywhere in So Cal has traffic), but it's not as bad.

All of the above (and anywhere on earth) has good areas and bad areas so you'll want to actually visit (or ask here) before committing to a specific neighborhood.

Don't live in San Bernardino. Literally anywhere is better than San Bernardino.

Yucaipa is racist, don't live there.

I live In Rancho, where most houses go for 800k-4 million now. My neighbors are doctors, lawyers, cops and firefighters. All good solid people. 

The city has won awards as an All-American city with top public schools and low crime. It has Victoria Gardens, every restaurant you could want, a dodgers minor league team, and the famous Thoroughbred Christmas lights. I really like it here.

So the IE is a different place nowadays than the old view suggests. As far as other cities out here, they haven’t all planned as well, but they’re growing.

"Op, idk what your budget is so here’s a breakdown of my interpretation of prices for apartments out here: 
Beaumont, Banning, Yucaipa area is the cheapest ($1,000-$1,500) and far from things to do. 
Moreno Valley and some parts of San Bernardino aren’t too bad (around $1,500) and decent distance from dt Redlands. MoVal also has a small mall. 
Redlands, Riverside, and other parts of San Bernardino are nicer ($1,500-$2,000 and up) with dt Riverside and Redlands being the best social areas you’ll find. 
Can’t say much about air bnb, probably same prices + a few hundred on top. 

***Keep your car locked at night/in parking lots. Ignore shit drivers on the freeway that will gladly run you off the road to save 30 seconds. Do not order out too often unless you have extra spending money. If you like to run/exercise there are nice places to go in Riverside near Mt. Rubidoux. LA is about 1hr 45min-2hr 15min from each city. Check your commute daily with nav apps at least 30 minutes before leaving as roads close due to construction all the time.***

"Avoid San Bernardino, Colton, and Bloomington. Bloomington is just sad. Colton you will probably get carjacked or shot, SB is both. SB makes Detroit look safe.

Rialto is bad too. It's decent area (not ""nice"" but decent) is north of the 210.

"I agree. Rancho is by far the best one he mentioned, but also the most expensive as far as rent. North Fontana is next. Ontario can be ghetto.

"I see you're going to be working in Beaumont.   What's your age?  What are you looking for?  Just work and go home or you looking for entertainment options?   What kind of commute are you looking for? Renting apartment, house?  Single or family? 

&#x200B;

if you're younger, Redlands is probably best.  Close to Beaumont on the I-10 and lots of entertainment options.   A bit pricy but relatively safe.   Next door is Yucaipa, less entertainment, more white power vibes.  Closer to Beaumont than Redlands.   

I don't know much about Calimesa but it looks like a retirement community with some newer homes popping up.   About halfway between Redlands and Beaumont.  

Moreno Valley does not have as many entertainment options as Redlands but probably much cheaper.  You're close to Riverside which has a lot more bars/restaurants.   Like any city, there are areas you should stay away from.   The only issue with Moreno Valley is that there is a section of the 60 Freeway that goes through some hills called the Badlands.   There's always accidents or construction going on there which might detour you an hour or more.  

Cherry Valley is a newer area with absolutely no entertainment options. Lots of newer homes. 

Beaumont itself has a lot of new development.  I'd stay away from the area closer to the freeway.  The Morongo Casino is about 30 minute drive.   Some restaurants but not many bars that I know of.  People like to bash on Beaumont because of what it was but it's slowly changing.

One thing to note is debt to income (DTI) ratio is often the biggest barrier to buying a home, even more so than credit scores especially with how crazy home prices have got now.  So its a good idea to work on your total monthly debt  amounts if your expected exit DTI is over limits.  One trick to help with DTI ratio could be to consolidate any credit debt onto a 0% balance transfer card a couple months before applying for the home loan.

Any other cities within 20 miles that can say all that? 

I also know numerous families in surrounding cities who lie and use Rancho addresses so their little Johnny’s and Janes can attend the award winning schools and play in the award winning youth sports programs (people from Ontario, Fontana, Rosena Ranch etc). 

But I get it. I literally used to make fun of Rancho in the 90s when it was in the middle of nowhere and no one lived here except people who couldn’t afford homes in nice places. But times have changed. Now most can’t afford to live HERE and the interest list for any new homes is off the charts.

He did not return to the SouthFork trailhead parking lot the evening of Saturday, 3/12/2022.  Please help us by spreading the words as we are in hopes that someone might have seen him on SouthFork to San Gorgonio to Dry Lake.  Time is of essence that we locate him due to the harsh freezing temp condition.

The rates for FHA aren't high lol. They are usually 0.5% lower than most conventional. They are 3% lower than DSCR or NonQM. 

You have pmi but you're going to have mortgage insurance on any loan with less than 20% down. Why take time to save up a down payment when the CPI is 7%? You lose the value of the dollar faster than you can save. With a mortgage, the rates are lower than inflation. 

Also yes collectilons stay on the credit report but they don't have a major impact to the score. I have seen people with a 700 FICO 2 years from the date they filed bankruptcy (chapter 7) and had a foreclosure prior to the BK.

"You’ll get there. Just keep working on your credit score. Keep your payments on time and if you can, pay a little bit more whenever possible 

What I did to improve mine was this: I got a small loan with an interest rate of 11%. I used this loan to pay off my credit cards (5 total. 3 credit cards, 1 Lowes card, 1 service card), which, when I added up the interest on all 5 was a whopping 81%. Once I payed them off, my credit score improved and I’ve been chipping away at the loan for a few months now and have kept improving my score. I was able to recently pay an extra $800, so that’s 2 less payments, which isn’t much, but it helps.

"The very first thing I would do is file to get your credit report from all three credit reporting agencies as soon as possible. By law, you can get one report from each one for free. Get your reports and make sure everything there is accurate. Then, look at the areas that are hurting your score. Take care of those first… and keep making on time payments on all the other accounts. If you can knock off a smaller delinquent debt, do that first so that it will drop off your credit report faster. And no matter what… do NOT incur more debt if you are trying to buy a house. Even if you can make payments on time for the new debt, do NOT take on more debt. If you need a car… either pay it cash, or wait until after you buy a house to finance a new car.

You’re right, it's going to take time. It probably took me a few years to get out from my debt and increase my credit score enough to buy a house. Just take it one month at a time Until you get there, and monitor your scores monthly with Credit Karma, or some other free service so you can see your progress.

"Purely looking at politics is short sighted simple-minded thinking.

SoCal gets resources like water from NorCal. SoCal brings in most of the money through major freight and international transportation hubs for trade, tourism, and access to nearby major vacation spots like Hawaii and Vegas. Theme parks, major conventions and sporting events like the Super Bowl and the Olympics bring money to the state. Oh, and billion dollar movies are made here yearly. So let Northern California shoot itself in the foot losing out on all that revenue for extra congressmen that won't make a difference (see Sinema/Manchin)... Yeah no. 

California has the most electorates of all states in the entire country.

"I am getting the sense from your statements that you don't have a clear understanding what the difference is between private and public property is. I may be wrong about that as I am only going by what you are stating in your comments. It's nothing to be ashamed of but if you don't know you can be setting yourself up and they (the governing agencies) can surely take advantage of you if you don't know the difference between what is private property and public property as the laws are different for each. 

Yes, it's true an officer could walk up on your ungated private driveway and ticket your unregistered vehicle although that will not hold up in court in most jurisdictions and will only be thrown out in court once you can prove the vehicle was not on public property, whether parked on the street or driving it on the street. You cannot even drive the car to the DMV to register it. You can go to the DMV and pay a fee for a temporary registration that will allow you to operate the vehicle on the public roadways but you have to do so before that temporary registration expires.

Business properties are a bit tricky. While business property is private property some businesses will not permit you to park an unregistered vehicle on their property and may have an agreement with a towing company that will come tow your vehicle away at the owner's expense even if the owner of the property has given you permission to park the vehicle on their property but don't make it clear to the towing company that a specific vehicle is not to be towed. I've experienced that myself when my employer forgot to notify the tow company to leave my vehicle alone which I was storing there for a month until I got the money to pay up all the back registration of vehicle I had purchased. I had to pay the tow and storage fees, and get a temporary registration just to get the car back which only set back more than I anticipated, but it beat losing the car entirely to a lien.

Like they say in courtrooms nearly everyday to what seems like at least one person if not several, ignorance of the law is no excuse. Telling the judge ""I didn't know that was a law"" is not a viable defense. You will pay for your ignorance. It's your responsibility to know what the laws are. Even courts will take advantage of you if you are not knowledgeable of what the laws are. They will walk right over you without a second thought.",t2_ae0h7cd8,DaUnknowable_Knowin1,0,1645498048.0,0,t1_hxwztd8,hxwztd8,False,max4621,t3_sm86ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/InlandEmpire/comments/sm86ag/can_a_sheriff_come_to_my_home_and_give_me_a/,Can a Sheriff come to my home and give me a ticket for my registration being expired?,/r/InlandEmpire/comments/sm86ag/can_a_sheriff_come_to_my_home_and_give_me_a/hxwztd8/,0,r/InlandEmpire,0,0

"An agency doesn't form laws, write tickets, and collect monies. That would be people that are in some way connected to the agency and benefit somehow financially from it. Of course, there are those in the agencies that do benefit for handing tickets as that is job security in their mind, perhaps advancement if they get good reviews on their work performance. However, those are not even the ones I am alluding to here. I've learned it does no good in sharing the information with those who are not willing to find out for themselves to do their own research as they don't tend to really appreciate it and that is completely understandable. If someone offers me some information and I am receiving it from word of mouth, that is only hearsay for me and I still don't know what they are telling me is true directly for myself. 

For those who interested I recommend they follow the money trail, as it doesn't stop with agents that work for the agency. It goes well beyond that but it is traceable. But you are going to have to do some digging and sifting for that information. You are also going to have to keep an open mind to allowing it to reveal itself to you as it is. If you are truly interested you won't have any problem investigating it and won't put a timetable upon the researching of it, you won't cling to preconceived notions, nor will you form expectations for what the outcome of the truth of the matter might be. Only then will you uncover it. You may be disgusted and angry with what you may find that will have you want to climb to the rooftops with a megaphone and tell everyone what you uncovered. It may make you lose faith in humanity as many do a whole lot of bitching and complaining but they do nothing about it when they have the information. You may begin to fantasizing about taking violent action and I would strongly recommend not ever doing that because in war both sides lose yet those who fund wars always fund both sides but never are they on the battlefield nor are their young adult children. It can lead to all kinds of negative feelings and thoughts that you are going to have to confront in yourself if you are not ready to uncover the corruption which just may blow your mind at how incredibly cold-blooded and can seem to get away with blatant criminal activities that would land you in prison for the rest of your life 5 times over, yet they don't even seem like they can be touched and just deny their involvement and it seems to go away even when there is a huge public backlash. That's what I went through. I learned a lot from it which is why I realized it does no good trying to blow the whistle when people don't really care or are too lazy to do it for themselves. And some people just love to complain but that is as far as it goes for them. They are content with complaining. I'm not judging them for it just saying what I've seen and to me that seems pointless as it does nothing but make you feel like some powerless victim and I am no victim, but I have a great deal of compassion for all of life.

I don't know you so I am not saying this about you directly. But if you're not really interested but only sort of interested or have suspicions you might form ideas in your mind that you don't actually know are true and you may settle for that and may try to convince yourself that what you imagine is the truth is really the truth but it isn't really the truth. You just deceive yourself and then you find yourself trying to convince others that what you think is true is not just a thought but something you actually know when in fact you don't know and it is just a thought. It isn't something we consciously do, it is something we do unconsciously because we don't like what seems to be unjust and corrupt. You may think you want to find out what's at the root of certain things going on with our public systems but you may not prepared to find out the truth. If your mind is already believing it's too big of a task to undertake, it will make excuses as to why you shouldn't waste your time although there is a genuine interest to know and you will just flip flop back and forth and if you do any digging it will be half-hearted and you'll be easily misled by misinformation because there certainly is a lot whole of that going around these days and so you have to do a lot of sifting and that requires a great deal of patience.

In the bigger picture of things, however, it really doesn't matter as everything works out for the good. But it does seem to matter at this level in which we seem to live in a society where people lust for power and it's those who tend to be the most ego-centric that desperately want that power. Corporations routinely put profits over people. Just look at the current administration in the White House. And I honestly don't care if a Dem or Rep gets elected to that office either way. But I can see what a hot mess it is right now and there clearly is a whole lot of corruption in our government that has been going on from day 1 before the nation was even established. Then take a good look at how Congress behaves, making serious criminal allegations against one another and yet the only ones who ever seem to go to jail are the ones hired by the elected officials but never any of the elected officials. The American people get really upset about it but soon something on the news comes along and they forget all about it. They are all caught in some other matter that distracts them. It is what it is, I don't put my hope or hang my happiness in politics and government anyway, but many do and it's no wonder so many people are so incredibly contentious and extremely unhappy. People are at one another's throats it seems like more than ever which is exactly what they want them to be doing thinking their enemy is their fellow countrymen, but look who is influencing them. 

And that right there is a good example of what I was saying, if you are not aware of any of that yourself, you may likely settle for believing me or disbelieving me and that won't do anything for you because you still won't know. Or perhaps you disagree and that is fine too but I am not going to defend any positions. I'll let people believe what they want. When you do know and I know directly for ourselves, there is no desire to debate others about it, as most of them get their information from second hand from a third party, it's not directly know by them. When many others get tired of suffering and can no longer buy into what they are being told because things don't seem to add up they too will do their own digging and they come to know it directly for themselves. Then they will be ready to take action and change is inevitably going to follow. Violence isn't even needed, just knowing the facts and holding them accountable without letting them distract you is enough. But most people are insincere in what they say they care about it and what it is they say they want they don't actually want. They want exactly what they have while saying they don't want it but they don't do anything about changing it so their actions speak louder than their words and prove their words are insincere, they want what they have, a comfortable hell because at least it is familiar. And that's fine, they have what they create whether they are discontent with it or not.

The Fontana Lewis Library and Technology Center is a  really nice building and located right along the Pacific Electric Trail. If you ever need a place to study I recommend there.

The Terra Vista Plaza in Rancho isn't too far. Haven City Market being only two streets south of there- it's a pretty big food court with a huge patio and they have events and live music there.  

Victoria Gardens and Ontario Mills are pretty good sized malls. And Victoria Gardens also has a library attached to it and a nearby park.",t2_bzmvowbc,Temporary_Purchase98,0,1645440247.0,0,t1_hxth810,hxth810,True,Nefarious98,t3_spndsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/InlandEmpire/comments/spndsh/events_in_the_fontana_area/,Events in the Fontana Area,/r/InlandEmpire/comments/spndsh/events_in_the_fontana_area/hxth810/,1,r/InlandEmpire,0,1

At the very least, they could have fixed some potholes.
