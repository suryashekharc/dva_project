"That's interesting, I've worked at both Hamburg and Bluebird for a cumulative 4-5 years (though that ended in 2018) and let's just say, based on seeing behind the scenes, I would eat at Bluebird over the Burg aaaaany day. Bluebird actually makes a lot of their stuff from scratch while Hamburg was getting their corned beef hash from a can. Plus, I never had to apologize to someone who found a penny in their omelette or a macaroni noodle in their coffee at Bluebird (true stories). But no restaurant is above having bad days/meals/staff at times, I'm sorry your experience sucked.

"Coffee: Tru, Daydrink, or The Java House 

Bars: The Webster has great cocktails and food - Think harbinger in a “nicer” space. Pullman, Saint Burch, and Basta all have pretty solid cocktails but most people go for food, you’d probably have luck sitting at their bar, For atmosphere think Orchestrate hospitality restaurants at those three. Tribute eatery and Bar if you’re looking to go to Coralville at all. 

Big Grove brewery is a short 5 minute drive from your hotel. I highly recommend checking it out even if you aren’t into beer.

Joes place is our version of carls. More adult crowd, basic mixers, drafts, and bottles. Solid night cap spot. 

Food: Again, Webster is a chef driven tasting menu type of space. Pullman’s burger is phenomenal. Bastas wood fired pizza is great, I recommend the Lobster Pizza but their crab spaghetti is to die for. Saint Burch has good seafood and steaks, half off oysters during happy hour is always nice. 

Brunch: Pullman, Tribute, Goosetown. bluebird/Hamburg are iowa city staples. 

Iowa River Landing is a nice shopping district in Coralville if you’re looking to sneak away from downtown for a bit. They’ve got solid shopping and a good restaurant scene that  includes Tribute, 30hop, Iowa Athletic Club, Marquee, and Backpocket. 

If you’re watching the final four this weekend, do so at Iowa athletic club! 

Random but George’s, a dive bar near johns grocery is another solid night cap, they cook a cheap cheeseburger out of a pizza oven that is widely known around iowa city. Compare it to fast food and not a sit down otherwise you’ll be disappointed but a few drinks in and it’s everything I could ever want at 1:00am.

"Of course Des Moines has more places, it’s much larger. But Iowa City has incredible gems.

RIP social club though. Did have the best cocktails and whiskey list in town. 

We have a lot of great coffee. Press, Cortado, Sidekick, Day Drink. All are great. I’m a big Press fan personally. They take great care in their coffee and treat their employees well.

Cocktails. Unimpaired is not my thing. The Vue is mediocre and overpriced, but does in fact have a good view. We do not really have a good tiki bar, though there are a couple downtown. I personally do not think there’s any such thing as a place that makes a good aperol spritz. I do like them but just buy some aperol and champagne.

I fucking love cocktails and weirdly the most creative cocktails I’ve had here in the past couple years have been at Tribute (rip 400 rabbits). I have been mimicking the Midnight Cruise at home for several years. Very good. As mentioned, Pullman has both good food and good cocktails. I also like the cocktails at Gene’s. There’s sort of not a lot of great cocktail bars here. We are a college town at heart and students aren’t getting $15 smoked old fashioneds or whatever.

I also absolutely fucking adore the cocktails at Trumpet Blossom. It’s a vegan place, but I think any kind of eater can agree the food and bar are incredible. Get the sazerac if you’re a classic cocktail person. The best. 

Of course, we have every sort of bar you could want. Bars are what Iowa City does well. Just go in any direction. Personally I like Joe’s due reasons I can’t really express. George’s is the oldest bar in town and is great. Deadwood is a great place. Dublin underground has $5.50 Laphroig but is cash only. I’m old so I don’t go to college bars really but a few years ago I went to DC’s and asked the bartender for a wild turkey 101 neat and they gave me a rocks glass filled to the brim. Wild. 

Someone said Formosa for sushi. Absolutely fuck that. The only good sushi in this area is Sushiya in north liberty, and it’s very good. Don’t get any other sushi. 

Brix is a nice wine bar. 

The best restaurant in town without doubt is Rapid Creek, but it’s a bit outside of town. Great views, amazing food. On Wilson’s orchard, which is lovely.

Deluxe is great. Gotta go early because they sell out.

People have opinions about pizza here. I personally like wood fired, traditional, Italian pizza. So my favorite places are Marquee and Maggie’s. I think people who like wig and pen lasagna pizza are on a different planet than me, but that’s a place people do love.

Places with good tap lists have gotten a bit sparse. 30
Hop has gone downhill, but still has a decent list and decent food. Tin Roost also has a decent tap list and probably the best whiskey list in the area which blows because it’s sort of an annoying place. 

We have some good breweries if you like beer. Big Grove of course is great, and their current tap list is particularly spectacular. But ReUnion has really come into their own and makes some great beer, as does Backpocket.

If I were personally going to celebrate my birthday here I would chose from the following generally if you’re fancy:
Rapid Creek
Trumpet Blossom
Pullman
Webster 

If you’re trash like me just get shots and a burger at George’s.

You’re staying on the ped mall, so you are in walking distance from a million things. Gene’s is literally downstairs. Get the New York sour. Be mediocre and walk across to Donnelly’s and get some whiskey and fried pickles. Or walk over to Pullman or the Webster and get fancy. 

Don’t get coffee at high ground though. The owner is a MAGA guy who puts inclusive signs in the windows because he knows it draws business but he hates his customers. Can’t abide that.

"Yoooo I had some decent experiences with Kayla/Rentals by Ivette. They've got relatively reasonable rates. Our situation had a regrettable ending after several years of happily renewing our lease. Our cheap partial sublevel basement unit didn't hold up to the extreme flooding during the '08 event. Given the overall scale of that disaster, it was simply a crappy situation for a lot of people in this area, and our experience was not due to any negligence whatsoever on their part. 

They made every reasonable effort to restore our unit in a timely manner, and were accommodating about refunding the final month's payment w/ our full deposit. They also allowed us to terminate our lease agreement a couple months early w/o penalty when we ultimately decided it was just too much of an inconvenience for us to continue living there with the necessary restoration activities ongoing. Initially it seemed like it could be managed with industrial fans and partial carpeting removal, but then a second flood peak hit and everything just felt overwhelmingly inconvenient after a week+ of recarpeting with industrial ventilation required to dry out the subflooring. We deemed it too depleted in functionality at that point, and they were very understanding when we informed them that we intended to relocate asap. 

I imagine a less ethical rental agency wouldn't have made the effort to reimburse us within just a day or 2 of our termination/reimbursement request. It would've been easy enough to prey on our vulnerability to recoup their own losses; instead, they were very responsive to ensure that we were made financially whole. Being able to drop a new security deposit+rent elsewhere right away was critical to us being able to move forward with our lives with as little burden as possible.",t2_hx8nl,MonsterMashGrrrrr,0,1648657557.0,0,t1_i2qdek9,i2qdek9,False,bigbootyjoody7,t3_trusku,https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/trusku/need_advise_on_renting_in_ic/,Need advise on renting in IC,/r/IowaCity/comments/trusku/need_advise_on_renting_in_ic/i2qdek9/,4,r/IowaCity,0,4

Apartments Downtown, Apartments Near Campus, and several other similarly named agencies exist because it allowed a shitty property management conglomerate to maintain a monopoly stranglehold despite their ongoing issues with terrible PR, legal class action suits, etc. I found that dropping a payment in person every so often helps to humanize yourself and establishes a communicative relationship which may prove helpful over the long term if you need payment extensions, waived late fees, and generally limits the assholery of business practices",t2_hx8nl,MonsterMashGrrrrr,0,1648655428.0,0,t1_i2q844z,i2q844z,False,bigbootyjoody7,t3_trusku,https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/trusku/need_advise_on_renting_in_ic/,Need advise on renting in IC,/r/IowaCity/comments/trusku/need_advise_on_renting_in_ic/i2q844z/,6,r/IowaCity,0,6

"I've lived in an AM Management property on the South East side of town for almost 4 years. I live in one of their newer buildings (I believe the one I live in is 8 years old). I have heard that its a mixed bag in terms of what people feel they are getting from the management when it comes to the maintenance/age of the apartment since they have a variety of offerings. I haven't had any problems. All of my maintenance concerns have been addressed quickly, though there is not maintenance on the weekend unless there is an emergency. I haven't had many maintenance issues, though. It's generally quiet, allows pets, and my buildings shared spaces (hallways/entries) are cleaned and maintained. 

I know they have a lot of places open for fall. Good luck!

"Student legal services and [IA Legal Aid](https://www.iowalegalaid.org/) are great resources to deal with the shifty landlord practices that are all-too commonplace. These organizations know that these ""charges"" are legally suspect (at best). But they've learned that most renters will simply let them keep the money without so much as a peep about the accuracy of their cost assessments. 

At the very least, demand an itemized cost assessment, question anything that seems unreasonable as far as the cost of service or the applicability of any extraneous fees that seem overly punitive. The landlord is responsible for any maintenance costs that can be described as ""reasonable wear and tear;"" it's implied from the fact that a tenant/landlord contract exists! Their rental rates should reflect their costs for facilities maintenance. 

But these goddamn thieves will keep on thieving, so long as they can get away with it 9x out of 10.

"Yes, so long as it's actually in an alley (some of the space behind/between buildings is private property), and doesn't block the alley.  The latter, of course, is problematic--when an alley is too narrow for cars on both sides, you could have parked legally (i.e. not blocking it) but contribute to blocking it based on another car's parking across from you.  Parking enforcement has no way of figuring out who parked to block it.

But commercial vehicles (which includes many rideshares, food delivery drivers, etc.) are allowed to stop in a lane of traffic for up to 15 minutes if there's space at the curb or if there's not a space available within 150 feet. When doing so, the vehicle is required to park, you guessed it, as far right as possible, in order to leave a minimum of 10 feet between the stopped vehicle and the centerline of the road.

"If you're wanting to avoid bike wrecks, you don't want all of those vehicles pulling into and out of blind parking spaces all day.  Remember, those drivers just have a regular license--no special training--and even a good driver isn't going to be perfect in avoiding a cyclist at 15-30+ mph, that could be on the sidewalk, in a bike lane, or in a traffic lane, often without headlights at night, etc.  


With respect to alleys, parking is extremely limited.  Those SYSCO and other larger delivery trucks are effectively prohibited from parking in alleys--city ordinances prohibit parking in alleys except in loading zones (and only then up to the prescribed time limit) if it blocks the alley or if the delivery takes more than 10 minutes.  For many of these vehicles, just getting situated backing into an alley would take as long as the delivery parking in the center turn lane.

Of course, they wouldn't block views of oncoming/crossing traffic and would have curb access for safer maneuvering of their cargo if they could park against the curb, and there were another lane for traffic in the same direction to legally pass.

"I had been preapproved for  a traditional mortage and went back and forth with the seller a couple times. It was a unique situation though, in that 3 adult siblings owned the home they grew up in ( as an LLC) and one wanted way over what it was worth, but the other 2 eventually leaned on him to be more reasonable. They had been renting it but after the management company took a cut, a few hundred a month split 3 ways wasnt satisfying them anymore. They had become too old to manage it themselves and keep up with repairs so instead of letting the management company get fat off them, they decided given their age they would all like some cash in pocket.

First listing they listed it at over 20K over what it was appraised at and last assessed at ($229K as opposed to a more realistic 200K) No bites and it sat on the market for 3 months. This was April of 2021. They came down in chunks, over a period of weeks and when it hit 200K in June finally i jumped on it. I was preapproved and got an inspection report with some haggle points. The house was built in the early 50s and needed some work and had some areas of mild concern but nothing structural or irreversible. Offered 195 got rejected. Finally settled on 200 that they wanted but with an extensive home warranty they will be paying for, for a few years. 

Again to reiterate, no cash offer, and paid asking with some bonus concessions from the seller based on findings in the inspection.

Said home is in Coralville, not Iowa City proper, but anymore Coralville is ballooning faster than older parts of iowa city. 

What really helped is the fact it was 3 parties owning it and 2 were highly motivated to sell ASAP, and only 1 was thinking he was sitting on a goldmine.

Also you’re example is different, you have shelter and choose to deny your dog the shelter versus not having shelter at all.

"Get the inspection. We kind of got boned with the house we're in now- but that's because we were pushed for time and had to get what was available in a very short time. Story time!
2021- we list our house and get an accepted offer same day. We place an offer on a house and it's accepted. Seems good, right? We get an inspection- SO GLAD WE DID. the house needed a brand new breaker box- every breaker was double tapped. Major code violations. Old wiring throughout the house. Firewall between the house and garage not up to code. The breaker box was a giant fire hazard. The price to replace that, new wiring, and to fix the fire wall would've been in the ballpark of over 20k, probably. Most likely more adding in high construction costs at this time and it's not something we would wait on. It was also an estate sale being sold as is and no remedy requests would be honored, it was just for our knowledge. 

We had to find a place or it was living in a hotel with a pet, and finding storage units for our entire house that was packed up. No rentals around here are short term and allow pets. So, we bought in our price range, moved in, and ohmygod it's too small. Three weeks after moving in- we find out we're adding to our family. 10 more weeks to go! We're now fixing our credit that dropped after the checks from buying so we can get another loan, fixing up the as is house we bought so we can sell it again, and hoping with the higher interest rates that some people get out of the buying race.

Advice: get all of your ducks in a row. Get multiple approval letters ready- you don't have to go with all of them. Our first one that was approved ""didn't like"" the lender that we were approved with, and we got one from a local bank. Be picky- it's your home. Make a list of absolutes (what you absolutely need- basements for example), give or takes (appliances can be added later, carpet can be removed), absolutely nots (I personally never want a septic tank again, or propane heating). Remember most things can changed. When you view a house, picture what it can be- ignore carpet, wall color, lighting fixtures can be switched. I also found out that when looking at square footage listed, that only lists FINISHED area. If the basement has 500sq ft of non finished living space (exposed ceiling beams or cement floors for instance), that area is NOT included in the listed size (realtors- correct me if i am wrong here, I'm repeating what I've been told). If you are using a realtor and you find a FSBO home, the seller has to agree to work with your realtor so they get a commission. It's still worth looking at. Zillow has these listings up under ""other listings"". When looking at housing listings, look at the history to see when it was last purchased and the price. It may help determine whether or not it's a flip. You can also look at recently sold and check put the prices listed vs prices sold on realtor.com. 

I'm also looking at your price range 🤣 good luck!

My opinion but it’s not really close. Des Moines can offer you everything. Great job options, growth, schools. But Iowa City can offer that a lot as well.

My realtor also suggested using a local bank for the mortgage, since some people view local as better. 
If you can be flexible with your purchase date, that can help. The owner might want to get out as fast as possible if they found a new home already. Or the owner might also be trying to buy a new home, so they might want to stay a bit longer.

Oh that's fair. You could rent a mini excavator or skid loader. Although landscaping company could be cheaper. Might not hurt to post on some FB groups.

"so, this probably doesn’t count as “recently” since time is accelerating lately but I bought in 2019 just before shit got crazy—while it was pre pandemic and “inflation” and all it was still insane. We’d view a home at noon and by 3pm it would be ‘offer accepted’ at over asking price. 

My wife actually just so happened to be browsing ForSaleByOwner.com and we decided to walk by a listing one day, no sign out front, nothin. It was slightly above our budget but we had our realtor get in touch and they were willing to take slightly below their asking price (foundation issues. and also apparently wildly outdated appliances, all of which we found out afterwards of course).

"I've found the Oakland Cemetery to be good places to start if they're absolutely new at driving because it's empty, very slow, they can stop anytime to calm down, and it's good practice turning corners. The road behind Walmart in Iowa City is also works because it's varies from 25-35. Start with the parking area, then work up to driving up and down Ruppert Rd turning around right before Riverside, and if they're really confident going on Riverside.

Repeat comment about a year ago:

I've had quite a bit of experience helping my wife, colleagues, and au pairs pass their driver's test at East Dale DMV. It doesn't matter how experienced you are with driving because they can very be picky and love to fail you on the spot. You have an equal chance of getting an officer that's extremely strict or fairly easy going so don't feel bad if you have to retake it.

The trick I've found is spending an hour or two driving around the neighbor up to 1/2 mile away (the neighbor pass the railroad bridge and the neighbor by Kirkwood, they like the residential areas). Start from the DMV parking spaces and drive from there just to be familiar with driving out of the plaza because they love to fail you immediately.

Things that failed people... crossing a solid white line like a bike lane when turning from 1st Ave back to the plaza, not pretending the parking exit at East Dale is two lanes and not staying to the right, not being aware you're in a school zone and slowing down (check a map beforehand because sometimes there isn't a School Zone sign but they magically expect you to know), speeding above 25mph / 35 mph, and running a red light (obviously).",t2_3txws,DeskJob,0,1648318599.0,0,t1_i27xcll,i27xcll,True,Significant_Show_130,t3_tooy3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/tooy3g/best_place_to_practice_driving/,Best place to practice driving,/r/IowaCity/comments/tooy3g/best_place_to_practice_driving/i27xcll/,2,r/IowaCity,0,2

"Gosh, lots of quiet roads-- just about every neighborhood.  But more important factor will be time of day. Go out at 7-8am on a weekend and you'll have the town to yourself.

I've driven through [this neighborhood](https://maps.app.goo.gl/joQ7xE1N37z26yuC7) at all times of day and there are hardly ever cars on the road.  Weber Elementary School parking lot is right there, but it's small.  Much larger West High parking lot nearby. 

When your friend is ready for 55-mph roads, head up Hwy 1 north of I-80-- it travels at a good clip (generally most people go 58-60.) but you wont be aggressively tailgaited at long as you're not going below the speed limit.  4mi north of I-80, turn right on Morse Road, also 55mph but usually completely empty. Lots of sweeping curves for them to get a feel for gliding through sustained turns.  If your friend feels insecure and is going too slow,  there are lots of places where another car can pass, it there does happen to be a car behind. Getting passed is a good learning experience, too. (People tend to get all tense when being passed. Don't freak out, it's just no big deal if someone wants to go faster than you. Facilitate the pass by slowing down a little once the other car is in the passing lane, so they can get by as quickly as possible. ) Take  Morse Road to the end, turn right on Baker Ave, and it'll get you down to West Branch.  From there, your friend can get on i-80 if they're ready for interstate, or if not, take the local Herbert Hoover that runs parallel to 80 to get back to IC.  Also a pretty quiet secondary road.  Won't be empty but won't have tailgaters.",t2_3itgburl,KipsBay2181,0,1648304358.0,0,t1_i270nuz,i270nuz,True,Significant_Show_130,t3_tooy3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/tooy3g/best_place_to_practice_driving/,Best place to practice driving,/r/IowaCity/comments/tooy3g/best_place_to_practice_driving/i270nuz/,3,r/IowaCity,0,3

Hand form about 1/4 lb of 85% (add whatever spices you like, I add salt/pepper, onion powder and a bit of garlic powder). Take two sheets of parchment paper and smash and smooth that sucker until it's about idk, 2cm thick. It should end up about the size of your hand. Preheat a smooth griddle, I use a theROCK non-stick, on your stovetop or grill. If you like onion cut a few slices, you'll throw your burger and your onions on the preheated griddle. Let cook maybe 3-4 minutes without touching it then flip it, add your cooked onions atop the patty and anoint with the cheese of your choice. Slap down a buttered bun to toast that baby up, remove your patties from the griddle arrange whatever condiments you choose on your toasty buns (spicy mayo ftw).

"Szechuan House, 320 E. Burlington St., Iowa City – During a March 4 visit, an inspector cited the establishment for 17 serious risk-factor violations and noted there was no certified food protection manager on staff and that the person in charge at the restaurant was unable to answer questions related to proper cooking and holding temperatures, handwashing and sanitizing.
Employees were observed working with raw meat and then, without washing their hands, proceeding to work on other tasks. Employees were eating in the kitchen; there was mold “on multiple heads of cauliflower” inside the walk-in cooler, and raw meat was stored in multiple locations above ready-to-eat foods.
Also, fried duck and spring rolls were sitting in a fryer basket at 95 degrees and had to be discarded; sprouts, cracked eggs, house-made soups, cooked chicken and other high-risk foods were not being held at cold enough temperatures to ensure safety; racks of ribs and pork belly were discovered hanging from hooks inside the “mechanical room” of the business; raw shell eggs were stored on a cart at 74 degrees and had to be discarded; and none of the food products in the coolers were marked with a date, with the person in charge indicating they were cooked “a number of days ago.”
Also, the dishwashing machine was not able to produce water at an adequately hot temperature; numerous “clean” knives, peelers, and slicers were that were stored throughout the kitchen had excessive food buildup on them; the meat grinder had debris inside it, even after cleaning; one handwashing sink was being used to rinse knives used for raw meats and vegetables, and another handwashing sink had a bag of items and a strainer sitting in the basin.
The inspector also reported that beef was being thawed at room temperature in a tray that sat atop a garbage can; there were no thin-tipped thermometers available for checking food temperature, and there were multiple “sticky traps” used for pest control seen throughout the kitchen.
Also, food items were stored on the floor in the dry goods storage area; there was no chlorine sanitizing solution set up at the time of the  inspection; multiple knives were stored in crevices between the coolers and the walls, with one knife wedged between a drain line and the wall; one cooler that was set at its coldest possible temperature was unable to cool below 48 degrees;  and multiple cutting boards had excessive scoring and staining, making cleaning impossible.
Random items unrelated to the restaurant business, including the trunk door to an Audi automobile, were stored in the server area and dry goods room; there was a buildup of food debris on the floor and walls; multiple missing ceiling tiles had been replaced with cardboard; and the establishment’s most recent inspection report was not posted.",t2_e1lf6c7,PaladinQuixote,0,1648070478.0,0,t1_i1ukqev,i1ukqev,False,Slight-Marketing-637,t3_tl4g3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/IowaCity/comments/tl4g3b/since_china_wok_is_closing_in_iowa_city_what_are/,Since china wok is closing in Iowa city.

A Phase you might hear or see a lot on this or Iowa subreddits is ""Fuck Mediacom"" While I agree, they have in the past had a Internet and Phone Package. They might be worth looking in to.
