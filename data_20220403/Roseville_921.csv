"Roseville is not getting worse and worse lol it's getting better and better. If anything there was way more gang issues in the 90s and 2000s near Denios and off Riverside, now that issues non existent.

"I hate it. Everything west of fiddyment road and north of Blue oaks is just overkill. They have ruined West Roseville and that entire area. It's horrible now. No resemblance of the area it was even in the 90s or 2000s.

"I hear you. Down payment is only 1 thing lenders look at. The others are your credit score and gross monthly income. For example, someone may be bringing in $7000 a month gross income, but they have high spending habits or live in a high rent area, therefore it’s tough to save for a down payment. However, that $7000 monthly gross income could qualify someone for a $400k mortgage easily. I know the city of Roseville offers down payment assistance to qualified buyers with stipulations. And some lenders offer a 0% down mortgage.

I know it may seem like a lot of money, but you kind of suck it up for a few years. After that, explore refi options to eliminate some of the outgoing cash every month (PMi/MIPS) and before you know it, you’re in a good place with equity and monthly cash flow. 

My wife and I were flat broke, put $8k down on a dump of a place on a $200k home with a $12k month payment and could barely afford anything else. We slowly started putting money into the house to fix it up, buying things when they were on sale or when credit cards offered 0% interest for x number of months. 

Sold that house for $350k after 5 years and took the profit and bought a $500k place and we’re doing the same process again. Also, over the last 8 years we have increased of gross income to help with the larger monthly mortgage. 

There are options out there for some people if they’re willing to take the leap and put themselves in a good long term financial situation.",t2_a15p5rfl,tattooed_underdog,0,1648928434.0,0,t1_i355ia1,i355ia1,False,degrassidance,t3_tjnbxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/tjnbxh/adora_townhomes/,Adora Townhomes,/r/Roseville/comments/tjnbxh/adora_townhomes/i355ia1/,1,r/Roseville,0,1

"As an amateur photographer myself, this is/will be an interesting case. 
My understanding of the press, especially in this day and age, is that they often use sensationalism to attract views/clicks.    In this case the vagueness of the reporting makes it seem as though maybe this is blown out of proportion and the man tried to assert his right to film/photograph in a public setting and the officers needed/wanted to find out(for the sake of those around) who he was and what he was actually doing. 
I try myself to make sure that I point my camera down if children (especially teens) are in my line of sight. 
But again, photography is not a crime in a public setting. 
I understand the parents being concerned. I would be also. 
But I wonder if any of them asked him to delete any pictures of their kids(if ANYONE asks to delete ANY shot, I comply)

I will say that the part about contacting and ""molesting"" should be taken seriously. But with the police/news reporter being ""less than forthcoming"" their selves, I wonder if he just tried to assert his fifth amendment  rights to the officers and they escalated(the article listed the ""resisting"" first)

If you’re looking to stay in Roseville then Miner’s Ravine trail is your best bet. There are some decent climbs for runners. False Ravine splits off Miner’s Ravine and is ~ 1.5 miles uphill. Or you can run up Sierra College from the end of the trail there. There’s also some dirt paths that go uphill toward houses by the Sierra College end. I believe Miner’s Ravine is about 8 miles from one end to the other. You can extend that to 10 miles if you include the Sierra College Blvd to False Ravine Loop.,t2_ax6ad,w11,0,1647786007.0,0,t1_i1em8bz,i1em8bz,True,scruple,t3_tia3n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/tia3n9/a_question_for_rosevilles_runners/,A question for Roseville's runners,/r/Roseville/comments/tia3n9/a_question_for_rosevilles_runners/i1em8bz/,3,r/Roseville,0,3

"People drive similar speeds inside and outside of Roseville, but Roseville has lower speed limits, for the same roads.  This doesn't affect how fast people drive, but it does affect the revenue from speeding tickets.  A decade or so ago, Roseville lowered the speed limits and switched to issuing a different kind of speeding citation that sends most of the money to the local government, which the gave out more aggressively.

It hurt their relationship with other government organizations, which were throwing out Roseville's citations on appeal. and Roseville eventually went back to normal citations given out at normal rates, but the low speed limits stuck around.  It's still a little easier to get citations thrown out, because in California, for speed limits greater than 25 MPH and lower than 55 MPH, the burden of proof is not that the driver was going faster than the posted speed limit, but that going that speed is unsafe, and when the speed limits don't follow convention that is more difficult to prove.",t2_az9fk,Who_GNU,0,1647414873.0,0,t1_i0uvkq8,i0uvkq8,True,whey_to_go,t3_tf6q1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/tf6q1q/why_does_everybody_drive_so_fast_here/,Why does everybody drive so fast here?,/r/Roseville/comments/tf6q1q/why_does_everybody_drive_so_fast_here/i0uvkq8/,17,r/Roseville,0,17

"It's a bit late for citrus, so you'll mostly just see sumo oranges and kumquats, as well as regular oranges which more or less store year round, but only taste good in season.

Denio's will have them all.  (Although kumquats aren't common there.)  The best fruit there is cherimoya, usually from San Luis Obispo, which is entering its season, but is on the pricier side, rarely reaching a low of $5/lb.

There's not much other fruit in season this time of year, because most everything is budding, so you only get fruit from trees that ripen super late.  I recommend checking Denio's in a few months, when you should start seeing a lot of interesting fruit from the area.  Until then, you can get some imported fruit their, which may still be interesting but won't taste its best.",t2_az9fk,Who_GNU,0,1646813419.0,0,t1_hzy6pjr,hzy6pjr,True,BrotherBringTheSun,t3_t9ztao,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t9ztao/where_is_the_best_selection_of_unique_fruits/,Where is the best selection of unique fruits?,/r/Roseville/comments/t9ztao/where_is_the_best_selection_of_unique_fruits/hzy6pjr/,5,r/Roseville,0,5

"One thing to keep in mind is that Roseville is the most wannabe So-cal city in Nor-Cal.  White bread mainstream, in my gothy-punky wife's words.

Prevues in Sac might be worth the drive, and Evangeline's costume shop MIGHT be open by appointment, dunno if they're doing that again since I'm pretty sure they stopped for COVID.  If you know what you want specifically, they try not to turn down the sale, but I'm sure they try to limit the folks up there.  It's a zoo around Halloween when they have it open normally.

Solstice in Nevada City might be worth planning a day trip to the gold country for, stop by Yabobo and Asylum Down as well while you're up there, too, my wife likes looking for accessories there.

Just prior to 12:26 p.m. today 10 suspects entered a jewelry store within the mall at 1151 Galleria Blvd. 
While brandishing a firearm, the suspects used sledge hammers to smash several jewelry cases. The suspects fled the area with an unknown amount of jewelry.   
The suspects are described as 16-22 year old, possible black male adults, wearing hoodies.   
This remains an active investigation. Anyone with information about the incident is encouraged to call the Roseville Police Department at 916-774-5000.

"A large Roseville restaurant space that's housed several eateries over the past few years is empty once again.

Fahrenheit 250 BBQ has permanently closed its restaurant at 390 N. Sunrise Ave. in Roseville, according to a voicemail message at its phone number.

The locally owned barbecue restaurant, known for menu items such as ribs and pulled pork, opened the Roseville site in early 2020. It was a relocation for the eatery, which was previously located near California State University Sacramento. With the move, the restaurant grew from 4,600 square feet to more than 8,400 square feet.

Operators of Fahrenheit 250 did not immediately respond to an email seeking additional details about the closure.

Fahrenheit 250 had 3 1/2 stars on Yelp, based on more than 240 reviews.

The two-story restaurant space in Roseville, which was built as Mision Rogelio, has housed several short-lived eateries in recent years.

Before it became Fahrenheit 250, the space was occupied by Ciao Pizza, which closed after a few months of business, amid a legal dispute between its operators.

Prior to housing Ciao Pizza, the space operated as Ettore’s Bakery & Cafe, which closed after about 10 months.

And before Ciao Pizza, it was ASR Restaurant & Lounge, a high-end eatery that shut down after about two years.",t2_80g1a,gamefaqs_god,0,1646344269.0,0,t1_hz8kesq,hz8kesq,True,gamefaqs_god,t3_t62nte,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t62nte/fahrenheit_250_bbq_permanently_closes_in_roseville/,Fahrenheit 250 BBQ permanently closes in Roseville,/r/Roseville/comments/t62nte/fahrenheit_250_bbq_permanently_closes_in_roseville/hz8kesq/,16,r/Roseville,0,16

"A Marin County-based bicycle shop is growing its presence in the greater Sacramento area following its acquisition of Roseville Cyclery on Vernon Street in downtown Roseville.

The acquisition was announced on Tuesday in a YouTube video. Helen Dyda, a public information officer with Roseville, said the city's economic development department was notified that Roseville Cyclery was being purchased by Mike's Bikes.

The bicycle shop will now be called Mike's Bikes of Roseville.

Mike's Bikes was founded in 1964 and has since expanded to 12 locations throughout the Bay Area and Sacramento, including locations on Gold Lake Drive in Folsom and I Street in Sacramento, according to its website.

Last August, Bicycle Retailer & Industry News reported that Netherlands-based Pon purchased Mike's Bikes, though the Marin County-based company was expected to remain independently run from other Pon companies. Pon's portfolio includes more than 15 bike brands, including Gazelle, Santa Cruz, and Schwinn, according to its website.

Representatives of Mike's Bikes could not be reached for comment on Tuesday.

In Tuesday's announcement, Roseville Cyclery founder and owner Oliver Bell said he bought his first mountain bike in 1987 at a Mike's Bikes location and worked for the company at one point.

""When the opportunity presented itself to become part of the MIke's Bikes team, I didn't blink an eye and we move forward,"" he said. ""This is something that's meant to be.""

Bell said the transition will provide his employees with a better benefits package and opportunity for upward mobility in the larger Mike's Bikes company. It will also provide a deeper inventory for store customers, he said.

He is expected to remain on staff in a leadership role.

Oliver and Yi Bell opened Roseville Cyclery in 2013. The business serviced and sold bicycles, including electric bikes, bike components, accessories and clothing, according to its website.

The shop is located at 404 Vernon St. in downtown Roseville. Last November, Oliver Bell filed plans to improve a vacant space at 105 Lincoln St. in downtown Roseville. Plans called for the remodel of the more than 3,000-square-foot space into a bike store. It's unclear if that project is ongoing or included in the deal with Mike's Bike's. Oliver Bell did not respond to a request for comment, and Mike's Bikes representatives couldn't immediately be reached by the Business Journal.",t2_80g1a,gamefaqs_god,0,1646259338.0,0,t1_hz3v785,hz3v785,True,gamefaqs_god,t3_t5boi1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t5boi1/mikes_bikes_expands_presence_in_area_after_taking/,Mike's Bikes expands presence in area after taking over Roseville Cyclery,/r/Roseville/comments/t5boi1/mikes_bikes_expands_presence_in_area_after_taking/hz3v785/,3,r/Roseville,0,3
"A new housing project is planned for the former site of a courthouse in downtown Roseville.

Though the city still owns the site, Bridge Housing in San Francisco has filed an application to build a five-story, 69-unit affordable housing project for seniors at 505 Royer St. Bridge Housing didn't return a call for comment Tuesday, but city spokesman Brian Jacobson said in an email that city officials and Bridge are discussing a purchase-and-sale agreement for the property.

According to the application, Royer Street Apartments would be mostly studios and one-bedroom units, ranging from 469 to 675 square feet. There would also be one two-bedroom unit of 896 square feet on the top floor. In addition to the apartments, the property would have a 933-square-foot office and a 1,328 square-foot community room. There would also be 61 parking spaces. Royer Street Apartments' community room would open onto a courtyard with a covered patio.

LPAS is the project architect.

The application doesn't lay out the income levels for the apartments.

Bridge Housing has done a handful of local affordable projects, including Rivermark in West Sacramento, but doesn't appear to have carried out one in Roseville before.

Until about a year ago, the 1.17-acre site 505 Royer St. had a courthouse building on it dating to 1969 but unused for several years. Roseville acquired it from Placer County in 2013 for $540,000 and considered making it available for other uses, such as coworking, but dropped those plans when the cost of renovations to bring it up to code was too high.

In late 2020, the city issued a request for proposals for the property itself, with plans already in motion to demolish the building. The site was one of several city officials have identified as key to giving Roseville's downtown a stronger identity, along with others along Vernon Street near City Hall.",t2_80g1a,gamefaqs_god,0,1646259243.0,0,t1_hz3uz7u,hz3uz7u,True,gamefaqs_god,t3_t5bnex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t5bnex/senior_apartments_planned_for_former_downtown/,Senior apartments planned for former downtown Roseville courthouse site,/r/Roseville/comments/t5bnex/senior_apartments_planned_for_former_downtown/hz3uz7u/,7,r/Roseville,0,7

"An industrial developer hasn't done a lot with empty land in Roseville since selling a piece to the FBI more than a half-decade ago – but that's about to change.

Schnitzer Properties is working with city planning and cost estimators for what would be a four-building project of more than 300,000 square feet, called the Blue Oaks Commerce Center.

""We knew we had a good location, and we knew development would be moving toward us,"" said Schnitzer senior vice president and regional manager John Shorey of the 25-acre project site, south of Blue Oaks Boulevard between Industrial Avenue and Washington Boulevard. ""The time is right.""

Shorey said all four buildings will be built on spec, with two smaller ones closer to Blue Oaks and two larger ones to the south. The smaller buildings would probably be aimed at engineering firms or back-office users, with options to add small offices, he said.

Companies in e-commerce or distribution would be the more likely tenants for the other two buildings, the larger of which would be more than 100,000 square feet, Shorey said.

Shorey said Portland, Oregon-based Schnitzer, known until recently as Harsch Investment Properties, plans to start construction as soon as this fall, and have buildings ready by late spring or early summer of next year. While costs are still being determined, he said, company managers have already noticed they've risen 20% to 25% from a couple of years ago when the project was first being considered, and likely will rise further before work starts.

Most of the local building activity has focused on larger distribution centers of 500,000 square feet or more. But that provides an opening for Schnitzer to meet its niche: Buildings with several tenants who may eventually springboard into larger space elsewhere.

""The smaller ones are so intensive, you have to build little offices, you have to manage them,"" Shorey said, explaining why many companies build larger.

Even so, he said, he wouldn't be surprised if Blue Oaks Commerce Center is 20% to 25% leased before it's complete, given how hot the industrial market is.",t2_80g1a,gamefaqs_god,0,1646176308.0,0,t1_hyz5i1t,hyz5i1t,True,gamefaqs_god,t3_t4l591,https://www.reddit.com/r/Roseville/comments/t4l591/schnitzer_properties_plans_more_than_300000/,"Schnitzer Properties plans more than 300,000 square feet of industrial buildings in Roseville",/r/Roseville/comments/t4l591/schnitzer_properties_plans_more_than_300000/hyz5i1t/,5,r/Roseville,0,5
"A vacant space adjacent to Eureka! in Roseville is being taken over by a higher-end taqueria concept based out of Mexico City, which is expected to open later this year.

Eureka! opened in Roseville's Highland Village center in November 2019. The Southern California-based eatery serves American cuisine, with options such as burgers, sandwiches and salads. It also has a bar that serves a variety of cocktails, whiskeys and local craft beers.

Shortly after the Roseville opening, a Mexico City hospitality company called Grupo Carolo invested into the Eureka! Restaurant Group with a plan to take its taqueria concept called La Popular and adapt it to the United States market.

Paul Frederick, founder and chief development officer of Eureka! Restaurant Group, said the first U.S. La Popular location is planned for the Roseville site.

The full-service restaurant will occupy an approximately 3,700-square-foot space adjacent to Eureka! at 234 Gibson Drive in Roseville. The location also features an approximately 1,200-square-foot patio area.

Frederick said the taqueria will have about 25 to 30 menu items and its meats will be slow-cooked al pastor, meaning roasted on a vertical skewer or spit.

Some of the menu items include rib eye tacos, veal Milanese, cheese-crusted quesadillas and churros. The restaurant's bar will also serve about 40 different mezcals and tequilas, as well as Mexican beers, he said.

Roseville was selected as the first U.S. location for the Mexico City taqueria because it is a top three location in Eureka!'s portfolio, Frederick said.

""Our strategy for La Popular is to take it into our Eureka! markets where we already exist and have found success, which will provide way better economies of scale by having multiple brands in a particular region,"" Frederick said.

He said having the two locations open next to each other will result in delivery efficiencies and be a better use of the restaurant group's supply chain.

La Popular is expected to open in Roseville this August and will employ between 55 and 60 people, Frederick said.

He said the restaurant group also plans to open a La Popular in Austin, Texas about three months after the Roseville location.

The Highland Village center is located near the Westfield Galleria at Roseville at the intersection of Gibson Drive and Roseville Parkway.
