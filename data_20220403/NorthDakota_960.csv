"This is why I think in the current political climate, appealing to 'social conservatism' by any party on the left is kind of impossible and they really just shouldn't do it. The R party platform is not based on any kind of material reality that they want to protect, and it is pretty clear at this point that people who vote exclusively on the social conservatism are not going to be swayed.

This is why I think the NPL from the first half of the 20th century is a good model looking forward. They are mostly known for tackling real problems people faced, creating state institutions to make life better for everyone (i.e. rural schools, a state bank and state mills to help small farmers and businesses, anti-corporate farming legislation, etc.) I truly still believe that if you can do stuff like this, you will get votes.

The same thing holds true with Wi-Fi/Internet plans, buy a decent package and not the cheapest option because they will be the same especially with streaming becoming bigger and bigger. Having some extra bandwidth to support additional devices is always a nice thing.

"Presuming America survives, it will take care of itself. As prices rise in urban areas, it will push people farther and farther into rural areas. I suspect these people will have less fear of change and differences as your average North Dakotan, so probably more likely to lean to the Democrat side. 50k extra Democrats in the state could dramatically change the look of our politics. 

Also, I think the recent D resurgence of labor rights and unionization could help push things in the D direction. I don't think many ND Democrats don't really want AOC-style politics, but can really get behind the old school D notion of living wages and blue dog D sort of policy.

"Historically, progressive politics were strongest in North Dakota when they were couched explicitly in being non-partisan and local. Hence, the [Nonpartisan League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonpartisan_League). Things like the Bank of North Dakota that were established by the NPL are still widely popular in the state (and outside of the state) today. Even though the NPL still technically exists as part of the Dem-NPL, they are a far cry from what they were in the early 1900s. That said, ND is not an exclusively Republican stronghold, we had a Democrat senator just a few years ago.

Personally, I think the best way to go about it would be to take lessons from the success of the NPL. The hardest part then would be funding - the broader Democrat establishment would not be interested in funding candidates who aren't running on the party line especially in a state like ND, and Republicans would be able to access their party funding as easy as ever. There are also monied interests from things like oil companies which would make it difficult.

"Would you say the same if this were about Republicans?  (And don't scoff, because truth is stranger than fiction; though it wouldn't be any time soon.  Not too long ago, all our members of Congress were Dems.)

We *already* have only one party (since both parties represent the wealthy and corporations); we need at least 10 more parties to actually represent the views of everyone in the country.  That is, if you want a healthy democracy.  (If you disagree, debate me, don't just downvote.)

You are falling for what they want.  They want you hating Dems (and vice versa), because if Dems are your enemy you won't talk to them.

"And I feel that is a different discussion. My point has nothing to do with race and everything to do with human accountability. Opportunities upon opportunities to get the grades and attendance and all just squandered. Parents calling to get grades boosted for their kids who just cut class and being told to boost the grades by the higher ups. I hope to warn any teacher trying to get a job in New Town. Unless you plan on staying here forever, I would suggest not trying to come here. It’s very corrupt for many reasons. If New Town is where you want to plant your roots, then absolutely you may like it and be more understanding to the lifestyle here. The school isn’t doing favours to these kids by giving them countless mulligans. They are just encouraging bad behaviour. Then when it’s time to leave high school, the students think that’s life. Out of the people who leave town, many come back to New Town as they get a hard dose of reality what it’s like outside of this 1,800 population town and realize the world isn’t holding their hand or handing out endless chances. Some stay, get jobs locally, and no show for work, or show up when they feel like, and wonder why they are fired.  Now don’t you think that maybe the accountability should start while these people are in school? 

Anyway I’m not going to change New Town.

"I think the first part of your statement is somewhat correct. But.. just because your Ojibwa and from a reservation doesn’t give you an out for ‘anything else being thrown at you’ and it certainly doesn’t mean you know what family life is for any of the kids there, you just think you do, which somehow gives you the right to speak on it like fact? I was taught respect is earned at a young age, if the teachers aren’t getting the respect *you think* they deserve,  (which you would have to somehow know how every single teacher gets treated by every student and vice versa to know that) maybe there’s a reason.

"This is one of the largest fleecings going on right now. With the amount of money they need from taxpayers and from not having to pay taxes on what they do, they could build wind with storage and put out nearly as much energy, without any of the long-term funding. Remember this is only to get it up and running. Long term they will need funding to keep it running. And it's still not exactly clean. It still produces quite a bit of uncaptured co2, and the capturing itself requires energy.

At the end of the day it's keeping jobs in these areas and that's it. Everything else is negative about it in the long term.  The alternatives to this are a much better investment. Hence why those are happening without government funding now.

When he sold Great Plains to Microsoft back in 2001, they received 1.1 billion in Microsoft stock in a swap. In 2001, Microsoft stock was like $45. Today it is is over $300 a share.

Of course Burgum didn't own all of Great Plains, but somewhere around 25%. Not sure on the math or what it was per share, but that's like 25 million shares of Microsoft. If Burgum got 25% of that, it's 6 million shares and he would have been worth 1/4 billion 20+ years ago. Today, 6 million shares of Microsoft stock is worth 1.8 billion. Just the dividends alone on that is nuts.

But its not like he didn't do anything after that... he was a Senior Vice President at Microsoft for almost 7 years. Arthur Ventues who put money into numerous companies that were sold to multi national corporations and they are an investors in other companies like Avalara.

I will say on this sub alot of people are assuming that there is a shared cultural connection. Theres not. Many of the ancestors from bessarabia and the black sea region where isolated from the local populations. Many didnt speak the same language or interact alot. Lots of those Germans kept to their own villages with emphasis on staying in close communities. Many Ukrainians hated the German population at the time and supported the removal of rights from german citizens. Even during the revolution many part took in pillaging and slaughter of what few germans remained. Thats what happened to my ancestors village and my great grandfathers entire family.,t2_enb0mfqx,Big_Bad_Johnn,0,1648633878.0,0,t1_i2p2cyf,i2p2cyf,True,SalamanderMoney1105,t3_t1b4b5,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/t1b4b5/ukrainian_connection/,Ukrainian Connection,/r/northdakota/comments/t1b4b5/ukrainian_connection/i2p2cyf/,0,r/northdakota,0,0

"The real reason for leaving was restrictions on rights. As resources dwindled in the black sea region and more families had kids the russian government of the time started restrictions such as a ban of the german language, ban on Lutheranism, ban on how much land one can keep, and general discrimination from local Ukrainians. Drafting wasnt a big part until the end just before the revolution.

"I'm not intimately knowledgeable about the geography and climate of New Zealand, but I assume it's quite mountainous and that you're no stranger to some snow and cold. The first thing everyone here fearmongers about first is the winter deep freeze. Presumably some mountain peaks can get colder than it does here, but I will note that a blizzard on the open, unmasked plains is its own special kind of hell if you're not prepared. It's not like that all the time here, no, but I'd hate to promise you a good time only for you to come through at a time when mother nature decides to thrash us with those bitter wintry winds.

That aside, though, North Dakota might as well be the polar opposite of New Zealand. You're literally as far away from salt water as you can possibly get on this hemisphere of the planet. Everything is flat and open, and relatively treeless in all directions. Most of the only things to see are the long, lonely roads that meander across the occasional rolling hills. It really isn't much. But I will say there's a kind of zen to it that I like, and if you're into the idea of seeing something so distinctly opposite to what you might be used to, you might get some value out of it. I've heard people who were born and raised sheltered by trees, mountains, and/or tall buildings their entire lives, then when they come here they say the sheer emptiness is intimidating.

If you make it here at the correct time, usually around Dec/Jan, you might be able to witness one of the more exceptionally pretty sights of North Dakota in winter. Occasionally we will get a foggy winter evening that will cause a thick layer of white frost to deposit on trees during the night freeze. When you wake up in the morning, you wake up to [this wintry dreamland](https://www.onlyinyourstate.com/north-dakota/snow-scenery-nd/). [Sun dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog) are also another one of those things I'd consider one of our best-kept winter secrets. North Dakota certainly isn't the only place where these things happen, of course, but both happen quite consistently.

As for specific activities to see and do, I don't really know what to say that hasn't already been said. Hunting, fishing, snow sports (as long as they don't involve slopes, lol). Nothing you can't find elsewhere, but we do have some of it too. Personally, though, I'd say that if activities are your thing you'd be better off visiting in the summer, not the winter. One of the jokes here is that, come winter, the only thing to do is drink. And we do. A lot. If nothing else, if you like to socially drink, stop by any random small bar and try to strike up some conversation. The people here are generally really friendly.

I find North Dakota to be a really hard sell, honestly. You really just have to be able to click with the relative emptiness, plainness, and the extreme climate swings to make the most of it out here. If those aren't positives to you, there probably isn't much for you here.

"I live in Fargo, ND.  My family is from New Mexico, and I used to go camping and hiking there all of the time.

When the natives are telling you, that a road trip in the winter is dangerous.  They ain't kidding.

Now, when I moved to North Dakota, no one joked about me seeing snow for the first time.  I think that's a cultural issue.  Because you may have experience that we don't know about and North Dakotans wouldn't want to embarrass anyone, I think.  I just have to add...

"First, and this is so stupid, the constitution gives you the right to vote, not either part. The hilarious part of this is that voter ID has become this political issue, because it's ""racist"" to require IDs to vote. But nowhere else is this idea that requiring ID for things seen as racist. (Oh, god forbid, maybe in some weird niche scenario I've never heard of, by and large, requiring ID is a sensible requirement for MANY, MANY different things. But it's racist to require it for voting. Ok.)

So, how did that whole idea get started? Investigate the origins of that narrative, and shockingly, it's because Democrats realized that this is an issue where they stand to garner a large number of votes. (And of course, verbally whip their republican counterpats. ) If you think they're being altruistic here, or promoting the idea out of some civic responsibility, you're sadly naive.

"What has changed?

I think that's the big question. I'm not sure there is any one good answer. 

Some of it is a long term trend toward cultural balkanization. Liberals control our society's most important cultural institutions - entertainment, academia, the news media, even corporate America increasingly - and that's made conservatives feel marginalized. 

Some of it is what we just went through. We havent yet come to terms with the profound cultural impact of the pandemic yet.

Some of it is a political shift. The Reagan-era coalition of social conservatives, chamber of commerce types, and anti-communists has fallen apart and in its place has risen a new sort of populist nationalism driven in no small part by the demise if blue collar jobs (manufacturing, etc) thanks to globalization.

"Port: Becker backers may attempt an arcane rule change at NDGOP convention to circumvent the June ballot

In true Trumpian form, U.S. Senate candidate Rick Becker's followers seemingly think they can ignore election law when it doesn't produce the results they want.

MINOT, N.D. — Hold on to your hats, folks, because this is going to be a wild ride through the byzantine rules of party conventions and our state's candidate selection process, but you need to pay attention.

There is an effort afoot to circumvent North Dakota's election laws that is not at all unlike disgraced former President Donald Trump's conspiracy-addled and legally dubious efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

In our state, the primaries for the political parties, the contests which determine the candidates that will represent the parties on the November ballot, happen in June.

What, then, is the point of the endorsing conventions the political parties hold each cycle in late March and early April? The candidates selected at those events are automatically placed on the June ballot for their party's nomination.

All other candidates seeking that nomination must collect signatures to make the June ballot. This means that candidates who lose the convention endorsement can still run for and receive the nomination from voters in June.

Gov. Doug Burgum did just that in 2016.

Sen. Kevin Cramer followed that same path in 2012.

But there is an effort afoot to ignore North Dakota's long-standing laws, to ignore the decision of statewide voters on the June ballot, and recognize whoever wins at the NDGOP state convention this weekend as the nominee for the November ballot.

Last night there was a meeting of the Minot-area NDGOP delegates, and I got some reports from the people in attendance. ""Jared Hendrix appears to be presenting/advocating this idea that delegates should amend the convention rules to directly nominate candidates, instead of endorse,"" one surprised Minot-area Republican told me.

This has been on my radar for a while.

Hendrix, in addition to being a consultant for Rick Becker's U.S. Senate campaign and the chairman of the term limits measure committee which is facing a criminal investigation over its signature collection practices , is also the chairman of District 38 Republicans in the Minot area.

What he's arguing is that the delegates at the convention can change the party's rules and, ignoring both the June primary vote and state law, nominate candidates for November.

His motivations are as crass and self-serving as they are transparent.

Hendrix and Becker have been manipulating the delegate selection process at the district level for months, to the point where Becker's chances of beating incumbent Sen. John Hoeven at the convention are a coin flip. But Becker isn't very popular outside of his very energetic faction of Trumpy supporters, and few see a path to victory for him on the June ballot where Hoeven, if Becker stays in the race past the convention, is expected to wallop him in a landslide.

Hoeven's advantage in June won't matter, though, if the convention nominates instead of merely endorsing.

What do we think of this?

For one, this is an odd strategy for people such as Hendrix and Becker, who go around shouting about ""we the people.""

I guess ""we the people"" matter except when the majority of them don't want Rick Becker to be the NDGOP's candidate for Senate.

For another, this isn't legal. The candidate selection process for the political parties is spelled out in state law that both parties have been following for decades. Should it be in the law? We can have that debate, but there's no getting around the fact that it is, and nobody gets to just ignore the law.

The intellectual argument (if you can call it that) for this maneuvering comes from long-time NDGOP activist Curly Haugland, who has served in various party leadership roles in the past, including chairman and national committeeman.

In a March 27 blog post describing North Dakota's current primary process as ""critical primary theory"" (like critical race theory, get it?), Haugland argues that the law doesn't matter. ""State party rules, as adopted by the NDGOP convention, are superior to state laws,"" he writes. ""The upcoming NDGOP convention has the power, if they choose to use it, to adopt rules giving the delegates the right to NOMINATE candidates as the official Republican nominees in the 2022 general election.""

There's even a website up touting these rule changes called, in a blisteringly obtuse bit of euphemism, the NDGOP ""United as One"" rules package . It's not clear at this point who put the website up, but what it's promoting is in line with Haugland and Hendrix's theories.

This isn't a new argument for Haugland. He even co-authored a book about it in 2016. It's called ""Unbound"" (which is also the name of a ""sexual wellness company"" as I found out from Google while searching for this book). The co-author is Sean Parnell, the Trump-endorsed U.S. Senate candidate in Pennsylvania who had to drop out amid accusations of spousal and child abuse .

What's the end game for the Becker backers?

Chaos, I believe. No court in the land is going to buy the idea that the NDGOP can take a vote at its convention and circumvent long-standing candidate selection law in the middle of an election year.

But Becker is running out of road.

He might win this weekend, but he is almost certainly not going to win in June, so the Becker backers are pursuing a Trumpian plot to justify ignoring the will of the voters.

Kind of like how Trump and his supporters tried to ignore the outcome of the 2020 election.

Will they win in court? I'd bet no, but in Trumpian politics that doesn't really matter as long as whatever you're doing continues to enrage your followers.

By the way, the organizer of the ""stop the steal"" rally that was held in Bismarck after President Joe Biden won the 2020 election?

That was Jared Hendrix .

Anyway, expect the NDGOP convention this weekend to kick off with a fight over who gets to lead the convention, and then a protracted battle over rule changes.",t2_4dmhkybk,From_Adam,0,1648568550.0,0,t1_i2krqm2,i2krqm2,True,lonelyone12345,t3_tr4hv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/tr4hv6/in_true_trumpian_form_us_senate_candidate_rick/,"""In true Trumpian form, U.S. Senate candidate Rick Becker's followers seemingly think they can ignore election law when it doesn't produce the results they want.""",/r/northdakota/comments/tr4hv6/in_true_trumpian_form_us_senate_candidate_rick/i2krqm2/,17,r/northdakota,0,17

"Yeah it's a custom plate, there is a DAV plate you can get according to DOT FAQ, however I couldn't find any specific design for said plate however looking at other plates for Disabled Veterans they seem to have some similar characteristics to them see the following:

1. The plate usually has ""DV"" in a vertical orientation next to the plate number, usually at the beginning of the number but might be at the end, however never in the middle of the number. The characters are also smaller than the plate number. 

2. The plate number is either a 4 or 5 character, and not the traditional 6 character or whatever the standard length for the state is. Due to the ""DV"" if on the plate taking up a space

3. ""Disabled Veteran"" might be spelled out on the plate as well. 

4. It might include a combination  of the following symbols: the handicap wheelchair symbol a special Disabled Veteran seal, or a military seal for the branch served

I was from a big city area so getting used to small town Minot North Dakota was quite an adjustment for me. Depending on where you live in North Dakota depends on how much there is to do. While I'm not religious, I found getting involved with a church and choir if your musically inclined can expand your social group and things to do. I always had my needleworks and crafts as well as my cats and thank goodness for cable TV at the time.

"I'm thinking both federal and state, but I think limits should be high enough so that its not a constant revolving door, but yet helps solve the problem of some of the politicians that stay in the same seat for 30+ years, often because of their ability to prevent things from getting done rather than their ability to get things done.

Someone who makes a career at say, Game and Fish department and works their way up towards the top may have quite the power in their department (Hypothetical example: Walleyes! More Walleyes! Walleye Walleye Walleye Everywhere!!! etc), but won't have much or any sway outside of their sphere of influence, and won't likely have the ear of anyone that actually controls the budget, so they ideally can't waste tons of money. (Ex: Too much money spent on walleye, not enough on Deer/Pronghorn herd management). And HOPEFULLY those more localized problems that do occur can be solved easier since they likely won't require changing laws and won't move at the speed of legislation.

This is in contrast to someone in the state legislature with decades of seniority that works to bend wording or carve exemptions out of all policies, and has budgetary influence to set or change the budget and not only starve some departments of needed funds, but also to potentially waste that money elsewhere.

"So weirdly enough I just moved to the Tampa area from North Dakota. Just a few tips as you fly from Tampa to NoDak. If flying in the winter be prepared for delays coming and going, my wife flew back to visit family in January (I know, not my first choice but its what she wanted) and ended up getting delayed in Denver (connection to Jamestown) by about a day (and ended up stuck in Valley city one day of her visit due to other travel but thats neither here nor there). So just be prepared or travel only during the warm weather...which...if you've been in Florida for a long long time might just be the best advice. North Dakota winter can be something else if you're not used to it.  What airport you do pick is going to usually limit what airlines you can fly out of a Tampa on so keep that in mind as well as the fact that the airports in NoDak don't have quite as many flight options in and out. The upside of this is the line at security is never really long (though one time I had business travel and ended up hitting the airport at the same time as a bunch of college sports teams in for a tournament and that was a thing for that single poor TSA agent they had) .

"First of all, the sheriff said she was the killer in the press conference. Second of all, they are charging a cold case after 15 years. Do you realize the level of assuredness, the level of preparation, and the preponderance of evidence that has to be present for either of these two things to happen? And did I say she shouldn’t see inside a court of law?  Did I say she should go straight to jail without a trial? No. 

You act like the sheriff and prosecutor just woke up one day, stretched, and said “I don’t know bro maybe it’s a good day to charge this murder.” There’s an incredibly laborious process that led up to this point that gives me a large amount of confidence that they have the right person.
That said, I feel pretty comfortable saying she’s the murderer. I’m not going to apologize for calling it out because some lawyer wannabe online tells me to. But being a murderer and being convicted and sentenced for murder are two different things, clearly. So yes, she is not yet convicted of murder. But she is, nonetheless, a murderer.

"Here is a simple overview of the State oil Tax breakdown. 

[https://www.treasurer.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/OG%20Flow%20Charts%20(15-17%20Biennium).pdf](https://www.treasurer.nd.gov/sites/www/files/documents/OG%20Flow%20Charts%20(15-17%20Biennium).pdf) 

Here is the actual laws breaking down the oil tax

[https://www.ndlegis.gov/cencode/t57c51.pdf](https://www.ndlegis.gov/cencode/t57c51.pdf)

Take a look at the slides from the state Treasurer and you'll see that the lions share of the money was used on the Western half of the state. Most of the funds ended up in Hub cities, which in short are any city with more then 12,500 pop. in a county that produces oil. 

20% of all the funds went to the School trusts alone, most of that money and funds were used on hub cities for the Boom. 1% increase in Taxes would be nowhere near what was needed to cover the population growth from oil. Unless specials on property were used or something more draconian.  

Where you would see most of the direct money getting spent in the Valley was on Research up at UND at their Energy research Laboratory which accounts for like less then half percent of the funding.",t2_1gsw0yjb,BjornAltenburg,0,1647377381.0,0,t1_i0sqqn4,i0sqqn4,False,iseedeadllamas,t3_tegm9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/tegm9o/as_someone_originally_from_williston_i_get_it/,As someone originally from Williston… I get it,/r/northdakota/comments/tegm9o/as_someone_originally_from_williston_i_get_it/i0sqqn4/,2,r/northdakota,0,2

"With the caveat that my experience was several years back, there are all of the different kinds of workers there that you would need to run a mining town.  McMurdo is the biggest base on Antarctica, though the population is quite small even in the height of the summer.  As I understood it:

Pros:  High pay, great benefits, and living a chunk of your year in a handpicked community where you're surrounded by many of the smartest people in the world; you get to work in one of the most amazing places in the world; if you are a scientist, a field safety technician/mountaineer, or a helicopter pilot, you get to go to places that almost no one else has ever seen.

Cons: You are not free to roam off base, except for three or four designated trails;  summer workers have to pass extensive physical and psychological exams and it's harder for overwinter workers; people on the base talk about divorces and suicides among year-rounders as sad but not surprising - so those appear to be significant risks.",t2_16iafy,judoberg,0,1647351081.0,0,t1_i0qwie9,i0qwie9,False,judoberg,t3_tdhlg1,https://www.reddit.com/r/northdakota/comments/tdhlg1/the_thing_i_miss_about_north_dakota/,The thing I miss about North Dakota.,/r/northdakota/comments/tdhlg1/the_thing_i_miss_about_north_dakota/i0qwie9/,1,r/northdakota,0,1
