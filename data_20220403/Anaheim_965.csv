"Thanks and great question!

I'm initially avoiding restaurants because they open/close/move so often that it would be hard to keep up to date and distract the focus of my mission. Events are a similar predicament and something I hope to address in Round 2, but focusing on the meat and potatoes for now (pun intended).

That being said, there are 2 situations where I'd consider adding a restaurant:  
\-- If a restaurant is truly legendary and has a historical reason for being included  
\-- If it is a component of a local/regional identity

Examples of those would include [Eating Crabcakes](https://bucketlisted.com/crabcakes/) on my [Baltimore Bucket List](https://bucketlisted.com/baltimore/) and [eating cheesesteaks in Philly](https://bucketlisted.com/philly-cheesesteak/).

"For what it's worth, I live close by and I love taking some Jav's bbq into Unsung. Both are really good. 

Jav's might not be the most friendly to the vegetarian and vegan members of your party, but as the above commenter suggests the Packing House is directly across the street and it's basically a giant food court with tons of options including many that are veg/vegan friendly. 

There's also a good Indian place just across from the Packing House that will have some good vegetarian options.

"These all have different vibes depending on what you want (fast casual vs. full table service vs. brewery/outside chill vibes etc.) but its something to look through and consider. 

[Modern Times Leasuretown](https://goo.gl/maps/7GttmP6AiG7pviUb7) \- This place is a brewery with outdoor seating on multiple levels including a cool renovated old house, there's also a pool if you're feeling it. The whole menu is vegan but as not-a-vegan myself everything I've had here is super good you wouldn't even know it was all vegan. They also have a large bar and its a chill vibe. And because its all just outdoor seating you can easily just throw a bunch of tables chairs in an area together to fit 20.  This is also counter ordering, then just go sit wherever you want type of place.

[Puesto Anaheim](https://goo.gl/maps/5K3UwhjbCixrtXw69) \- I'm putting this in because its really close to the convention center. Its upscale (admittedly pricey) Mexican food, but its good. It's got a trendy vibe and a pretty big dining room so I'd assume they can accommodate 20, though a reservation wouldn't be a bad idea.

[Ballast Point Anaheim](https://goo.gl/maps/hF3vkCJnaiP4BRyg8)\- Adding this because its located in Downtown Disney. Its another pub food/brewery vibe place but has a good sized indoor/outdoor dining area where if you made a reservation you could probably get 20 in there. As far as restaurants in Downtown Disney go, it's one of the better ones in my experience (Do not do yourself the disservice of going to Tortilla Joe's ever in your life). 

You also have the [Gardenwalk](https://g.page/TheGardenWalk?share) which has all your chain places (Bubba Gump Shrimp, Cheesecake Factory, PF Changs, California Pizza Kitchen, etc.), but is very close to the convention center. Not the most exciting but good backups.

"About a mile from Disney is the anaheim packing house with lots of little restaurants in one building. My favorite is georgias southern food. There’s a speakeasy called blind rabbit - try to get a reservation there on their website. Down the street from the packing house is center street where someone already mentioned craft - we LOVE craft. Food is incredible but service is even better! HIGHLY recommend the ranch if you can get there. There’s the garden walk right by the parks too that has some more chain restaurants but it’s still a fun place to go. My favorite thing to do for out of towners is the rooftop bar called the fifth. It’s right outside DCA and you can see the rides and everything. I liked their food a lot too! You’ll need a res for there as well. 

I’m not sure how willing you are to travel but if you want Asian there’s little Saigon in Westminster. There’s a ton of amazing places in Newport/Costa Mesa area that I can give recs for if interested. 

I love puesto which is right outside the park. Downtown Disney also has good places. We love the ballast point brewery- great food.

Lived in Chicago and moved back here in 2020. I’m assuming you took the Ike to commute. I did the same. LA is a different beast - you’re going to be miserable signing yourself up to commute in that. It’s not a joke when people complain about the traffic here. Doesn’t matter if you’re used to it. I live in anaheim and we luckily bought in April 2020 but even out townhome was close to 800k. The company we bought with is building again close to the packing house so research into that area but it won’t be cheap. I’d suggest finding a home in LA where you won’t have to deal with the 5. I have family in el sereno which is east LA. They live in a decent neighborhood that in my opinion is up and coming.

"Well it's not great but it's not Detroit.... but the good news is after years of talk the city is beginning to clean it up. Just up the street the Beach/ Lincoln development is underway which includes a few properties on Beach. Sure they'll be high-end condos but still better than what's there. The city also just put two motels use permits on notice last week for violating their operating permits. They are probably the first of a handfull that will get pushed out for new development over the next decade. With the urgency to build more housing, I can imagine this process may get streamlined from the state/county.

Important to note that the city is in the final stages of taking back that corridor from Caltrans to begin the process for undergrounding utilities between Ball and Lincoln.

"You'll love it here if you just follow a few simple rules.

1) Stay in your apartment between sundown and sunup and make sure all the bars on the doors and windows are locked from the inside.

2)During the day only travel in groups of 3 or more. 5 if you're female.

3) Program your phone to speed dial 911. You may not have time to punch in all three numbers.

4) A fine army surplus store is located on Beach just inside Stanton, where you can probably obtain Kevlar vests and flack jackets. Just don't use 911 in Stanton, because you will get the OC Sheriff rather than the much less blood thirsty Anaheim cops.

5) Further down Beach Blvd.  there is probably the largest junkyard in all of Orange County. A fine place to spend the day looking at wrecked cars and playing with the junkyard dogs. You might want to check out Maxwell Dog Park first, if you are not use to playing with dogs.  Or Home Run Park if you need to get use to swinging a bat again.

"Not in Anaheim, but a couple years ago my coworker was on vacation and they left the hotel and went to dinner and when they came back they didn't notice someone had went into their room and stole his iPad but the following day pictures started showing up in his cloud of some dude taking selfies. 

After a while they figured out their iPad was missing and the guy who stole it worked at the hotel. You have to be pretty stupid to do something like that. 

The manager was able to recover the ipad, they didn't call the police but gave them one night free. 

My coworker didn't want to make a big deal about it because he's a really nice guy but I was like you should have called the police and then demanded more than one night free from that hotel.

"If you are willing to look at apartments, then Platinum Triangle is a great spot and is 5 to 10 minutes away from Disney Castmember Parking.

There are also some nice neighborhoods that may have houses to rent that are 15 to 20 minutes away from Disneyland, in Anaheim.  The neighborhoods I'm thinking about are in an area where the 91 Freeway is the North border, State College is the West border, Katella as the South border and the Orange/Anaheim City limits is the East border.

You might also have a chance to rent a small historic home, or the back house to a large historic home, in the Colony District.  (La Palma is the North Border, 5 Freeway is the West Border, South Street is the South Border and Anaheim Blvd is the East Border).  There is also a new apartment building over there known as City Ctr.  Colony District is 5 to 15 minutes away from Disneyland.

Near the Colony District is Anaheim Packing District.  There are some new build homes over there that are worth looking at.  Plus that Packing District is a great hang out and dining area.  The homes (and some new build apartments) are along Anaheim Blvd Between Sana Ana Street and Vermont Ave.  There is also a newly built community along Santa Ana Street between Olive and East Street.  10 to 15 minutes away from Disneyland.

Lastly, if you are tempted with the idea of purchasing a home, some brand new construction is taking place on Anaheim Blvd next to the Radisson Blu Hotel.  Those homes are 5 minutes away from Castmember parking.

"It is in fact legit, i currently work for this program and its actually part of the california lifeline program, the state sends reps to drop off phones as emergency lines to help people with benefits, this is how you know they are legit. 


1.They have a badge that says they are an authorized worker for the company like assurance wireless,
 or the government phone programs. 

2. They  have the box in their hand with the phone. 
And actually activate the phone. 

3. They always have a state issued tablet in their hand and never use their phone 



Always ask questions about the product knowledge asking where exactly who they are and how the program works. But yes they are legit if they pass those criteria

California life/Assurance reps will never ask for your full social, 

they never ask for any other personal information other than your government benefit. And everything goes straight to the state of californias california lifeline programs system, 

Were regular people just trying to assist people all i ask is please be gentle with us cause it does drain us being yelled at we do try to explain and help you with great intentions😅

"seconding the drive up the windy road to grifith observatory. very enjoyable but don't forget to pay for parking. 
skip the hollywood walk of fame. 
instead drive by the lacma ""urban light"" installation on the other side of la. (maybe the la brea tar pits since you're in the area) on the way to the santa monica pier for some rides and funnel cake. 
of possible interest is the famous shop, ""the last bookstore "" in downtown la. 
san pedro fish market for enormous platters of assorted sea food right by the water if you guys are into that sort of thing 
if you/your teens like harry potter or friends, the warner bros studio tour might be nice since they focus heavily on those the last time i went ~3 years ago. 


in orange county: 
whale watching boat trip in dana point or newport beach. if you're in the area in the evening/night the balboa fun zone is a nice, little stroll with a ferris wheel and old timey feel. 
if shopping is on of your guys' thing,  costa mesa has south coast plaza, the second largest shopping mall in the county i think(?). they have everything. 
also see the small tide pools in corona del mar, laguna beach.
if you guys get tired of the urban sprawl, check out the secluded grove of redwood trees in carbon canyon regional park, one of the few in southern california. 


in anaheim proper, the packing district is a good place to meander through looking a little places to eat with interesting decor. 
idk if you've tried this before but definitely check out a korean bbq restaurant like gen to have a good time with some tasty food. 
check out /r/orangecounty 's list of places to eat. but i stand behind cali tacos. their angel and cali burritos are heavenly.

If you want a low key theme park for a day, Knotts Berry Farm (15 min from Disneyland) has fun rides and delicious boysenberry food items.

> Last month, Oath Keepers member Jason Dolan, 45, of Wellington, Florida, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and one count of obstruction of an official for his role in the breach, making him the third Oath Keeper to be convicted in the federal prosecution.

"like someone else said, r/orangecounty is way more active but i can address some of your questions here

1. anaheim is huge so there's obv good and sketchy parts. east anaheim closer to orange is nicer
2. can't really suggest anything tbh. i enjoy nightlife personally. there's the santa ana river bike trail that takes you all the way down to the beach though.

4. traffic isn't awful, but it does get pretty congested around the 57/91 junction. going southbound during the afternoon is fine, but once you get closer to 5pm, the 22 west gets backed up and it affects the 57 southbound. 

around 2-3pm going northbound from the 5 to the 57 is usually pretty congested, obv getting worse the closer it gets to 5. the 91 going eastbound from fullerton/west anaheim is pretty much always congested at all times

going northbound towards brea/fullerton usually isn’t too bad until closer to 5. and exiting lambert off the 57 N is a nightmare atm due to construction.

"“A large part of Anaheim’s debt stems from $510 million borrowed for the 1990s Anaheim Resort expansion”

What was the 1990’s expansion? $1.95 billion investment in the Anaheim Resort by Walt Disney Parks and Resorts ($1.4 billion) and the city of Anaheim ($550 million) used to build and/or renovate:

 o Disney California Adventure Park
o Disney’s Grand Californian Hotel & Spa o Downtown Disney District
o Disneyland Drive pedestrian bridge
o Mickey & Friends Parking Structure
o Anaheim Convention Center expansion
o Extensive freeway and road improvements
o Storm drains, sewer, water system and electrical improvements
o Landscaping, gateway monuments, signs

So Anaheim’s largest debt is a Disney subsidy from 30 years ago.

"Crime-wise, I don’t think Disney has much impact. There are rough areas near Disney but they’re not particularly accessible from the tourist areas. And locals don’t go into the tourist areas too much, mostly because parking is impossible and the crowds are huge. Anaheim isn’t the wealthy place Newport Beach or Irvine is, but having lived in actual dangerous areas before, Anaheim isn’t one of them.

The city as a whole is gentrifying pretty rapidly, I live about a mile from the parks and both the “Platinum Triangle” near the stadium and the downtown area are gentrifying toward us. 

Having Disney in town does mean a break on taxes. Anaheim has the lowest property tax rates in the county. And because we have our own power utility (not directly related to Disney, but their support keeps it running) my electricity is half the price it would be in Northern California. 

A huge chunk of the jobs are at Disney, so when they had to shut down, the city economy tanked pretty hard. But Disney also then volunteered their parking lot for a coronavirus testing drive thru and later a vaccination drive thru site. 

One annoying thing is the noise. The fireworks you do get used to, but for a while they were trying to have two fireworks shows a night and that annoyed the crap out of me and the neighbors.

One final nice thing is that there never airplane noise despite the fact that were close to both Long Beach and John Wayne airports.

"I’d be interested to hear more about the rumors you are hearing. I live 1 mile from Disneyland and it has taken 60 years for it to become this big. Sure, Disney may have bought some property in the middle of nowhere but you will have years of notice before they even start to break ground. Then it’s probably another 3-5 years tops before they would even be open. On the positive side, it brings in a massively large tax chunk every year for Anaheim which is used to improve the city. It would likely drastically upgrade your entire city over time which could be a game changer for the local economy.

"Im just citing the federal government's census bureau  for supplemental poverty rate which is more accurate. You can read the bureau's criteria for yourself, but  this takes into account cost of living and other factors like govt assistance. For instance, like when the president was pushing for the child refundable tax credit because it would lift x number of families ""out of poverty"", he is referring to the supplemental poverty rate going down as a result. (Im glad he s pushing to make it permanent btw). If CA govt could ever get its act together on housing it would go along way to reducing us from that position.
