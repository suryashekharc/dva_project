"I'm so sorry to hear that. I can relate though. I got fired from a decently paying job I liked with benefits last October and after getting a bunch of interviews from several companies I was interested in, I still wasn't hired. It got me pretty depressed. More than I've been in a long time. This is on top of the fact that last January I couldn't get enough financial aid to pay for college so I had to drop out and I'm 18 credit hours away from graduating. But fortunately after I reconnected with a wealthy uncle of mine, he offered to pay for the rest of my school and any related expenses I might have. That plus doing more things I used to love to do but haven't recently has really helped reinvigorate my drive for just doing things. I reapplied for jobs again, I go on more dates with my wife, I hang out with my old college buddies more often and I try to keep my exercise up as much as I can. It hasn't made everything better but I feel a lot better than I have in about a year. 

Anyways there's a place called Studio 8 my wife has gone to a couple of times and really likes it off of Broadway just east of Pearland Parkway. They're apparently fairly affordable too.

"It's not all ""trails"" strictly, but I get a lot of ""off street"" mileage taking the multi-use path that runs along Bailey.  It starts at CR90 and runs all the way to Pearland Parkway.  I take the trail along Pearland Parkway over to Dixie Farm Rd.  There's a bike lane, but it's pretty poorly maintained and the ""sidewalk"" along it is actually a wide multi-use, so I prefer to stay up on it.  (I wish Pearland would do like Houston has been and put dedicated paint and the heavy rubber bumpers along it for better separation from the high speed traffic)

I take that out to Blackhawk (trail ends about a 1/4 mile short sadly, so a short run on Dixie Farm there).  Then, into Dixie Farm Road Park and pick up the Southbelt Hike/Bike Trail.  

That opens options like a loop through Green Tee, which isn't a trail, but pretty quiet streets in the neighborhood.  I'll often take the Southbelt trail to the end and then make my way through the neighborhood (whose name escapes me just now) and over to the current north end of the Clear Creek Trail.  You can [see it in satellite view near this playground](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.5783372,-95.2584957,390m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e4)

The Clear Creek Trail will currently take you down to a small park near the entrance of Green Tee.  From there, you can get onto Liberty and get over to Independence Park.  I like to turn off Liberty south of City Hall and wind through that neighborhood to get to the trail that runs along Mary's Creek to the park. [The end of that trail is here](https://www.google.com/maps/@29.5425662,-95.2562141,197m/data=!3m1!1e3!5m1!1e4)

Yeah but they don’t enforce the no-fishing rule. I think it’s just so people do t eat the fish. All of the ponds are pretty much the same.

"I started my first business at 14. I made up flyers and posted them offering summer tutoring for K-4 kids (today facebook groups may be the way to go). We just worked through some addition and subtraction sheets, made art projects, and did some reading a few hours a week. I had 10 kids but usually didn't have more than 2 at a time. Their parents would drop them off for about 2 hours and return to pick them up. I charged $10 an hour at the time, $20 would seem appropriate today. It was a win-win. Parents were able to get a break from the kids for a few hours and the kids kept their school skills sharp. Summer learning loss is a real thing. Half of kids lose about 3 months of learning a summer. Compound that with covid distance learning and you have a real market this year. It wasn't awesome money but for a 14 year old $2000 over the summer wasn't bad for working 2-3 hours a day.

"Big Star really pissed me off. Made an appointment for some simple items and then they wanted at least 3 days with my truck. I told them that I made an appointment to avoid the 3 day nonsense and they said the appointment isn’t really an appointment. Any time I call them it’s a minimum of 3 days (for anything outside of oil change and tire rotations). So for service they’re a no for me. They’re good for just picking up parts. 

For sales, HELL NO. They fit all their trucks with ridiculous add-ons that aren’t mentioned on the website. They put plastic bed liners in ALL their truck beds and want like $650 for them. The 90’s called, they want their plastic bed liners back!! (Sorry, that really gets me going lol)

Then, I found a truck that checked all my boxes, called to verify the truck was there and it was. Get to the dealer and it had like 5k miles on it. Nowhere online or on the phone did anyone tell me it was a demo, and it wasn’t priced like a demo should have been.

"email from Pearland Citizen Alerts:

 Due to a combination of persistent factors, the City of Pearland public  water system has fallen below the minimum pressure threshold of 20 PSI  and is required to notify all customers in Pearland to boil their water  prior to consumption (e.g., washing hands/face, brushing teeth,  drinking.) Any water used for drinking, cooking, and ice should be  boiled and cooled prior to use. The water should be brought to a  vigorous rolling boil for a two-minute duration. If you have any  questions concerning this matter, you may contact the City of Pearland  Public Works Department at 281.652.1900 or read FAQs at  pearlandtx.gov/BoilWater.   


The timing for the end of this boil  water notice is uncertain at this time as it is dependent on the ability  to bring the system up to safe pressure levels (40-60 PSI), and then  receive clean test results (18-24 hours after water pressure has been  stabilized).",t2_262gjl9,BuddTX,0,1613518518.0,0,t1_gnpdih7,gnpdih7,True,tritox,t3_llgca4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/llgca4/boil_water_notice_21621/,Boil Water Notice 2-16-21,/r/Pearland/comments/llgca4/boil_water_notice_21621/gnpdih7/,4,r/Pearland,0,4

"First time home buyer. Do you understand how MUD/property tax rates work? The rate is 3.76% to 3.85%. You're going to be burning $12k a year on a 2,000 sq. ft $300,000 cookie cutter house with a tiny lot.

$12K a year for 2,000 sq. ft.

THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND.

Your house will never go up in value like the houses with much lower tax rates around you. I hate to sound like an ass but i'm telling you like it is. That area is filled with first time home owners and just plain inexperienced buyers that don't even think about their tax bill. Or they did ask and their realtor lied and said that with time the tax rate will decrease. That's a lie even if it does decrease it might go from 3.8% to 3.5% in 15 years.

Getting back to why your house will never go up in value like other homes. Those inexperienced buyers eventually realize that all that money they've been paying monthly has mostly went to taxes and not principle. Then the epiphany hits them. What kind of as$ h\*le pays $12k in taxes for a small cookie cutter house? They eventually sell and it's a non stop cycle that brings home values down. 

Think about it, there's not that many suckers to go around. As time passes eventually something has to give. And it won't be the tax rate. HINT\* IT'S THE HOME PRICES THAT GIVE.

Look on HAR and see how many homes are for sale/pending in that new area of Riverstone, where the home is only a few years old. Then go look right next door and see how many homes are for sale in Green Tee Terrace. The houses in Green Tee are old and most of them have not been updated but they are all $300k -$700k",t2_4dw2t7q,BriefPiano2,0,1598948660.0,0,t1_g3kesvs,g3kesvs,True,jepstingnaina,t3_ic79fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/ic79fq/meritage_homesriverstone_ranch/,Meritage Homes/Riverstone Ranch?,/r/Pearland/comments/ic79fq/meritage_homesriverstone_ranch/g3kesvs/,1,r/Pearland,0,1

"> I have never experienced a hurricane before

My first hurricane I was vacationing in Jamaica.  It threw all of us into a bit of a panic because we were all from the midwest and had never dealt with a hurricane before.  Fortunately, it was free booze at the resort, which calmed things down a lot.  Oh and pot.  That country is FULL of pot.

Turned out that hurricane was not much different than a long rain.

Next, I was in Key West during hurricane Katrina.  Fun times man...  Fun times.  That was a level 2.  Ya know the worst, windy rainstorm you ever experienced in the NE?  Ya know the part that has really violent winds and rain that lasts about 20 minutes?  Imagine that for a day or two.  Trees that look like they want to rip out of the ground, hellacious rain.  The thing is - it was all fine.  Aside from a friend's hotel room getting a little flooded with an inch of water, it was basically wind and rain.

Then...  Oh man...  Hurricane Ike.  That was kind of devastating - and I was in Ohio!  The 80 mph winds from hurricane Ike ripped through OH, causing a lot of trees to fall down, some of which ripped down power lines.  Insurance paid for a new roof, which was good because it was due to be replaced anyway.

Then... Harvey.  It was five days solid of rain.  Lots of flooding.  I dunno...  I Forrest Gumped my way through that one, and ended up just fine.

So...  My point is don't panic.  Just be aware.  You may have to change plans, but you may not.  But again, don't panic.",t2_9nar1,CaptainIncredible,0,1598339157.0,0,t1_g2s0lv4,g2s0lv4,True,uconnguest,t3_ifra0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/ifra0q/best_evacuation_route/,Best evacuation route,/r/Pearland/comments/ifra0q/best_evacuation_route/g2s0lv4/,-1,r/Pearland,0,-1

"> Don't drive through high water

Yup this.  I was here in Houston for the first time ever during the Tax Day flood. From what I recall 7 people died.

I reviewed it later.  In every one of those 7 cases, the person was in a car, driving on a road they were very familiar with.  They saw what looked to be a shallow puddle, but was actually a deep mini-lake.

They drove into it, car stalled and became a boat.  Cars are not designed to be boats, so sooner or later, they sink.

At that point you are a rat in a sinking cage and if you want to live you need to GTF outta that car/boat.  Abandon ship.  Get to a curb.

"Welcome to Pearland! 

We have had Verizon wireless for years and have been very happy with it. 

As for internet, we used AT&T and recently switched to Xfinity. Internet service depends on where you live because some of our neighbors had access to higher speeds that we did not. We didn't have access to AT&T fiber and was told that they were done installing it in our area as they we starting to move on to 5G. We were paying the same amount as neighbors with fiber (sometimes more) and could only get the 15mbps download package. On weekends, we were down to 3 mbps and I swear I could hear the old dial up sounds - it was absolutely horrible! We love Xfinity and are zooming at almost 200 mbps now and not looking back.

If you have access to AT&T fiber and choose them for internet, just make sure you are getting a fair deal. Do some comparison shopping because they certainly aren't consistent in their services.",t2_14r5g9,ChemGirl219,0,1582639435.0,0,t1_fiqa5qa,fiqa5qa,True,[deleted],t3_f90w4l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/f90w4l/moving_to_pearland/,Moving to Pearland...,/r/Pearland/comments/f90w4l/moving_to_pearland/fiqa5qa/,2,r/Pearland,0,2

"I've used all 4 major carriers in Pearland for work-related reasons, and Verizon has the most consistent coverage across the entire town.

That said, my personal cell is t-mobile, and I find that disabling LTE (and thus falling back onto t-mobile's HSPA+ network) works very consistently everywhere in town.

I'm sure some may require the faster LTE speeds, but I can stream 480p video consistently with no issues on tmobile's HSPA+, even in the LTE coverage dead areas.

tl;dr -- Verizon if you want / need consistent LTE and don't mind paying for it.

I got you fam. https://propaccess.trueautomation.com/ClientDB/PropertySearch.aspx?cid=51 this is the Brazoria County Appraisal District site. Search the address and you can see what the taxes are. Just make sure to check the exemptions and such in case you've got a senior citizen with frozen taxes.,t2_cmket,generalvostok,0,1572791080.0,0,t1_f6d3pyk,f6d3pyk,True,shadmere,t3_dr0xuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/dr0xuy/property_taxes_how_do_i_find_how_much_id_actually/,Property taxes?

"SCR has a weird combo of different counties, school districts, city and mud taxes. Depending on what area of SCR the tax rate is between 3.2 and 3.75 cents per $100. The property taxes, for the most part, went down in 2019. The valuation increase was not enough to be double. The only thing that I can think of is a frozen tax rate and valuation for people over 65. Home values in that area are up 100k over the past 10-15 years. It would definitely explain a jump in taxes if the home came back on the market.",t2_fe9rik2,RookTx,0,1572546698.0,0,t1_f5xv4gd,f5xv4gd,True,gayang3,t3_dmb792,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/dmb792/what_on_earth_happened_to_taxes_in_2019/,What on earth happened to taxes in 2019???,/r/Pearland/comments/dmb792/what_on_earth_happened_to_taxes_in_2019/f5xv4gd/,2,r/Pearland,0,2

"Are you sure you're not looking at properties with lapsed homestead exemptions?

I know with with the growth cap for homestead exemptions, sometimes property market values are growing faster than they can increase the tax value, then they adjust it up when someone moves out. I know after 4 years of ownership, my house would probably appraise for a good $30-40k more than my tax appraisal value based on some quick math I did when I was wondering if a refi was worth it based my neighbor's sales prices on my street last year or so.",t2_sioc1,VeseliM,0,1571944273.0,0,t1_f51tsa4,f51tsa4,True,gayang3,t3_dmb792,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pearland/comments/dmb792/what_on_earth_happened_to_taxes_in_2019/,What on earth happened to taxes in 2019???,/r/Pearland/comments/dmb792/what_on_earth_happened_to_taxes_in_2019/f51tsa4/,1,r/Pearland,0,1
