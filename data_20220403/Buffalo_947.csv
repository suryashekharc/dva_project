* Climate controlled, glass enclosed Main Street.
* Wheatfield/Pendleton jetport to replace BUF.

"Rule of thumb: (sale price - lot price - architect's fees) - 15%-20% = construction cost.  Houses from the wnd of WWII to the early 1950s often used recycled late Depression-era floor plans.   They might have plaster walls, hardwood floors, and solid doors, but the physical plant (heating, plumbing electrical) were usually quite basic.

Structurally, they weren't any better than today's houses; folks have been saying ""they only build them to last 25 years"" since the early days of production housing in the late 1800s.

There were a lot of brick new builds during the 1950s.  I don't know why, considering that Buffalo was a frame city since the late 1800s.

Improved building lots were cheap.  Buffalo's suburbs had tens of thousands of improved lots thanks to extensive premature subdivision in the 1920s.  Tonawanda was the national poster child for premature subdivision.  The Depression hit, taxes were left unpaid, and Erie County foreclosed on many of them.  The County sold these surplus lots to builders from the late 1930s through the 1960s.  They still own hundreds of lots in paper subdivisions in the Southtowns and eastern suburbs.",t2_5a4n1,dan_blather,0,1649006156.0,0,t1_i38th16,i38th16,False,dan_blather,t3_tu6u4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/tu6u4i/1950_when_a_new_starter_home_in_tonawanda_was/,1950.

"I appreciate everything that you have said but you are talking to somebody who is owed $2,500 from the state of New York Rental Assistance Program. As a landlord I was cooperative with tenants that didn't feel they could pay the rent the last two months of their lease, that was October and November 2021. So they moved out in December and we've had new tenants that pay every month since then but I found out recently the state of New York is out of money to pay landlords so I'll just go fuck myself I guess. Meanwhile I've got property taxes to pay and they've got to have a couple hundred dollars for the new stadium... 

So while I understand that there are a lot of moving parts, New York state is a clusterfuck of bullshit bureaucracy that deserves to be gutted from one end of the other and rebuilt from scratch before somebody tries to convince me that we all need to pay for a new football stadium.",t2_5bhql,TechnicallyMagic,0,1649003375.0,0,t1_i38mquw,i38mquw,False,Random_Nihilist,t3_ts39co,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/ts39co/opinions/,Opinions?,/r/Buffalo/comments/ts39co/opinions/i38mquw/,0,r/Buffalo,0,0

"There are several mentions of cocktails well predating Kitty Hustler. Cocktail historian David Wondrich has looked into it and it dates earlier to England where the term was taken from horse traders who would put a piece of ginger in an older horse’s rear end to make it act more lively (as one would) to make the horse appear younger and more spry. English gentlemen would have a quick drink of Genever mixed with sugar, bitters, water, and sometimes a bit of muddled ginger in the morning as a “hair of the dog” on their way to the club or horse track. 

The story with Kitty is she kept some colorful rooster feathers from birds the soldiers would steal for her to cook, and use the quill to stir the drinks, the drink the having been made with a “cock’s tail”. 

Kitty did harbor several residents of Lewiston when the British burned down the village in the war of 1812.

The reason the waterfront is starting to thrive is because businesses that didn't respect nature left and we can now use the River for recreation and thats spurring more nature friendly businesses. 

Back when businesses weren't held accountable they just polluted the environment and literally killed the River. People like you said they could do whatever they want and shouldn't have to be ""regulated"".

So if you buy a home, it increases in value by 100% over 10 years, for property tax purposes your house only increased in value 20%. So now you’re paying less in than you would if you sold and bought another similar real value home. Combine this with poor planning, surging demand, and NIMBYs you have an absolutely warped market.

"Nothing about the land being ceded to NY was illegal. It was the result of a war in which, as is typical, one side won and the other lost. This is how land has traded hands for millennia and it’s how much of the land occupied by the Iroquois Confederacy / Seneca at the time had come under their control. It wasn’t illegal for them to take it from the Erie or the various other tribes they defeated in warfare and it wasn’t illegal for NY to do it either. 

The only difference was when they did it they ensured the people they defeated were destroyed as a people and either killed or assimilated into their culture and when NY did it they allowed the defeated peoples to continue to exist and tried to provide land on which they could do so.

"> You’re putting words in my mouth.

These are you exact words:

> The point about that we know Rick, is yes he's been investing so long, **yes he gets a pass because he appreciates the neighborhood and is enhancing it instead of making it worse.**

Making it worse is an _opinion_.  It could be an opinion by every single resident or property owner in the OFW but it's still an opinion.  As I said before, the entire purpose of the Green Code and regulations in general is to avoid having to deal with emotions and opinions.  

From the article the project has been stalled because

- the developer failed to include a required environmental form among its documents
- the city panel failed to lay out its findings in writing
- the Waterfront Consistency Review Law wasn't followed

The project was not stalled because of the design of the structure, parking or traffic issues or how friendly or considerate the developer is with people living in the OFW.  Those behind the lawsuit also mentioned how it would affect their waterfront views.  But the green code has nothing about maintaining waterfront views to my understanding.  

Now not to put words into your mouth, just what do you mean when you say:

> but if he didn’t do things the right way, he’d hear about it too.

What does ""hear about it"" even mean?  Are you talking about lawyers getting involved or are you saying people will give him an earful at the next event at the Irish Center?  

What I have gathered from our conversation is that you're pretty old school and you care deeply about the neighborhood.  Nothing wrong with either.  Where I feel we diverge is you seem to want to apply old school rules to people you're comfortable with and hold those who you are not to the rule of the law.",t2_e6ra0,justwanttolurk,0,1648839771.0,0,t1_i30ozuo,i30ozuo,False,dekema2,t3_ttps5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/ttps5h/old_first_ward_valley_residents_sue_to_stop/,"Old First Ward, Valley residents sue to stop proposed apartment project",/r/Buffalo/comments/ttps5h/old_first_ward_valley_residents_sue_to_stop/i30ozuo/,1,r/Buffalo,0,1

"Its an old furniture manufacturing factory building. It's being redeveloped into mixed residential and commercial spaces with BCP and historic tax credits, so it should look pretty cool when its all finished up. 

The building though is in god awful shape, so its been a lot of work remediating the Site and structurally rehabbing the building itself. People that live in old industrial areas tend to neglect how much contamination was left by previous industrial activity. A lot of the projects going on in the OFW are in the BCP program and are being remediated under NYSDEC supervision. 

I understand the sentiment of the community and I hope their concerns are addressed, but the levels of metals, PAHs, and other contaminants in that area need to be taken care of.

"No, I understand. A lot of people tend to complain without knowing the full details which gives a false perception on what's actually happening. Reporters and media are especially known for this 

The reality is that all governments need to invest in the community to stimulate economic activity one way or another. In a way, they're always competing with other governments to attract and maintain citizens, tourists, etc. to ensure they have proper funds to take care of their people. (By lieu of charging taxes on said people). 

Larger investments are needed to attract the people who make more - but another example of this is tax breaks given for small businesses, or even the bailouts you see when markets are down. It's in the best interest of the state for these businesses to operate within their jurisdiction (taxes, jobs, etc)

All of this allows the state to then invest back into the community; roads and infrastructure being a huge example of that, but also education, social welfare, etc (again, all of which increase happiness for the citizens, and make them want to stay). There's a balance that needs to be found, but you can't be always 'spending' money with no potential of return. Yes, there is something to be said about quality kf living or humanitarian rights- and the state is allocating a budget to that - but shouldn't overcommit or it'll have negative impact down the line.  

I don't envy the job of the state to have to pick and choose where funds go, whether to investments for the future, expenses to improve quality of living, or even back to taxpayers (who doesn't like money?). At the end of the day, they need to find a good balance of all of this - and do what's right for their citizens (the people who elected them, and choosing to live in the area). There is not a one size fits all nor a way to make everyone happy - it's honestly a lose lose scenario.",t2_jn3yc52d,jake_0527,0,1648830353.0,0,t1_i301b04,i301b04,False,Random_Nihilist,t3_ts39co,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/ts39co/opinions/,Opinions?,/r/Buffalo/comments/ts39co/opinions/i301b04/,1,r/Buffalo,0,1

The point about inexperience is that large things can be glossed over, such as the information he did not supply.

He's throwing so much money at this project that he needs to have all of the units, thats his bad. This shouldn't be pushed through just because the guy has enough money. Due Process. Like you said, if he's building on the waterfront he should be taking extra care with environmental impact paperwork. 

The point about that we know Rick, is yes he's been investing so long, yes he gets a pass because he appreciates the neighborhood and is enhancing it instead of making it worse. 

Both guys aren't going to be pouring concrete, I get that but they are the ones with the vision and ultimate decision maker.

"Just what details do you know about `Joseph Carubba's JC Properties QOZB LLC` other than who is _likely_ leading the financing?  Do you think Carubba is going the one designing the property or swinging a hammer?   There are people you can hire to run the project and those people have experience.  Also to note, even the most experienced developers find themselves fighting with activists over ticky tacky stuff.  It's just the game, experience doesn't change how it is played.  

I didn't ask if anyone knows Rick.  Like I said, I don't know him personally but know Rigidized Metals is a great company that treats those who work there very well.  But that still doesn't resolve the point you made about Carubba and his inexperience in developing a large project.  Both are inexperienced on the projects they are working on or want to work on.  But because Rick is a 'neighborhood guy' you seem to have a different set of rules and values.  Developing a large project and developing a project that some people like are not the same thing.  You seem to be reaching real hard with some mental gymnastics to try and make that connection.

Please do tell me how Hamburg running parallel to Vandalia and both running perpendicular to Republic and South is not a grid?  Yes, I know the tracks in from of McCarthy's doesn't make this a perfect grid without endpoints but it's a grid nonetheless.  Also to note that traffic exists in cities.  Traffic concerns are when you have gridlock not when you might be 3 in line at a stop sign on a nice day.  

> There has already been so many mistakes, this project should absolutely be examined before proceeding.

There is nothing wrong with this opinion.  But a project being examined and slight modifications are not the same as blocking a project because 1) the developer isn't a local guy to the OFW or 2) you don't like apartments.  

You mention cleaning up trash to make the OFW nice.  I commend you on that work.  Let me ask you a question off that.  Who do you think is going to be easier to deal with in keeping the property line maintained, landscaped and looking good?  Someone who owns a home (let alone who lives in the home) where you have no ability to talk about in the public square or a complex owner.  Not only will this complex be well kept because that's needed to drive rental values but it will be well kept because you have the ability to put pressure in the public square.",t2_e6ra0,justwanttolurk,0,1648826030.0,0,t1_i2zqhbp,i2zqhbp,False,dekema2,t3_ttps5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/ttps5h/old_first_ward_valley_residents_sue_to_stop/,"Old First Ward, Valley residents sue to stop proposed apartment project",/r/Buffalo/comments/ttps5h/old_first_ward_valley_residents_sue_to_stop/i2zqhbp/,5,r/Buffalo,0,5

That may be, but in this case it's not. I'm one of them listed here, and obviously I know the others and basically it's all the major business leaders and community organizations, including both Valley and OFW Community Centers.

This is not a ""too much time on their hands"", in fact this is a pain in the ass, and I hate that I have to do it but a project this large, right on our waterfront has to be scrutinized especially when it comes to environmental impact.

This has nothing to do with who can live there, and tbh I don't understand the point as there have already been added nearly 1000 apartment units in the neighborhood in the last 7 years.

I mean it should go for any neighborhood, a project this size from a first time developer is going to have far more problems than someone experienced with a good track record right?

There has already been so many mistakes, this project should absolutely be examined before proceeding.


>Do you have a problem with Silo City? Because that's being done by a guy who owns Rigidized Metals.

Yes everyone in the Ward knows Rick, he's been a property owner in the neighborhood, and sponsors the Regatta every year and is very active in the community. Like everyone knows Rick down here.

So yes someone who has already invested in the area has a better understanding of the neighborhood is 1000x better than a guy thats never set foot into the neighborhood.

Well me being an ahole is besides the point but I'm absolutely the opposite of trash and, I hate bragging but I'm probably responsible for the most trash taken out of the Ward, this is garbage waste as well as trashy people. I'm a steward of the Park, the River and the area. I want to do whats right, not what makes me more money. This project might help me but it's not right for the neighborhood.

>No, neighborhoods should not have the power to determine who gets to come in and build there or live there. If you don't see how this is a problem and a very slippery slope, read the paragraph above again.

It's not a matter of ""who"" but what kind of projects, what scale and how it fits in the neighborhood. That's part of the reason you have to get permits, you can't just let anyone do anything they want. 

>Traffic concerns? Are you serious? It's a freaking city on a massive street grid, and this area has almost as many open lots as it has dilapidated homes. 

This isn't even debatable for anyone whos been down there on a nice day. It's not a grid, so I take it you're not familiar with the area, but it's a right turn with no stop signs, bad parking (should be on other side for Line of Site) when Ohio St bridge is open it gets a TON of truck traffic.  Like I said I'm not even going to get into it now but ask anyone whos launched from there on a nice day how the traffic is.

"> Who cares where the developers are from.

Because people in the car crash business aren't equipped for a development project this large. Just because you have money doesn't make you a suitable developer, although in Buffalo throw a few hundred to the Mayor and you'd be surprised how much red tape you can avoid.

>It’s a good think out of area money is investing again in Buffalo.

The people in the suit have been investing in the neighborhood for 10+ years. The ""out of area"" money is Carrubba Collision, it's not like some French developer is coming in...it's the Car Crash guy.

Neighborhoods like this should have more of a grassroots development like whats happening, not some sim city wanna be that just drops down ugly apartment complex wherever they want.

>It’s called being a neighborhood.

The  people who have invested in the neighborhood for a long time form a neighborhood, plopping a complex is not a neighborhood.

There has been a TON of development, which the neighborhood is good with but this specific project should be looked into before we let them tear down a bunch of houses and cause chaos down there.

"> Elevator Alley is probably joining the suit because they’ll lose their grass area to park kayaks for rentals.

No we won't. Full disclosure, I am Elevator Alley.

We're involved because it's such a bad project. People in here complaining like the OFW are just NIMBYs but we've had 2 large apartments built on Ohio, Resurgence, barco building etc. If anyone says OFW doesn't want development, simply isn't paying attention.

Carrubba is not in the development business and if you've been to any of the meetings you'd see they aren't prepared for this project, it's already been reduced because they didn't know what they're doing, not because of publics demand.

At one of the meetings the rep for them didnt even know those rail tracks are ACTIVE!! How can you miss that? They literally haven't spent longer than a few hours there or they'd see the train that goes back and forth 10 times a day.

The flooding of the ward is as old as the City itself, and this project will only add to that problem.

I most likely would benefit from this project, but I think it's not proper scale and just doesn't fit the neighborhood and has so many poorly thought out issues. So it's literally the opposite of self-interest, same for Bill tbh. 

People in this thread most likely havent invested in our City/Neighborhoods, me and Bill did and have for 10+ years, not some big money guy thats in the car crash hbusiness, not a developer just waltzs in buys all the property for WAY to much and now complains because he might lose money...",t2_dcsn2,sobuffalo,0,1648820563.0,0,t1_i2zdfi0,i2zdfi0,False,dekema2,t3_ttps5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/ttps5h/old_first_ward_valley_residents_sue_to_stop/,"Old First Ward, Valley residents sue to stop proposed apartment project",/r/Buffalo/comments/ttps5h/old_first_ward_valley_residents_sue_to_stop/i2zdfi0/,14,r/Buffalo,0,14

"The Seneca defeated a number of other nations to form their lands. Each of those nations were forced to assimilate into the Seneca nation and losing their identity as a distinct people. 

The Seneca sided with the British in the American Revolution and lost the war. They were forced to cede all land in NY as part of the price and were then granted certain lands back. So we aren’t all living on their land rent free. They obtained their lands in warfare and lost them the same way. Just like has happened all over the world for thousands of years. Only unlike the prior way the Seneca and the rest of the Iroquois Confederacy did things, not to mention most places in the world, the Seneca were allowed to remain a people until themselves. From their they entered into treaties with the US government as well as the government of NYS and sold significant portions of the land they had been provided.

"We moved to NT from Amherst a few years ago.  I love our neighborhood - we’re in Wurlitzer Park - but some areas are a little bit sketchy if you drive 2-3 miles west.  My neighborhood is pretty solidly suburban; large yards, sidewalks, many schools.  I’m guessing the majority of the houses were built in the 70s and 80s.  Our house was sold by the family that built it and raised their family there. 

I don’t have any experience with the schools because our son had graduated before we moved.  It’s an older suburb, and many of the residents are older.  We are surrounded by retired people on our block.  But there are a lot of new younger families with children as well, and our mayor is 12 years old (i jest, he’s in his early 20s - he just looks 12 to me!). 

Pros - proximity to Webster Street (restaurants and theater), close to the canal and the Niagara River, nice people - great neighbors, great farmer’s market in the spring/summer, close to shopping, and Platters ice cream and chocolate is a revelation!  Also, less severe weather than the Southtowns.

Cons - aforementioned sketchy areas, the noise from the new bitcoin plant on Erie (it’s like a constant dull hum), and I honestly feel like it’s such a drive from everywhere.  We used to live in Snyder, right by the 190/290/90/33.  I could get anywhere in @15 minutes.  Now I have to drive 15 minutes down the Colvin extension or NF Boulevard to even get to the 290.

I live in what is probably one of the nicest areas in NT and I’ve got no complaints really.  The schools are all pretty good up until highschool then it’s just a matter of being a good parent and making sure you’re kids are in the right classes etc.  there’s some very very good teachers there (used to teach there).  Otherwise we really enjoy it.  Lots of kids in our neighbor hood that our kids are always out playing with. I don’t feel any worries about them being outside etc.  others have said it’s “dirty” etc but I have no experienced that at all. Street sweepers come by regularly and in our neighborhood everyone takes good. Are of their properties.  I would not be dissuaded at all from living here honestly.

"In general, houses in NT tend to be on the older and disrepaired side compared to other areas locally. We looked a few years ago, and found that we could either get a small ranch for more than our budget, or a larger house in Tonawanda or Amherst for close to our budget.

NT schools are fine, from what I've heard. Husband went and doesn't think he got a bad education. They're not as highly rated as Williamsville or Tonawanda from what I've heard. NT has fewer social services, like community classes and such. Less bus accessibility, if that matters. And the whole love canal/chemical dumping issues.

"You have no idea on the topic you speak. The State was only supposed to receive payments until 2015 as long as exclusivity was maintained in Western New York . At which point it was breached by Hamburg Racino. The contact was in breach and therefore all monies should have been given back to the Nation. Forget the fact that the contract that the state drafted themselves said that payments would end that year and Senecas would actually be able to keep every cent they made without taxation at all. In an effort to maintain a good standing within the community. The Senecas held the money in an escrow account for future payment. The Secretary of Interior is in aggreance.

But also could simply be that Buffalo is on the secondary tour list.

Like if you’re going on your first tour in a few years then you’re probably going to prioritize hitting the largest 25 cities.

Also, probably wouldn’t be an embargo, but could be entertainment companies that booked bands are short staffed or laid key people off during the pandemic.

Actually surprised this is an issue since there’s a HUGE backlog of shows. You’d think with venues booked in other cities, we’d be able to pick up more acts.

NT is sits right on the border with Erie County. If you go across via River, Webster, or Main you're right in Tonawanda, City of. Main and River cross over and become Delaware and Military respectively. 

Through the middle is the Twin Cities which crosses over and becomes Colvin and Eggert. There is also access to the 290 from here (also at Delaware and Elmwood too, IIRC.) 

If you cross TC on Robinson you will also end up in Erie Co, but at Amherst. Robison turns into North French at Niagara Falls BLVD. This intersection is also home to Tops, Kohls, Wegmans, and, soon, Delta Sonic. 

If you cross TC on Wheatfield it turns into Erie Ave and goes out to the NF BLVD. There is also a Walmart there. Erie crosses the BLVD and turns into Shawnee which goes out to Route 31 which runs between the Falls and Lockport. NCCC is on 31 as well as The Res gas stations. 

Also, both River and the BLVD go through NT the otherwise towards the Falls.

And the nation covers health services including dental: [https://www.senecahealth.org](https://www.senecahealth.org)

The money is not all spent on direct payments and the entire rez is not falling apart.

The situation is also more complex than people realize. If you're an American and you want to start a business or get a loan for your existing business you can use property as collateral. Banks are not allowed to own Native land. The US govt is not allowed to own Native land. Therefore in the history of the Seneca nation... no one has ever been able to mortgage or take out a second loan or a third loan on their property. So for instance when President Kennedy allowed the reservation in Pennsylvania to get flooded with the Kinzua Dam... all of the diary farmers and other farmers that had to relocate could not take out loans on their new property to pay for equipment, cows, etc. When health standards for diary changed and the US switched to stainless and pasteurization every farmer in America was allowed to take out cheap loans backed by their property to pay for the upgrades... Natives could not.... bc banks can't own Native land. Every time there was a shift like this in the 20th century it killed whatever similar business was on the reservation.

The reservation is what it looks like when you're removed from the modern financial system and have to slowly play catchup.

~~And fun fact: if youre a dude you cant own property on the rez. There are no restrictions on gender when it comes to elected representatives but for Native property it is still a matriarchy society.

"All fair, but a different issue. This ""Letter to Kathy Hochul"" is specifically about their upset over the use of funds to pay for a stadium.

These are funds that their nation previously refused to pay for years despite having agreements to do so, and literally did cause damage to the areas they are feigning concern about for this letter. They were demanded to pay it through litigious processes and then when they finally paid it, they are complaining about what its used for.

As far as I know, there is no written law about where the gambling income goes to. It generally goes towards highway and road maintenance, but I think that is just a coincidence not a rule. 

One can hate Kathy and support the Nations, but when both sides have dirty hands it gets to be a grey area. In this case, like any politician, Kathy is overplaying that she got the stadium agreement, which any politician would have done. And in this case, it doesn't matter where the money came from because there is no case for ""misusing"" funds that were never designated for any purpose.
