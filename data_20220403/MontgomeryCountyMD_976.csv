"> Ah yes, we should just throw away all the councils mistakes and start from scratch every day.

I guess you need to name call to feel better about your baseless far right talking points being called out.

>But because Karen’s such as yourself keep voting for these authoritarian candidates, the county will continue its downward trend post-Covid.

Well since you've failed to show any authoritarianism I don't think you get to keep using that word. It's weird you keep trying to call me a Karen when all you do is throw tantrums about mask mandates which are long gone.

"I used to attend the Universities at Shady Grove during the latter half of pursuing my Bachelors. I never got an Associates from Montgomery College due to taking classes that helped me transfer to USG instead of taking classes to obtain the Associates. I graduated in December 2015.

It’s a great campus for those who live in the northwest part of Montgomery County, and for those who want a closer relationship with the student body. Nearly the whole campus consists of classrooms as opposed to collegiate halls. Therefore, you tend to have a closer relationship with your classmates and your professor. Also, because USG is, more or less, a creation of the University System of Maryland, it can accept students who wish to graduate as a student from UMD, Bowie State, Towson, etc. However, the main drawback is that USG does not support all degree programs of each university. As for tuition, I’m unsure whether you save any money attending classes at USG compared to attending classes at the main campuses, but you definitely save lots of money attending Montgomery College and then transferring to USG/any main campus than attending a main campus for the full 4 years.

It’s been over 6 years since I graduated, so I can’t tell you how college life at USG is nowadays.

">Does anybody really care at this point? 

Shouldn't a reasonable person follow the news and see if health officials are concerned or not? Which in this case they are not.

>I know the hardcore will wring their hands about how we’re all going to die and “think of the children” but the reality is all the reasonable people are triple vaxxed and kids will be fine.

Easy enough to say when it's not your kid that's under the age to get vaxed. My kid had it in 2020 and it was absolutely brutal, 105 temps and he was almost hospitalized.

>I’m sure this thread will get hot so

Maybe it wouldn't get hot if you didn't throw out hot takes and invent some group of people that are supposedly freaking out over a message of health officials not being concerned.

"Because MoCo has a million people and no 4 year college, USG is a way for several prominent colleges in MD to have a campus here without having to go all in and try to find land or build an entire campus.  There are several different colleges hosting programs there.

MC does have good articulation agreements with folks at USG, but we (I teach at MC.) also have similar agreements for most colleges in the state if you go directly to their campus.  But the programs/majors at Shady Grove May have a particular arrangement with MC.  For example, my discipline has a very good relationship with UMBC social work at USG.

MC is a great community college—the pandemic has hit us hard, but the entire education system has been upended by COVid.  I’ve been a big proponent of moving back to campus because we are losing many students who just can’t focus and get a good quality education in the online environment.",t2_e2r5kqq1,ResProf,0,1648739413.0,0,t1_i2utyg7,i2utyg7,True,molleraj,t3_tsp456,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tsp456/anyone_know_much_about_usg/,Anyone know much about USG?,/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tsp456/anyone_know_much_about_usg/i2utyg7/,8,r/MontgomeryCountyMD,0,8

>“It also infers that because not seeing hospitalization soar and not seeing the faster takeover, that it’s not likely substantially more severe than omicron because we’re not seeing it in hospitalization rates,” Stoddard said. “Even in places where BA.2 has taken over more heavily, like in the Northeast, you’re not seeing hospitalization rates soaring there either.”

"I’ve lived in quite a few townhouses, and never experienced this. Even our brand new townhouse was soundproof, but that was in the 90s and it was a Ryland. I think everyone on here is correct; houses are being built faster and cheaper than ever before, and they are skinnier and more vertical than they used to be, so there is essentially more shared wallspace. Plus it seems like a certain builder builds most new homes in this area now, and I’ve only heard negative things from anyone who owns one of these homes. People keep buying them though, so I guess builders don’t care about producing a quality home like they used to. 

My parents had a similar issue with their new home, and my dad complained by writing letters to their corporate office and threatening a lawsuit, and the builder finally came out and corrected the issue. They were still under the 30 day warranty, though, and it was a small company, not a mega one like Ryan or Pulte. Still, you should check what your warranty covers and write to the builder listing your complaints ASAP, just so there is a record of your complaint.",t2_cx3671k5,LittleRooLuv,0,1648737860.0,0,t1_i2uq1ll,i2uq1ll,True,sunflowertech,t3_tsnrsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/MontgomeryCountyMD/comments/tsnrsi/just_moved_into_a_newly_built_townhouse_i_can/,"Just moved into a newly built townhouse, I can hear nextdoor.

"My guess is that inspectors are focusing more on the factors most likely to kill the occupants than on noise transference. I couldn't find county code reqs for new builds, but this sounds like how I'd imagine it happens in practice:

>While some community building inspection departments require field-testing to be conducted before a certificate of occupancy is issued, many, if not most, do not. They rely instead on the architect’s specification and acoustic design recommendation and the expectation that their specified designs will result in the minimum sound isolation construction between adjacent units. Unfortunately, what is specified by architectural sound design and what is subsequently built do not always coincide if proper attention and inspection oversight are not implemented.

"This is not in the purview of a homeowner’s insurance policy. This is an issue that needs to be found by a trade inspector, like a roofing company or a plumber that will help to find the source. If it is within your unit, like a pipe leak, you will be responsible for getting that fixed. Homeowners insurance will only come into play if you have a huge leak that floods your apartment and makes your unit unlivable. 

You need to work with the property management company to determine the source. If it is the roof, the property management is most likely responsible for repair of the roof and associated damage. Your condominium declarations/covenants will spell this out. 

[Here is an article I found on this. ](https://altitude.law/resources/newsletter/who-pays-for-what-in-a-condominium-water-leak-situation/)


Once the source is found, an assessment will need to be completed on what was damaged and what remediation steps need to be taken. If this is a relatively new, slow leak, it is likely that remediation may be minimal, even as simple as allowing the affected areas dry and painting.

OP: look into adding a layer of 5/8 drywall to the divider walls. They even make sound blocking drywall with a layer of acoustic damping sealant sandwiched in between.

The way you should handle it is through your vet, who may have some other puppies in the same situation, not just exposing random dog, not to mention the Home Depot or other stores aren't a play space.

And finally a couple weeks of not socializing isn't going to make a difference. I'm not sure where you're getting this tiny window idea from but it's completely wrong. Dogs continue learn forever, that's a fact, but the training needs to be done properly. Take the dog for walks and teach them commands to ""look at me"" and reward with a treat. Then when there are other dogs you have a treat and a command ready to use.

"Homeowners insurance is for paying to fix large problems, not for finding the source of issues. If the issue is small (and at this point you have no idea because you don’t know the cause of the issue) you are potentially wasting a claim on a small matter. Home insurance companies can be very quick to drop people who make a lot of claims (2-3 is considered a lot) so I would not call your insurance company on this again until you have hired a plumber or other company, found the source of the problem, and only then if the cost is in fact worth it to file a claim that could raise your rates.

I used to love Brew Belly’s cheese steaks. Now I Don’t care for Brew Belly as their food quality went down majorly since the opening. 
The place across the street that closed. Milk and Cheese hands down had the best steak and cheese. Their Philly egg rolls were amazing too. I didn’t know they were closing and apparently went there on the last couple of days. It’s a shame I didn’t try it before. I would of kept them in business myself. 😭😅

Continental Pizzas cheese steak is a joke. The amount of meat they put on it for you is one slice of the steakums from the frozen isle of a grocery store. You have to ask for extra meat, and even then it’s still a joke. If you like your subs on a diet be my guest and buy one from there. 

In Wheaton there is a food truck on the corner of Grandview Ave, and University Blvd East called Emilys. It’s at the Bank of America. Both their chicken cheese steak and regular steak and cheese are great! A large runs about $10 bucks and it’s filled with what you want. It gets loud in their truck with food cooking so speak a little loudly for then. They also have really good tacos for the price. It’s really worth the price, and the taste is great!

Also the condo association in Florida voted to have the repairs done and the board members literally lived in the building that collapsed, they had skin in the game and it really isn’t the same as government oversight.

"The Constitution gives the power of setting the rules of federal elections to the states. It also says Congress may override them, but, as the article states:

>It’s one thing for Congress to “make or alter” regulations for time, place and manner of elections. It’s arguably another for Congress to mandate that non-partisan commissions define the contours of the districts ... The court might decide there’s a distinction between requiring single-member districts and requiring a particular method of drawing them.  
>  
>It’s also easy to imagine the current Supreme Court holding that states have an inherent right to draw their own districts. States have had that power since the earliest days of the Constitution, and even before it — if you count the states’ power to choose representatives to Congress under the Articles of Confederation. This history could be used to claim that states cannot be divested of the power to draw districts as they see fit.  
>  
>The court might also worry about Congress claiming too much power over districting. Imagine a situation in which, instead of mandating non-partisan commissions, Congress takes over districting directly. That would amount to a radical change in how districts are set, transferring power to Congress and away from states.

"Not everyone pleased:

There are also plenty of other businesses along the two Bethesda streeteries benefiting from the temporary open space design.   
That isn't exactly the case at the Downtown Silver Spring streetery on Newell St. A Downtown Silver Spring resident, who asked not to be identified, said she's starting to reach her ""breaking point.""

""We haven’t been able to get answers. We’ve reached out to councilmembers, to the county executive, to the heads of the department of transportation, parks department. We don’t understand why it’s still closed,"" she said. ""I’ve actually spent time out here during the lockdowns. It started to become disruptive in terms of noise at all hours of the day, particularly when the weather’s warm and in the summertime. A lot of people either are retired or they work from home, and they’ll come out here and start drinking and blast music while you’re trying to have a Zoom call in your apartment. And then on the weekends, people would come, and they would grill and smoke right next to the building."" 

In the winter, FOX 5 saw some residents complain about a tent with a generator that was assembled at the streetery for use during the colder months. At least two workers were also tasked with monitoring the location.   
The Montgomery County Transportation Department Director told FOX 5 there is a working group of various agencies reviewing complaints at the Newell St. streetery. One option being discussed is whether moving the tables and other ""outdoor furniture"" away from the apartment building next to the streetery could help mitigate some of the issues there.
