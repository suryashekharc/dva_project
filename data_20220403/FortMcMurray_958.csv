"This is the advice I was given when I started out of high school and I didn’t take it. 
I just want those who are young and have minimal experience in this type of environment to know what they’re getting themselves into. It’s a lot of money and a ton of stress. When I dropped out at 20 I had gained 40 pounds and felt so incredibly low about myself.  
When I went to keyano we started out with about 70 students and less than 20 graduated.  Nursing is one of the hardest degrees to finish and not because of the content. Just want them going into it with their eyes wide open to what it’s like.

* *What can I expect to pay for rent?*

At the moment you're looking at around $950-$1000 starting for most apartments in the area. That being said, there's lots of people in town renting out basement suites and rooms, so if you check around kijiji and the like you may be able to find a good deal. 

* *How much do gym memberships cost?*

There's a fair number of gyms in the area now so I won't list them all off, but here are a few for reference: [Syncrude Sport and Wellness Centre](https://www.keyano.ca/en/athletics-and-fitness/memberships.aspx) [MacDonald Island Park](https://www.macdonaldisland.ca/memberships) and [Gym Nation](https://gymnationymm.com/)

* *Is food as expensive as people say?*

Depends on what you're shopping for. Food prices seem to be on the rise in general these days, but I wouldn't say cost is much worse here than it is elsewhere in Alberta (or at least I haven't noticed a significant change in my grocery bills since moving here). For reference, I average around $100-$200 and that's for a family of 4. 

* *Is anything within walking distance? Is it miserable there without a car?*

This is going to depend heavily on where you are in town. Where I live right now I can walk to work, grocery stores, businesses and what have you. The neighborhood I used to live in though suffered from the suburban housing effect where you have a lot of residences and not much else, so if you needed anything you were most likely going to need a car if you wanted to get anything done. That being said, we do have a bus system if you need public transit.

* *Roommates or no roommates*

Getting a roommate would certainly help with costs. If you can find someone you can tolerate being in the same building with, I'd say go for it. Like with anything else though its probably a good idea to talk in depth with any potential roomies to work out expectations and make sure they're a good fit. 

* *Is biking doable in the summer?*

Most definitely, you can find lots of people cycling around neighborhoods or trails during the summer. You're probably not going to be able to cross town in one, but you can get around most areas just fine on a 10-speed. Used ones can be found on various buy & sell groups, or you could probably find one used at one of the sport shops in town. Bike thefts are pretty uncommon overall, but it'd be good sense to get some protection for your wheels regardless. 

* *Internet?*

Speeds aren't going to knock your socks off, but its not terrible either. Recent speed test I ran had upload/download at 174/106 with 14 ping. YMMV depending on your provider and plan. 

* *Snow?*

Usually starts around the start of November and keeps on until early April.

* *Food bank?*

In order to build hospitals you will need staff. The small percentage of hcw who were fired because they were unvaccinated would not be enough to run a Covid hospital. Despite both vaccinated and unvaccinated catching Covid it is the unvaccinated that are requiring the most care and filling up the ICU.  It takes 3-4 years of school to become a nurse and then approximately 6 months training to be an ICU nurse. You also have to find nurses who actually want to be in that environment. As a healthcare worker we are required to keep out vaccines up to date so I honestly do not understand why being vaccinated against Covid has been an issue for a few.,t2_i6pphzm3,Brigittepierette,0,1643613663.0,0,t1_huytb62,huytb62,False,[deleted],t3_sfqt5a,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/sfqt5a/woke_up_to_the_convoy_and_couldnt_be_prouder_some/,Woke up to the convoy and couldn't be prouder!

"Firstly I'll start with saying. I'm sorry these things have happened to you as it seems something very significant has happened in your life.

Secondly there seems to be more going on that I don't know the full details of since they pertain to your personal life so I won't be touching on that. 

What I will touch on is Tax. We all pay tax. I pay tax. Anyone reading this pays tax.. yes, it is jarring that when I get paid they take 30% of income tax. But how we react to this is completely different for everyone and how we understand it come differently also. But because we view it differently doesn't mean I will not defend you in other matters. 

Now I have a feeling you're one to say the media cannot be trusted and from what I've seen is ""taxing the unvaccinated"" is media driven. 
I have not seen REAL sources saying the unvaccinated will be taxed. Quebec has given murmurs that will might do it but it has not happened. If it has already happened  where the unvaccinated have been taxed in Canada please correct me with credible sources. 

Its a shame you feel I wouldn't fight for you. If ever it does get to the Extremes you're talking about such as encampment for not having a vaccination like the encampment happening in China of the Uyghurs.

"If we weren't oppressed then I'd be able to keep my tax money since I'm unvaccinated and not allowed to be part of society anymore. I've already had my career and previous lifestyle ripped away from me because of people like you who hate seeing people stand up for freedom.

I'd be able to own land and a house that I've already paid for but instead, I have it taken away from me if I refuse to pay land tax.... LAND TAX! This come after already being taxed just for existing and being a productive member of society by working.. called income tax. Then every single item you buy gets taxed... and when the people creating these items buy the materials to build it in the first place they get taxed.... then if you have a family and want to pass on what you've acquired throughout your lifetime of being taxed on literally everything imaginable in day to day life, you get taxed for passing things onto your children..

Now they want to tax the unvaccinated, and I bet people like you don't even have a problem with it, because you were too afraid to say no to public opinion when they said you should put substances in your body when they aren't even legally held liable if something happens to you from it.

Now tell me again how we are free and I have no idea what it means to be oppressed as things keep slowly getting worse and worse and the narrative keeps changing.

Soon it won't even seem out of the realm of probability people like me will be put in a camp for staying unvaccinated, and you'll be here on reddit pretending like you weren't one of the ones preaching to my people that it's only gonna be 1 vaccine and everything will go back to normal if ""we'd just listen"". You'll support my confinement and never think about this discussion of oppression again, because when you start to realize that the things you considered to be conspiracies are coming true, the only people you'll have left to depend on are the foolish cowards like yourself who are too afraid to say no when a gun is pointed at your head, and your people won't stand chance.

"Luckily I came from Yellowknife NorthWest Territories, so imagine if Fort Mac only had 19.5k or population and it's about another 13 hours drive straight North with nothing in between except Peace River Alberta and Grand Prarie lol.

Up there winter ends at the beginning of June.... winter starts the day September hits. Snow starts to stay on the ground every year on Halloween day exactly and by then the lakes are already starting to get safe to walk on.

Needless to say, I am looking VERY forward to winter ending here in like...what the end of March? Spring and Fall last longer than 2 weeks?! Oh yeah... I'm sooooo ready for summer here!

Looking forward to checking out the lakes and learning to cook outside with cast iron and a camp fire with the fish that I catch.

"So I moved here at the end of October because my previous job in Yellowknife NorthWest Territories got rid of anybody who was unvaccinated. 

I thought I was going to end up on Vancouver Island where I have family, but I put out some resume's in the mining industry and got a call back immediately. I was home sick when I first got here for the first few months, and caught covid over Christmas, but since recovering, I've actually been in a really positive mental space about this place.

It's helps that I came from somewhere that you could consider worse than Fort McMurray yet still being similar. The winters won't scare me off, as I come from a harsher environment. While people say shopping is non existent up here, I find it has 3x more than where I come from if not more.

This place, like many places in the North has a stronger sense of community than places to the south. We're all stuck up here freezing our asses off, and most people up here have goals to eventually retire back to where they came from, so everybody has at least that in common.

The nice thing about this city/town is that there is work for anybody who has their head on their shoulders (showing up to work on time and not blowing shifts). The money is there to be made, and if you live in town you don't have to live in a camp, and they'll pay you ""LOA"" to live up here.

I'm telling you, the incentive is here to work and you feel like you actually stand a chance at acquiring some form of your dream of retiring. I am very thankful for Fort McMurray and the opportunity it's given me, an uneducated and unvaccinated person who wasn't able to save much money in his 20s.

Now I'm ready to choose an apartment today, and thanks to the oil sands, I am able to afford somewhere with a beautiful kitchen and a place I don't feel like I am ""settling"" or compromising for, and I am still going to be able to put quite a respectable amount of money aside for retirement.

If you aren't financially in a great spot, there are cheaper places to rent in this town. Yes real estate and rent is high compared other towns around the same size, but that's what living anywhere half desirable in the North is going to pack along with it.

If you aren't moving here for the financial opportunities, then I would assume you have a strong attraction to living in harsh winter climates and appreciate remoteness.

I am not a fan of extreme winter but I am already used to it, and I am looking very forward to experiencing spring and fall for longer than 2 weeks before they're over. I bet summer up here isn't so bad, I am interested in visiting the lakes and going fishing :)

Anyway, I guess my rant is over, I just wanted to share my personal experience so far of being here just shy of 3 months, I think life is what you make it. If you're a city slicker who bases their life off of concerts and huge events, and you don't have the financial position or a job that allows you to work hard/play hard, chances are you won't love it up here. If you enjoy putting yourself outside and finding things about nature that you like, maybe you could learn to appreciate a place like this.",t2_11rw86,EskimoCheeks,0,1642092262.0,0,t1_hsi7lcv,hsi7lcv,True,MFondue,t3_pprete,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/pprete/whats_it_like_living_in_fort_mcmurray/,What's it like living in Fort McMurray?,/r/FortMcMurray/comments/pprete/whats_it_like_living_in_fort_mcmurray/hsi7lcv/,2,r/FortMcMurray,0,2

"If you ain't used to -30 I suggest a sweater and winter coat. Careful of keeping your face exposed especially when it starts dipping close to -40 although we probably won't see either in December 

If you're driving I highly suggest a car with winters. Fort McMurray don't like to plow or sand their roads and they have the most shameful plowing ive ever seen in a city. Many locals will fight me over this but I've lived in quite a few different cities and towns. Fort McMurrays the worst for snow clearing hands down. 

As for things to do in winter that I couldn't help you with, I have a hard enough time finding anything to do during the summer here. If you don't like hiking you're kindve shit out of luck. 

Fort Mac isn't exactly the town of choice for tourists. It's a working town and not much more than that. (which sucks because this place do have quite a bit of potential)

Been living here 5 years now and the thing that's going to run me out is the lack of retail stores and winter in general. Cost of living isn't worth it to me anymore.

There isn't really any places to explore around here as it's either residential lots, or business parks. No cool places to drive which is a bummer for me because I love driving. Perhaps you could visit Fort McKay if they don't have the gates locked down as it is a beautiful spot

I questioned why OP was worried about kids specifically when we need to worry about everyone equally and if you're gonna cherry pick groups I would start with the ones with the most deaths, and that's a big if, I'm not saying do that but OP did cherry pick that age group.

Ya I looked up quickly and posted anything just to get a ball rolling on some numbers of anything versus us just saying random facts with no bearing on them, I wasn't preaching that link like the gospel.

Ya I questioned your credibility, am I not allowed to?  I have no idea who you are or where you you learned such things.

Yes I read the whole article.  The article didn't go against anything I've been getting at.  In the same article US crossed 700,000 deaths, 520 of them children.  I saw you liked to throw out that 840,000 children contracting number out there.  Well if 699,480 non children died of covid, I wonder what the drastically high number of that same group just contracting it is.

I really don't understand you getting all pissed off and saying fuck you to me, like chill out bud.  You're like confusing me just speaking numbers and logic to thinking that means I don't care about children dying or something, like what the hell.",t2_14iud4,YellowBlackBrown,0,1637217893.0,0,t1_hl3c4xq,hl3c4xq,False,Canuckistanni,t3_qwac6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/qwac6s/this_is_never_going_to_stop/,This is never going to stop,/r/FortMcMurray/comments/qwac6s/this_is_never_going_to_stop/hl3c4xq/,1,r/FortMcMurray,0,1
"What I'm trying to show is your argument is the most typical unempathetic argument out there. 

You begin by questioning why the OP would be worried about children in regards to COVID when its seniors who succumb to the virus in comparison. 

Then you begin to post links from a year ago from news outlets that have no credibility to support your narrative. 
Then you begin to question my credibility.

So I posted an article (which I baited you to read) from one of the #1 most reliable news outlets.  You then decided to reject everything in that article except those numbers that support your narrative.
I'm trying to show you that no matter what you read you'll always look for ANYTHING to support your claim. 

Listen no matter what I say you'll never trust it... 
So what I'm trying to say... Is yes.. fuck you.
For trying to create the argument around should people care about kids if only less than 1% are hospitalized. 

Here's what you left out from that article.. cause it didn't fit your argument..

""Her son is one of more than 840,000 children under the age of four to contract COVID-19 in the United States since the beginning of the pandemic""

"Ok I didn't ask about ""succumbing"" to the virus but just more susceptible to getting it but I'll take that tid bit and run with it for you. 

Yes, it's shown that Seniors are more susceptible to succumbing to the virus when this all began. 
Children were thought to be ""safe"" in the general terms of things. 

But I asked who's more susceptible... That would be seniors and children. Children have a knack of carrying this virus and spreading it (not their fault), 
Especially when it came to school. Schools were shut down and sent online for ... How long? Half a year? 
That's a long time for a school year to go online.. that's a lot of parents who had to stay home. Not to mention domestic violence went up by 75% during those times.... And don't think people just beat their spouses. Maybe that school was a safe place for that kid or only place they could get food or away from an abusive/neglectful household. 

So it's not just... Think of the children getting the virus and dying when you don't wear that mask and risk them getting it and spreading it.... Think of the whole picture.

"When we're a bit further into winter, ice skating.  The outdoor rinks are free.  I'm hoping Miskanaw opens their pond for skating again this year and WinterPlay usually sets up some skating rinks on the Snye.  Lions Park has opened a skating trail the last few years.  MacDonald Island Park has the indoor leisure ice, but there's a small fee to use it and I'm not sure what it's hour are.  For now you could go for a walk on some of the trails and then maybe get coffee/hot chocolate after to warm up.  I don't know if Vista Ridge is open for winter yet since we only just had our first snow the other day, but it has a tubing park and they take you back up the hill in a sleigh and I think it would be similar in price to going to a movie and getting snacks.

"It's a very small place, about 80k in the town itself. Compared to Toronto you'll probably have an easier and maybe even shorter commute (if you're going to site. If you work in town the commute is nothing). You're close to nature anywhere you go. You'll probably be disappointed in all the restaurants lol. We have everything that we need here in town including some nice independent small businesses but if you want variety on par with places like Ottawa or Winnipeg,  you'll be looking for a trip down to Edmonton for a weekend. The best way to enjoy Fort McMurray long-term is to become outdoorsy lol. Take advantage of the huge trail network, the rivers and lakes. We have groomed trails for cross country skiing and snowmobiling in the winter too. Compared to other towns of this size, we do have a lot of recreation options, but only one pool. It's not a walkable place like Toronto where you can stroll down streets and shop at the stores, though it's a big priority for our City Council to make the downtown area more like that.

"It is definitely a lot smaller than those cities as the population is about 80k. Are you moving or just working a certain period of time? I'm a cis female and moved here from Vancouver in 2012. There are a ton of newer amenities for a city its size and great outdoor spaces to explore. The biggest difference I think you'll find is there isn't any street to walk down and get a coffee and browse stores/eat/etc... everything is disjointed and spread out partly from the breakneck expansion of the city, and partly because our fire, flood, and now covid have painfully gutted our brick & mortar retail business sector. However, there are a ton of amazing home/grassroots business' always on the peripheral you just have to know who/where they are.

There are great bars, super fun social scene when we're allowed, a couple great gyms, lots of cannabis and liquor stores and tons of hotels, decent restaurants. Road/traffic wise everything is kind of in a loop everywhere you drive, so you never really get lost and it's also maddening if you're in a rush as you can't really cut through a lot of places. But the plus is there's basically no traffic compared to TO although if you're working out at site you can get in a jam here & there. I hope you enjoy your experience, I absolutely love living here, the community is effing amazing!!!

"Good day. Well I moved here in May of 2012. I heard all the same things that you’re hearing. So before I even had a chance to find out for my self. I heard negative things. Things like there’s nothing to do, way to many drugs, lots of crime etc. Well with those things being said I thought hmmm I come from ritual NB and those things are running rampant there as well. So it’s not a Fort McMurray issue it’s a world wide issue. Now let me give a few of my selling points. And some of what I will mention was before the pandemic which who knows what any place is going to be any time soon. 

Personally I LOVE it here. And when I knew that this was in fact home for me was when I was back east during evacuation of the 2016 wild fire that swept threw town. And when it started opening back up and the part of town I lived in we received our time table. I said to my family I can’t wait to go home. And that’s what this place has become to me.

As far as a affordable, I had this conversation last month when I was back in NB for a visit with family. My sisters son was looking for work in Fredericton and she said how expensive it was. Then she said to me but it’s still cheaper then where you live. I said well let’s compare apples to apples. Once we did that and I am in walking distance to move theatre, several places to eat, dentist, and lots of other amenities. I pay less per month then what he was looking at in NB with nothing in walking distance. Now mind you I don’t walk to those often but used it as a measuring stick. And tried to find buildings in comparison. I can live other parts of town that’s not near as nice for 400-600 a month cheaper then I do now.

So when I hear people say the famous ole “ there’s NOTHING  to do” I always start off by asking them:
What is it that you did where you come from that you can’t do here? 
Of course there’s things that you can’t but over all I ask them…
Have you been to Keyano Theatre  for any of the plays, concerts, comedy or even film festival movie nights?
Most people don’t even know that’s a thing here. And I have seen some great shows, concerts and more.

Mac Island is a great place as far as rock climbing, water slides, pool, golfing etc depends on your kids ages. 
There’s a golf course out at Vista Ridge as well as a climbing park with it being built 3 storey high, zip line across to the next phase etc the golf course is fun for families and the holes are bigger then your standard. It’s a great place to get started and have fun learning the game. I never golfed until this summer and I’ve been out 3 times. Because it’s such a laid back difference in contrast to what most places are.

There’s bowling and laser tag down town. Haven’t been to the laser tag it just opened. But bowling is good. If you wanna go out with friends and bowl the one up town is more geared to that. But during the day until 8 at night I believe the bowling at Banquet is open for  families. 

There is a dirt bike race track just south of town and a car race track that is just getting its legs under it this year. In fact there’s two days of racing this weekend.

** sorry as I just scrolled up I see you said your child is 1.5 so a bit young yet for some of this stuff** 


It is much more family friendly. I have friends with younger kids and they have told me there’s lots of programs and things for kids. They say how much it has changed and is changing to be more family friendly.

The condo I live in has its own park, it also has its own gym, carwash, game room with pool table & air hockey. As well as a short walk to some really great trails. 

I have my favourite go to places to eat depending on what I am craving. 

There’s more to list and talk about but I will cut it off now lol

I hope this has been helpful and any questions to feel free to ask.

"I lived in Fort McMurray 1999 to 2002 (graduated in 2000), and returned for summers and holidays for a few years later until moving out East. My parents and extended family are largely still in the Mac. Your summary of the city really felt like an echo of that past life. Coming up in a time when the city was booming and it was filled with transient workers, more ready access to drugs. Although I only felt unsafe in parts of downtown, never in the burbs.

Strange to think that time was 20 years ago, and not 5 years ago (like it feels).

edit: for OP, I would say that the Mac is quite safe for families, has more of a ""community"" feel to it, than any big Canadian city. A scary street in the Mac has nothing on a less than safe feeling street in Edmonton.",t2_95uqt,rhinonyssus,0,1631882384.0,0,t1_hd784c9,hd784c9,False,MFondue,t3_pprete,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/pprete/whats_it_like_living_in_fort_mcmurray/,What's it like living in Fort McMurray?,/r/FortMcMurray/comments/pprete/whats_it_like_living_in_fort_mcmurray/hd784c9/,8,r/FortMcMurray,0,8

"Living here is like riding a bike. Except the bike is on fire. And you're on fire. And everything is on fire. And you're in hell.

Seriously though, the city has developed a greater sense of community since the down-turn, fire, flood, plague and whatnot. Housing is much more affordable, property taxes are low and city services are spectacular (be sure to check out Mac Island, the waterfront, community parks and trails, etc.) If you can handle slightly limited shopping, dining and entertainment - and especially if you love outdoor recreation - you'll likely be very comfortable here.

Fort McMurray still has real problems with substance abuse and homelessness. Violent crime definitely still occurs, but the general sense is that the city is much safer now. I personally live downtown and have never feared for my safety, but then I'm also a white male. The city was a rougher place back when the mines hired more transient workers - the stereotypical roid-head douchebag roughneck with no roots in the area, but a lot of those guys left with the layoffs.

Demographically it's a very young and diverse community. You'll see fewer seniors but more kids and minorities. You pay more for everything from groceries to oil changes here - particularly professional services like accountants or mechanics, but I honestly doubt you're in for many big financial surprises.

  It will be tough to get onto an oil sands site but Suncor does have a family day every year (sans covid). If you find someone willing to sign you up next summer that would be good.  

For Six Lakes (back country camping with nice beaches), you can either rent a quad/trailer and drive yourself in  3 to 5 hours or you could try the Six Lakes or Richardson Back Country Facebook pages and see if someone will let you tag along.

"Welcome to Fort McMurray! 

Other commenters have covered your Mac Island questions but also note that Syncrude Sport & Wellness Centre at Keyano College is also downtown and has a pretty good fitness centre with some other amenities and is a bit cheaper, though there's no pool.

There's a ton of winter activities to do here, it's my favourite season despite having to plug in your vehicle all the time, lol. The RMWB maintains a boarded, lit outdoor rink in pretty much every neighbourhood in town and last winter there were 2 skating trails built in a park and at the Mac Island golf course. 

The lakes and rivers (except for the Athabasca, it can be very dangerous) freeze over so lots of people ice fish at Gregoire Lake and Engstrom Lake south of town on Highway 881 or hike up the frozen Clearwater or Hangingstone Rivers. If you have a snowmobile or want to get one, the SnoDrifters club maintains a ton of trails on Stony Mountain and out into the bush.

You might not know this but you can often see the northern lights here from late August to April, so lots of people are into photography to take northern lights photos - there's a group on Facebook with people's photos taken here and some of them are absolutely incredible. 

Final thing I'll mention unrelated to winter that people don't think about before they come here is the live music scene - pre-covid of course, lots of pubs have live music on weekends and people here like to drink and dance and have a good time, haha.

"Lots of areas in town are pet friendly with trails for walking pets. Off leash park in Thickwood is nice. Dickinsfield is a nice area being close to the Birchwood trails for walking dogs. Really,  most areas uptown are pet friendly. Downtown maybe not quite as much.

"Don't listen to the haters. Fort McMurray has lots of things to do. Only thing you effectively *can't* do here is go to a big mall. Otherwise, you just need to put yourself out there to find like minded people that want to do the same things as you!

Mac Island has great facilities and there are local groups for many sports. I would suggest going hunting on Facebook groups or Kijiji. Somebody should be able to point you in the right direction (group sports are not really my thing so I don't know any off hand). 

The Fort McMurray Fish and Game Association has good archery and firearm facilities. Lots of likeminded people there. 

There is a very active Cross Country skiing group in town that grooms the Birchwood Trails each year. Vista Ridge has other outdoor winter activities for skiing, snowboarding, etc. 

We have great local golf courses and there are usually events in some form scheduled there. Rotarylinks is out by the airport and is a great new course. 

We have great locations for kayaking and canoeing. Lots of good trails for hiking or cycling (both downtown by the Snye and up in Thickwood).

FMAH is actually located in the McKenzie Industrial Park right now — they haven’t moved back downtown since the flood.  I’ve taken my cats there for several years and have always had a pretty good experience.  But I haven’t been in since covid hit (haven’t had any concerns so figured it was best to avoid because they weren’t allowing people to go in with their pets and I don’t think my girl would be okay with that).

"Northern Veterinary Services is the newer vet in Gregoire.   We had been seeing the WBSAH for our cats up until April when we had an emergency and Northern was the vet on call at the time.  The vets at Northern were fantastic - on top of the emergency visit, they also diagnosed our eldest with feline asthma when WBSAH hadn't after two prior visits.  The emergency visit revealed a chronic illness with our eldest case and we wanted to stick with them going forward.  I don't want to bash WBSAH - our experience with WBSAH was good in the past, but recently they don't seem to be able to offer the same quality of care and seem overly busy/understaffed.  Hopefully they can change that in the future.  

As for timing - most of the vets are overbooked.  Northern books appointments at least a month out.  Our experience with WBSAH has been similar, but they do offer the first-come first-serve same-day appointments for cases for those seeking urgent, but not emergent care and they don't cost quite as much as emergency appointments.  I don't think Northern offers those types of appointment and I'm not sure if the other vets do either.",t2_16fnx5,SneakyLinux,0,1628465629.0,0,t1_h88557e,h88557e,True,[deleted],t3_p0oeqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/p0oeqh/vet_questionsrecommendations_in_town/,Vet questions/recommendations in town,/r/FortMcMurray/comments/p0oeqh/vet_questionsrecommendations_in_town/h88557e/,3,r/FortMcMurray,0,3

I was evacuated, and ended up at the old Mildred Lake live-on-location camp rooms, due to my mum being an employee of Syncrude. Myself, my toddler, my black lab and my mother were stuck at this location  for 3 days, before they could move us onto busses and airplanes.

Not once did I think about grabbing food that I could use to sustain everyone for more than a few hours, let alone what turned out to be literal days in a unused work-camp facility.

"Personnaly, If you are here for a few years only I would rent a place. I think most of the risk of a major house price decrease is over but why risk being underwater on a house when you want to leave? I know alot of people in that scenario. And the odds of the house prices booming like before are pretty low. 
 What if one of the mines shits down for some reason? It will hurt demand for housing big time and you will have trouble getting rid of your place at the same time as employment opportunities dry up. 

  If you are willing to rent an apartment there are a few decent ones available for quite  cheap. Cheaper then you will ever live in a house.   I know someone who rented a 3 bedroom with all utilities, cable, and internet for 1450 a month. New building as well.   

If you are looking to rent a house then it starts to make sense to buy in my opinion. May or may not  be more expensive on a cash flow basis to buy an equivalent house but you will get full use of the property and the equity in the house. 


Don't buy a house over 700k, they are tougher to sell. 
And the houses under 450k are probably fine but I found almost all of them would need big renovations. 
Exception is duplexes, you can sometimes find decent new ones for under 400k.

"Right now properties are quite cheap compared to what they used to be. Lots of rebuild houses for sale right now in the fire affected areas. Keep in mind property values are still dropping, but not as drastically as they did when the industry took a hit years ago. Quite a few people are taking large hits for houses they bought around 2012. My husband and I recently bought a rebuild home for under $600K in a newer neighborhood in town. Even if property values don’t drastically improve (although I believe they may 5 years out), we believe we can at least sell for the price we bought at. 

So far on the rental market, I’ve seen some drastically high rental units (assuming you’re looking at renting an entire house). Usually ranging from $2400-$3500 with utilities not always included in that price - which seems insanely high to me personally, at least the $3500 ones. Mortgage rates are low right now, so if you did buy you could be laying well below the rent prices for homes up here depending on what type/size of house you’re looking for.",t2_3jcbpraf,beachypeachygal,0,1625762696.0,0,t1_h4hotna,h4hotna,True,xhunco,t3_og9ql1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/og9ql1/real_estate_value/,Real estate value,/r/FortMcMurray/comments/og9ql1/real_estate_value/h4hotna/,1,r/FortMcMurray,0,1

This is great advice. I don’t have many sentimental items and even those I can certainly live without. I have them all packed up now and set aside. I’ll make a list of things that I’d also like to take but only if I have room and time. No threat whatsoever at this time but a lightening strike could change that pretty quickly.

"1. Keep a couple of FRESH gas cans in storage. 3 months after you filled them, dump them into your car and refill them.
2. A 24-48 case of water. Like the gas, no more than a couple of months old.
3. Take photos of every part of your house/apartment and store the photos in a secure location. (Icloud/google photos)
4. Scan your critical docs and put them on 2 SD cards. One gets put in your ""go bag"" and the other goes into a safe deposit box.
5. NOTHING and I fucking mean NOTHING in your house is worth your life. I'm including pets.
6. A close but seemingly unable to reach you fire is the time you prep.
7. Plan for how to get out and how to get out if that doesn't work.
8. Calm people survive. That doesn't mean you can't be scared - just don't let fear take the wheel.
9. Chargers/cables - have some in the car already. Don't be fuckin around with that at the time. Worst case every gas station on the planet has those.
10. The second you are evact'ed - call the nearest safe area hotels and make a reservation.
11. A lot of other drivers are going to be stressed to the max, yield and retreat.
12. If you think it is likely, consider taking the day off work to prep.
13. Expect your phone will not work. A battery powered radio is worth the effort.
14. Turn off the AC/Furnace. It'll cut down the smoke in the house.",t2_3gx4j,betelgeux,0,1625271974.0,0,t1_h3vc0hj,h3vc0hj,True,carlsberg13,t3_obxqf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/obxqf2/forest_fire_evacuation_advice/,Forest fire evacuation advice,/r/FortMcMurray/comments/obxqf2/forest_fire_evacuation_advice/h3vc0hj/,1,r/FortMcMurray,0,1
"my time has come! i was incredibly prepared and packed basically everything we could need keep in mind i do tend to overpack so not everything may be necessary but i was always taught its better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it

firstly lets cover what you need to do before leaving your home (based on what i did)

the first thing which I would do well before any possibility of a fire is keep a spreadsheet of your valuables including brand, place purchased, price, specific model, and any other important details, if the value has increased include that too and if it's no longer available but has other similar ones keep a list of those too and photos if possible, keep a list of all of the food in your house and save receipts, i don't know for all insurance companies but ours paid to replace the food in our fridge, deep freeze, and mini-fridgealso try to have a plan of what you would like to do once evacuated keep a list of hotels and prices or campsites or people you can stay with, and try to decide if you would like to come back at all

i cannot stress this one enough have recent photos of your pets, have them microchipped and up to date on vaccines and registered with the city, for any animals requiring specialized care (ie. dogs and cats on medication or any exotic animals) keep multiple papers listing their needs and have 1 in a binder with your other stuff 1 attached to their cage or somewhere near where they would be if you are unable to retrieve them or bring them with you also if you feel safe doing it before you go leave a house key somewhere outside hidden if you need someone to go rescue your animal it'll make their job a lot easier also try to find somewhere compiling resources about lost pets

find your insurance papers and bring them with you as well as any copies of important documents (if you have the ashes of a loved one bring the papers that show they are ashes just in case as I don't know if they can be replaced or not) (also ideally have them in a safe binder or folder prior to evacuationclose your windows!!!! ash and smoke damage can ruin items and put pets that were unable to be retrieved in danger!

I cannot stress this one enough have recent photos of your pets, have them microchipped and up to date on vaccines and registered with the city, for any animals requiring specialized care (ie. dogs and cats on medication or any exotic animals) keep multiple papers listing their needs and have 1 in a binder with your other stuff 1 attached to their cage or somewhere near where they would be if you are unable to retrieve them or bring them with you also if you feel safe doing it before you go leave a house key somewhere outside hidden if you need someone to go rescue your animal it'll make their job a lot easier also try to find somewhere compiling resources about lost pets  you would like to come back at all  all

also STOP PANICKING take 10 seconds shake off the panic and breathe panicking doesn't help anyone put the stress and worry into action i know it sounds hard but you will have time to panic and go through your emotions once you are out and safe

this sounds stupid but facebook and twitter can be really good for information (depending on what you're looking for and if you can verify its real) alberta wildfire is only updated so often its also good for finding a safe place to stay or checking on friends

remember we have one road in and one road out if you are able to go south our neighbours went north because they heard they were setting up places for evacuees there and had to be flown out to edmonton

also STOP PANICKING take 10 seconds shake off the panic and breathe panicking doesn't help anyone put the stress and worry into action I know it sounds hard but you will have time to panic and go through your emotions once you are out and safe

as for actual packing lists(also of course this varies depending on what transport you have and how much you are able to take) also pack for way longer than you are told if you are able to our last 2 evacuations were way longer than they said they would be and when we returned we still had to use some stuff from our kits

water

change of clothes (and extra socks and underwear)

chargers

external batteries

full tank of gas

external harddrive or with extra copy of information

medications

binder of important documents

toothbrush toothpaste floss and mouthwash

shampoo and conditioner and any hair treatments you use regularly

body wash

any skincare products you use

q tips

first aid kits

hair brush, scrunchies, if you use one a bonnet

extra pet supplies

flashlight

nonperishable food

hand sanitizer

masks

trash bags

cash

rain poncho

blankets

can opener

stuff to keep you busy and keep your mind off of it

any sentimental items or family photos

also once you're out try to connect with people from the city being alone watching the tv constantly will destroy your mental health

if you don't feel safe meeting with people because of covid or you want to do something other than watch news but want to feel productive see if anyone needs help distributing items or keeping a list of pets that need to be found or something

EDIT: The second you get back if your insurance adjuster isn't there record you walking through the house DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING you'll be able to check on things without messing up your insurance payout also be patient with the adjuster it will be stressful but they also are overwhelmed with people just like you kindness goes a very long way in getting better service because hey who would wanna put the extra effort in for someone who treats them like trash",t2_dkysfm9,CrystallizedCrotch,0,1625271003.0,0,t1_h3va9jj,h3va9jj,True,carlsberg13,t3_obxqf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/FortMcMurray/comments/obxqf2/forest_fire_evacuation_advice/,Forest fire evacuation advice,/r/FortMcMurray/comments/obxqf2/forest_fire_evacuation_advice/h3va9jj/,2,r/FortMcMurray,0,2

I can unlock my door from my phone and see through my ring cameras if someone needs in. If not, it's just one extra thing for insurance to fix.
