"There are new apartments along i-45 on the north side, as well as asking 105 heading west to lake Conroe today would be fine and most of those are new. Almost everything in that quarter including some on 336 on the NW side would be good in that price range. The areas up avoid are anything in the box E of main St, S of 105, N of Silverdale, and W of 1314 - an area called Duggan which is the low income area.

Some people would live in the woodlands for that price range and there are better amenities, recreation, shopping, and dining there but longer commute due to i-45 traffic in the afternoons.

Alternatively, you may be able to rent a house in parts of Conroe or in Willis for that price range. A Willis commute may not be bad as traffic is usually at least moving during peak hours in that direction but there's less to do outside of work, except it is closer to outdoor recreation options.",t2_q4c31,MC_L,0,1648367623.0,0,t1_i2agwq6,i2agwq6,False,Successful-Data3390,t3_tp6pph,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conroe/comments/tp6pph/relocating_any_areas_i_should_avoid/,Relocating.

"No, just out of this area.  It was nice when we moved in 14 years ago, and it‚Äôs been nice having the H-E-B come in that is off 242.  But traffic has gotten worse, and will continue to get worse as more people move over here.   The widening of 242 doesn‚Äôt really help much if you‚Äôre heading east towards 45 as the traffic lights only create more congestion with the influx of people.   Getting from 242 and 1314 to 45, use to take 10-15 mins 10 years ago, it now takes 30-45 minutes for that same drive.    Our neighborhood off 242 has never flooded since I‚Äôve live here, but as time has gone by I‚Äôve seen more and more water in the roads, ditches and such. And with both of these massive master planned communities not doing anything to actually mitigate flooding, it doesn‚Äôt Bode well.

"I grew up around there, a just a bit north of it and my mom still lives out there. It's kind of like you said - no street lights and dark country roads and not shit to do if you're wanting to leave the house. That said, you're not but 20 minutes from Conroe, 15 or so from New Caney, and 20-30 from The Woodlands, so it's not really that bad. You get used to driving on the roads, just don't speed at night because you're liable to run someone over or hit a deer. Wildlife, you're looking at possums and deer and the occasional small wild hog but nothing really dangerous (I mean, do not approach a wild hog or a deer because they will definitely fuck you up). And snakes, definitely snakes, so maybe get an outside cat or just be prepared that this is a fact of life living out here. 

As for housing, I'm sure over the next 20 years it's going to blow up as the Conroe area continues to explode and housing prices continue to skyrocket. As for prices, you're probably not going to be ""investing"" at less than $250-350k even out there. You can definitely get a trailer or a double-wide on some property for way less than that, but I'm not seeing any new construction with decent square footage for under $250k. For some context, I just sold my 18 year-old 1600 sq ft home in North Conroe for $260k, so you can see how prices are a bit cheaper out there but still approaching what you'll find in a more premium area.",t2_4lau9,KerooSeta,0,1643899907.0,0,t1_hvfbzoz,hvfbzoz,True,Cherry2015,t3_sjabdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conroe/comments/sjabdd/grangerland/,Grangerland?,/r/Conroe/comments/sjabdd/grangerland/hvfbzoz/,1,r/Conroe,0,1
"Sounds about right as far as neighborhoods out here go.  I have been out here 15 years.  We have our share of petty crime but I have never felt unsafe anywhere and I run all over the place in the dark (all of the neighborhoods mentioned and then some).  Mostly meth heads coming onto properties and looking for easy things to walk off with.  There will be guns going off randomly but they are just target shooting.   To my knowledge, violent crime here is almost nonexistent outside of domestic disputes.  The biggest downside IMO is with these dark highways, people will walk/bike down them in the pitch black without lights or reflectors and my wife and I have very nearly hit people several times just driving down the road.   Depending on your budget though I would more recommend the Northcrest areas as they are very nice and well maintained throughout.  I run there quite frequently at 5 am without issues.  Outside of the mentioned neighborhoods it can be hit or miss since there aren't really zoning restrictions out here.  You can live in a nice house on 3 acres and be next to a burned out trailer or a huge mobile home repair business or a construction company or whatever.  Worked out in my favor as the house I have on the land we own would be multimillions in The Woodlands (I am not a rich man) for much much less so if you keep an open mind about your neighbors there are still great deals to be had.  CISD schools out here are pretty decent (my wife has worked at 2 including now the new one in Granger Pines) and I LOVE that my kids are exposed to all income brackets and many different cultures.  We only go to The Woodlands when we have to or on the weekend as the area from San Jac bridge to 45 is a nightmare to commute to/from.  No real public infrastructure other than the roads.  I also like that we are 40 min from downtown down 59 and can get to several areas in Houston fairly easily as long as we avoid 45 at peak times.  PM if you want any more details, I know the area very well and my wife's extended family has lived here since the 50's.",t2_pg1hv,stillfluffyafterall,0,1643896261.0,0,t1_hvf3lgs,hvf3lgs,False,Cherry2015,t3_sjabdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conroe/comments/sjabdd/grangerland/,Grangerland?,/r/Conroe/comments/sjabdd/grangerland/hvf3lgs/,3,r/Conroe,0,3
"There's a few big, and seemingly nice, neighborhoods in and around Grangerland. Artavia on 242 seems nice. They're also working on a brand new neighborhood at 1314 and 242 called Mavera but that's a ways off from coming to fruition. In Grangerland there's a new neighborhood called Granger Pines and it also seems decent to me. I'd say those would be your best options bc everything else is pretty meh. Whispering Pines is just down the road from Grangerland too and it's also a decent neighborhood, just older.

"Hey everyone, I just wanted to publicly apologize for not labeling last week's FTT as a ""Christmas Edition"" in the same way I did for the Halloween Edition.

I love Christmas, it's actually my favorite holiday, it's just that I didn't have the energy to even get in the Christmas spirit last week. I had just gotten off a week-long business trip, I was sick, I was behind on Christmas shopping, etc. I was mentally and physically exhausted in general so when it came time to make the FTT, I just didn't have the mental capacity to do anything other than the usual title.

Honestly, if my girlfriend didn't drag me around to go see our families then I probably would have ended up just staying home on Christmas Day. I'm glad she was in a better state of mind than I was.

"I know, right.  Memories keep popping in at random times, and I have to put them in somewhere.  The brain is a miraculous instrument.  
It's frankly kind of depressing, seeing all the loss of small businesses, and the loss of a way of life.  The price of progress, I guess.  
Not as depressing as when I did this same thing for the small town in Iowa my family is from, and Iowa in general, whichh is sadly pretty easy.    
In this Iowa town, there used to be TWO hat stores!  A music store!  Now it's practically faded into nothingness.   
 Iowa is beautiful but it totally lacks the boom-bust dynamism of Texas.  Technology made all these extra farm hands redundant.  Here, when Amazon makes your little candy store redundant, you have plenty of work.  In Iowa, the only option is get on the government dole, or move out.

Conroe isn't exactly liberal but it's definitely a better life than if you moved up to the Texas panhandle or anything. I have many friends and neighbours that are open about it and I don't think they have much push back (though any is too much IMHO). We do have a good pride party every year which is always a blast.,t2_gxe4h,originalhandy,0,1631720207.0,0,t1_hcymh1l,hcymh1l,True,nmykalh,t3_pm1pyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conroe/comments/pm1pyu/might_be_moving_there/,Might be moving there,/r/Conroe/comments/pm1pyu/might_be_moving_there/hcymh1l/,3,r/Conroe,0,3
"Lived there all my life until a couple of years ago.  As many others have said, it‚Äôs conservative but it doesn‚Äôt matter, Everyone is nice. When I picked up my brother from the high school, saw plenty of kids wearing pride colors or other non traditional attire. When I was there many years back, we had a couple of classmates coming out which was rare at the time but no one batted an eye. I got friends that are teachers who are really liberal and they‚Äôre fine. As an Hispanic I never received flack for speaking Spanish in open places. My manager who was super conservative was chill and awesome. She knew we were liberals (all of us workers) but she was what we about it. Moms work with plenty and they‚Äôre all super love her. (Immigrant) All in all, it‚Äôs chill but of course there might be that dick here and there that‚Äôs the stereotype. Definitely not perfect. Moms 

Cons: Cops are dicks. My brother, my cousin and I have been discriminated against. Again, for being brownies. Still makes me mad. I did receive a backhanded compliment lol. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nice and speak well as a Mexican.‚Äù Lol. Thanks? Asshole, haha. 
Or 
My favorite. An old old lady said to me: ‚Äú you‚Äôre so nice I just want to take you home with me and feed you all the tacos in the world.‚Äù I laughed so hard. 

Other cons. Sooo many cars from out of state the past few years. Traffic suuucks now. Everybody moving in. I‚Äôm like ‚Äúget out my town you damn out of staters‚Äù -shakes fist-

Con: everyone stuck in their world and some don‚Äôt improve their lives. At least in my circle. So much drama and some deal of, well, trashy people. 

Con:  trees are coming down. :(

Cons: for me not much to do. Although micro brews have opened up coupe of years before I left. Last I heard they got a couple more. 

I moved away and it‚Äôs been the best decision. I couldn‚Äôt do much for fun. Had to drive to Houston.

- watch out where you buy a home. Some areas have flooded, primarily along the San Jacinto river. 
- we have a lot of breweries for the size of the town, as well as places to go out and eat. 
- Conroe is rapidly expanding so home prices have shot up, neighborhoods are popping up all over the place, and the landscape will be changing in the coming years. Prices are inflated, but it could be a good time to invest given long term growth of the area.
- CISD is generally a great school district.

"Couple of fun facts before your rage boner gets too hard: the Texas no soliciting law is extremely limited and so full of holes as to be meaningless.

Mistake number one is having a no soliciting sign for an entire property. Those have no legal validity whatsoever. The only valid no soliciting sign is one posted at the individual door of each residence.

Number two, is that the Texas statute has broad exceptions in it for companies with which you have previously done business, home security sales, political campaigning, charitable solicitations, and religious proselytizing. In short, even if the no soliciting sign had any legal weight, which it doesn't, then a church is well within the law to go door-to-door and do whatever they feel called upon to do.

Assuming that you live within the city limits of Conroe, there is a peddlers ordinance which requires that door-to-door salesmen be registered with the city and have obtained a permit, but even then, with the exemptions in state law and the non-enforceable property-wide sign, it's pretty weak.

Basically, the only thing a no soliciting sign at your door is going to do is alert you to a shady seller, who will ignore the sign and still peddle their soaps or magazine subscriptions or whatever else.",t2_4mgk8,jhwells,0,1630325370.0,0,t1_hax4apf,hax4apf,True,[deleted],t3_pe6tcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conroe/comments/pe6tcs/these_people_littered_our_apartment_complex_with/,"These people littered our apartment complex with flyers this morning, even though we have no solicitation signs posted everywhere.

"Internet choices are Consolidated Communications and MidSouth Fiber. Both are high speed fiber, but I chose to go with MidSouth due to Consolidated's reputation for spotty internet issues. That said.. I called MidSouth to sign up on 7/27 and the earliest install they could give me was 9/2 on a new build. They are actually coming out today to install. They've already run the fiber to the house, just need the set up inside. Consolidated, on the other hand could get me going in a week. But I still chose to wait. 

The reputation of Consolidated comes mostly from word of mouth and from regional Next Door complaints. I have not heard the same about MidSouth. I did hear from one of my new neighbors (who hadn't signed up for either at the time) that her friend down the street had signed up for MidSouth and regretted it.. but she did not know why - my guess is the wait.

"That may be true but instead of building a *new* shopping center, why not invest in and renovate the current ones that are empty?

We have the Conroe outlet mall. The last time I was there most of the buildings were closed.

There are so many abandoned spaces that can be used for something new but they would rather cut down our trees for another ugly cement block.

You see it in Willis as well. They paved over a Historic City Park to build a new shopping center that is now barely occupied. Before that, they destroyed another park to put up a new City Hall.

I've seen this rivers edge development, it's built up 4-6' higher than the original grade, why?   It was in a low area by the river & the runoff into this carriage hills neighborhood was unreal, they posted a bunch of videos & pictures of actual streets flooding, let alone the yards full of silt.

I have been told that  interested citizens can go before the city zoning/plannning committees and petition to limit subdivisions to only having a certain percentage of rental properties. I think this is an excellent idea. Having corporations swallow up whole subdivisions is contributing to the shortage of affordable housing in our area and making it more difficult for first time home buyers to enter the market.

"Lots of good names in other comments, but...

1. Burger Boy - the oldest restaurant in Conroe. 

I used to live around the corner and would walk there all the time. Great people and everything's good on the menu. Also, when the entire Houston metro area was evacuating in advance of Hurricane Rita, BB was the last place to shut down service. The Sysco and Glazier trucks had stopped running a few days earlier and BB ran out of supplies. They started buying from the nearest Kroger, raised all their prices by $1, put an apology note on the door, and kept on cooking until it became impossible.


2. Cowboy's Burgers & Tacos - out on 2854 at  8535 Felder Ln, Conroe, TX 77304.

They do everything well.

3. Van Thong - Chinese-Vietnamese on 105 across from Whataburger

4. Gyro King - At 8975 TX-242, Conroe, TX 77385 in the Omega Motors used car lot. Best. Gyros. Around. The owners are Greek and close for a month or so every summer to travel back home. Absolutely worth the drive down 242.


Also, Hall Of Fame entries that have closed but would otherwise belong on the top of every list:

1. Dixies Bayou Victuals: The best Cajun place I've ever visited, hands down. Montgomery county hasn't had an equivalent Cajun restaurant since it closed.

2. Italian Deli Market: fantastic little place behind the new Buckalew dealership. They moved to a newer, bigger space on 105 and were closed within a year. :-(

3. Papa Nick's Greek & American: open in the same location as the original Italian Deli, Papa Nicks served great Greek food.",t2_4mgk8,jhwells,0,1616669542.0,0,t1_gs5mxd7,gs5mxd7,True,avan295,t3_mcirfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conroe/comments/mcirfu/what_are_your_favorite_local_restaurants_in_conroe/,What are your favorite local restaurants in Conroe?,/r/Conroe/comments/mcirfu/what_are_your_favorite_local_restaurants_in_conroe/gs5mxd7/,1,r/Conroe,0,1

"These are not my favorite but to each their own. 

I went to margarita and peppers twice last year and each time was pretty bad. 

The original la Palma tacos have gone downhill but still okay. I just think they have too much fat but good flavor. 

Vernon‚Äôs downgraded their food. They even have the cheapest ketchup. 

I haven‚Äôt had Joe‚Äôs in about a year because each time has been pretty tasteless. 

I went to the original Margarita‚Äôs on the north loop about two weeks ago and it still taste just as good as it did when I was a little girl. Check them out again.

"*le sigh...*

Of course you're right. I would welcome an influx of more open-minded populous. But alas, montgomery county is so damn red even a healthy dose of blue won't likely make a difference. To top that off it plays hell with our traffic. Lol Not that we ever had the most responsible of drivers here in the first place. In truth though I support inclusivity.

"Could it be a wall cloud formation??


A shelf cloud will usually be associated with a solid line of storms. ... Wall clouds will rotate on a vertical axis, sometimes strongly. The wall cloud is much smaller and more compact than a shelf cloud and is usually under a rain free cloud base. Scud clouds are often mistakenly called wall clouds or funnel clouds.

No flooding at all. It was interesting watching the snow and ice melt and run off. I think for 3 days there was a constant tiny little creek running to the drain.

For a similar price range but better topography check out graystone or somewhere more NW conroe.

"We live here. I do think they have addressed drainage throughout the development just fine. Yes there are palmettos.... and also feral hogs...

We absolutely love it here. The trails are wonderful but they are still working on them. The little dog parks are great for our pups. If you have golden doodle this is the neighbor for you. I swear there are like 50 in here. 
There are some crabby older couples in here that gripe about everything. Mostly about the apartments being build close by and that the lake house is too small and the pool is not fancy....

Close shopping. Close dinning. Close medical. 
Seriously...anywhere in Houston can flood with the right conditions. 
Another positive. We are on the same grid on the hospital and never lost power during the winter storm. 
Our home location was considered in the flood plain but was raised up. You can tell the street was raised as well and directs the water flow to the creek which then goes to grand lake and the others in here.

"A few things to consider...

If part of the neighborhood floods, the neighborhood could end up like River Plantation which has a reputation for flooding.  This would make it difficult to sell later down the road, as well as lowing the property value.

A 500 year floodplain does not mean that it‚Äôll flood once in 500 years. It means that each year it has a 1 in 500 chance of flooding. So if you have a 30 year mortgage, you have a 6% chance of the house flooding. 

Also, if the builder builds a lot of houses in a floodplain it will increase the risk of your ‚Äúsafer‚Äù part of the neighborhood to flood. There will be runoff and no place for the water to go that it had previously. This is true even in areas that are not in a floodplain. 

TLDR: I would not buy a house in any floodplain, especially when there are a lot of new developments in Conroe that are not in any floodplain.",t2_39uyhklh,art-is-gay,0,1614708898.0,0,t1_gpfvdcv,gpfvdcv,False,packnation_22,t3_lw3mtd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Conroe/comments/lw3mtd/thoughts_on_grand_central_park/,Thoughts on Grand Central Park,/r/Conroe/comments/lw3mtd/thoughts_on_grand_central_park/gpfvdcv/,5,r/Conroe,0,5

Personally, the word of a developer is worthless because they'll be long gone when trouble comes.

"I wouldn‚Äôt buy there because of flooding. The area is low lying marshland due to its proximity to the San Jacinto, especially the further south you go into the neighborhood.Look at this topographic map and you can see that it is lower than the rest of Conroe.
