Obviously it depends on your taste, but Gunbarrel, Erie, Lafayette, Superior, and even Golden would all be very attractive options for me if I were in your situation (Golden is in neighboring Jefferson County but only about a 30-minute drive into town). Broomfield isn't bad either. It all depends on how far you're willing to be outside of Boulder proper and exactly what you're preferences are. Traffic isn't unbearable in Boulder County as it can be in Denver, so it really doesn't take a significant amount of time to get anywhere if you're driving.

On my run today, I bumped into a totally naked dude. In my ramblings, I keep finding underwear just lying around - and I've kinda always wondered: wtf is up with all this underwear? Now I kinda know:

People don't know how to use natural materials to clean their bum - and it's actually not all that great of a choice in Boulder's OSMP: the ground is sandy, the trees aren't very leafy, there's not a lot of moss, the rocks are literally made of welded together sand, there's poison ivy everywhere - I get it. (I opt for the ""2 cups and go before my run"" method myself.)

But what some people are doing, is just using their underwear to wipe, then leaving it on the ground near their area of destruction.

"I can only remember a small handful of shows in the last 35 years. Concerts at Folsom are a decision between the university and the city of Boulder. It's a much bigger deal somehow than football games. I know that the residents (home owners) don't like the big influx of people and the police have a much greater presence at concerts than football. It has nothing to do with bands being able to sell it.

From the article linked:

Rock concerts were a summer staple at Folsom Field in the 1970s and the first half of the 1980s, but only have been staged a handful of times since — largely because they sometimes drew raucous fans who used nearby lawns as restrooms, drank too much, took too many drugs and caused massive traffic jams in the city.

“I got up about 4 o’clock in the morning with one concert,” Scoggin, 96, recalled recently. “People were calling back and forth to one another and shooting off firecrackers, so there was no sleeping. I looked across the street over at (my neighbor’s) house, and, in the front yard, there was this fellow, he was stark naked, and he was showering himself down with the garden hose.”

But CU, which went to great lengths in 1986 to curb future concerts at Folsom, says those are problems of the past, and has worked this spring to reassure the university’s neighbors. It’s a familiar refrain for the campus, which made such promises following a string of rowdy shows in the ’70s and ’80s.",t2_10t9js,6L6aglow,0,1648905525.0,0,t1_i33sf8r,i33sf8r,True,everyAframe,t3_tu8umc,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tu8umc/folsom_live_shows/,Folsom live shows,/r/boulder/comments/tu8umc/folsom_live_shows/i33sf8r/,3,r/boulder,0,3
">Part of the van idea is to have storage for stuff

Although this might seem like a ""two birds with one stone"" kind of solution, I think you might be better off separating your two problems (moving and basic transportation) in the longer term.

For reliable low-cost transportation, as others have said here, it's hard to beat a used Prius.   For storage, if you can find a friend with a garage, even one you can ""rent"" for a few weeks, you'll be infinitely better off than using your transportation as storage.   Vehicles get broken into often.   In this part of Colorado, the meth-hobo car-campers are not well liked, and you run the risk of getting hassled with a van full of what might look to some like a van-camper.   Hauling all of your things around daily has costs and risks.   And minivans have a high daily total cost of ownership relative to other vehicles.   Even if you can't find a friend with some short term storage space, a short term storage unit for a few hundred dollars would be a much better, more affordable solution than owning a minivan for a few months or years.

These are all awful problems to have when you're broke, and there's no great perfect solution.  But a van as a rolling storage unit/daily driver has so many risks and complications, I would just be wary of that.",t2_il2z7ydt,Freedom11Fries,0,1648905451.0,0,t1_i33safw,i33safw,False,nyjrku,t3_tu86gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tu86gs/poor_people_dont_deserve_cars/,Poor people don't deserve cars,/r/boulder/comments/tu86gs/poor_people_dont_deserve_cars/i33safw/,7,r/boulder,0,7
"It’s kind of up to the bands. Not everyone can fill a stadium, which is the capacity Folsom allows. The dead have always been a stadium band. When I was a kid back east the only nearby venue that could support them was RFK. 

Capacity at Folsom is 50,000. Dead and co play there because they can afford it and pack it the whole run. Not many other acts can boast the same. 

The dead and co book Folsom for 3 or more nights. That means they’re drawing up to 200,000 fans in a 4 night run. Not a lot of acts can do the same. When Metallica last played mile high it was just the one night. The mile high capacity is about 75k. Phish has a big following, but not that big. They rent out Dick’s for 4 nights every Labor Day, but dicks is 18k capacity and allows camping. 

The venue choice has more to do with capacity than anything. Bands who play red rocks are either up and coming or able to charge top dollar for exclusivity - because it’s a tiny capacity of 10k. Lots of times bands just outgrow it - that’s the goal anyway. 

I hope this helps. It isn’t like anyone is preventing other acts, it’s just that not everyone can get the same attendance in Boulder, so they pick much smaller venues in bigger cities.",t2_wifqo,Littlebotweak,0,1648904476.0,0,t1_i33qkux,i33qkux,True,everyAframe,t3_tu8umc,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tu8umc/folsom_live_shows/,Folsom live shows,/r/boulder/comments/tu8umc/folsom_live_shows/i33qkux/,5,r/boulder,0,5

 >Police corruption is a form of police misconduct in which law enforcement officers end up breaking their political contract and abuse their power for personal gain. This type of corruption may involve one or a group of officers. Internal police corruption is a challenge to public trust, cohesion of departmental policies, human rights and legal violations involving serious consequences. Police corruption can take many forms, such as bribery.

"Aha - OK, the first thing to do in this scenario is *stop using the laptop* (as in, power it off and leave it alone).

When files are deleted from a laptop, the machine doesn't typically go to the effort of actually destroying the files. Instead, the machine just removes the reference(s) to the files and makes that space available for storage of other files (adding that space to the free space available to the system, essentially). If the files were deleted fairly recently and there hasn't been much creation of new files afterwards, you can 'un-delete' the files with varying degrees of success (assuming the data in the deleted files hasn't been overwritten by saving newer files).

The 'un-delete' operation can likely be done by any competent PC repair place - it's not rocket science. You just work with the system to re-identify the deleted files as valid files on the system. This should be a lot less expensive than full-on forensic data recovery (which is not cheap).",t2_mmc5t,okbanlon,0,1648866097.0,0,t1_i329kg2,i329kg2,False,MrKahnberg,t3_tu6ymh,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tu6ymh/data_recovery/,data recovery,/r/boulder/comments/tu6ymh/data_recovery/i329kg2/,3,r/boulder,0,3

"Thanks for your thoughts. I guess, simply, I don’t think the Marshall fire would likely happen again soon. This sounded more like an anomaly, from what I gathered from articles, posts, friends, neighbors, etc. I recognize I might have that wrong, but that was my sense. An absolutely awful anomaly, but I’m not sure I’ve seen evidence that this the new normal and theres nothing we can do to stop it. Yes, this area needs to make meaningful changes. I think if I don’t see that in the coming years, I might reconsider. In the grand scheme, everywhere is going to deal with climate change. Some of us can leave for the less afflicted areas, but most can’t. I’d rather help Boulder be an example of how to better handle the effects of climate change than a helping Boulder be a ghost town. We can do prescribed burns, we can invest in land management, we can invest more in firefighters, we can mitigate these issues.

"You keep making this about being against poverty and I’m trying to tell you that you’re basically propping up a strawman here.

If people need to create a community to thrive amid poverty conditions, like a commune or similar, it’s a far cry from traveling across the country for a temporary gathering.  These happen every year apparently and it’s “unnecessary” in the sense that the gathering that impacts other people (again, in the nearby communities) is not a right.

My research showed that yes, it is a charity but the money that does get spent on the work is essentially paying people that were trained and make money presenting these materials.  You pay for training to become one of their representatives, so that's another revenue stream for the ""charity"". 

There used to be a lot of direct marketers on the phone who would raise money for ""fire fighters family fund"" or some equally worthy cause.  The actual charity got about 3% of the money raised.  But they got that with no work, just letting the marketing company use their name.

"Hard curfew. Spread out/pay lots. It's in a corporate  park. Lawn is steep. Its kind of far from my home in Boulder. Getting out after a show can SUCK depending on where you park. Sound is nothing special. It looks just like a thousand other sheds across the country.

"1. This cannot be stopped because there is no single entity that is responsible for it. No entity that claims ownership of the event, so for 50 years all the federal government could do is send out US Forest Rangers to issue citations and not have the local LE community overburdened with a mass event that lasts 2 months. 
2. Not to be too judgmental, but many of the attendees are in fact homeless or semi-homeless. There will be a large increase of homeless in Boulder, Lyons, Fort Collins before, during and after the event is concluded.

The entry level reps get 30% of donations. And I know the big boss gets at least 10% of what everyone makes and then the leaders also make a percentage of what their team makes. And as you get “promoted” you make even more. If you work 7 days a week on the 7th day you make 50%. So in reality how much is even going to the non profit? That’s why I ended up quitting. They also would make you work 11 hours and you end up getting like $100 for the day.

"I share many similar sentiments to you, especially on the 1st world problems, but if I’m being honest with myself I hold that sentiment in order to protect myself from the mental pain of accepting that the risk of fire is real and scary. I tell myself “you’re not special. People go through worse. Figure out an evacuation plan and move on.” However, in the case of Boulder and our changing climate, it may not be so simple as the above mental processing. I do think our mental models for risk need updating, because the climate has changed. The Marshall Fire was horrific and though the elements lined up in tragic way, our climate forecasts show this can happen again. After updating our mental model for accepting that level of devastation, the outcome is either a much higher degree of comfort with risk, or perhaps a move to less fire-prone area. This is all to say that I understand where you’re coming from, but for me there seems to be more concrete, material outcomes and choices to our new normal outside of our rationalization or mental processing.",t2_3rgk11kn,No_District_1514,0,1648828899.0,0,t1_i2zxm9o,i2zxm9o,False,No_District_1514,t3_tracog,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tracog/im_on_edge_and_very_afraid_given_recent_fires_in/,"I’m on edge and very afraid given recent fires in Boulder.

"Yes. Ie in the rainbow gathering group in a discussion on wildfires there's some suggestions to move it, well see what happens. Any locals and wildfire are people know that a true fire can and would kill a devastating number of people in an event with thousands of people who have to walk miles to their cars then exit with thousands of cars on one lane roads through a forest, let alone impact the surrounding areas and destroying other people's lives. Well see what they decide. Just don't think they don't know and wise ones won't speak

I imagine fs will have no choice but to close the forests if it's really bad and rainbow can go fuck themselves (set up another site). It's really up to usfs implementing absolute closure or not. We don't know how bad it's going to be in July, rainbow might wait a bit too long but eventually it'll get sorted.

I think it's important to also recognize John Mayer, one of the greatest living guitarists, made the choice to be in this band going on year 7 now. There is clearly something mystic and enticing about the music and entity that is the Grateful Dead.

I could write a dissertation on why I disagree with your relatively simplistic view of something I identify with so much but I don't think it's my job to nor would you care. Bob Weir is a legend and a myth personified. He tells ageless stories of triumph and loss and I'd really invite you to read some of what is being said in these songs. He's 74 years old... I doubt pail McCartney can sing like he once could. 

But here I go rambling on because again, this means so much to me and thousands of people like me. I feel like that is worth a lot in and of itself. These songs are timeless, and some of the great spiritual thinkers of our day (ram dass, Joseph Campbell, etc) recognize it as such.

"I am a prototype machinist so I understand what it takes to make the components. the engineering is the interesting part. Looking at the picture it looks like the rear ""cassette"" we will call it, it's a bit different from a chain driven cassette but not much, has that taken in to account. It has a spiral design for the indentions to allow the drive gear to slip on to the main part of the teeth. Instead of the vertical orientation for chain driven, gears are horizontal in this machine. So the indentions are horizontal too. When you shift I imagine there are one of two possibilities to keep it timed and not grind... either the mechanism that pushes the main drive gear in and out allows it to slip before being fully messed with the rear sprocket, or the whatever pushes it is timed with the ""drive shaft"" such that it is always meshed when shifting. Allowing the teeth to perfectly sync when shifted. 

&#x200B;

Very cool idea. It seems that the angular spacing between teeth is the same and the diameter of the rear gears is what changes the ratio. I believe larger rear gear is the lowest gear since you would have to pedal more to get it to rotate fully. I would imagine if they perfected the shifting mechanism, it's almost unnoticeable from gear to gear other than resistance difference from each gear. Very cool. I bet it has some sort of clutch system to allow for not pedaling and not acting like a fixie. I would love to see a video of that thing shifting while pedaling.",t2_2sp0n6g7,Rickc137bitch,0,1648796183.0,0,t1_i2yd8fg,i2yd8fg,False,FreshhSqueezedOJ,t3_ttew21,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/ttew21/three_bikes_worth_80k_were_stolen_wednesday_night/,Three bikes worth $80K were stolen Wednesday night 😳,/r/boulder/comments/ttew21/three_bikes_worth_80k_were_stolen_wednesday_night/i2yd8fg/,7,r/boulder,0,7

"I’m sure relevant conversations could lead to all kinds of topics from capitalism (and those that fall through the cracks) to conservation to hedonism.

I think what it boils down to, on some level, is that this gathering simply isn’t necessary.  The size and the scale is really the sticking point for the ramifications it brings.  Smaller groups would attract way less attention, cause way less potential harm, and would achieve similar aims.  A gathering this large (30,000?or thereabouts) is 100% a vanity and not a necessity.   

Plus, the lead mod of that rainbow subreddit is seriously unhinged.  I skimmed that post/manifesto and it was full of crazy. He might not represent all of the goers, but he’s associated with them.  For all the peace and love he was trying to represent, he was pretty damn hostile in his post.  

Anyway, last thing: if these people weren’t disruptive, weren’t rude, weren’t causing problems, etc — nobody would know about it.  Not the NIMBYs, not the conservationists, no one.

"Pretty much every year, same freak out, then same realization that they clean the forest better than any permitted gathering does. They're super fire sensitive and anytime there's a rule (ie no fires, like at a nm gathering recently) they enforce it. When they do have fires they have strict precautions about the fires. The rule enforcement.. If you touch a cup to the serving spoon ten people yell don't touch the thing to the thing. If there's a smoking restriction or fire restriction (ie only fires at designated spots, or no fires) it'll be implemented. They have councils on all matters of concern and do listen to locals. Locals often report, great for business and people were super kind. Goes by and no I survived rainbow gathering t shirt indeed was ever really required. 

Im not a rainbow guy (studied poverty in America for most of a decade living with the poor, I know rainbows well. For me it's a chance to be of service, to meet good people, and to have fruitful random connections but.. I don't even smoke weed yall I'm not a rainbow guy). I just want people to realize that rainbow, though seen as sort of dieing as the hippie movement slowed (within the group there are some who don't go anymore, aren't happy with them. They used to be more classes and organization. Some rainbows around the world still are, Israel's is known for this), has come to be a refuge for poor, traveller's, all stripes of disadvantaged people. They have a free event to go to. Everyone gets fed. Everyone is equal. You can come with five bucks or ten thousand bucks you get the same food and same respect as anybody, and be in a place where you matter (if you didn't get gist of the big picture of intention, these are people building a free village where everything is free and all are welcome. It's a fuck you to inequality and the west, born of visions of healing from the harm of capitalism. No wonder they don't get a shit when Karen's across the country act like it's ww3 because a rainbow is going tk be nearby. Why respect capitalist haters of the poor who want to restrict freedoms and make them for the wealthy, and concoct every reason to do it). 

They still follow sanitation protocols from patch Adam's, one of the many people who visited and saw these people as humans. I heard Bill Murray went. Wynona Ryder.. Anyway I don't care about celebrities, but lots of normal people go. 

They have the same concerns you do. Also, why do the feds pull over every person going into the gathering multiple times and ticket every single person for every minor thing, giving tons of people Court dates so they have to hang out in the area? Why do this to the poor? How does that help? Police presence is sent every year that is just astounding to see. Rainbow ""members"" which is not a thing are listed as gang members in government databases. Most rainbow people don't respond to posts like this: they've given up on you. They're poor; they know regulars don't care; they're used to being punched in the face--why bother? Why does every negative story get front page coverage, then the letters sent by usfs Park rangers saying wow we've never had a group clean up like this before would be glad to have you back get ignored? At a group of ten thousand people, the few amounts of bad things that happen, especially considering the weight of the burdens American poor carry, is a tremendous sign they do a more than good job. The hit pieces that come out saying otherwise rarely come from people who know gatherings. You can find articles about diapers and garbage being left; this factually never happens at an annual. People spend weeks there just to clean up. In fact if you're at a gathering after the event you'll be yelled at by randoms all day if it doesn't look like you're helping. They clean, including micro trash, and naturalize - break up any unnatural changes. Saw one of these articles saying shitting in the ground requires 8 Oz of bleach per person per day dumped into the environment (not true of course). People who don't know what they're talking about getting the loudest voice. To crush a small movement largely filled with poor people having a good time. 

Surely there have been murders at a gathering, weird stuff. There's not only national large ones, but little ones, which can be weirder (ie Ocala FL attracts a lot of native FL homeless, leading tk the phrase ""that's some Ocala rainbow gathering shit"" to describe dumb ass behavior). But a saying goes, if a predator tries to assault someone, that's who gets killed. Citizen justice. Mostly it's a peaceful pleasant and kind of boring atmosphere with a lot of people chilling out and making and serving free food. 

They have an area where alcoholics are safe to be. They get loved, taken care of, cared for. But they also have chassidic rabbis who show up every year, a huge Christian camp, huge hindu kitchen (make the best food), and tons of random groups of people. Anybody can set up a kitchen. One guy does a free kitchen in Boulder! And does this same kitchen at rainbow. Believes in it--and in being of service. 

You should be very careful about taking away safe spaces for poor people. You've taken enough,

"Really take this how you will no judgment. We have cool season grass that will start to go dormant in early June. May is a time for the grass to shove a lot of energy into the roots. A good way to keep the grass looking green all summer is to mow a lot in the spring and have a very health lawn. 

If you were to not mow then chop it at the end of May you would be not forcing the energy into the roots and by cutting it down to a reasonable height for summer it would likely stress out the lawn right before it goes dormant. Additionally it would be difficult to mulch the clippings into the lawn removing nutrients. 

If you are interested in saving the environment/promoting bee health it would probably be better to plant native plants and not turf grass. If you like the turf grass and want to have less impact on the environment start you lawn care regiment now so you aren’t fighting and using to much water this summer.",t2_fbr1a4e,CMWalsh88,0,1648773479.0,0,t1_i2x7lmv,i2x7lmv,True,Gorctam,t3_tt0giw,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tt0giw/no_mow_may/,No mow may,/r/boulder/comments/tt0giw/no_mow_may/i2x7lmv/,5,r/boulder,0,5

"Your mom sounds like a special lady, those pups were lucky they had her. ❤️

Behavioral euthanasia is definitely a last resort, I just try to help others at least put it in the set of possibilities who might not otherwise, just in case. Having to live a shitty life can be worse. Living in fear and anxiety can be too, but getting a better permanent home is ideal. I think OP is in a better spot than most being able to put up a full on domain for info. It just sucks. My dog had 5 years of history I have no idea about, but this occurs in dogs people raised from 8 weeks too. It’s not always explained away by a torrid past, which has got to be gut wrenching. People want to jump to conclusions and judge, but I’ve learned reactivity in dogs can be nature or nurture or both. 

I volunteer at a shelter nearer to me that targets pit bulls. The woman who runs it is super dedicated. I found my way there pretty quick after reconciling what I was dealing with. She has a behaviorist who trains volunteers to help rehab the dogs. But, it’s all dog aggression - she won’t take the dog if it’s people aggressive in the first place. That’s one of the no-kill works arounds too. You can decline and refer to last chance.

Ultimately, I love my dog, and she is a great house dog. She’s also a surprisingly great hiking dog for one that was so chonky. Seeing her transform from a bread loaf that couldn’t help compulsively returning to her crate for the first week to a fairly accomplished explorer has been amazing. We’re in a good spot with her behavior now, but the reality of putting others at risk of harm had to be mitigated in a big way and it was not easy or cheap. Putting up a fence in 2021 was no joke.

"> They will keep it quarantined from other animals and feed it and try to find a home with a professional for omelet. Or they will hold onto her until she dies. 

I got my dog from one of these places in the San Luis valley - not just no kill, but last chance. No kill shelters will often offload dogs for euthanizing while last chance keeps them forever, big difference. 

The thing is, my experience has not convinced me that living out their days in a kennel at a last chance shelter is better than euthanizing. 😬

Because, you’re right - the odds of this dog having a happily ever after are slim. I realized with our dog very quickly that our options were deal with the behavior issues or behavioral euthanasia (because I wasn’t taking her back to that shelter, it was not a life worth living there). 

Our goal was to get a dog that needed a home and wasn’t first pick. At the time we didn’t realize how that description also covers dogs with known, serious behavioral issues. 

It didn’t help that the shelter volunteers were not at all forthcoming with the dog histories. They liked to use platitudes and blame “bad people” and insisted that these were all great dogs who “mostly wanted to be only children”. This was all code language. I noticed the volunteer working with us was visibly afraid of a lot of the dogs. So, I specifically asked her to show us dogs who didn’t have aggression issues. She points out a 110lb mastiff and talks about how well trained he is and how much his family loved him (never why he was there). I walked him and out of nowhere a sweet little bichon frise appears and the mastiff goes for it.

We should have left, but people in this situation, including me, can be stubborn. My partner asked to walk an obese, sausage of a dog in a damp corner who had trouble standing up. 

She was turning 5 and it sounded like she had been there for years, returned at least once, maybe more. We picked her because she was one of the only dogs the volunteer seemed to feel safe touching and treating through the kennel wires - she sat without too much persuasion, and she looked at me in the eyes for direction. She showed no signs of aggression. As soon as we got home, I put her in the tub, and she didn’t protest. She was 65lbs, not a featherweight, bathing wasn’t easy, but she had every opportunity to pounce - she never did (nor has). 

Her reactive (to the point of aggression) behavior came out pretty quick. It’s just like OP describes - she loves us, she’s sweet and loyal and cuddly. She bonded to us no problem. It was immediate, like she understood caretaker hand off. 

But, people who come on the property are not welcome. She goes into a typical barking alert, but it doesn’t stop and she never reaches a point where she can greet. Same thing on walks, people and dogs. She gets this deep, throaty growl and I swear she channels Zuul.

There were other serious incidents, but no ER trips or injuries, more like near misses. 

We chose to stick it out, but only because we could. I can think of countless past living situations I’ve been in where it wouldn’t have worked at all - she’d have been a nervous mess in a city like Boulder (and she is when we visit the in laws). We live on acreage out in a rural part of the state, we were prepared even though we didn’t know it. This doesn’t mean she gets to run and play without a leash, she is always leashed outside, but it does mean triggers can be minimized. 

I don’t think there’s any amount of counter conditioning that will “fix” her. I think that socialization ship sailed long ago. But, I can board her, and that was a game changer. No one can come in and get her out of her crate, but if I take her off site and we walk in? She receives those people like old friends. So, when we have out of town visitors, we board. Short visit guests are fine too, she’s perfectly happy in her crate - probably from all the kennel years, it really is a safe space. 

Would I do it all again, knowing what I know now? I don’t think so. This was a real eye opener and an experience that has countered every cliche I ever believed in about a home for every dog. She won the golden ticket, but it was pure chance. I knew she’d have a better rest of her life here than the shelter she came from, even if it was cut short. I feel shelters like the one she came from are setting the dogs up for failure in the form of revolving doors by not being up front with the histories, but even worse they’re putting people in danger. Real danger, dogs over a certain weight are no joke. 

I know not all last chance shelters conduct business this way, I’m sure there are some that are honest about their dogs histories, but this is a common issue with them, unfortunately. 

I really hope OP finds someone, but taking a dog to a last chance because it makes us feel better about not euthanizing is kind of a cop out solution. I honestly now believe that euthanizing can be more humane than that. 

I had to rehome a dog years ago because she needed to be with someone 24/7. That was much easier to accomplish than even considering rehoming a dog with known aggression. I was able to see how that dog was via social media until she died of old age. So, I know rehoming _can_ work and even be monitored in a way. But, man, the anxiety that comes with willingly giving someone else a live, loaded weapon is a lot.",t2_wifqo,Littlebotweak,0,1648761845.0,0,t1_i2wggnl,i2wggnl,False,Gredelston,t3_tsipr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tsipr0/looking_for_an_adventure_buddy_experienced_with/,"Looking for an adventure buddy?

"My family and I moved to Boulder about three years ago with our little ones, and have thought long and hard about this as well. I have gone back an fourth many times on whether we should think about moving again (we came from New York) and here's where I've netted:

* This idea that we can make the environment bend to our will is a relatively new idea in history. Boulder a hundred years ago had regular wildfires. As we've become more technologically advanced, and think that now it's a given that we can live anywhere we want with no risks. Unfortunately, Mother Nature has giving us a real wake up call that this is not the case. I think of this in a comforting way. This is not new or special, really the past 100 years was special. We're just going back a bit to how things used to work. We will adapt.
* No judgement here, but these are really 1st world problems. Most of us are not going to be living on the streets if we lost our home to a wildfire. It's an inconvenience in life. In the end, if we did lose our homes, its just stuff that we lost. There are many places in the world that's living in a climate-driven post-apocalypse that have it much much worse. Again, I find some comfort thinking this way. We have it pretty good. 
* Of all the types natural disasters we could face, wildfires are the least scary to me. You can't put out a hurricane. You can't do prescribed tornados. Wildfires are something we can mitigate greatly with good policy. Much harder to do that with rising sea levels and extreme heat.
* [Propublica came out with a great piece on the impact of climate change in areas of the United States](https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/). It gives rankings to counties based on how affected it will be by climate change. Boulder has one of the better ratings. I haven't seen others mention it in this thread, but its not just wildfires, seas levels, hurricanes and tornados. Extreme heat is going to make many places unlivable. 
* If you actually lived that close to the NCAR fire, I would feel pretty happy. You just got a controlled burn that will make it  less likely to lose your home for quite a while. I felt like this ended up being a blessing in disguise. 
* It seems like every generation thinks they're living in the apocalypse. My great grandfather escaped famine, my grandfather fought in WW2, my parents lived with the fear of nuclear holocaust, and we're living with the threat of climate change (and pandemic, and perhaps another nuclear holocaust, and maybe famine driven by climate change, ok, maybe we do have it the worst...)

So what should I do? I have great insurance. I have a fire plan. I'll figure it out when I need to. I donate to the red cross and I vote for politicians who support climate action. I have faith that humanity will figure this out. I don't think we're just going to let Boulder burn to ashes. 

My two cents.

Here is the other side of the story from Utah in 2014 where a Rainbow regular by the chosen name of *Hitler* stabbed multiple people and was arrested. And overall the gathering with only 8000 required half a million dollars of USFS money to contain. However, this year they are labeling it as the *World* Gathering and encouraging (and expecting) 30-80k people to attend according to several of the Elders. https://www.krqe.com/news/new-mexico/rainbow-family-gathering-to-bring-thousands-to-taos-co-for-prayers-for-peace/

"Absolutely.  You could hike easily hike around Chautauqua all day.  It also connects to the NCAR trails via the Mesa Trail, but I'm not sure if that area is still closed because of the recent fire.  

If you want a real big hike you could take the Chautauqua Trail->Flatirons Loop->Royal Arch.  That would easily take around 3.5 hours.  If you want more from there you could take the Mesa trail when you're on your way back down, over to Enchanted Mesa to Mclintock which will spit you out at the Auditorium.  Otherwise you can take Bluebell all the way down to the parking lot after Royal Arch.

"Background: grew up with a family business of doing rehab for rescued fighting dogs and personally helped rehab dozens of dogs as a kid/teenager. 

This isn't really the kind of dog you can adopt out to new people. It's really a sad fact but my mom had a lot of dogs like this and as the owner of a dog rescue she ended up keeping a lot of them (luckily for everyone they tended to be a lot older than 2 and so wouldn't be around too much longer on their own). The reason you can't really give a dog like this away is because whether you like it or not, it has bonded to you and it doesn't like other people and likely sees them as a threat. 

This can be seen by the ""controls and is aggressive with people who enter our home"" bit but also the ""she is super snuggly alone at home with us"". 

If you don't want to put this dog down my advice is to do what a lot of people who fight dogs do. Take the dog to a no-kill rescue and say you found them without a collar and held on to them for a week or so but realized you can't deal with their bad habits and that they bit a friend hard enough to draw blood. They will keep it quarantined from other animals and feed it and try to find a home with a professional for omelet. Or they will hold onto her until she dies. This happened in my mom's shelter quite a few times.",t2_ml1x19s,nostradamoose96,0,1648738815.0,0,t1_i2usg47,i2usg47,True,Gredelston,t3_tsipr0,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/tsipr0/looking_for_an_adventure_buddy_experienced_with/,"Looking for an adventure buddy?

"Consider joining a local CSA (Community Supported Agriculture). We have been members of the CSA at Cure Farms on Valmont and it has been AWESOME. We pick up fruits, veggies, eggs, herbs, & coffee almost year round. There are many small farms that sell various provisions east of Boulder (ie Jay Rd or Cherryvale/Arapaho). Nude Foods 30th & (Mapleton?) offers waste-free goods (soaps, detergents, oils, honey, gF bread, etc etc); it’s a little pricy but good quality. As for clothes & thrifts, I LOVE the Arc thrift store in Lafayette on South Boulder Road. Also in Lafayette is Jax Farm & Ranch for work clothes. Otherwise, always keep an eye out on Sierra Trading Post & maybe even Backcountry .com for Clearance & clothing sale deals. I’ll add more as I think of it.

"This is not a diss. I want to highlight a few things that are in the mix of contemplating this community: there is one gas station, with a bad rep. PD and Sheriff share juridiction because parts are incorporated. That means the Sheriff dept. covering the entire county: up to Ned over to Louisville up to Longmont, may be your law enforcement. They are spread thin. I don't know that the PD patrols Gunbarrel much but I also don't know how many officers are spread across the city any given shift. Gunbarrel is quiet but we have property crime. It has become much more common the last 3-4:years. Last, if you are in unincorporated Gunbarrel note that you don't get to vote for city council members yet their actions greatly affect Gunbarrel.

"All the other posts are here beaming about gunbarrel and I really don't want to take away from that - I have some very close friends who lived there for years and loved it, and I had some fun times out there.   But I want to just offer a different perspective...

I'd say if you're moving to Boulder for the first time and can afford it,  move to the older, historic core of Boulder.  It's an amazing little town and the walkability and bikability are literally world class.  If you don't like students,  just stay away from the Hill and Goss Grove.  I'm 5 blocks from Pearl and rarely see students, and the ones I do see are chill. 

Living in Gunbarrel, every time you want to go to Pearl Street, the Creek, Sanitas, the farmers market, any festival,  museums, campus sports, Chautauqua / Bear Peak / Green Mt, XC skiing in North Boulder Park, etc etc etc - Basically all of the things we live here in Boulder for -  you have to rely on the bus or drive in and search for parking.  Eventually coming downtown starts to feel like a chore and you stop doing it much.   That's how my friends were at least.    But if you live in the core of town you can easily walk or bike to all of it and you just end up doing more of everything. In my experience at least. 

My time here won't be forever - my rent burden is way too high - but I feel like I'm really experiencing what Boulder has to offer while I'm here.  I know I would hole up at home a lot more or in Gunbarrel or even Table Mesa or North Boulder.

There's a pretty health mix of ages - the apartment complexes seem to skew younger, but the SFHs have a mix of families with children, childless couples, and empty nesters who've been here for decades.

The King Soopers shopping area is walkable from much of Gunbarrel, which is a huge benefit for me. 

The biggest drawback is the restaurant selection. Not much I have really found to be decent beyond Protos, Snarfs, and Avery. There's not a downtown area like you have in Lafayette or Longmont.

if it truly is as dry as it could be, as the seasons are getting crazy in the west (july is extremely rarely peak fire season previously now thats common) they might even have to set up smoking rules. whatever they do set up, *it will be enforced* cause at a gathering anyone not following rules (ie if you touch your bowl to a serving utencil, or dont wash your hands before receiving food) youll be told the fuck off by a bunch of loud angry hippies (specifically, theyll yell 'dont touch the thing to the thing' loudly)

"If you want to learn, I suggest, get a basketball and start learning dribbling.  It'll make your movements less awkward once you are ready for the  court. 

Adult newbies  generally play up right, rigid, and stiff. They don't really understand fundamentals of dribbling, so they tend to foul like crazy, reaching in and tripping and can be very dangerous for others to play with.

"""Solar panel efficiency is just now at 17-23%, with continual improvements to come.""

From the information I'm seen, I doubt there will be large improvements in the efficiency of commercially available rooftop solar panels in the medium-term future. See the Wikipedia article

 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_cell\_efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency)

and chart 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar\_cell\_efficiency#/media/File:Best-research-cell-efficiencies-rev220126\_pages-to-jpg-0001.jpg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cell_efficiency#/media/File:Best-research-cell-efficiencies-rev220126_pages-to-jpg-0001.jpg)

If you study that chart, you'll see that ""research"" solar cells have been and are being made from many different materials, with a wide range of efficiencies. But the large rooftop solar panels that homeowners have been installing for affordable(\*) prices (\* at least before the recent price increases) are made from either **single-crystal silicon** (non-concentrator), the solid blue squares in the chart, record efficiency (research cell) = 26.1%, or **multicrystalline silicon**, the open blue squares in the chart, record efficiency (research cell) = 23.3%.

The highest efficiency solar cells in the chart, the purple lines and symbols, are called multi-junction cells, and are made from thin layers of III-V semiconductor materials, with many different layers in a single device. Don't expect to see a rooftop solar panel based on multijunction cells and III-V semiconductor materials for sale in your favorite home improvement store any time soon.",t2_zjd4a,highfructoseSD,0,1648674607.0,0,t1_i2rkpzq,i2rkpzq,False,NCSeb,t3_ts8gaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/ts8gaq/recommendations_for_costing_solar_panels/,Recommendations for costing solar panels,/r/boulder/comments/ts8gaq/recommendations_for_costing_solar_panels/i2rkpzq/,3,r/boulder,0,3

not to say rainbows are perfect, most scenes at a gathering its not like i find lots of closeness with just anyone who comes.

but ive seen God work through the rainbow gatherings and so i have to fight the fear in you people fed shit show stories and say: you know, its really not that bad. and, it really provides a benefit to these people. and, these fears have been felt before, and usually it ends up being no big deal.

There’s more. Seriously. GTFO. I’ve been homeless. I am poor. I am BIPOC. I am not for this stupid shit. Do this stuff where it won’t endanger plants, animals, and water.

"They really can attract some bad people. This is not a formal news story, but I knew a guy who, when he was a teenager, asked to buy some weed and shrooms from the Rainbow Kids (grew up in Boulder). Some old guy who was a member said he'd give these things to him for free if he drank a quart-ish of some strange liquid he offered the kid. He was a dumb teen so of course he grabbed it and drank it all.

It was supposedly full of acid (probably a cocktail of different stuff). He couldn't stop vomiting, and was high and hallucinating for a month (at least that's what I was told). He had to go to the hospital and they prescribed him xanax for the severe anxiety this gave him.

Obviously, he never reported this to police because it was way before weed was legal here and he was afraid. Also, I know this guy doesn't represent everyone who is a member of the Rainbow Kids, but they really can influence the communities they travel to and if you have any kids or teens make sure to talk to them about drug safety before they encounter someone else who will take advantage of their ignorance.",t2_izm7fneb,bumblinglikecrazy,0,1648665522.0,0,t1_i2qxnik,i2qxnik,False,Jointhamurder,t3_trla20,https://www.reddit.com/r/boulder/comments/trla20/it_appears_a_rainbow_gathering_is_coming_to/,It appears a Rainbow Gathering is coming to Colorado this year.,/r/boulder/comments/trla20/it_appears_a_rainbow_gathering_is_coming_to/i2qxnik/,4,r/boulder,0,4
