Western MA is fine if you enjoy weed and hiking, but you want to do more with your time off - there's a lack of things to do. Not in a way a city like Boston can offer.

There's also no beaches. A girl can not summer sitting by a river. I found myself driving back to boston every weekend, every summer, for the soul purpose of sitting by the ocean and having real beach days. Western MA sucks for beaches. Ponds, lakes, whatever.

"it's disgusting really

the entire system is a joke

this is and always will be war on low income

the police have become far more wealthy then the citizens they serve and we all know how people handle wealth gaps. they always treat people with dignity and respect yeeeea right

It used to be stability as a public servant and the private sector was a gamble of sorts to try the field of skill you desired. Now they stand  there and make more then the people busting their asses at job sites and in the end have nothing

People that think we are soo far removed from socialism should just look at the indicators of wages for public servants compared to most in the communities they serve and then it's esay to understand why they lord over people

and before you union people chime in with we makemore then X...the police road duties are out of control and make far far more then the guy dragging brush etc

"Thanks for the suggestion! The telephone use is partly logistics, but mostly because we are trying to avoid time cues (eg someone could call their friend and just ask them what time it was). We do this because when people know the time of day or how long they've been awake/asleep, it often affects their performance and responses. For example, if I asked how hungry you felt and you knew that it was way past your normal meal time, you might rate yourself as being hungrier than if you didn't know the time. Or if I ask how tired you are and you know you only slept 5 hours, you might rate yourself as being more tired vs. if you didn't know and had to gauge it based only on how you were feeling.

">The MCAS does factor into students ability to graduate. If you don’t pass the Math, English and Science sections you don’t get a diploma. That is a state mandate not a district one.

I see that now, it has definitely changed since my time.

>I think your second idea was about time… I think the English session I proctored last week was scheduled to take 90 mins. Most kids in my room were done within about an hour. But we had to sit there for 3.5 hours while the testing session was in progress. It’s low on my list of complaints - but it’s an incredible waste of time for most kids to just sit there.

Again, different when I took it, but definitely see how it is a waste. I think the testing time was shorter back then and the test filled it better.

>You can predict MCAS scores by zip code. I guarantee I could move to a more affluent district, do half the work and my kids would still pass. Instead I work in a “failing” district even though I can show that my students are making more growth year over year than my more affluent neighboring districts…but because I moved my kids from a 5th grade reading level to an 8th grade reading level in a single year and not from 9th grade - 10th grade level (on grade level) I’m told by commenters in this thread that I’m failing at my job and don’t like MCAS simply because I want to collect that fat union paycheck with no accountability…

I totally agree this is horrible, as someone who came from one of the ""failing"" districts. I think this is an inherent problem of how school funds are distributed at the municipal level though, rather than a problem with the test. It is an unfortunate reality that kids in these underfunded districts are so behind that they can be raised 3 grade levels and still be behind their peers in wealthier districts. You definitely should not be shamed for amazing work like that. We cannot make it easier for some for everyone to perform equally though, we need to distribute funds evenly to all districts. Cities with low property values collect low amounts of taxes and have underfunded school systems.

>It’s not unreasonable to have some kind of standardized test but how we’re doing it now - and how we tie funding or prestige to it- seems broken and designed to keep poor kids down.

I definitely agree school funding should not be tied to the results of the test. If anything, the underperforming districts should be getting more funding. That is an inherent problem with how the state distributes funds once again, but not the test. Overall, I definitely see the points you are making and I agree. I still think this post is a little over the top and doesn't address the real issues behind it all. The test probably isn't the best, and the funding definitely isn't. I just think that calls for adjustments of the test, not removal, and funds distributed more fairly.

"For what it’s worth - I’m not the one downvoting you and I appreciate the dialogue. 

The MCAS does factor into students ability to graduate.  If you don’t pass the Math, English and Science sections you don’t get a diploma.  That is a state mandate not a district one. 

For students in special education or who are limited English proficiency they have the opportunity to retake it, potentially complete a portfolio that could be used to demonstrate mastery or receive a certificate of attainment in place of their diploma.   None of those options are ideal and incredibly prejudicial towards certain populations of students.  I’ve had kids who are brilliant but are learning English - they can’t pass the test because they’re not allowed to take the test in their native language. 

It also creates a problem around curriculum and when certain courses get taught because they have to be tested. In theory you could have every kid complete the MCAS in the spring of the senior year after they’ve learned everything - but if they fail the test for whatever reason they have no time to take those other routes to graduation and end up without a diploma.  

There’s also just a lot of reasons why kids might fail a test - testing anxiety, poorly constructed tests (which MCAS is notorious for), trauma, etc…

I think your second idea was about time… I think the English session I proctored last week was scheduled to take 90 mins.  Most kids in my room were done within about an hour.  But we had to sit there for 3.5 hours while the testing session was in progress.  It’s low on my list of complaints - but it’s an incredible waste of time for most kids to just sit there. 

You can predict MCAS scores by zip code.  I guarantee I could move to a more affluent district, do half the work and my kids would still pass.  Instead I work in a “failing” district even though I can show that my students are making more growth year over year than my more affluent neighboring districts…but because I moved my kids from a 5th grade reading level to an 8th grade reading level in a single year and not from 9th grade - 10th grade level (on grade level)  I’m told by commenters in this thread that I’m failing at my job and don’t like MCAS simply because I want to collect that fat union paycheck with no accountability…

It’s not unreasonable to have some kind of standardized test but how we’re doing it now - and how we tie funding or prestige to it- seems broken and designed to keep poor kids down.",t2_1gyj0e4y,poprof,0,1649002550.0,0,t1_i38krfr,i38krfr,False,BlueShoeSwitcheroo,t3_tuzv7v,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tuzv7v/why_students_should_not_take_mcas/,Why Students Should NOT Take MCAS,/r/massachusetts/comments/tuzv7v/why_students_should_not_take_mcas/i38krfr/,2,r/massachusetts,0,2

"You can predict MCAS scores by zip code.  It also doesn’t measure the gains made by students over time it only measures whether or not a student has reached a threshold.  

So students in one district might make 2 years worth of growth in a single year with a phenomenal set of teachers but they might not still make their grade level threshold according to the test.  Are we supposed to say that those teachers failed at their jobs?  I don’t think so. 

It’s not like teachers in Hopkinson or Wellesley are doing something extraordinary while teachers in Lawrence are sitting at their desks with their feet up.  

You’re oversimplifying a very complicated issue.  Student MCAS scores don’t factor into my evaluation at all - but they do factor into district funding formulas and whether or not a kid can graduate.  For most students - it’s just a boring test and teaching the threshold is easy - for others it’s incredibly anxiety producing because it’s a significant barrier for them.  

Had a student from Afghanistan move into my caseload a few weeks ago with very limited English - the kid is very bright - but they were told by the state that they had to take MCAS this year and it would impact their ability to graduate.

"Teacher of 10th graders here. While I'm not of fan of having a single test being required to graduate, your assessment of the situation is way, way off base. 

1. Your assessment of students taking a test ""22% of school days"" is extremely misleading. To start off with, the way you're phrasing your statement implies that the testing takes up the entirety of each of those school days, which is simply not the case. My unit exams have to fit in under a 1 hour block, so I'd have to imagine that your ELA and Math unit exams would take less time. While students may have all day to complete MCAS, the expectation is that students of all grades should be able to finish it in under 2.5 hours.
2. Based on the testing schedule you posted, if anything, the main fault lies with your specific district/school. I mean, you take 10 ""days"" to perform DRA, DIBELS and Challenge Screening tests... all things which are specific to your district.
3. With regards to your first anecdote, the proctor is allowed to tell the child that if they don't know the answer, they can move on to the next question. That statement is part of the test directions in the TAM (which you all were supposed to read), and you are allowed to repeat test directions at any time.
4. The 4th grade girl whose father had just died would not be required to take MCAS, and the fault with that lies solely with the main test administrator for your school.
5. Your story about the 5th grade girl should also place the blame squarely at your admin. There is no prohibition on the school removing her from the testing room after she finishes. The school would have been well within its right to pull her out and either give her an opportunity to speak with a counselor, or give her something else to do.
6. Your statement about ""plotting fractions on a number line"" goes a long way to showing why students have terrible math skills once they reach me in high school. That task tests an extremely important skill... numeracy. McDonalds, of all places, found out the hard way that Americans didn't understand this exact skill when they introduced their 1/3 pound burger. The product failed because most people thought that they were getting less meat at a higher price because 1/4 has to be bigger than 1/3 since 4 is larger than 3.

"Quick clarification-- Participants are not being left alone the whole 33 days with no human interaction. They are visited by a nurse, MD, and study team member every day, and a psychologist at least once during the study. There are research technicians going in and out of the room many times each day, and sometimes dedicated staff who will just sit in the room and chat/play games as requested to keep participants company. We also encourage participants to bring non-electronic activities/hobbies (e.g. instruments, books, knitting, cross-stitch, origami, puzzles, art supplies, etc); we have a dvd player and CD player and a large collection of DVDs/CDs so they can watch movies/prerecorded TV shows or listen to music, and they can also bring their own DVDs and CDs if they have any (although obviously few people do these days). While they aren't allowed a phone, they can write letters which we will mail for them, and they can also receive letters if they give their friends/family the hospital mailing address.

Despite being out of uniform, not initially identifying themselves as an officer, and introducing themselves by waking me up with a gun and demanding my phone (I was sleeping in the passenger's side at the time the other car took the photo). 

It's like I needed to be thankful for not randomly being blown away because someone else I never met did something wrong as I was unconscious.

It honestly feelt that she lost it and was just looking for an excuse to blow someone away.

No good at home
He walked the streets a soldier
And he fought the world alone and now it's

"I drive an old Corolla, work night shift, drive safely. I would get pulled over several times a year unfairly. Rude, menacing, always having to be right and dominant, trying to set you up. That is state police for you. Sure, sometimes I would be at fault and let go without at ticket for expired inspection sticker or a dead light bulb.. but I am a safe driver, not a drug or alcohol user, not a criminal. The point is they stop people and then they have to be right no matter what (not that I argue or talk to them much). So yes, this is normal to some people who they choose to pull over based on vehicle age and type, time and location. Police are VERY corrupt and commit crime themselves.

One time a state obviously needed to write someone a written warning to get his quota, even though his own cruiser had a dead light bulb. I was merging into an empty highway at midnight while it was raining slightly and he gave me a warning for driving below 45 mph, even though I was driving 47 mph and his words were 'you are driving like 45 mph.' He drove behind me with his one light bulb, drove on my side, stopped me, wrote the warning and drove away. I tried to tell him it was raining, but now that arguing with police can lead to them being dominant by committing fraud and crime against you. They are our overlords and we live in a sort of police state for people who are unlucky to be picked as their target. I left a message to the state police saying writing a warning to people who reduce speed during rain like it is recommended is the wrong message and the guy's cruiser has a light bulb out.. I bet they just put me on a 'harassment list' by adding a secret note to my database profile and did nothing to the guy.. another time a trooper used his siren instead of his lights to make me look more guilty and then did not let me go but started ordering me to drive away hoping I would mess up and he would accuse me of non compliance. He kept saying 'you are not an emergency vehicle' because I put on my hazard lights on during a snow storm to alert drivers not to tail gate me. These guys and their bosses commit money fraud, protect drug dealers, abuse and harass drivers to fill quotas and fail to maintain the posted driving speed on the highways, harass each other, keep blacks, asians and hispanics and women out of their job, lie in police logs, frame people, extort females for sex, abuse kids, extort businesses, get kick backs from tow companies, etc. Police do not have to be correct, don't have to know or follow the law, can accuse anybody, can escalate and arrest anybody as long as they pretend to be doing or thinking something, their contract forbids them from being punished, they get a free lawyer from the union, they are not questioned or cross examined, they keep their jobs even if they did something bad as long as other officers did the same bad thing without being punished, they have extra rights including the right to commit a crime written in the national Police Bill of Rights, and they cannot be sued personally unless an officer has been convicted for the same exact thing in the passed called qualified immunity, they do not have a duty to protect anyone if they do not want to, while they can enforce any law to any extent they want to which means they can exaggerate and misinterpret things and punish someone unfairly without any consequences for them, their supervisors are sergeants who are promoted because they have themselves committed crimes and indiscretions so that they are trusted to protect their guilty coworkers, the police chiefs commit all kinds of fraud and corruption and enforce a gang like enforcement in the team they oversee, the governor gets benefits from the state police while all politicians in the legislature and state government live under threat of being followed and framed by state police or be bad mouthed in the media by either the police chiefs or the police union boss.. many cases of police union bosses being child molesters, embezzling money, etc.. in Boston Police the domestic violence cops were forbidden from arresting or charging Boston Police officers when they committed violent crimes of domestic violence.. think about that.. wife calls the cops on her husband but they say sorry we are not allowed to arrest officers, deal with it yourself.",t2_k0lr992z,Fun_Yak_924,0,1648964706.0,0,t1_i36xcsy,i36xcsy,True,[deleted],t3_tuqa8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tuqa8w/pulled_over_by_statie_because_i_was_the_only_car/,"Pulled over by Statie because I was the only car yielding to his flashing lights.

"Some of these points seem a little dramatic IMO. They always explained to us that these tests didn't count for your grade, and struggled to even make kids take it seriously.

"Ay, this is Shaws/Albertsons isn't it? Been working there for four+ years now. If it's Rob doing this he can go screw himself.

Call up the Labor Board and ask them about the full/part time distinction. If you're listed as part time and they keep giving you these hours, report them for fraud. Literally the only way you'll get the morons who handle the schedule to actually stop this shit. Everyone in this company is either incompetent or incapable of fixing their act. You'll get your backpay due to benefits not provided, and then you can demand that you are actually given part time hours. If they try to get rid of you, tada you just got your college paid off. :)

Note: IANAL

Edit: You mentioned in another comment that you don't know how to find your average weekly time. Take the last paystub of the year, take the total year hours, divide that by 52 weeks (if you worked the entire year), that's your average. If you worked less than the entire year, take your first paystub, find what week of the year that was, subtract that from 52, then divided your year total hours by that.

>But the so-called welfare queen was real. Her name was Linda Taylor, and she indeed owned a Cadillac, and several other cars, at the time she was arrested in 1974. She was a mixed-race woman who often told authorities she was white, Mexican or Hawaiian, according to Josh Levin, author of the new biography “The Queen: The Forgotten Life Behind an American Myth.”  
>  
>Levin portrays Taylor as a lifelong con artist and thief who may have committed far more serious crimes, including kidnapping and murder  
>  
>Linda Taylor was born Martha Louise White in 1926 in Golddust, Tenn., the result of her white mother’s affair with a black man. Though she was light-skinned, she was forbidden to go to the local white school. In 1940, at the age of 13 or 14, she had her first child.  
>  
>Still in her teens, Taylor was arrested in 1943 in Seattle for disorderly conduct under the name Martha Davis. Thus began a dizzying trail of arrests, aliases, marriages and cross-state moves, painstakingly detailed by Levin.  
>  
>In 1944, she was arrested for vagrancy as “Martha Gordon” in Port Orchard, Wash.; in 1945, malicious mischief as “Connie Reed” in Oakland, Calif.; in 1946, suspicion of prostitution as “Betty Smith” in Oakland.  
>  
>In 1948, while “passing” as white, she married a Navy sailor named Paul Harbaugh. She had three more children in this period, one of whom had a darker complexion than the others. The marriage quickly unraveled.  
>  
>In 1952, she married a drifter named Troy “Buddy” Elliott in Arkansas and had a fifth child. But Elliott’s family rejected her and her darker-skinned son, whom she eventually abandoned.  
>  
>In 1959, Taylor, as “Connie Harbaugh,” filed a lawsuit in Peoria, Ill., alleging her children had been severely injured in a gas explosion at their school. The case was thrown out seven years later.  
>  
>Taylor first made news in 1964, in Chicago, when she claimed to be the daughter of Lawrence Wakefield, a black man who, upon his death, was found to have more than $760,000 in cash in his home, a fortune earned in an underground gambling business. As “Constance Wakefield,” she sued to be named Wakefield’s sole heir. Her uncle and grandmother were flown in to testify against her.  
>  
>The case that made her famous began in August 1974 when she called in a false burglary report to the Chicago Police Department. Officer Jack Sherwin didn’t believe her story and started poking around, eventually figuring out that she had a warrant in Michigan under the name Connie Green. When he arrested her, he found a cache of public aid identification cards under a variety of names. Writing his report on her myriad schemes, he called her by the name he guessed was right: Linda Taylor.",t2_j5mwqc4b,LooseMovement,0,1648930675.0,0,t1_i35a7fy,i35a7fy,False,wgsl,t3_tuh70y,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/tuh70y/identity_imposters_collecting_mass_public/,Identity imposters collecting Mass. public benefits - WCVB 5,/r/massachusetts/comments/tuh70y/identity_imposters_collecting_mass_public/i35a7fy/,2,r/massachusetts,0,2

No windows in the room for over a month, being sleep deprived and not knowing what time it is, no ability to speak with family etc. It’s literally worse than old-school prison experiments. I really fail to see how a risk/benefit analysis could have possibly led to approval here. There is absolutely no benefit to participants (other than the financial coercion… what situation would someone have to be in to agree to this?) and difficult to see how this would be helpful to humanity (what groups of people get zero natural light and experience sleep deprivation while not knowing whether it’s even night or day?).

"Hello, social equity candidate here 👋🏽. There's a couple reasons why there are no cafe's yet. There are 2 license types that are currently exclusive to social equity license holders: delivery & social consumption. The main reason why we don't have them yet is due to this restriction, big money is wary to invest large sums of capital because - 

1. As a social equity license holder, the CCC requires that the social equity candidate maintain a 51% controlling stake in the company

2. Many social equity candidates by definition are not wealthy and have no track record of running successful businesses, let alone businesses that handle millions of dollars

The CCC has royally screwed up the dynamic of their own program, albeit with good intentions. This is not an attractive scenario for investors. However the clock is ticking on the exclusivity period, with 2 of the 3 years left on the clock. The firms holding all the capital are more than willing to wait out the poors and either buy out operational businesses in 2025 or fund their own licensing efforts and set up their own businesses without having to involve social equity license holders. The only advantage the SE program affords the big money is being first to market.

Not to mention the state still handles cannabis like it's radioactive. The security measures alone are cost prohibitive to potential small businesses. Not only that, every one of your future employees must be certified by the state to work in the cannabis industry. Imagine paying the state $100+ to get certified for a $15/hr bud tender or delivery driver job. All while this plant is still federally illegal.

I thought about opening a cannabis cafe that would encourage smoking (not even sell) but there’s too many barriers to entry and I don’t have the money to be the guinea pig. I then moved on to opening a private club thinking it would be less restrictive for indoor smoking but they too have some hard rules that would limit the income avenues.

"Yup, we’ve already had our property treated because our 9 year old got Lyme disease last year from playing in the yard. I have seen ticks on my dog that were soooo small I needed to take a photo first, and then pinch and zoom to see the legs to confirm it was indeed a tick! ( that’s the type of tick I believe got my daughter because I check the kids religiously) We’ve got a sorresto flea collar from the vet because the topical frontline was not enough for our dog.  I would add that our dog has been vaccinated against Lyme but they are still the perfect host for parasites and ticks often carry other nasty diseases too!!  The ticks in Massachusetts are bad, stay vigilant people :)

Edit to add that Lyme made our daughter extremely ill and the pediatrician didn’t test for it- kept saying it was “a virus”.  The only reason she was treated was because she got the bulls eye rash on her 9 th day of fever. I thank god she got the rash or she wouldn’t have received proper treatment.  Most people DO NOT get the bulls eye rash!

"Marijuana definitely hurts your reaction time, your coordination, and your judgement. It is very dangerous to drive with THC in your system, and also people with THC in their system are very bad at determining how impaired they are.

This is also related to the biggest difference - which is that impairment from THC doesn't correlated to the time when you have the most THC in your blood, like it does with alcohol, and it doesn't go away as the immediate surge of THC leaves your system. You stay roughly equally impaired from THC from hours after you get it in your system, even as the observable concentration drops.

It's a real challenge for figuring out how to deal with stoned driving, and the numbers are suggesting it is legit dangerous.",t2_4h01e,GyantSpyder,0,1648859815.0,0,t1_i31xat6,i31xat6,False,Next-Bullfrog-1624,t3_ttthhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/ttthhr/why_doesnt_massachusetts_have_cannabis_cafes/,Why doesn’t Massachusetts have cannabis cafes?,/r/massachusetts/comments/ttthhr/why_doesnt_massachusetts_have_cannabis_cafes/i31xat6/,0,r/massachusetts,0,0

"Rent first for 6 months. Get a lay of the land. Scope out the neighborhoods, save your cash, then execute on something within your parameters. The best neighborhood is Belvidere, but it's essentially untouchable for you at this time. Avoid the Acre. Highlands and Centralville are OK, but there are bad pockets. Try to get something near the highway on ramp and not over the water. If your goal is rental, seek something near UML.

"I think you may want to ask for roundabouts and not rotaries. Roundabouts are smaller and much safer than rotaries. 

From my experience the easiest thing to do to get the Town to upgrade them is to call your councilor or selectman. If enough people call them/write letters they will make the town engineer fix the issues. There are ways to get funding through the State. Chapter 90 funding is typically used by towns to plow the snow and resurface some roads. It is not a lot of money
