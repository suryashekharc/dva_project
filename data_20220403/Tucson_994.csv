"Hi there, 

I‚Äôm here in the Gila wilderness of NM and I make a living my teaching various traditional and earth based living skills. My wife and I lived essentially off the land for almost a decade in our tipi and have made our living teaching survival and nature skills. One of the things we will be offering next year is a basic ‚Äòhow to hunt‚Äô course going through the basics of hunting tactics for each type of game
Animal in our area.  
It can be a tough learning curve if you don‚Äôt have some sort of mentor as these types of things
Don‚Äôt exactly come as second nature. 

In the meantime you should check out the Wintercount Camp gathering.  We teach there every year and know many of the instructors. It‚Äôs a great place to start learning basic tracking, animal behavior, and you could even build your own bow, knap a few stone points, and straighten a few arrows. 

You will have to complete a hunter safety course with the state to get a basic hunting license and then you could apply for tags. 

If you could pull a AZ tag for a javelina that would be a great place to start. Super easy hunting and you could get the hang of using your firearm in the field. 

Hit me up on Instagram and we could be in touch on future classes or I could at least direct you to someone who is holding something similar sooner.

"Yes, unfortunately most of us seem to auto check everything to cast a large net. That being said, a competent therapist should have multiple skill sets for treating a variety of problems. If they seem to be applying a general template to all their patients no matter to presenting problem, then you should move on to another one.

I totally understand the frustration with having to start over with someone new. It is a little like dating, which brings me to a suggestion. I would request a short screening phone call with a potential therapist. Ask them questions about style, methods, etc. Any decent provider will gladly do this gratis, then you can narrow down your options. Heck, I would ask to do this even with folks you aren‚Äôt sure are a match based on the profile, we don‚Äôt exactly get training on selling ourselves in school.

"I water my plants from above and let them sit in ~1/4‚Äù of water and water again after it has dried up for 1 or two days. They like to stay wet but will suffer from rot if their roots go anaerobic so the water needs to be very shallow or well aerated. The live sphagnum moss serves as a good indicator of the moisture level, if the tips start to dry you know it‚Äôs time to water again. The moss establishes in the pot much more quickly in high humidity, but once it‚Äôs established it‚Äôs handles low humidity just fine. The growth habit changes to be a bit more compact in low humidity.

If you‚Äôre interested in trying these plants out it is a good idea to get a reverse osmosis system. Our water is extremely hard here, over 400 ppm TDS sometimes, and they prefer water under 50 ppm. Rainwater is great but unless you‚Äôve got a rainwater harvesting system on your house it‚Äôs hard to collect enough living here.

Edit: I forgot to mention, I don‚Äôt have any windows bright enough for Heliamphora so I grow under lights. It might be difficult to get them through our summers growing in a windowsill.

"The reason blueberries do not grow well in our soil is because they prefer acidic soil rather than the alkaline soil here. You can try growing them in pots, but you will need to do research on an acid-rich mix. Additionally, our water is alkaline so you will be fighting the water chemistry. Plants that are known to do well here: figs, blackberries, raspberries, mulberries (""Pakistan"" variety has incredible flavor and huge berries), peaches, apricots. Some plants that are supposed to be similar in flavor to blueberries, but tolerate alkaline soil are becoming very popular in the north called ""Haskaps"" or ""Honeyberry"". You will need to acquire 2 plants that can cross-pollinate. Apple trees - get one that requires low chill hours. Other edible plants that do well here: roselle hibiscus, basil, mexican elderberry (flowers and berries are both good for wildlife, berries are good for cooking). There are multiple types of edible cactus including Peruvian apple cactus. If you're interested in more traditional/annual plants - I get seeds from both Native Seed Search (local) or Baker Creek Rare Seeds. I'm sure I've forgotten a lot of things.

Replacement will be anywhere from $4k to $20k.
Rotorrootering will be under $200 (you may have to do this 1x/year). If you can identify the tree that has penetrated it you can just remove the tree for under $2000 if you shop around (maybe even less). As an alternative to rootering it, there are hydrojetting services that will run $500 to $700 (but they will only do it if you have a cleanout pipe available.

"I suppose it mostly depends on your preference.  Do you want actual soft water that reduces the amount of soap you need to wash clothes, etc. as well as reducing the amount of mineral buildup in appliances and on countertops?  Or do you just want to reduce the mineral buildup and don't care about actual water softness?

Personally, I don't like the feeling of soft water.  I don't like the slippery feeling and I want my water to *feel* hard but I don't want the mineral buildup.  So a TAC conditioner is perfect for me.  Minerals still collect on surfaces, but they don't bond so they're easy to wipe up.

Water conditioners don't last forever, though and need to be serviced/replaced every 5 years or so.  But it's probably on par with the cost of buying bags of salt every month.  Also, buying salt and carrying 50lb bags around is a pain in the ass.  But maybe you don't mind.

"Here is one nobody has named yet, well two kinda. One is Bob Nolan. One of the great country song writers of all time, his big hit being Cool Water. He was in the Sons of the Pioneers, a legendarily huge mega band. Also performing with the Sons of the Pioneers was Rex Allen who grew up on a ranch outside of Wilcox, not far from here either. These guys are legend status just way before our time. Both became famous actor musicians, Rex obviously being the more famous of the two. Pretty sure both are in the country western hall of fame.

When it's 110 degrees out, Cool Water still hits!

Ok one more kinda Tucson. Stan Jones who wrote the greatest country western songs ever, Ghostriders in the Sky. He claimed the story was told to him by a native american elder when he was a young boy growing up and working on a ranch in Cochise County near Douglas, and he turned it into a song as he got older and wrote campfire music. Another cool regional music story and another legendary country song with southern AZ roots. This song has been voted the greatest Country Western song ever written. Think about that.

"It depends on if you have a home that is already properly pre-plumbed for a water softener. If it is, then the outside faucets are already bypassed in most cases.

As for wasting water, the system I have (Morton 45C) will use between 4 gallons and 40 gallons of water to clean the system out when it regenerates. However, regeneration is demand-based, so it will only kick in when a certain number of gallons of softened water pass through it. Older softeners would run on a schedule and blindly regenerate based off that schedule regardless how much water you used.

I do remember that well over 1,000 gallons have to pass through before mine regenerates, so very worst case, if you're regenerating ever 1,000 gallons at the highest salt level of 40 gallons, it's wasting 1 gallon out of every 25.   
However, I think mine uses around 8 gallons of water every 4,000, so 1 gallon out of 500 is wasted.

In the end, I don't think water softeners are the reason Tucson will have a problem with water.

"I did soft water installs for a company based in California for several years. You are correct that salt based is true soft water. Our residential units would put 40 to 50 gallons of water down the drain per regeneration cycle. Depending on the size of the unit and how many grains of hardness the water is determines how many gallons of soft water you get before the unit needs to regenerate. 
Our unit that was called a 1000 had a cubic foot of resin and would generally do 1000 gallons of soft water before a regeneration. We would measure the hardness and set the unit to regenerate at say 900 gallons if the water was fairly hard in that area to insure the customer didn't run out of soft water before the regeneration cycle. 

As for watering plants we would install a ""hard"" hose bib at the unit for watering plants and such if the customer wanted. That way you aren't wasting soft water on plants. As long as your plants are fertilized soft water won't hurt them. Calcium and magnesium are the main things removed with a softener. We also installed a soft bibs at the unit which is nice for washing your cars.

"Welcome. I tried to remain positive when I moved here for my ex's job and tried looking for work in my field. I couldn't find work that paid commensurate to my experience. Every employer wants 3 jobs descriptions rolled into one position. It's impossible to be efficient when you are overworked from the start. For example, my degree and area of expertise is public relations (writing). Yet most employers are really.looking for a public affairs (public speaker) person or they want you to do both. Some even add in advertising and marketing. All these are degree specific and separate jobs.

I've yet to find a job by going to the mega sites and applying through Indeed, etc. I probably don't meet the algorithm for the website and my resume is immediately culled before it can reach an employer. I've even reached out to recruiters to get tips on how to get further in the process. I'm working part time in a completely unrelated field.
