I lived on Stow St (up near exit 26 of I95) for thirteen years and although we heard reports of some crime in the city (most memorably (1) arson on a construction site downtown and (2) a series of violent muggings of men a couple of years ago - they caught the second guy, not sure about the first) we never experienced any crime or knew anyone who did.

"Feel free to DM with any more specific questions!  Once again, I don't want to discount the experiences from others who are reporting problems they've had.  As I said, I'm just one person who happens to have never experienced a really bad issue (either property crime or violent crime) in all my time here.  But the folks who know people who have had a car stolen are valid, too.   (I wouldn't say that Waltham was particularly known as a place cars frequently get stolen, I think?)

And as one of the people below is relating: you're probably better off if you can get a place a bit off of Moody Street.  It's a GREAT restaurant/bar scene, but as they were saying, the bars create their own problems.

The other thing I would suggest is trying to find a place with off-street parking if you can.  I do think it helps keep your car a little bit safer.  (Although another commenter said a car got stolen out of their driveway! So you never know.)  But the main reason to look for that is: snow emergencies.  If you have only street parking, there may be times in the winter when there is a declared snow emergency, and you must move your car off the street.  You can park it in one of the municipal lots (of which there are a bunch in the area), but then you do have to dig it out and get it out of there fairly quickly).  For those first 11 years here, I had only on-street parking, and it was such a pain.  It's super worth it to not have to worry about having to move your car, where to move it, etc.",t2_29yeuei5,eregyrn,0,1648740527.0,0,t1_i2uwtd7,i2uwtd7,False,dj_notmac,t3_tsod36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/,Moving to Waltham? - Areas off Moody St.,/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/i2uwtd7/,3,r/Waltham,0,3

"Yes, the boarding house on Walnut was the one I used to live near, and the one that was subjected to the drive-by shooting in... hmm, 2003 or so?  I don't know whether the one on Adams is regarded as more ""reputable"" or not. (I don't even know whether the one on Walnut has an improved reputation now!)

And yes, I should have been clearer -- NO students live in the boarding houses!  But students from Brandeis and Bentley (graduate students primarily) do live in this general South Side area of Waltham.  Or, they used to!  (When I first moved here, it was with my partner who was a grad student at Brandeis, and that's where we found housing.  But that was in like '91, and I'm not sure what is regarded as the best student housing areas today.)",t2_29yeuei5,eregyrn,0,1648739526.0,0,t1_i2uu8q6,i2uu8q6,False,dj_notmac,t3_tsod36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/,Moving to Waltham? - Areas off Moody St.,/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/i2uu8q6/,2,r/Waltham,0,2
"Yes, exactly!  I found all of that really odd too. I think part of it is that it breaks down along lines of property crime, vs violent crime.  The map allows you to toggle between those, and when you toggle to violent crime, a lot of the red areas go away (although there are still some orange-ish areas).  But on the ""overall"" map it shows up more red because of that property crime portion.

That whole big red area near Lincoln is a lot of office parks and businesses.  And if you scroll way down (past the maps) on that page, it talks about the statistics a bit, and it does mention that in some of the red property crime areas, it's more businesses getting hit than private property.

I also had to wonder: what are the criteria for defining the various ""areas""?  Like, that huge red area, what defines that as an area?  It may be that there are only like, 6 property crimes per year in that entire area, but there's no ""hot spots"", it just colors the entire area red.  (I wish it was more of a ""heat map"" than just coloring big areas like it does.)

The same thing happens with the ""violent crime"" map.  Toggle that, and there's a huge area in Weston that is very orange, (which is the worst it also gets in the Waltham area), and that makes me wonder -- so like, is that basically one or two violent crimes in that area, skewing the numbers?  Because again, it's hard to believe that that area of Weston is ""more dangerous"" than most of Waltham!  Similarly, when you zoom out, there is an actual red area around Park Circle in Arlington, which I know is a pretty ""good"" (expensive) neighborhood, but it's the darkest red area outside of the real cities.  Is that like, 1 murder that happened there, or something?  (There's another deep-orange area in the middle of Lexington, which again I find surprising.)  

And I think if you asked most people, they'd say that Weston and Lexington (Arlington too) were ""safer"" places to live than Waltham, overall!  At least by perception.  

So that tells me that a map like this has to be taken with some grain of salt.  Is there crime?  Yeah.  But don't necessarily let the deep red colors alarm you TOO much.  Maybe use those to try to dig further into actual crime records for those areas to see what triggers those colors. 

(I should note of course that I don't know that OP was using that same website. It's just what I found when I googled Waltham crime map.)",t2_29yeuei5,eregyrn,0,1648739117.0,0,t1_i2ut7n0,i2ut7n0,False,dj_notmac,t3_tsod36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/,Moving to Waltham? - Areas off Moody St.,/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/i2ut7n0/,4,r/Waltham,0,4

"I currently live about 4 houses off Moody near Ash St, and have since 2017. 

Honestly, there are times I want a little more space, but otherwise I really like this neighborhood. It's diverse, the people are interesting and kind overall, it's convenient to many things, and it's relatively quiet given the level of convenience to loud areas. 

Sometimes we get some noise from Moody, but usually it's not bad at all, even though we live near Franco's. The worst for me are honestly the guys who zoom by super loudly in their souped up cars a couple of times a week.

I walk our dog alone at night (I'm female) and have had zero problems. Before the dog, I still had no problem walking alone at night. 

The worst thing that has happened in 5 years was the house next door had a car stolen out of their driveway in the middle of the night, so we installed a doorbell camera to overlook our own driveway for safety. 

I really recommend having assigned spots or private parking for sanity reasons. Having to park on the street every day would be stressful. 

The location can't be beat in terms of convenience. It's a short walk to the main Moody strip, we're right near the river walkways, and it's a short drive to our pharmacy and preferred grocery store. There's an excellent optometrist on Moody and several walkable dentist options. 

So personally? I think it's great here. It's not everyone's speed. It's definitely a little more rundown than most other areas of Waltham, and it feels more urban. But it has its pros and cons like every other neighborhood.

"We were admittedly right on Moody, so perhaps we experienced the worst of the area. Loud, drunk people were a constant at night. There were drunk people often during the day, too, and we had our fair share of run-ins with intoxicated folks enjoying our property as their own, and approaching us as we came and went, some aggressively. Drunk people were constantly throwing stuff at our house and onto our property.

Drugs in our area were a real problem, including finding passed-out folks on our driveway, as well drug paraphernalia.

Our dedicated parking spots were communal, despite our best efforts.

We had some exterior cameras installed, and the police would very regularly request footage from us for a variety of things we caught on camera without even knowing.

Rats were a real problem; regardless of what we did individually, our neighbors didn’t, and that was enough to keep them around.

It was a much bigger headache than it was worth. Any benefit we gained from our proximity to the restaurants and other amenities were easily overshadowed. We’ve lived in city settings for much of our adult lives, and no other place was as bad as Moody St. We left as soon as jobs allowed.",t2_8ij1q,EJS1127,0,1648705339.0,0,t1_i2tc2r0,i2tc2r0,False,dj_notmac,t3_tsod36,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/,Moving to Waltham? - Areas off Moody St.,/r/Waltham/comments/tsod36/moving_to_waltham_areas_off_moody_st/i2tc2r0/,2,r/Waltham,0,2

"I guess a lot depends on your exact location!  I've basically lived 2 blocks off of Moody for the past 30 years. For 11 years I was on the west side of Moody, near Crescent.  For the past almost 20, I've been on the east side of Moody, approx in the area you're describing.

The first location I lived in, I lived across the street from a boarding house, and there were a lot of students (from Brandeis and from Bentley).  But that's almost 20 years ago.  ONCE, not long before I moved from that building, there was a drive-by shooting in the middle of the night (car drove by and shot at the boarding house). That was literally the only criminal activity we ever saw there.

On the east side of Moody, I have never had any problems.  Knock on wood, of course!  One person's anecdotal evidence isn't as valuable as statistics.  I do have off-street parking.  It's a diverse neighborhood.  I'd generally say I like this area.  Lots of interesting stuff to walk to. Not a far drive from a choice of various supermarkets and stuff.  Have never at all felt unsafe walking anywhere in Waltham in daylight.  At night can feel a little iffy sometimes, depending on how low-traffic the area is.

I guess I'd say that the busier the street you live on, with more traffic, the safer it will probably be?  But who knows.

I'm looking at the crime map from [crimegrade.org](https://crimegrade.org) (never seen that before!), and it does look like I just happen to live in a greener area -- not the A+ dark green, but A level, perhaps.  The place I used to live is more shaded C-D level.   It does look like the area around Ash Street, from Moody to Lowell (and beyond to Newton St), on the east side of Moody, is better-rated than west of Moody.  That area bounded by Lowell, High, Robbins and Parmenter looks like the best bet around South Side.

"Waltham is more of a suburban area with high traffic, there are some spots that are good and others that are not. I have lived in the central area close to Main Street/Moody St. since 2018.
Main Street can get pretty busy with vehicle traffic. Moody St is good for dining. If you’re here during the outdoor dining you should be able to have freedom to move about without feeling impaired, they open the entire street. 
I also moved from a smaller town in Florida, it’s a bit of a culture shock if I will be completely honest. I only came here since my boyfriend attends Bentley University nearby. 
I’ve been itching to leave if I will be even more honest though. Knowing we could get a an actual home (like 4 beds, 3 baths compared to our 1bed 1 bath apartment) cheaper elsewhere and we dump a ton of money on rent, you don’t really get what you pay for here. They upped our rent to $3500 since we signed a half year lease to get all of our ducks in a row for the move. 

Traffic can get unbearable at times, (especially before the pandemic started, it was awful.) and the roads are very poorly taken care of. There’s a foot deep pothole near the market basket that has been there for a week now. I’ve had to have my car realigned twice. So beware while driving. Also the drivers here are not the best, there are the few that are actual maniacs and do not care if they cut you off, even if you have right of way. You will learn the term “Masshole” very fast. I technically had to teach myself how to drive again when I moved here. 
The public transportation system here is old but not too bad, expect delays sometimes. Our transit train the goes into Boston is good and has a ramp for ease of access for handicapped access. It runs right between Moody and Main. Takes about 20-30 minutes to get into Boston. 
If you stay here in Waltham and have one of the Section 8 houses I know you will be good, if you ever have any questions or concerns you can always DM Me, I will be in the area until mid July. I’ll give you pointers! Even after that you can always still ask me anything if needed.
I hope your move goes smoothly! Your nervousness and uncertainty is valid, I was in your boat once and completely understand how you feel. :)",t2_2229fjb5,renkurai,0,1648572041.0,0,t1_i2l0w11,i2l0w11,False,Fi-115,t3_tgiezg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tgiezg/moody_st_closure_for_2022_has_passed/,Moody St. Closure for 2022 has passed!,/r/Waltham/comments/tgiezg/moody_st_closure_for_2022_has_passed/i2l0w11/,2,r/Waltham,0,2

"I'm not sure if/where it has been done here yet. I've only been in Waltham for two and half years. I just got super deep in an ADHD wormhole about forest/urban tree monoculture at one point years ago after learning about how the White Mountain National Forest was basically clear cut at one point. It's been a weird interest ever since. 

I just wanted to drop some explanations about why this isn't necessarily a bad move, and could end up being a significant improvement long term. I highly suggest going to the public hearing about it and asking questions so we can keep our politicians to their promises. 

Also as a sidenote. Waltham has a TreeKeeper site where you can look up all sorts of stats on the tree inventory in within the city. You can look up trees to find out their diameter, find the largest trees in the city, read comments about issues with certain trees. I think it's super cool lol. I'm super interested in finding out what kind of pace that project is moving at. Some trees have comments dating back to 2017 that don't seem to have been updated, but the tracker website is new as of this year I guess.

"You can't fix a buckled side walk without cutting out the root system that is buckling the sidewalk.... Cutting out that root system kills the tree... How else do you think they fix a sidewalk that is raised a full foot above level?

As for ""actively cleaning air from car pollution"" that's not really true. On a large scale, yes, trees clean air. But on a local level in cities, trees can, and do, restrict airflow which can trap automobile pollutants closer to the ground. Same goes for bushes/hedges/overgrowth against roadways. Most trees aren't that good at catching small particulate pollution. We can, and should, plant trees that are better suited to catching automobile pollutants. And even more importantly, monoculture environments of trees in an urban area or a forest can have serious consequences from tree illnesses like destructive fungi or in asive bugs like longhorn beetles. When all the trees in a given area are the same species, it becomes much easier for problems to spread (read: Worcester having to cull 35,000 trees to try and contain an Asian longhorn beetle infestation). Citations below for all of that if you're interested.

But overall, you're acting like I'm advocating for the permanent removal of these trees, or that the city didn't explicitly explain that they would replace them lol. The trees in question are invasive with aggressive root systems that aren't compatible with city sidewalks, utilities, or people's foundations. They're a result of poor urban planning from a time where we just slapped trees down without any thought, and they are currently holding up road/sidewalk construction. They should be removed, and replaced with trees that are better suited for their specific environment, based on the MASSIVE gains in knowledge we've made when it comes to green urban planning. 

Like.. I'm all for more trees.. just plant better trees.

"Honestly I support this with or without sidewalk work because its invasive to North America. They grow *extensive* root systems- most of which is spread out close to the topsoil (as opposed to a taproot, which largely grows straight down. Those spread out, shallow root systems are a headache all around. 

They’re extremely vigorous and tend to take the majority of nutrients available, plus as the roots mature they thicken and it’ll disrupt concrete if it needs to as it grows. This makes it really really hard for other plants to grow in the same area. Additionally, they have large thick canopies that also discourage understory growth. 

Finally, herbivores just don’t like them as much and it gives the norway maples a competitive advantage over native trees.

"I am. I’ll wait to see what the law department drafts. I don’t believe a city can prevent a single family homeowner from renting their property as long as it is rented as a single unit. To specify what that housing unit looks like opens up an opportunity to discriminate and enforce the ordinance in an arbitrary manner. I have been involved with harassment directed at minority tenants because neighbors didn’t like these people. In most cases, the city came down on the side of tenants only after I argued in their favor. I don’t know what would happen if a property owner didn’t side with the tenants and just wanted to placate neighbors. Many times neighbors don’t get along and tenants as opposed to home owners are easy targets. As I said, I’ll wait to see the proposed ordinance. This issue of renting to students has been an issue in Waltham for as long as I can remember. I don’t see how you can control the number of occupants simply by saying one person to a bedroom. Fact is, sooner or later, individuals will invite partners to cohabitate resulting in more than one person in a bedroom. Should be an interesting issue. I personally don’t rent to students for a variety of reasons although I have in the past. I rent exclusively to families and I can tell you, almost all are under housed.

"Astroturfing is when a state or national organization, usually with paid employees, pushes a political agenda but makes it appear to be grassroots-- that is, it appears that unrelated people in different communities are raising it at their local meetings. When this happens, the people raising the issue usually don't represent the majority opinion of the town, but they may get a lot of attention due to unusual antics, or the fact that they are showing up to a meeting that usually does not attract members of the public.

The best example of astroturfing on this diagram is Mass Against Mandates. This is a statewide group that set out to fight mask and vaccine mandates, but instead of presenting themselves as a statewide group, they created a Facebook group for each city and town in MA, then recruited local admins. At the Waltham School Committee meeting about masks there were local parents who spoke for and against masks, but there were more who spoke in favor. There were five people who were not from Waltham who entered the meeting without masks, several were being disruptive, and one of them was kicked out. If someone had not researched this afterward, it might have appeared that these folks represented a portion of our community. But someone found a video they posted online in which they said they had been asked to be there by Mass Against Mandates.

The recent attempt to ban LGBTQ books in Waltham is also an example of national and state groups drawing a lot of attention to an issue in our community, even though most people in our community do not consider it an issue. A paid employee of MA Family Institute, which is funded by national groups, started a Facebook group in which she promotes the idea that LGBTQ-inclusive content in schools is intended to ""groom"" students for sexual assault. Local parents such as Mrs. Arena then raise objections to content in their towns, so it appears to be coming from a local grassroots movement instead of the same orgs that have attacked LGBTQ people for decades.

Mrs. Arena's connection to SHFA may not be an example of astroturfing per se, but it's included in this network map because it's important to understanding Mrs. Arena's position on the book bans. She has repeatedly said that she is not anti-LGBTQ, she just feels the books are too explicit for teenagers. But she's also used the term ""grooming"" in discussing the books and has chosen to connect herself to some of the most notorious queerphobes in the state, and one of them built her campaign website.

The top row is national groups, the next two rows are state groups, and the third row is local. So ""White Nationalists"" are above ""SHFA"" to make the point that they are part of a dangerous national network.

The main point is that in MA, when we hear about bigotry or far-right activity, we tend to assume it is happening somewhere else. But state and national movements that may not seem to be well-established here have ways of influencing our politics that can be very effective if not enough people are showing up or getting involved in local meetings. So although most of us don't think of Waltham as a bigoted community, our politics can become bigoted if we don't pay attention.",t2_j16idnxi,macabeeI95,0,1647972920.0,0,t1_i1owuiw,i1owuiw,False,macabeeI95,t3_tid3qg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tid3qg/how_the_right_astroturfs_your_local_school/,How the Right Astroturfs Your Local School Committee Meeting: A Waltham Example,/r/Waltham/comments/tid3qg/how_the_right_astroturfs_your_local_school/i1owuiw/,4,r/Waltham,0,4

WWN is always jokey! WWN takes everything seriously!

WWN would not exist if both were not simultaneously true! WWN is a qubit! It is both funny and not funny, both lighthearted and deadly serious! At the same time! Unlike a qubit, measuring WWN does not determine our quantum state!  
  
The internet thinks George Bernard Shaw said ""Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh""! The internet also believes he said ""My way of joking is to tell the truth. It's the funniest joke in the world""! He also might have said ""When a thing is funny, search it carefully for a hidden truth""! We didn't realize how much we love George Bernard Shaw until the internet told us to dance with him!  ❤️💃🏽🕺🏽  
  
We also point to our short duration personal savior, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy! It is no surprise to us that his professional training as an entertainer and comedian provided the ideal experience to be exactly the leader he needed to be at the moment his country needed that leader!

"I thought the comment in the video about this part was condescending. It was mocking the councilor for his lack of knowledge and trying to ask questions to become more informed about it.

There's a reason to ask about the length of time an edible takes to ""kick in"" (e.g. on ""average"" alcohol takes a half-hour to kick in). Asking the question helps the councilor decide if it is worth considering. The lawyer does explain the issue in a knowledgeable way during the questions, which provides the information the councilor needed. It made the question's concern seem unnecessary. It was answered well and respectfully.

Asking questions to gather more information is an important aspect of any learning. The purpose of a hearing is to ask questions - sometimes questions you know the answer to. Mocking someone for trying to learn comes off superior and unkind. 

As for mocking his lack of edible use, it could mean a hundred things from he is a rule follower, to he's a stick-in-the-mud, to he doesn't like to imbibe in substances, to he's uber-religious, to he's in recovery, to he doesn't like jam bands, to he only smoked or took a brownie in the 80s, to he knows the answer exactly and just wants it on record, to he prefers the liquid stuff, to he prefers to bang hits of heroin on Mass & Cass.

When one pushes an agenda with respect for the unknowing it comes off as more considerate and the message you push comes across sincere.

The current Waltham administration has long had a policy of cutting to the bone any service it views as nonessential (to its being re-elected). We'd probably have a volunteer fire department by now if they didn't have a union. The services and enforcement you would like to see might not exist anymore. This is what we get when we sign up for 20 years of the same regime. Volunteer city cleanups feel good but are cosmetic. Real cleanup starts at the ballot box.,t2_7qw0a70t,invasive_species_16b,0,1647012940.0,0,t1_i091e9b,i091e9b,False,trewissick,t3_tbd41f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tbd41f/citywide_cleanup_day_april_23/,City-wide cleanup day April 23,/r/Waltham/comments/tbd41f/citywide_cleanup_day_april_23/i091e9b/,8,r/Waltham,0,8
"Sure I'm with you, but let's not pretend there's no downsides.  

First, not everyone likes to be recorded all the time.  

 Second, I don't know city hall technology terribly well, but I'm guessing there would need to be massive investments to make the meeting rooms tech friendly. Then you're also hiring a few IT staff to make sure everything is up and running for each meeting, moderating the Zoom, etc. Big cities like Waltham can afford that, but smaller towns in western MA? So making it a state requirement may be overly broad.   

Third, I'm pretty sure most if not all of these meetings are shown on public access television. So your point about awareness/access may be somewhat overstated. Of course post-facto watching is not the same as Zoom participation. But does a Zoom participant speaking their piece have a meaningfully louder voice than someone who calls/emails/writes letters to their representative and/or the mayor? Maybe - I don't know. But I do feel like people complain about there not being access in the way that they want the access to be (ie, Zoom calls between 6-8pm, which works for their schedule), and equate that to be no access, which I don't think is true. I think it's plenty easy to make your voice heard about Moody St without going to this meeting via Zoom.",t2_pvj95,tedious1,0,1647012538.0,0,t1_i090etz,i090etz,False,craZyJ617,t3_tb7ruy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/tb7ruy/meeting_on_pedestrian_walkway_and_outdoor_dining/,Meeting on pedestrian walkway and outdoor dining on Moody St for 2022,/r/Waltham/comments/tb7ruy/meeting_on_pedestrian_walkway_and_outdoor_dining/i090etz/,5,r/Waltham,0,5

Wait for a good deal from either (around xmas or major holidays usually, you want a good price and ideally some sort of gift card and a year of some streaming service), cancel your current provider and enjoy the much nicer intro rate for a year.

The second they try to increase your rate, cancel and go with the other one.

"This is going to have a huge impact on the area: I use these roads all the time and would also like to know.  

I’ve always thought this is a desperately needed set of improvements, although this time around, I see  changes that will impact me negatively:

- closing the 128N on-ramp from rt 20 west.  On the one hand poor visibility and almost non-existent merge lane makes it dangerous,  up on the other hand lots of people ise it.  I guess we’re supposed to use the new 128N on-ramp from rt 117, but I’d like to see corresponding local road improvements to support that much extra traffic.  Also, where does that stream of rt 20 traffic coming from Weston go to get on rt 128N?

- more traffic lights?  All around the rt 20 rotary?

"I have had mostly good experiences with my two. 

Waltham is well known for being good with kids with learning disabilities and also ""twice exceptional"" kids (for example, a kid gifted in one area and having a challenge in another). The schools my kids are at provide free breakfast and lunch, which takes so much stress off the family. Our kids have needed different extra supports at various times, and, so far, those have been provided immediately with no questions asked and no stigma. (No one ever plans for anything less than the easy kid and the perfect life circumstances. But it's so nice for the supports to just be there without having to fight for them.)

Waltham schools are ethnically and economically diverse and have a far lower rate of academic burnout and suicide than the high-pressure wealthier towns surrounding. I like those features of the schools.

"Seriously folks ride a bike.  Their our a few times a year that the trail in not clear. But not only is it cheaper it's faster. Inside of 2wks I was beating the train on average and the 70 is a night mare. BTW I weight in at 250lb. The bike path then up vaster st is a good route. And most of those Kendell jobs have showers for the most part.  Typically it took me 45mins, if you go this route here our my tips.

1. you don't need a fancy bike but something with gears is a good start
2. get paneers for a change of shirt an underware
3. every day for first 2mo just try to petal a 1% harder than you did day before
4. in the cold get cold weather gear cant afforded it duck tape the vents on your shoes etc.
5. believe this is worth it and set out 30mins early till your a pro.
6. You can do this rain or shine because your tough, you love your self and future generations don't need all this pollution

"I did this for several years -- there are multiple options:

1. Car -- find your way to Memorial Drive and go from there. From the south side, this is like 25 minutes and the worst part is getting out out of Waltham and onto Soldier's Field Rd. You'll need to have parking of course, but this is the fastest in my experience.
2. Commuter Rail from Waltham Center to Porter Square, Red Line to Kendall/MIT. If the train timing works out for you and the Red Line isn't on fire/broken/whatever this is about 35 minutes. Cons are that the commuter rail is relatively expensive and the schedule isn't always convenient.
3. Express Bus from Waltham (lots of stops on Main and Moody) to Boston then: a) Red Line to Kendall/MIT; b) walk to Kendall/MIT. This is slightly longer than #2 as you have to deal with Pike traffic on the bus. Walking from South Station to Cambridge takes about 30 minutes at a leisurely pace and is a nice way to get some exercise. The Red Line from South Station is an option for days when the weather isn't good or you need to get there a little faster.
4. \#70 Bus from Waltham to Central Square then: a) Red Line to Kendall/MIT; b) walk to Kendall MIT.  This is the least desirable option in my experience as the #70 bus is always really crowded and therefore really slow. However, if you find yourself coming home at night after the Express Buses stop this might be your only option.

The good thing about the commute from public transit is that there are multiple options for getting back and forth. Don't discount the Express Buses, sometimes they are more reliable than the commuter rail and the monthly passes are much cheaper.",t2_dr0d156l,One_Operation7983,0,1644445454.0,0,t1_hwabmyz,hwabmyz,True,chefkef,t3_sofv25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/,Best way to commute from Waltham to Kendall Square?,/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/hwabmyz/,1,r/Waltham,0,1
"Probably best you know now to not rely on the Boston public transit system 🤣 I would say, if it’s a train, I would often chose that over the car. Mostly because I loved the time to read or just have a second to myself, also because the road rage is real, and I hate dealing with it (from myself LOL, or others). Busses are almost never on the correct schedule, so be prepared for the time buff you’ll need for that as well. But in general … give yourself a 20 minutes buffer, meaning be at the station early, because on the days when the busses/ commuter rail trains aren’t late … they’re early 🙃 also the pass is pretty expensive, so see if work has either a discount or pays for it. Otherwise you’re looking at another 300-500 a month for the T pass. (Bonus is using it for not work things! Like going into the city for games, etc because fortunately most of our stuff is accessible via the T!) also probably never plan on using the transit system in the winter … just … naahhh",t2_7kp9mtm7,alittlelessnoisehere,0,1644443776.0,0,t1_hwa7a5r,hwa7a5r,True,chefkef,t3_sofv25,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/,Best way to commute from Waltham to Kendall Square?,/r/Waltham/comments/sofv25/best_way_to_commute_from_waltham_to_kendall_square/hwa7a5r/,1,r/Waltham,0,1
"Before the pandemic I took the commuter rail to porter and the red line from porter to Kendall.  In the mornings, my commute was around 45 minutes from door to door.  My house is a 10 minute walk to the commuter rail station and work was directly above the Kendall station.  In the evening the trip was less streamlined given the redline isn't very reliable; however, I would take the express from porter to Waltham which saved substantial time.

That said, maybe once a month the redline or commuter line would fail and my commute would extend to 1 hr+.  In those cases, I would switch to the 70 from Central to Waltham.

"I used to commute this and your best option is to bike - when possible. Public transit is going to take about an hour. You would take the 70 into Central square and then take the red line. The train part will take about 5-10 minutes because it’s only one stop over.

Traffic is the big factor. When I would commute early in the morning around 7 AM it was a bit faster but not sure if you can control that.

The other factors that you should weigh in is parking. It’s really expensive to park in Kenmore but you can find some one hour spots and play that game a bit. Sometimes employers will reimburse you to get a MBTA pass so definitely look into that if you can.

"I meant ""just"" in the sense of ""the only"" -- that is, death is the only outcome of eating a poisoned rodent, rather than something like mercury or lead, which \*I think\* (but am not sure about!) is something that can build up in tissues over time, but which at small amounts isn't immediately lethal?  And like, rather than things like pesticides (which, again, build up and can cause things like weakened egg shells, impacting breeding success).   

Maybe a better way to have said it is, ""I thought that a raptor eating a poisoned rat automatically resulted in the death of the raptor, without any other possible outcomes"".

I totally agree with you, it's something that needs to be fixed.  But there's definitely a lot of things to tackle in order to fix it.  Sounds like something some  of us should be contacting the city about to see what can be done from that angle.  But I also think it would probably require a widespread educational campaign, because the city probably is not the only entity putting out poisons that are dangerous to raptors.  You have to reach the private citizens who might be doing it too.  (Although, I don't even know what regulations there are that people have to follow when it comes to putting out rodenticides or things like that.)

I'm more informed about efforts to address the problem of lead weights used in fishing in NH, because ingesting lead is quickly (although not immediately) lethal to loons.  And I know that effort is multi-pronged, partly involving attempts at legislation at the state level, and partly involving reaching individual fishermen with buy-back / exchange programs to substitute weights made of non-toxic materials.  I also know that there have been similar efforts with shotgun pellets, trying to replace those with non-lead shot. (That might also be aimed at raptors, because of raptors eating birds that have lead shot in them?)

Trying to address the use of pesticides and rodenticides has a separate set of challenges.  Because with things like lead used in hunting and fishing, part of the effort is introducing alternative, non-toxic materials that will still perform like the old lead shot.  With ""pest""-control, the challenge is answering the question of what alternatives people can use to control pest populations that won't be lethal to wildlife.  i.e. ""don't use rat poison"", but offering suggestions for addressing rat infestations, that kind of thing.

(Probably also a good idea to check to see whether organizations like Mass Audubon have efforts underway.)",t2_29yeuei5,eregyrn,0,1644014712.0,0,t1_hvmiah8,hvmiah8,False,austinmclark,t3_sj8lcs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/sj8lcs/recent_captures_of_the_mt_feake_eagle/,Recent captures of the Mt Feake Eagle,/r/Waltham/comments/sj8lcs/recent_captures_of_the_mt_feake_eagle/hvmiah8/,5,r/Waltham,0,5

"I jogged through Mt. Feake during the spring/summer/fall (never really jogged before), but I always felt a bit bad about jogging by when someone was clearly grieving. Is it rude for me to jog in the cemetery? Should I try my best to avoid anyone who is grieving or is not that rude? I usually tried my best to keep breathing/key jingling to a minimum when passing by, and always tried to give space (always trying to be on the opposite side of the road).

I ask because I don't have any family members in cemeteries and as a 3 year old I ""played"" in the Mt. Auburn cemetery but didn't realize how... err bad taste that probably was after going back there as an adult (lots of signs saying no jogging or playing there).",t2_5p6wp,itsgreater9000,0,1643991495.0,0,t1_hvkshpx,hvkshpx,False,grumblegolden,t3_siop1g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/siop1g/any_good_running_routes_around_waltham_that_are/,Any good running routes around Waltham that are clear of snow?,/r/Waltham/comments/siop1g/any_good_running_routes_around_waltham_that_are/hvkshpx/,3,r/Waltham,0,3
"I really  like Sparkle Bright, on Moody Street.  They're near the corner of Moody and Chestnut.  There is a good-sized parking lot in the back (and an entrance to the laundromat from it).  And it's a large place.  (Unless the others have expanded, I think it's bigger than Bubbles or Crescent Street -- both of which I used in the past, and they're fine, don't get me wrong!)  So even when there are a number of people in there doing laundry, it's not hard to get a machine, or find a place to sit and wait.  (And it's easy to go wait in your car if you want, since it's right there.)  It's always been clean and well-lit when I've used it.

By the way, there is also a Bubbles on the southern end of Moody Street, on the corner of Wadsworth.  grizzlyadams33 is talking about the one up on Main St. / Rt. 17, near the shopping center with the Five Guys etc.  The Bubbles on Moody also does have parking in the back.

"At this point, most of the major roads with sidewalks are in good shape, especially in and around the schools and colleges.

When it's heavy snow I stick to Brandeis Loop Rd. (1.1 Mile) Mt. Feake Cemetery (\~2.0 miles all the way around), Border Rd, and Comm Ave as they're well plowed very quickly.   
Hypothetically Main St. and Moody St. are supposed to shoveled out, but that's rare. Shockingly, the Prospect St. Bridge was clear so you can connect up and loop the Watch Factory and the Cemetery as well. 

Yesterday with a couple of days of melting, I was able to do a substantial loop around the city with minimal snowbank dodging.

"My family has gone to eastern clothing in Watertown for years, however - and this is going to sound crazy - but I had a really solid experience at the mens warehouse… here’s my story, and why I’m happy to do business with them..


So, I used to live in Los Angeles, while I was living there, I met my now wife, and while we lived in LA, we got married in Lincoln, MA.  I ended up going to mens warehouse for my suit - and at the time, they had some deal - buy one suit for a thousand bucks, get an additional for free.  My thought was - well I can get a wedding suit, then a more formal one for wakes/funerals etc.  bought my two suits, but only had my wedding one altered.  Long and the short - 6 years later, we’re living in MA, and I was asked to officiate a wedding ceremony for a friend.  I thought “Perfect, I’ve got a suit that would be great for this - just need to get it altered.”  Well, I tried it on before bringing it in, and there was no way this thing was going to fit.  So I went to the Mens Warehouse in Newton(I think it was newton) and I explained the situation, I played it cool and said “I got this a little while ago… and I needed to see if I could get it altered, or even exchange it - it’s never been worn” he finds the receipt and goes “a little while ago? You brought this over 5 years ago on the other side of the country!” We had a little chuckle, and he goes - “given the time that’s passed, I can’t refund you the amount, but I can give you store credit.” Not a problem - I needed a suit anyways, to my shock he gave me $850 in store credit, which was what the suit retailed for.  I even mentioned I got it as part of a deal - and he said “I’m not worried about that.”  They had a deal at the time for a “Custom suit - with free alterations for life” it was $1000, I bought it right away, I’ve since had it altered - with no issues - and it looks great to this day.  

I’m sure there’s nicer Mom and Pop places, but I really can’t say enough good things about the experience.",t2_124qvi,cameronsounds,0,1643060498.0,0,t1_hu2oj7h,hu2oj7h,True,[deleted],t3_s9imwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Waltham/comments/s9imwi/looking_for_a_suit/,Looking for a suit,/r/Waltham/comments/s9imwi/looking_for_a_suit/hu2oj7h/,1,r/Waltham,0,1

The S&S in Inman Square Cambridge used to have great wings - but I have not visited in \~ 5 years.

People say that Buff's Pub in Newton Corner has great wings - your mileage may vary.

I lived in Waltham for 3 years and do not recall ANY good wings (by Buffalo standards).

Started a website about this a couple of years ago and then abandoned it due to lack of time.
