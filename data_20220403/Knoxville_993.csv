"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

There are a lot of great suggestions here, but seriously, A Dopo is one of the top pizza restaurants in the country. Great ingredients, authentic Italian wood oven, great sourdough crust. It’s really tough for me to recommend anything else over it.

"I've heard bad things about a lot of the ""Jiffy Lube"" type places.  Usually it's incorrect fill, old oil filter, over-tightening and stripping the old plug, or not replacing the oil plug.

What type of vehicle is it?  Depending on the make and model, it may be super simple to change the oil yourself.  A lot of German vehicles even put the oil filter in a cartridge on top of the engine.  At the same time, some are a huge pain.

You'll be able to get better quality oil and filters for a cheaper price, and know that it's done right.

But, I totally understand folks that prefer to have someone service their vehicle.  My parents take their vehicles for oil changes.  I'm just lucky to have the ""easy"" ones in my garage.

"If the agent priced at market rate according to comps it should theoretically appraise at that value. When people bid up the price of the house, no one knows if that extra will then appraise.

I'll try to give better example.  Say you have a $200k house. The agent put on market for $199,900. It should appraise for that. If you as a Buyer offer $210k because you like it and want to try a little higher-it 'might' not appraise there-for kicks, lets say it appraised at the listed price. Your loan wont pay more than value so you would have to go back to Seller and say 'Hey Mister/Ms. Seller, you need to go down to appraisal so I will buy this house, it's not worth $210k and my loan wont cover anything above $200,000'. If there was a $205k offer from someone else with an appraisal gap-they are telling Seller 'I'll pay more than the appraisal by (X, for example $5000) dollars if necessary'. Seller would take that offer over yours because it's a stronger offer. In this market-prices are rising so fast because of intense competition that it's a valid risk that appraisal comes low during a bidding war. ***Should also note that most cash offers waive the appraisal which is another reason they are so attractive.

Appraisal gap money is separate from down payment and closing costs. If you have that and it's not needed, then great. If you dont have it-Mr/Ms Seller might go to someone else and take the sure thing.",t2_68swx,kosobudgirl,0,1648989817.0,0,t1_i37tzey,i37tzey,False,HRNewbie404,t3_ts9wr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/ts9wr4/small_rant_about_the_market_around_here/,Small rant about the market around here,/r/Knoxville/comments/ts9wr4/small_rant_about_the_market_around_here/i37tzey/,2,r/Knoxville,0,2

"No way. Leave it be for historical preservation. Keeps you some what connected to your ancestors or the people that was here before us anyway. Like finding arrowheads, or tools made of stone but this is a few magnitudes greater in significance and bad assery

TLDR;
 Personally I am interested in who was here 100 years ago or longer, how they lived, and what they did. And that there tells part of that story. I would incorporate it into your property and landscaping if its located in an assessable and reasonable location relative to your house, main structures,  habitable area, w/e the property is.

 Or re-purpose  it for a very unique, interesting, creative, and meaningful conversation piece of sorts. I don't know much about that sort of landscaping, but I feel like HG tv would bust a  nut on the spot if they had that had to work with. Just be sure to leave it intact and not alter the original structure where it could be restored back to what it is now. 

Only exception to that would be restoring it with historical accuracy in mind. I believe that would be my choice if I had the resources and time. 

 All of this could be way overboard for what it is or if it isn't that old, maybe they're more common than I'm thinking and not very significant/interesting. I've not researched what you've got however I've only seen a handful of similar ""artifacts"" and none exactly like that. so to me, cool and unique and worthy of a project as such.


That said, first step be doing the research and proper assessment of what you got and the age. I seen soneone said as early as the 1800s or turn of the century.

"Last year I found a huge, beautiful studio apartment downtown. I believe it was called the Candy Factory. It was a craigslist ad stating that this upscale place was $650 a month, everything included. I think their studios normally start at$1,600 a month. When I started asking more questions about the unit because things weren't adding up, it became clear something wasn't right pretty quick! In the craigslist ad it said utilities were included but the person emailing me said the tenant was responsible for all utilities. Anyway, it turned out to be a credit score scam. The apartment was not for rent. Basically, they send you to a credit checking website in which you have to put your credit card information in and then they continue to bill you $29.99 every 30 days. They don't give a crap about anything but getting your info on that stupid website and once they have it, all emails stop.

"I'd definitely rate those three in the following order:

A Dopo first. Their crust is a sour dough mix that is like heaven in the mouth. It's so fluffy and delicious you will be craving it for months.

Second is Tomato Head. The have wonderful vegan/vegetarian options, and their pizza is crispy and tastey. They firmly go by a motto that food comes fresh, not from a can and it shows.

"I already double checked with the complex, and there’s no stated limit on the amount of times a lease can be taken over. The rate is also locked in because we resigned back in October until July 2023. However someone not planning to stay that long could easily do another takeover. Another big factor is that the fees we’re paying for the takeover are significantly larger than what the new tenant is paying.

"I’m surprised the complex agrees to this, as it seems very one-sided: you benefit immensely but the landlord is losing out on an opportunity to raise the rent since they could easily lease it at a higher price if they put it on their website. 

Most of the places I lived did not allow takeovers like this, probably for those reasons. My options were to either break my lease and pay the fees or “illegally” sublet (since subleasing was explicitly forbidden). 

This seems too good to be true, especially in this market. But I hope it is true, since the someone else will benefit from it and finding a place to live sucks.",t2_fhpg080c,Potential-Sky-6105,0,1648957460.0,0,t1_i36ldrs,i36ldrs,False,adklibisz,t3_tuxghx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tuxghx/affordable_1_bedroom_apartment_for_rent/,Affordable 1 bedroom apartment for rent!,/r/Knoxville/comments/tuxghx/affordable_1_bedroom_apartment_for_rent/i36ldrs/,3,r/Knoxville,0,3

"This would be what’s called a lease takeover. Sounds like subleasing, but it actually isn’t like that at all. When we sign the paperwork, it fully becomes the new tenants’ lease. There’s no involvement from the apartment office besides providing the paperwork, hence why the security deposit is already paid. We also acquired this apartment through a lease takeover, so the rent is at the rate from 4 years ago. As far as I know, new tenants at this complex are paying nearly $900/month for this style unit.

Edit: also wanted to add that the pet deposit for 1 pet is also already covered, so the cost of moving in is only a $75 application fee per person. This fee wouldn’t be charged until we’re signing the paperwork, as opposed to the usual where you pay a complex an application fee without even knowing if you’ll get a unit.",t2_bjvn8s8,adklibisz,0,1648955730.0,0,t1_i36i4dl,i36i4dl,False,adklibisz,t3_tuxghx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Knoxville/comments/tuxghx/affordable_1_bedroom_apartment_for_rent/,Affordable 1 bedroom apartment for rent!,/r/Knoxville/comments/tuxghx/affordable_1_bedroom_apartment_for_rent/i36i4dl/,5,r/Knoxville,0,5

"They all have good pizza. 

Adopo is the fancy kind,  sometimes with non traditional toppings. Like field greens.  Adopo is also a bit loud and close seating, not very private, but mostly adult crowd. 
 
Hard Knox is same style of pizza but less fancy, more hearty and filling. Even more casual vibe (order at the counter) & kid friendly crowd.  

Tomato Head has booths and slightly more private seating.  They have a lot of other delicious options besides pizza. Their pizza reminds me more of mellow mushroom style, but fancier and healthier.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

Glad I don’t have to see it. There is a “follow the science” anti-abortion billboard in my neighborhood that makes me livid. The right has gotten so good at pretending their views are backed by data.

"You are correct that it takes who people to get pregnant. Decisions are made by at least one party and that is the cause. The fact is that it isn't always a choice, nor something the woman can handle. I've said it before and I will say it again, I am completely fine with a ban on MOST abortions. I say most because there are always circumstances that require it, and if a woman is knowingly going to have an unhealthy pregnancy early on then that is a decision for her and MAYBE the father. This decision is 100% none of your damn business.

Now as for abortions in general, as I said, I am fine with banning them so long as the people pushing to do so actually prove they care about the child like they claim. There are a few things required to do, not limited to the following. A push for proper sex education and showing young adults how to properly avoid an unwanted pregnancy. Free and unquestioned access to birth control (for men and women) to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Make the cost of a pregnancy (ie medical costs and the cost of being away from work) mostly, if not entirely, nonexistent. Lastly, make the process to adopt children cost minimally more than an actual pregnancy and adjust the investigation into potential parents to ensure they can support a child.

The issue I see is that every idiot pushing back on abortions has nothing to say for these issues. Most of them are actively against teaching kids proper sex ed, which actually proves how fucked up they are in the head. If anyone actually cares about the child then they would be 100% for the matters above and would actively push to fix them prior to trying to ban abortion. These issues are a much smaller change that would make a much larger difference than straight up banning abortion.

Now anyone who disagrees with these issues and still thinks a ban on abortion is more important, them clearly it isn't about the child. At that point, all it is about is controlling other people.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"I've had a rough experience or two on Delta-8 THC, but in reality, it's not necessarily Delta-8 THC, but really more THC in general. I've had just as bad an experience on Delta-9 THC as well. 

THC in general tends to bring up subconscious, underlying mental conditions and anxieties and force the individual to deal with these issues that may have gone overlooked. I very much consider THC to be psychedelic in nature and have similar psychedelic qualities in regards to being unpredictable at times and capable of giving people a *bad trip.* 

However, the only times I've had a bad experience on THC, was when I *accidentally* took too high of a dose. Because it was either black market and too strong without me knowing, or in the case of Delta-8 THC, there was too much without me knowing because there isn't much regulation around Delta-8 THC and the amount present in products. 

So my argument is that getting rid of it is not the root cause solution. What we need is more governmental regulation, oversight and stronger testing and packaging so users know exactly what they're getting and how much they're getting. When you buy a beer or liquor, you have a general idea of the effect you're going to get because the product is regulated and is required by law to show you the percentage of alcohol present in the product. Because we have a lack of oversight in regards to how much Delta-8 THC can go into a product, you have products with massively varying degrees of the compound present which makes it much easier for a person to overdose *(take too much)* and have a panic attack.

This is why I believe we need regulation over prohibition. Regulation ensures you know what you're getting, prohibition does not.

"Sevier County has a lot of tourism industry jobs but a lot of them are part time or don't pay that much. I think Dollywood, which has been mentioned, is improving in benefits and what they offer employees but when my husband worked there, he made only a little above minimum wage and it was part time (one week they had him at only like 10 hours). They also have an off season in which you would get unemployment (I think that is if you are going to be returning the next season but not totally sure on that one). They do also have an employee clinic for your health care. And the lunch for employees is very cheap and very tasty, according to my husband.

If you want the money and lots of hours then one of the manufacturing places, like Denso, which was also mentioned, is the way to go. My nephew worked at one (Aisin in Clinton) and he worked six days a week mandatory with so.much.overtime. 

One other option would be if you can do call center work. Knoxville has plenty of call center jobs and while you won't get rich, most are full time, offer benefits, and many of them are going remote so you won't have to pay to commute. There are a lot of different industries, from tech support, health care, insurance, banking, and so on. Just go to [indeed.com](https://indeed.com) and search! Lots of job openings here!

"We use several. I like Kroger because they have the fuel points, which you can use at their gas station or Shell. They mail me personal coupons based on my shopping habits, as well as they have digital coupons. The specific stores I go to (usually Farragut or Cedar Bluff) are clean, and easy to get in and out. Their prices are cheaper than some of my alternatives.

Food City. They are closest to us. Their prices are higher than Kroger, but they also have digital coupons and fuel points.

Walmart. Also close to us. Good prices. Both Walmart and Food City we usually do our ""fill in"" shops at.

Aldi is where I get a lot of things such as paper towels, TP, and diapers for my kids. They have good prices and a lot of unique items. I enjoy their weekly specials which change every Wednesday. Their brand of items is often as good as or better than name brand stuff and they have a very good return policy (never had to use it, only know it exists). My one irk about Aldi is that they close at 8.

Ingles and Publix have beautiful produce and I love how clean their stores are. But they are more expensive than the other options. Ingles has the fuel points, though. We don't shop there enough to use them, though.

We do go to Trader Joes and Fresh Market (Farragut) on occasion when we want to just find different things, usually cheese and snack foods.

"I am not in your position...yet...but have been very disgusted by this problem and worried about the future.

Back in 2016 I was buying/building a brand new, small home in Sevier County. I got very ill, had to go on leave which nearly eliminated my income, my loan was dropped, and I couldn't proceed with the purchase. The house was only $100,000. The homes in that neighborhood are now average $235,000 and they are smaller than the apartment I live in now! It did turn out to be a blessing that we didn't buy that house because our family is bigger now and I don't think I would have liked how small the house was.

Someday I would like to try to buy again. I really think that we need to start contacting our lawmakers and get something done to stop these vultures (investors, flippers, whatever you call them) from sweeping in and buying ALL the real estate! I don't know how, but there has got to be some new laws to stop this practice. The homes they are buying, they are renting out at costs way above what people are able to reasonably afford.

"Haven't had a problem living here. It's surprisingly affordable for the convenience of the area. Especially given how rent prices are rapidly increasing everywhere. And everyone I have met in the complex has been chill and friendly. The management has been helpful to us whenever something came up. Of course we are just one example. I know someone posted here with complaints about the complex recently, so you may have to come to your own opinion. Hopefully more will share their experiences because I don't want to mislead you with my positive experience if you end up not having one here. 

Never seen cars broken into in my part of the complex, or been threatened. Never had solicitors at my door except maintenance checking in on things. I've heard people yelling on the train tracks nearby and that's been it. 

I would just say maybe don't stay out late alone. There are a lot of homeless people and drug addicts on the streets. Metro areas can be dangerous and this area is no exception. I have Oakland and LA to reference though, and honestly, in comparison it has not been so bad out here.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"I am for this bill. . .and it's not because of my religious views or some uninformed opinion.

I simply have no faith in people to use it properly. 

I have no faith in doctors to prescribe/recommend it only when necessary. 

I have no faith in people staying off the roads when high. 

I am also generally against using any drug- prescription or otherwise -unless it is absolutely necessary, especially psychoactive drugs. . .because they are prescribed too often without the proper tests, monitoring, or instruction for use. 

I have seen first-hand how badly drugs can fuck someone up. . .(long story there, so I'll skip it)

You would be surprised how many people are on the road while taking daily doses of  opioids that explicitly state not to drive or operate heavy machinery for 36-48 hours after taking them. 

You would be surprised at how often doctors prescribe certain medications without any other reasoning than ""my back hurts"". . .and then with very little regard to how they interact with other drugs or substances you may be taking. 

Just a couple weeks ago my father was prescribed two different medications for two different issues. . .the doctor said it was fine to take them together, the pharmacist said the same thing. . .go online to the official documentation for the drug . . .""If you take drug X with drug Y, there is a high chance of life threatening side effects.""

So, now, let's step back. 

People are against this bill because it means they'll no longer be able to buy this psychoactive drug freely without a prescription/recommendation from someone who is not a licensed medical professional. . .

A person whose first concern is not about people in pain not getting something they need or that it safe for them to consume/use/smoke. . .but more worried about how this will affect their business and their bottom line. . . .true story, it's in the first sentence of almost every article I read about this. 

> Fears among members of the hemp industry are growing, as a bill progressed in the state legislature this week that they say threatens a $100 million revenue stream and thousands of jobs.

> But Wednesday lawmakers took on a measure to make one kind of hemp-derived substance that's currently unrestricted, restricted.
> And business owners are worried about their livelihood.

. . . .

Yeah, I am all for a bill that puts more controls on various drugs and substances, even if that is an outright ban.

"Admittedly Kroger isn't the best of that list, but if you pay attention to the coupons and use the Plus Card, you can get some really good deals (today I got a 26 oz box of Lucky Charms for roughly $2.50), and the fuel saver can be useful if you don't shop at Casey's enough to get their fuel discount or have a Sam's Club membership. And I've found if you're a fan of name brand pop, the sales they have tend to be the best (along the lines of 3 or 4 for $12).

Discount Grocery is decent on lots of stuff. It's not perfect, and plenty of the items tend to be roughly the same as everywhere else, but they also occasionally have incredible deals - large packs of butter or ground beef for hella cheap and so on. And if you're a fan of hashbrowns, they consistently have giant bags for $1.

"I have a 3 year old and we love finding new stuff to do. Warning - We love parks. Here are our favorites:

1. Karn's Lions Club Playground - Very large, fenced, some shade, sitting/eating area, cushioned turf, great for most ages. You can let a toddler run around here without having to hover.
2. South Clinton Park - Very similar to Karn's above with a different layout. This one has been slightly less busy. I prefer this one because of the drive and scenery. 
3. Oak Ridge Children's Museum - Looks lame honestly but it was a lot of fun for me and my son. We spent 4 hours there! Lots of history to look at/read for the parents and lots of things to climb on for the kids. Stop by the little playground right next door and Big Ed's Pizza for lunch.
4. The Muse - Lots of fun to be had, you can spend a few hours here. Though the last two times I went it wasn't as clean as it used to be. My son needed a bath after we left.
5. Little Ponderosa Zoo - Very fun, you can easily spend 2+ hours here. Was pretty busy two Sunday's ago but we had no problems enjoying everything.
6. Knoxville Zoo - Kind of pricey and not my personal favorite but there's plenty to do.
7. Lakeshore Park - Great fenced playground, medium sized. Lots of scenery and walking areas. Can be VERY busy.
8. Victor Ashe Park - I LOVE this park but we've had multiple run ins with unleashed dogs. If that doesn't bother you this park has a decent playground, great walking trails, and a nice little pond. If you walk, bring a stroller. Kids can get tired quickly.
9. Smart Toys and Books - Good place for some unique toys. An indoor playground for a small fee. Can get very busy.
10. Carl Cowan Park - Small playground which isn't the best for a 2 year old but it does have some beautiful scenery and a lovely swinging bench overlooking the water. Nice for a walk.
11. If you have time, venture over to Gatlinburg and spend a few hours at the indoor water park for the Westgate resort. Even if you aren't staying you can get a day pass for $24. Under 3 are free. Great way to spend a few hours.
12. Also in Gatlinburg - Ripley's Aquarium.

"Saving money?  UGO, baby.  Be ready for weird and off-brands but the selection isn't too bad and in my experience the quality is comparable.  The fresh veg selection is generally poor, keep your eyes peeled for major fruit bargains during fresh fruit seasons (make buttloads of jelly and jam to take best advantage of the windfalls) and the meat section is generally a solid bargain.

Aside from that, Ingles.  HQ'd in North Carolina so it's a regional business and more of the money you spend stays, if not in the area then at least in the same time zone.

I won't do Aldi, or Trader Joe's.  They're only selling their own brands and nothing else, not having that.  That's buying into monopolization.

I'll go to Kroger specifically for one thing: butter.  Kroger uses butter as loss leader bait.  They'll price that stuff through the floor from time to time and reel in shoppers with it; you can find butter at Kroger under $3/lb when other stores are still over $4/lb.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

"Late to this party-but here is my two cents for OP and anyone still scrolling.  Several people mentioned condo-and that truly is the best bet in your situation currently.  Nicest place you are getting for that money and it will still be tough (there are only (8) condo options under $200k in Anderson/Knox/Blount right now as I type this).  Sadly, $200k doesn't buy a move-in ready home in this market.  Please remember that Condo Association Dues vary wildly and count as debt in your Debt to Income ratio-might affect what you are preapproved for.  But more importantly-look over your bills.  Can you save $100/month?  More?  Having an appraisal gap is the best way to combat cash offers and possibly win something you like.  Sellers do not want to take your offer of $20k above asking on a $190k house because it might not appraise.  Then they are out the amount a cash offer was at (and usually close to your financing one)-they dont want to worry about negotiating the price (down).  They want to know you have $5k, 10k, etc IN CASE it appraises low.  If it isn't needed, yay, you can put the money towards the loan, splurge on something for the house, or take yourself on a Celebratory Vacation after the stressful buying journey you just finished.  I never want to advise someone to pay more than something is worth, don't get me wrong-but that money is directly helping your mortgage go down and building equity in your property-and cost of renting, and renting increases-don't.

"I grew up in East Tennessee and spent much of my adult life in Knoxville. Then, I moved to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska for a few years. I also lived in Atlanta in the 90s. 

It was culture shock relocating back. Besides small pockets of liberal people the whole state is pretty red. It’s also part of the Bible Belt and I can’t go anywhere without seeing the Christian influence. Waitresses call me “honey” and “sugar.” 

Culturally Knoxville tries hard but it just doesn’t have the vibe of many metro areas. That’s a generalization, but there’s not any neighborhoods here you can compare to places like little 5 points or midtown in the Atlanta I once knew.

Traffic sucks. No it’s not like other places but it is getting worse all the time. You once could expect some rush hour delays, but be able to get around pretty freely during the day. Not so much anymore. I avoid it like the plague.

Housing is ridiculous now. Apartments are expensive and on long wait lists. 10 years ago you could find a really nice home for $250,000 or much less. One look at Zillow and you know that’s not the case.

I moved back for family. I like the scenery pretty good, particularly the Great Smoky Mountains and the Cherokee national forest . There’s a ton of waterfalls to hike too; rivers to kayak, lakes to play and fish on, and cool roads to drive. Downtown has a decent farmers market.

If you can find your people and make a community of like minded folks it can be a decent place to live.

There was never a strong case to prosecute them for the fires outside the park. Even the civil suits went after the NPS and not the kids.

"Your post has been filtered because you are using a new account or have low karma. Once your account age and karma increase, you will no longer see this message.

Have Questions?  Below are answers to the some of the most common questions regarding this automod message:

1.  Why are you filtering post and comments? - This is a basic measure to keep trolling and spam comments to a minimum on the /r/Knoxville subreddit. Most bots and other accounts used for these activities are generally new or have very low karma.
2.  I am not a bot though, I promise! - That's exactly what a bot would say! Kidding. These comments are put into a queue that the mods review on a regular basis. Comments/posts that are not trolling attempts and do not break /r/Knoxville rules are approved and available for the subreddit to see.
3.  Well how do I get karma if I am filtered? - Karma can be earned anywhere on Reddit, not just /r/Knoxville. As you use your account more, your karma should increase and you will no longer see this message. Also, as said in #2 above, we also check the queue routinely for valid comments/posts that should be marked visible.
4.  Censorship! - Automod has no idea what your comment or post said, it simply looks at your account age and karma level. When both of those improve, you will no longer see this message.

I had bought one of those .99c bags because we carried our stuff home. He accused us of stealing this cheap bag and was sticking his head in our bags and just looking through everything like it was his. So rude. He jut had a problem with us because we had no car and would wait out on the patio sometimes. They even told us we weren't allowed to come back once because I spent about 45 minutes waiting for my SO to get there after work.
