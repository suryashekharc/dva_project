"I've lived in the area for a few years now. Haven't personally had any problems. Neighbours are all very nice. One neighbour recently moved back here from the north side of brockville because they missed it. We regularly walk downtown to the stores, restaurants, and bars, and love the convenience.

Many of the century homes have seen better days, but every year i see more of them with major renovations. Personally I think the area is a major opportunity for the forward-looking. Given the price you pay being so close to the downtown and waterfront it's a steal. With the cost of housing in other urban centers I'd bet the whole brockville south of the tracks will see a boom of young and old families as the area realizes what its sitting on. 

Every nice place I've ever lived (downtown Kingston, Westboro in Ottawa) is filled with stories from locals who say ""this place used to be so sketchy, you wouldn't believe it"". I'd argue that those nice places are just as sketchy than this area (in terms of the population of questionable people).

"There isn't much interest in religion-associated activities in Brockville. Most regular church-goers are in their 60's and over. There are activities and organizations but unfortunately hardly anyone younger than 40 is in them. I can give you some contacts if you are still interested in that, though. I currently volunteer at Loaves & Fishes which an organization that prepares meals for homeless and low-income people. We are based in the LLGAMH building between Front Avenue and Park Street. Again, though, most of us are older than 40.

Pandemic lockdowns have really put a dampener on the sort of thing you are looking for. Clubs can't really gather as much as they used to yet and a lot of the places they used to meet in have gone out of business or shut down. Volunteer opportunities are a bit scarce, too, right now. Best thing to do might be to check at the YMCA or the Brockville Library for advertisements. Or peruse the Brockville tourism.com or Downtown Brockville.com sites for daily events. There is a rowing club that is active in the summer. There is also a diving club. There is a ship watching club, too.

Yes.  [It is going to get a LOT worse.](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/federal-modelling-very-intense-omicron-surge-1.6315123?fbclid=IwAR0pPFc6J7pw7ItEDjMqksvwFlvt7st2JDBz6gnzy-mur2F6iSkVZilIBt4)  The R(t) on this variant is so high that it is going to get everyone, vaccinated and unvaccinated alike.  What will be different is that the unvaccinated will get sicker than the vaccinated, will be hospitalized more than the vaccinated, and will die more than the vaccinated.

The vaccine greatly reduces your chances of becoming very sick, of being hospitalized, of ending up in the ICU tying up beds that could be being used to treat cancer patients, heart attack patients, and others, and of dying from the virus.

The German Health Minister said a few weeks ago that by the end of March everyone in Germany will be vaccinated, recovered, or dead.  Typical German bluntness.

> with the vaccinated and the unvaccinated

Also true.  More vaccinated people are getting sick from Omicron because it has such a high R(t) than with other variants but they are getting very sick, ending up in hospital, ending up in the ICU, and dying at a much lower rate than the vaccinated.  The anti-reality crowd point to the fact that the vaccinated are ending up in hospital but ignore the fact that in most places the vaccinated are 80% or more of the population (98% in LG&L) so the unvaccinated are many times as likely to end up sick, hospitalized, in the ICU, or dead than the vaccinated.

> cause the unvaccinated can’t work which is plain bullshit

The unvaccinated CAN work if they get vaccinated.  Food service workers are required to be vaccinated against Hep A and Hep B.  Want to work in food service?  Get vaccinated.  Want to work during a global Caronavirus pandemic? 
 Get vaccinated.  You have the choice whether you get vaccinated or not but that choice comes with consequences.

> why should someone be forced 

No one, not a single person, is being forced to get the vaccine.  You will NEVER be held down and vaccinated against your will.  You have the choice.  What you want is to be able to make that choice without consequences and that's not how things work.  You can choose to drive a car without a license but that choice has consequences.  You can choose to yell, ""Fire"" in a crowded theater but that choice has consequences.  You can choose not to get the Covid vaccine but that choice has consequences.

> to take an experimental drug

The mRNA vaccines are NOT experimental.  The technology has been under development [for decades (with much of the research happening in Canada or by Canadian doctors and scientists abroad)](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/52424.html) and was first used to develop the SARS vaccine during the SARS pandemic scare.  Neither was this vaccine rushed.  The technology was well known and solid.  No steps of the approval process were skipped.  The multiple steps of the approval process were run at the same time but each process was followed in accordance with the Health Canada vaccine approval process and completed and documented as required.  Had any of those steps been failed the vaccines would not have been approved.  It's also worth noting that the vaccines have been approved by every country independently so each has been through more than 100 approval processes.

> that even after you take it you can still get it plus all the other shit blood clots cancer and heart attacks

Blood clots were an EXTREMELY rare adverse event.  There were a handful of cases documented with one vaccine in very specific circumstances.  Researchers identified the mechanism of that adverse event and changes have been made to mitigate that risk by narrowing down who can get that specific vaccine.  [You have a MUCH higher chance of getting blood clots from the Covid virus than you do from the vaccine.](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/covid-19-presents-greater-blood-clot-risk-than-vaccines-study-finds-1.5565518)

Cancer?  No one has gotten cancer from the vaccine and no one is going to get cancer from the vaccine.  [That's just a ridiculous suggestions.](https://www.mskcc.org/coronavirus/myths-about-covid-19-vaccines)

Heart attack?  No one has had a heart attack as a result of getting any of the vaccines.  There have been cases of myocarditis which is an inflammation of the heart but almost all cases the person made a quick and full recovery.  [You have a much higher chance of getting myocarditis from the Covid virus than you do from any of the vaccines.](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25133462-800-myocarditis-is-more-common-after-covid-19-infection-than-vaccination/)

You're an ignorant, selfish, entitled asshole.  We get that.  You do you.  This pandemic is yours now.  My entire family and all my friends and 98% of the people in this area are vaccinated and/or boosted.  We're safe.  You're not.  Enjoy your pandemic.

The person that this story was about most likely has substance abuse and mental health issues.

Well I've been playing phone tag with them on and off. Every one of them is very nice on the phone, but they lie to me constantly. They promise to call back in 15 minutes then i wont hear back for 3 days.

I was told they sent the tech to do the test. waited a whole week, then called them and found out that no tech was ever sent. 

after almost 1 month of F#$%ing around with them i finally get the confirmation that i can get internet from them. Turns out there is about $600 of hidden fees in addition to the fees listed on their website. 

literally the only reason i am still giving them my time is that i hate bell more than i have been jaded by their terrible service.

"I was just discussing this last night with the spouse, you hit the nail on the head. 

> it’ll be harder for a community like Brockville where very little new development is happening.

We don't live there (I grew up in Brockville and still visit often and my family is all still there, so I keep up with the news) but I don't see the new area builds happening in Brockville like you do in towns with more active development. It only just dawned on me last night; I don't really see examples of mixed residential in Brockville that other suburban areas have worked in to their area structure plans.   
Like here for instance, it would be nothing to see a new townhouse complex being build along side the larger *new* single family homes in all areas. I can't think of many spots in Brockville that have that. Maybe Bridlewood (what's the newest area of town)? 

If a developer wants to build in a specific spot they have to provide buildings for all residential options, not just swaths of land dedicated to double car garage single family homes.

there’s also some courts in looks like in Lansdowne but it’s a bit of a drive and i haven’t been out to see what the surface is like or if the nets are up.


there’s two courts behind the YMCA but the nets aren’t up yet and i’m assuming you have to be a member to play. 


there’s also a court up in the industrial area i think it’s showfer park or something by black and decker which has been recently resurfaced it looked like but no nets and it’s been transformed to a pickle ball court. *rolls eyes*

if you spot anymore let me know! there was also another court north of maitland but it was in rough shape and looked like the net had been up all winter. i think if you want to play tennis in this town the best course of action might be too get a membership at either the golf course (there looks like some beauty courts south of King street/HWY 2 but they look private for the residents of that community or golf and country club members) or a membership at the racquetball club in the old mall. 


AND we should call parks and rec to get on resurfacing the asphalt courts and to keep them for tennis!! then we can keep playing for free!! i’m new to town too so if other people called in it would be a big help!! i love living here but a bit of upkeep on the tennis courts and a few more public rinks would go a long way i think!! this town has so much  potential!",t2_mwsd7si,Bengalman90,0,1618672182.0,0,t1_guuyq39,guuyq39,False,Bengalman90,t3_mox94o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brockville/comments/mox94o/tennis_nets/,Tennis nets,/r/Brockville/comments/mox94o/tennis_nets/guuyq39/,0,r/Brockville,0,0

"I'm moving to Brockville soon from Ottawa. My father lived there for 10 or so years before he passed away recently...I visited Brockvegas all the time and would walk downtown at night all the time and never saw a glimpse of what has been wrote here. I see that is #19 on MacLEANS  list but look at the stat's in that evaluation. Anyways, I'm not here to defend or argue that it isn't dangerous, I'm just shocked at how people are portraying the place. I think it's going through a change with many people being pushed out of the Ottawa market for cheaper real estate, and a smaller town feel without being too far away from a big city. I am personally looking forward to being a resident early this summer and hope to see some of you at the 1000 Islands Brewery (my new favorite place)",t2_771s0csc,No_Responsibility626,0,1616760136.0,0,t1_gsa5t7t,gsa5t7t,True,Gerdius,t3_lvn3yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brockville/comments/lvn3yr/moving_to_brockvlle/,Moving to Brockvlle,/r/Brockville/comments/lvn3yr/moving_to_brockvlle/gsa5t7t/,3,r/Brockville,0,3

"There used to be one in the 1000 Islands mall, however when it was sold to new owners, all the indoor locations got an expiry notice on their lease. If they wanted a location in the strip mall they needed to take a new lease but that wasn't worth it for Coles as they didn't have the sales volume needed to make it worth their while. Same thing happened with Bluenotes unfortunately.

Like HatMuseum said though, definitely check out the Book Trader. I did some christmas shopping in there and the amount they have on sale is incredible.

"Just east of the city limits on Hwy 2 (King Street) there is a little plaza with the Homestead Cafe and St Lawrence Heating. This is across the road from the Super 8 motel. There is a hydro line that runs North, starting at the east edge of the plaza parking lot. You can let you dog of the leash and walk North up the hydro line until you reach the railroad tracks. You can cross the tracks and the trail continues, or bend left at the tracks. This takes you to the back edge of the old Psych Hospital. Before you get to the Psych, the main trail has a tunnel under the railroad tracks. This leads to several trails in the woods between the tracks and the 401. We meet the same 5 or 6 people with their dogs. There are a few XC skiers and a guy tapping the maples for sap. There is also a pond that someone shovelled off in January for a skating rink.

"Moved here in in the fall of 2020 from Ottawa. The winter seemed a lot better than Ottawa's! I understand that people have some concerns around safety, and apparently statistically it's not the safest when compared on the Maclean's dangerous places index. That being said, luckily we have not yet ran into any dangerous situations or people. I haven't personally experienced the 11-3pm safety window Kkurb talked about. We frequent the downtown at all times of day  and night (8am-2am), walking, without issue.

I would recommend checking out the 1000 Islands Brewery for a fun place to go for great beer and food. Other places we like: Don's or Manoll's fish and chips, Nakhon Thai, Island Delight. We like 1000's too much to have tried too many other places. There is a beautiful walk/bike path along the water heading West toward Gananoque, and a few nice parks or towns to visit. The Mac Johnson Wildlife Area is nice too.

We've had extremely welcoming neighbors, and haven't experienced any us vs. you yet. If I shovel, clean, put up decorations, etc. everyone comes out to chat. We live closer to the downtown. I've never met as friendly of people in a barbershop as when I got my hair cut in Brockville. Literally everyone seems to know each other, and they all pick up from the last conversation they had. Good luck in your house hunting. I've heard a lot of sales coming from people moving or investing from Ottawa.

"Hi there,  well I can’t speak to others experiences,  from my experience I love being in the “downtown core” of Brockville in our old Victorian home.  

I grew up in Toronto central , spending 20 years there, and then moved to ottawa central for 8 years. Does brockville have its niche characteristics and local colour? Absolutely. So does every other place I have lived. What it also has is some of the kindest neighbours who smile and like to chat, good contractors that have been in and out of my house now for the better half of a year, a very scenic river front environment with great parks, and a nice central
Location if you want to scoot off to Ottawa/Toronto/Montreal. 

Is Brockville perfect? No. In fact since I have moved here I have definitely been craving more of a downtown community. This may be partially due to the pandemic but I also feel that there is a changing of the guard so to speak. I’ve noticed and introduced myself to several young couples and families in my neighbourhood, all of whom have moved into the area with the past 6-18 months. I don’t have kids yet so I can’t comment on any experiences regarding schools or day care etc

Anyways, it’s good that you are doing your research. The Brockville market is definitely one that I would recommend but the beautiful thing about Canada is you are free to live where you choose.

I guess I'm really ignorant as to how horrible Brockville really is? I grew up in the valley and have spent lots of time in Almonte, CP, Perth, Arnprior and I would never, in my wildest dreams, imagine a similar-sized nearby town being actually dangerous to live in.

I live in a slightly larger town in Alberta right now and there is very much an us vs them culture, but it only plays in gripes in conversation. No one is actually treated differently because they weren't here when it was a small town and I wouldn't be scared to walk anywhere at any time.

"We've lived here since Aug 2020 and to be fair, it was during the pandemic's summer remission with reduced restrictions. I am keeping the pandemic in mind while writing this.

The pandemic, however, does not explain the experiences we've had with the shady contractors (getting ripped off for $5000 during our first couple of months in was not a good start), complete lack of professional services for our child with severe developmental delays, ridiculously high taxes (for a city this size with no public recreation centre, pool, previously mentioned lack of developmental services, etc.) The people here (in our neighbourhood at least) are more unfriendly than friendly. And the shopping is bordering on abysmal. The big-box stores are usually very poorly stocked and you can expect to not be able to find what you are looking for frequently. I would try to support local vendors, but there is such a lack of variety here that I find it necessary to shop online for tools, kids' things, gifts, etc. There are no specialty grocery stores here and if you consider yourself a ""foodie"" you would find it challenging to get good ingredients without going to Ottawa or Kingston. 

And finally, that one little incident about my son getting attacked  by some crack-head's dog three weeks ago kind of sank my impression of Brockville to a new low. Especially since my attempt to report it to the animal control officer was futile. I mean, it's bad enough that when someone calls what you would think would be a crisis phone number (twice) to report an attack only to be greeted with an answering machine; but you would think that somebody should at least reply back to the messages left. Still to this day... no response.

So I hope I haven't ruined anyone's impression of Brockville, but since someone asked, I feel obliged to report it as I see it so far.",t2_65vowa85,Bzzz_bzzz_bzzz2021,0,1614728363.0,0,t1_gph38jh,gph38jh,True,Gerdius,t3_lvn3yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brockville/comments/lvn3yr/moving_to_brockvlle/,Moving to Brockvlle,/r/Brockville/comments/lvn3yr/moving_to_brockvlle/gph38jh/,3,r/Brockville,0,3

"While still legal-y this sums it up:

“Tall Ships involved a project to develop property acquired by the appellant developer on the Brockville waterfront. The property was to be transformed into a mixed condominium tower and maritime discovery centre (“MDC”). 

In a number of agreements with the City of Brockville (the “City”), the developer agreed to remediate the property and assume a number of roles in the construction of the MDC. The City then promised that the developer would qualify for tax credits based on the costs of remediation. The City further agreed that the developer would receive compensation for its work as a construction manager.

After the MDC was constructed, the developer would sell the structure to the City. The City would also pay the equivalent of the construction budget for the MDC, as well as fit-ups and exclusions.

In the end, the MDC turned out to be a more expensive project than anticipated. 

Once the developer sold the MDC to the City, it submitted various claims for payment.  These included claims for remediation, compensation for additional construction costs, and interest.”

[Link](https://www.torkinmanes.com/our-resources/publications-presentations/publication/are-commercial-arbitration-awards-immune-from-judicial-scrutiny) 

Basically tall ships agreed to build the city a facility, but went over budget. When the city didn’t pay all the costs Tall Ships was asking for Tall Ships went to arbitration. The arbitrator ruled against the Tall Ships claims, but when Tall Ships appealed it was found there were errors in the arbitrator’s decision.  

The former and I think current Mayors have written Facebook posts about the dispute that are really the only plain language explanations I’ve seen, I’ll see if I can find any. 

As far as I know it doesn’t affect condo owners at all. The issue is over  the MDC (Aquatarium) not the condos.",t2_dfbgd,HatMuseum,0,1612816396.0,0,t1_gmmcjf7,gmmcjf7,True,Rescue_Smew,t3_lfhztz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brockville/comments/lfhztz/whats_the_legal_issue_between_tall_ships/,What's the Legal Issue between Tall Ships Development and the City of Brockville?,/r/Brockville/comments/lfhztz/whats_the_legal_issue_between_tall_ships/gmmcjf7/,8,r/Brockville,0,8

"Those links are great!

I think crimson is correct, if you are parking on their land. However, if you are using the easement (which i'm assuming would have to be specifically for a vehicle, an easement for a person walking probably wouldn't be appropriate for a car) to park on your own land it seems like that is the point of an easement. I suppose it is unclear whether you are parking on your own land, or considering you can park on an easement on their land.

I'm not a lawyer, but a little googling says that easements are registered for and against land, not people. ([https://www.protectyourboundaries.ca/blog/how-easements-affect-private-property-rights](https://www.protectyourboundaries.ca/blog/how-easements-affect-private-property-rights)) So if you are merely driving on an easement to arrive at and park on your land, then that is the whole point and it doesn't matter whether the person who owns the land doesn't give their permission. As well, the land owner would not be allowed to obstruct the use of the easement. However, if you are planning on parking on the easement on another person's land, or blocking the right of way of another person to use the easement, then no, you can't do that.

It also sounds like you want the deed or title which specifies this easement and the right-of way. Lacking that, looks like you would want a survey conducted.

Probably reach out to an actual lawyer, maybe the one you used for the home purchase. Perhaps this is the sort of thing covered by title insurance? It sounds like it could be, and wouldn't hurt to ask. On the other hand, if crimson is a real estate lawyer I differ all my judgement to them.

"I would recommend trying Don's and Manoll's fish and chips. Each are really good. Local staples, so I've heard. I prefer Manoll's, but apparently Don's uses Manoll's original recipe. Ask the owners for the history/drama there if you're interested.

I'd recommend taking a drive West to have a look at the thousand islands and the cottages or neighborhoods built on them. Kind of a neat little world. There is a really nice path spanning from Brockville to Gananoque for biking/walking/running, with parking spots that makes a nice day of exercise. Also Mac Johnson wildlife area is a nice stroll. I think the Brock trail reaches from Mac Johnson down to Blockhouse Island.

One spot we really like to go is the 1000 Islands Brewery. It's a great atmosphere, great food, and great beer! Try out some of their seasonals like the peach one or the ""root beer"". They serve the root beer beer on ice with a straw, and it would actually have you believe they got your order wrong because it tastes exactly like a root beer. Other places we've liked: Buell street bistro, Nahkon Thai, Island delight (try the egg rolls). We don't really know anyone here though, so I'm sure there is a lot left to discover.

We were here in the fall and when it's warm blockhouse island and the rest of the downtown is a great spot to hang out and get a bite to eat, and it looks like the beach at St. Lawrence Park would be fun too.

Brockville is a pretty neat place full of history. Down town on king Street there are signs everywhere that have a picture from back in the early 1900's and a description as to what you are looking at. Also there are metal plates that are on some houses of famous Brockville residents and a description of what they did for the community. The fountain at courthouse is awesome to look at with the bust of sir Isaac brock. If you go down to block house where the little Marina is you'll Canada's first rail way tunnel which is pretty cool. Lots of stuff to do. Honestly when it comes to places to stay away from there isn't much. Most people here in Brockville are quite accepting and there aren't many issues with new comers.

"If you're willing to spend the gas a 4 wheel drive really makes all the difference in the winter. 4 wheel drive with a nice tread on the tire and it's easy going. 

We just made the same move. Working in Ottawa for the gov but bought in Brockville 2 months ago. 

The agency we purchased the home from said most of their clients the past 4 months have been Ottawa and Toronto folks who have gone remote. They're seeing a massive demand for homes in the area. 

I know people in Toronto who commute 2 hours one way to get to work. So a 1 hour drive isn't too bad when you consider how much cheaper the houses are in Brockville compared to Ottawa.",t2_75wl7is4,DankDog69420,0,1597974078.0,0,t1_g2a5659,g2a5659,True,xyww,t3_iaxdhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brockville/comments/iaxdhr/anyone_who_commutes_to_ottawa_or_used_to/,Anyone who commutes to Ottawa?

Pros/Cons

All depends on if you are into Doug Ford or not?
Let’s just say I was shocked to see so many guys I went to high school with become right wing politicians. 

Have you seen the hockey team logo yet? They have NO plans to change that after years of complaints.

Opioid addiction is rampant. It’s heartbreaking.
Please watch what neighbourhood you move into. You may loose most of your belongings, or you might find some of your stuff for sale on the Brockville Swap and shop.

"Hi, I grew up there, moved away 14 years ago for work. Like many people you don't know what you had growing up until it's gone!
My mom and brother still live there and when I go home I always drive around Blockhouse Island and enjoy the downtown architecture. 
Lots of good restaurants, at least before Covid. Shopping is small townish, but kingston/ottawa not that far off.
Housing is reasonable. A plus is being on the 401,  so travel is easy, and going over the border (someday) is also easy.
In my younger days the nightlife was solid, more pub/bar than clubs though.
I miss eastern Ontario and will likely move back someday from western Ontario.
Just realize that it's kind of sleepy, you have to make your own fun.
Oh yeah, it's great if you are a boater.

"The flooding has been mostly limited to right beside the river, like Blockhouse island. Has been more common the last couple years, but they just close it to traffic or close part of the footpath once in awhile.  
The streets are so steep though by the time you get to King Street (the main street) you're up 12 meters higher, the first 3-4 floors of tall ship landing would be underwater before it gets there.   
   
If you're looking at the river the only grocery store near the river is the Metro on King Street, but it is close to the Brock Trail & Rotary Park as well.

"We will be ok everyone!  Use logic and common sense and we will be get through this just fine.  No need to panic.
The precautions being taken will surely sway the spread of the virus and aid in its decline.  Our country and leaders have done a phenomenal job of taking the proper steps to stop the potential mass spread of this virus and they will continue to do so.

Don’t forget, the virus has already run it’s course where it first originated and China in general is seeing a decline in numbers of the virus day to day so we have already seen a potential timeline for the virus.
Stay Safe, be logical and stay in touch with your family and loved ones by phone or online while we wait this out.
