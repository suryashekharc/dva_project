**Route 30 Roadway Improvements**

Covering two separate projects along Route 30, PennDOT is aiming to complete construction along the well traveled roadway by October of this year. Totaling over $8.60 million, the improvement projects along the state road will include: resurfacing, realignments, new left hand turning lanes, milling, overlays, new guide rails, drainage improvements and slope stabilization work.

During construction, traffic will experience significant detours for a 200 day period. Along the alternative routes, motorists will be taken through parts of Ohio and West Virginia before returning to destinations in Pennsylvania.At this time, PennDOT anticipates starting the project on April 4.

**Bennetts Run Road and Park Road slide repairs**

A series of slides have also created a need for a $1.81 million project repairing roadways in North Sewickley and Brighton townships, causing detours throughout different parts of the year.

The first series of slide repairs began on Monday in North Sewickley along Bennetts Run Road. Crews temporarily closed the roadway to all traffic as they began the construction of a new rock slope between the River Road and Seventh Street intersections, with current plans anticipating that the closure will continue until May.

Slide remediation will also take place in three spots along Park Road in Brighton, with closures planned between Dutch Ridge and Bradys Run roads. Two of the slides will be repaired with new rock slopes and the third will be repaired with reinforced slope soil and gabion baskets.According to PennDOT, construction on the slides will begin in the middle of June and will continue until August. At this time, a detour route for motorists has not been released.

**Freedom Road upgrades to continue throughout the year**

Residents in Economy will also be affected by roadwork along Freedom Road as PennDOT continues a lengthy $21.75 million project between Park Quarry Road and Route 989. Throughout the project, crews will work to realign and widen the roadway, construct new shoulders, add guardrail updates and install drainage improvements. Plans also call to shift utility locations, add additional turning lanes and install a roundabout.

Due to the scope of the project, various roadway restrictions will take place throughout the project. Motorists will see detours, single-lane restrictions, lane narrowing and alternating traffic at different stages of construction.The full project is expected for completion during the fall of 2024.

**Brodhead Road construction projects**

A new project scheduled to start later this year will see various improvements along Brodhead Road, with crews working on the roadway from Route 18 in Center Township all the way to the Allegheny County border in Moon Township. According to PennDOT, improvements will cost upwards of $11 million and will include: milling, resurfacing, shoulder work, culvert preservation, signal work, guide rail updates, drainage improvements, signing and pavement marking installation and other miscellaneous construction activities.Throughout construction, flaggers will control the flow of traffic along the busy roadway. PennDOT detailed that the restrictions will typically occur during daytime off-peak and overnight hours.This project is expected to begin in late May and continue until the summer of 2023.

**County road base repairs, resurfacing and sealing planned throughout the year**

Base repairs, washout repairs and guide rail updates are also planned to take place later this year in New Sewickley Township. The first project will take place along Lovi Road (Route 2006) between the intersections with Freedom Road.  Crews will also conduct work on Big Knob Road, with the project causing lane restrictions between Route 68 and Route 989.

Flaggers will control the flow of traffic throughout both of the township's repair projects. Construction on both roadways is expected to be completed in fall of 2023.Resurfacing contracts will also have crews complete milling, resurfacing, and drainage improvements along the following roadways during 2022:

* **Darlington Road/Briarcliff Road (Route 588) from Route 51 to Samuel Street in Chippewa Township**
* **Briarcliff Road/Steffin Hill Road/Twenty-fourth Street (Route 588) from Valley Street in Chippewa Township to Eleventh Avenue in White Township**
* **Braden School Road (Route 4025) from Route 51 to Route 588 in Chippewa Township**

PennDOT also announced plans to resume its 2021 Beaver County Seal Coat project this summer. Sealing will occur along state roads in Brighton Township, Chippewa Township, Big Beaver, South Beaver Township and Patterson Township throughout the season. Short-term single lane closures will occur periodically during this time.",t2_4alr4,ddesigns,0,1647457451.0,0,t1_i0x4ste,i0x4ste,True,ddesigns,t3_tfppxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/tfppxb/road_projects_across_beaver_county_to_cause/,"Road projects across Beaver County to cause restrictions, detours throughout 2022",/r/BeaverCounty/comments/tfppxb/road_projects_across_beaver_county_to_cause/i0x4ste/,5,r/BeaverCounty,0,5

"I'm a Hopewell resident with 2 school aged children.  (Speaking of, I don't see Hopewell as a flair option in this sub, if you could add it as a mod).  Previously lived in Aliquippa and sent my oldest to private school until we could move to the better district.

It's my understanding that Hopewell has missed out on certain state funding because they refuse to merge with Aliquippa in the past.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't have concerns about it, but in practice there are actually a ton of 'Quip kids who already go to Hopewell, using grandma's address kind of thing.  There was a scandal where one of the football players was tattled on, and a bunch of other players refused to play last year in protest.  I guess my point is there's already a lot of friendships and community between the two townships than you'd expect.

I have a lot of faith in Hopewell's administration.  I think it could be done if properly planned and provide savings to both districts.

"There was a wave of this statewide in the early to mid-1960s that was the doing of the PA Dept of Ed.  This is how we ended up with the situation we have now in many parts of the state i.e.  geographically huge rural school districts that service a comparatively low number of students.  Transportation costs are enormous and transit time for the kids is quite lengthy.  I don't really see how that is better than small local school districts, even if those districts have all grades housed in one moderately sized building.  With remote learning options, the complaint that such-and-such a subject isn't offered in such tiny districts kind of loses its zing.  Nobody should be in too much of a hurry to give up your local district.  There is a valid complaint that there are too many layers of administration with which I completely agree.  Rather than lose your school districts, maybe the local people should be examining sharing upper levels of administration.  One superintendent can put his happy ass in his car and drive between several districts over the course of a week much more cheaply and easily than transporting thousands of kids many miles each day,",t2_9cezj,scumpup,0,1645040538.0,0,t1_hx7o611,hx7o611,False,ddesigns,t3_stv3qy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/stv3qy/declining_enrollment_at_schools_in_beaver_county/,"Declining enrollment at schools in Beaver County could lead to mergers, consolidations",/r/BeaverCounty/comments/stv3qy/declining_enrollment_at_schools_in_beaver_county/hx7o611/,2,r/BeaverCounty,0,2

"Lots of good comments here. Just wanted to chime in and vouch for Center Twp., right across the river from Beaver. We moved here from Moon Twp.

We’re an early 30s couple and to us, it’s smaller, quieter, (mostly) cheaper here, and a nice alternative to those bigger and busier areas like Cranberry. The kindness of our neighbors is night and day from our old neighborhood. You’re very close to grocery and shops (except the mall, that’s just a waste of space now) and when it comes to the cracker plant, you’re certainly close, but it’s out of view for most of the suburban areas in the township and not as “in the wind path” as places like Beaver is said to be. You’re close enough to drive to Cranberry or Robinson for a bigger selection of restaurants and shops if you choose, and you’re right across the water from the Main Street in Beaver for really nice local options.

"Hello, I’ll keep it brief for what I know:
Beaver County is a tame place. Pretty nice overall. Small town vibe but can be a bit diverse here and there.
Locations: 
New Castle: tbh don’t know much about it
Cranberry: Seen as the wealthy neighborhood in the county with lots of shops and different restaurants throughout. Has a lot going on. Real nice place but could be expensive to live (no idea if this is true tho)
Beaver itself: Wealthy but to a slightly lesser extent. Everything you would need is close by, ex. Grocery store or schools if you’re a parent. Most shopping/restaurants are confined to the Main Street. Calm place in general and puts you basically in the middle of everything so if you want to explore outwards it isn’t too difficult getting to point A or B. (It’s surrounded by many highways that can take you straight to Pittsburgh or cranberry for example.)
It’s important to note that in Beaver there is a large cracker plant being developed on the other side of the river.",t2_17giv3,ya_boi_whistleboy,0,1643174162.0,0,t1_hu9ah35,hu9ah35,True,[deleted],t3_scxivh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/scxivh/possible_relocation/,Possible Relocation,/r/BeaverCounty/comments/scxivh/possible_relocation/hu9ah35/,4,r/BeaverCounty,0,4

"I've been in Ambridge for 15 years. Place used to be a dump back then. Hookers and crack heads all over the main street. Place is 1000X better now. New stores and places to eat. It's not Sewickley but it's changed for the better. 

The corrupt police chief is gone so all of those issues that came with that are resolved.

The school district might not be the best if you have children. Taxes are also highest in the county.

It's as safe as any other town around here. In 15 years I've never had any issues.

ODBQ for great BBQ. Bridgetown Taphouse has great food and beer. Best fried pickles around. New brewery has a few good beers and random food trucks.

"It’s a nice little town. More breweries have been opening up lately,Bridgetown Taphouse is only maybe 5 years old. Good owners, good food and atmosphere. I went in there the first day they opened, one of the owners was very excited and proud.

 There’s Altered Genius that’s new. Police Station Pizza (just called Pizza House) is delicious pizza and very unique. It’s all takeout, order by the slice or whole pizza, only a handful of options for toppings. You walk in and a guy points to you, you tell him what you want, and then stand and wait until they point you out again. Cool place. 

There used to be an old restaurant called Rook’s that was filled with old Pirates stuff, and pirates players old and new liked to stop in there a good bit. Burned down about 8 years ago, absolute shame. 

They used to have an annual wing fest that’s fun, but they’ve skipped it in some years recently. A Greek church also does an annual event, I forget what it’s called but they have great gyros. 

The golfing place up on the hill is worth stopping for a beer. They had an ice cream shop that burned down right around the time of Rook’s, but they recently rebuilt it and I think it’s open again.

All that being said, don’t walk around alone at night. Not too much happens but still not the best place late at night.

"I am sure that you've already read about this in detail, but from a local perspective, Aliquippa and most of the river towns in the area went from farming communities to industrial at the turn of the century.  Aliquippa flourished the most due to the largest mill, bringing immigrants from mainly Italy and Eastern Europe. The area grew for about 80 years, then collapsed in the early 1980s due to mill closures. Thousands of people that had dirty but well paying jobs with little skill set in anything else had no other option but to relocate or take on less well paying jobs. The area became an older community in a matter of a few years as young people went elsewhere while their parents and grandparents took to retirement. The bustling downtown area is now mostly rentals, boarded up buildings and a few tire shops and bars. It's almost a very small version of what has happened in Detroit metro area and other parts of the rust belt. J&L steel is now a sparse industrial park. I think out of the other towns that relied on the steel mills Aliquippa has adapted the least and has looked the same for two or three decades.  I have lived in and experienced more dangerous areas than downtown Aliquippa but it's definitely unsightly. I do hope that the future generations do help bring the town back as they are in the parts of Pittsburgh.",t2_65en32nl,GRCO1510,0,1599057481.0,0,t1_g3q1qvt,g3q1qvt,True,Real_human_i_promise,t3_ifvmbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/,I would like some insight into life in Aliquippa.,/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/g3q1qvt/,3,r/BeaverCounty,0,3

"I've had 2 terrible experiences personally up there. One of the times I went up there with a VERY OBVIOUSLY, visibly broken finger. And they literally told me it was fine. 

Needless to say, I went somewhere else and had to get surgery done less than 2 weeks after visiting the medical center.

The second bad trip, was when I sustained a traumatic brain injury that's side effects lasted longer than 2 years, they told me it was a concussion at first. Well, no shit. But then after going back over a year later, begging for someone to understand that I still felt way off. They basically said I was crazy, and told me I was okay. It offended me because I'm a very sensible person, and they basically said I don't know how I feel inside of my own body. I then went to UPMC, and had to go through physical rehabilitation therapy for months because it was in fact, not ""just a concussion"". My brain could of been bleeding internally, they wouldn't have known because they didn't care. No tests, no MRI, nothing. I could of died.

They see less patients overall,  they see hundreds of strep throats and broken bones but that rare condition you have? They might have never seen before.

"I wasn't born in Aliquippa, but spend the last 10+ years living in and around it.

I'm actually not sure what is left of the old mill, now I'm curious.

As to your other questions :

> but what made others stay

Once the mill shut down there was a mass exodus from the area.  This is actually given as a reason why there are so many Pittsburgh Steeler's bar's across the country - so many people left the area and transplanted elsewhere across the country.  Most of who ""stayed"" were older Italian-American families who lived their their entire lives.  As they die off, the houses get sold for cheap to more low income people, and it the area continues to decline.  For example, the annual ""San Rocco"" festival (they cover it [here](https://storyboard.cmoa.org/2016/05/in-aliquippa-life-persists-in-the-wake-of-big-steels-collapse/)) parade has been moved from Aliquippa to I believe neighboring Center township.  The parade was interesting - basically they set up tables every block and stop to drink, it used to take them hours to go like 1 mile.

> Want do people do for fun

Football is huge in 'Quip because they field a good team every year and one of the few things they can take pride in.  Honestly it's also a fantasy way out, they've had a [number of players go pro](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/schools/high_schools.cgi?id=93b85330).  The football stadium is nicknamed ""The Pit"".  Last year visiting team buses had to get police escorts down to The Pit because fans were breaking out windows, etc.

> It was on a road of recovery

I would say the opposite.  I haven't seen any positive improvement in the area.  As someone else mentioned, the Police are corrupt as hell, the DelTondo murder was just bringing it into the spotlight.  The last San Rocco I went to (after the parade they had a carnival of sorts with rides and gyro's and such) had I think a PA State police helicopter with a spotlight buzzing it because it was that bad.",t2_3nei9frr,LoemyrPod,0,1598549258.0,0,t1_g31jojn,g31jojn,False,Real_human_i_promise,t3_ifvmbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/,I would like some insight into life in Aliquippa.,/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/g31jojn/,2,r/BeaverCounty,0,2

"There’s a 48 Hours episode about an unsolved murder in Aliquippa called “What happened to Rachel?” that covers the rampant corruption and crime in Aliquippa very well if you’re able to find it. Aliquippa has 9 unsolved murders, an insane number considering the population size. The police department is a joke and I’ve heard rumors from many people of the mob having completely infiltrated the police there. It’s a very interesting but sad story.",t2_bnydu,pickleman_22,0,1598356967.0,0,t1_g2si5u9,g2si5u9,False,Real_human_i_promise,t3_ifvmbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/,I would like some insight into life in Aliquippa.,/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/g2si5u9/,4,r/BeaverCounty,0,4
"The quickest route between my childhood home and my grandparents' house went through Aliquippa.  We always made sure the car doors were locked before going through downtown, and eventually my dad forbade my mom from taking that route.  The downtown area is a slum with one or two nice churches and the BF Jones Memorial Library which I spent a lot of time in as a kid.  I remember a mural or sign on a shuttered pet store with a white and yellow cockatiel.  It's not really a ""city"" city, mostly 3 or 4 story brick buildings which are now ruins.

Some of the more outlying areas, especially as you go uphill from the river, are nice.  But that's only in comparison.  Half decent suburbs, strip malls full of discount stores and fast food.  The Dairy Queen (an ice cream parlor) used to have very unique desserts/flavors but was purchased by a franchise and now is sanitized and free of any character or uniqueness.  My dad would stop at Mac's Donuts on weekends or special occasions for a treat.

My uncle used to have access to huge swaths of the old mill land along the river, and we would drive out there in the middle of the industrial desolation on the 4th of July to watch fireworks from other towns along the river.",t2_5e62e,tlorea,0,1598331953.0,0,t1_g2rskku,g2rskku,True,Real_human_i_promise,t3_ifvmbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/,I would like some insight into life in Aliquippa.,/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/g2rskku/,3,r/BeaverCounty,0,3
"The whole downtown section (Franklin Avenue) is still there with many original buildings (including the BF Jones library which still is in use) but most of the stores from Aliquippa’s heyday are shut down or turned into other things. 

A unique aspect about Aliquippa is how different populations settled there. There are many different clubs for different nationalities, as well as different churches that those communities set up (ie the Ukrainians, Croatians, Italians, Greek  etc all had different sections of Aliquippa). It happened because it was easy for those groups to settle with their peers, they could speak their languages together and celebrate their traditions together. Nowadays the areas are pretty blended but many of the clubs still operate, though not a lot of young people frequent them. 

Hopewell township surrounds Aliquippa on three sides— the only side that it doesn’t border is along the Ohio river. I went to Hopewell school district and would often have to drive through sections of Aliquippa to reach them. 

Henry Mancini (who wrote the songs for pink panther, Peter Gunn, moon river from breakfast at Tiffany’s) was raised in Aliquippa and went to school with my grandmother.",t2_xh6ym,a368,0,1598325153.0,0,t1_g2rimjg,g2rimjg,True,Real_human_i_promise,t3_ifvmbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/,I would like some insight into life in Aliquippa.,/r/BeaverCounty/comments/ifvmbk/i_would_like_some_insight_into_life_in_aliquippa/g2rimjg/,5,r/BeaverCounty,0,5
