Road construction and maintenance, parking lots bigger than the buildings they serve, paving over valuable land that could be used for food and housing, rapid consumption of limited energy and resources, harmful emissions, needless crash injuries and deaths, paying banks to loan us our own depreciating assets, paying insurance companies just in case they get damaged, etc. etc.

"If only it were that simple. A lot of our traffic doesn't come from locals going from their early-1900s Sears Kit home in Downtown Ypsilanti (so convenient for the bus!) to their job at U of M or one of the many white-collar jobs supported by its presence. Folks drive in from the Townships, Belleville, Taylor, Van Buren and Redford and hop off the highway at 94 or 275 or 23 to use US-12 or M-17 to get to wherever they have business. This plan doesn't realistically get any of those vehicles off the road, and they're certainly not going to park in a commuter lot after driving all that way just to sit on a bus for another 20-30 minutes.

I can see this plan helping Ann Arbor quite a bit as Ann Arbor rapidly propels itself toward being a place densely populated enough that having a car trends toward being an expensive inconvenience, but with Ypsi's (read: and Pittsfield's) ample strip malls and street parking, peoples' time preference will almost always be in favor of private transportation unless they simply have no other choice. Even if I live right on the 4 or 5 line, (meaning my house is probably worth somewhere between $150k and $500k, significantly increasing my chances at having a car) I'm probably not taking the bus to go to my dentist at Packard and Stone School because it would turn roughly 20 minutes of travel time into over an hour of travel time round trip.

I appreciate the hardcore cyclists and civic duty wonks who are worried about global warming, but I'd like to see a transit plan that helps real Ypsi residents more than funneling more economic activity into Ann Arbor simply because it's the only place someone unfortunate enough to live in Ypsilanti without access to private transportation can get to.",t2_3hux0,sleepynate,0,1647951839.0,0,t1_i1ni7u3,i1ni7u3,False,happydaisy314,t3_tjbefs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ypsi/comments/tjbefs/how_a_big_tax_increase_could_reshape_public/,How a big tax increase could reshape public transit in Ann Arbor And YPSILANTI area,/r/ypsi/comments/tjbefs/how_a_big_tax_increase_could_reshape_public/i1ni7u3/,4,r/ypsi,0,4

"I dunno, honestly. We already throw a ton of money at public transit to less and less ridership every year. It doesn't make sense from an economic standpoint to continue to invest more money to be used really inefficiently for a service that less people are using. What I don't see in the article is discussion of how improved technology (rip off a few ideas from Lyft or Uber) could improve the speed and accuracy of dispatch and routing to help serve more people (like those farther from a bus stop) with better quality (by not having to walk as far). I think that with a little brainstorming there are probably much better ways to serve the people who still want or need the bus system as it currently exists.

Heck, they could even do something immediate to help the underserved, akin to the Night Ride program and just let people take subsidized taxis.

Largely, I think we would all bear the burden of cost along with Ann Arbor and surrounding areas, but most of the benefit would go to the richer areas around us.

"Appleridge? That area is fine. It's just a blue collar working class neighborhood, I grew up nearby and had many friends who grew up there. It was a rougher area back in the 90s but families lived there then too. Ypsi just can't seem to shake the reputation that it earned a generation or two ago.

The trailer park behind the party store is shitty, it truly is. There's another shitty trailer park on Holmes nearby. Poor people gotta live somewhere man. Mind you, just north is a brand new neighborhood as well, so developers sure aren't afraid to build nearby. I'd expect most of the farms going up Ridge before Geddes disappear over the next generation, most of them on the Canton side are gone already.

The park nearby is great. Coleman's market on the corner at Holmes is a family owned fruit and vegetable market you should take advantage of. Los Amigos at Michigan and Ridge is good, Gabriel's is nearby as well for your cheese steak needs. The community center on Clark has a ton of programs, a skate park, a cheap muni golf course.

Easy access to Belleville and Canton for shopping, easy to get to US12 and I94.

I gathered this is the point where the developers are ready to move forward and have figured out what the gap is between construction costs and what they want to sell the homes for--about half the homes would be sold below construction costs, $140k-220k?, and deed restricted to maintain affordability in future sales?--and the ask for public support (through tax increment financing, where the project pays back part of costs through a portion of future property taxes) triggered the CBO process.  Final site plan expected soon, and at some point I heard target timeline of 60-120 days for various approvals?

Most of the part I was tuned in for, though, was the immediate neighbors throwing every argument they could think of on the table to try to stop the development from happening at all.

"I'll point out that I'm a white cis man who has been living in Washtenaw County for ~15 years, at least half of that has been in Ypsi or Ypsi Township.

As someone else stated, Ypsi has definitely come a long way from where it used to be. Since the early 2010s, Ypsi has been gradually improving as far as crime and poverty are concerned.

I lived for ~3 years in the Heritage Park neighborhood adjacent to Perry Early Learning Center. This was before they completely rebuilt the public housing over there and just shortly after the Hamilton Crossing apartment complexes went under new management (or so I was told). This is considered a very bad neighborhood, partly due to drugs, shootings, and abandoned houses. While there were a couple of incidents while I was living there -- namely, a shooting due to a bad drug deal -- I never actually felt unsafe over there, day or night. The majority population of the neighborhood is BIPOC. Worse thing that happened to me personally was someone's scary-looking pitbull got loose and ran up on me and my dog, but turned out the dog was a sweetie, and the owner wasn't far behind.

I was renting at the time, but I had friend buy a house (super cheap) in that neighborhood around the same time. In the approximately decade since, her property value has nearly doubled with her doing little to the house other than superficial repairs and putting minimal effort into upping the ""curb appeal"". My own house, in the College Heights neighborhood, has increased in value by 30% in less than three years.

This is my own personal experience, of course, but it frankly jives with other stories I've heard of ""sketchy"" Ypsi as well as people who have bought or rented long-term. I've also lived off LeForge and Green previously with even less problems (other than hearing a couple gunshots in a year). IMHO, don't listen to the haters. If you can, come visit Depot Town and Downtown Ypsi, drive around some of the neighborhoods, and make up your own mind.

Ypsi's bad reputation is a combination of old rich people (who visited Ypsi a couple times a few decades ago) loving to share their bad opinion of Ypsi as well as the general unease rich white people feel around people of color.

I love Ypsi, because it's a diverse, working-class city that has a real sense of community and is, by most measures, a very queer-friendly place.

"We went with the Ann Arbor Homebuyers Agents. They are only buyers agents, so there is no conflict of interest as they don’t have any properties for sale. Great staff, they go above and beyond. And don’t let the name fool you, they will go anywhere to show you a house, we went as far as Dearborn.

FYI, I know it sounds crazy, but apart from the down payment, you also need money to cover appraisal short fall. These days, any house in semi good condition and at least an ok location is going to sell for over appraisal value. So make sure you have that extra 5-10k in cash. Don’t be discouraged, we lost about 10-12 bids.

The good houses go quick these days. Don’t fool yourselves, if you see a promising listing that’s been up for more than a few week, there’s something majorly wrong with it. You’re not going to stumble upon a hidden treasure these days. 

I don’t know what your budget is, but if you have a low range, you might occasionally see a house pop up in some of the more elite neighborhoods (normal park, collegewood area). This might sting to hear, but it’s a bait listing. These days, some realtors are posting normal park homes for low prices (200-220k) just to create a bidding frenzy. The truth is that the home is really going to sell more for like upper 200s. Or they need a lot of work.

Make sure you either check Zillow frequently (at least once a day, but probably better to do 3-4 times a day) or set up a notification system. Check other websites too. Sometimes listings will come up on other sites before Zillow, and vice versa. My wife would often find properties on realtor.com that I couldn’t see on Zillow. And also pay attention to the list your realtor sends you. They might send listings not on these websites.

One last tip, if you’re looking in Ypsi, you will notice that there is a certain triangle (94, Michigan Ave, and wiard rd) where there is a ton of houses for sale. I hate to be so pessimistic, but there’s a reason there’s so many homes in that area that don’t sell. Make your own opinions and judgements based on visiting that neighborhood and looking up statistics.

I wish you the best of luck. Do your research, and don’t feel bad if you have to take another year to save up more money. Remember that you don’t pay the realtor anything if they don’t land you a home.

" Sorry! I guess it was a silly post, without enough info. I’ll copy paste the beginning of it, if that helps?

Here sits lonely David at his desk, with a book before him, yet not reading. Spiders lived in his rolltop desk; and though David did not like spiders much, he endured them and their webs here, and even occasionally fed them with captured insects, for, having months ago taken this beautiful wooden desk from the side of the road on an impulse, carrying it over pavement and dragging it through grass, straining his side in the process, thinking that it was a sign he should at last return to school and get his college degree—and yet never having returned to school, never having used the desk for anything at all except brief journal entries or short stories which were thinly veiled and almost brazen exercises in self-pity, or blind self-reassurances of magnificent future endeavors which would prove to everyone that he was not, in fact, completely worthless and even an impracticality incarnate, but merely a late bloomer, he endured or one might even say groomed the two spiders that lived in the corners of it, as a kind of symbol by which he ridiculed himself.

It was so quiet this day! David stared at the odd funnels in which the spiders slept, and realized how quiet it was, this day. The child in the apartment above him, he mused, must be still sleeping or away, for his or her heavy feet did not disturb him as they did most of the day, most days; the six or so students living in the apartment beside his own had clearly gathered elsewhere last night, for they were as a rule obnoxiously loud late and early; then, most significantly, the train had not come for some time (or if it had David had still been asleep), and the expectance of a very noisy train at regular periods caused the prolonged silence of the tracks to be pregnant with horrible sound, every minute more gravid, fatter and fatter the silence, until it became a tangible discomfort and anxiety, like a still-distending balloon that should have popped already, like a pregnancy without travail. Come screaming, David thought, screeching on the old tracks as they bend, and I can be easy for a while.

He tapped on the desk rhythmically and blew air that vibrated his lips against each other. He muttered lines from several unrelated poems, and then stated: “I am a useless person; I will run away.” But, on a strange impulse, he chose instead to sit very still, making no sound whatsoever. Then, leaning into a swelling feeling of sadness, rather than attempting to distract himself from it, as he more often tended to do, he shut his eyes and ceased even thinking; and in this perfect, thoughtless quiet, an idea came of nothing and from nowhere and struck David, whereupon he laughed, and roughly yanked his nose, and an exact replica of his being came into the world, clumsily, face-first. The replica was flung at the desk but, being too large to rest upon it, fell backward onto David’s lap and, being too large also to rest there, tumbled finally to the floor, groaning and curling into a ball.

David sat down beside this new, naked David, touching his cheek to comfort him. “This is bad,” he said. “Are you alright?”

“I’m okay, I guess,” Naked David said, cupping his rectum with a hand, feeling there most acutely nude, and making a darkly-thinking face.

“Were you just sitting at the desk, thinking that you should have gone back to school this semester, and thinking how unusually quiet it was?”

“Yes. And then I was naked and being thrown onto the desk, though I would swear it was me pulling on your nose. On my nose. Well—I will need to think about this for a long time. I will go get some clothes.”

But then Naked David, instead, smacked Original David in the side of the head as hard as he could, and only then traipsed to the closet to get dressed. Original David was baffled and enraged, but almost immediately, by force of will, shuddered into cold tranquility, swearing a later revenge, when Naked David was not expecting it. He could, he knew, enter the closet, punch his doppelganger in the genitals, and kick him in the belly, and yank his ear; but that would be simply brutish. Instead, he would wait—and Original David laughed to think of it—he would wait for him to be mid-sentence, or dead asleep, and shut him up or wake him up with a hard bop on the nose.

So he positioned himself coolly on the ground, propped up on one elbow, and pretended to be deep in thought. He noticed how dirty his room really was; from six feet above the ground one does not see the lint, dirt, and grime on the carpet or the baseboard. He felt ashamed of himself for living in such a grimy place. When the other David came out of the closet, Thinking David looked up at him and said, “What do mourning doves sound like?”

And when David began to make the sound that mourning doves make, Lying Down David said to him, “no, I mean, give me a simile.”

And then David, realizing what he was being asked—that is, that he was supposed to give a response that only David himself could give—he said: “Like the sensation of wet dirt. However, I disagree with this simile.”

And Inquirer David said, “Curious. We are exactly, exactly the same. Until now, I have never had a thought that you did not also have. But now I think we are diverging rapidly—it even makes me feel anxious—tell me, what am I thinking?”

And Inquired Of David sat down on the floor, and said, “You are thinking, that this is either an irrefutable proof in favor of God, or against Him.”

“No. And what would cause us not to have the same thoughts at the same time, all the time? I think twenty-three years of existing as the selfsame entity ought to trump, more or less, three minutes of separation. What am I thinking now?”

“Now you are thinking, that we will be very good friends; and we can share our 40 hour week, making only a 20 hour workweek for each of us. We will eat double, of course, but I don’t mind sharing a bed—”

“Wrong again. Then either we are free creatures, which seems unreasonable, or mere seconds of a divergent perspective are enough to fractalize the thoroughly predetermined will and thought processes.” (He mashed a fist into his palm as he emphasized the word ‘fractalize,’ proud of his use of the word, and joyful for the opportunity to use it). David did not believe in free will, not because he really didn’t believe in it, but simply because it’s an exhausting belief to have. “Seconds—that is the effect of mere seconds!—then it is true, men are infinitely far apart. By evening we shall be strangers.”

“Of course, we already knew as much; only now there’s me here to prove it. But I speak as though I were your double, and not you mine!”

“You are my double.”

“Rather say ‘we are our double.’ But, maybe I’ll kill you. One of us, it seems to me, is expendable now. Or maybe I’ll move into the woods! You know, that is just the thing: let us both have jobs, and we’ll save up to buy me a plot of land up north.”

“Oh, I’m not going to stay down here. I’ll go north, or we both go north.”

“By virtue of your selfishness, then, we are enjoined forever.”

“And now, having at last an audience, I shall tell a story. Indeed, you have already some idea of the general plot; but improvisations may change a great deal.” David stood up, cleared his throat, and gave the other a strong kick in the side of the head. “Idiot. Do not strike me again,” he said. Kicked David rolled around, holding his head and groaning, plotting a great revenge. Once Kicked David seemed to have recovered, or at least ceased agonizing, David began to tell a story, which I shall recount now.",t2_gcv4eta0,the_bucket_rider,0,1646513022.0,0,t1_hzhsjhc,hzhsjhc,False,the_bucket_rider,t3_t7exzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ypsi/comments/t7exzs/the_literary_works_of_a_deceased_friend_an/,"The literary works of a deceased friend, an Ypsilanti native",/r/ypsi/comments/t7exzs/the_literary_works_of_a_deceased_friend_an/hzhsjhc/,3,r/ypsi,0,3

"You should look at their estimated margins, I remember someone either here or on FB back when they closed did some diligence on it and it was really tight. Their operating costs were pretty high given the property, wares, and venue (separate from property). The location's visibility really is lacking. I would suggest you drive around ypsi and look at other places driven by foot traffic (cross st/ugly mug, some of the coneys, etc), and then end at cultivate. Better yet, walk it. Get to cultivate as though you're arriving for the first time, and it's just a brick building with a wooden fence and an awning in back. Without expressly knowing it's a coffee shop, there's a lot of consumer effort in engaging with the location.  This being opposed to something like STUFD or the on-campus starbucks, both locations that extremely clearly identify what is being offered in a way that still allows the consumer to experience nuance. Finally, it's unsurprising that a business based primarily on the aesthetic-focused peak-hipster synergy of craft beer and coffee in a single location failed when faced with real business hardship as the result of covid and the obvious decline in what was already a trickle (in proportion to what I imagine their expectations were re: profitability and keeping the doors open).",t2_i6vih,901191,0,1646429879.0,0,t1_hzdc3xb,hzdc3xb,False,damnarbor,t3_t620hj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ypsi/comments/t620hj/anyone_want_to_buy_materials_unlimited/,Anyone want to buy Materials Unlimited?,/r/ypsi/comments/t620hj/anyone_want_to_buy_materials_unlimited/hzdc3xb/,-3,r/ypsi,0,-3

"Which part of my comment do you think disagreed with your stance on renters and landlords exactly? I don't believe we have different stances on the issue, but if you're talking about landlords protecting the value of their property, or advertising it? The legal duty to take action to prevent that - in both cases that you mentioned - is on you. That legal duty is established in the lease you signed. The leases are trash, and I agree that you've been given the short end of the stick in some very particular and universal experiences to renters in ypsi, regardless of the lessor.   


This is how business is done in ypsi. I left for a reason, this one mainly. The town is dying rapidly and is likely in its death throes, especially because of the socioeconomic encroachment from ann arbor.   


The problems you described aren't going to be able to be solved by one person interacting with their landlord. In order to affect change to reach what I believe to be your desired end state - that being renter protections favored higher than those for landlords on a whole - you will have to get involved with the formation of local property laws and municipal/effective interpretation of the Landlord Tenant Act.   


In order to do that - you  will likely have to get involved with local politics, which requires you to be a resident of the municipality. I have family in ypsi, and I had lived in the area long enough to feel comfortable with getting involved. I believe the majority of the council runs uncontested, and I have material certainty that they are as a majority receiving kickbacks from the local landlord association (they change names frequently).   


I wish you  luck if you want to do anything besides whinge and moan, but as of now you're just singing the same song as every other person in ypsi who rents.

"Seconded to what the other commenter said, B&B is the best in a really shitty situation.   


If you're not used to renting in ypsi, I can understand why the more landlord-favored laws might be surprising to you. You can thank McKinley and their inhouse attorneys at Fink & Fink for slowly-over-time shifting rental agreements in order to disenfranchise tenants in the name of ""landlord rights."" Unfortunately, this means a lot of your grievances - while well-founded and reasonable - are not legally actionable.   


Barnes and barnes has maybe three on-call maintenance personnel at any given time. I only met one, and while brusque he was professional and always gave me a \*\*verbal notice\*\* before entering. If maintenance is there to enter your apartment and they have not provided notice, they have to be there for a maintenance emergency. If you're in an apartment building, a leak in someone else's unit can qualify this (for example, there are more causes). Because the threshold for what qualifies as a ""maintenance emergency"" is so low, they can ostensibly enter your apartment without notice at any time as long as they have due purpose and cause to be there.   


Also, you \*did\* give permission for them to enter when they wish. You have waived your right to advance notice by giving them that permission. Please no one do this in the future if you do not like unannounced maintenance visits. The reason they provide this option is so that they can allow their maintenance personnel more flexible schedules. That's it.   


If the house/unit is excessively drafty, you have a duty per B&B's leases to inform them of the energy loss. Excessive temperature changes (as well as exposure to the outside atmosphere) in a domicile can lead to mold, personal injury, and irreparable damage to the property.   


The parking situation with B&B requires legal action on the part of  tenants, especially because of the amount of damages B&B could hypothetically be on the hook for. If someone wanted to form a class action in regards to the dirt lot they have near Cross and Perrin, that would be the easiest way to suss out whether or not there is legal action that you can take.   


They have the right to advertise your apartment whenever they want you say that you want to stay there. The unit is their real property. Read the entirety of your lease verbatim. Really, really read it. Landlords exist to screw you over, and the law enables them to do that.   


Also, looking at ypsi as a place for cheap rent really exacerbates the gentrification issue. If you just plan on leaving in four years, why not seek out on campus housing? Not to mention the fact that EMU is at the state maximum for state-run school tuition iirc. Ypsi is a really confounding place unless you're stuck there for family or a truly boutique work situation.",t2_i6vih,901191,1,1646422007.0,0,t1_hzcri3m,hzcri3m,True,[deleted],t3_t6p93l,https://www.reddit.com/r/ypsi/comments/t6p93l/renting_near_campus_lets_talk_barnesbarnes/,Renting near campus… Let’s talk Barnes&Barnes,/r/ypsi/comments/t6p93l/renting_near_campus_lets_talk_barnesbarnes/hzcri3m/,2,r/ypsi,0,2

"Year-Over-Year. Basically - how much money I can make off of the property in a given 52-week period compared to previous 52-week periods.   


Because the property is commercial/retail/non-res whatever - and is being sold with the business not just as a property - this portion of due diligence is pretty important. Even if you do turn a profit, you're not going to make your money back in a year, most likely for several. The YoY returns are important to know if the business is growing, stagnant, or dying. It's a very consistent measure of yield-over-time, especially when you measure it against other environmental factors (neighboring businesses, the local/municipal tax rules and how those might affect gains, etc etc etc ad nausea).

"I'd look to get plants that are native to our area and permanent - not so much the ones you've got to plant every year.

Rhubarb is impossible to kill. When I want to move it I literally dig it up with a shovel, break the roots apart, and dump them in a new hole. I never water it, and it always grows. Rhubarb has a great flavor and can be cooked a billion different ways. Comes back every year by itself without fail.

Raspberry plants are great for easy fruit, but you gotta give it a year or two before they start really producing, so maybe not if you're leaving in a few years. Same with apple or pawpaw trees.

There's a wild ginger that's cold tolerant. It's a root plant, so just like rhubarb you plant it and let it do its thing. Dig some up when you want some ginger for stir fry or ginger beer.

Alpine strawberries or cherry tomatoes are good examples of things you can baby individual plants...or you can just let it go nuts and harvest out of a big pile of plants that replant themselves each year. 

If you've got a couple fruit trees, a pile of rhubarb, some strawberries, raspberries, and tomatoes that just grow in your yard, it's pretty great. Carrots, onions, and celery are also pretty hard to kill and really nice to have around.

So I got into subreddits like r/frugal to save more money for immigration costs. Also I regularly visit Canada. 

I will totally look up getting a bus pass, and I know there’s going to be a library near me. 

I don’t smoke but I do consume weed. My roommates already told me of some good stuff but the one I’ve been going to a lot is Exclusive in Ann Arbor because they got sales on edibles all the time which I usually like (I don’t like to smoke weed) and a rewards program.

"I'm assuming that you're staying somewhere that doesn't eat up your monthly, so I won't address that. Invest in a bus pass. A bike's great but inclement weather is a factor. Besides, there are reduce fare cards for those who qualify ([https://www.theride.org/fares-passes/discounts](https://www.theride.org/fares-passes/discounts)). For everyday goods, zeroing in on stores that provide you what you need at a reasonable cost is key. The challenge is transporting your goods, so the bus'll help.

Get good, durable clothes and shoes. It's a cost but it's important. If you go to thrift stores (Goodwill on Carpenter Rd, Value World on E. Michigan near Ford Blvd) there's a good chance of getting something of good quality. If you want to save big, clothes are a great way to do it by avoiding brands and impractical items.

Reasonable food is out there. The several dollar stores have consumables, as does Ollie's on Ellsworth. For fresh food, Save A Lot on Washtenaw is decent, the the Ypsilanti Food Co-op is can be inexpensive, and there is Growing Hope/Ypslanti Farmers Markets, an excellent organization ([https://growinghope.net/](https://growinghope.net/)) that is addressing food needs. Don't stock up on perishables! Buy what you need for the upcoming days. Throwing out rotten food is a waste, especially when you buy a bunch to keep cost down.

STOP SMOKING. Not necessarily for health reasons (although the resulting health problems is expnsive medical-wise) but the cost of a pack/box is ridiculous. Smoking is a money black hole. Here are numbers: [https://www.verywellmind.com/how-much-money-does-smoking-cost-you-4143324](https://www.verywellmind.com/how-much-money-does-smoking-cost-you-4143324). 

Cheap drinks (not sure about the cannabis scene--I got a guy) and restaurants are out there to be had. Happy hours are plentiful as are restaurant specials. Food trucks too, especially near the end of their serving hours. Talking to these guys is a good idea. They have the lowdown on reasonable and could become a decent hookup. Latinx food (Mexican, Central American) is great in Ypsi. The little shops are reasonable (La Torre Taqueria, Miny's Mexican, et al) and having a burrito with everything can pretty much take care of your stomach for the day. Don't forget the various Coney's. 

Medical. Ive worked with The Packard Health Clinic ([https://packardhealth.org/](https://packardhealth.org/)) and met with the good folks at Corner Health [https://www.cornerhealth.org/](https://www.cornerhealth.org/)). Hope Clinic is available too ([https://thehopeclinic.org/](https://thehopeclinic.org/)).

Entertainment nowadays is wifi. For free, there's Wireless Ypsi ([https://www.facebook.com/WirelessYpsi/](https://www.facebook.com/WirelessYpsi/)), been on that many, many times. It's reliable but not for gaming or downloading, and is spotty when streaming. At the various restaurants and coffee shop, it can be had for a price of a drink.

"I watched it happen when I lived at Spice Tree apartments. When we moved in 2015, rent was $650ish a month plus utilities. At the time the student population there was already established, but by the time we moved out, it was evident that it was almost all students. How did we know? The massive drifts of Ikea furniture and hand-me-down couches that gathered by the dumpsters every winter and summer when the semester ended, and then the subsequent dearth of cars. So what does Spice Tree do? They decide to bilk the parents of these students. They ""renovated"" the apartments (read: new refrigerator, carpeting, and paint job) and suddenly were charging $1200/mo. for a single bedroom unit. And you know what? The students didn't go away. In fact, they just kept coming. The place barely has residents in the summer now.

No one in that area could afford a doubling in rent when it occurred. But the Spice Tree owners saw dollar signs on the face of every student, and we all got to pay the price.

Regarding the shops in question, the very ethnicity of their owners causes property owners to charge them more...and then a few years later, everyone else around them gets the same treatment. This is the unfortunate reality surrounding this situation.

I do not have any problem with either of the named businesses existing. The problem is their locations.

Unfortunately, it is directly a racial issue, mainly caused by racist landlords and other property owners. The only way to fix it is to either a) introduce rent controls or b) intimidate individuals who attempt to establish entrepreneurial interests in the area that do not align in spirit with the values of the city populace.

The A2 Aristocracy will never permit Ypsilanti to enact rent controls because that would mean massive revenue loss for Ann Arbor proper, where people really do pay $2500/mo. to live above a fucking theater, and where the student slums would suddenly be very empty.

Another solution that would function instantly but cost property owners massive amounts of money would be to establish only certain neighborhoods as student housing.

There is PD Productions ([https://www.ptdproductions.com/current-season](https://www.ptdproductions.com/current-season)) (a Jeeves play!), Horizon Performing Arts ([https://www.horizonperformingarts.org/shows](https://www.horizonperformingarts.org/shows)) (where my daughter performed in a few productions), and the excellent people at Professional Youth Theatre of Michigan ([https://www.pytmi.com/home](https://www.pytmi.com/home)). Anything they put on will be smashing.

I've listened to music at several Ypsi bars/eateries, and by the makeup of the crowds, there'll be plenty of friendly Ypsi-ans. So check out these (there's much more): 734 Brewing, Haabs (the Depot Town Big Band!!!!), and of course Triple Goddess Tasting Room ([https://www.facebook.com/TripleGoddessTR/events/?ref=page\_internal](https://www.facebook.com/TripleGoddessTR/events/?ref=page_internal)). Oh heck, just checkout the Ypsi Real Events page ([https://www.ypsireal.com/events/concerts-music/](https://www.ypsireal.com/events/concerts-music/))

Finally, the drinkeries in Ypsi are where I roam and the hail-fellow-well-met thing happens to me quite often. Try a Depot Town bar crawl! Not only will your run into a friendly conversation, but distance-wise it's a park once situation. Here's the way I'd go (the best results happen when you sit at the actual bar. No side tables). Start at Thompson & Co, then Sidetrack, \[this is where Cultivate would've gone\], WaxBar, MAIZ, 734 Brewing, Stick's, Aubrees, Mash, then bask in the hubbub at Corner Brewery.

Love the AA bars. I still go to Old Town, but Ypsi's great and a much cheaper Uber ride.

"+1 for bowerbird mongo! Super neat antiques, crafts, art and knick knacks at a very reasonable price. Be sure to double check their hours, though.

While you're downtown, if you like chill places to sit and read a book the library is a nice place for that and to study. There's also a broad range of people who go there, which can make it an interesting microcosm of the city at times. But, it's real and I find it charming. Awesome and attentive staff there, too.

The taproom near by is one of the quintessential water holes of the city. Great place to be when you have nothing to do and need beer to drink and people to talk to - for better or worse lol

No bud, I'm in my 40s and grew up in a single parent household on public assistance in an 800 SF house in Ypsi Township. That neighborhood looks worse now than it did in the 90s. The town needs money, it flat out needs money.

People CAN go somewhere. It's people like you, insisting that they can't or shouldn't that are the egomaniacs.

"""U of M students, Ann Arborites""

Pretty ugly here friend. I know a lot of UofM grads, I don't know any from wealthy families. 

My cousin's parents worked as a pipefitter and at the cosmetics counter at Hudson's. My close friends' parents worked on the line at Ford in Milan and as a para-pro in the schools. Another friend his dad was a mechanical engineer at a small machine shop and he went to Willow Run HS. Another's dad worked for public works in Milan. I could go on and on. 

Not every UofM student is some trust-a-farian from Connecticut, other students are also being priced out by the cost of tuition and the housing developments aimed at wealthy students. Don't worry, very wealthy kids from California aren't going to rent in Ypsi. They're comfortable in those new high rises off South U.

"It is a deeper issue with capitalism when rich speculators and rent-seekers use cash offers to buy up housing that could be someone's primary residence. Someone could have bought that house to live in for not much more money than they are paying to rent it. All so Stuart can have some more rent serfs to make his parasitic living. Increasing people's rent a greater percentage year over year than they ever see in a raise at work. 

That's toxic for our city and toxic for society as a whole.

This idea that Stuart is saving detached homes from your own bogeyman of ""big corporations"" (as if a toxic small business is morally better than a toxic large business) or preventing single family homes from being plowed over and turned into huge apartment complexes is a canard. Big corporations don't buy houses in Ypsi. We haven't even been able to get developers to build on prime vacant land right next to downtown let alone redevelop small residential parcels as occurs in A2. When Stuart buys, he is taking away from the first time home buyer, taking away from people who are priced out of A2 and trying to find an affordable place to live in Washtenaw County.

"I mean, you're right, Beal and others who do what he does are just a symptom of deeper issues with rentier capitalism in our society. If he didn't do it, someone else almost certainly would, and we'd probably be complaining about them here. But that's also why we don't need to hold Stuart Beal up as some kind of paragon of anything particularly positive for our city or the renting public.

I feel like I can't hardly go a couple of blocks in Ypsi without stumbling upon another one of Beal's holdings. That abstract measure makes for Beal owning too much of the city in my book.

Setting aside the fact that McKinley is more in the business of operating large multi-unit apartment developments, the community of people who are actually rental customers doesn't seem to think much more positively of Beal than people do of McKinley.

We have a whole lot of demand, and I'd rather it be Beal buying up single family homes to split into rentals than McKinley or Beacon or heaven forbid American Campus coming in and insisting on tearing down a whole block to put in new construction units that are going to have even higher rents.

It's not healthy for our town for one man to own as much of it as Stuart Beal does.

It's not healthy for our town to buy up single family homes with family money and turn them into rentals marked up at 5% a year when people could be buying them with FHA 30 year fixed loans with about as much money in as a security deposit and first month's rent and be free of rent forever.

There's no links to sketchy Facebook groups, weird alternative news outlets, or opinion pieces from talking heads. The rest is opinion and a plea for U of M (a rather important institution to our community) to make a policy change. None of that violates the rules that we had before the pandemic and those haven't changed. [When they added the misinformation report feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/g21ub7/misinformation_and_covid19_what_reddit_is_doing/) they cited concerns like telling people to drink bleach or attack cell phone towers.

"I don’t know if you’re in the Ypsilanti Area Discussion group on Facebook but Councilmember Somerville (Ward 3) has shared a letter from Meyers he shared with Council documenting the timeline of communications with Cultivate. She’s also citing neighbors complaining of quality of life issues around Cultivate (presumably noise) and the tent being a fire risk. 

It’s perhaps not as black and white as Cultivate led us to believe but I still think the City is being petty here. I’m still confused why they moved the goalposts on tents. And I also don’t understand why it took one member of City Council to communicate all of this instead of the City laying it all on the table.

"Came here to link the mlive story. I read it as the prior owners putting up tents, before 2020, without permits; the tent last winter (2020-21) was put up under an old process that staff realized was inadequate as more tents popped up, and a revised process is in place now.

Sounds like the new process involves more attention to things like fire safety and egress -- which is hard to be too upset about.  I hope that Cultivate and the city are able to get those issues worked out quickly.

So the City is claiming Cultivate’s tent was never approved while approving a permit last year? This makes no sense.... Our Director/Tyrant of Economic Development Joe Meyers strikes again:

*Although the previous owners of Cultivate had erected a tent for five years, it was done without city permission, according to Joe Meyers, director of economic development for the City of Ypsilanti. Demorest bought Cultivate in September 2020.*

*The city approved a tent permit in 2020, Meyers said, but relooked at regulations for tent permits when more requests were made throughout the pandemic.*

It was caught after this permit was issued and when some of the other tents came up in the street,” Meyers said.*",t2_3zf2czqw,teamilovebread,0,1643721800.0,0,t1_hv4ny57,hv4ny57,True,teamilovebread,t3_sgqe95,https://www.reddit.com/r/ypsi/comments/sgqe95/cultivate_closing_indefinitely_citing_trouble/,"Cultivate closing indefinitely, citing trouble with the city re: the installation of an outdoor tent for winter",/r/ypsi/comments/sgqe95/cultivate_closing_indefinitely_citing_trouble/hv4ny57/,3,r/ypsi,0,3

"I would argue Ann Arbor has gentrified a lot in certain areas. For God’s sake, downtown has completely transformed in the last twenty years with tons of old mainstays going out of business like Peaceable Kingdom, Orchid Lane, et cetera (and even Bagel Fragel went out of business because their lease was not renewed); they’re not even downtown). It doesn’t matter that the students factor into it (along with Toyota, Google, etc.) In fact, a lot of the students do have a lot of money and they’re the ones spending it at these new businesses popping up everywhere. I moved from Ann Arbor after a year as a renter because I couldn’t afford to live there without having roommates and living in a slum. I couldn’t afford to live there, much less go out for a poke bowl or juice bar or whatever cool hipsters downtown do. Now I live in Detroit where we were actually able to buy a house. Do you know how inflated housing prices are right now in a lot of these “up and coming” towns? Houses in Ann Arbor are sold within a week of listing them, in cash, generally for higher than the listing. I worked for a property manager for a few years there and I saw all the dramatic changes happening.

"No, it's not.

Gentrification is like socialism, a big scary word used a lot by people who don't understand it.

""the process whereby the character of a poor urban area is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses, typically displacing current inhabitants in the process.""

The character of Ypsilanti isn't really changing, and the idiocy of the city council has existed long before and independent of the Ann Arbor housing market.

Housing in Ypsilanti proper isn't improving. There are no new developments or high rises, and all of the homes are still going on 70-80 years old. Yes, Ypsilanti Township has developments, and yes, they're impacted by the housing market, but it's a separate issue from Ypsilanti proper.

New businesses aren't being attracted - just look at the sheer amount of empty storefront downtown...including the Vu.

And I without argue current inhabitants aren't really being affected. The people selling their houses in Ypsilanti right now are by and large retirees (especially with the change in employment in the wake of COVID) and they're not really making as much money as other areas do.

And, in fact, I would argue Ann Arbor isn't getting gentrifed, either. Again, new businesses aren't reforming the town and changing it in a new image. It's still entirely dependant on the University and University housing. There's still no shortage of empty storefront. 

The houses are all more expensive now but it's not due to ""displacing current residents"" - they're leaving of their own free well because why wouldn't you get overpaid for your old houses inflated value?

Wealthier people aren't really moving in - the amount of DEBT incurred to buy a house is going up, and that's a generational issue.

The only ""character change"" is more high rises, which all target the University primarily.

"That's the problem. They're all ""well-meaning."" That couple with the artisanal ice cream shop in downtown Ypsi are ""well-meaning."" Ari and Paul from Zingerman's are ""well-meaning."" That brewery across the railroad tracks in the old commercial district that drives up the rent of adjacent spaces and is exclusively patronized by University Trash is ""well-meaning.""

I made the radical suggestion that they keep their ""improvements"" on the proper side of 23 so no more POC families are priced out of Ypsilanti. It's even starting to happen in traditionally ultra-poor areas like West Willow.

But tell this to an Ann Arborite and their eyes gloss over. ""Ice creams? And you say they're...*artisanal?""* Or they actually become angry with you pointing out the destructiveness of their actions and smugly maintain that they're doing nothing wrong and your accurate observations are the real problem.

One of them even had the gall to tell me that POC neighborhoods should be grateful for the influx of money because it means better schools. The audacity.
