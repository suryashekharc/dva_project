"This is what has me perplexed. It’s both driver problems and restaurant problems. It seems to be across times of day and different categories of restaurants; fast food, pizza, slightly more expensive, even a grocery order. I’m wondering if there is a push to get everyone back into the restaurant, and the delivery orders are not the priority? I’ve got two preschool kids that can’t be vaccinated and who go to daycare, so in the interest of public health, we don’t eat out. It’s really disappointing for me, as we love to expose our kids to lots of different cultural foods. One can only eat so many chicken nuggets.",t2_ep1yx,elleebee,0,1649002797.0,0,t1_i38lcx4,i38lcx4,False,elleebee,t3_tvc8yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/tvc8yg/anyone_else_finding_that_food_delivery_is_kind_of/,Anyone else finding that food delivery is kind of a mess lately?,/r/Guelph/comments/tvc8yg/anyone_else_finding_that_food_delivery_is_kind_of/i38lcx4/,1,r/Guelph,0,1

"Missing items or incorrect would be the fault if the restaurant so maybe try switching up restaurants? The delivery bags are sealed before they are handed to the driver so they can't even check for accuracy. I do feel that fast food places tend to be careless lately with packing, maybe there's been an uptick in orders and they can't keep up? 


I have noticed that a lot of drivers don't always follow directions well lately but I assume that's because of the very low pay and volume of deliveries. For example, we live in a basement apartment and our door is at the back. I'm home alone with a toddler so I need it to be brought to the back door or else I have to get us both dressed and bundled up and take her around the house to get it from the front porch. It's a huge pain in the butt and honestly if I was going to get us dressed and bundled anyways, I would have saved the delivery fee and just gone out. About 50% of the time they take it to the wrong door. 


I'm curious which service most use because we mostly use Skip and it's really been awful lately. Super long waits (much longer than the ETA by like 30-45 mins), missing items, delivered to the wrong door and three times in the last few months the driver has delivered us someone else's order.",t2_c64qwx5m,secondmacleod,0,1649002274.0,0,t1_i38k3e6,i38k3e6,True,elleebee,t3_tvc8yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/tvc8yg/anyone_else_finding_that_food_delivery_is_kind_of/,Anyone else finding that food delivery is kind of a mess lately?,/r/Guelph/comments/tvc8yg/anyone_else_finding_that_food_delivery_is_kind_of/i38k3e6/,1,r/Guelph,0,1

One, we had tens of thousands of flyers to deliver. That's a lot of walking. We didn't want to walk any more than we had to.

Two, some of the advertisers that hired us did not completely trust us to deliver because a friend of a friend told them they had seen our carriers dumping flyers in garbage bins.

"I has been a while, but I used to occasionally sub as a goalie for a league close by, in Cambridge, called Warren Hockey. At the Cambridge Ice Park.  It is run by a guy named Craig Warren. He usually had two tiers scheduled, the co-ed and the intermediate. The co-ed league was perfect for people who were just starting out and wanted to learn. The intermediate was for more experienced players; it was fun, non-competitive  hockey either way. Craig usually acted as ref during all the games, but went out of his way to coach people who were just starting out. I don't know if this is still going because of the pandemic, but give him a shout and see if he's still doing this:

a hands-free device (e.g. Bluetooth) but only to turn it on and off

a mounted device (e.g. phone, GPS) as long as it is secure  – not moving around while driving

""They can only be charged if they are on a highway, which includes the sidewalk and driveway into the establishment,"" says Const. Clint Stibbe, with Toronto police traffic services. ""The drive-thru, if on private property, is not included because the highway ends at the edge of the sidewalk closest to the establishment.""

That's because Ontario's Highway Traffic Act doesn't apply on private property, like drive-thrus or shopping centre parking lots.

But if you're on the road, it's illegal to touch a mobile device, even if you're stopped in traffic or at a red light. If you're caught, it's three demerits and a set fine of $490. If it goes to court, a judge can increase the fine to $1,000.

"Hello!

Since the summer time is coming up and I'm sure you're all excited for a good summer getaway, I'm here offering my services as a house sitter!  


A bit about me, I'm 20 years old and although that may seem young, I'm very mature and have been working since 17. I've always been responsible, independent and trustworthy.  I have some experience with house sitting, as throughout high school I helped care for an elderly woman in her home for 3-4 hours, ensuring her safety and medication was taken. I'm able to provide multiple references from previous jobs. 

I'm more than happy to house sit for families that have animals! Growing up on a farm, I'm very comfortable with small dogs, horses and everything in between! Growing up with 2 cats and 2 dogs, I'm very familiar with the duties and responsibilities it takes to care for animals. 

&#x200B;

Some daily benefits I can provide:

\- daily light house cleaning to ensure everything remains clean for your return (including cleaning up after animals)

It's pretty fun, good mix of guys with a wide range of athletic ability (ie, Div 1 guys can all mash the ball, but Div 3 teams are true beer leaguers).

The 2022 season is already planned, so not sure you'd be able to squeeze in an entire new team (if you even found enough guys). 

However, there's almost always a handful of teams who struggle to consistently bring out the minimum of 10 guys every game. You could try posting in the [Free Agents section](https://guelphslopitch.ca/Classifieds/), to see if any team bites on a new player.

Or, if you're an outgoing and social kind of person, you could show up on Mon and Wed nights once the season starts and wander around, asking teams if they need an extra body. I've seen it work before!

"I get that $400 seems like a lot, but there are multiple considerations here. 

1st, the job may take 20min, but it's still 1-2h out of the contractors day when you include time it takes to set up, take down, and go from one job to the next. 

2nd, They are unlikely factoring in unknown variables (worst case scenario for them). Does it just need to be screwed in, or do all the brackets need to be replaced, and new mounts put into the brick/siding. Maybe a whole new downspout is needed. They won't know until they get there and then that 20 min job is now a 2h job (plus the time overhead stated above). 

3. A lot of times contractors give outrageous quotes because they aren't interested in the job. The reality is, they could be overflowing with business and would rather take larger jobs rather than nickle and dime over small jobs. In this scenario, they threw out an outrageous number because they view it as not worth their time and effort (for their normal rate), but rather then just say so, they give a super high number because if you're actually willing to pay it, then it becomes worth their while at that price point. In other words, they don't actually expect you to take it at that price. 

I'm sorry that none of this helps you though.

Cn 542 is the same as gexr 584. Cn 540 is the same as cn 580. Both trains have been doing the same thing for well over 10 years now, working the same places with largely the same employees (they were granted a bridge into the CN union) with the same rail traffic for the same customers.

The only difference now is you may have additional weekends trains so perhaps you are simply noticing the scheduling differences and hear it on weekends more?

Also another difference is CN trains have two locomotives sometimes four instead of GEXR's one or two.

But the number of trains are largely the same on a day to day basis.

Cn crews work continental and where the gexr shortline was largely monday to Thursday working Guelph CN does work weekends and may leave a weekday out. There is also the occasional night extra as in a couple to a few times a year.

"Plastic also doesn't get recycled. It gets downcycled. Plastics change as they are reworked and as such, they become a different kind of plastic each time. You can only rework them about 5-6 times before the end product becomes unusable.

So, while you might recycle them, you are still adding plastic into the global ecosystem. Plastics have good uses, and recycling them makes the process much better, but in the case of single use plastics, there are often alternatives  where the minor downsides don't outweigh the upside of less plastic generation. Plastic bags are one of these things. 

For example, I bought about a dozen cotton canvas bags from Lee valley for about $3.50 each. They hold more than a plastic bag, can be washed, and last 10-20 years. At the end of their life, they will degrade.

I get that people reuse them, but often that use can also be replaced with a non-plastic alternative. There's just no inventive to do so because the plastic bags are already laying around.",t2_7qmio,S_A_N_D_,0,1648423314.0,0,t1_i2dez3z,i2dez3z,False,Dramatic_Marketing_7,t3_tp9in8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/tp9in8/guelph_could_ban_many_singleuse_plastics_by_march/,Guelph could ban many single-use plastics by March 2023,/r/Guelph/comments/tp9in8/guelph_could_ban_many_singleuse_plastics_by_march/i2dez3z/,7,r/Guelph,0,7

"""When people think about living near the tracks, they think of the trains passing, not idling or switching tracks for hours on end - that's not a reasonable expectation to have especially with operational activities increase without stakeholder consultation or knowledge.""

What planet do you live on? Did your real estage agent tell you this and now it's your expectation?

Did you not see the train yard or switching that has been ongoing here  daily for 170 years?

Even still the switching isn't all day or night. There are places in Ontario that have railways switching 24 7, big rail yards with roustabout shifts switching cars. Guelph is nothing by comparison.

What stakeholder consultation do do they need to have for something that hasn't changed in 170 years?

Also please explain what's changed. You think there have been increases. There have been none. Its the same now as it was when CN took over in 2019. The GEXR ran more freight in daylight before that and they took over in 1998..before that cn ran four mainline freights a day and the same locals as we have today, it was busier then, cn operated it from 1921 to 1998. Before that it was the Grand Trunk. Before that the Great Western and we Guelphites invited them both in the 1850's to our city. This is the result. 

Metrolinx is very engaged for all the changes and construction ongoing however but freight needs no consultation. This is just how it is.

You moved beside freight lines : now you demand they change for you? The vibration. Oh my. What about my poor dishes?

This wasn't a secret nor was it new. You sound like someome who was told something by your agent  and now that it's not reality you are resorting to NIMBY like activities. You're overstating everything. The idling is nowhere near as bad as you say unless once or twice a year is enough to bring out your pitchforks.

Idling vehicles.. holy shit call the police. However the railway lands are industrial and federal jurisdiction.. they idle because they have operating radios for railway communication to keep the workers safe. Those men and women are in charge of a crew and communicate to all trains for the duration of a shift and own the track. They give proceed instructions to all trains after workers clear the limits and need radios to be functional at all times to communicate between the trains, and the crews. Plus actually performing and orchestrating the work being done. Radios are critical to communication.

I lived on Kent St for a few years and quite enjoyed the noise and racket. Even when the railway ran midnight freight extras of loaded salt from Goderich. Vibrated the shit out of the house like a herd of elephants. 170 years. People who don't like as much as you  should just move.

"No I'm not ""spouting"" misinformation (that's rude). The train cars and vehicles say CN Rail on them. We've been in contact with CN Rail who have acknowledge this problem - I verified this first.

And yes I know they use water not anti-freeze (and everything else you mentioned - we did our research first) - none of this negates the fact that they idle for hours on end that cause noise, air and vibration pollution and there's been a significant increase in this activity. This idling happens all year round not just winter. Also what excuse do CN Rail vehicles (non-trains) have for idling?

When people think about living near the tracks, they think of the trains passing, not idling or switching tracks for hours on end - that's not a reasonable expectation to have especially with operational activities increase without stakeholder consultation or knowledge.

As for your comment about the 'poor' mayor - he's been responsive, supportive and an advocate. We included the mayor and other city workers because CN Rail only works with the city (not residents). Just because things have always been done the same way (often polluting) doesn't mean we should continue doing it the same way - sometimes it takes 'complaining' to get action and in this case, the 'complaining' as worked to some degree because they're meeting about this. I was suggesting having more people affected voice their concerns could help.

Instead of jumping to conclusions and accusing and schooling someone, please try to get your facts straight first.  Do you live in close to the tracks to be affected?

"There have been mininal increases in freight traffic.

In fact when CN took over in November 2019 they ran the Toronto  night freight daily. Now its 3 to 4 days a week with extras as needed. They only run one freight from Toronto.

The freights from Cambridge come 6-7 days a week but in daylight, arriving at dawn, departing afternoon after delivering freight to the Guelph Junction Railway.

The Freight from Kitchener is about 5 to 6 days a week as well, also daylight, and they deliver traffic for the Cambridge Guelph customers then go back to Kitchener. Twice a week this train goes to Canwel in Acton.

Overall the freight traffic is steady.

In 2003 there were two big derailments down in Burlington. Now this brought all the traffic: we had 30 trains a day go thru Guelph for a couple weeks. Half were big freights the other half were via's going around the wreck.

"So, you're spouting misinformation. Sorry to say.

The mainline is owned by Metrolinx. The majority of vehicles that park at the junction belong to Metrolinx's contractors which are usually PNR but can be from any contractors.

There are a ton of contractors that have been here for the last few years due to the ongoing upgrades and it's about to get even busier: Metrolinx is putting a 2nd mainline track from the station to the Hanlon and will be a major night time construction project. This is why they have been building new track and more rails and ties are coming. 2 miles of track is to be laid.

CN has little in the way of vehicles or people other than a passing train and the occasional project because they own the secondary branchlines that are little maintained. The CN folks did just upgrade their yard by edinburgh and paisley to bring it to a safer standard after the last railway neglected it for 20 years. This was also clearly communicated in the paper and local media.

Trains from Cambridge have to wait at the Junction for permission from Metrolinx to cross over to go to North Guelph and they may wait an hour or two and yes they idle.

Sometimes a train will park somewhere in the rail yard or by the Junction building because they ran out of time. They don’t have to tell you when this happens or ask your permission as the railway was here a hundred and seventy years before you. The Galt and Guelph railway yard was built in 1855.

It is the exception not the rule that any locomotive parks at the junction overnight and idles. The folks by Eagle St in Preston are where the trains park every night most of the time and yes they idle there too. They have it every day.


Locomotives must idle in the winter as they cannot use antifreeze. Their engines use water and if the water freezes the engine block will crack and this is fatal to the block worth $250,000

In the spring summer and fall they can shut them down and they do. Sometimes with ztr smart start they will turn on periodically to warm up and shut back down. Ztr smart start was invented by a London company and most railways use this now. But not all have it.

Squealing noises are caused by flanges of wheels when freights work. If this bothers you so much you may need to think twice about living at the Junction.

It's the idling that's the problem because of the vibration, noise pollution, air pollution - there's also the horrible screeching noise as they change tracks and blocking of traffic that can last for hours and it's only getting worse. 

Trains idle for several hours a day. 2 years ago they had train idle for 1 consecutive week (no exaggeration) over the winter holidays with no warning to residents. CN Rail vehicles also idle for no good reason - e.g., 3 pickup trucks idling for over an hour with windows rolled down and AC in the dead of summer.  CN Rail takes no accountability or responsibility for any of this despite many complaints. So much for the anti-idling bylaws or trying to reduce emissions and fight climate change :rollseyes:

I would highly recommend people email CN, the city and ombudsman - the more complaints, more likely they'll do something about it. contact@cn.ca; ombudsman@cn.ca; mayor@guelph.ca",t2_3o5o7yi0,RoughInside,0,1648344048.0,0,t1_i29g1w2,i29g1w2,True,scylla07,t3_tozrqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/tozrqg/train_noise/,Train noise?,/r/Guelph/comments/tozrqg/train_noise/i29g1w2/,1,r/Guelph,0,1

"I have been thinking like you for 20 years. My time is all part of it.  I plan the most efficient routes to where I need to be. For example my wife will decide to go to wal mart. I could go to north end Guelph wal mart. 10 mins each way.

But if I am going to visit my parents in Stoney Creek soon we will just go to the Centennial wal mart as it is 1 minute off the route. Saves me 20 mins. Of course i am already going down there. But it is not my usual decision making process.

Do the same with trips in town. Why make multiple trips? Consolidate it all into one as much as possible so you aren't going too far.

Some folks go groceries multiple times a week. We plan and have a set night. Once a week no more. We reuse bags and may do other trips at same time such as bank or dollar store both on the way.

But the thing is I also used to commute too. I got a job in town so I no longer commute. Saved $3000/year in gas doing that and oodles of time. So the point is you need to move here is your next step :)

"Right. But you're driving to Georgetown and Guelph to get groceries. You're wasting 70 km of gas roung trip to Guelph. At an average 10l/100 you used 7 litres of gas or nearly equivelent in weight and volume  of 5 bags of milk weighing about 10 lbs.

10 lbs of burnt wasted gas and money versus about 100 grams of cheap plastic bags.

The most efficient thing to do is buy local and re-use your bags as I do. I reuse them as much as I can. Or better yet ask them not to bag them and as you are trying to do bring your own bins or boxes.

I appreciate your want of efficiency and environment but this seems like a wholly backwards pursuit. The bags are nothing to the gas and vehicle wear and tear doing all that driving.

"Efficiency and environmental.

If you look at bags:
They need to be manufactured and shipped.
Bags need to be purchased and continually stocked at grocery stores.
Clerks need to load the bags which is more work than loading a few big reusable bins.  I realize this is offset by them unloading the bins.

When I get home I carry in my bins with bags inside. Then I need to unload the bags individually and dispose of the bags instead of just taking groceries out of the bins.

The bags then need to be picked and processed at the dump.

"Yeah, my wife and I have tried Georgetown SuperStore and Orangeville Zehrs.

Georgetown Superstore switched to using boxes instead of plastic bags.  I was hoping they would switch to nothing.  Now I have an entire blue bin of boxes to break down weekly.  Over the phone I asked them about it and they said they were willing to to remove the groceries from the boxes, however when we arrive we get a lot of grief and resistance from the staff to remove the groceries from the boxes.  I realize its not the workers, this is more an issue with the company policy itself.

Orangeville Zehrs is still using bags.  Before covid they did a bin swap.  However, not everyone keeps their bins clean.

"You can't just put up drywall and call it a day.

First you'll pay the permit fees. One for apartment application and another for drywall finishes per sq ft. They'll advise you on what you have to do. There are certain codes that have to be met. If your basement was finished before 1994 you'll be in column a where your requirements will be less. This is the legal non conforming part..note i said finished.  If you have 3 or more bedrooms in the legal non conforming you can probably keep it too.

If your basement is unfinished see below.

If after 1994  and before 2001 things get harder: window wells and sizes for egress have to be bigger. Plus driveway requirements. And max 2 bedrooms. Many landlords get around this calling one bedroom an office. Shady but possibly legal

2001 or later are even more difficult: you also need a parking space and a few other requirements are harder.

In all cases:


You'll have to submit drawings of the layout you will create and they'll advise you if it meets code or not. You'll have to adjust as needed and work within that framework.

The fire department will come to advise on fire barrier requirements. You'll have to add that too.

Then you'll have to arrange electrical safety authority to inspect for two units and this will be BOTH upstairs and down. And you'll have to adjust and make those changes.

All three will have to inspect and pass before permit closed and registration completed.

When its all said and done it will depend on many factors for cost timing and your contractors.

You only need engineering if you plan to modify support walls or foundation for whatever reason such as a seperate entrance. You can also get engineer to make drawings for you if you can't. I did my own.

Also when it's said and done your property tax will slowly go up by a total of $1000/year for the increased assesment value. So if you pay 4k in property taxes now and your neighbor who has the exact same house today and doesn't have a basement apartment, you'll pay $1000 more a year once its fully phased in.

If you choose to not do this beware: guelph actively trolls for illegal apartments and tenants call them in too. You'll be caught just a matter of how many years. I was. Thats why I know :) and they will make you conform.

Good luck",t2_aka7d,headtailgrep,0,1648140372.0,0,t1_i1y8i3l,i1y8i3l,True,nanphan_,t3_tmjepa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Guelph/comments/tmjepa/basement_renovation_help/,Basement renovation help!,/r/Guelph/comments/tmjepa/basement_renovation_help/i1y8i3l/,6,r/Guelph,0,6
"First a question that can substantially impact cost

Is the basement going to become an accessory apartment (self contained and seperate from the main floor unit)? If so all sorts of extra zoning requirements, registration fees and fire seperation apply

As far as permits go, you'll need to submit a permit application, and FULL floorplan drawings detailing the following...
-Room dimensions 
-window sizes and respective dimensions to window well, grade etc.
-type of wall and ceiling finishes
-location of stairs doors, smoke alarms, plumbing fixtures, heating outlets

Egress windows are something you will require if the basement is non-accessory, and has bedrooms.

Inspections associated with your permit will include:
-electrical (ESA)
-plumbing
-hvac for any major duct rework
-major demolition


You can apply for permits through the Cities online permit application system found on the City website

"I actually helped build some of the homes out on Claire road development  a few years ago near the movie theatre. 
My question with inflation though is just because Canadians are making more money, why does everything else have to go up as well? It’s not like everyone will start to go out and spend all of their money. The point of higher wages would be to allow us to actually afford normal things, not the extracurricular. 
Wouldn’t prices being raised be because of owners or whoever decides, thinking oh everyone has more money so I’ll just charge more now? Not because everything actually got more expensive?

"I'm not claiming to know the answer - not sure if there's even one but I do believe this brand of capitalism we're practising is no good, nor is it sustainable (it's way worse in the US). I think what some European countries are doing is a more balanced approach. It's a mix of capitalism and socialism (it also drives me nuts when people equate socialism with communism). 

IMO - anything that that is a necessity in life (food, shelter, education, health, utilities) should NOT be run as a for-profit business or privately to help ensure everyone has somewhat of an equal access to basic necessities in life. It should be run with the sole purpose to provide a good or service, with a built in  R&D model to improve efficiency and innovation (which is often the excuse for privatization). Everything non-essential can operate in the ""free"" market (it's not really free, just a illusion). 

I also think we need shift away from the notion that certain jobs are better, more elite (doctor, lawyers) where others are deadbeat jobs (e.g., the arts). Working with our hands, farming, construction trades, etc. are noble professions. We need a mix of everything no job is more important. But so many go into jobs just to make as much money as possible, and/for class/status and try to compete with each other - never satisfied because we're always seeking happiness, validation and self-worth from external sources. This IMO is strong cause in mental health illness.

We also need to shift away from this idea that environment is ours to control, dominate and exploit. We should respect it for the substances it provides. Run amok, capitalism detracts from this and it feeds on insecurities and exploitation of people and nature.

"I've written a series of articles about these issues. I'd post them on this subreddit, but I'd get bounced if I did. But I can put a couple ideas out there: 

1. the population of Guelph has increased by 30% in the last 20 years, which increases demand
2. because people can drive to work, one city Council can't fix the housing problem themselves because if a lot of houses get built people will just move to Guelph and commute to work somewhere else. The problem needs to be solved on a provincial level
3. the complaints about people who own homes complaining and stopping new higher density housing are a problem all across North America---if not the world. The problem is that people who already own a home vote in municipal elections and show up at Council meetings----and the people who don't do neither. 
4. the provincial govt set up a panel of experts called the Ontario Affordable Housing Task Force who have come up with a whole long list of very good recommendations. I would suggest everyone on this list politely tell everyone running in both the municipal and provincial elections to adopt all of the suggestions and implement ASAP
5. DON'T JUST VENT ON LINE----IT ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING IF YOU DON'T ALSO GO TO COUNCIL, CONTACT YOUR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND TELL THEM YOU SUPPORT THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS, MENTION THEM IN THE ELECTION, ETC. 
6. Get informed (if you know who I am, you can look at my news blog---Guelph-Back-Grounder). When you talk to the politicians don't complain about their raises or accuse them of being in bed with big business. They are generally good people (if somewhat ideological or uninformed). Don't get angry. This isn't about you being a good person---it's about being heard. When most people talk or read something, they don't respond to what you say, but rather the emotions you use to say it. Anger just turns off most politicians and you might as well be just playing a trombone (like the Charlie Brown cartoons) for all they will hear of what you say.
7. Its a tough time to not own your own home, try to organize and help one another if you can. It's too bad, but one of the things that really brings out the nasty ""I don't give a damn"" part of middle class people are property values (the other is their children's education).
