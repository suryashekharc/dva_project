Get a specialist ASAP. That will likely get you out of the hospital paranoid zone about opiates.

"Yeah bud, big time sorry but you're not getting any opiates for your wife by going to the ER.

If she really wants to be on opiates, she needs to find a compassionate pain management doc (of which there are very, very few). Also please be aware that based on her situation it will almost certainly start a lifelong addiction that very well could one day lead to an overdose death - the docs definitely aren't wrong about the opioid crisis and overprescribing in the 90's/00's causing a huge surge in the opioid crisis. I'm not saying your wife will for sure abuse her meds, just saying that once her body gets used to them it will be absolute hell if she ever gets cut off from her script or anything - it's how a lot of ""legitimate"" pain patients end up on heroin these days. 

Your best bet imo is either ask around for a decent pain doc (at most she'll get maybe 30-90 Vicodin a month, better than nothing but likely not enough to live a normal life) or maybe try alternative like CBD/CBN or THC if she doesn't mind the high that comes with the pain relief",t2_1n4e9ty1,donedrone707,0,1649004289.0,0,t1_i38oyi3,i38oyi3,True,tryayahuascaasap,t3_tv13mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tv13mf/ucsf_er_terrible_service_stanford_er_slightly/,"UCSF ER Terrible Service, Stanford ER Slightly Better, Herniated Discs, Extreme Pain",/r/bayarea/comments/tv13mf/ucsf_er_terrible_service_stanford_er_slightly/i38oyi3/,1,r/bayarea,0,1

Also, there are vastly more young adults in the LA area than up here.

"First of all, you are wrong about the vaccines being not effective for under 5. Pfizer's trial showed that it produced good immune response for 6mo-2yr kids, just not 2-5yr. The only reason it hasn't been approved for under 2 group is fucking bureaucracy. Regardless, there is also a Moderna trial that is ending soon, so chances are good this year for one to pull through.


Second of all, you are not the parent or the pediatrician of my baby, so you have zero idea of our potential medical situations. You have no right to be giving medical advice. We will listen to the professionals.


Third of all, we vaccinate our kids for all kinds of shit. Want to compare to the flu? Yea we vaccinate our kids for the flu, and the flu vaccines are way lower in effectiveness than covid, and the flu is much less serious in children than covid.


Fourth of all, there are not enough studies looking at potential developmental problems due to infection and long covid in kids. Sure, it may be comparatively low chance of complications compared to adults. But what is that chance? The fact is everyone assumed covid isn't serious in kids only looking at number of deaths, even though NICU hospitalization records kept making the news with every wave.


Fifth of all, how do you know whether anyone in my family is immune compromised or not, or whether we have other medical issues? Are you my doctor? Why do you give a damn at all about whether **other** people wear masks or not?


Last of all, why do you give a damn about *our* goalposts at all? We looked at the facts and considered what we do and don't know, our medical situations, considered our risk tolerances and spoke to our doctors and pediatrician, and we came to a conclusion to do things accordingly.

Seconding all the advice about taking your wife to see a specialist. I had horrible pain for 2 years due to a herniated disc. I could only stand for 5-10 minutes at a time.

"The ER does not provide ""service"".  They are there for emergencies.  If they had a 6 hour wait then there were people there with real emergencies, like their guts hanging out from a trauma, and they need to be prioritized.   The Dr did you a favor not giving her narcotics for back pain.  It leads to addiction easily.  If you don't like it, then contact your politicians, because their new laws in CA have made it difficult for doctors to prescribe narcotics for this type of issue.    Usually herniated disks will resolve without surgery (95% of the time) and the pain goes away or mostly away after 6 months.  If it does not, then microdiscectomy can help.    The best treatment is to move as much as possible and stretch, and take NSAIDS such as Motrin and also Tylenol for pain.  Your doctor can talk to you about appropriate dosing.  Moving and walking around are by far the best way to make the pain resolve in this first few weeks.    If she lays in bed it will just keep hurting.

"We used to go snowboarding here at Sierra when I was stationed on active duty in the Bay Area decades ago.

In case you didn't know, Sierra at Tahoe was damaged in the Caldor Fire last August. We were anxiously following the fire in the news. My friends were forced to evacuate. Sierra and other resorts in the Lake Tahoe area were even using their snow making machines to fight the fire.  Sierra remained closed this season due to the damage. There is a Go Fund Me for the employees who lost their jobs, but it is now closed. Thank you for allowing this post.

"Transmission fluid and filter do need to be changed every 30k miles or so, so that one is legit and needs to be done.  But a plain drain and refill shouldn't be anywhere near $900 even with MBs marked up filter and fluid (I strongly, strongly recommend making sure that the fluid you use meets the required spec code listed in the manual).

Yeah, AMG rotors are stupidly expensive due to low volume production and high performance.  Those quiet back-to-back stops from 150mph to zero come with a big price tag.  Not as bad as the carbon brakes on Aston Martins that cost $5500 for a single rotor though.

As for the sunroof, I recommend asking on MB fan forums about that one.  It may or may not be a much simpler fix.

"I had a bulging cervical disc (c7-t1) in December 2019. The pain was amazing. I had good experiences at Sequoia & Stanford ER (or ED as hospitals seem to call them now) over 3 days. Got morphine with an oxycodone prescription the first time, and dilaudid the 2nd & 3rd. Had to spend the night in Stanford hospital on the 3rd night. First time I'd ever slept in a hospital. Went away with prescriptions for gabapentin, flexeril & oxycodone, and some lidocaine patches. Also was told to take tylenol. That managed the pain while I waited 10 days for surgery at Stanford.

Having done a lot of research I lobbied my neurosurgeon for a disc replacement rather than a fusion to preserve some motion and to put less pressure on adjacent discs. She said she'd try, but at that level it can be hard for the fluoroscope to see through to the spine because your shoulders can get in the way and mine definitely did.

She respected my wishes however. After surgery she told me while laughing a bit that she had to have two guys pull my arms down toward my feet as hard as they could to clear the way for the fluoroscope. It worked and I'm really glad I pushed for it.

Look, I'm never going to be 100% again and still have smaller bulges on 2 other discs, but I was in terrible pain and I'm okay over 2 years later. I've had to scale back on the hard exercise I used to do, but I still work out and more importantly I've changed how I use my laptop and read. I'm pretty convinced I caused the problem with awful head-forward posture while working on my laptop. I see the way we all do this and look down at our phones. It makes me fear for everyone's cervical discs. I do these things reclined or even lying down a lot now to take the pressure off my spine. And a huge help has been just using an adjustable lap desk. I have [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CY1LY89/). Cheap and effective.

As for the drugs, like i said oxycodone didn't help me that much and I'm not prone to opiod addiction apparently. Gabapentin, however, is awesome for me. It's for nerve pain so that makes sense since the bulge was pressing on the nerve root. I still have mild flare-ups if I go too hard on weightlifting or running, but they're nothing like those 3 terrible days in 2019. I asked my surgeon's office for another Gabapentin prescription for those episodes and got it. They offered me all the drugs, but that was the one I wanted.

"> Selection of the single bore configuration represented a recognition that the traditional method of building underground rail, through the use of twin-bores and cut and cover stations, is not always appropriate, especially in dense urban areas. This type of construction involves large excavations to build the underground stations, which disturbs the vast network of existing utilities that lies beneath the street’s surface and causes extensive utility relocations. These construction activities are very disruptive at the street level, and the resulting traffic impacts overall mobility in the community and can leave the local businesses inaccessible or difficult to access as well.

"The proposal OP has is to use another train with standard guage to meet BART at Milpitas. So BART would be left as is today with the Berryessa station. But at Milpitas passengers could transfer to another  train(for example as they do with the DMU to get to antioch). And potentially theyd suggest using Caltrain or ACE instead.

> Also, rebuilding the entire station with a separate 3rd rail track devoted to BART is very costly, more than what they thought the estimate would've been.

Im not an advocate for this idea at all but major rebuild of diridon station is already going to occur  anyway to accommodate HSR and/or BART. I dont think that would be an argument against the idea.

"You have little to learn from an electrician who typically does not know how electricity works.  Electricians are only taught what must connect to what to protect human life.  Fundamental and relevant concepts (such as impedance and equipotential) are not taught to technicians.

That electrician has no idea why an SMSP is so robust.  And that 120 volt electronics, many decades ago (long before an IBM PC existed) must be unharmed even by voltages up to 600 volts.  Another standard he need not learn.  Since he is only taught what must connect to what.  And not taught why.

Electronic power supply filters AC power.  Then converts all 60 hz and other electricity into DC voltages.  Then filters it again.  Then converts that into radio frequency spikes that exceed 300 volts.  That, now, is 'dirtiest' electricity.  Then that 'dirtiest' power is converted, by galvanic isolation, regulators, and more filters, into the most stable and safe low DC voltages.  That do not vary even 0.2 volts.  SMPS are required to be that robust.

Electricians are never taught this.  Accurately noted was why all electronics are so more robust.  Why all portable electronics must operate on all AC voltages all over the world - from 85 volts to 265 volts.  Electronics were required to be that robust.  And are now more robust.

Power supplies are so robust for the same reason that Class D amplifiers are so robust.  Electricians are not taught any of this.  Since none of this involves human safety.

"Just an FYI, the ER is meant to rule out life threatening conditions and prescriptions for opiates for pain are not happening anymore. It sucks, but thankfully she had no life threatening condition and was able to be discharged. Hopefully you guys will make an appointment with a neurosurgeon/primary care physician, etc to get this dealt with. Good luck. But just remember, sometimes not everything can be done in the ER and NOT being discharged is generally a sign that there is a problem. 

Also, saying you had bad service at UCSF because of a long wait is not really fair or accurate. Wait times are by acuity, how many ambulances there are, and how many potentially life threatening issues there are. Pain, while extremely uncomfortable, is by itself not life threatening.

"I think it's usually after they can see the seriousness of your condition. Also usually doctors you see personally are more likely to prescribe than er doctors from personal/others experience. 

the reason my PCP gave. A doctor that has seen a patient multiple times knows them better. They are also able to be contacted for issues, and discuss the medication with the patient through messages & visits if necessary. So they can feel more confident if the patient can handle it, and while they are taking it.While an ER doctor has never had any contact with them before, brief contact during care, and none after DC.

I'm not sure about data though tbh.

Personally I guess it might have to do with my age, and also my issues are recurring.

"When the toll collector positions were getting slashed at the beginning of the pandemic, I read a local article saying they’d be offered other positions with the state DoT.

It’s not like there’s a “toll collector agency” that’s on its own little island in terms of government jobs. For roles that aren’t very specialized or niche, the government can very easily move people around as necessary to accommodate staffing changes.

EDIT: Usually those employees tend to follow where their original work went. So for this example, with collector roles getting slashed, a much higher amount of cars are getting invoice by camera, so there’s an increase of demand for workers needing to review toll booth camera footage, look up license plates, and prepare invoices.

Unpopular opinion - driverless taxis will never work. Too many unpredictable variables. Driverless semi trucks will but could require new depots off highways and real drivers will take loads from there through city streets. Also there's way more upside to semi trucks as they won't have to follow the normal maximum daily hours driving rules i.e. goods will arrive faster. The only upside for these taxis is higher profit margin. But Uber losses are their own making. It's not like taxi companies lost money before Uber.

"What approach did you use? I got p=.00001 as my result. This is the perfect example of the frequentist or classical mindset gone wrong. This is a real event that is highly improbable. It's like telling the guy who down at the bar, that said he won the 80m prize in the lottery, two days ago, that he is lying because the probability was so low. He then buys you a top of the line electric scooter to prove that you are wrong. Later, on your way home on your scooter, late at night, you swerve hard because you almost hit a person, laying in the road, but you realized after that it was maniquin laying in the middle of the road.

"How many miles on the vehicle?

Just for laughs, what did the dealership quote for all that?  Or are those just maintenance schedule items?  The only one I wouldn't defer is the transmission fluid and filter change.  You don't need to do a full flush.  Just drop the trans pan, change the filter, and replace the drained fluid with fresh.

What about the brakes?  Is it only the pads?  Or are the rotors worn under spec as well?  Yeah, AMG rotors are hideously expensive.

Motor mounts are not that big of a deal.  If they are worn, you'll have more noise and felt vibration, but your motor won't fall out or anything.

Modern sparkplugs will last to 100k miles unless there's something else seriously wrong with the engine.  Ditto the same for ignition coils.  If one of them is on the way out, check engine will light up with a misfire code long before you run into any real problems.

Flex disks?  Those dampen up the rotation between the transmission and the shaft to the rear wheels.  Have the mechanic inspect them and replace if badly worn or cracked.  Ditto the same for the drive belt.

"I have some insight into that exact situation for a company that may or may not be this company in the video. I may or may not work for that same company. Explanation (sorry it is long, but this needs to get out there).

Not at first, because they only train the car with lawful behaviors, however, once deployed, the car continues to train in a unsupervised approach with data that it collects from the cars it observes. The problem is that the developer designed the network to output a boolean when it should have been a continuous output as probability of safety. This resulted in any action the car observes that does not result in death or a major injury of a human being classified as ""true."" This developer was fired for ""other reasons."" He didn't leave any documentation, and didn't use comments, didn't even use the correct language (He used a esoteric language that is designed for the only purpose of being impossible to read) as required so fixing this situation wasn't possible. It had something to do with taking the special toilet they installed for him at the office.

So, yes. It does the California roll, perfectly.  This was a byproduct. It learned it from human drivers.

Bonus background material:
One car had to be destroyed because during it's first test run, it got stuck right at an intersection because an illegal sideshow started in front of it. After 10 mins of observation, it joined in and started doing donuts with incredible skill. It outperformed the other drivers, and it was voted the winner of the event. Everyone celebrated and the car was encouraged to drink from a bottle of hard alcohol. The car was instated as the new leader of the gang. It was running away from the cops with it's newly found friends, headed to the after party, but it chugged a bit too much hard alcohol to look cool, and it ran over a discarded maniquin that someone had spilled red paint all over it previously.

"Yes VTA is a car first organization, frankly i imagine theyre bitter about being saddled with the transit agency for the whole South Bay(or at least they have no ambitions about transit). To them the car is the past and is the future. Its easy to see from their projects list that automobile projects are what they focus on(cause thats where the easy money and approval is considering federal and state). So yeah they dont want anything to interfere with their precious Santa Clara corridor(which id bet ends up being involved anyway). That said double bore would probably be longer than a year and historically has digging up major corridor has had an painful impact on communities and businesses around that. The stories are not positive of BART being built along Market and Mission. It was the right choice but how they handled it back then clearly was not.

I like the attempt but i would assume that VTA had already considered it and didnt pursue it. Railroad companies have different priority and have two lines through San Jose is better than having just one. I suggest you make a public records request to VTA on the planning of it - probably a lengthy EIR. Or just to get in contact with someone who was a part of the planning to ask why they didnt use the yellow line.

"First, that sucks.

>So they gave her a very small amount of morphine, some valium, some lidocaine patches, and some steroids. Didn't do a damn thing.

It's hard to find blame with a doctor not wanting to prescribe opiates if they're not doing anything. That just sounds irresponsible considering the risk.

That aside, I don't think doctors jump to surgery for herniated disks. My dad has gone through several herniated disks in his life and surgery was only an option after waiting many weeks while taking NSAIDs and steroids. My understanding is the surgery is a last resort because it has a relatively low chance of improving quality of life.

">why instead of tunneling a new VTA or BART line they don't just run trains linking BART and Diridon along this existing track from Milpitas to Diridon?

Because BART wants a direct connection into it, as it's where all the commuter and regional trains congregate. It's a natural hub, and BART needs to serve hubs to have riders.

"The robot will kill someone and will kill someone in ways a human can't plausibly think up. Ask yourself how many wagon wheel makers ever tried to break a human spine six times wrapping it around their work, then look up Chinese lathe accidents on Youtube. The less humans involved with machine decisionmaking the more likely accidents are going to be worse. And, honestly, I don't want self-driving vehicles on roads I walk on because that interrupts my business of walking with vehicles that have no regard for my safety and which are designed to make money, not make safety.

This underpins *all* machine operations, good and bad, and is why automated equipment is usually given it's own special zones where it's environment can be controlled.

"The vaccines weren't approved for kids under 5 because they werent effective in kids under 5. Also young kids are the lowest risk group for covid, and the vaccines aren't that effective against omicron for catching, it, just preventing serious illness, and serious illness is extremely rare in young kids(the flu is more dangerous for young kids than omicron)

And I'm not some anti vaxxer, I'm triple boosted, but that is the facts currently.

Paxloid would likely only be prescribed in serious cases, which is very unlikely if you are vaccinated anyways unless you are immune compromised.

"hey there I run 19hz.info, I'm sure you have seen the giant list of promoters at the bottom, consider poking around those if you're looking for more sources.

There are sometimes problems when trying to distill entire discographies into small snippets. How do you pick what is shown? I would just link media directly from the artists' pages or their social media accounts instead of (seemingly) random youtube videos. For smaller artists, you can probably directly message them and see what they would prefer to be listed. Musically speaking I know soundcloud and bandcamp embeds can be very compact so that might help with some other comments

I'm glad you include links to other sources but I also think you should set up a database/table to directly link to artist pages instead of using general ""<website>/search?q=<name>"", especially for smaller/local names who may be harder to find with blanket searches

If the idea of making an artist database interests you, please PM me as I have been doing little bits of that kind of thing for years with 19hz

"No, it won't be forever.


We are waiting a bit longer, because there are important things in the near future that can and will happen that will allow us to go back to being more normal. First is that kids under 5 still do not have a vaccine, and we know it is coming soon. Second is better treatment, specifically Paxlovid the anti-viral drug by Pfizer, which is still in extremely low supply everywhere.


Both of which we expect to happen this year.


When the kid gets vaccinated, we can start mingling with other families more indoors. Then when Paxlovid supply is no longer an issue and/or better longer lasting vaccine becomes available, we may go back to completely normal without masks. For now, we will simply do what we know works and has worked for us, which is just wear a mask when outside the house. It is so stupid easy to do, and is the best defense we have against getting the virus.


I know a lot of folks like to think covid is endemic now, there is nothing more we can do, and people need to mingle. And that's fine, you do you. But not everyone has the need to mingle, there are those living with older people or kids under 5, and so there will be people who choose to continue to take precautions regardless of whether it is required or not.",t2_5f7fk,smexypelican,0,1648958323.0,0,t1_i36mz7o,i36mz7o,False,old_gold_mountain,t3_tumo3c,https://www.reddit.com/r/bayarea/comments/tumo3c/so_stoked_to_see_first_friday_back_in_such_a_big/,So stoked to see First Friday back in such a big way,/r/bayarea/comments/tumo3c/so_stoked_to_see_first_friday_back_in_such_a_big/i36mz7o/,1,r/bayarea,0,1

"My wife and I bought in the Santa Cruz mountains and moved out of our loft in sf. The mortgage with property insurance and taxes at our new place is cheaper than our place in sf. I was able to quit my tech job and take a break to raise our new son.

My wife's work is still fully remote. Her totally optional commute into the office is faster now driving than it was taking Caltrain down from sf. She might go to the office a few days a week depending on how many of her coworkers go into the office. It looks like it's going to be a while before they make the move to try and get the employees to show back up at the office.

We went from a 1 bedroom in sf to multiple acres of trees. We have no intention of moving out of our house until our son goes to college. I might return to work at some point mostly so we can retire earlier than our current target date, but I totally don't need to. If I do go back to work I get to be really picky about the job I take and it will absolutely be 100% remote optional.

It's been great so far, and it's so.. so nice not being on call for work anymore. Not having to baby sit 5 years of someone else's tech debt has been amazing. I highly recommend living the life you want instead of grinding yourself down to a nub in the coding sweatshops in San Francisco bumping elbows with team members because the execs have hired so many workers each person only gets 38 inches of desk space.

"I lived in Mountain House for awhile. Back when home prices were under $700k it was worth it if you have a family- basically no crime, walking distance schools, more money for the kids. People who worked in Fremont or San Jose usually drove to Tracy to take the ACE train (but at that point, why not live in Tracy?). There's literally nothing to do there though. It gets hot as hell there (I think it got to 115 last summer), and if you want to take your kids anywhere to do anything it's a long drive. Once the kids become teenagers they get bored out of their minds, and now the house prices are barely any lower than the Bay area so there isn't really a point to the commute. The safeway and shopping center will be completed soon but it's still not a mall, not something for entertainment. This is only worth it if you have a job in Livermore or a fully remote job forever. I expect once people realize this stuff housing prices will go down again.

"Watching the video several more times,  I didn't see the Cruise car drive on the wrong side of the yellow line.

"Honestly, wait to figure out his job situation before you try to find a place. His job could lead to any of the following scenarios:

1. He works for a tech company that allows 100% wfh, so you can live in SF proper. 

2. His company offers a shuttle, meaning you’d ideally live along a shuttle route. 

3. His company has an office in SF, so you’d live in SF. 

4. His company is only in SJ and has no shuttle, so you’d likely live near RWC or Daly City and take public transit into SF for your job.

"Overall, it was good!

* Their 7 day return policy is as stated, very easy to return with no hassle. No questions, got all my money back in days after initiating the process.
* The process felt a little clunky. It was a little disjointed between what I did on the website, and the several people I spoke throughout the process on the phone. No major issues here, just a little tedious having to explain where I was in the process to each person I spoke to.
* I don't know why, but if you buy the car outright on the website, the reps told me that I would have to pay for the $250 delivery fee. However, if I opted for a Test Drive, they would  deliver the car to me for free. So, I opted for the test drive and bought it from the rep who drove the car to my location for me for the test drive.
* While my car was in transit from the South SF hub to me, it got a rock chip in the window. I had to do a little haggling with the rep. (who talked to his supervisor), and I got a couple hundred off. There was light pushback, but overall it was a non-contentious haggle.

"Good experience on more than one occasion, would do it again, and would recommend Shift to friends and family. You’re paying less with Shift versus a dealership, and a little more than private party prices but you get convenience (huge pain to buy a car off Craigslist). They inspect their cars so I never bothered to get pre-purchase inspections and never had issues. Used car prices today are inflated but that’s not Shift’s fault, it’s supply and demand. Expect to spend 4 hours at their South SF location from start to finish if you plan on going there to get your car (bring a book), depending on how busy they are and how many agents are on-site.

There’s also Carmax, I recommend them too, they’ll be cheaper and less sketch than a dealership, and charge more than Shift. Carmax is a huge nationwide operation, all they do is used cars.
