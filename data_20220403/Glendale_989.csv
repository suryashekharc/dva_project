"Living in Citrus Grove now; walking to the front of GHS is part of my regular exercise routine in the morning.  I see people walking all the time; I figure one should be okay as long as they stay away from the 2 underpasses on the border to Eagle Rock.  

From my experience: the one-way street in Maynard can be a pain.  Sure, it’s just one street, but it seems to be enough to cause some inconvenience when parking near GHS.  If you don’t have your own spot in a carport/garage, parking tends to suck.

Speaking of parking near GHS, there’s no parking in front of the school from 7 am-6pm (except for a small strip in front of the auditorium where one can park for up to 30 minutes between 2 and 6).  So if you don’t arrive too late, you can often find a spot in front of the school, though the spot you find may be a bit of a stroll from home.  Not to mention that you’ll need to leave that spot before 7 the next day.

When school is in session, certain times of day before and after school that section of Broadway eastbound in front of GHS can be slow, from people picking up/dropping off kids then using it to get to the 2/134.  That abated a lot because of the pandemic, but I can imagine it coming back as life normalizes.

Beyond that, it’s Glendale.  Police patrols are plenty, and with GHS there it’s probably a little more frequent than other parts of town.  The CHP headquarters are in the area, too.  So relatively safe, and also the place to be on good behavior when you’re driving.",t2_cic8x,bluebirdgm,0,1648425445.0,0,t1_i2djgen,i2djgen,True,WeCaredALot,t3_tprmgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/glendale/comments/tprmgl/anyone_familiar_with_the_citrus_grove_area_of/,Anyone familiar with the Citrus Grove area of Glendale?,/r/glendale/comments/tprmgl/anyone_familiar_with_the_citrus_grove_area_of/i2djgen/,5,r/glendale,0,5

Also one of the only houses around that has a basement let me ask you what you think of this…
When I first moved in there was an antique door hidden in the basement opened it and there were 2 wood shelf units just stacked with empty glass jars, pretty nice jars too but then again everything old timey is quite nice. Years and years of agriculture failing in a large portion of our yard we decided to dig deep into the roots to see what in the world is wrong with our soil. Layers of broken glass jars and bottles!

"All  I’m gonna say is best of luck on your recovery and as far the negotiations….Prevacid and when I was younger with no job, really nothing, I had racked up a hospital bill. They had thrown in some stuff that I clearly said don’t perform on me and they didn’t perform it but still charged me. The physician who saw me first was visibly disgusted of the scar I attained and barely did a thing before making me wait another 3 hours to get wrapped up and had no idea what they expected me to do with my situation so because of that 

I decided to write to finance and visit and everything to say “you know what I’m not financially able to pay this all what can you help with”.

 Long story short, they had me fill out all this paperwork and then told me to bring it back in. I went 3 days in a row and the person that was supposed to receive my paperwork wouldn’t be at work. I waited 3 or so days and went back in and finally got it approved. they took the bill down about $500 …. I figured finance helped me with $500 I’ll get $100 pastries, those glass Starbucks drinks for the entire finance department and office snacks.

"I didn't have to escalate it to a grievance but it did take a follow up call to Kaiser after the company in Sacramento (I think) sent letters stating they didn't receive payment from Kaiser and I was now responsible.   I called Kaiser again (maybe twice) to make sure they sent the check and then I called the billing company for Glendale (in Sacramento) to get verification they got it.  That's when I learned I would still owe $18 (and some cents). 

I might note that I was taken from Glendale Adventist to Kaiser Sunset and admitted for 8 days so they couldn't really say it was an unnecessary ambulance ride (and they billed me for another $15k in services not covered by my health plan for the various costs for getting sick while being fully insured). 

None of these companies are interested in NOT sending you letters demanding payment.  I think if I didn't follow up with both parties I would still get letters demanding payment for the necessary ambulance ride.

>You’re asking all the right questions. There’s a place in Glendale called El Sauz Tacos on San Fernando Boulevard at Chevy Chase. It started off as a taco truck from the same owners. I would go when I was in high school. Then there was a place across the street, like a little hut, that they took over, where you could sit and eat. They got rid of the taco truck then. It’s still there. They also have a #2 location in Glendale, on Colorado.  

>You can’t go wrong, it’s fresh, it’s clean, delicious. The homemade salsa alone is to die for. I would get extra salsa, bring it home, and put it on other things. I usually get four tacos and a burrito. But I haven’t done that in a while. I’m trying to watch my weight, watching what I eat, because when you get older, you can’t eat the same amount and look the same. Nowadays, I’ll go and either have a burrito or four tacos, instead of having all that together. I do the carne asada, but recently changed how I eat. So now I’m doing a little al pastor and grilled chicken. But every time I think of El Sauz, I think of the carne asada with onions, cilantro, and that salsa. That’s just the way it should be. Period.

* He was in the process of getting banned from BJ's Brewhouse for a period of actions over two days, including him hitting on every female bartender, leaving his credit cards without signing his bills, and literally carrying out full glasses of beer outside then leaving the premises drinking them, never coming back.

">It’s going to be repurposed in the future.

> idk what a good alternative was to the development

Literally anything else, lol. A nice park would be 1000x better for this community than a parking lot that will sit empty for 12 hours a day. There is an elementary school across the street, and an A+ bakery a block away. A place to sit after you grab some Art's and wait for your kid sounds pretty good.

An actual college campus would be mindblowingly good. I think this is what really has gotten me outraged – I thought that's what they were building! Campuses are usually walkable and incorporate mixed use zoning, plus arts and outreach etc... GCC Garfield, on the other hand, is *gated.* Like, there is a *locked gate*. 

I appreciate that parking was bad, but there is a city-block-sized parking lot for CCHC right next door that is near-empty during peak continuing-education class hours. The fact that none of these [exhaustive planning documents](https://capitalimprovements.glendale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GCC_Garfield_InfoFlyer_06292021.pdf) mention this lot is dumb and bad.

Sorry for another screed. I am super duper pro education, especially the kind that this campus provides. But this is just such an obvious misstep, it really bums me out.",t2_ap4rc,yupandyes,0,1647535807.0,0,t1_i11epje,i11epje,False,yupandyes,t3_tflar1,https://www.reddit.com/r/glendale/comments/tflar1/glendale_community_college_parking_lot/,Glendale Community College PARKING LOT!?,/r/glendale/comments/tflar1/glendale_community_college_parking_lot/i11epje/,2,r/glendale,0,2

"I sort of agree with you (it’s stupid, parking is dumb, death to cars, build more housing, etc). 

That said, it’s a parking lot *for now*. It’s going to be repurposed in the future. The parking lot is the plan for the near future. Demolition is expensive. It’s basically in a holding pattern now and can be used for another building or 3 once GCC has CapEx to do it. 

Also, while it sucks to lose the housing, some of which was quite interesting looking, idk what a good alternative was to the development. GCC had a huge parking problem and wasn’t able to accommodate all the students before the pandemic. I don’t think it’s a bad thing for GCC to have an actual campus.

I got my help from the system I was once homeless for a bit. I'm not trying to dehumanize them it's just now we have homeless people just more aggressive than ever.

"This is a tough one because a lot depends on how clean/dirty your neighbors live, but a few general rules will be extremely helpful.

* I've lived in a few of the ""modern"" ridiculously expensive apartments in West LA and Silver Lake. No issues beyond house flies.
* The higher the floor the less likely you'll deal with pests.
* When you tour an apartment, make sure you to ask them to show you the garbage bin area that sanitation picks up from. Some places let trash pile on and spill on the ground creating easy targets for mice and roaches.

But again, if your neighbor is a slob, then their sloppiness will attract bugs that will seep into your home. Sucks, but that's the nature of pests.

"Glendale is a city of diversity, a city built by immigrants mainly of Armenian, Mexican, Filipino, and Korean backgrounds. It's a city that has undergone a lot of changes over the last decade with the building of the Americana. It has attracted many businesses and unfortunately many racist white people along with it over the last decade or so. 

Some things the city is particularly proud of include: the Americana, Glendale galleria, brand Blvd, brand park, verdugo park, Glendale community college, Kenneth village etc. The old Glendale is generally south of Colorado Blvd down to Adams Hill.

Glendale is flanked by Atwater village, silver lake, echo park, eagle rock which are young hipster hubs. Further east is Pasadena which has some good night life.. west is Burbank which is mostly Armenians and White people and a historic city with a strong Hollywood background. 

Night life in Glendale is exclusively on brand Blvd with a handful of bars open fairly late. The city is run by greedy people and Glendale has some of the most crushing metered parking in the world with meters running til midnight and heavily enforced. Koreatown has some great night life as well but it's not an ideal city for meeting strangers if you know no one.

Genuinely curious- do you honestly think that solely because someone can afford to come up with bail makes them less of a risk for release pending trial?  If this guy could post $150k bail you’d be ok with letting him out now?

Why should poor people, for the sole reason of not being able to post bail, be denied the ability to be released prior to trial like those who can post bail?  Shouldn’t the criteria simply be one of public safety or likelihood of not showing up at trial?",t2_3xwrjomj,BlooDoge,0,1645366476.0,0,t1_hxpdr15,hxpdr15,False,[deleted],t3_svo9kf,https://www.reddit.com/r/glendale/comments/svo9kf/man_arrested_3_times_within_16_hours_in_glendale/,Man arrested 3 times within 16 hours in Glendale,/r/glendale/comments/svo9kf/man_arrested_3_times_within_16_hours_in_glendale/hxpdr15/,2,r/glendale,0,2

Trespassing, loitering, pedestrian infractions etc are no reason to hold a poor person in jail. Zero bail is good.

"Wikipedia snippets:

Western Armenian (Classical spelling: արեւմտահայերէն, arevmdahayerēn)\[2\] is one of the two standardized\[citation needed\] forms of Modern Armenian, the other being Eastern Armenian. It is based mainly on the Istanbul Armenian dialect contrary to Eastern Armenian which is mainly based on the Yerevan Armenian dialect.

Until the early 20th century, various Western Armenian dialects were also spoken in the Ottoman Empire, especially in the eastern regions historically populated by Armenians known as Western Armenia. The spoken or dialectal varieties of Western Armenian currently in use include Homshetsi, spoken by the Hemshin peoples;\[3\] the dialects of Armenians of Kessab, Latakia and Jisr al-Shughur of Syria, Anjar of Lebanon, and Istanbul and Vakıflı, of Turkey (part of the ""Sueidia"" dialect). Sasun and Mush dialect is also spoken in modern-day Armenia villages such as Bazmaberd and Sasnashen.

Forms of the Karin dialect of Western Armenian are spoken by several hundred thousand people in Northern Armenia, mostly in Gyumri, Artik, Akhuryan, and around 130 villages in the Shirak province,\[4\] and by Armenians in Samtskhe–Javakheti province of Georgia (Akhalkalaki, Akhaltsikhe).\[5\]

As mostly a **diasporic language, and as a language that is not an official language of any state, Western Armenian faces extinction as its native speakers lose fluency in Western Armenian amid pressures to assimilate into their host countries.** Estimates place the number of fluent speakers of Western Armenian outside Armenia and Georgia at less than one million.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eastern Armenian (Armenian: արևելահայերեն arevelahayeren) is one of the two standardized forms of Modern Armenian, the other being Western Armenian. The two standards form a pluricentric language.

Eastern Armenian is spoken in Armenia, Artsakh, Russia, as well as Georgia, and by the Armenian community in Iran. Although the Eastern Armenian spoken by Armenians in Armenia and Iranian-Armenians are similar, there are pronunciation differences with different inflections. Armenians from Iran also have some words that are unique to them. Due to migrations of speakers from Armenia and Iran to the Armenian diaspora, the dialect is now very prominent in countries and regions where only Western Armenian was used.

"Like I said, it's lost all meaning. It's about race, not ethnicity. Or maybe you're right as people now seem to believe, a word can change meaning just because someone says so. But it's always been about race, not ethnicity, until the last couple of years with the new prejudice plus power definition.

Let's see how Merriam Webster defines it.

1 : a belief that **race is a fundamental determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.**

As for the rest of your comment, if you think Armenians are not members of the caucasion race, I guess that's your opinion.

If the ""white boys"" (talk about a racist epithet) are talking shit-- it ain't about skin color. I could be Armenian by my looks (or Jewish, or Italian, or Persian) and I don't get shit from anyone. How would they even know looking at you. Why do you suppose you got shit from people? Was it just asshole high school kids? You all need to grow up.

Like I said, if you make no effort to fit in, then don't be surprised when other people are put off. If I moved to Armenia, you can bet I'd be learning Armenian, listening to Armenian radio, watching Armenian media, learning to read and write Armenian, and attempting to fit in. Not trying to find the few people I can live with and never learn the customs of the country I've chosen to live in.

"I agree that the word racism has lost meaning along with many other words like fascism....

Racism : prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

Given the literal definition of racism above, being a part of the Armenian ethnic group makes it ""cultural"" as you have noted, still making it racist. 

**""Sure as hell look white.""** - spare me and us, please. All the white boys who've talked shit to me over the years and who I've had to tell to fuck off would disagree with you. 

**""People prefer that when others move here, they pick up the culture just like our parents or grandparents did""**

Spare us, again....""This is my town not yours""....How many generations does it take for people to assimilate? It takes about 3 generations which could be about 90 years. Armenians have been trickling in to LA since the 80's and there is a long way to go. If you want fully assimilated Armenians go to Fresno or to Boston where Armenians have been there for a 100 years after the Genocide. 

**""just like our parents or grandparents did""**....assuming you are white (possibly LatinX), white people aren't even fully assimilated given the land stolen from the Native population. You still call black people Black or African-American when they have been here for 400 years (as long as the white man). You call Mexicans and Salvadoreans LatinX. Fucking spare us with your bulshit assimilation that takes 100's of years to make one people out of many. 

**""I don't see a lot of love coming from the Armenian community.""**

Why are you deserving of any love, cause they are on your land? 

""Glendale is my town not yours""

"It's not racism, unless you think Armenians are some other race than white. Sure as hell look white. People throw that word around like water now. Its starting to become meaningless.

So, not racial. It's cultural.

People prefer that when others move here, they pick up the culture just like our parents or grandparents did. If you behave, live, work, play, associate only with your own culture and don't try to assimilate, don't be surprised when people find that off-putting.

"I love you and am so happy you've had a positive experience with Armenians..this subreddit is overflowing with racism against Armenians because of the driving habits of some people. 

I agree, I cannot stand the hipsters and find that Glendale and Burbank are safe havens in LA.

Another area that hasn't hipsterfied is koreatown. This leads me to believe that it is the decision of hipsters to not live in areas where rent is high but is made of ethnicity other than white. 

Areas like frogtown which were lower income areas with Hispanic majority have become havens for hipsters, which are pushing for zoning laws and props to evict the multigenerational Mexican community there so they can have their la colombe. 

This wouldn't work in Glendale because generally Armenians can afford to buy the higher costs moreso than the hipsters can.

"Hollywood was a very very rough place to be  in The 80’s and 90’s. A total shithole with a lot of culture but man, what a violent place to grow up. 

When my mother came to LA as a teen(Jamaica) they moved to East Hollywood in the Russian area. She said the Russians were so kind to her. She said she moved to Glendale when she was 16 and went to Glendale High. She said she was spit on and beat up by the white kids, even by boys. They hated her. My family left Glendale quickly and moved to Echo Park where they stayed. 

She moved back to Glendale after the  “white flight” that happened in the 80’s when the she remembers the Armenians and Filipinos started to move in. She said she wanted to be back near Russians again. She thought aremenians were all Russians but we learned the history of the diaspora as to not say stupid stuff anymore.

Most groups eventually assimilate because you kind of have to here, but the way Glendale has set itself up it creates an oasis of ethnic groups just minding their business and just continuing on being Armenian or Filipino (or Cuban or Panamanian)without the stress and pressure the US puts us to “become white or else…”

"I believe you’re talking about broadband internet, for which the two big names in Glendale are Spectrum (the main cable provider) and AT&T (the phone provider); unless you’re near a fiber source, your AT&T internet will be through a DSL connection and will be slower that Spectrum’s, but if you *can* get a fiber(optic) connection you can get faster speeds (for perhaps more money, you’ll need to check).

“Wi-Fi” is the technology that allows your devices like laptops and phones to connect wirelessly to your broadband internet connection.  This sometimes works with a device already integrated into your modem (the device that already brings the internet into your house) in combination with a router (managing the connection of multiple devices to one Internet connection) in the modem.  What some people do is that rather than pay a surcharge to have the Wi-Fi as part of their modem, they buy a separate Wi-Fi access point, plug that into the modem, and configure it so that they can access their internet through their own router.  One will have to buy the wireless access point initially, but if the service charges monthly for the built-in wireless access point, one now may have the option to take that service off of one’s bill.",t2_cic8x,bluebirdgm,0,1640909877.0,0,t1_hqm8kp3,hqm8kp3,True,emememin,t3_rsdfjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/glendale/comments/rsdfjg/wifi_options/,wifi options?,/r/glendale/comments/rsdfjg/wifi_options/hqm8kp3/,2,r/glendale,0,2
