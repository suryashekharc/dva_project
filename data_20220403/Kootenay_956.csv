"Here's the thing about it.  If you are all-in on the rural lifestyle, and you have a job that lets you work from there, man, it can be purely paradise.  But it's a small town.  Really small.  Being there in the summer doesn't really prepare you for the winter experience, which is long, dark and isolated.  There will be issues with school - teachers you don't like - limited pools of friends for you, for your wife and your kids.  Limited range of activities.  No movie theater without driving, few places to eat out, that sort of thing.

But the positive tradeoffs are immense.  Just taking the dog for a walk and you are in a place of immense natural beauty, surrounded by breathtaking mountains, in clean air and by a lake of pristine water.

There is 4 elementary schools in the area, one high school, and one alternative school that blends a number of the younger grades and well I don't know much about it other than it is parent run (Wildflower).

It's a quickly growing town, since there is no ski hill and it isn't right on a lake (25 minutes away) or river (walking distance) it just never caught the same boom Fernie or Nelson did but it is in full growth mode now.",t2_gwantp7g,seemefail,0,1647611555.0,0,t1_i15iiw9,i15iiw9,True,BassBossVI,t3_tgsa7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/tgsa7n/moving_to_the_kootenays_kaslo/,Moving to the Kootenays - Kaslo,/r/kootenays/comments/tgsa7n/moving_to_the_kootenays_kaslo/i15iiw9/,6,r/kootenays,0,6
"I went to school in New Denver, which is also k to 12.  You have mostly the same classmates all through school, and are likely in a class of 20 or less.  If you like them its great... But there aren't a ton of school electives later on.  It's better in the younger grades.

Baseball won't be an option, but soccer and basketball will be.  Camping, hiking, skiing, canoeing possibly hunting will all be much more accessible than team sports.  

The area has tons of musicians and artists, so music and art lessons are certainly available.  Kaslo has an amazing jazz festival which will hopefully start again soon, and a lively music scene.

That said, expect to drive a lot, often over very bad roads.  Shopping is quite limited and Kaslo is deeply remote.  The road to Nelson is one of the worst I've driven in the winter and I've driven everywhere in BC and the Yukon.  Amazon makes up for the limited selection somewhat, but you have to learn to make due.

If you want to bring your kids up in a safe, clean, beautiful place with (lets be honest here) mostly white folks and a liberal dose of various kinds of kooky, it's amazing.  Work is hard to find, so more people don't do it, and you expect your kids to grow up and leave, but I liked it just fine.

The drive from Kimberley to Cranbrook as a commute is not long by any city's standards, but it might be a deal breaker in winter.  If you have kids, schools are also a thing to consider.  If you have friends in one place already, that may play into it.

Cranbrook is certainly improving in many ways, with new restaurants and shops.  They are both still small towns, really, and the services are not perfect in either.  

To pick a town based on ""vibe"" or what activities you might do once a month always seems strange to me.  Whichever you pick, I'm sure you will find that both towns have their appeal, and the beauty of both is (imo) the closeness to the outdoors, not the towns themselves.

I know people who chose Kimberley due to the ""vibe""/assumed politics or the restaurant/bar scene, then spent 90% of the their time in Cranbrook for work and social life.  There are great people in both towns, regardless, as well as the standard assortment of not great people.",t2_22grndvo,caffeinated-bacon,0,1646844493.0,0,t1_hzzonto,hzzonto,True,christopher1479,t3_t9zxnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/t9zxnw/kimberley_vs_cranbrook/,Kimberley vs. Cranbrook,/r/kootenays/comments/t9zxnw/kimberley_vs_cranbrook/hzzonto/,6,r/kootenays,0,6
"Kimberley doesn't really have a homeless population or much crime other than out of towners or skid kids occasionally doing dumb stuff. Pretty much everywhere in Kimberley is safe. Very small town with a nice community. They call cranbrook ""dinktown"" or ""cranbrooklyn"" for a reason haha. Lot's of homeless have sprouted up in cranbrook over the last few years and drugs are becoming more of an issue. I have a friend who lives in a shady area of cranbrook and his wife actually gets scared by her neighbours. If you need to do any shopping cranbrook is only a 20min drive away too so they're both pretty close to each other. Cranbrook def has nice areas of it but everywhere in Kimberley is nice. Also, it might be worth checking out Marysville - it would cut your commute to cranbrook by about 10 minutes. It's technically south kimberley but in reality it's about a 7minute drive to the downtown core of kimberley. Slightly longer summers too - a nice in between.

"I’m certainly biased. I moved to Cranbrook originally, and about a year later bought a house in Kimberley and commuted to Cranbrook for work. Town has better vibes, easier to meet like minded people (that is likely dependent on what kind of person you and your spouse are). You will end up having to go to cranbrook for certain amenities (shopping, Heath care, restaurant variety, etc), but I find day to day Kimberley is a better place to live. 

The other poster gave some solid feedback, albeit I may not agree with all points. Skiing is obviously better in Kimberley. Golf is great. Tons of recreational opportunities honestly available in either city or within 15 minutes (lakes, hikes, trails, etc.). 

Ultimately, you will likely spend time in both cities regardless where you buy your house. Do you want to live in a more industrial, spread out, highway town like Cranbrook and have an easier commute , or do you prefer a smaller, quaint ski town like Kimberley and driving 30 minutes to work each way?

"I live in Kimberley and much prefer it over Cranbrook.  I’ll do my best to be objective and not let my bias slip through.  If I worked in Cranbrook, it would be a tough decision but I’d probably still pick Kimberley.

Goods and Services: Advantage Cranbrook.  Kimberley has some great small shops, two bike shops, a fantastic outdoor store,  hardware etc but most your retail needs will be met in Cranbrook.  I’ve never compared, but I’m pretty sure groceries are more expensive here than Cranbrook.  Kimberley only has two banks: Royal Bank and the Credit Union.  Although I bank with Tangerine and haven’t set foot in a branch, ever, so not a big deal I guess.  Both cites have climbing gyms.  

Medical: Advantage Cranbrook.  Only a weekday, business hours medical Center in Kimberley.  But neither is great.  Need a specialist?  Have fun driving to Kelowna or Calgary.  

Restaurants:  I’d actually say it’s a tie.  More choices in Cranbrook but nothing spectacular.  Less choices in Kimberley but a couple really great places (notably the Pedal and Tap and the Bauernhaus)

Mountain biking: I’d give it a tie, more variety in Kimberley but a much longer season in Cranbrook

Nordic and Alpine Skiing:  Massive win to Kimberley on this one,  Way longer Nordic season.  If you want to ski both Fernie and Kimberley resorts, then advantage Cranbrook.  

Backcountry skiing:  Slight advantage Kimberley.  If you don’t have a snowmobile, your options are limited to driving to Tunnel Mountain or Kootenay Pass, both of which are closer to Cranbrook.  If you have a snowmobile, most of the skiing is up the St Marys valley, which is closer to Kimberley

Politics:  Depends on your leaning.  Kimberley has more folks left of Center than Cranbrook.  

Feel of the city:  Advantage Kimberley.  Probably my bias, but Kimberley just has a way nicer feel to it.   

Airport:  pretty much equidistant from each city

Housing:  Maybe someone else can expand on this one.  I think your dollar will go further in Cranbrook but longer term you might see more appreciation in Kimberley because it’s a resort town.  It’s not something I keep tabs on so I could be off.",t2_5zbt6hef,Timrunsbikesandskis,0,1646804027.0,0,t1_hzxte0t,hzxte0t,True,christopher1479,t3_t9zxnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/t9zxnw/kimberley_vs_cranbrook/,Kimberley vs. Cranbrook,/r/kootenays/comments/t9zxnw/kimberley_vs_cranbrook/hzxte0t/,18,r/kootenays,0,18

"My former spouse is from Fruitvale and I have spent the better part of two decades exposed to the Kootenays.

I love Nelson, Kaslo, Crawford Bay and Kootenay Lake.  A fun trip in the summer is to check out Sandon.

My kids live in Creston.  I drive through the Kootenays every few weeks to visit from Vancouver.

The schools in Fruitvale/Montrose feed into JL Crowe in Trail where the biggest academic achievement to celebrate is just graduating.  The bar is very, very low.

Trail is a company town dominated by Cominco.  You are either in or not.  Well paying jobs outside of the smelter or Celgar are hard to find.

There is a bridge over the creek in Fruitvale, just behind downtown.  Go walk there and listen to the kids, it is not a hopeful place and the most exciting thing is a bush party at The Pend Oreille Dam.

Fruitvale is beautiful.   The drive along Columbia Gardens Rd out to Waneta is lovely.

Maybe Fruitvale has changed but I grew up in East Van and volunteered on the Downtown Eastside and I didn't encounter assault, drugs, marital infidelity, weapons, arson and even murder (out in Ross Spur but still Fruitvale) like I did in and around the community of Fruitvale.

The Kootenays are amazing and special and beautiful but it also has an underbelly that isn't pleasant.

Hope that helps and is expanded enough.

Kimberley is far smaller but (in my opinion) a more enjoyable / upbeat place to live. There’s beautiful walkable areas and shops and you can pretty well walk or bike from one side of the town to the other.

Cranbrook is more of a city location meaning a larger population, more stores and brands, a mall, vast neighborhoods and long streets. Cranbrook is a more convenient place to live for work or shopping and many people who live in Kimberley work here.

"I think that the advice given here has been pretty good.  Perusing this sub, you’ll see plenty of similar posts and also varied advice based on personal experience.  For instance, some people say Creston is their favourite place to live, while others think it’s terrible and full of old people.  Everyone has an opinion, and the local town facebook groups tend to highlight the dumbest of those.  
  
At the end of the day, it should come down to what amenities you want and what is affordable to you.  
  
High speed internet is everywhere, from fibre to starlink.  There are a lot of places that were on satellite or mobile/cell hubs up until last year, which are now on fibre.  There has been a lot of talk about transitioning certain communities to focus on digital economies in the Kootenays as well.  
  
If you require access to an airport, some areas are better than others.  If you have certain medical requirements, same thing applies.  If you need access to certain schools (you didn’t mention kids, but it’s something that does come into planning for many) some areas are better than others.  
  
Hiking and mountain biking are everywhere in the Kootenays, though some spots are better than others.  
  
The politics shouldn’t really come into it.  That may seem like a crazy thing to say to many people, but even with conservative voters in Cranbrook, BC is still NDP.  So there’s limited sway.  The reasoning behind a lot of those votes going to conservative is up for debate, but I would hazard a guess (from my experience) that a lot is to do with a focus on mining/oil/gas jobs rather than actual conservative beliefs.  That, and a sense of being “forgotten” by Victoria (something I have heard many times).  
  
There are plenty of very left to far left leaning people living in Cranbrook, for instance.  There are plenty of causes to get behind, if that is your thing.  There are people from all points on the political spectrum around.  
  
There is racism around everywhere.  There are plenty of towns in the Kootenays where it has been historically VERY white.  As noted by others here, there are growing ethnically diverse groups around.  Cranbrook has a group which sponsors refugees, for instance, who have absolutely loved their new home.  
  
I have a number of friends who were born and grew up in other continents, and love the Kootenays.  
  
I moved to Cranbrook years ago after I was offered a job there.  I didn’t know where it was, I had never heard of it.  I found the community to be eclectic and interesting.  The town has changed drastically in the last few years, with plenty of new shops and restaurants.  House prices have gone up, but so has the quality of the town (many would disagree, but if your idea of high quality food is BP….).  
  
At the end of the day, the focus should be more on what will make you happy daily and not what will make you happy once a week or once a month.  That being said, nothing is “too far” and you can live in Kimberley and work in Cranbrook (I know you work remotely, just making a point).  You can live on property an hour out of town on a lake and still have good internet.  And outside of the pandemic, you can get on a plane and fly somewhere else.

"What is happening is others are doing this and dramatically changing the culture and landscape of these places.

To a degree that most locals are priced out and are forced to move elsewhere. These areas are quickly becoming little Torontos/Vancouvers.  Farmers markets are quickly becoming like the farmers markets you would find in a large city and no longer a real community based event.  It is happening all over to these beautiful little towns and uprooting the original population As outside buyers flood the markets and outbid anyone in the area.  

This is also putting a huge strain on municipalities that are nowhere near equipped to handle such an influx of population and adverse mindsets that come with those looking only to satiate their self focused agendas, Nelson is ridiculous to park/drive in especially in the summer.

When/if you find a place be sure to give back to the community and not just exist for your own endeavours.  As places like Kimberley, Nelson, have seen a drastic cultural shift and the lack of homes/rentals are now raising all prices not just housing and we are seeing a drastic rise in our homeless population with no supports to mitigate them effectively.  These used to be fantastic people helping people communities but are now at war with a “me-centric” mindset that tends to win as the original population dies or moves away.",t2_61ewxcma,Save_Parks,0,1642873950.0,0,t1_htroikk,htroikk,True,[deleted],t3_sa6k2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/sa6k2e/future_living/,Future living,/r/kootenays/comments/sa6k2e/future_living/htroikk/,2,r/kootenays,0,2

"Hi,

I live in Creston. This is a hell of a place to raise kids. There is a nice modern community complex with a pool, hockey erena, curling rinks and a pretty affordable gym.

There's a new micro brewery and even a speakeasy nightclub called the frisky whiskey (unique cocktails still cheap as a regular drink at Boston Pizza or other) that both have live music and events.

There are cherry, apple, peach, and other orchards all around. Tons of fresh food most of the year. Really a decent spot for a 100 mile diet. You don't even need to have your own fruit trees, from my experience if you get to know peoe they will let you pick it for free. An active farmers market, in fact a lot of the vendors in the surrounding communities FM vendors come from here too. 

There is 3 or 4 elementary schools in the area and one high school. Hockey, soccer, basketball, baseball teams for all ages. The lake is not far. An hours drive to 3 major ski hills. Also Kootenay pass summit if you get into back country skiing or want to snow shoe.

Weather is nice. This year is a bit of a amply but usually snow doesn't stick to the ground until January. No snow last Christmas. I love the effect of walking around in a sweater to buy a few things I. Town on Christmas eve, then driving 40 minutes away to go ski at the winter wo derlad that is the Kootenay summit.

People are saying rude things about the people of Creston but you can say things about any town. Invermere is full of vagrant sleeping in cars, a lot of trail is a slum due to low cost housing on accou t of gross chemicals from the smelter for so many years plus huge drug problem, Cranbrook you can hardly feel safe going for a beer and every other day someone is on the buy and sell because their vehicle was stolen there, Salmo is a backwards place and on and on.... 

All those places are probably wonderful to live in and raise a family.

The top of the Kootenay Pass has lots of terrain on either side. It's fairly popular so avalanche info on the area is usually pretty reliable. The AvalancheCanada app will also generally have some reports. (Obviously nothing can be deemed 100% accurate, and your results may vary)

Past the Kootenay Pass toward Nelson at the Whitewater ski area has lots of terrain, and in previous season you could get a one trip ticket to get you over the backside. 

The area around Red Resort, in the Rossland Range, also has some great skiing. You'd be accessing off of the Nancy Green Highway.

"I agree about the move towards wealthy tourists.  When I said Kimberley was aiming to be another Nelson, I think Fernie is likely a better example.  I was thinking food scene, but that is also apt for Fernie.

There are definitely blue collar workers in Kimberley, just as there are hippies in Cranbrook.  The two towns have a very different vibe, however.

I appreciate that you have lived there for 30 years.  You've seen the end of the mine and the downturn afterwards when you could buy a house for under $200k.  And then the influx of younger people and the new housing developments.  

I am simply speaking from experience as an outsider, and the transition that I've seen in the last few years.  You and I probably have different views of what ""hippy"" is as well.  But a vegan restaurant in Kimberley would probably do better than one in Cranbrook, same with a crystal store.

There have also been plenty of young professionals moving there to start families since I've been here as well, same in Cranbrook.  Lots of professionals who work in Cranbrook commute.

I was only speaking from experience, and that experience has come from exposure and what I've been told.

"I spend a lot of time in both for work.  They both have a certain charm.  It depends on what you are looking for as to which would be ""better"" in any aspect.

I'd argue that the scenery is better in the East, especially through the rockies.  The different towns have different appeal, and from my handful of years here I've noticed plenty of changes.

Cranbrook gets a bad name for being redneck, somewhat understandably.  It is a blue collar industrial town that has zero town planning and clearly has had no foresight for decades.  Over the last few years, however, there have been improvements in small ways with new small businesses and restaurants.  It's a slow improvement.

Kimberley has gone from a suffering town after the mine closed to a hippie town to now an attempt to be a small Nelson in many ways (property prices not yet there).

Fernie is still the standard of what a postcard ski town in the area ""should"" look like (hence the use in various movies).

Radium, Invermere and Fairmont are all trying to expand with movement away from the lower mainland to cheaper housing etc.  

Golf plays a huge part in many of the East Kootenay towns as the valley in between the Purcells and the Rockies is protected somewhat by the weather, so there are more sun days (or some other weird metric) in Cranbrook than the rest of BC etc.  I'm not into golf, but many people are.

The West has Nelson and beautiful lake towns.  It also has Trail (:|) and plenty of weird cults up the slocan valley.  There are plenty of rednecks and those with outstanding warrants in the West.

If you're looking for world class hiking, both East and West have options.  Same with skiing.  Same with scenery.  Same with mountain biking.  If you're looking restaurants, Nelson beats Kimberley.  If you're looking for camping I'd go East over West.  If you're looking for an art scene, probably the West.  If you're hunting, the East.  Mining, probably East.  

The East gets more winter and summer influxes of red license plates (Alberta) and the associated cashed-up-redneck shenanigans.  

There are definitely positives and negatives to both.

"Lived in both, they are both ""The Kootenays"" from anyone that doesn't live there. Very unique corner of BC.

West is more lush, mild climate. East can be quite dry and crisp in the summer, less snow in the winter but colder.

Cranbrook definitely has it's rednecks but the surrounding wilderness area is the top notch of the Kootenays.

Nelson is it's own thing. Definitely some hippies in the hills near there. The artisans and culture in towns like Kaslo, Crawford Bay, Nakusp are amazing and can see why people would prefer the west when they are travelling through.

"Silver Star and Big white are fairly similar size and amenities and both have lots of on hill accommodations. Snowboarders prefer Big White as Silver star has too many flat spots/traverses. Silver Star however is known for its Nordic trails and Sovereign lake nordic centre is just down the road. Big White does have some nordic but not as extensive. However, not far from Big white (on the other side of hiway 33) is access to the Kelowna Nordic Centre [https://kelownanordic.com/](https://kelownanordic.com/) which is also great.  Silver star is lower alpine more meadow  type terrain so tends to be better if early season or not much snow coverage (less rocks sticking out!). But we really do prefer the terrain at Big White, particularly Gem lake area. Its known for light fluffy powder.   


If you went with Silver star, it would be more direct to take hiway 6 and the ferry across to Nakusp to get into the Kootenays.

"From a product and technology perspective, it's mostly the same, in my experience.  The main differences come from the branch staff, and who you get along with.

Most of the small local credit unions are served by Central1 Credit Union for their enterprise services like online banking (Member Direct), so they all feel familiar.  The larger ones with more branches might have their own systems, and feel more like a corporate bank, as well as having more CC options.

But it depends what experience you like.

"Paramedic here, I've worked in both the east and west Kootenays. The big regional hospitals are in Trail and Cranbrook they have Trauma beds and ICU's . Trail actually did a massive upgrade to their ER over the last 2 years, and their ICU about 5 years ago, both are now state-of-the-art. Cranbrook's ICU is very modern as well. 

There are also smaller regional hospitals in Grand Forks, Nakusp, Nelson, Creston, Invermere, Golden, and Fernie. As well as even smaller health care centers with some Emerg capacity in Castlegar, New Denver, Kimberly, and Sparwood. (I may be forgetting some).

There is a huge staffing issue for hospital staff as well as paramedics, so that is something to keep in mind. If you live in a more rural area it is not unusual to wait +30min for an ambulance, if the snow is bad you might have to either wait for a plow truck to show up or for Search and Rescue to evacuate you on a sled. If you are in a city/town (like Nelson, Fernie or Cranbrook, etc) response times should be under 10 min.

Let me know if you have any other questions.",t2_exr3f,ruralpunk,0,1633534423.0,0,t1_hfm4yex,hfm4yex,True,feralyouth,t3_q2jqwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/q2jqwa/hospital_access/,Hospital access,/r/kootenays/comments/q2jqwa/hospital_access/hfm4yex/,14,r/kootenays,0,14

"Depending on where you live, you might be waiting quite some time for an ambulance. Rural stations have paramedics on a pager system (at least they did, might have changed) and they have to be within 15min of the station. So, 15 min to the station + getting into gear + driving to you + then assessment + then driving to the hospital. Time really adds up quick. Major hospital is Trail. Nelson has a smaller hospital but if it's serious they'll send you to Trail usually. Then, if it's really serious, you'll get sent farther afield (Kelowna). I think Cranbrook has a major hospital too but not too sure. Outcomes for things like strokes and heart attacks for rural residents, I'd wager, are significantly worse than for people living in cities. If you live in a place without a rural ambulance station, they'll have paramedics at the station on shift so you're response time will be less.

For medical specialist appointments, I know people that have to drive to Kelowna or even the lower Mainland for that because those services simply don't exist here.

"Be prepared for long drives to get things. I grew up in the country so it wasn’t a shock for me, but it’s a shock for many folks to go from being in a  metro area of millions to nobody. 

Cranbrook has just as bad a drug/homeless problem for its size as Vancouver does, but like zero resources. 

Everything costs a fucking mint out here compared to the city. Groceries were more expensive, gas isn’t much cheaper and you need a fuckton more of it. The choices in the grocery store are so much more limited. I hope you didn’t love fish much because the quality is piss poor. Trout is pretty good out here and that’s about it.

The price of restaurants out here is the same or more than Vancouver I find, which again, surprising.

Everything is done on Facebook groups. 

It’s more conservative than you might be prepared for.

It’s very very transient given how expensive it is. More liberal folks can’t stay and work opportunities are just loads better in the city. 

Be prepared for how shitty healthcare is. If you or your family members are women don’t use the clinic in Cranbrook because a doctor that routinely sexually assaults patients and there’s been a whisper network about it for awhile. All healthcare needs pretty much plan to fly to Vancouver or drive hours to Kelowna or Calgary. The fam doc waitlist is at least 3 years I think currently. I’ve been waiting over a year. I don’t think many people realize just how bad healthcare access is out here before they move- I’ve already heard twice this past month of people deciding to move to Calgary or Vancouver because the healthcare is really and I mean truly fucking abysmal. 

You can visit nature any time, but man healthcare is just a non-negotiable priority. Schools are shit here too.

"Why not just do all that stuff around the Okanagan? The Kootenays are nice but travelling should really be restricted right now..

I know this is discouraging but it's the best thing to do... That being said.... It doesn't prevent the Albertans from flooding in. Ainsworth is nice, Kokanee Creek provincial camp ground is nice, Nelson, Creston, Castlegar are all great towns. Creston is a little boring but small campsites on Kootenay lake are nice, Lockhart Provincial is a nice one with some trails for hiking nearby. Check the BC fishing regulations for open creeks and lakes. Most stuff is open for catch and release right now but double check, we are region 4.

"Great place to live, been here 4 years now, never leaving the area. If you like hiking, camping, hunting, fishing, atving, dirt biking, mountain biking, skiing, ect, it’s an amazing place to live. Plus it’s affordable compared to most other areas in the southern half of the province. Everyone is really friendly, but it’s not so small that everyone is in your business. 

If you’re more into a cute ski town, and don’t mind commuting half an hour to Cranbrook, Kimberley is also a nice place, but not really for me.

The town isn’t much to look at driving down the highway (aside from the amazing mountain views) but it’s definitely getting nicer, I’ve noticed a big change even in the last 4 years. I’m sure Covid has set that back a bit though.

The fires kinda suck. That said, I’ve only lived in southern BC, so in comparison it’s better than the rest of the interior. Less smoke on the coast, but you’ll still get it. Don’t move to BC if you can’t handle smoke, because you really can’t escape it entirely.

That's a great point. A great way to highlight the differences between Ontario and BC is a lot of the lakes are the on mountains. Many of which are dirt road access. In truth the lakes up the hills can be pretty sweet. And of all places can really feel like Ontario. crown camping being a thing is also a lot of fun on those mountain roads too.

"Hey man, I grew up in Ontario spending time between Ottawa and Wesport. Moved to Calgary about 2 years ago and I am moving to Nelson in the fall. 

This is my take on the Koots, Cranbrook is an awesome affordable place. If you are looking for the mountain town feel I would highly recommend kimberley and lots of people just commute everyday. 

Cranbrook as town is okay, just kind of a means to an end. If you already have employment lined up though that is a huge plus as that is a big issue in BC (finding employment that can sustain a living).

I personally prefer east or west of that valley so Fernie or Nelson/Rossland but thats because I do a ton of biking and hiking and skiing. Crankbrook has more Ontario hobbies like ATV and motocross. It is super warm in Crankbrook during winter so the winters will feel like a joke, they barely get any snow. 

Anyways all to say I would never move back to Ontario after having experienced the BC lifestyle its truly one of a kind. The fires kind suck this year but honestly they dont stop you from doing much.

"Yeah, it can get smoky. Every couple of years seems like we get a particularly bad fire season. But a wind shift or a different valley and it can be totally clear. 

Cranbrook has a bit more of a redneck feel - but I don’t say that in a bad or mean way. Just a bit more industry (forestry, mining) and the people who work in those fields tend to be more into quads or dirt bikes rather than hikes or mountain bikes, for example. 

Cranbrook is a bit colder in the winters than west Kootenay towns like Nelson, and summers across the southern interior are non-stop sunny and hot. 

Cranbrook also had a good airport, served by WestJet (through a small regional airline partnership, but it’s an easy connection to all WJ flights out of Calgary. 

Outdoor lifestyle is great, with lots of stuff within an easy drive. Like others have said - a vehicle is necessary to live there though, particularly if you want to access those good outdoor activities. 

Plus, you get a lot more bang for your housing buck in Cranbrook than you would in Nelson or Fernie, for example. 

Ive been in the West Kootenay (Nelson) for 26 years, also from Ontario. Spent lots of time in Cranbrook for work and to fly out of the airport.

Things I miss about Ontario 
-lakes for days
-the colour green 
-cottage country
-everything is much MUCH more accessible and the old Ontario towns r super dope. Especially Around Kingston and stuff. 
-big cities being accessible. Ur closest is Calgary and it's alright lol 
-the accents 
-the sky 
-fall season 

Things I don't miss 
-the culture 
-the humidity 
-the general conservatism 
-the fuck you I got mine shit 
-too many people 

Things I like about Cranbrook specifically 
-very friendly 
-access to amazing biking hiking and camping 
-ur close to all the classic Albertan vacation spots (fernie, Invermere, banff...) 
-it's super flat actually so u get HUGE mountain views. 
-looks like some of the nicest ranches in the province 
-traffic is a joke lol. Nobody lives here 😂

Things I don't like about Cranbrook 
-the town kinda sucks man 😂😂😂
-will not get that cozy small town Ontario feel. 
-you will need a vehicle to have fun here just straight up. 
-it's a weeeee bit red neck but from Eastern Ontario ur right on the mark. It will feel more hippy I imagine. Sort of a weird cross between mushroom headed hippies and Alberta Diesel burners 😂😂😂

I found my home here. I will never leave. 

Places I really like nearby

It is situated almost exactly (travel time) between Trail, Castlegar and Nelson, so depending on where people work it can serve as a bit of halfway point. A lot of people commute between towns for work in the area. The public transportation system is *very* limited between towns, so don't expect much for that.

"Red has amazing terrain, but only when it gets snow, and the last few years have been tough, as its base elevation is about 1300’ lower than Whitewater. Two years ago, Red couldn’t even get open over the Christmas holidays because of lack of snow at the bottom half of the mountain. 

Whitewater is high enough that you’re almost always guaranteed snow. 

The West Kootenay region doesn’t get really cold; it’s not uncommon for it to be raining at the lake in Nelson, wet slushy snow in uphill, and puking dry fluffy powder at Whitewater. 

Red’s cool, but Whitewater is unquestionably better. Better backcountry, better snow, cooler town. 

Kicking Horse and Revvy are huge, and definitely more ‘resort’. Even Red is trying to be a family-friendly resort for vacationers. 

Whitewater is for skiers and boarders who know what the good stuff is. It’s not a hill to learn on, or to bring family/friends who don’t really ski/ride. 

I’ve been skiing at Wh2O for 26 years. Even in the worst weather years, it’s always been good. And in most ‘normal’ years, it’s great. Many many days per season of waist deep cold smoke.

It has its own little ecosystem from the rest of the Kootenays. Which provides a lot of options for fresh local produce. Kootenay lake is right there for recreation.

Most of the stores are downtown. But it is limited hours and selection. When the border opens it is close enough to the USA for cross border shopping.

If flying is important, the nearest airport is 90 minutes away.

"Agreed!!  I think this idea of a fast electric train connecting the Southern Kootenays could have a huge benefit to the whole region as long as it was done properly.   It would boost the technology sector developing it.  The growth could be used to draw in large low impact businesses like big software companies.   Having that base  and local power would draw things like mega servers and data farms.

  It could spawn all manner of tourist venues. Ie hot springs, Cody caves, hiking, biking, lake tours, pontoon boat home rentals, airplane tours, landscape and wildlife photography course/tours. .........


To make it really go it should be very intentionally developed using the current tourism initiatives,  Columbia basin trust, all the towns.

"Forest fires are a concern everywhere in the area, there are things you can do to mitigate risk on your property. The real problem is smoke coming up from the states. Some years it is absolutely awful. Like apocalypse levels where you can't see across your yard. I would recommend a powerful HEPA filter and making sure your doors and windows seal properly, and maybe an AC unit if your place is a toaster, as opening a window is a no-go.

Kaslo is super cute, its got a great butcher shop. The ""hospital"" closes at 8pm so don't have a medical emergency at night.

"I'd agree with pretty much everything you said here, but I'd stress that in either town you are going to struggle without a vehicle. Both have public transit, but it's nothing like you're used to in Southern Ontario. A lot of routes have less than a half dozen trips a day. I'm not saying that you can't make it work, but you will certainly be at a disadvantage. For example, it is extremely difficult to find a rental in town, if you are unable to live even 5 min out of town that will definitely limit you.

I also ended up in the West Kootenays after living in both, for me I couldn't handle the insane tourism the East Kootenays gets (I lived in Fernie though, as someone who wants to be left alone it was awful).

"Omg go to Cranbrook.

I've gone to Selkirk for 2 different programs and its been a shit show both times. I feel like because Selkirk is the only college in the entire area they never have to worry about competition or improving what they already have. For example, in the 5 years between the programs I took, they didn't change their student email at all. The layout is shit, it looks like it was made in 2003, I could never recover a deleted email and I could never look at more than 10 emails at a time (which is its own problem because of the sheer amount of notification emails I would get from mandatory message board participation).

"Cranbrook is a larger city, however Castlegar has a a few other smaller cities within a half hour drive. Cranbrook is generally a bit colder, has some great views, and its flatter than the Castlegar area. However Castlegar also has some spectacular scenery, especially with the Kootenay and Columbia River systems (Kootenay River is close to Cranbrook too). 

I'm laughing out loud at your hospitals plural comment. Only one in each, Cranbrook has a bigger one. Castlegar has had their hospital staff/size/services cut way back, with the Kootenay Boundary Regional Hospital located in Trail taking over the load, about 20-25 minutes away (typical cost reductions). Airport in Cranbrook is easier to get into, ie less flights cancelled. Lots of lakes near both cities. 

Transit is probably similar, but since Cranbrook is bigger it's likely easier for you to get around the immediate town. There are transit links to the outlying cities around Castlegar (""cities"" being used loosely here). You'll find a couple gyms in either city, no idea what the selection in either is like though. 

Either college is decent, although I have limited experience with Cranbrook's College of the Rockies. Both have a few campuses in outlying communities.

Cranbrook is a good town, but imo the West Kootenays are where it's at. I have spent considerable time in both, outdoor recreation is plentyful in either, but for me the skiing in the West Kootenays is why I like it more. So that is person dependant. 

I don't think you'd go wrong in either. If it's any insight, my cousin went through some finance courses in Cranbrook and was happy with the outcome. I took some uni transfer through Selkirk College (Castlegar) and they are a decent school as well. Not sure what their accounting options look like.

"Having a car in Cranbrook:

Would it make things easier? Yes, probably. Is it necessary? No. Depends how mobile you are, how comfortable you are walking /biking. Great biking community out here and mild weather.  The campus is only a couple of km from everything. would largely depend on where you found a place to live.

Cranbrook is a growth economy. If you are halfway responsible and put yourself out there, i would argue a job should be easier to find than some other parts of Canada currently.

Again, not trying to knock Castlegar but it is a very quiet town, with a largely senior population.

"Ok a more serious answer....

Hmmm do the Kootenays compare to anywhere in the UK? Not really to be honest! I really think the the Koots are particularly unique. There's certainly a crossover between BC and Wales, somewhat wild and rugged. No doubt there is ample opportunity to be into horses here, and I would even argue that it is more organic, less elitist than the UK (just my opinion, my sister is big into horses and definitely runs with an elitist crowd..  - I could be totally wrong and don't mean to offend anyone either). The koots are incredibly special for the type of lifestyle they can offer, and if you can get a decent job and make it work then you might get an incredibly fulfilled life out of it. It has it all, as long as you are an active person and enjoy winter. 

There is certainly a strong community feel around. I get the sense that each little place seems to have it's own identity and community. Each town is very different to the next, I personally would not live in Trail but would Rossland (it does seem quiet but it's got a lot going on for such a small place and Red mountain reminds me of the Alps a bit). Okanagan is warmer so less winter but I don't know what it would be like to live there. Kamloops has a lot to offer and people really like it there but I personally think it's really ugly (sorry Kamloops... some awesome biking though!). I went in September and it was like a desert. 

What struck me about Canada is actually how foreign it is to the UK. We thought we were coming to a place with the same language and similar cultures to what we are used to but couldn't have been more wrong. I came from being surrounded by friends in England to struggling to make any real connections here, the kind of connections where you have meaningful conversation over a pint or something. There's so much stoke out here I find the majority of conversations are about whatever activity you are doing or whatever gear you are buying to do activities. On the plus side, I've made many friendly acquaintances through the plethora of activities on offer. I guess if you have kids you'll more than likely connect with lots of people through that so that's a big plus. Essentially, don't take the fact that it seems similar from the outside as a given that you'll be able to make an easy transition. (Again just my experience, others may find it different!). People always think I'm Australian, they don't get my jokes, and just generally seem to look at me with a quizzical face. But to their credit, people are real go getters around here and always doing something. There is an extreme lack of culture and sometimes you hear views/statements which were out of touch in the UK 20 years ago, but it's not really their fault, there just isn't the same multicultural landscape on offer. And you'd maybe be surprised by how out of touch Canada is with progressive environmental policies etc. Canadians are nice though, so used to everyone being a bit of a cunt in the UK. Kinda miss that though. 

Sorry for the ramble.. 

It is a big shift and change, plenty of people have done it and never looked back, but for myself - I'm going to have a shit hot time having fun here, and eventually return to the UK cus I love it there and think it's special in it's own way, and that's where I will settle down. I was more than happy to leave a couple of years ago though, but fuck do I miss a proper good pub! Blessed to be in BC during covid though. I often meet people here that say ""I could never go back"", and I get it. Lifestyle here is unreal. It all depends on your perspective I suppose and what you value most.

"Just reading through my local newspaper now and there are three articles relating to innocent people killed or seriously injured at random in downtown Nelson. One relates to Fiona Coyle who stabbed and seriously injured two people downtown in Sept 2019 during a psychotic episode that made her believe evil forces were pursuing her. The second relates to the recent sentencing of Miles Halverson for kicking another man in the head on downtown Baker street, causing his death. The third is about Nelson residents leaving lights on and putting candles out in remembrance of a man killed in a vicious attack on Baker street in downtown Nelson on 16 July.

"Rossland is likely your best bet. You say you work in healthcare... And the regional hospital is in Trail - not Nelson, not Castlegar. People have recommended Nelson, which is a larger centre and more widely known.  Nelson, however, is starting to have some serious problems with its very large homeless population - crime being one of those problems (a police officer was just murdered downtown last week). Drug abuse would be another. Nelson also puts you further from the mountains. In Rossland you're only 5 minutes from the chair lift. And Rossland's Red Mountain is almost twice the size of Nelson's Whitewater. For mountain biking, Rossland is Canada's mountain biking capital - and home to Canada's only IMBA Epic-rated trail. As for Cranbrook, I've heard people say it's an Alberta town... well, it kinda does feel that way. As for real estate, Rossland is pricey - but probably not more than Nelson. And with Rossland you also have great options in Warfield and Trail.  Castlegar is a great town as well - right on all kinds of water, if that interests you. Where Nelson probably does come out ahead is restaurants and entertainment - but won't matter much for the next year or two thanks to Covid-19. Nelson is also a more interesting, diverse community. You'll see much more body art, piercings, etc and a way wider range of fashion compared to Rossland.",t2_27ymxybj,Livid_Morning,0,1595690512.0,0,t1_fz7b7gq,fz7b7gq,True,trendnet0,t3_fquj0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/kootenays/comments/fquj0t/looking_for_advice/,Looking For Advice,/r/kootenays/comments/fquj0t/looking_for_advice/fz7b7gq/,1,r/kootenays,0,1

"Depending on what area of health care you’re in there are hospitals all around but the Cranbrook hospital is the largest. I came to Cranbrook because it’s not necessarily a large town but it has the hospital resources of a large city.

Anywhere you go in the Koots you’re going to find plenty of hiking and biking trails. Cranbrook is right between the Kimberley and Fernie ski hills and many people live in Kimberley and work at the Cranbrook hospital.

"Most people here will probably recommend Nelson. I live in Creston and would also recommend either Nelson or Creston. It's very hard to find something to rent in Creston, houses also seem like they're fairly over priced here.. A lot of people trying to sell garbage for the price of gold.

If you can, try to visit each town for a week or something and decide. Probably not the easiest thing to do though.

"Kaslo is honestly a great place to start a family, though work is the real difficulty. If your husband is specialized as a contractor (in a specific trade such as plumbing or electrician) chances are he'll find work BUT you have to be involved in the community and a positive influence. Reputation is a big part of it. 

As for children, it's a really great place to raise children from ages 0- probably 13, the real issue is a lack of big things to do. Nature and the wilderness surrounds you and teenagers (speaking from some experience) typically want to get social and do extravagant stuff. This typically leads to a party culture. 

It can be really difficult if you want a really large life, but if your happy with a smaller, happily content life, the kaslo is the place to go
