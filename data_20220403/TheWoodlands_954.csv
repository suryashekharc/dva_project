You could consider Hulu Live. I just signed up and get all the channels for $79. I have low cost internet. You can have two users on it and plenty of dvr options. The problem with the antenna is that PBS and KHOU are in different directions than the rest. I can get KHOU with a cheapie 70 mile range antenna and not in the attic. but then I have to move it to the get rest. Hulu I can watch on anything and get loads of channels at about half the price of cable.,t2_6jz24d96,LoopyLouDoWho,0,1648483346.0,0,t1_i2g9obr,i2g9obr,False,ccbbb23,t3_tpvq17,https://www.reddit.com/r/thewoodlands/comments/tpvq17/digital_tv_antennae_tabletop_not_wall_or_attic/,Digital TV Antennae - Tabletop not wall or attic mounted - which do you have?,/r/thewoodlands/comments/tpvq17/digital_tv_antennae_tabletop_not_wall_or_attic/i2g9obr/,1,r/thewoodlands,0,1

"Hiya, it was a good livestock show, rodeo, and carnival.

The traditional rides were there too. It certainly isn't Six Flags, but it is okay and cheap and spread out a lot that you aren't on top of each other.  

It is kinda like that old story, city mouse, country mouse. Each side has its pluses and minuses. I have to wear a mask due to a double lung transplant. And at the fairgrounds, no one gave me any grief, mean looks, or anything. And I have gotten a lot of grief, from some rabid anti-vax people about wearing a mask. Meh.

"I've used three different movers for apartment moves. Here's my recommendations of the two best. Both moved me quickly from one place to the next without a SINGLE scratch on the furniture. Both were single story moves. Both were very reasonable in price. One move took longer than another because I had to pickup furniture at another place.   


Both will give you an estimate over the phone / email with no commitment. If I were you, I'd clean out all your personal stuff and just let them move the rest. Saves your back! 

One of the best, not a scratch. Extremely quick.

"In the last few weeks schools districts have received letters from Paxton threatening districts from having Pride Week; many books have been banned and at least one Librarian in Llano fired, and Abbott has threatened to treat parents and teachers of trans kids as criminals. Plus there‚Äôs been the long standing pandemic related questions about remote teaching, mask wearing and AISD specifically had to return a massive amount of tax dollars and fire a significant amount of essential staff. 

Texas republicans have essentially declared war on our education system, it‚Äôs staff and teachers, parents and mostly Texas children.

Teachers are already grossly underpaid, there‚Äôs a massive shortage of teachers because during the pandemic many of them found other ways to pay their bills, retired, surely hundreds died from Covid, etc.  Add to that the GOP going to war against our kids; more stress on our teachers and absolutely more reason to leave red states for the safety of their families.

"I worked at The Gap one summer long, long ago.  
Their style (for guys) largely hasn't changed with fashion trends for younger shoppers (if your brand is going to be trendy, you have to track younger tastes).  
Their signature pique polo shirts never fit/lay well and their button-down oxfords were very hit-and-miss on how they fit.  

It's weird because Banana has managed to always track whatever a more mature, professional, discerning crowd wears; Old Navy has managed to always appeal to the ""fast fashion""/budget crowd (largely), but Gap never was able to find its own identity.  

Even as Gap corporate was able to see trends and capitalize on them, as seen with Athleta, Gap retail stores never created a truly loyal following. In the 80 they were a popular new brand at the shopping malls, they catered to the 80s prep vibe (polo shirts, bulky sweatshirts), then in the 90s when khakis were *it*, and later the cargo pants/shorts of the 2000s, they were banking. It's largely been a slow slide ever since.  

Can anyone describe what niche The Gap fills? What is the look you get from The Gap? I certainly can't and that's probably why they're underperforming and closing.

"\+1 for heat/humidity. 

 I grew up in western Illinois, but the humidity in Texas is something I've never been able to adequately describe to my Midwestern family. (I've been trying for 30 years.)

 You will get cabin fever in August, after it has been 98 degrees and 80% humidity for months on end.  WInter is those 2 days in february when the power goes off. When I go home for Xmas, my mom asks ""Where is your coat?""  I didn't own one, for years.

The woodlands specific comments i'd add:  It's easy to get lost, because the laws limit sign height, trees block the view, and the roads are intentionally convoluted.  I still need a GPS to get around, if some place is more than a few turns from my house.  Sometimes just looking for gas to fuel up is a pain, because you can't see the sign until you are on top of a place.

"assuming that you mean the waterway and market street-ish area are the touristy places that you mean, the best thing about living in the Woodlands is combining those areas alongside living in the neighborhood woods areas that make it ""the Woodlands"".

that's as local as it will get. i find that google maps-ing restaurants, grocery stores, parks and visiting them will get you out there and finding some neat and new places to see, and find some gems you'll want to revisit. biking, running, and driving around will add to those adventures. that's what sets this place apart from most Houston areas in general. you have the ability to safely explore through the trails to explore the whole place, as it is mostly all connected.

Compared to Sugarland, Katy, Cypress? Yes, The Woodlands is the most racist suburb Houston has to offer compared to them. When it comes to tax brackets, Sugarland is comparable yet its even more diverse than The Woodlands. Why might that be? Hm... a mystery.

Is The Woodlands comparable to a sundown town? Absolutely not. But there is a definite, distinct reason why minorities make up less than 5% of the growth up here according to the monthly newsletter. 

I'm curious why you didn't address the point of the openly displayed Confederate flags on vehicles around here? The rallies on 1488 showing Confederate flags alongside the political flags? 

Also, haven't you noticed the distinct lack of diversity in schools, small business, and new homeowners (compared to Sugarland or even Dallas which is much more expensive)?

You can go on little adventures and visit all of the restaurants and bars. The woodlands, like any area surrounding Houston, is full of restaurants and bars, but going to the Heights and downtown can feel like taking a vacation from the suburbs. You might later opt to move into Houston.  Join social media groups for ""things to do in Houston"". Take a class at the gym or a college course. Or simply sign up for a ""Painting with a twist"" class. You'll meet people. Don't worry. I will warn you, most people in the suburbs are comfortable there and don't want to leave, particularly because you have everything you could ever need there. There is a silent war in Houston between the old folks that established the rules, and the younger generations that want to shake things up and embrace change. Maybe the woodlands needs you.",t2_hdceyjux,mayra144,0,1647311600.0,0,t1_i0p8kaw,i0p8kaw,True,jrib937,t3_te3cvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/thewoodlands/comments/te3cvw/should_i_move/,Should I move?,/r/thewoodlands/comments/te3cvw/should_i_move/i0p8kaw/,0,r/thewoodlands,0,0

The Woodlands is ""Mainly Married, Middle Age, coming up on Menopause with kids"".

And if he's wanting to be closer to his family, if his family doesn't like you much, or decides not to like you...it makes it real hard.

"The Woodlands is geographically a great area, living among so many trees is a huge plus. However, the community is pretty bad, and it's hard to fit in unless you have kids and/or join one of the ""charitable organizations"", which are just sororities that pretend to raise money for charities (their websites are hilariously vague on what they do). 

And generally, as you can see from a lot of these comments, people aren't very welcoming. I (26M) moved here a few years ago and have managed to make a single friend, and that's only because he was a coworker. All my local friends stayed inside the 610 loop, so visiting always entails 30-60 minutes of travel. And as there isn't much to do in the Woodlands, heading into Houston is what I often do anyway. 

Edit: all that being said, it's definitely a lot cheaper to live here than Austin. I have a house with a pool with a smaller mortgage than a one-bedroom apartment in Austin.

"It depends on your race for The Woodlands. If you're worried about diversity go to Houston. 

If you're a minority unless you socially align yourself and make physical changes to conform you will have a tough time making friends. I know Reddit warriors hate to hear it, but its the honest God-given truth. Be prepared for snobby small business owners giving you rude service, security following you around stores, and realtors not calling you back (even if you're prequalified).

Namely, everyone assumes you are mostly right leaning and if you're not, you're a carpet bagger leaving a destroyed liberal city.

"We moved here from DC (Bethesda) about five years ago and it has been completely fine.

My neighbor across the street had a trump sign and we shoot the breeze all the time about the things we do have in common. It‚Äôs nice. The thing about the Woodlands is that most of the people here are transplants for work (mostly oil and gas) so there is more diversity of thought and background than you might think. Montgomery county as a whole is very homogeneous but the woodlands itself is a little different. It‚Äôs not nearly as diverse as Houston itself but it‚Äôs nice to have a mix of ideas.

Also after living in Galveston a few years (moved there from East Texas) I discovered that southern hospitality pretty much dies once you cross the Causeway onto the island.

">!I wouldn't want to be part of gentrification.!<

That made me laugh.  Need to head closer to Houston if you are worried about that.  Woodlands is mostly middle class to multi-million dollar homes.

Anyway.  I'm from Virginia, been in Utah last 4 years, and now here.  People are friendly and welcoming. Utah a pretty friendly/nice place and I find Texas people even more friendly/nicer. If go full liberal crazy, well, I don't know maybe your experience will be different (shrug).  I think regardless of politics if you treat those around you with respect the same will be reciprocated here.  People coming from extreme left leaning areas I don't think understand the false picture painted by the media of conservative states.  Here it's more about, leave us alone and we will do the same.  Mess with us, we're going to mess with you.  But we rather just be left alone to live our lives freely.

I don't think it'll be a problem.  Whenever I hear people from liberal states make these comments it makes me chuckle.  Think you will be surprised how false the narrative is towards conservative areas.  I could be totally wrong though :p.

"The Woodlands is basically all ""outsiders"" and has a large number of educated professionals. Growing up, all my friends' parents were from somewhere else, including Kenya, the Philippines, Mexico, Indonesia, Peru, China, Taiwan, Vietnam and all over the lower 48, so being from CA, NYC or DC is nothing. There are also plenty of oil and petrochemical business people too--engineers, geologists and chemists, etc. from all over, including Louisiana, Dallas, the UK, France, etc.  
   
However, my dad's car had a Clinton-Gore sticker on it, and I do remember that thing got keyed to shit, so there is no shortage of petty useless assholes. Conversely, he was still active in Rotary, ran a small business, and won some pretty heated local elections. And I do mean heated.   
   
If you're thinking of getting into local politics, I'd say you need a strong stomach, especially with the current political climate, but just socially-speaking, anyone who would exclude you from their community for being an ""outsider"" is probably not a very neighborly Texan and definitely not someone you would want to spend time with. 

That being said, the political climate seems to be getting crazier.

"Home prices roughly doubled because we printed ~40% more money than has ever existed. No, really. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL 

* Feb 2019: $15.740 Trillion
* Jan 2022: $21.840 Trillion

21.840 / 15.740 = 1.3875, or roughly 40% more money than has ever existed.

The true extent of our money printing is far, far worse than this 40% number, but they stopped publishing the M3 money supply number because it became too horrifying at how fast the money was being devalued.

Homes get their prices from loans, because most people buy with a loan. The Fed prints money and loans that money to banks at a very low rate (0.1% or less). The banks then use that money to create mortgages and other loan products at much higher interest rates (3-4% currently). The bank makes the 3% interest vs what they owe to the Federal Reserve as profit.

The home gets its price from a real estate agent. When you go to sell your house, the only idea of its worth comes from your property taxes, or what your neighbors happened to sell for, if any sold recently. But 99% of people ask their real estate agent ""how much should I list for?"" and go with that. So the real estate agents see the money supply doubled, know loans are easy to get and interest rates are low, and double the price of the home. Why? They get 3% of the sale price, so the higher the price, the more money they make.

Do not think for a second that the value of the home is the price on the sticker. That price is pulled out of the air (or possibly brown-air). So, if you want something to feel salty about, then here are all the things to be salty about. Home prices are rigged, the market is rigged, some old fucks printed money to bail out people playing 2008-style games in the economy, and you are stuck holding the bag.

"I would fully agree with your comments under normal circumstances, however there is nothing normal about the current market. Home prices are skyrocketing and most experts I‚Äôve read are not predicting prices to drop or even level off. I‚Äôve been very closely watching the market for two years. In that time home prices at the lower end have nearly doubled. A home in my neighborhood sold for $265,000 less than two years ago and an identical floor plan in worse condition just sold for $400,000 a month ago. 

The real issue is not even the price, it the ability to get an offer in. It is like a shark feeding frenzy when a home hits the market and there is almost no new inventory. Housing inventory is down 42% over this time last year, which was already down over the norm.

"I appreciate your insights and I fully agree with most of your comments. I‚Äôm not driven to Foster‚Äôs Ridge out of desire for newer or bigger.

Homes are snatched up quickly, often before the even hit the market and bidding wars are driving the costs up to 40% over asking prices, which are already inflated. Even if I could find a smaller home in my price range (which there are some) they are pending before I even know they are for sale, or the bidding gets ridiculous and prices me out of the market. 

New allows me to buy without the bidding wars and to get a home before offers are in. I just don‚Äôt see any other option, but I still want The Woodlands schools.

"Defund a portion of the police budget i this county because the number of police is entirely unnecessary for such a low population county. I've had horrible experiences with them and they have way more officers than would ever be necessary and unnecessary/absurd amounts military surplus equipment. They are predators and I recommend never to go Montgomery county late night. They seek out cars that they can isolate away from the view if other citizens and do whatever they can to find a probable cause to arrest you. They disregard probable cause as well, and you can be stopped 
while parked and eatinf your meal at Whataburger. I was completely sober and was arrested while eating my meal so it would not be cold at home. I was parked and watched them they lied to my face with their claim they drove by thee times and somehow that's probable cause i. Their minds despite never seeing me drive. They refued to allow me to take a breathalyzer twice and my blood has already shown there was no alcohol. I don't use any illegal drugs, rarely drink, and take my prescriptions as directed by ny doctor. They have absolutely no proof and it may go to trial if they're too proud to admit they made a mistake and I was targeted as part of a quota system. When thw carges are dropped, I'm seeing a litigator to look into suing them for return of the $15k it has cost me over the past year. Any damages would be a bonus, but I mostly just want to be made whole. It's made me terrified of all police and I about them like the plaguqe. If any of you don't believe you can be arrested for DUI while completely sober and not even driving to provide probable cause, too bad. I have the court paperwork tor all of it. I can't wait to finally get the toxicology back after almost a year and see their disappointment that I truly was 100% innocent.

If they want to go to trial, I'm perfectly willing to take this to trial because theres no way they'll get 12 of my peers to destroy the career I worked all my life to get over a DUI arrest when I was absolutely 100% sober. I told them I recently suffered 2 concussion and had some seizures that hospitalized me due to the intensity of the brain swelling. One cause me to hit a large mirror and slive my face, hands, and scalp open... The latter requiring 7 staples to close. One of those 12 jurors will not be unanimous and cause a mistrial.

"Exxon laid off / fired a very, very large number of Spring campus employees during COVID. So many that they were actually able to cancel the ~ 18 floors of space they leased in Hugh‚Äôs Landing and move those people to main campus

Most people probably don‚Äôt understand the scale of the Spring campus ~ it‚Äôs the size of a small university and it can hold up to 15k employees. There are like 16-20 buildings, each with between 3 and 6 floors that are massive. It takes 10 minuted to cross campus at a brisk pace

Imo Exxon is kicking themselves for building that campus. Had they still been leasing office space across Houston when COVID hit, my guess is that they‚Äôd have cancelled the majority of those leases, moved most workers to full remote, and axed fewer employees

But they didn‚Äôt and they don‚Äôt believe in the sunk cost fallacy, so they were very pushy with employees, mandating office returns in May 2020 (which lasted til June 2020) and again in Oct 2020. The horrible thing was that you weren‚Äôt really allowed to work with your team face to face anyways. You went to campus just to sit on zoom calls exactly the same as you would at home. They just wanted to justify the insane price tag on the campus

Anyways, I‚Äôm excited to see what that campus will become in ~20 years when Exxon is long gone",t2_120ode,relefos,0,1643706692.0,0,t1_hv41r8a,hv41r8a,False,grendelt,t3_sh82x3,https://www.reddit.com/r/thewoodlands/comments/sh82x3/exxon_to_move_headquarters_to_the_woodlandsspring/,Exxon to move headquarters to The Woodlands/Spring,/r/thewoodlands/comments/sh82x3/exxon_to_move_headquarters_to_the_woodlandsspring/hv41r8a/,5,r/thewoodlands,0,5

"Former CEO Rex Tillerson was married to a Dallas snob and would never move. But the ops and engineers needed to be closer to the plants where the work is being done.  
It used to be done in the ""white house"" and a smaller campus in Baytown along Bayway. That facility is still there but is for heads of units there in Baytown (I believe).  

But Exxon HQ has never been with the workers. Exxon's HQ was in NYC for a long time before moving to Las Colinas in the late 80s. Humble Oil's HQ was in downtown Houston back when almost all critical operations were in Baytown.

---

A C-suite need not be right on top of the ""worker bees"" (if you want to call the white collar jobs at campus that --- I think that's more like the blue collars in Baytown, Beaumont, Baton Rouge, etc.)  
Many CEOs work in offices removed from their operational centers. It *seems* like they need to be under the same roof, but that's somewhat of an outdated management model. Now with communications as they are, you can get plenty done remotely. The C-level chiefs rarely need direct interaction with those carrying out the details.  

To look at it another way, a General does not need to be in the trenches - he needs to mentally be in all the trenches so he can ""see the battlefield"" and understand what is happening on a grader scale. Keeping the Generals apprised are Colonels who oversee areas, Majors who oversee more junior officers and report major information up the chain of command. Too much information of no value can overload those at the top and they will miss the important key information because it's clouded by too many details.  
That same ""do what is asked by your superior, filter information from the results and pass the most pressing issues back up"" works well in a global corporation as it does in a battlefield.  

The vital link is having the information at hand to make informed decisions and modern workplace tools facilitate all that.

"The Board of Directors aren't necessarily coming to the office each day nor do they necessarily live close to the company for which they serve.

"Fyi I've worked Real Estate in these areas and agreed the market is tough but there are some tactics to winning the fight(seriously it's a fight these days). I haven't won them all for my buyers(I'm a Realtor) but typically if you have asking price and your loan is conventional you have better chances. I also usually take care of most (moderate) repairs on the inspection which eases that part, I have a handyman and can handle alot myself. If you have an fha loan switching over to conventional isn't hard at all( I'm also a mortgage lender) and increases your inventory considering investor bought homes flipped that need 90 days to qualify through fha. As someone said and it's true, some sellers want to sell at their number and quick so they take the first ""asking price"" offer, bless those sellers lol. But you have to be first, none of this waiting for the weekend or on my lunch break, might even make the offer on your agents opinion considering they hopefully have a good idea what you want, short option period which gives you time to view it.

"There isn't anything to do here in the Woodlands- why would someone leave a cultural center that is Houston to come to an extremly white-homogenous suburbs. 

There's no museums or cultural offerings here. All the decent restaurants are continental or gringo Tex-Mex or mall food, sure there is 'nature' (essentially just a lot of pine trees). 

Maybe they'd come for a show at the pavilion which is pretty nice, but that doesn't get many of the newer popular music and tends to be bands like Journey or Kings of Leon that have typically crested (though Dead and Co did come recently admittedly).

What, in your opinion, would be the draw from someone to visit The Woodlands?
